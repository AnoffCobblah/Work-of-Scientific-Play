   Report of the Council of the British Association, presented to the
               General Committee, Wednesday, August 19, 1868.

   The Council have received Eeports from the General Treasurer, and from
the Ivew Committee at each of their Meetings, and their Reports for the past

year will be laid before the General Committee.
    0-«ang to the death of Lord Wrottesley, the Chairman and most active

member of the Parliamentary Committee, no Report of this Committee is

presented this year.

   At their Meeting on March 14th, Mr. F. Galton, General Secretary, in-
formed the Council that considerations of health precluded him, to his sincere
regret, from continuing to hold office. The Council, in accordance with their

previous practice, appointed a Committee, consisting of the General Secre-

taries and the gentlemen who had formerly filled that office, for the purpose

of reporting a recommendation to the Council of a successor to Mr. Galton.

From this Committee the Council have received the following Report :
" Resolved that Dr. T. Thomson, F.R.S., &c., be recommended as highly
qualified for election as Joitit- General Secretary of the Association." The
Council recommend that Dr. T. Thomson be now elected Joint-General Secre-

tary.

    At the last Meeting of the Association the General Committee referred to

the Council a Ptcsolution relating to the administration of the Natural- History

Collections of the British Musenm, in whicli it was recommended to press on
the Government the importance of transferring the control of these Collections
from the Board of Trustees to a single officer of Government responsible to
Parliament. After deliberating on the Report of a Committee specially

appointed to consider the qvicstion, the Council sent a deputation to urge on
the Government the desirability of making the proposed changes.

    Professor Martins, of Montpellier, and Professor Mannheim, of Paris, who

attended the Meeting of the Association at Dundee, have been elected Cor-
responding Members by the Council.

    The Annual Report of the Association for last year has been issued in an
improved form and at an earlier date than usual. It is hoped that with the
cooperation of the Authors of Ptcports it may in future be published at a still
earlier period, and thereby its utility much increased.

    Owing to the modifications made at the Birmingham Meeting, in the
 arrangements of Section D, the Council have had under consideration the
 advisability of omitting the word " Ethnology " in the designation of Section
E. They recommend that a Resolution to this eifect be passed by the

General Committee.

    The Council have been informed that invitations for 1869 will be presented

--by Deputations from Exeter, Liverpool, Edinburgh, and Brighton; and an

invitation for the following year, by a Deputation from Bradford.

REPORT OP THE KEW COMMITTEE.  XXXIX

     Report of the Kew Committee of the British Association for the

                         Advancement of Science for 1867-68.

    The Committee of the Kew Observatory submit to the Council of the British

 Association the following statement of their proceedings during the past

year :--

    The Meteorological Office, to which allusion was made in the last Eeport,

continues in operation, Kew being the Central Observatory as aiTanged with

 the Meteorological Committee appointed by the Council of the Eoyal Society
In consequence of this arrangement there has been during the past year a con-

siderable access of work to the Kew Observatory, and the duties imdertaken

by that establishment may, as in the. last Keport, for clearness' sake, be again
 considered under the two following heads :

      (A) The work done by the Kew Observatory uader the Direction of the

                     British Association.

      (B) That done at Kew as the Central Observatory of the Meteorological

                   Committee.

    This system of division wiU therefore be adopted in this Report ; but it

ought to be mentioned that the financial statement appended to it refers only

to the first of these divisions, since the work done at Kew for the Meteoro-

logical Committee has been paid from funds supplied by the Committee, and

not in any way from money subscribed by the British Association.

     (A) WOEK DONE BY KeW ObSERVATOET UNDEE THE DiEECTION OF THE

                                              British Association.

  --1. J^ew Instruments for CoJaba Observatory. The Chairman of the Kew

Committee, shortly after the Meeting at Dundee, received a communication
from Mr. Chambers, the Superintendent of the Colaba Observatoiy, Bombay,

requesting the support of the Kew Committee in his application to the India

Board for a supply of Self-recording Magnetographs and other instruments
required for his observatory. This was ultimately brought before the Council
of the British Association ; and in consequence of the steps taken. Sir Stafford
JSTorthcote, in a letter to General Sabine, dated 30 January, 1868, sanctioned

the supply of new instruments for the observatory at Bombay, while General

Sabine, on behalf of the Kew Committee, undertook to select the following

instruments required :

     A(1) set of Self-recording Magnetometers for registering by photo-

                   graphy changes of Declination, Horizontal Force, and Vertical

                      Force.

        (2) Thomson's Electrometer, arranged for photographic self-registration.

     A(3) Self-recording Barograi)h and Thermograph, of the pattern

                   adopted by the Meteorological Committee (added afterwards).
       (4) Apparatus for measuring and tabulating the curves given by the

                   above-named instruments.

       (5) Photographic apparatus, porcelain dishes, and boxes for paper and
                    photograms.

       (6) Mofi"at's Ozonometer, in box with clockwork and rotating cylinder.
       (7) Beam-compasses, with steel points and tangent screw adjustment to

                  measure 4 feet (for verification of distances in deflection experi-

                     ments).

        (8) Rotating frame with large glass jar for testing thermometers.

 --2. Magnetic worh. The Self-recording Magnetographs, ordered by the
xl REPORT 1868.

India Board for Mr. Chambers, have been verified at Kew, and returned to
the India Office, from which they have been doubtless despatched ere this to
Bombay.

  A Differential Declinometer (received from General Sabine's Office) has

been verified at Kew for Dr. Lemstrom, who has gone out as physical

observer with the Spitzbergen expedition.

   A Unifilar has been received at Kew for Mr. Meldrum, of the Mauritius

Observatory, and its constants are in progress of being determined.

    Senhor Viegas, of Coimbra, and Lieutenant lelagiu, of the Imperial Eussian

"Nayj, have received magnetic instruction at Kew ; and a Dip-circle has been

prepared for the latter gentleman, who purposes making observations with it

at the various European Observatories,

   The usual monthly absolute determinations of the magnetic elements con-
tinue to be made by Mr. Whipple, magnetic assistant ; and the Self-recording
Magnetographs are in constant operation as heretofore, also under Mr.
Whipple, who has displayed much care and ability in the discharge of his

duties.

    The photographic department connected with the Self-recording instru-

ments is under the charge of Mr. Page, assisted by Mr. Foster, both of whom

discharge their duties very satisfactorily.

   An arrangement connected with the instrumental clock for shutting off the

light every two hours, and thereby increasing the accuracy of the time-scale,
originally devised by Mr. Beckley, in connexion with the self-recording
meteorological instruments, has been adapted to the Kew, and also to the

Mauritius and Bombay Self-recording Magnetographs, and the time-scale of

the Kew Magnetographs has been made the same as those of the other

instruments.

    It was proposed in the last Ecport that the task of tabulating and reducing

the magnetic curves produced at Kew subsequently to January 1865 should
be performed by the staff at Kew working under the direction of Mr. Stewart.

In accordance with this resolution 787 curves, being those of the declination
from February 18G5 to April 1867, have been measured for every hour, and
the process of reduction of these measurements is well advanced.

    The magnetical observations made at Ascension by Lieut. Rokeby, R.M.,
have been nearly reduced by Mr. "S^Tiipple, and it is proposed to communicate

the results to the lloyal Societ}^

  A comparison of the Kew and Lisbon mngnetic curves during the magnetic

storm of February 20-25, 1866, made by Senhor Capello, of the Lisbon
Observatory, has been communicated to the Eoyal Society, and will be found

published in their Proceedings for May 28, lb68,
   Mr. Stewart has likewise received from Senhor Capello a short paper, " On

the reappearance of certain periods of Declination disturbance during two,
three, or several days," wliich he proposes to communicate to the Royal

Society.

   The Eev. W. Sidgreaves and Mr. Stewart have been engaged in making

intercomparisons of simultaneous chsturbances of the declination at Stony-

hm-st and at Kew, for both of which stations the instruments have the same
scale. It would appear from these that during slow disturbances there is an
absolute identity between the indications of the two instruments, even to

their most minute features. On the other hand, the more abrupt distur-
bances appear to be exaggerated at Stonyhurst as compared with Kew to an

extent which appears (at first sight) to depend upon the abruptness. Messrs.
Sidgreaves and Stewart are investigating this phenomenon, which has clearly
                                                             REPOKT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.                        xli

a physical and not an instrumental origin, and purpose communicating their

--results in a joint paper to the Eoyal Society.
   3. Meteorolotjical WorJc. The meteorological work of the Observatory
continues in the charge of Mr. Baker, who executes his duties veiy satis-

factorily.

   Since the Dundee Meeting, 78 Barometers have been verified, and 71 are
at present in hand ; 1139 Thermometers have likewise been verified, and 14
Standai'd Thermometers have been constructed for the Thermographs of the
Meteorological Committee. 32 Thermograph Thermometers have Hkewise

been tested, 24 of these being for the Meteorological Committee and 8 for

opticians.

  The self-recording meteorological instruments now at work at Kew wUl

be again mentioned in the second division of this Report. These are in the
charge of Mr. Baker, the Photography being superintended by Mr. Page.

   Mr. liobert Addams has kindly made a preliminary experiment with his
apparatus for freezing carbonic acid, which is now at Kew, and has also

left specific instructions regarding it, so that the operation can in future be
performed without assistance. The point corresponding to the temperature

of freezing mercury has been determined for two Thermometers belonging to

the Meteorological Committee.

   The Self-recording Barographs, Thermographs, and Anemographs for the
sis outlying Observatories of the Meteorological Committee have been verified

at Kew. A Self-recording Barograph and Thermograph have hkewise been

verified for Messrs. R. and J. Beck, opticians ; and the verification of another
set for Mr. Chambers, of the Colaba Observatory, has been very recently

completed.

   The experiments made on Anei'oids at Kew, by the request and at the ex-

pense of the Meteorological Committee, have formed the subject of a com-
munication recently made to the Royal Society by that bod3'.

 --4. PhotoheUof/raph. The Kew Heliograph, in charge of Mr. DeLaRue, con-

tinues to be worked in a satisfactory manner. Dui'ing the past year 224

negatives have been taken on 140 days. 90 pictures of the Pagoda in Kew

Gardens have hkewise been taken, in the hope of being able by this means

to determine accurately the angular diameter of the Sun.

    Since the last Meeting of the Association, a series of solar researches,

in continuation of the second series, has been pubhshed (the expense of

printing having been defrayed by Mr. De La Rue), entitled "Researches on

--Solar Physics. Appendix to Second Series. On the Distribution in Heho-

graphic Latitudes of the Sun-spots observed by Carrington ; by Messrs. De
La Rue, Stewart, and Loewy."

   Two papers have likewise been commimicated to the Royal Society by

these gentlemen. The fii'st of these is entitled " Researches on Solar Physics.

Heliographical Positions and Areas of Sun-spots observed with the Kew

Photoheliograph during the years 1862 and 1863."

   The second is entitled " Account of some Recent Observations on Sun-spots,

made at the Kew Observatory."

Sun-spots continue likewise to be niimbered after the manner of Hofrath

Schwabe                                                 and  a Table, exhibiting  the  monthly groups  observed  at Dessau
                                                     ;

and at Kew for the year 1867, has been commimicated to the Astronomical

Society, and pubhshed in their Monthly Notices.

The measurements of the Kew pictures for the year 1864 are approaching

completion ; when complete, they will be communicated to the Royal

Society. It is intended to work up rapidly the back years, preparatory to

a final discussion.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

--xlii REPORT 1868.

   Mr. De La Eue has recently received a letter from M. Struve, in ·which it

is stated that the arrival at Kew of M. Berg, of the Wihia Observatory, in

--order to practise with the Photoheliograph, may he shortly expected.
    5. Apparatus for Verifying Sextants. Several determinations have been
made of the angular distances between the collimators of this instrument
but the result appears to indicate a greater want of fixedness in these than
is desirable. Should, however, the apparatus come to be extensively employed

for the verification of sextants, this may be overcome by means of frequent

--determinations of these angular distances by a theodolite.
    6. Miscellaneous Worh. The time and attention of the Observatory Staff
have been so much absorbed dirring the last year with the regular work of
the Observatory, that little or no progress has been made in miscellaneous

experiments.

   The instrument devised by Mr. Broun for the purpose of estimating the
magnetic dip by means of soft iron, remains at present at the Observatory,
awaiting Mr. Broun's return to England.

   The Superintendent has received grants from the Eoyal Society for special
experiments ; and when these are completed, an account will be rendered to

that Society.

(B) WOEK DONE AT KeW AS THE CeNTEAL ObSERVATOET OF THE

                          Meteoeological Committee.

This work may be divided into four heads, the first of these being the arrange-

ment of seK-recording meteorological instruments, theu- verification at Kew,

and erection at the various stations ; the second being the arrangement of a

system of  tabulating  from the automatic records of  these  instruments                                                      the
                                                                                                                           ;

third being the arrangement of a system by means of which the continued

accuracy of the instruments themselves, and of their tabulated records, may
be secured ; while the fourth is the work done at Kow as being itself one

of the Observatories of the Meteorological Committee.

 --1. Arrangenient,VeriJication,andEreHionof Self-recording Instruments. In

the last Report of this Committee a short accoimt was given of the principles

of construction of the system of self-recording meteorological instruments

arranged at Kew, comprising the Thermograph, Barograph, and Anemograph.

A more detailed account has since been given by the Meteorological Com-

mittee in their Report to Parliament for the year 1867, and it is therefore

unnecessary to enter here into the subject. It ought, however, to be men-

tioned that the principle adopted in these instruments is to check the accuracy

of their automatic records by means of reference to standards ; and with this

view the Kew Committee have constructed a Standard Wet and Dry Bulb

Thermometer for each Thermograph, and has verified a Standard Barometer

for each Barograph. When the various self-recording instramcnts had been

completed by the opticians, they were sent to Kew, where they were ex-

amined and verified. They were then dispatched to their respective sta-

tions in charge of the observer, who had been previously instructed at Kew

and finally, Mr. Beckley, Mechanical Assistant at Kew, went to ihe various

stations and superintended the erection of the instruments. By his aid this

--was accomplished in a very thorough and satisfactory manner.
    2. System of Tabulation. It is not proposed to discuss here the system of

tabulation. This has already been done, to a certain extent, in the Report of

the ^Meteorological Committee presented to Parliament ; and the whole sub-

ject wiU, it is hoped, be fully treated of on some future occasion. Suffice

it to say, that the system of tabulation was arranged at Kew, and that the
tabulating instruments were all verified there before being sent to their

--respective observatories.
   3. Verification of Records. It has already been mentioned that the com-

petency of the observers at the various stations to undertake the charge of

the self-recording instruments was secured by a course of instruction at

Kew, where they became acquainted with the principles of construction of

the various instruments, with the photographic process necessary to obtain

curves, and with the system of tabulation. In addition to this, the instru-

ments were erected at the various stations by Mr. Beckley, and each observer

was thus well started. It is not, however, enough, in a project of this

nature, to secure a good beginning ; it is, moreover, indispensable to see that

the standard of excellence is maintained.

For this purpose it is proposed by the Meteorological Committee that Mr.

Stewart should personally visit all the Observatories every year ; in addition

to which, some one of the Kew assistants might occasionally visit some station,

with a specific object in view. Mr. Stewart has already visited Stonyhurst,

Glasgow, and Aberdeen ; and, in addition to the preliminary visit to the

various stations made by Mr. Beckley, Mr. Whipple has visited Falmouth.

KewBesides this inspection, it is also necessary to check at  the accuracy

Aof the tabulated results that arrive there from the various stations.  close

and constant scrutiny of these results is therefore made at Kew ; and when

any error is detected, it is brought before the notice of the observer who made

it. All this involves a very considerable amount of labour, more especially

at the commencement of the undertaking, and until the various observatories

are in thorough working order. For the purpose of securing accuracy and

uniformity in the reduction of the records of these instruments, it has been

proposed that a set of rules should be drawn up under the sanction of this

Committee.

 --4. Worlc done at Kew as one of the Observatories of the Meteorological

Committee. This consists in keeping the Barograph, Thermograph, and
Anemograph furnished by the Meteorological Committee in constant opera-
tion. The Barograph is erected in the room which contains the Magneto-
graphs, and which has a very small daily range of temperature. The outer

part of the Thermograph is attached to the north side of the Observatory,
towards the west, while the Anemograph has been erected above the centre
of the dome, so as not to interfere with the Photoheliograph.

   For the first two of these instriiments traces in duplicate are obtained, one

set being sent to the Meteorological Office, and one retained at Kew ; as

regards the Anemograph, the original records are sent, while a copy of these

on tracing-paper is retained.

  The tabulations from the curves of the Kew instruments, and the exami-
nation of the results forwarded to Kew from the outlying Observatories, so

far as this last is not personally done by Mr. Stewart, are performed in a

very satisfactory manner by Messrs. Whipple, Baker, and Page.

   Mr. Steventon, a nephew of Captain Toynbee, of the Meteorological Ofiice,

has been in attendance at the Observatory for instruction for about twelve

months, and latterly has given much assistance in the meteorological de-
partment of the Observatory, with the details of which he is now fully con-

versant.

                              PRESIDENT.

My Loeds, Ladies, and Gentlesiek,

Thirty years will to-morrow have elapsed since I first attended a ITeeting

of the British Association ; it was the one which opened at Newcastle on the

20th of August, 1838. On that occasion, the Council of the Association

resolved to recommend to Her Majesty's Government the despatch of an

expedition to the Antarctic regions, under the command of Captain James

lloss ; and it was from Newcastle that I wrote to my friends announcing my

resolve to accompany it, in whatever capacity I could obtain a situation

myamongst its officers. It was thus that  scientific career was first shaped

and it is to this expedition, which was one of the very earliest results of the

labours of the British Association, that I am indebted for the honour you

have conferred upon me, in placing me in your President's chair.

If I now look back with pride to those immediately following years, when

I had a share, however small, in the discovery of the Antarctic Continent,

the Southern Magnetic Pole, the Polar Barrier, and the Ice-clad Volcanos

of Victoria Land, I do so also with otlier and far different feelings. Thirty

years, as statisticians tell us, represent the average duration of human life

I need not say, that, as measured by the records of the British Association,

a human lifetime is far shorter than this ; for of the fourteen officers who

presided over us in 1838, but two remain, youi- former President and devoted

adherent for thirty-five years, Sir Roderick Murchison, who delivered the

opening address on that occasion, and whose health, I regret to add, prevents
his attendance at this Meeting ; and your faithful and evergreen Secretary,
Professor Phillips, upon whose presence here I congratulate both you and

him.

Again, looking back beyond thirty years ago in the pages of youi- Records,

I find those to have been halcyon years for Presidents, when the preparation

and delivery of the Addresses devolved upon the Treasurer, Secretary, or

other officer than the President ; and that in fact Presidential Addresses

date from the first Meeting after that at Newcastle. Of late years these

Addresses have been regarded, if not as the whole duty of the President,

mycertainly as his highest ; for your sakes, as well as for  own, I wish this

were not so ; both because there are amongst youi' ofiicers so many men far

more competent than I am, and because I believe that the responsibility

which the preparation of these Addresses entails, disadvantageously hmits

yom- choice of Presidents. The impression is very prevalent that the Address

should either be a scientific foio- de force, philosophical and popular, or a

resume of the progress of one or more important branches of science ; and

this view of the duty has greatly embarrassed me, inasmuch as I am unable
                          ADDRESS.                    lix

to fulfil either of these requirements. On various occasions during the last

myhalf year I have essayed to fulfil the wishes of    botanical friends, that I

should either discuss the phenomena of the Vegetable kingdom in their

relation to collateral sciences, or sketch the rise and progress of Scientific

Botany during the present century, or a portion of it ; but every such essay

has been qiiickly frustrated by the pressure of official duties. Such themes

require much research, much thought, and, above all, some continuous leisure,
during which the whole mind may be concentrated on the method of treat-

ment, as well as on the material to be treated 'of; and this leisure was

incompatible with the discharge of my duties as administrator of a large

public department, entailing a ceaseless correspondence with the Government

offices, and with Botanical establishments aU over the globe. And I do not

ask your indulgence for myself alone, for there are at this Meeting official

men ot" scientific attainments, who have accepted the Presidentships of Sections,

but who, on leaving their posts to do your bidding, drag a lengthening chain

of correspondence after them, and sacrifice no short portion of those brief

holidays which are allowed to j^blic officers. After all, it is deeds, not

words, that we want from them ; and I am proud to find oiu" Sections pro-
sided over by men who have won their spurs in theii" respective sciences, and

who will wear them in the chairs they occupy, and use them, too, if needs

must.

  For my own part I propose to offer you some remarks upon several matters

to which the attention of your Committee was directed when at Dundee, and

then upon some of the great advances that have been made in Botany during

the last few years ; this wUl infallibly drag me into Darwinism : after which

I shall allude to some matters connected with that dawning science, the

Early History of Mankind, a theme which wiU be a distinguishing collateral

feature of the Norwich Association. If in all this I disappoint you, it will be

my solace to hope that I may thereby break the fall of some future President,

who, like myself, may have the will, but not the time, adequately to meet

your great expectations.

Before commencing, however, I must advert to a circumstance which

cannot but be uppermost in the minds of all habitual attendants at these

annual gatherings ; it is, that but for a severe accident there would have

been present here to-night the oldest surviving, and indeed the first but two

myof the Presidents of the British Association :      geological friends will

understand to whom I aUude, as that Eock of Science in whom age and the

heat and shocks of Scientific Controversy have wrought no metamorphosis,

--and developed no cleavage planes a man of whom both Norwich and the
--Association are proud your Cauon, our father, Sedgwick.

  My first duty as President is the pleasant one of introducing to you the

members of the International Congress of Pre-historie Archaeology, who, under

the Presidency of Sii- John Lubbock, himself a master of this branch of

knowledge, open their third session to-morrow in this citj'. The researches

which specially occupy the attention of the Congress arc perhaps the most

fascinating that ever engaged the faculties of man ; and pnrsued as they now

are in a scientific spirit, and in due subjection to scientific methods, they will

command all the sympathy, and their meetings wiU receive all the support

that my fellow members of the British Association can afford to them. And

there is one way in particular by which we can show our goodwill and give

our support, so simple that I hope no one will neglect it ; and that is that we

shall all call at their official residence at the Free Library, inscribe our names

in their books, and obtain cards for their meetings.
--IX REPORT 1868.

   The next subject whicli I have to briug officially before you ^yill interest
the members of the Congress no less than ourselves, and relates to the action
of your Committee appointed last year to represent to the Secretary of
State for India " the great and urgent importance of adopting active measures
to obtain reports on the physical form, manners, and customs of the indige-
nous populations of India, and especially of those tribes which are still in the
habit of erecting Megalithic monuments."

   Upon consideration the Committee decided that it would be better in the

first instance, to direct the attention of the Secretary of State to the last-

mentioned subject only, both because the whole inquiry was so vast, and

because systematic efforts are now being made by the Indian Government to

obtain photographs and histoi'ies of the native Indian tribes. Their efforts
are, as regards the photographs obtained in India, eminently successful, which
renders it all the more disappointing that the descriptive matter appended to
them in this country, and which is happily anonymous, is most fliscreditablo
to the authority under which it Ls issued*.

   It will, no doubt, surprise many here to be told that there exists within
300 miles of the British capital of India, a tribe of semi-savages who

habitually erect dolmens, menhirs, cysts, and cromlechs, almost as gigantic
in their projiortions as the so-called Druidical remains of \Yestern Europe,
which they greatlj' resemble in appearance and construction ; and what is
stiU more curious, though described and figured nearly a quarter of a century
ago by Col. Yule, the eminent oriental geographer, except by Sir John Lub-
bock these erections are scarcely alluded to in the modern literature of
prehistoric monuments. In the Bengal Asiatic Journal for 1844, you wiU
find Col. Yule's description of the Khasia people of East Bengal ; an Indo-

Chinese race, who keep cattle but drink no milk, estimate distances traversed
by the mouthfuls of pawn chewed en route, and amongst whom the marriage
tie is so loose that the son commonly forgets his father, while the sister's son
inherits property and rank. Dr. Thomson and I dwelt for some months
amongst the Khasia people, now eighteen years ago, and found Col. Yule's
account to be correct in aU particulars. The undulatory eminences of the

country, some 4r-6000 feet above the level of the sea, are dotted with groups
of huge unpolished square pillars, and tabular slabs supported on three or four

rude piers.

   In one spot, buried in a sacred grove, we found a nearly complete circle
of menhirs, the tallest of which was thirty feet out of the ground, six feet
broad, and two feet eight inches thick ; and in front of each was a dolmen or

cromlech of proportionately gigantic pieces of rock.

   The largest slab hitherto measured is thirty-two feet high, fifteen feet

broad, and two feet thick. Several that we saw had been very recently
erected, and wc were informed that every year some are put up, but not during
the rainy season, which we spent in the country. The method of separating

the blocks is by cutting grooves, along which fires are lighted, and into which,

when heated, cold water is run, which causes the rock to split along the

groove ; the lever and rope are the only mechanical aids used in transporting

--and erecting the blocks. The objects of their erection are various sejiulture,

marking spots where public events had occurred, &c. It is a curious fact
that the Khasian word for a stone, "Mau," as commonly occurs in the names
of their villages and places, as that of Man, Maen, and Men, does in those of

   * I am informed that measures have been taken to repair this, and that Col. Meadows
Taylor, than whom a more competent man could not be found, has been appointed to

undertake the literary and scientific portions in futiu-e.

ever, the country has been more opened up, and the establishment of a Bri-

tish cantonment amongst them renders it all the more important that the

inquiry into their origin, language, beliefs, customs, &c. should be followed

up without delay. This will now be done, thanks to your representations

The Council of the Association, upon the recommendation of the Biological

Section,^ appointed a committee to report upon the subject of the Government

of the IS'atural-History Collections of the British Museum ; which resulted in

a deputation which represented to the Prime Minister in the name of the

Council, that it was desirable that these collections should be placed under

the control of a single officer, who should be directly responsible to a Minister

of the Crown                                           and that this                                        opinion was     shared                                                                                    by an  overwhelming  majo-

reason why the IN'ational Collections of Natural History should be administered

in a way different from that which was found apphcable to the Eoyal Gar-

dens and Botanical Collections at Kew, the Museum of Practical Geology, and

the Eoyal Observatory at Greenwich*, and that the interposition of any Board

or Committee between the Superintendent of the Collections and the Govern-
ment must interfere with the responsibility of the Superintendent and the

efficient control of the Minister.

It was not the first time that this subject had been brought before Her

Majesty's                                  Government                                                       since ten  years previously                                                                               a few Naturalists,  consisting

reason to alter the views therein expressed on any vital point.

Of the objections to the present system of government by Trustees, some of

the most grave have been stated by Mr. Andrew Murray in a communication f

* Since writing the above, I have been reminded of the constitution of the Board of
Visitors to the Royal Observatory by tlie Astronomer Eoyal, who has favoured me with
copies of the Regulations of the Royal Observatory (1852), and of his Report (for 1808^
to the Board of Visitors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  '

   From a perusal of this document, I find that the Board of Visitors is authorized to
direct the Astronomer Royal to make such observations as the Board shaU think proper ·

to mspeet the instruments, and to communicate with the Lords of the Admiralty upon tlie
arrangements for keeping them in order ; to make any suggestions to tlie Lords of the
Admiralty touching the Observatory, and to require of the Astronomer Royal every three
months, a copy of the observations made, with a view to printing them. I also gather
tliat, lor the efficient administration of all the duties of the Observatory, the Astronomer
Koyal IS solely responsible to the Lords of the Admiralty.

made to the Biological Section at Dundee ; to which I would only add,
that though the Zoological Collections are the finest in the world, and
the Geological and Palreontological of prodigious extent and value, there are
of the forty-five Trustees, only three who have any special knowledge what-

soever of the branches of science these collections illustrate ; that since Sir
Joseph Banks's death, nearly half a centuiy ago, no Botanist has ever been

appointed a Trustee, though the Banksian Herbarium and Botanical Library,
then amongst the most valuable in Europe, were left by their owner to the
nation ; and, in fine, that the interests of Botany have by the Trustees been

greatly neglected.

   Much as has been written npon the uses of museums, I believe that the

subject is still far from being exhausted, for in the present state of education

in this country, these appear to me to afl'ord the only means of efficiently

teaching to schools the elements of Zoology and Physiology. .1 say in the

present state of education, because I believe it will be many years before
we have schoolmasters and mistresses trained to teach these subjects, and
many more years before either provincial or private schools will be sup-

plied with such illustrative specimens as are essential for the teacher's

 purposes.

    Confining myself to the consideration of provincial and local museums, and
their requirements for educational purposes, each should contain a connected
series of specimens illustrating the principal and some of the lesser divisions
 of the Animal and Vegetable Kingdoms, so disposed in weU-lighted cases,
 that an inquiring observer might learn therefrom the principles upon which
 animals and plants are classified, the relations of their organs to one another
 and to those of their aUies, the functions of those organs, and other matters
 relating to their habits, uses, and place in the economy of nature. Such an

arrangement has not been carried out in any museum Imown to me, though
 partially attained in that at Ipswich ; it requires some space, many pictorial

 illustrations, magnified views of the smaller oi'gans and their structure, and
 copious legible descriptive labels, and it should not contain a single specimen

 more than is wanted. The other requirements of a provincial museum

 are, complete collections of the plants and animals of the province, which
 should be kept entirely apart from the instructional series, and from every-

 thing else.

    The Curator of the Museum should be able to give elementary demonstra-
 tions (not lectures, and quite apart from any powers of lecturing that he may

 possess) upon this classified series, to schools and others, for which a fee

 should be charged, which should go to the support of the Institution. And
 the museum might be available (under similar conditions of payment) for

 lectures and other demonstrations.
     Did such an illustrated typical collection exist in your rich and weU-

 arranged Norwich Museum, I am sure that there is not an intelligent school-
 master in the city who would not see that his school profited by the demon-
 strator's offices, nor a parent who would grudge the trifling fee.

    You boast of a superb collection of Birds of Prey ; how much would the

 value of this be enhanced, Avere it accompanied by such an illustration of tlio
 nature, habits, and affinities of the Raptores, as might well be obtained by

 an exhibition of the skeleton and dissected organs of one Hawk and one Owl,

  so laid out and ticketed that a schoolboy should see the structure of their

--beak, feet, wings, feathers, bones, and internal organs should see why it is

 that Hawks and Owls are preeminent amongst birds for powers of sight and

  of flight ; for cii'cling and for swooping ; for rapacity, voracity, and tenacity

--of life, should see, iu short, the affinities and special attributes of Birds of

Prey*.

  A series of illustrated typical specimens, occupying some 500 to 800 feet of

wall space, would give at a glance a connected and intelligible elementary
view of the classification and structure of the whole animal kiagdom ; it would

stand in the same relation to a complete Museum and Systema Natm-se as a
chart on which the principal cities and coast-lines are clearly laid down does
to a map crowded with uudistinguishable details.

   Excellent manuals of many branches of Zoology are now published which

are invaluable to the advanced student and demonstrator, but from which

the schoolboy recoils, who nevertheless would not refuse to accept objects and

pictures as memory's pegs, on which to hang ideas, facts, and hard names.

To schoolboys skeletons have often a strange fascination, and upon the struc-
ture of these the classification of the vertebrata much depends. ^Tiat boy,

who had ever been shown their skulls, would caU a Seal or Porpoise a fish,
or believe that a hedgehog could milk cows ! as I am told many boys in

Norfolk and Suffolk (as elsewhere) do implicitly beheve.

   Much of the utility of Museums depends on two conditions often strangely

overlooked, viz. their situation, and their lighting and interior arrangements.

The provincial Museum is too often huddled away, almost out of sight, in a

dark, crowded, and dirty thoroughfare, where it pays dear for ground-rent,

rates and taxes, and cannot be extended ; the object, apparently, being to

catch country people on market days. Such localities are frequented by

the town's people only when on business, and when they consequently

have no time for sight-seeing. In the evening, or- on holidays, when they
could visit the Museum, they naturally prefer the outskii'ts of the town to

its centre.

   Hence, too, the country gentry scarcely know of the existence of the
Museum; and I never remember to have heard of a provincial Museum that

was frequented by schools. I do not believe that this arises from indifference

to knowledge on the part of the upper classes or of teachers, btit to the gene-

rally uninstructive nature of the contents of these Museums, and their unin-

viting exterior and interior. There are plenty of visitors of all classes to the

Museums at Kew, despite the counter attractions of the gardens ; and I know
no more pleasing sight than these present on Sunday and Monday after-
noons, when crowded by intelligent visitors, directing their children's atten-

tion to the ticketed objects in the cases.

   The Museum should be in an open grassed square or park, planted with

trees, in the town, or its outskirts ; a main object being to secure cleanliness,

Nowa cheerful aspect, and space for extension.  vegetation is the best inter-

ceptor of dust, which is injurious to the specimens as well as unsightly, whilst

a cheerful aspect and grass and trees will attract visitors, and especially
families and schools.

   If the external accessories of provincial Museums are bad, the internal
arrangements are often worse ; the rooms are usually lighted by windows on
one side only, so that the cases between the windows are dark, and those op-
posite the windows reflect the light when viewed obliquely, whUst the visitor
standing ia front is in his own light. For provincial Museums, Avhere space

is an object, there is no better plan than rectangular long rooms, with opposite
windows on each side, and buttress cases projecting into the room between

best attained in schools by Professor Henslow's method of teaching Botany.

each pair of windows. Tliis arrangement combines economy of space with

perfect illumination, and affords facilities for classification*.

In respect of its Natural-History Collections, the jiosition of the British

Museum appears to me disadvantageous ; it is surrounded by miles of streets,

including some of the principal Metropolitan thoroughfares, which pour

clouds of dust, and the products of coal-combustion into its area day and

night ; and I know few more disappointing sights, to me, than its badly
lighted interior presents on a hot and crowded public hoHday, when whole

famines from London and its outskirts flock to the building. Then young and

old may be seen gasping for fresh air in its galleries, with no alternative but

Howthe hotter and dustier streets to resort to.    different it would be were

these Collections removed to the town ward end of one of the great parks

where spacious and well-lighted galleries could be built, amongst ti'ees, grass,

and fountains ; and where whole families need not be cooped up for the day

in the building, but avail themselves of the fresh air and its accessories at the

same time as they profit by the Museum.

Norwich, I hear with surprise, has no Public Park worthy of the name.

That she may soon have one should be the endeavour of every citizen, and to

have a good instructional series added to your admirable Museum, and this

transferred to the Park, should be the aspiration of all who are interested in

the education and moral well-being of their townsmen.

  My remarks on the British Museum convey no reflection on the able ofHcers

who have, in so short a time, formed this wonderful Collection. Lawrence, in

his Lectures delivered in iSlS, congratulates his audience on the formation

of a Zoological Collection having just been determined upon; in 1838, when

I first knew the Museum, in Old Montague House, I was told it ranked about

--the sixth in Europe now, and for some years past, it has been considered to

be the finest in the world. This is due to the energy and ability of the

Keepers and Curators ; and in mentioning them, I would wish to pay a passing-

tribute to the merits of the venerable Dr. Gray, who has devoted his life to

the development of the Zoological Department, with a singleness of purpose,

liberality, and zeal that are bej'ond all praise.

At the time when Old Montague House contained the National Collections,

there was but one Museum in the Metropolis in which the Naturalist could

study to much purpose ; this was the Hunterian (belonging to the Eoyal

College of Surgeons), then under the superintendence of the late Mr. Clift

and of Professor Owen, the friend of my early youth, when preparing myself

to accompany the Antarctic Expedition, and who instructed me in the use of

that now unrivalled series of Catalogues, that owes so much to himself.

Prom the Museum of the Koyal College of Surgeons, the national and pro-

vincial Museums of England have much to learn and to copy ; and, thanks

to the wisdom and munificence of the Council of the CoUege, and to the zeal

* Upon this plan the large Museum in Kew is built, where the three principal rooms

are 70 ft. long by 45 ft. wide, and each accommodates 1000 square feet of admirably lighted

cases, 600 or 700 feet of wall-room for pictures and for portraits of naturalists, besides

Atwo fireplaces, four entrances, and a well-staircase, 11 feet square.  circular building,

with cases radiating from the wall between the windows, would probably be the best ar-

Arangement of all.  light spiral staircase in the centre would lead to the upper stories.

Two or more of the bays might be converted into private rooms, without disturbing the

symmetry of the interior or intercepting the lighting of the cases. The proportions of the

basement and first floor might be such as to admit of additional stories being added, and

the roof might be so constructed as to be removable without difficulty, when an additional

story was reqvdred ; furthermore, rectangular galleries might be built, radiating from the

central building, and lighted by opposite windows, with buttress cases between each pair

of windows.

and ability of the present Conservator, Mr, Flower, it retains the position it

attained thirty years ago, of being the best and richest institution of the kind

in Europe.

  In my own special science, the greatest advances that have been made

during the last ten years have been in the departments of Fossil Botany and

Vegetable Physiology.

In the past history of the globe two epochs stand prominently forward

(the Carboniferous and the Miocene) for the abundant materials they afford,

and the light they consequently throw on the early conditions of the vege-

table kingdom. Why plants should have been so much more abundantly

preserved during these than during some of the intervening or earlier epochs,

we do not rightly know ; but the comparative poverty of the floras of these

latter is amongst the strongest evidences of the imperfection of the geological

record.

   Our knowledge of coal plants, which, since the days of Sternberg, Brong-
niart, and Lindley and Hutton, has been chiefly advanced by Goeppert and

Unger on the Continent, and by Dawson in Canada, has of late received

very important accessions through the untiring energy of Mr. Binney, of

Manchester, who has devoted nearly thirty years to the search for those

rarely found specimens which exhibit the internal structure of the plant.

His elaborate descriptions of the most abundant, and, before his researches,

the least understood plant of the coal-measures, Galamites, have just appeared

in the memoirs of the Palseontographical Society ; and some of Mr. Binney's

materials having also formed the subject of a very recent and valuable paper

by Mr. Carruthers, of the British Museum, I may quote their joint results as
one. These show that Calamites is an actual member of the existing family

of EquisetaceEe, which contained previously but one geniis, that of the com-

mon mare's tails of our river-banks and woods ; as also, that nearly a dozen
other genera of coal-measure plants may be referred to it. This afiinity of
Calamites had, indeed, been guessed at before, but the genera now referred

to it, having been founded on mere fragments, were always doubtful ; but
the value of these positive identifications is none the less on this account.

It may hereafter prove of some significance, that these Calamites, which, in

the coal epoch, assumed gigantic proportions, and presented multitudinous

forms and very varied organs of growth, are now represented by but one

genus, differing most remarkably from its prototype in size, and in the sim-

plicity and uniformity of its vegetable organs.

Passing to the Tertiary Flora, the labours of Count Saporta in France, of

Gaudin and Strozzi, and of Massolonghi in Italy, of Lesquereus in America,

and above all, of Heer in Switzerland, have within the last ten years accu-

mulated a vast mimber of species of fossil plants ; and if the determinations

of the affinities of the majority are to be depended on, they prove the per-

sistence, throughout the Tertiary strata, of many existing families and genera,
and the rarity of others than these. Here, however, much value cannot bo

attached to negative evidence. Almost the only available materials for de-

termining the affinities of the vast majority of these Tertiary plants are their

mutilated leaves, and, unlike the bones of vertebrate animals and the shells

of MoUusks, the leaves of individual plants are extremely variable in all their

characters. Furthermore, the leaves of plants of different natural families,

and of different countries, mimic one another to such a degree that, in the

case of recent plants, every botanist regards these organs as most treacherous

guides to affinity. Of the structural characters, which are drawn from the

internal organs of plants, and especially from their fruits, seeds, and flowers,

few traces are to be found in fossils ; and it is from these exclusively that

the position of a recent plant iu the vegetable kingdom can be certified. An

instructive instance of over-reliance on leaves, and perhaps too on precon-

ceived ideas, happened not long ago to a Paleontologist of such distinguished

merit that his reputation cannot suffer from an allusion to it. In the course

of his labours upon some imperfect specimens from a most interesting locality,

he referred three associated impressions of fossil leaves to three genera,

belonging to as many different families of plants ; and was thus helped to

what would have been some important conclusions as to the vegetation of the

Aperiod in which they were deposited.  subsequent observer, who is a

botanist but not a pateontologist, declares the leaves thus referred to three

genera to be the three leaflets of the leaf of one plant, and this the common

blackberry, which still grows on the spot. Which of the two is right, I do

not say ; the fact shows to what opposite conclusions different observei'S of

the same fossil materials may be led.

 -- --In this most uni'eliable of sciences Fossil Botany we do but grope in the

dark ; of the thousands of objects we stumble against, we here and there
recognize a likeness to what we have elsewhere known, and rely on external

similitude for a helping hand to its aflSnities ; of the great majority of speci-

mens we know nothing for certain, and of no small proportion Ave are utterly

ignorant. If, however, much is uncertain, all is not so, and the science has

of late made sure and steady progress, and developed really grand results.

Heer's labours on the Miocene and Pliocene floras especially, are of the

highest value and interest ; his conclusions regarding the flora of the Bovey

Tracey Coal-beds (for the jjublication of which, in a form worthy of their

value and of their author's merit, we are indebted to the wise liberality of

Miss Burdett Coutts) are founded on a sufficient number of absolute deter-

minations ; and his more recent ' Flora Fossilis Arctica ' threatens to create a
revolution in Tertiary Geology. In this latter work Professor Heer shows,

on apparently unassailable evidence, that forests of Austrian, American, and

Asiatic trees flourished during the Miocene period in Iceland, Arctic Greenland,

Spitzbergen, and the Polar American Islands, in latitudes where such trees

could not now exist under any conceivable conditions or positions of land,

sea, or ice ; leaving little doubt that an arboreous vegetation once ex-

tended to the Pole itself. Discoveries such as these appear at first actually

to retard the progress of science, by coufoimding all previous geological

reasoning as to the climate and condition of the globe during the Tertiary epoch.

I have said that the greatest botanical discoveries made during the last ten

years have been physiological ; and I here alluded especially to the series of

papers on the Fertilization of Plants which we owe to Mr, Darwin. You

are aware that this distinguished naturalist, after accumulating stores of

facts in geology and zoology during his circumnavigation of the globe with

Captain Fitzroy, espoused the doctrine of the continuous evolution of life,

and by applying to it the principles of Natural Selection, evolved his theory

of the Origin of Species. Instead of publishing these views as soon as con-

ceived, he devoted twenty more years to further observation, study, and ex-

periment, with the view of maturing or subverting them. Amongst the

subjects requiring elucidation or verification, were many that appertained to

Botany, but which had been overlooked or misunderstood by botanical

writers ; and these he set himself to examine rigorously.

The first fruit of his labours was his volume on the 'Fertilization of

Orchids,' undertaken to show that the same plant is never continuously

fertilized by its own pollen, and that there are special provisions to favour'
                                                                              ;;

the crossing of individuals. As his study of the British species advanced, he
became so interested in the number, variety, and complexity of the con-
trivances he met with, that he extended his survey to the whole family
and the result is a work, of which it is not too much to say that it has
thrown more light upon the structure and functions of the floral organs of
this immense and anomalous family of plants, than had been shed by the
labours of all previous botanical writers. It has further opened up entirely
new fields of research, and discovered new and important principles that

apply to the whole vegetable kingdom.
   This was followed by his paper on the well-known forms of the Primrose

and Cowslip*, popularly known as the pin-eyed and thrum-eyed: these

forms he showed to be sexual and complementary, their diverse functions
being to secure, by their mutual action, full fertilization, which he proved

could only take place through insect agency. In this paper he established

the existence of homomorjihic or legitimate, and heteromorphic or illegitimate

unions amongst plants, and detailed some curious observations on the struc-
ture of the pollen. The results of this, perhaps more than any other of
Mr. Darwin's papers, took botanists by siu^prise, the plants being so familiar,

their two forms of flower so well known to every intelligent observer, and his

explanation so simple. For my own part I felt that my botanical knowledge
of these homely plants had been but little deeper than Peter Bell's, to whom

A primrose by the river's brim
A yellow primrose was to him,

And it was nothing more.

Analogous observations on the dimorphism of flax and its allies f formed a
subsequent paper; during the course of which observations he made the

wonderful discovery that, in the common flax, the pollen of cue form of

flower is absolutely impotent when apphed to its own stigma, but invariably

potent when applied to the stigma of the other form of flower; yet the

pollens and stigmas of the two kinds are utterly undistinguishable under the

highest powers of the microscope.

   His third investigation was a very long and laborious one on the Common

Loosestrife J {Lyihrum salicaria), which he showed to be trimorphic ; this one
species having three kinds of flowers, all annually abundantly produced, and

as different as if they belonged to ditferent species ; each flower has, further,

Wethree kinds of stamens, differing in form and function.  have in this

plant, then, six kinds of pollen, of which five at least are essential to com-

plete fertility, and three distinct forms of style. To prove these various

differences, and that the co-adaptation of aU these stamens and pistils was

essential to complete fertility, Mr. Darwin had to institute eighteen sets of

observations, each consisting of twelve experiments, 216 in all. Of the

labour, care, and delicacy required to guard such experiments against the

possibility of error, those alone can tell who experimentally know how

difficult it is to hybridize a large-flowered plant of simple form and structure.

The results in this case, and in those of a number of allied plants experi-

mented on at the same time, are such as the authoi"'s sagacity had predicted

the rationale of the whole was demonstrated, and he finally showed, not only

how nature might operate in bringing these complicated modifications into

harmonious operation, but how through insect agency she does do this, and
also why she does it.

Ixviii  --REPORT 1868.

   It is impossible even to enumerate here the many important generaliza-
tions that have followed from these and other papers of Mr. Darwin on the

fertilization of plants ; some that appear to be commonplace at first sight are

really the most subtle, and like many other apparent commonplaces, are

what, somehow, never occur to commonplace minds : as, for instance, that
all plants with conspicuously coloured flowers or powerful odours or honeyed
secretions are fertilized by insects; all with inconspicuous flowers, and

especially such as have pendulous anthers or incoherent pollen, are fertilized

by the wind : whence he infers that, before honey-feeding insects existed,
the vegetation of our globe could not have been ornamented with bright-
coloured flowers, but consisted of such plants as pines, oaks, grasses, nettles, &c.

    The only other botanical paper of Mr. Darwin to which I can especially
allude, is that " On the Habits and Movements of Climbing Plants" *, which
is a most elaborate investigation into the structure, modification, and func-
tions of the various organs by which plants climb, twine, and attach them-
selves to foreign objects. In this he reviews every family in the vegetable
kingdom, and every organ used by any plant for the above purposes. The
result places the whole subject in a totally new light. The guesses, crude
 observations, and abortive experiments that had disfigured the writings of
 previoiis observers are swept away; organs, structures, and functions, of
Avhich botanists had no previous knowledge, are revealed to them ; and the
whole investigation is made as clear as it is interesting and instructive.

    The value of these discoveries, which add whole chapters to the principles
 of botany, is not theoretical only : already the horticulturist and agri-
 culturist have begun to ponder over them, and to recognize in the failure
of certain crops, the operation of laws that Mr. Darwin first laid down. What
 Paraday's discoveries are to telegraphy, Mr. Darwin's will assui-edly prove

 to rural economy, in its widest sense and most extended application.
    Another instance of successful experiment in Physiological Botany is Mr.

 Herbert Spencer's observations on the circulation of the sap and the forma-
tion of wood in plants f. As is well known, the tissues of herbs, shrubs,
 and trees, from the tips of their roots to those of their petals and pistils, are
 permeated by tubular vessels. The functions of these have been hotly dis-
puted, some physiologists affirming that they convey air, others fluids, others
gases, and still others assigning to them far-fetched uses, of a wholly

different natiu-e. By a series of admirably contrived and conducted experi-
ments, Mr. Spencer has not only shown that these vessels are charged at

 certain seasons of the year with fluid, but that they are intimately connected

with the formation of wood. He further investigates the nature of the
special tissues concerned in this operation, and shows not merely how they
may act, but to a great extent how they do act. As this paper will, I

believe, be especially alluded to by the President of the Biological Section, I

need dwell no further on it here, than to quote it as an example of what may

be done by an acute observer and experimentalist, versed in Physics and
 Chemistry, but above all, thoroughly instructed in scientiflc methods.

    Mr. Darwin's recent volumes " On Animals and Plants under Domestica-

 tion," contain a harvest of data, observations, and experiments, such as
 assuredly no one but himself could have gathered. It is hard to say whether

this book is most remarkable for the number and value of the new facts it

 discloses, or for its array of small forgotten or overlooked observations,

neglected by some naturalists, and discarded by otters, wbich, under his

mind and eye, prove to be of first-rate scientific importance. An eminent

surgeon and physiologist (Mr. James Paget) remarked to me, a 'pro])os of these
volumes, that they exemplify in a most remarkable manner that power of

utilizing the waste materials of other men's laboratories which is a very

characteristic feature of their author. As one of those pieces justljicatives of

his previous work, ' The Origin of Species,' which have been waited for so

long and impatiently, these volumes will probably have more than their due

influence                                   for the serried ranks of facts in support of his theories which they
                                         ;

present, may weU awe many a timid naturalist into swallowing more obnoxious

doctrines than that of natural selection.

   It is in this work that Mr. Darwin expounds his new hypothesis of Pan-
genesis, which certainly correlates, and may prove to contain the rationale of
aU the phenomena of reproduction and of inheritance. You are aware that

every plant or animal commences its more or less independent life as a single

cell, from which is developed an organism more or less closely similar to
its parent. One of the most striking examples I can think of is aff"ordcd by

a species of Begonia, the stalks, leaves, and other parts of which are super-

ficially studded with loosely attached cellular bodies. Any one of those

bodies, if placed under favourable conditions, will produce a perfect plant,

similar to its parent. You may say that these bodies have inherited the

potentiality to do so ; but this is not all, for every plant thus produced, in like

manner developes on its stalks leaves and myriads of similar bodies, endowed
with the same property of becoming new plants, and so on, apparently

interminably. Therefore the original cell that left the grand parent, not only

carried with it this so-called potentiality, but multiplied it and distributed

it with undiminished power through the other cells of the plant produced

by itself, and so on, for countless generations. What is this potentiahty ?

and how is this power to reproduce thus propagated, so that an organism can,

by single cells, multiply itself so rapidly, and within very narrow limits, so

surely and so interminably ? Mr. Darwin suggests an explanation, by as-

suming that each cell or fragment of a plant (or animal) contains myriads

of atoms or gemmides, each of which gemmule he supposes to have been

thrown off from the separate cells of the mother-plant, the gemmules

having the power of multiplication, and of circulating throughout the plant

their future development he supposes to depend on their affinity for other

partially developed cells in due order of succession. Gemmules which do

not become developed, may, according to his hypothesis, be transmitted

through many succeeding generations, thus enabling us to understand

many remarkable cases of reversion or atavism. Hence the normal organs

of the body have not only the representative elements of which they consist

difi'used through all the other parts of the body, but the morbid states of

these, as hereditary diseases, malformations, &c., all actually circulate in the

body as morbid gemmides.

As with other hypotheses based on the assumed existence of structures and

elements that escape our senses, by reason of their minuteness or subtlety,

this of Pangenesis will approve itself to some minds and not to others. To

some these inconceivably minute circulating gemmules will be as apparent

to the mind's eye as the stars of which the Milky Way is composed ; others

will prefer embodying the idea in such a term as potentiality, a term which

conveys no definite impression whatever, and they will like it none the less

on this account.

Whatever be the scientific value of these gemmules, there is no question
--IXX REPORT 1868.

but that to Mr. Darwiu's eminciation of the doctrine of Pangenesis we owe it
that we have the clearest and most sj^stematic resume of the many wonderful
phenomena of reproduction and inheritance that has yet appeared ; and

against the giiarded entertainment of the hypothesis, or speculation if you
will, as a means of correlating these phenomena, nothing can be urged in the
present state of science. The President of the Linneau Society, a proverbially

--cautious naturahst, thus well expresses his own ideas of Pangenesis : " If,"

he says, " we take into consideration how familiar mathematical signs and
symbols make us with numbers and combinations, the actual realization of
which is beyond all human capacity, how inconceivably minute must be

those emanations which most powerfully affect our sense of smell and our

constitutions, and if, discarding all preventions, we follow llr. Darwin, step
by step, applying his suppositions to the facts set before us, we must, I think,
admit that they may explain some, and are not incompatible with others ; and
it appears to me that Pangenesis will be admitted by many as a provisional
hypothesis, to be further tested and to be discarded only when a more

plausible one shall be brought forward."

    Ten years have elapsed since the publication of ' The Origin of Species by
Natural Selection,' and it is therefore not too early now to ask what
progress that bold theory has made in scientific estimation. The most widely
circulated of all the journals that give science a prominent place on their title-
pages, the · Athenteum,' has very recently told to every country where the
English language is read, that Mr. Darwin's theory is a thing of the past,
that Natural Selection is rapidly declining in scientific favour, and that, as
regards the above two volumes on the variations of animals and plants under
domestication, they " contain nothing more in support of origin by selection,
than a more detailed reasseveration of his guesses founded on the so-called

variations of pigeons."

    Let us examine for ourselves into the truth of these inconsiderate state-
ments. Since the ' Origin ' appeared ten years ago, it has passed through
four English editions, two American, two German, two French, several
Russian, a Dutch, and an Italian; whilst of the work on Variation, which
first left the publisher's house not seven months ago, two English, a German,
Russian, American, and Itahan editions are already in circulation. So far
from Natural Selection being a thing of the past, it is an accepted doctrine
with almost every philosophical naturalist, including, it will always be under-

stood, a considerable proportion who are not prepared to admit that it ac-
counts for all Mr. Darwin assigns to it.

    Eeviews on ' The Origin of Species ' are stUl pouring in from the con-
tinent ; and Agassiz, in one of the adfkesses which he issued to his coUobora-
teurs on their late voyage to the Amazons, dii'ccts their attention to this
theory as a primary object of the expedition they were then undertaking.
I need only add, that of the many eminent naturalists who have accepted it,
not one has been known to abandon it ; that it gains adherents steadily ; and
that it is par excellence an avowed favourite -with, the rising schools of natui'a-
lists perhaps, indeed, too much so, for the yormg are apt to accept such

                        ;

theories as articles of faith, and the creed of the student is but too likely to

become the shibboleth of the future professor.

   The scientific writers who have publicly rejected one or both of the

theories of continuous evolution and of natural selection, take their stand

upon physical or metaphysical grounds, or both. Of those who rely on the

metaphysical, their arguments are usually strongly imbued with theological
prejudice and even odium, and as such are bejond the pale of scientific
                                                                    ;

criticism. Having myself been a student of Moral Philosophy in a northern

University, I   myentered on  scientific career  fuU  of  hopes  that metaphysics

would prove a useful mentor, if not a guide in science. I soon, however,

found that it availed me nothing, and I long ago ai-rived at the conclusion, so
well put by Agassiz, when he says, " we trust that the time is not distant

when it will be universally understood that the battle of the evidences wiU

have to be fought on the field of Physical Science, and not on that of Meta-

physical" *. Many of the metaphysicians' objections have been controverted

by that champion of N"atural Selection, Mr. Darwin's true knight, Alfred

Wallace, in his papers on '' Protection "f and " Creation by Law"j, &c., in
which the doctrines of " Continual Interference," the '' Theory of Beauty,"

and kindi'cd subjects, are discussed with admii-able sagacity, knowledge, and

skill. But of Mr. Wallace and his many contributions to i^hilosophical

biology, it is not easy to speak without enthusiasm ; for, putting aside their
great merits, he, throughout his writings, with a modesty as rare as I believe

it to be in him unconscious, forgets his own unquestioned claims to the

honour of having originated, independently of Mr. Dar-win, the theories

which he so ably defends.

   On the score of geology, the objectors chiefly rely on the assumed perfection
of the geological record; and since almost aU who believe in its imperfection,

and many of the other school, accept the theories both of evolution and natural

selection, wholly or in part, there is no doubt that Mr. Darwin claims the

great majority of geologists. Of these, one is in himself a host, the veteran

Sir Charles Lyell, who, after having de-\'oted whole chapters of the first edi-

tions of his ' Principles ' to establishing the doctrine of special creations,

abandons it in the 10th edition, and this, too, on the showing of a pupil ; for,

in the dedication of his earliest work, ' The Naturalist's Voyage,' to Sir C.

Lyell, Mr. Darwin states that the chief part of whatever merit he or his works

may possess, has been derived from studjing the ' Principles of Geology.' I

know no brighter example of heroism, of its kind, than this, of an author

thus abandoning, late in life, a theory which he had for forty years regarded

as one of the foundation stones of a work that had given him the highest
position attainable amongst contemporary scientific writers. Well may he be

proud of a superstructure, raised on the foundations of an insecure doctrine,

when he finds that he can underpin it and substitute a new foundation ; and

after aU is finished, survey his edifice, not only more secure, but more har-

monious in its proportions than it was before ; for assuredly the biological
chapters of the tenth edition of the ' Principles ' are more in harmony with

the doctrine of slow changes in the history of our planet, than were their

counterparts in the former editions.

   To the astronomers' objections to these theories I turn with difiidenco

they are strenuously urged in what is in my opinion the cleverest critique of

them that I have hitherto met with, and which appeared in the North British

Review. It is anonymous, I am wholly ignorant of its author, and I regret

to find that, in common with the few other really able hostile critiques, it

is disfigured by a dogmatism that contrasts unfavourably with Mr. Darwin's

considerate treatment of his opponents' methods and conclusions. The author

starts, if I read him aright, by professing his unfamiliarity with the truth

and extent of the facts upon which the theories of Evolution and Natural
Selection are founded, and goes on to say, that " the superstructure based on

them may be discussed apart from all doubts as to the fundamental facts."

The liberty thus to discuss no one may disunite or curtail, but the biologist

will ask, to what end can discussion lead ? Who woiild attach much weight

to the verdict of a judge passed on evidence of which he knew neither the

truth nor the extent ? As well might a boy guiltless of mathematics, set

himself to test the 47th proposition of the 1st book of Euclid, by constructing

paper squares corresponding to the sides of a right-angled triangle, then

cutting up the smaller squares, try to tit the pieces into the larger, and

failing to do this with exactitude, conclude of the problem, as the reviewer
does of the theory, that it is " an ingenious and plausible speculation, marking

at once the ignorance of the age and the ability of the philosopher."
   The most formidable argument urged by the reviewer is, that " the age of

the inhabited world as calculated by solar physics, is proved to have been

limited to a period whoUy inconsistent with Darwin's views." This would

be a valid objection if these views depended on those of one school of geolo-

gists ; and if the 500,000,000 years, which the reviewer adopts as the age of
the world, were, as an approximate estimate, accepted by either astronomers

or physicists. But, in the fh'st place, the reviewer assumes that the rate of

change in the condition of the earth's surface was vastly more rapid at the

beginnii]g than now, and has gradually slackened since ; but overlooks the

consequence, that according to all Mr. Darwin's principles the operations of

natural selection must in such cases have been formerly correspondingly more

rapid ; and in the second, are these speculations as to the solidity of the

earth's crust dating back only 500,000,000 years, to be depended upon ? In

his great work, the author* quoted for these numbers, gives as possible limits

20,000,000, or 400,000,000 years, whilst other philosophers assign to the

haijitable globe an age far exceeding the longest of these periods. Surely,

in estimates of such a nature as the above, which are calculated from data

themselves in a great degree hypothetical, there are no principles upon which

we are warranted in assuming the speculations of the astronomer to be more

worthy of confidence than those of the biologist.

  A former most distinguished President, and himself an astronomer, Pro-

fessor WhewcU, has said of astronomy that "it is not only the queen of
sciences, but the only perfect science, the only branch of human knowledge

in which we are able fully and clearly to interpret nature's oracles, so that

by that which we have tried we receive a prophecy of that which is un-
tried "f. Now, whilst fully admitting, and proudly as every scientific man

ought, that astronomy is the most certain in her methods and results of all

the sciences, that she has called forth some of the highest eftbrts of the intel-

lect, and that her results far transcend in grandeur those of any other science,

I think we may hesitate before we therefore admit her queenship, her per-

fection, or her sole claims to interpretation and to prophecy. Her methods
are those of the mathematicians ; she may call Geometry and Algebra her
handmaidens, but she is none the less their slave. No science is really per-

fect, certainly not that which lately erred nearly 4,000,000 miles in so fun-
damental a datum as the earth's distance from the sun. Have Faraday and

Yon Baer iutci-preted no oracles of nature fully and clearly ? Have Cuvier

and Dalton not prophesied, and been tnxe prophets ? Claims to queenship do

not accord with  the  spirit  of  science                                 rather would I liken the domain of
                                                                       ;

It remains to say a few words on some prospects which this Norwich Meet-

ing opens.

  A new science has dawned upon us, that of the Early History of Mankind.

Prehistoric archasology (including as it does the origin of language and of

art) has been the latest to rise of a series of luminaries that have dispelled

the mists of ages and replaced time-honoured traditions by scientific truths.

Astronomy, if not the queen, yet the earliest of sciences, first snatched the

torch from the hands of dogmatic teachers, tore up the letter and cherished
the spirit of the law. Geology next followed, but not till two centuries had

elapsed, nor indeed till this our day, in divesting religious teaching of many

cobwebs of scientific error. It has told us that animal and vegetable life

preceded the appearance of man on the globe, not by days but by myriads of
years ; and how late this knowledge came we may gather from the fact that

Lawrence in his previously quoted lectures *, delivered so late as 1818, says

of the extinct races of animals, " that their living existence has been sup-

posed, with considerable probability, to be of older date than the formation

of the human race."
   And, last of all, this new science proclaims man himself to have inhabited

this earth for perhaps many thousands of years before the historic period
a result little expected less than thirty years ago, when the Rev. W. V. Har-

court, in his address to the Association at Birmingham t, observed that
" Geology points to the conclusion, that the time during which mankind has

existed on the globe, cannot materially diff"cr from that assigned by Scrip-

ture," referring, I need not say, to the so-called Scripture chronology, which

has no warrant in the Old Testament, and which gives 587-1 years as the

age of the inhabited globe.

   Pre-historic Archaeology now off"ers to lead us where man has hitherto not

ventured to tread. Can we, whilst truthfully and fearlessly pursuing this

inquiry, separate its physical from its spiritual aspect ? will be the upper-

most thought in the minds of many here present. To separate them is, I
believe, indeed impossible, but to search out common truths that underlie

both is permitted to all. Mr. Disraeli J has well said of Truth, that it is the

sovereign passion of mankind. And it should be emphatically so in the minds

engaged in this search, where rehgion and science should speak peace to one

another, if they are to walk hand in hand in this our day and generation.

A great deal has of late been said and written about the respective attitudes

of Religion and Science ; and my predecessor, the Duke of Buccleuch, dwelt

on this in his address last year with great good sense and good taste, and

pointed out how much the progress of knowledge depended on this attitude

being mutually considerate and friendly. During the first decades of my

myscientific life, science was rarely, within            experience, heard of from the

pulpits of these islands : during the succeeding, when the influence of the

* Reliquiffi Diluvianse ' and the Bridgewater Treatises was still felt, I often
heard it named, and always welcomed. Now, and of late years, science is
more frequently named than ever, but too often with dislike or fear, rather

than with trust and welcome.

The Rev. Dr. Hanna, in an eloquent and candid contribution to the ' Con-

temporary Review "§, has adduced a long list of eminent clergymen of various

denominations, Avho have adorned science by their writings, and religion by

their lives. I do not ignore their contributions, still less do I overlook the

many brilliant examples of educated preachers who give to science the respect

due to it. But Dr. Hanna omits to observe that the majority of these

honoured contributors were not religious teachers in the ordinary sense of

the term ; nor does he tell us in what light many of their scientific writings

were regarded by a large body of thcii' brother clergj^men, those resident in

the country especially, from whom alone an overwhelming proportion of the

population ever hear the name of science.

To return, let each pursue the search for truth, the archaeologist into the

physical, the religious teacher into the spiritual history and condition of

mankind. It will be in vain that each regards the other's pursuit from afar,

and turning the object-glass of his mind's telescope to his eye, is content

when he sees how small the other looks.

To search out the whence and whither of his existence, is an unquench-

able instinct of the human mind ; to satisfy it, man in every age, and in

every country, has adopted creeds that embrace his past history and his

future being, and has eagerly accepted scientific truths that support the

creeds                              and but for this unquenchable instinct, I for one believe that neither
                                 ;

religion nor science would have advanced so far as they have into the hearts of

any people. Science has never in this search hindered the religious aspira-

tions of good and earnest men ; nor have pulpit cautions, which are too often

iU-disguised deterrents, ever turned inquiring minds from the revelations of

science.

  A sea of time spreads its waters between that period to which the earliest

traditions of our ancestors point, and that far earlier ]Dcriod, when man first
appeared upon the globe. For his track upon that sea man vainly questions
his spiritual teachers. Along its hither shore, if not across it, science now
offers to pilot him. Each fresh discovery concerning pre-historic man is as

a pier built on some rock its tide has exposed, and from these piers arches will
one day spring that will carry him further and further across its depths.

Science, it is true, may never sound the depths of that sea, may never buoy

its shallows, or span its narrowest creeks ; but she will still build on every

tide-washed rock, nor will she deem her mission fulfilled till she has sounded
its profoundest depths and reached its further shore, or proved the one to be
unfathomable and the other unattainable, ripon evidence not yet revealed to
mankind. And if in her track she bears in mind that it is a common object
of religion and of science to seek to understand the infancy of human ex-
istence, that the laws of mind are not yet relegated to the domain of
the teachers of physical science, and that the laws of matter are not within
the religious teacher's province, these may then work together in harmony
and with good wiU.

   But if they would thus work in harmony, both parties must beware how

they fence with that most dangerous of all two-edged weapons. Natural

Theology ; a science, falsely so called, when, not content with trustfully

accepting truths hostile to any presumptuous standard it may set up, it seeks

to weigh the infinite in the balance of the finite, and shifts its ground to

meet the requirements of every new fact that science establishes, and every
old error that science exposes. Thus pursued, Natural Theology is to the
scientific man a delusion, and to the religious man a snare, leading too often

to disordered intellects and to atheism.

  --One of our deepest thinkers *, Mr. Herbert Spencer, has said: " If reh-

gion and science are to be reconciled, the basis of the reconciliation must be
this deepest, widest, and most certain of facts, that the power which the
universe manifests to us is utterly inscrutable." The bonds that unite the

physical and spiritual history of mau, and the forces which manifest them-
selves in the alternate victories of mind and of matter over the actions of the

individual, are, of all the subjects that physics and psychology have revealed

to us, the most absorbing ; and are, perhaps, utterly inscrutable. In the
investigation of their phenomena is wrapped up that of the past and the

future, the whence and the whither, of his existence ; and after a knowledge

of these the human soul still yearns, and thus passionately cries, in the

words of a living poet :

In presenting the annual Report of the proceedings of the Lunar Com-

mittee, the usual course has been to specify the amount of work done

under the respective heads of Registration of Objects, the progress of the out-

line map, the results of observation, and a notice of any striking pheno-

menon that may have come under the cognizance of the Committee. Pre-

viously to entering upon the above-mentioned subjects, the Committee have

the pleasure to announce that, by the kindness of Edward Crossley, Esq.,
of Halifax, who has lent his equatorial of 7-3 in. aperture and 12 feet focal

length expressly for this work, they are in a better position not only for

more effectively constructing the map and compiling the catalogue, but also

for examining the observations which are transmitted to them from time to
time. With this view the telescope has been mounted at Walthamstow, and

has received several accessions to render it more suitable for the work. The

number of eyepieces capable of being used with it is twelve. Mr. Birt (who
is now engaged in examining in detail the areas already issued, in observing

Msuch spots as Linne, Alpetragius d, lY A" "^ IV ^9, and others that present

any remarkable phenomena, and also in cheeking zone and other observations)

reports that its performance is very satisfactory.

The acquisition of this instrument, the zones at present under systematic

observation, and particularly the increased number of observations (see post,
pp. 3 and 4) requisite to elucidate questions that may be raised relative to the
physical aspect and condition of the moon's surface induce the hope that more
observers will join in the work, especially gentlemen in possession of power-

ful optical means. The Committee are desirous that the basis of observation

of the physical aspect of the moon's surface may be laid broad and deep,

tliat the superstructure may be characterized by accuracy and precision as

well in recording detail as in discussing observations, and that the results

arrived at may be beyond dispute and fully capable of testing any question

--that may arise as to the state of the moon's surface.
    Registration of Objects. During the past Association year, the regis-

--tration of objects has proceeded in conformity with the mode adopted in pre-

vious years. The numbers are as follows :

       553   on 128 areas in Quadrant  I.

       ^53 ,,  86   ,,  ,, 11.
       215 ,,  57   ,,  ,, 111.
       642 ,,  62   ,,  ,, lY.

Total  1763    333

--Outliist: Map. The drawing of area IV A^ has been prepared, engraved,

and a number printed for distribution ; also a catalogue of 99 objects upon
this area has been compiled and printed. Several corrections and additions
to areas IV A" and IV A^ have been made ; so that the number of objects in-
serted on the maps, either engraved or in MS., and included in the Catalogue,
amounts to 337, which is a trifle less than 1 of the number inserted in the

folio registers.

    In preparing the catalogue, every care has been taken to meet the growing
requirements of selenographical research. The doubts that surround the

labours of earlier selenographers, as to correctness of details, many delinea-

tions being conventional rather than actual, combined with the absence of

precision in describing lunar features, render it essential that the description

of an object should, if possible, embody its principal characteristics at a given
epoch. The compilation of the catalogue was commenced with this view ; and
it has been steadily maintained in the portion accompanying this Eeport as
well in the previous ones, each description being as much as possible equiva-

lent to a trustworthy observation.

   As the positions of objects on the outline map are for mean libration, it
may be weU to mention that the moon attains a state of mean libration

--(nearly) in 1868 on October 24'^ 20" 8".
   Eesttlts of Observations. More than thirty-two gentlemen have under-
taken the examination of special zones or particular objects. The work
acconiplished in accordance with the instructions in the lettei-press of IV A",

--IV Ai is as foUows : 106 objects in the three areas have been independently

identified, /. e. originally laid down from De La Hue's and Rutherford's pho-

tograms, or from observations made by the Secretary ; they have been reob-

served by gentlemen in whose zones they occur. In seven cases the obser-

vations were made by four independent observers, in six cases they
were made by three independent observers, in 32 cases by two, and in 61
by one obseiTer only. Appendix II. contains the Association symbols of
these objects, with such notes as may be deemed necessary, also the addi-
tions to the map and catalogue. See jjos^, pp. 40 and 41.

   Observations of this kind may be greatly facilitated by choosing " test
objects" in accordance with the suggestion of Mr. Slack, who recommends
" Crater-Row " (IV A( is, IV Ai ", IV Ai i5, IV Ai is, IV A( i^, five craterlets)
as very suitable for area IV Ai. If the craterlets, especially IV Ai i^ and

IVA^i^, come out sharply and well defined, and can be seen distinctly and
without tremor, the earth's atmosphere is in a good state for observation ; and

if, at the same time, neighbouring objects are indistinct, hazy, and Hi-defined

(phenomena that may be occasionally noticed), then it would appear that this

indistinctness is not occasioned by the state of the earth's atmosphere, hut

    Particuiar Phenomena. Under this head may bo classed observations of
LinnS, the spot IV A" i^, lY A.( ^^, Alpetrac/iiis d, and others of the same kind

(see^30S<, pp. 29 and 41). From my own observations, and from several others

which have come to hand, it appears that those phenomena that have been
considered indicative of " change " have been mostly characterized by occa-

sional indistinctness of the objects observed, contributing to the suspicion

that such objects have either disappeared, or that new craters have been

formed. Without a very careful discussion in connexion with solar alti-
tudes and azimuths, and the difference between the angle of incidence on the
moon's surface and the angle of reflexion from the moon's surface, which is

--equal to the supplement of the angle ^ ©, it is very difficult to refer

--such phenomena to their legitimate sources.
    Change. The question of " change " on the moon's surface still remains

undecided. Although the circumstances associated with the earlier records
and delineations fail to invest them with that authority which is necessary

to a decision of the question, they are nevertheless exceedingly important,
and a careful study of the works of the foiu' leading selenographers, Schi'oter,

Lohrmaim, Beer and Madler, and Schmidt, is essential to a competent know-
ledge of the surface of our satellite. The "facts" recorded by them are
very numerous. These facts, compared with the results obtained by the aid
of photography, and with those of recent observation, must tend in no small

degree to advance selenographical knowledge.

   In the course of such a comparison many differences will be found. Ear-

lier delineations and photograms will not agree ; and in seelcing for an expia-

tion of such differences, we are natiirally led to regard variations of distance,

libration, and illumination as fi-uitful sources of apparent change. It has
been a matter of solicitude in preparing the areas and catalogue already issued,
to define the extent of apparent change produced by alterations of distance

and by libration, which near the middle of the moon is but small. Appa-

rent changes occasioned by differences in the angles of illumination are not

so easily dealt with. Before we can venture to express an opinion on a sup-

posed apparent change as dependent upon the sun's altitude above and his

azimuth at any particular spot, it is manifestly necessary to know all the

changes of appearance which the object undergoes as the sun rises higher
above it, cidminates, and declines. This necessarily involves a considerable
amount of calculation, especially if the three coordinates are employed, viz.
the latitude of the spot, the sun's declination, and his hour-angle. Some

approximation, however, may be made to the sun's altitude at intervals of

12 hours, from his rising at the moon's equator, on a point at which the lon-
gitudes of the terminator and the spot agree, to his meridian passage at the

same point. I am accordingly prejiaring a set of Tables of Solar Altitudes

at intervals of twelve hours (nearly) for every five degrees of lunar latitude,

and also for the solstices and equinoxes at each. The Tables for the Equator,
5°, and 10° of latitude wiU be foimd on pp. 10 and 11.

   Before a correct judgment can be formed on the gradations of appearance
presented by any one spot as the sun's altitude increases and declines, it is
necessary to obtain observations of that spot at intervals of at least 12 hours.
The greatest change of altitude during this interval is a little more than 6°
on the equator. This change in 12 hours decreases as a spot is situated
N. or S. of the equator. To obtain a sufficient number of observations for
this purpose, observers must confine in some degree their attention to parti-

                                                                             b2

cular objects for many lunations, so that a normal character of the appearance

of a certain spot with any given mean solar altitude may be determined.

Ten observations for each interval would be necessary before the normal

character could be considered sufficiently ascertained, in order to distinguish

between apparent and real change. This process is clearly a work of time ;
it is nevertheless absolutely necessary to settle such a question as that which

has been raised in respect of Linne. The observations of this spot are now

numerous ; various opinions have been expressed vdth regard to it ; but as

yet they are inconclusive, the observations being little better than " raw

material." "When they have undergone the examination above proposed, we
may be the better able to arrive at some conclusion respecting Linne.

In the course of " Zone Observations," and therefore entirely originating

with the labours of this Committee, another spot of apparently the same

nature as Linne, so far as recent observations are concerned, has been detected.

Not previously known, it has been described imder the symbols IV A" i^,
IVAf39 as a "bright spot." The Eev. W. 0. Williams of Pwllheli, in

whose pair of subzones it occurs (see letterpress IV A", IV A?, pp. 5 & 6,

and Report British Association, 1866, pp. 241, 242), has fully confirmed an

observation which I made in 1867 on May 11, when I saw it as a shallow

crater. Mr. Williams has observed it as a crater with a central cone, Mr.

Baxendell has seen it as a well-marked shallow crater, and Mr. Williams has

frequently seen it as a bright white spot, I have lately ascertained, by the

aid of the Crossley Equatorial, that it is situated on the summit of a mountain-

range, and is opened in an irregxilar depression on this summit. For

a digest of the existing observations arranged in order of solar altitudes

see p. 29. They are, however, too few in number to determine at present

the normal character for each group of 6° of altitude ; but there are a few
differences of appearance with similar altitudes which claim attention.

   Probably the only circumstance that we are acquainted with as connected
with our own atmosphere capable of rendering an object on the moon's sur-

face indistinct, and sometimes obliterating it altogether, is the agitation pro-

duced by the mixture of air of different densities. Every observer knows the

difference between good and bad definition, which passes through a variety

of gradations from the greatest steadiness to the most violent " boiling."

When the normal character of a spot under a certain altitude of the sun is

well known, departures from this character become apparent ; and if the ob-

servations have been well recorded and all known circumstances capable of

affecting it registered, these departures stand out as residual pltenomena

awaiting explanation. It may be that the differences above alluded to are

of this nature                                                            but  it is manifestly premature to discuss them  until the ob-
                                                                       ;

servations have sufficiently accumulated to determine the normal character of

the spot under every angle of illumination.

   Herr Schmidt has announced that another spot, Alpetragius d [III Kv 4],
has manifested somewhat similar phenomena. I have carefully examined it

with the Crossley Equatorial, and find it exactly as desricbed by Schmidt,

viz. a bright nebulous round spot of light, larger than Linne, with a small

crater on the extreme S. edge of the bright spot. Lohrmann gives a bright

elongated spot with a small hUl on it ; and B. & M. have drawn it distinctly

as a crater.

The following is the letter addressed by Herr Schmidt to the Secretary of

the Lunar Committee of the British Association for the Advancement of

Science. The translation is by W. T. Lynn, Esq., of the Royal Observatory,

--HoNOTTEED SiK, I have lately given attention to a region of the moon

which deserves in future a more accurate investigation. Although it fur-
nishes by no means so significant a case as was afforded by Linne, it shows,
however, something analogous, and leads to a better knowledge of certain
spots of light which cannot in all cases be explained by mere phenomena of

reflexion. The region in question is situated easterly near Alpetragius, the
spot of light to which I direct your attention in 12° east longitude and 14°
south latitude =cZ. Schroter has nothing about it. Lohrmann's (unedited)
plate gives a very large spot of light, almost 2° in magnitude, and a very

small hill inside it.

Madler draws a crater of almost a mile [4*6 miles English] in diameter,

and says in his * Selenography ' [Der Mond], page 304, line 22 from above,
" In the fm-thest east shines also with a light of 8° the smaU crater d."

   This crater d now no longer exists ; but in its place is a round spot of

Hght more than 2 miles [9-2 English] broad, extremely brilliant, which has

quite the character of the light spot Linne, and of the few others of this kind

which also are found upon the moon. The small neighbouring crater south

--of d which Madler gives is still distinctly visible.
   I have annexed three sketches the first from Madler, the second from

Lohrmann, the third my own, on the scale of my chart.
  WlU you have the goodness to take an opportunity of informing the Lunar

Committee of this notice, and request new observations with large instru-

ments ?

                       With the greatest esteem.

                                                                                                                           Yours most truly,

                                                                                                                                         J. E, JiTLnTS Schmidt.

   Bright spots on the moon are of two kinds, viz. those which are clearly
and unmistakeably the slopes of mountains or the interiors of craters, and
those which appear as round nebulous spots, apparently on the moon's sur-
face, the true nature of which we are at present ignorant of. The bright-
ness of the first class depends upon the following conditions, which determine

--the angle of Ulumination 1° and 2° the sun's altitude and azimuth at the

spot, 3° and 4°, the angles which the slope and direction make with the lunar
horizon and meridian. In the case of each particidar spot certain values of

the above-mentioned angles determine the maximum of illumination, and

consequently the greatest brightness in the course of the lunar day. The

bright spots of the second class do not conform to the before-mentioned con-
ditions. They are apparently horizontal ; biit it has not yet been ascertained

by observation whether they are in contact with the surface or otherwise.
The three spots of this nature which have been most extensively observed

are Linne [IE*' i], Posidonins y [lE"^], and IV A" i? lY Af 39, and these

present some very remarkable differences. Nearly throughout the whole

course of the lunar day Linne appears as a white spot, varying slightly in

brightness, and more so in size                                                                                            generally it  appears as nearly as possible of
                                                                                                                        ;

about the same size and brilliancy as Posidonius y, sometimes slightly ex-

ceeding y, and at other times a trifle less both in size and brightness. Posi-

donius y is the highest part of a ridge on the Mare Serenitatis, having on its

summit a minute pit. Linne, from the latest observations, is a small cone

on a nearly level portion of the Mare. At and shortly after sunrise both have

been distinctly seen as well-defined bright spots of the first class. At a very

early period of the lunar day Linne exchanges the characteristics of the first

class for those of the second. Posidonius y has not been observed so assidu-

ously as Linne ; it has, however, been found to retain the appearance of a

mountain to a later period in the lunar day, when Linne has exhibited nothing

but the ill-defined nebulous spot.

   IV A" 1^ IV Ai 39, which differs from Linne and Posidonius y, is a crater

opened in the bottom of a depression which occurs in a mountain-chain on

the east border of HipparcJms. Similarly to Linne and Posidonius y, it is dis-
tinct and well defined shortly after sunrise, but, unlike them, it retains this

appearance for a much longer period of the lunar day. Fnder a low solar

altitude the eastern interior side of the depression in which the crater is situ-

ated is very bright, showing that for some time after sunrise it must be in-

cluded in the first class of bright spots. On some occasions, when the sun

has attained an altitude of about 20° above its horizon, it has presented a

very similar appearance to that of Limit and Posidonius y. On other occa-

sions this appearance has not been observed until the sun has attained an

Aaltitude of nearly 40°.  bright streak has also been noticed extending from

it towards the east, while the crater-form has been distinctly visible, with a

solar altitude of nearly 30°. With solar altitudes above 48° to meridian

altitude 85°, the appearance has been that of two nehidous bright sjjots of the

second class.
   While the three objects under high solar altitudes present precisely the

same appearance, the lunar surface in each case differs materially : Linne, a
small isolated cone with crater opening (?) on a comparatively level surface ;

MPosidonius y, the highest point of a mountain-ridge, having a minute perfo-

ration ; IV A" 1'' IV 39, a somewhat large opening, -ndth a small central

 one, in a depression also upon the summit of a mountain-range. It is clearly
the province of observation to endeavour to ascertain in each case the circum-
stances which are intimately connected with t\i.e first appearance of the white
spot. Apparently these spots appear to be on the surface. In the case of
Linne the spot spreads around the cone or crater ; in that of Posidonius y it
extends around the summit of the mountain, while in that of IV A" ^'^

IV A? 39 it covers the depression and included crater. Of the four conditions

of brightness in the first class of bright sj)ots, the sun's altitude appears to be
connected with the first appearance of the white spot in the second class, but

Mnot regularly so, inasmuch as it appears earliest in Linne and latest in

IV A" 17 IV 39. The discussion of observations is not sufficiently advanced

to ascertain if the sun's azimiith at all affects these spots. The third and

fourth conditions of the first class are clearly inappHcable to spots of the second

class.

It has been suggested that the nature of the surface in these localities is

Wesuch as to reflect the hazy light we see.  have in the three examples

before us three different kmds of surfaces, as above mentioned. The greatest

similarity of appearance of the white spot occurs in those cases in which the

surfaces are most dissimilar, viz. a nearly level plain from which rises a

small cone, and a mountain peak having a small orifice. While the surfaces

are dissimilar, the feature in which the two objects closely resemble each

Weother is the minute orifice which has been seen in both.   have conse-

--quently in two objects greatly dificring from each other, two very close points

of resemblance the minute orifice seen \vith very low solar altitudes, and the

comparatively large white spot seen under higher altitudes.

symbols for indicating certain objects on the maps, inserted on p. 4 of letter-

press to areas IV A", TV AC, and Report Brit. Assoc. 1866, p. 240, three

   Objects are south and east of their mean places.

--For size: Moon's semidiameter 15' 12"-9; mean semidiameter 15' 32"*3.

  A circle of one degree in diameter at the centre of the moon's disk is seen

under an angle of 16"-277 ; at 5° of longitude W. or E. the degree is fore-

shortened in a radial direction, ?. e. on the equator by 0"-061, the shortest
diameter being 16"-216. At 10°, the N.W. angle of area IV A^, or N.E. of

III A^, the foreshortening amounts to 0"-247, or nearly a quarter of a second,
the shortest diameter being 16"-030.

   The number of English feet subtending an angle of l"-0 at the centre of the

moon's disk at mean distance is 6116-7. This value is increased in receding

from the centre in the proportion of the secants of the angular distances from
the centre ; consequently at the middle point of each area the value of 1"*0 is

greater than at the centre of the moon's disk ; for, by reason of the spherical

surface of the moon, l"-0 covers a greater portion of the surface at a point

removed from the centre than at the centre. At the middle point of IV A",

or 2° 30' W. long., 2° 30' S. lat, the angular distance from the centre =3° 32',

which gives 6128-3 English feet for the value of l"-0. At the middle point

of IV A^, or 7° 30' W. long., 2° 30' S. lat., the angular distance from the centre
=7° 54', -which gives 6175-3 EngUsh feet for the value of l"-0. This is also

the value for the middle point of IV M. At the middle of IV A\ or 7° 30'

="W. long., 7° 30' S. lat., the angular distance from the centre 10° 35', -which

gives 6222-7 English feet for the value of l"-0.

   While the values of l"-0 vary in the proportion of the secants as -we recede
from the centre of the disk, the objects themselves remain of the same extent,
and are seen at mean Ubration, either under the larger angle produced by the
moon passing her perigean point, or under the smaller as she passes her apo-

gee. Taking 6116-7 as a standard quantity, expressing the diameter of a
circle seen under an angle of l"-0 at mean distance, this quantity is seen at

the centre of the disk, onean Ubration, moon in perigee, under an angle of

+l"-059 , moon in apogee 0"-941. At perigee, mean Ubration, at the middle

--point of IV A"*, the foreshortening of an object of this extent is given by the

following numbers : Longest diameter l"-059, shortest l"-057. The differ-
ence is perfectly inappreciable ; it is therefore presumable that we see very
nearly the true forms of the objects on this area. At apogee, mean Ubration,

--the proportions are 0"-941 longest diameter, 0"-939 shortest. For the
--middle points of IV A^ and IV Af we have : longest diameter l"-059, shortest

1"*049, moon in perigee; and 0"-941 longest diameter, 0"- 932 shortest, moon

--in apogee. At the middle point of IV A"" the foreshortening is greater, but

still small : moon in perigee, longest diameter l"-059, shortest 1"-041 ; moon

in apogee, longest diameter 0"-941, shortest 0"-925.

   All the objects situated in areas IV A" and IV A^ are so affected by libration
that we see alternately more or less of their N. and S. sides. From the ele-

ments of Eutherford's photogram already given, it is easy to perceive that

although the places are laid down on the areas for mean libration, the IST. sides

of the objects are presented in that photogram more directly to the eye ; and

this will to some extent affect the outline, inasmuch as the measures, more

particularly of the mountain-slopes, must necessarily include the larger angle

under which they are seen on the photogram. It is only such objects as the

orifices of craters, rings, and generally surface-markings, that are foreshort-

ened to a greater degree as they are removed further from the eye by the

effect of libration. The angle under which a mountain-slope, or any object
which is elevated above the surface, is seen, is increased by libration as it is

carried further from, and decreases as it is brought nearer to the eye ; for if

we take a mountain-range lying E. and W. on the equator, moon in node, we

see the N. and S. slopes under the smallest angles. As the moon attains a

greater N. latitude, the mountain-range is seen N. of its normal position, and

we see more of its S. slope and lose its N. slope, the reverse taking place as
the moon attains S. latitude. The degree of visibility of mountain- slopes or

objects that are more or less elevated above the surface within the areas

above mentioned is dependent more or less upon three conditions : 1°, the

angle which the crest or longitudinal direction of an object makes with a lunar

meridian                              2°, the angle which the slope makes with a vertical perpendicular
                                   ;

to the moon's surface; and, 3°, the angle through which it is moved by the effect

of libration. In each case there is a maximum effect, determined by the posi-

tion and direction of the object. The visibility of objects -ndthin a zone of

1° 32' 9" N. or S. of the moon's equator is also affected by another circumstance,

viz. the direction in which the sun's rays faU upon such objects at different sea-

sons of the lunar year ; for example, a mountain-range lying E. and W. on the

moon's equator wiU have its IST. slope illuminated wMle the sun is N. of the

moon's equator, and its S. slope duiing the opposite season. The lunar sea-

sons are easily found. When the sun's longitude, as seen from the moon

(which does not at the utmost differ more than 8' from the longitude as seen

from the earth), is equal to the longitude of the moon's ascending node, the

sun is vertical to the moon's equator, passing from S. to N". When the differ-

ence between the longitudes of the sun and node equals 90°, the N. pole is

enlightened, and the season is summer in the northern hemisphere. When the

longitudes of the sun and node differ 180°, it is the autumnal equinox in the

northern hemisphere, and when the difference amounts to 270° it is winter,

the S. pole being illuminated. These quantities may be thus expressed for

the northern hemisphere :

                                      O-- S3 = 0°+        Siin in equator ascending.

                                               =270

   In order to find the season, and consequently the illumination due to it of
an object in the tropical zone 1° 32' 9" N. and S. of the moon's equator, nothing

further is requisite than to find from the Nautical Almanac the longitudes of
© --the sun and node
                                                                                                                        :
                                           the quantity                                                                    £3 wiU give the season as above.

© --If the sine of the angle                              S3 be multiplied into the sine of 1° 32' 9", the

inclination of the moon's equator to the ecliptic, we obtain the sine of an angle

which represents respectively the following quantities:-- 1°, the sun's decli-

nation as seen from the moon ; 2°, the inclination of the equator of illumina-

tion to the moon's equator ; and, 3°, the inclination of the terminator to the
lunar meridian which it intersects.

   Erom the above considerations it follows that in the tJiree areas now issued,
and also in the corresponding areas in Quadrants I., II., and III., we see lunar

objects of very nearly their true forms, and that libration does not materially

affect either their forms or magnitudes,

The visibility of objects generally is affected in a much greater degree by

the morning and evening illuminatious. Shortly after sunrise the slopes of

mountains facing the W. are so illuminated that their detail may be well and

satisfactorily made out. It is only a little before sunset that the E. slopes are

similarly illuminated. Most of the apparent changes in the appearance of

objects are due to these illuminations. It is, however, manifest that loiu and

Wefiat objects are less affected than high and sloping ones.  have already

indicated (letterpress, areas IV A", \V M, p. 7, and Report Brit. Assoc. 1866,

p. 243) the mode of finding epochs of similar iUumination ; still the changes
which some objects imdergo as the sun rises above their horizons are so re-

markable that it may in some measure assist the observer in endeavouring to
refer these changes to their legitimate sources, if we give for the limits of

each zone of 5° the sim's altitude for intervals of 12 hours during the period

elapsing from sumise to meridian passage, which will also be applicable to

the decline from meridian passage to sunset. The epoch of sunrise at any

--particular spot with  £3 =0° or 180° is manifestly that at which the lon-
0--gitudes of the spot and tenniuator are equal; with

One or two trials for obtaining the longitude of the terminator will be

quite sufficient for finding the altitude for any given interval. In the case

of the morning terminator, if its longitude is east of and differs from the

longitude of the spot a few degrees only, the altitude will be found between

interval and 12 hours. It will, however, be best to compute a longitude

of the terminator as near as may be to that of the spot, from the epoch of
which intervals of 12 hours to meridian passage may very readily be found.

In addition to the period of similar phase, SQ'i l** 28°\ we have a still closer

XX of each month of the Nautical Almanac, headed " Days elapsed of the

Julian Period," wUl greatly facUitate the application of this longer period.

Changes arising from season and libration may, in consequence of comparing

observations at epochs so distant, become more strikingly manifest.

                              Introduction.

A few remarks upon the classes of objects found on this area and one or two

--other points may not be inappropriate ; they are given under the following

heads : Points of the first order. Extent of surface. General features.

--Mountain-chains. Faults. Levels. Craters. Sequence of objects.
   Points of the flrst Okdee. The deteiiniuation of one or two points of the

first order in this area w^ould be very advantageous for correcting the positions

of objects in this and the neighbouring areas. For the mode of observing and

computing, with an example, see Report Brit. Assoc. 1866, pp. 233 to 238.

There are no isolated objects near the centre that would be suitable for this

pui-pose; but IV A^ i^ is well situated for areas IV A", IV A^, and IV A'', and
the crater IV A^^ for the N.W. part of area IV A^.

  --Extent of Surface. This is the same as area IV A", viz. 8877"925 square

miles English, but, in consequence of foreshortening (see ante, p. 8), it does not

appear to be so. The difference, however, is slight ; for IV A" occupies on the
moon's equator -0872 parts of the moon's radius considered as unity, and IV A^

--·086.5 such parts.
   General Features. This area consists principally of an elevated district

bordering upon the lower surface of the W. part of Hipparchus. It is not

marked by any very bold features, except the W.N.W. border of Hipparclius,

which presents apparently a steep slope towards the lower land. This slojae

may be well studied under the evening illumination, at about 19 or 20 days

of the moon's age. With this exception, the surface is slightly irregular,

dotted here and there with low mountains. The N.W. angle contains the

central portion of what appears to be the remains of a large walled plain, biit

so altered by subsequent changes of the surface as to be scarcely recognizable.

vations of the physical aspects of the moon's surface, by which it is difficult to
arrive at any satisfactory conclusions relative to alleged physical change, ren-

ders it not only important but imperative that observations should now be
conducted with such precision that no doubt may hereafter arise as to the

real state of the object observed and recorded ; it is accordingly intended that
the description of each object recorded in the foUowiug pages shall be equi-

valent to a trustworthy and accurate observation ; and as such observations
can be obtained by means of photography, the epoch is that of the photogram

employed, viz. 1865, March 6, unless otherwise expressed. Among the most

mprominent objects on the moon's surface are craters. It is this class of

objects that change has been suspected. To indicate the precision attainable
with our present means, a list of the craters on area IV A^ is subjoined in the
order of magnitude, so that, if any question should hereafter arise as to any
 one of them, this record, with the photogram from which it is compUed, vdll,
 it is hoped, be sufficient evidence of the state of each in the year 1865 on
 March 6 ; and to prevent any after-misapprehension as to whether these ob-
jects are actually craters, engravings are given of most of them, with the
proportions of shadow to illuminated interior, at an epoch which may be ap-
 proximately indicated by the longitude of terminator being equal to 21° E.

   Mr. Slack has suggested that " crater-row " (see letterpress, areas LV A",

IV Af, p. 23, 1 19, and Brit. Assoc. Report, 1866, p. 259) should he regarded

as a "test object" of the state of the earth's atmosphere, particularly with

regard to definition; for example, if the craters, some of which are difficult,

come out sharply and well defined, and can be seen distinctly and without

tremor, the earth's atmosphere is in a good state for observation. When this

is the case, and neighbouring objects are indistinct, hazy, and ill-defined, it

may be inferred that such indistinctness is not occasioned by the state of the

earth's atmosphere, but is dependent upon some other agency. In accordance

with this suggestion, it is recommended that in the examination of the fol-

lowing objects the state of " crater-row " should be first ascertained.

While these sheets were passing through the press, Edward Crossley, Esq.,

of Halifax, kindly lent the Committee his 7-3-iQch achromatic of 12 feet focal

length, equatorially mounted. This instrimient is now in working order at

Walthamstow, and a systematic examination of the objects in the three areas,

under favourable circumstances, the sun has been seen clearly shining.

IV A^ * forms the E. rim of the crater IV A^ ^, at the IST. end of which

another break occurs. Eeyond this break is seen the mountain-range IV A^ i.

but, not having seen them, I have not yet inserted them upon the map. There

as being like a string of pearls. It is probable they may be detected a short

time after sunrise. At the western end of IV A^ i another break in the boun-

tinued by the depression IV A^ *. This depression completes the boundary

the plain IV M'^, IV A^ ^ being quite open towards the S.W.

1864, Dec. 5, 6^ 30" to 7*" 55", this region was carefully observed with

the Royal Society's achromatic of 4|-in. aperture, power 230. The details

Arecorded then mostly agree with the features as seen on the photogram.

--few have not been recognized, of which the principal are as follows : " The

western part of the boundary was seen to consist of three detached rocks, of

which the southern one was rather elongated. The mountain-arm IV A^ -'^

was observed to end in an irregular boss or club-shaped elevation, of less

brightness than the mountain-arm."

IV A'' i, on the N. by the mountain-ranges IV A^ \ IV A^ i3, on the E. by
IV AP 1 and IV A^ *, and on the S.E. by IV A^ 39.

 --This plain is quite open towards the S.W., and has upon it the following

objects : The crater IV A^ ^, which is the most conspicuous ; a somewhat

short elevated ridge, i^robably Lohrmann's 61 of his Sec. I., which I do not

recognize on the photogram ; and two minute hillocks between the ridge and

crater. These hillocks are recorded in Obs. Bk. p. 164, No. 315, 1864, Dec.

5, 7.15 G.M.T. They are neither inserted in the map nor symboHzed, as I

do not find a second observation of them, and, not having made a sketch at

the time, I am uncertain as to their position. I have the following note :

" With the exception of 60 and 61, Lohrmaun gives the surface of this forma-

tion smooth. At present I do not see any other inequahties than the two

--minute hillocks." On Rutherford's photogram I find two objects to which

the hillocks observed in 1864 may answer IV A^ ^^, described as a "hillock

on the plain, and IV A^ ^i, a shallow depression." It is probable I saw only

the slope of the depression, which I regarded as that of a hillock.

This plain on Rutherford's j^hotogram has greatly the appearance of a large

ancient crater which has suffered from irruption and become nearly filled.

If such has been the case, the wall has been broken through on the S.W., the

open portion facing a somewhat smooth tract, agreeing in this respect with

the numerous ruined craters (as they appear to be) on the borders of the

Maria. The plain is interestingly situated with regard to Godin and Agrippa.

The crater IV A^ ^, as weU as the cliffs between IV A^ ^ and IV A^ i-*, are

probably of more recent origin than the plain. The depressions IV A^ * and

IV A^ 41 at the extremities of the N.W. and S.E. ranges are remarkable.

The occurrence of mountains standing in shcdloiv depressions is not uncommon

in some parts of the moon ; it is a curious feature, and deserves careful con-
sideration as weU as observation.

  A very remarkable and interesting feature is connected with this plain,

ON MAPPING THE SURFACE OF THE MOON.                                    17

viz. a kind of '' circumvallation " (consisting either of low mountains or, at

some parts, of depressions) surrounds it, at an average distance from the

centre of 35"-24, not very unlike the second rampart of lihceticus (see letter-

press, areas IV A", IV A^, p. 12, and Brit. Assoc. Eeport, 1866, p. 248), or

Athe cliiFs surrounding IV A""* (see ibid. pp. 13, 249).  portion of a similar

circumvallation exists on the N.W. of Agrijipa. The circumvallation sur-

rounding IV A^ 2 is hest traced on the N. in the mountains W. and E. of

Godin, including the S. border of that crater. The depression IV A^ ^^ and

the mountain IV A^ *^ are situated upon this line of circumvallation. Here

it becomes obscui-e, but cau be traced passing between IV A^ ^* and IV A^ "t^,

and continued in the mountain-chain extending from the junction of Ptole-

mceus and Alplionsus towards Sabine and Eifter (see ante, p. 13). From this

mountain-chain the curve is continued to its junction with the S. of Godin.
   The area enclosed by this " circumvallation " is about equal to that of the

floor of Ptolemceus. Is this the remnant of a large walled plain which in-

cluded a crater, nearly central, within it ? Its position with regard to Ptole-

mceus is interesting, especially as the diverse groups on and near Hipparchus

--intervene. Its ancient character may be inferred from its being traversed by

more than one " fault :" first, a " ray from Tycho," which passes across its

eastern segment; second, by the "fault" IV A^ ''2, which also crosses this

segment. The "fault" IV A''35 IV A^'^-^ grazes the E. edge of the ancient waU.

The following passage from the Eev. T. W. Webb's notice of Chacornac's

* Theory of Lunar Physics ' is so much to.the purpose that I quote it at length.
" Among other characteristics of the primitive surface, we notice immense

--rings, whose crests alone project above the surrounding plain by some hundreds

of yards circular ramparts, the last visible vestiges of great buried craters ;
and these are cut through by considerable breaches, which permit us to follow

the level of the maritime soil, where it penetrates their interiors, and to re-

mark the absence of the slightest difference in surface or structure." Intel-

lectual Observer, No. xlvii. Dec. 1865, p. 373.

The surface of the area included within the line of circumvallation is in

strildng contrast with that of Ptolemceus. If it has ever been in the same

state as that magnificent plain, the changes it has undergone must have been

considerable. From a smooth level surface, surrounded by a rampart of

mountains, the remains of which we are now only able to trace imperfectly,

it must have passed into a state during which the central parts have been

elevated, and the surface attained a degree of subdued irregularity very diffe-

rent from the surfaces of the great walled plains. While nearly every vestige

of the characteristics of a Availed plain has disappeared, the surface included

by the circumvallation possesses a certain uniformity of aspect which gives an

individuality to it, and which clearly separates it fi'om the features external

to it. It is singularly free from craters, two only of any magnitude being

foimd upon it, viz. IV A^^^ and the crater S.S.E. of Godin, I A^^. Should

the conjecture be correct that we have here the remains of a large walled

plain, the intermediate changes that it has imdergone indicate it to have

been very ancient, perhaps among the most ancient of lunar forms.

Hipparchus may be regarded as intermediate in character between this for-

Wemation widi Ptolemceus.  shall have to direct attention (seQpost, p. 37) to

the probability that at some anterior epoch the depressed floor of Hipparchus

and the higher land W. of it were at the same level, and that the whole of
the district W. of Hipparchus, including the plain under consideration, has

since been elevated. If so, from the appearance which this waUed plain now

^e^presents, it is probable that the rampart was nearly   prior to the general

elevation of the district of which it forms a part. This also points to its great
antiquity, especially as the " fault " separating Hipparclius from the district

appears to be comparatively recent.

   It is difficult to determine whether Lohiinann really intended the S. ex-

tional range between 63 and 60, which is not apparent on the photogram.

If he did not, then his range 63, Sec. I., is much longer than it ought to be. The
cliffs between IV A^ ^ and IV A^ 1* are very indiflerently shown by Lohrmann.
The boldest are certainly in the neighboui'hood of IV A^ ^. His 59, See. I.

Sec. I. with central mountain, the surrounding mountains being 62 (IV A^ ^^),
63 (IVA^si), and 64 (lA^-'S) of his Sec. I. He also speaks of two low
rows of mountains between them. He says that in the midst of the Interior

plain a small central mountain is elevated. There is certainly nothing of the

kind on Eutherford's photogram, March 6, 1865, neither jj^a^i nor central

mountain. On the W. of IV A^ ^^ is a hoUow, IV A^-^^, communicating with

a semicrater, neither of which are shown by Lohi-maun . The boldness with
which the formations IV A^ ^^ and IV A^ *^ appear on the photogram is quite

absent in B. & M.'s large map. IV A^ ^i is more distinct in the small map,

1837, but shown as a plain without a central mountain.

Crater-row pretty well defined ; IV A^ 11 very distinct, with the crater

IV A3 12 upon it. The surface of the hill is in the form of a tableland,
IV A3 29 and IV A3 52 rising higlier on the E., the W. slope of IV A3 «i

descending to the hollow.

It is very possible that Lohrmann regarded the tableland as an enclosed

plain. The question now is whether the crater IV A3 12 was regarded by

him as a mountain. I do not see an exterior shadow on the E. ; fig. 3 is too

dark on the E. and N.E. The shading is not intended to indicate shadow,

--but the slope of the mountain on the N.E. [W. R. B.]
   As in the case oi Linne, it may possibly be considered that both Lohrmann
and B. & M. are in error. It does not appear that B. &. M. mention the

formation. The following is a translation by the Eev. T. "W. "Webb, of Lohr-

 as far as the E. edge of the crater IV A^ ^^, the boundary is nearly rectilinear
 and nearly coincident with the "fault " IV A" n, IV A^ 20^ IV A" 72, which,
 probably originating in the crater IV A"" 2, has either elevated the sui-face on
 the W. or depressed the surface of the W. portion of Hippcu-clms, so that it is
 considerably below the high land ; between IV A^ i9 and IV A^ i^ this high land
 rises into the peaks IV A^ ^s ^nd IV A^ *7. At the crater IV A^ i'^ this portion
 of the boundary forms a very obtuse angle with the valley IV A^ 3i iya." ",
 which extends as far as the IS", end of IV A" 10. Here the boimdary becomes
 indistinct. Eeer and Miidler, who do not give the " fault " nor the valley,
 show the boimdary as turning E. at IV A^ ^^, passing the cliff or moimtain
 IV A" 1* at the S. end of IV A'' 10, and passing along the depressions IV A" 12
 and IV A'^ i^ (neither of which they show), proceeding to the crater IV A" 7,
 and further continued parallel with the "W. mountainous border (IV Ai *'')
 of IV Af 24^ Lohrmann's W, Sec. I., through the crater IV A^^ to or near
 the small crater IV Af 33. The dotted line shows the approximate direction

 of the N. and S.E. boundaries as given by B. & M. and Lohrmann. Lohr-
 mann in Sec. I. indicates, although not very distinctly, the " fault " and

  valley.

    The IS", and S.E. boundaries of Hipparclius, as laid down by B. & M. and

 Lohrmann, are by no means so distinct on the photogram as shown on the

 map and section. The natural boundary of the large formation Terra As-
 tronomica appears to be continued from the junction of the valley IV A^ 3i
 IV A" " with the " fault " IV A" " IV A^ 20 ly A" «, along the higher land

 between the valley and Bhceticus, through the S.E. mountainous border of
 Bhaiticus to the N.E. angle of Rhaiticus N. of the equator ; it then trends

E.S.E. along the S.W. border of the Sinus Medii to the N". border of the little

plain N.E. of Eeaiunur. From thence it trends E. to the mass of high land
on the N.W. border of Lohrmann's U, Sec. I., IIIA"S the W. border of which

The N.E. line of chffs (direction N.W.-S.E.) is a portion of a somewhat in-

terrupted line which extends from the E. border of Ptolemmis to a mass of

high land E. of Agrippa. In crossing the Terra Astronomica from the W.

border of Herschel, it is slightly curved, the convexity being towards the

S.W. and the faces of the cliiis towards the N.E. The altitude may be about

equal to the lower portions of the mountainous border of Ftolemceus. It is

very imperfectly represented on B. & M.'s and Lohrmann's maps, but it may

be traced on Lohrmann's Sec. I., although the character of a range of cliff's

is not given. Passing along the range from Herschel towards the N.W., we

valley on the N.W. is a short mountain-arm, which springs from the line of

cliffs, and probably forms the highest part of the boundary of the valley on

the N.W. It is next cut by a " fault," III A" » and III A^ i5, which will be

hereafter described. Just W. of this " fault " is the crater IV A"" « III A " lo,

which is situated on the hne of cliffs and appears to be its culminating

point. From thence the line is continued to the S. edge of Reaumur, and

merges into the S.W. and W. border oi Reaumur, of which IV A" 5 is the
highest point. From the W. border of Reaumur the crater IV A" ^ appears

to connect it with the short mountain-chain IV A" ^^, which joins the S.E.

border of Rha'tiais. This line of cliffs is more strongly marked on the

photogram than the boundary of Hipparchus, as shown by B. & M. and

Lohrmann.

 --Mountahis. The isolated mountains on this formation are but few ; the

most important are IV A? ^o and IV Af ^i on the subformation IV Ai ^s. The

remainder are either chffs or mountain-borders of depressions and plains.

 --Plains. Three distinct plauis may be specified as occurring on this forma-
--tion Lohrmann's W, Sec. I., Reaumur, and the small plain N.E. of it. They

are aU surrounded by mountain-borders. To these may be added the S.W.
part of Hlpparclms, W. of the westerly line of cliffs, which is the most level

part of the formation.

 --Depressions. The most remarkable and important of these is the valley

the very liordcr of Hipparclms. This mountaui-mass rises from the W. foot
of IV A^ 1^, and culminates in the peak IV A^ ^s^ which is the highest point
in the W. border of Hipparchus. It has upon it a ivliite spot, IV A^ ^7^ j^st

where the rise commences towards Hipparchus. This spot is probably the

small crater given by B. & M. and Lohrmann*^. It presents an appearance

analogous to that of Linne, both on the photogram and as seen in 1867, and

should be watched attentively from time to time. It spreads gradually from

a hrir/Jd centre, and degrades in brilliancy as the valley at the foot of the

mountain-mass is approached. The brightness of IV A^ ^7 scarcely equals

that of Linne on Eutherford's photogram, 1865, March 6.

A mountain-crest ci'osses IVAf^i^ from N".W. to S.E., the N.E. side being

the eye looks along its E.S.E. slope ; but when the rroon is in the opposite part

of her orbit, it is so situated with regard to the eye that the slope is more

readily seen, and probably a portion of it lower than the craterlet maybe

detected. In the latter case it would reaUy be further from the eye ; but the
slope would be seen under a larger angle, while the craterlet wovild by fore-

shortening be seen under a smaller angle ; the difference, however, would be

but slight, and scarcely appreciable by the eye.

the " fault."' It is not a little remarkable that while a rauge of cliffs

somewhat of the same nature as IV A" W.N.W.-E.S.E., No. 1, extends
from IV A^ i3 towards Hoi-rox, the craters IV A^ " and IV A^is with Hor-

M Arox forming its S.E. portion, the crater IV A^-', and the cliffs IV A^*,

IV 10, IV A^ 43, and IV ^ « ^e in the prolongation of IV A" W.N.W.-

E.S.E., No. 1. Does this point to a focus oiuphurst in the neighbourhood

of Horrox, contemporaneous with the fault IVA"" ^i IVA^^o IV A'^^^^ and

marked by the three large openings, Horrox, IV A^ !*, and IV A^ i^ ? If

so, the line of cliffs extending from IV A" ^i to IV A^ ^^ -^ould probably

be more ancient than the " fault," the upburst occurring S. of the line of

cliffs. It is to be remarked that on the line of cliffs a few small craters

only are found, of which IV A" ^ and IV A^ ^ ^re the principal, scarcely

exceeding 8" in diameter, and at a considerable distance from each other.

M,In describing the fault (see letterpress, areas IV A'', IV  p. 20, and Ee-

port. Brit. Assoc. 1866, p. 256), we suggested that it might be more recent

than the " ray from Tycho," on which the steep and rugged W. border of

Albater/niiis occurs. On the parallel ray to the E. we noticed two points of

upburst, one near IV Af ^s, the other near IV A^ ^2 (-ggg letterpress, areas

IV A% IV A^, p. 39, and Eeport Brit. Assoc. 1866, p. 275), the activity of

which might be more ancient than that of IV A'' ^. Should these considera-

tions at aU approximate to the truth, then we have a probable recent epoch

for the production of the group of craters near the W. portion of Hipparchiis.

The close similarity, both in form and direction, of the valleys IV A" ^2 and

IV A'' 18 on opposite sides of Hipj^u^'f^ius also points to the priority of age of

the line of cliffs in which IV A" -^2 occurs, as compared with the floor of Hip-

parcJius, which appears to be more recent.

   This valley is interrupted but not obliterated by the fault IV A" " IV A^ 20
IV A" 72. _^t first, in the neighboiu'hood of IV A" 'f^, it is wide ; but as the
fault is approached it becomes much narrower. The W. side of the crateri-

form depression IV A^ i^ appears to be part of the W. slope of this valley, on
which the E. rim of the crater IV A^ ^ has protruded, which indicates a more

recent epoch for the production of IV A^ i'. Beyond the group connecting
IV A^ 11 ^ith IV A^ 16, the valley IV A" ".IV A^ si can be traced as a narrow

darlc cleft through the ascent to the bright spot IV A^ 37. This cleft is not in

   This spot sliould be assiduously -watched. The spot IV Ai ^^ TV A" ^"', de-
scribed in letterpress to areas lY A", IV AC, pp. 15 and 26, and Keport

Brit. Assoc. 1866, pp. 251 and 262, as a bright spot, has been seen by the

--author and by the Eev. W. 0. Williams as a crater on one occasion (Oct. 18,

1867) by Mr. Williams conspicuously so with a central cone casting a shadow.
In the December lunation Mr. Williams was unable to detect any trace of
a crater ; but on January 3, 1868, the succeeding lunation, Mr. Baxendell saw

Ait as a shallow crater about | of the diameter of IV "^ ^. Mr. Williams has

steadily continued his observations on this spot, from 1867, Oct. 7, to 1868,

May 7, which I have arranged iu the order of the sun's altitude above it
and as this arrangement illustrates the use of the Table on pp. 10, 11, it may
be wcU to introduce it here, both as an example of referring observations to

solar altitudes, and also as indicative of the changes of appearance dependent

ou the angle of illumination.

(
30 iiEPOBT-- 1868.

   The desideratum connected with spots of this nature is not so much the detec-

tion of physical change as the exact determination of the value or extent of
apparent change dependent upon variations of distance, libration, and angle of

ilLuminatiou ; for until such determinations are reduced to numerical values, we

are not in a position to decide wpon the absolute ^a-i^y o^ such objects ; nor can

we be certain that there is more than apparent change until a large number of

observations are discussed with especial reference to the elements above named.

   The Eev. T. W. Webb, in contrasting his seeings of Eratosthenes with the

description of that crater by Beer and Miidler in ' Der Mond,' has the following
very important remarks. Speaking of the appearance which Eratosthenes pre-

sented on the evening of Nov. 8, 1867, he says, " Eratosthenes now all in local

coloiu'; from point of junction oi Apennines round the E. semicircle, the out-
side glacis of wall shows a curious dark-grey border. This is penetrated in two
places by the streaks of Copernicus, which extend perhaps across Eratosthenes
 itself. Curious as to chronological sequence ... It is just possible, however,"

Mr. Webb continues, " that some process affecting the reflective power of the
surface may at this time be working here ; for B. & M. say that this crater is
'in full moon not very distinct'* : we only see a very undefined faint light
spot in a vicinity almost equally luminous. No mention is made of any

darker portions, or of their being so situated as to indicate the position of the
ring ; and the description certainly does not tally well with present appearances.
This is a peculiarly suitable spot for examrning the question whether the Full-

moon marlcings are unchangeable. Fixity, of coiu'se, if established by a long
course of observation here, or anywhere else, would be no argument for its
universal jirevalence, since a state of quiescence in this respect might be attained

at very different epochs in different regions ; but should the reverse be clearly
ascertained in a single well-marked, even though minute, case, it need not be

mentioned that one distinct, incontrovertible affirmation weighs down any

--number of negative instances, and merely throws back the date of their change

to a prehistoric period." Intellectual Observer, vol. xii. pp. 435, 436.

     This "fanlt" is the westernmost of if/jj-ee that are nearly parallel and equi-

 distant, viz. IV A^ -12, IV A^ 51^ and IV A^ 20. These agree more or less in the

 steeper escarpments of the mountains found on them facing the E.S.E., their

 general direction being S.S.W.-IN'.N'.E. Of the three, the faidt IV A""
 IVA^2o IV A" 72 (see letterpress, areas IV A", IV Af, p. 19, and Eeport

 Erit. Assoc. 1866, p. 255) is the longest and most distinctly marked as well as

 the easternmost. It is situated on the W. border of Hipjiarclius, and sepa-

 rates an elevated from a depressed tract of surface. If the parallelism of these

 faults points to a contemporaneity of origin, may we not recognize here the

 simultaneous operation of the upheaving force over a comparatively large

 area ? It may be remarked, in connexion with this suggestion, that the two

 mountain-ranges forming the S.S.W. and N.N.E. boundaries of the depressed

portion E.S.E. of the main fault IV A" " IVA^^o IVA"'^ i^ave their steep

 escarpments towards depressed surfaces.

    With regard to the comparative ages of these faults, we have already sug-
gested (letterpress, areas IV A", IV Af p. 20, and Report Brit. Assoc. 1866,
p. 256) that the fault IV A"" IVA^2o IYA"72 fg more recent than the

 '· ray from Tycho " which it intersects ; this suggestion is founded upon the

fact that the "fault" is continuous throughout, but the "ray" is interrupted

 at the point of intersection.

 not occupy the position which Lohrmann assigns it. IV A^ 54 occupies the
 position of the X. end of Lohr-nann's 63, Sec. I. Lohrmann appears to be in

   This fault is nearly coincident with the "ray from Tycho " on which

Bessel is situated. It takes its rise on the E. border of Hind, and passes, but

does not obliterate, the narrow valley IV A*" i*. Erom the S.AV. end of the

valley IV A"" '^, which is on the lower level E.N'.E. of the fault, to the long

After grazing the W. wall of IVA^i^, the fault IV A" 23 IVA^«2 passes

onward by the W. wall of the depression IV A^ 1^, just "W. of the crater

   » It lias been decided, upon mature consideration, to substitute the term "cleft" for
"rill" as being more significant and comprehensive. It may bo important to mention

that a "cleft" differs from a "fault" in one essential particular; for example, a "fault"

marks a line of dislocation, which in some instances is characterized by an elevation of the
surface on one side, and a depression on the other ivithout jtracnting the appearance of a
crack or narrow valk?/. In other eases, long narrow depressions may be found, mostly in

lines of fault, and often in the same line with cliffs which have been upheaved probably by
the same agency, and near the same epoch at which the narrow valley or " cleft" has been

produced. Tlie term "fault" is consequently employed to signify the residt of a force

apparcntli/ acting in many instances more or less in radial lines from a centre or focus of
disturbance, such as Tycho, from winch numerous lines of "ftiult" diverge (see Report
Brit. Assoc. 1847, p. 61), while the term " cleft " is used to signify a partial result only, and

one which has been manifested in depression as contradistinguished from elevation. (See
'Intellectual Observer,' No. LXVII. August 1867, vol. xii. p. 52 ct scq. for some interest-

ing remarks on Lunar Clefts by the Eev. T. W. Webb.)
   It may be well here to quote Sir C. Lyeil'.s definition of a "fault" as used in geologi-

cal language, ' Principles of Geology.' ninth edition, 1853, (Glossary) p. 805. " Fault, in
the language of miners, is the sudden interruption of the continuity of strata in the same
plane, accompanied by a crack or fissure varying in width from a mere line to several

feet."

    It is clear that the signification of the term " fault," as applied to the moon, cannot be of
precisely the same nature as when it is used in geology; for we cannot observe " faults "of
this kind. Nevertheless the general principle holds good, viz. the elevation or depres.sion
of the surface plane on one side of the Lunar line of faxdt. It has been recognized as a
peculiarity of geological " faults," that the higher portions of the dislocated beds are
usually on the sides towards wliich the " faults" incline in ascending (Eeport Brit. Assoc.

1847, p. 62), so that the ends of the raised strata jiresent steep escarpments towards the

--depressed portions phenomena of frequent occurrence on the moon's surface. In the

areas already mapped, we have the esearj)ments of the cliffs facing the lower level IV A"^ ",

cipitous E. face of the mountain IV A^ * appears to have been produced hj

this fault.

   G3. The N. part of the fault IV A" 35 IVA^e-^ Direction N. by W.-S.

hyE.

    This fault appears to have originated in connexion with the outburst which

jH-oduced the crater IV A" -, as it forms one of a system of faults Jf . and 8.

of that hght-centre (see fig. 1, ante p. 13). This fault, ou the IN", of IV A'' ^, is
first apparent in the mountain -chain IV A'' i-, which is situated on it. From
this mountain-chain the faults IV A"" ^^ and IV A'' 35 diverge. The course of
IV A'' 11 is described in letterpress, areas IV A"^, IV A?, pp. 19, 20, andEeport
Brit. Assoc. 180(3, pp. 255, 256. IV A'' 35 IV A^ «3 passes along the W. range
of IV A" 12 to the W. wall of IV A^ is, where it intersects the faults IV A" 2^,
IV A^ 62^ on the " ray from Tycho." It then passes along the range on which
IV A'^ ^ is situated, where it intersects the fault IV A*^ 5i_ j^ next j^asscs
through IV A^ ^^ to the "W. border of IV A^ -i^, where it intersects the fault
IV A^ ^, and is traced still more northerly through the mountain I A^ 3i

(Lohr. Sec. I. 65) towards Manilius.

The evidence of the more recent origin of this fault than the "ray from

Tycho," as compared with that of "^the fault IV A"" IVA^so IV A"--'

(see letterpress, areas IV A", IV A?, p. 20, and Report Brit. Assoc. 1866, p.

256), is not so striking as in that instance. There does not appear at the

point of intersection to be any breaking through of the fault IV A"" 23

IV A^ «2 \)j the fault IV A" 35 IV A^ «3 . and therefore it is not so easy to
determine whether IV A'' 35 IV A^ ''3 be posterior to the ray from Tycho and

contemporaneous with IV A""!! IVA^2o IV A" ''2, or othe"wise. There can,

however, be very little doubt of its connexion with the crater IV A"" 2, aud

that it forms one of a system of " faults " of which that crater is the centre.

  64. A mountain-peak at the S. end of IVA^35 on the Line of fault

IV A" 35 IVA^63.

  A65. shaUow crater W. of IV A^ i^. on the line of fault IV A" 35 ly A^ 63.

  This crater is shown by B. & M. but not by Lohrmann. B. & M. give a
Acrater between IV A^ ·'5 and IV ^ 21^ which is in Lohrmann, and on Ituther-

ford's photogram, 1865, March 6, appears to be the Ti.E. angle of the depres-

sion  IV  A^ IS  (see  IV  A^  i^)            IV A^ ^s appears  to be  shallow,  and is  situated  on

a mountain-mass which is nearly in the line of fault IV A^5i_ "SS^iHi a morning

terminator past Copernicus, the shadow, which is scarcely discernible, measures

2""7; the longest diameter =:6"*71 ; therefore the proportion of shadow to

iUurainated interior is as 1 to 1-483. It is noteworthy that IV A^ ''5^ jy _^p 15^

and IV A^ 21 are similarly situated with regard to the mountains on which

they are opened ; all three are near faults, and all are suggestive of the

exertion of a force by which the masses on which they occur were thrown

towards S.S.E., the direction of the faults in this neighbourhood coincident
with the " rays from Tycho."

  A*69. shallow depression E. of IVAf^'o, probably 58 of Lobrmann's

Sec. I.

   Lolirmaun appears not to have made the distinction between this depres-
sion and the plain that extends eastward from it, as far as the mountains

XV A^« IVA^s^ and IV A^*;^ but has given between IV A^TM and these

mountains a smooth plain. The depression IV A^ "J^ is well marked in

Rutherford's photogram.

  A*70. mountain-range in the chain that extends from the junction of

Ftolemceus and AJplionsus to and beyond IVA^'^i. This range "forks"
into two small branches at the S. end. Length of crest from N. end to fork
6"-71, from fork to S.E. end 4"-01, from fork to S.W. end 7"-18.

   71. The depression enclosed by IV A^ i9, IVA^^t, IVA/^ss, IV A^^'^^
IV A^ 18^ lY ^,8 33^ and IV A^ -'i^ ij is i^ot shown by Lohrmann as a de-

pression.

    This depression is situated in so yery interesting a group of objects, the

S. part of which occurs in area IV AP, that, anticipating to some extent a
notice of the objects in that area, it may be well to describe the group

in this place.

   This group consists of IV A" 6, IVA''i-\ IV A" is, IV A" 21, the partly
enclosed surface IV A" ''2, with the valley IV A" n, and the mountains
IV A" 20, IV A" 30, IV A" 33, and IVA''3i. Were these objects in a level
portion of the moon, IV A'' 32 -svould present the aspect of a depression partly
surrounded by mountains. As it is, it has greatly the appearance of one of

those partially destroyed craters which are met with on the borders of the
Maria ; and it is not a little remarkable that the mountainous boundary ends
abruptly both on the S.E. and N.W. at the line of cliffs in the chain from
the junction of Ftolemceus and Alplionsus to and beyond IVA^^i, tj^(, pQj._

tion S.E. of the valley IVA""!! facing the depressed surface oi HipparcJius.

There is not the slightest indication of a complete boundary having existed

at any anterior epoch similar to IV A.i ss (see letterpress, areas IV A", IV Ai,

p. 27, and lleport Brit. Assoc. 1866, p. 263) ; indeed the mountains are
scarcely disposed in the segment of a ring. The object which presents

the nearest analogy to IV A" 32 is IV A" 10 ; and it is noteworthy that the

southern mountainous boundaries of both are curved, the convexities being

towards the S. ; and both are traversed by vaUeys running in the same

direction. IVA''32, as it is seen on Rutherford's photogram, and also on the
moon, is very individualized ; it forms, however, only part of a larger forma-

tion, which is not the less well and distinctly marked. Among the remaining
objects are IV A^*^, IV A^35, and IV A^3o, three mountains in a line with
IV A" 12, IV A" 13, and IV A" 21, but separated from them by the plateau or
slope IV A^ 6s_ Together these mountains form the W. wall of the larger
formation, the N". boundary of which consists of the low N.N.W. wall of the

depression IVA^is, and the N'.E. foot of the mountain IVA^«; the E.S.E.

 boundary consists of the cliffs bordering Hipparclms on the W.IS'.W., of

 which the highest point is IV A^ 3S_
    The striking peculiarities of this formation are the depression IV A'' 32 at

 its S. end, and the elevated boss filling IV A^ i® at its N". end ; so that there
is a gradual slope from N. to S. Two craters are opened upon it, IV A^^ i9
 and IV A3 2i_ iv A^ 21 ^g peculiarly situated, as if the northern mass had
 been heaved forwards towards the S.E. The faults IV A'' " IV A^ 20 iv A"" "'^
 and IV A" 23 IV A^ «2 include a great portion of this formation, which is

 traversed by the " ray from Tycho " on which Bessel is situated. This

 " ray " passes close to IV A^ i^, which is situated on its E.N.E. slope.

The interior of this depression appears as a iv7dte spot on Eutherford's pho-

the Crossley equatorial of 7-3 inches aperture, and saw it as a round craterlet

with interior shadow of about -33, diameter of craterlet=l. It was slightly

larger than IV A^"^ and is the eleventh in order on IV A^. On May 2^

1^ 45" G. M.T. it exhibited some approximation to the class of " light-centres "

(see Eeport Brit. Assoc. 1866, p. 218). I have also recorded that in 1868, on

March 31^1 8"^ 30" G. M. T., and May 30'i 10" 20" G. M. T., it was seen as a

Tliis " cleft," which is visible on Eutherford's photogram, appears

either to have broken through the S. border of Horrox or to have originated

there ; the almost rectilinear S.W. part of the rim of Horrox ends ahruptJy at

the point where the " cleft '' cuts it. The cleft has not affected IV A^ ^'^, but

reappears in the high land on W.its side, passes through the depression

IV A^ "'^, and opens out beyond the mountain IV A^ ^^, the S. end of which

is thrust forward in the direction of the line of " cleft " into the valley

IVA^72^ and is traced stiH further between IV A^ 83 and IV A^ «'\ The

objects above specified are among the faintest on the moon's disk. If

the surfaces E. and W. of the fault IV A"" IVA^2o IV A" 72 were con-

tinuous at the time of the i^roduction of the " deft,^' and the " cleft,"

when formed, cut through the rim of Horrox, we might be able to infer that

the date of Horroxvras anterior to the dates of the " cleft," fault, and craters

IV A^ 19^ lY ^^ 21^ and that the period of upheaval of the high land forming

theW. border oi Hipparchus was posterior to the epoch of the production of the

W. floor of Hipparchus. The character of IV A^ ^'^, combined with the

absence of any trace of the "cleft" upon the crater, strongly indicates the

posteriority of IV A^ i^ ; and this, taken in connexion with the probable recent
date of the fault IV A" " IV A^ 20 ly A" "''^ tends to establish that the con-

formation of the features in this part of the lunar surface is of more recent

origin than the system of " rays " from Tycho.

    II.--ADDITIONS TO AEEAS IV A", IV A^, AND IV Af, WITH

         IDENTIFICATIONS OF OBJECTS IN THESE AREAS.

   The requirements of selenographical research render it necessary that con-
siderable attention should be given to the discovery of new objects not yet

inserted in maps or catalogues, as wcU as the identification of those already

recorded. If " fixity " is to be established or " change " detected, in either
case it must be by constant and systematic observation, the only means by

which the invarlahlc character of an object may be ascertained and apparent
changes eliminated, or by which it may be discovered that changes which

seem to be only apparent are of such a nature as to lead to the suspicion,
and, if well founded, the ultimate detection of real change. The objects re-

corded in Areas IV A", IV A'^, and IV Af are mostly taken from Eutherford's
photogram, 1865, March 6, and are consequently brought up to that date.
In a few cases the dates are later. The identification of objects fixes their
characters to the dates of observation, which in those of Areas IV A" and
IV A? are mostly in the autumn of 1867. Those of IV A^ are in the 8j)ring
of 1868, some being as late as November 5, 1868.

under date of 1868, Feb. 1, he says, " The lower part of IV A" '^^, or the foot
of the ridge, always looks to me like a sort of continuation of the cleft IV A" ^"i,

diameter 2"-0, mag. 0-12.

   It is recorded as sketched on map 1867, April 11, and was afterwards seen
1807, May 11, with the Royal Society's 4^-inch achromatic, power 230. It
is shown by B. & M.

   The Rev. W. 0, Williams ascertained in October 18G7 that the moimtaiu-
range IV Ai -^^ presented the form of a stem with two branches in the form
of a " fork." Restricting the designation IV Ai '*s to the northern part or
stem, we have :

   116. The east branch of IV A^^s from the fork.
    117. The west branch of IV AC 'i^ from the fork.
   118. The valley between IV A^ "S and IV Ai i".
   These objects were discovered independently by the Rev, W. 0. Williams

and Herbert Ingall, Esq., on October 18, 1867.

    119. The depressed surface between IV Af land IV A? ''^j with which the
valley IV Ai -^ communicates.

   The lunar objects to which the above designating numbers in each area are
appended have been examined since the construction of the maps of the areas,
and may be regarded as testifying to the character of each object as it ex-
isted at the time of examination, which in most cases agree with the descrip-

tion in the catalogue.

                III.--LINNE.

Observations of this object continue to be made by gentlemen in concert

with the Committee. In the last Report (Eeport, 1867, pp. 3 to 24) three

essential features were described, viz. a large shallow crater, containing

within it a small crater, both being replaced by a large ill-defined white

spot under an increase of solar altitude. On the 26th of June 1868 Linne

was observed under very favourable circumstances by Messrs. Huggins, Pen-

rose, Birt, Webb, Carpenter, Joynson, and Williams, from 8.30 to 11.30

G.M.T. During the earlier observations nothing was seen but a small cone,

which cast a shadow to the east. This cone was not situated upon a ridge,

the sixth of Schroter, as he states his spot v to be (see post, p. 44, and

Eeport, 1867, p. 4), but appeared as if isolated, standing upon a slightly
raised portion of the Mare Serenitatis, having Schroter's sixth ridge to the

south, the cone being in the line of prolongation of this ridge to the north.

On the west a curvilinear ridge of lower altitude (given by Beer and Madler)

was seen, from the east foot of which the surface rose very slightly to the

base of the cone. There was not the slightest indication of a shallow crater,

nor was there the least appearance in the surface around the cone which

might be considered indicative of its becoming a white spot, as the sun rose

above it. The terminator was a little east of the cone, and the next ridge

beyond the cone towards the east was becoming visible.

Mr. Carpenter was the only observer who saw on the cone the crater-

opening. From the drawings and descriptions of this object, it would appear

to be very similar to a terrestrial volcanic cone, the eastera side being broken

do'mi. Messrs. Joynson and Williams record the cone as " a bright point,"

an appearance it would present in telescopes of smaller aperture than those

in which it was seen as a cone with crater-opening.

During the earlier period of the observations the altitude of the sun was

less than 1°, but as it became higher a change was observed, which wiU be

described presently. The great importance of determining the true natui'e

of this change is obvious. Was it actual, or was it optical ? So far as the

observations from 1866 (Oct. 16) to 1868 (Sept. 7) testify, this change takes

place, more or less constantly, with loiu solar altitudes (see j^ost, p. 45, points
of contrast 7th and 8th). It is consequently of importance to ascertain by

future observation whether the transition from the visibility of the lunar

surface to that of a white spot, by or in which the character of the surface

is no longer rendered apparent, is constant for solar altitudes and azi-

muths of the same value. If the change be purely optical and dependent

upon the two oonditions following, viz. the nature of the lunar surface on

the one hand, and the incidence of the solar rays on the other, as soon as

the sun attains the requisite altitude and azimuth, the altered appearance

supervenes : but if the surface itself sliould at any time be altered so that
with the same incidence of the sun's rays the former altered appearance

should be no longer observed, the change, of whatever nature it may be,

could not in that case be referred to a purely optical source, some real
change, either of a temporary or lasting character, must have transpired.
^VTiile the change about to be described is constant for constant solar alti-
tudes and azimuths, the question whether it is purely optical, or whether it
is connected with a temporary but real diurnal change cannot be resolved ;
but as soon as the character of the surface, as seen at sunrise and sunset, is
also clearly perceptible with solar altitudes Mr/her than those at which the

white spot now appears and disappears, the phenomenon is at once removed

--from the category of optical to that of real change, it may be temporary as

referred to the luni-solar day, or of a more lasting nature if the surface
itself should undergo a physical change. This will to a great extent pre-
clude the expression of opinion, which is generally founded more or less on
insufficient evidence ; observation alone can guide us to a safe conclusion
in connexion with the questions raised on Linne. WhSla refraining from

expressing an opinion, we ought not to relax in collecting, arranging, and
discussing evidence, as the only means by which we can obtain such an
acquaintance with the phenomena of the moon's surface as may enable us

finally to dispose of such questions as are at present agitated respecting them.

The change above alluded to is best elucidated by the following records of

observation.

   The first notice of change occurs in the following extracts from Mr. Birt's

note-book :
    " 10.30. During the last half-hour a decided change has occurred in the

appearance of Linne * * * The cone is no longer visible, nor the shadow, but
a somewhat bright white spot, larger than IE** ^ [the southern of the three

Wcraters to the N.W.], and nearly as large as I i" [the middle of the three

craters].

    I have received from Mr. Gorton a drawing of Linne made by Mr. Wil-
liams of Liverpool, on the evening of June 26, at 11 p.m., in which Linne is

represented as a white spot. This diff'ers so very materially from the earlier
observations that a correspondence ensued, of which the following is the

result :

    " Although the drawings [Mr. Huggins's, Mr. Carpenter's, and Mr. "Wil-
liams's] were made on the same evening, and differ amongst themselves,
there docs not appear to be any contradiction. Some observers saw the cone,
another the opening, and others the bright white spot, the formation of wliich
appears to have been actually witnessed. Mr. Joynson places the observa-

tions of Mr. Bii-t and those of Mr. Williams in conjunction with his own in

juxtaposition, thus :

    Mr. Joynson adds, " I think it is quite clear that the cone or bright point
gradually took the aspect of a spot, and as it enlarged it became duller and

flatter."

   The transition, to which allusion has been made, was seen on the eveuino-
of the 26th of June by thi-ee observers.

   The next favourable opportunity for seeing Linne near the terminator
occurred on the 24th of August 1868. The following is a record of observa-
tions by Mr. Walker, of Teignmouth :

" 1868, August 24'' 7^ 45"". Linne: crater on the top of a gently rising

ground (conical shape),  wall to right (east)  in  stronger illumination                                                                                                            below
                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

to left appearance of depression. Definition good. Could not make out any

thing inside the crater ; crater looked clean ; no appearance of white cloud or

haze."

    Subsequently Mr. Walker furnished the following explanation :
    " The gently rising ground I spoke of was exterior to Linne, nothing of

the interior or floor of which was visible, the iUumination not being yet high

enough. By a conical shape (not a well- chosen phrase) I meant that the

ground rose in aU directions around Linne, which thus presented the aspect of

a shallow crater on the summit of a rising ground. The impression of shal-
lowness was conveyed by the thinness of the illuminated circuit of the cra-
ter, and I think also by the shade of darkness of the interior of the crater.
Of the cone I saw nothing."

   Mr. Walker's observation very fairly agrees with those made on June 26.
The rising groimd appears to be the surface between the ridges upon which
the cone or crater is situated. Mr. Walker speaks of the thinness of the cir-

cuit [Qy. rim] of the crater, from which he inferred that it was shallow ; he is
decisive upon the absence of the white cloud or spot.

   Under the evening-iUumination of the same luni-solar day, on Sept. 7,
1868, 11.30 to 12.0 L.M.T., Maresfield, Sussex, Capt. Noble recorded the

following observation :

   " With powers of 154, 255, and 394, Linne, which is now tolerably near

the terminator, suggests the idea of being a mammiUarifbrm object. I some-
times seem to glimpse a darker (though by no means black) spot near the
middle of it, giving it the aspect of a thick ring ; but as the shading is in the

opposite side to the sun, and is moreover faint, it is just possible that it may

be the result of the convexity of this wonderful object."

   Two hours later, viz. Sept. 7, 1868, 14'^, Mr. Walker, of Teignmouth, re-

corded as follows :

   " Endoxus on terminator. Linne. Hill on east side of the crater bright.

Crater dark inside. Curved ridge, N.W. cut by the terminator. Two other

ridges S., the east one sweeping up to Sulpicius Gallus, which was very
marked, round, and has higher walls than Linne, which is rather the larger
perhaps of the two, and oval-shaped. Fancied the hill or elevated portion of
the crater E. had a crater on it."

    Mr. Walker's observation is accompanied by a sketch, from which it ap-
pears that the portion designated as the crater is the surface between the
ridges, the rising ground of the morning illumination, and that the hiU on
the east is the cone on which Mr. Walker thought he saw a crater (the cra-
ter-opening) ; this hiU occupies the precise position of the cone in the observa-
tions of June 26.

   The observations of Mr. Walker and Capt. Noble, on Sept. 7, bear the same

relation to each other as the earlier observations on June 26 do to the ob-
servation of Messrs. Joynson and Williams on the same evening. In one

case we have the topographical features of the district near Linne replaced

by the white spot ; in the other the white spot is first seen, but in a short

time it has disappeared, and the features of the district have become visible.

                                                                           e2
:

--44 REPORT 1868.

The change to and from the white spot in each case is well marked ; and it
now remains to ascertain if this change always takes place with the same
solar altitudes and azimiaths. To observe the topographical features and

witness the transition, it is necessary that Linne should be very near the

terminator.

 --Herr von Madlor has obligingly communicated the following memorandum

respecting Linne

   " The insrument I made iise of to produce drawings of the moon was a
refractor of 3| feet of focal length and 43 lines of aperture. Commonly I
employed a magnifying-power of 300, but the trigonometrical measurements
have been executed with a magnifying-power of 120, which allowed me to

reach to the edge of the moon."

   "Respecting the crater Linne, it was a principal point in my trigonometri-

cal network, and consequently I have observed it very often.

" I remember that this crater did occupy the greatest part of the diameter

of the circular wall, so that if a 6 extended over 1-4 Ger-

man mile (6-4 English), a' b' was at least 0-9.                    /^         -x\

    " I have never seen any real change, only optical ones.     ^/ /^r         jN j'·,
   " Only in or near the full moon it was a white spot, almost
as white in the middle as on the edges ; these edges were         \'\             jj

                                                                      '··./-  ---/''

not wholly distinct, but always circular and fit for measure-

ment.

   " The deepness of the crater must have been considerable ; for I have
found an interior shadow when the sun had attained an altitude of 30°. I

have never seen a central mountain in the interior.

   Without expressing the slightest opinion on the questions of change or
fixity derived from a comparison of the above with recent observations, it

may be permissible to notice the points of contrast between the earlier and

more recent observations of Linne which the statements of the Baron Madler

afford. Such a comparison and contrast is essential if we desire to arrive at
a true conclusion. The following appear to be the most important.

 --Points of contrast between earlier delineations and recent observations of

the lunar crater Linne :
   1st. The earliest authentic delineations and records of Linne represent this

object as a crater, assign to it a diameter of about six English miles, and
speak of it as being very deep.

    2nd. Kecent observations, i. e. from 1866, Oct. 16, to 1868, Sept. 7, are
decisive as to the existence of a small cone, with crater-opening on the por-
tion of the Mare Sereniiatis surrounded by ridges.

    3rd. It has been assumed that the white spot v in Schroter's Tafel ix.
represents Linne as seen on Nov. 5, 1788, and that its present state is

nearly similar.
    4tli. Capt. Noble pointed out,^at a Meeting of the Eoyal Astronomical So-

ciety, that a line drawn from Plinius through Bessel will fall on Linne. This
line on Schroter's drawing falls very nearly on the dark spot, which is
very unlike the appearance of Linne at present.

    5th. Herr von Madler has \eTj recently recorded that in 1831 the crater-
opening occupied 0-9 of the diameter of the external wall, which measured
about 6-4 miles English.

    6th. The diameter of the base of the cone recently observed is less than
three English mUes, and the crater-opening still smaller.
                               --

ON Kent's cavern, Devonshire.  45

   7th. In the year 1831 {authority Herr von Miidler) the white spot was
seen only near the time of full moon, almost as white in the middle as at the

edges.

    8th. In the years 1867 and 1868 the white spot appeared shortly after
sunrise and disappeared a little before sunset, and was frequently observed
to have a brighter nucleus, instead of being almost as white in the middle as

at the edges.

   9th. In the year 1831 {authority Herr von Madler) the interior shadow
was perceptible imtil the sun attained an altitude of 30°.

   10th. In the years 1867 andl868 the small crater-opening has been seen as
a smaE. black spot, rather west of the centre of the white spot, long after
the terminator has passed Linne, but the usual interior crater-shadow has
not been seen except with comparative low solar altitudes.

Fourth Report of the Committee for Exploring Kent's Cavern, Devon-
   shire. The Committee consistinff of Sir Charles Lyell, Bart.,

   Professor Phillips, Sir John Lubbock, Bad., Mr. John Evans,
   Mr. Edward Vivian, Mr. George Busk, and Mr. William Pen-

    GELLY (Reporter).

In their Third Report, presented to the Association in 1867, the Committee
stated that the Cavern consists of two parallel series of chambers and gal-
leries, having, approximately, a north and south direction ; that their re-
searches had been confined to the Eastern Series, in which the North-east
Gallery, the Vestibule, the Passage of Urns, the Great Chamber, and the
Gallery had been completely explored to the depth of 4 feet below the base
of the Stalagmitic Floor ; that the investigation of the Lecture Hall had been

begun, but that the greater part of it, as weU as the entire South-western
Chamber and the North and South " Sally Ports," remained untouched.

   The year 1867-68 has been devoted to the Lecture Hall and South-west
Chamber. The exploration of the former has been completed, and, so far as
an estimate can at present be formed, the latter will have been thoroughly
investigated in about two months from the present time. There is, however,
some iincertainty on this question, since the further end of this Chamber is
now closed with an enormous accumulation of stalagmite ; and it is not im-

probable that when this is removed the apartment may prove to be much

larger than is at present supposed. The Superintendents of the work incline
to the opinion that a gallery will sooner or later be laid open here, which
wiU lead into the Western Series of Chambers and Galleries. There is at
present but one known channel of communication between the two series
that leading westward out of the Vestibule, near the opposite or northern
end of the Cavern.

   The Committee continue to follow the mode of exploration laid down at
the commencement of the work, and described in detail in their First Report,
presented in 1865. The deposits are excavated in successive foot-parallels,
and each parallel is removed in foot-levels, to the depth of 4 feet beneath

the lower surface of the Stalagmitic Floor. In no instance has anything like
a continuous hmestone bottom of the Cavern been reached ; but a depth
greater than 4 feet would be incompatible with convenient, economical, tmst-
worthy working, as it would be necessary to be continually putting up and

taking down scaifolding or working-platforms, and there would be a great
liability for the deposit to " cave in," which, by rendering it impossible to
determine their exact positions and associations, woiild deprive the objects
found of much of their interest, as weU as of their value as evidence.

   The workmen still foUow the practice of first examining the deposits in
situ, and of re-examining them by dayhght at the entrance of the Cavern
the lines described in the First Eeport (1865) are still employed in

order to fix the precise position of every object found; the specimens, as at
the beginning, are all carefully cleaned and labelled, those fouud in each
" yard" (mass of deposit a yard long and a foot square in the section) are
kept together in a separate box ; the Cavern is visited daily by the Superin-

tendents ; the Secretary continues to keep a daily journal of the work ; Re-
ports, signed by both Superintendents, are, at the end of each month, for-
warded to Sir C. Lyell, Chairman of the Committee ; and well-defined and
satisfactory arrangements exist for the admission of visitors accompanied by
the Superintendents, so as at once to keep alive a healthy interest in the
exploration and to prevent inconvenience from their visits.

   Amongst the niimerous visitors during the past year, the Superintendents
had the pleasure of receiving Dr. Hooker, President of the British Associa-

--tion.
    The Lecture Hall. In their Third Report (1867), the Committee stated
that researches, probably on a somewhat large scale, had been carried on in
the Lecture Hall by Mr. M'Enery and the other early explorers, who, in-
stead of taking out of the Cavern that portion of the deposits which they
had examined, simply threw it on one side. On the removal of this dislodged
material, the Committee found that they had considerably over-estimated the
extent of the old working, and that by far the greater portion of the deposits
in this Hall remained indubitably intact.

   The objects met with, not only in the broken ground, but in every locality
about which tliere was the least uncertainty, were carefully kept distinct
from those found in undoubted virgin soil.

   Without at present entering into details, it may be stated that in the Lec-

ture Hall the deposits were of the same general character and order as in

--those parts of the Cavern which the Committee had previously explored and

reported on, Red Cave-earth of unknown depth, completely sealed up with
a Stalagmitic Floor, which, in its turn, was covered with a layer of Black

Mould.
   The objects found in the overlying Black Mould were less numerous than,

but similar to, those described from the same accumulation in former Reports.

Amongst them may be mentioned several pieces of pottery, a spindle-whorl,
a roughly shapen piece of New Red Sandstone, a portion of a bone comb,

part of a small vase, a small red earthenware pan, marine shells, a small piece
of smelted copper, the entire lower jaw and an almost complete skull of a

badger, part of a human upper jaw with eight teeth, of which four are still

in their sockets, and the internal cast of a fossil shell.
   The potsherds do not require detailed description, most of them are of

black coarse clay mixed with small stones, some of them are ornamented,
whilst others are plain, and, in short, they closely resemble those described

in the former Reports.

   The spnidle-whorl is of clay-slate, measures an inch in diameter and half
an inch in depth, and is ornamented with a series of curvilineal and straight
lines, both on its curved and flat surfaces. It is, perhaps, worthy of remark
that, though the Cavern has yielded spindle-whorls formed of different kinds
                               ;

ON Kent's cavern, Devonshire.  47

of stone, tlie best made, the most highly finished, and the only ornamented
specimens are fashioned in slate.

   The piece of red sandstone was perhaps a spindle-whorl marred in the
making. Good specimens formed of the same material have been found in
the Cavern in previous years. It is rudely of the required form, about the

size of a rather large whorl, but is imperforate.
   But for the more or less perfect specimens found in former years, it would

not have been easy perhaps to identify the fragment of bone comb. It is

but a portion of what may be called the shaft, both ends having been broken

off. It must have been of the same type as those described in previous lie-
ports, aU of which had their teeth at one end ; but it differs from all those
found. before in being ornamented with well-drilled, small, circular punctures,
which traverse the shaft obliquely in two parallel series, the direction of one

set being at right angles to that of the other.

   The red earthenware vessel is no doubt a pan of the kind used for flower-
pots to stand in, and is clearly modern.

   The marine shells are chiefly those of the Oyster, Cockle, and Pecten.
One of the last has, near its anterior margin, a small elliptical hole, which is

probably artificial.

   The human jaw and teeth may be comparatively modem. They were
submitted to Messrs. Rodway, the eminent dentists of Torquay, who stated

that " several of the alveoli possessed peculiar ii'regularities, which confirm
other unmistakeable evidence that the whole of the teeth belonged to the
same individual ; that the loose teeth were considerably worn away, parti-
cularly the canine, at the end of which is exostosis, which was caused by the
whole, or the greater part, of the mastication of later years being performed

by the canine ; that they were the teeth of an old person, probably a man
and that they w ould be likely or certain to preserve their freshness of aspect

for an indefinite period."
   The cast of the fossil shell is apparently from the Oolite, and was perhaps

lost in the Cavern by some geological tourist just arrived from the neighbour-

ing Jurassic district of Dorsetshire.

   With the exception of the ground broken by the early explorers, which
has been already mentioned, the Stalagmitic Floor was everywhere continu-
ous. It varied from 2 to 32 inches in thickness, but rarely measured less,
and commonly more, than 6 inches. It was generally of granular structure,
but occasionally crystalliue, and sometimes made up of alternate crystalline
and granular layers. It contained numerous blocks of limestone and of old
stalagmite ; the former had no doubt fallen from the roof from time to time,
and some of them measured as much as 4 feet in length. In addition to
such as were completely incorporated in the Floor, there were many, as in
other branches of the Cavern, which were lodged in and rose above it, whilst
others projected from it downwards into the Cave-earth.

    The imbedded masses of stalagmite were invariably of a structure unlike
that of the fioor in which they were lodged. In all cases, they were, at
once, finely laminated and highly crystalline, the latter character being dis-
played in a columnar or fibrous structure at right angles to the laminae, whe-
ther the latter were plane or curvilinear. In some cases, these blocks, like
those of limestone just mentioned, projected above or below the Floor into the
Black Mould or Cave-earth respectively, whilst others were completely in-
vested. It cannot be doubted that they were fragments of an oldei' Floor,
which, as stated in previous Reports, and especially the third (1867), had
been at least partially broken up at a comparatively early period in the
48 REPORT--1868.

Cavern's history. It will be convenient thereforeto speak, in future, of the
floor represented by these blocks as " The Older Floor," and of that which

the Committee found spreading in an unbroken sheet through aU branches of
the Cavern as " The Modern Floor."

As in former years, bones were occasionally found in the Modern Floor of

Stalagmite in the Lecture Hall. Amongst the most important are a fine molar

of Rhinoceros, a premolar of Hyaena, two or three molars of Bear, a large

part of a humerus, probably of Bear, and an os calcis of some large animal.

The teeth of Rhinoceros and Hyaena were found, in the presence of one of

the Superintendents, September 21, 1867, lying together very little below the

upper sm-face of the Stalagmite. Since the tim.es oi Hhinoceros tiehorhinus

and Hyrena spelcea in Devonshire, therefore, the increase of thickness of the

Stalagmitic Floor, in that particular part of the Cavern, has been barely suf-

ficient to cover these interesting relics.

  A few examples of charred wood were found in the same Floor.

 --In most cases, the composition of the Cave-earth was of the ordinary

typical character about equal parts of red loam or clay, and of compara-

tively small angidar fragments of limestone. In this condition it almost in-
variably contained bones, but when there was any marked departure from it,

by either loam or stones being greatly in excess, bones were extremely rare.

In a few instances, the deposit was a mixture of fine earth and sand, resem-

bling ordinary road-washing, and contained no trace of bone.

The Cave-earth contained a considerable number of fragments of Devonian

grit, huge blocks of limestone, large masses of old stah gmite, and loose

lumps of rock-like breccia.

The grit fragments could not have been derived from the Cavern-hiU, but

were probably furnished by neighbouring loftier eminences. They have

assumed subangular or well-rounded forms indicative of the rolling action of

water, but their transportation into the Cavern by this agency would require

that the district should have a surface- configuration very unlike that which

now obtains.

In addition to the grit pebbles, there were found mingled with them sub-

angular and rounded pieces of quartz and flint, and also a small angular piece

of crystalline schist, such as is not found in any part of the Torbay district,

but is characteristic of the southern angle of Devonshire, or what may be

Acalled the Start and Bolt district.  pebble believed to have been derived

from the same locality was mentioned in the Second Report (1866).
   The blocks of limiestone occurred at all levels in the deposit ; they were all

quite angular, and some of them many tons in weight.

   The masses of old stalagmite were of the same structure as those in the

Modem Floor, and were found everywhere in the Cave-earth ; they were

all in the form of huge cuboidal blocks, with sharp unrounded edges. The

Older Floor, of which they are obviously remnants, appears to have been
broken up by being fractured along planes at right and other high angles to
its iipper and lower surfaces. There appears to have been no instance of

division in planes even distantly approaching parallelism to these surfaces.

Many of them contained teeth and bones, all, so far as they were identified,

the remains of the Cave-bear.

   The loose lumps of rock-like breccia were of a more or less rounded form,
and were composed of red earth, angular pieces of limestone, and rounded

and subangular pieces of Devonian grit ; they diff'ered from the Cave-earth

in being invariably cemented together like a firm mass of concrete, and in

containing a considerably greater proportion of fragments of grit. Almost

all of them were crowded with teeth and bones, which, so far as is known,

are those of the Cave-bear. No teeth-marks have been detected on any of
them, nor were there any traces of faecal matter. Many of the canines and

molars were of great size, and some of the former were so much worn as to

suggest that they had belonged to old animals whose molars had become in-

capable of performing their functions.

These lumps of breccia had not the appearance of being portions of the

ordinary Cave-earth agglomerated in situ. Their aspect was rather that of

--remnants of a deposit older than that in which they were incorjjorated, the

deposit, in fact, which the Older Eloor of Stalagmite had covered, and on

which it had been formed. To a large extent, this opinion received confir-

mation in the fact, already mentioned, that the osseous remains in the lumps

of breccia as well as in the blocks of old stalagmite were, at least mainly,

those of the Cave-bear, the other members of the Cave-fauna being iinre-

presented.

The Cave-earth in the Lectui'e Hall contained teeth of Horse, Rhinoceros,

Hyaena, Bear, Fox, Deer, Mammoth, Lion, Ox, and Badger ; their prevalence
being indicated by the order in which their names are given, those of the

Horse being the most, and of the Badger the least abundant. The teeth

were accompanied by a considerable number of bones, many of which were

deeply scored with teeth-marks, others were split longitudinally, and several

were invested with thin films of stalagmite, irrespective of the depth at

--which they were found. These different conditions of the bones are inter-

esting and significant, the first implying the presence of the living hyaena,

the second the operations of man, and the last the slow and intermittent

accumulation of the Cave-earth, since each bone must have lain on what was

the uiyper surface of the deposit for a considerable period, during which it

was exposed to the action of the lime-laden drip from the roof of the Cavern.

The statement, in the Third Report (1867), that faecal matter was met

with almost exclusively in the Great Chamber, requires considerable modifica-

tion. During the year 1867-68 a greater quantity of this material was found

in the Cave-earth, in the Lecture Hall, than had been met with previously

in the adjacent Chamber just spoken of; it occurred at all levels, and some-

times in masses a foot high. Occasionally individual coprolites were en-

cotmtered which had undergone no change either of place or of form since

--they were originally dropped by the hyaena a fact which goes far to show

that the Cave-earth was neither all introduced at one and the same time, nor

by violent agency, such as a great rush of water.

   This branch of the Cavern was not very productive of flint tools, or,
with the exception of split bones, other evidences of human existence.

Omitting mere chips and doubtful flakes, it yielded no more than five imple-

ments, aU of which are very inferior to the fine specimens discovered in

former years. Two of them were found in the first foot-level, two in the

second, and one in the third. One of them is formed of grey cherty flint, of

a kind which the  old  men  of  Kent's Hole frequently employed                                                                                                                                           the others
                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

are of a finer variety, and of the prevalent white colour. They aU belong to

the LanccoJate type of implement. The best of the series is that composed

of chert ; it was found in the fu-st or uppermost fool-level, October 18th,

1867. Its point had been broken off before it was met with. At present it

measures 2-8 inches in length, and 1-3 inch in greatest breadth. There

does not appear to have been much skilled labour expended on it, and its

edges are considerably broken.

50 REPORT--1868.

side into an apartment, which, on account of its position in relation to the
other branches of the Eastern Series, has been termed the " South-west
Chamber." It is at present comparatively small, but, as has been already

remarked, it may prove when completely emptied to be much larger. At

the junction of the two apartments, the space between the opposite walls of
the Cavern is inconsiderable ; and this, before the workmen commenced their

excavations, was much diminished by an enormous mass of limestone which
had fallen from above, and was estimated at upwards of 100 tons. Its base
was buried from two to three feet deep in the Cave-earth, and its summit
reached a height of fully sis feet above the Modern Floor of Stalagmite. On
account of its form it was commonly known as the " Pulpit Rock," but it

not unfrequently received the appellation of the " Lecturer's Rostrum,"

mainly because, when lectures were delivered within the Cavern on its his-

tory and formation, the speaker always took his stand on this rock, his au-
dience being assembled in the adjacent Lecture Hall. The removal of the
Pulpit absorbed a considerable amount of time, but it was quite indis-
pensable in order to the excavation' of the South-west Chamber, the entrance
of which it guarded.

    In the South-west Chamber there was no trace of the overlying Black
Mould. This accumulation had presented itself in every other branch of the
Eastern Series of chambers and galleries, with the single exception of the
inner portion of the Gallery in the western wall of the Great Chamber, where

it gradually thinned out. It covered the entire Floor of the Lecture Hall to
a depth as great as in any other part of the Cavern, but it terminated
abruptly at the Pulpit Rock, and was not resumed southwards.

    In 1846, a Subcommittee of the Torquay Natural-History Society, con-
sisting of Dr. Battersby and the Superintendents of the present work, com-

menced a search in this Chamber, when they broke iip the Modern Floor of
Stalagmite over a rudely circular area about 6 feet in diameter. They ex-

cavated the underlying Cave-earth to the depth of about 2 feet, when, having
found nothing, they abandoned the search, leaving the pit empty and the
materials dug out of it lying in a heap near. Probably no part of the Cavern
is in wet weather more exposed to drip than this ; hence it might have been
expected that here, if anywhere, twenty-two years would have produced a

film of stalagmite of appreciable thickness, especially as it was known that
the Modern Floor attains an average thickness considerably surpassing that
in any other part of the Cavern which the Committee have explored. Yet
not a film was to be found either at the bottom of the pit, on the section
made in digging it, or on the Cave-earth thrown out of it. This remote
part of the Cavern was very rarely entered by visitors, and the operations of
nature went on without check or interference ; but everything was found
precisely as it was left upwards of twenty years ago.

   The form of the South-west Chamber, as well as the huge accumulation
of stalagmite on its western side, rendered it expedient to excavate the de-

--posits it contained in two distinct " Divisions " or series of workings an

eastern and a western, the working direction in the former being southward,
and in the latter westward. The first has been completed, and considerable
pi'ogress has been made in the second.

    With the exception of the ground broken by the Torquay Natiiral-History
Society, the Modern Floor of Stalagmite was everywhere perfectly continuous
throughout this Chamber. In the Eastern Division it averaged 28 inches
in thickness ; in one instance only it wa.s no more than 6 inches ; it was very
seldom so little as a foot, and it several times attained to 5 and even
                                                                                               --

            ON Kent's cavern, Devonshire.                                                                              51

6 feet. Ill its structure it was commonly granular, except at and near

its junction with the walls of the Cavern, where it frequently consisted of

thin crystalline laminae, and was extremely hard and tough. Numerous

angular masses of limestone were found in it, and some of them were of

great size ; hut there were no incorporated blocks of old stalagmite.

In the northernmost or first eight foot-parallels in this Division, the Cave-

earth occupied each entire section, from the bottom of the Modern Stalag-

mitic Floor to the base of the lowest or foui'th foot-level. It was of the

ordinary type, and, like that in every other branch of the Cavern, contained

large blocks of limestone and of old stalagmite, as well as lumps of breccia,

such as had presented themselves in the adjacent Hall.

In the more southerly parallels there was found at the base of the section,

and extending quite across it from end to end, a deposit, in situ, of a new

type, on which the Cave-earth at once rested. This proved to be a rock-

like breccia composed of I'ed earth, angular pieces of limestone, siibangular

and rounded pieces of grit in considerable numbers, blocks of ciystalline

stalagmite, and bones, all cemented into a firm and hard concrete ; in
short, with the single exception of its being undisturbed, it was of precisely

the same character as the loose lumps previously met with in the Lecture

Hall. In each succeeding parallel it rose higher and higher in the section,

the overlying Cave-earth gradually thinning out.

Six feet south of its first appearance, this Breccia was found to be imme-

diately overlaid by a Eloor of Crystalline Stalagmite nearly 2 feet thick,

which separated it from the Cave-earth above ; in short, there were in this
parallel, in the same vertical section, two Floors of Stalagmite, each imme-

diately overlying the accumulation of detritus on which it had been formed.

From this point to the end of the Eastern Division of the Chamber every

parallel disclosed the two Floors ; but with every additional foot southwards,

the intermediate band of Cave-earth became thinner and thinner, until,

before the southern wall was reached, it altogether disappeared, and the

Modern Floor rested at once on the Older one. These two accumulations of

--stalagmite were commonly distinguishable by their different structures, the

upper being granular except when near the waU of the Cavern, the lower

invariably crystalline.

In a few of the southernmost parallels, the materials at the bottom of the

sections were not cemented, and there were but few bones mixed with them.

In all other respects they were identical with the concrete immediately above.

It has been already stated that the Modern Floor of Stalagmite was every-

where continuous. Instead of this being the case with the Older Floor, it

usually extended from each end of the section several feet towards its centre,

but in all cases terminated more or less abruptly, leaving an interspace,
sometimes as much as 7 feet wide.

In this branch of the Cavern, where the conditions were at once so novel

and so variable, the work was watched with the utmost care, and accurate

measurements and descriptions were frequently made. The following sec-

tions from difi'erent parts of the Chamber will show in a general way the

succession of the deposits, in descending order :

The Modern Stalagmitic Floor in this Division of the Chamber, as else-

where in the Cavern, was found to contain a few bones and pieces of charred

wood. Of the former, the most important are part of the upper jaw of the

Cave-bear, containing both canines and two molars, none of which are much

worn. With this fine specimen, which was extracted in the presence of the

two Superintendents, several loose molars of bear were found, and also a claw

of some large carnivore. Besides the foregoing, there were found elsewhere

in this Floor a fine canine of Ursus spelceus, which does not appear to have

seen much service, and an os calcis of some large animal.

The Cave-earth, too, no matter how thin the band to which it had dwin-

dled, continued to the last to yield remains of its characteristic fauna. In

this deposit there were found, in the Division of the Chamber now under

notice, teeth and other relics of Bear, Fox, Horse, Hyaena, Rhinoceros, Mam-

moth, Hare, and bird. The frequency with which they were met with, rather

than the aggregate number of specimens in each case, is indicated by the
order in which the names stand, the remains of Bear being most prevalent,

whilst those of bird were found once only. In the same branch of the Cavern

was found the femur of a Bear, having the distal end perfect, but the proxi-
mal extremity wanting. This is the largest bone found during the present
exploration ; it was lying, with the anterior portions of the two rami of the
lower jaw of a young Hycvna spelcea, in the fourth or lowest foot-level.

   As elsewhere, many of the bones were well scored with teeth-marks, and
some were split lengthways. Lumps of fsecal matter also were occasionally
met with.

  A few flint chips were likewise found. They are probably of artificial

origin, but are not of suflScient value to require description.

Though fragments of stone which the Cavern hill could not have supplied

were much more abundant in the rock-like Breccia than in the Cave-earth,
none of them were of very distant derivation : no pieces of granite fi-om

Dartmoor, or of crystalline schist from the Start and Bolt, or even of slate
from the more immediate neighbourhood, all of which have been found in

the Cave- earth.

   The Breccia was so extremely hard and difficult to work as to render it
necessary to split it out with chisels, which frequently played sad havoc with
the bones it contained. These were sometimes so abundant as to form fully
50 per cent, of the entii-e accumulation. To use the language of one of
the workmen, " they lay about as if they had been thrown there with a

shovel."

   The progress of the work, as in most other cases, has rendered it necessary
to qualify somewhat the first impressions respecting the bones and teeth.

Instead of " exclusively the remains of bear," it may be said that " almost

exclusively " they are so ; for recently there have been found amongst them a
tooth of some cervine animal, a tooth of a Fox, and one or two bones of a bird.
Moreover, some of the bones are apparently too large to have formed part of

the skeleton even of Ursus spelceus. Nevertheless, it remains to be a fact
that in this deposit there have not been identified any relics of Bhinoceros,

Horse, Ox, Mammoth, Badger, Lion, or Hyaena, all of which were so frequently
exhumed from the Cave-earth ; nor are there any traces of fajces, or, with
one sohtaiy exception, of gnawed bones to indicate the presence of the last-
named animal.

   The bones found in the Cave-earth are divisible into two classes with
respect to their colour. The first includes specimens of an almost chalk-like
whiteness, and are very numerous ; the second those of a dark tinge, and are
very few. The dark hue of the second class is merely a surface discolora-
tion. Beneath a thin superficial film, the bones of this group are just as
white as those of the other. The colour of the specimens found in the Bock-
like Breccia differs from that of each of the foregoing series ; all of them are
characterized by the same somewhat light coffee-coloured tinge, which, more

or less, penetrates their entire substance.

   None of these older fossils appear to have been rolled, or to have been
fractured before they were lodged in the place in which they were found.
Fragments of jaws are numerous, and many of them contain teeth ; but,

with this exception, the relics lie together without the least reference to

their anatomical relations.

   In many respects their condition is precisely the same as that of the spe-

cimens in the Cave-earth. Thus, those found beneath large fallen blocks of
limestone are crushed, the severed parts remaining in position, and com-
monly held together by some firm cement. Again, other specimens are
covered with a film of stalagmitic matter. Further, the bones from the older
deposit adhere to the tongue just like those found in the Cave-earth, and
no distinction can be drawn between the two series on this quality alone.
These facts show, first, that the older formation, like the more modern
one, was compact, firm, unyielding, and capable of offering resistance to a
heavy falling block ; second, that, as has been already remarked in the case
of the Cave-earth, the bones had successively lain exposed on the surface for
a long period, and that the materials of the Breccia were introduced into the

Cavern at many different times, with protracted intermittences ; third, that

the fact that bones found in the same Cavern will adhere to the tongue with

equal tenacity is not, in itself, trustworthy evidence that they are of equal

antiquity.
--54 REPORT 1868.

   Up to this time, the Eock-like Breccia has been utterly sUent on the ques-
tion of the existence of Man ; it has given up no tools or chips of flint or

bone, no charred wood or bones, no bones split longitudinally, no stones sug-
gesting that they had been used as hammers or crushers. But whilst they
have before them the lessons so emphatically taught by their exploration
of the Cavern, the Committee cannot but think that it would be premature
to draw, at present, any inference from this negative fact.

    In the Western Division of the South-west Chamber, the very difficult

exploration of which is now in progress, the thickness of the Stalagmitic
Floor surpassed everything previously met with. Up to this time it has

averaged moi'e than 7 feet, in two instances only and over very limited spaces
it was so little as 3 feet, and it has reached so much as 12| feet.

    Cave-earth presented itself at the northern end of each section in the fii'st
seven foot-paraUels only, where it was rapidly thinning out, both southwards
and westwards. It was covered with its OAvn Modern Floor of Stalagmite,
and rested on the Older Floor of the same material, beneath which lay the
Eock-like Breccia. This, so far as is at present kno'ftTi, was the termination
of that great deposit of Cave-earth which, in unbroken continuity, has been

followed from the entrances of the Cavern, which has yielded so many

thousands of bones of extinct animals, and at least hundreds of Man's flint
and bone implements and their concomitant chips, and which in other still
larger branches of the Cavern awaits exploration. It will be shortly seen
that to the last it was true to its character.

   As in this Division the Modern Floor rested at once on the Older one and
assumed a crystalline structure, especially beyond the liae at which the Cave-
earth disappeared, it is sometimes not easy to say how much of the great
thickness just spoken of is to be ascribed to the period which separated the
era of the Rock-like Breccia from that of the comparatively modern Cave-
earth, and how much to the time which has elpased since the introduction

of the latter deposit terminated.

   In the upper part of this enormous accumulation some examples of charred
wood have been found ; and several stalactites, which no doubt had dropped
from the roof above, have been met with lodged in the mass. There are a
few peculiarities in the structure of this Stalagmite which have not been
noticed elsewhere. It sometimes has a honeycombed or cellular structure,
and in other places it is traversed in various directions by a series of tubular
cavities, both of which have greatly contributed to the difficulty which the
workmen have experienced in breaking it up ; for whilst the cavities do not
appear to diminish the strength of the mass, they allow the ignited gun-
powder room to expand, and thus render it almost impossible to excavate it

by blasting. When it is added that the Stalagmite is not traversed by great

divisional planes, as almost all rocks are, and that it nearly fills the Chamber

to the roof, it will be seen that at present, at least, the exploration requires
very pertinacious and skilful labour.

    It has been already stated that biit few flint implements were found in

the Lecture Hall, that these were much inferior to those brought to the

Association in previous years from other parts of the Cavern, and that the
Eastern Division of the South-west Chamber yielded a few chips only. It
was, pei'haps, not unreasonable to ascribe this paucity to the comparative
remoteness of the branches of the Cavern in which the researches have been
carried on during the year 1867-68. Be this as it may, the Superhitcndents
had but little hope or expectation that better fortune was awaiting them so
long as the work was day by day carrying them further on in the same
             ON Kent's cavern, devonshihe.              55

direction. Scarcely, however, had the exploration of the Western Division of

the South-west Chamher commenced, when the spell was broken.
   On June 25, 1868, a good implement was found 2 feet deep in the Cave

earth, in a small recess in the wall of the Chamber, and sealed up with the

Modern Floor of Stalagmite 80 inches thick. It was found broken, appa-

rently into four pieces, three of which have been recovered. Some of the

fractured edges are coated with Stalagmite. It lay with a fine almost un-

worn molar of bear, a molar of horse, and a few other teeth, one of which

probably was that of a fox.

   On July 4, a second implement was found. This also was 2 feet deep
in the Cave-earth, over which the Stalagmite was 32 inches thick. With it

there were a few bones, and immediately below it, thirteen molars of horse,

a canine of hyaena, and a gnawed bone. This specimen is of the Lanceolate

type, and is one of the finest implements the Committee have found in the

Cavern. It is barely 4-2 inches long, 1-2 in greatest breadth, and -5 inch

in greatest thickness. It is strongly carinated, sharply pointed at one end,

Achisel-shaped at the other, and has a keen edge all round its perimeter.

great amount of labour appears to have been expended in making it, but it
probably had never been used since it was last " retouched." It is of piebald

flint, being partly white, and partly a dull drab. It was dug out in the pre-

sence of one of the Superintendents.                    This was 3 feet deep

   On July 10, a thu-d implement presented itself.

in the Cave-earth, over which was 24 inches of Stalagmite. It is a fine

specimen, but scarcely equal to the second, which, excepting that it is not

quite so broad, and that its wider end is not chisel-shaped, it resembles in

size and in form. It is made of an almost uniformly white flint.
   On July 25, a fourth was met with in a recess in the wall of the Cavern,

1 foot deep in the Cave-earth, having over it upwards of 7 feet of Stalagmitic

Floor. It does not appear to have been so good a specimen as either of the

two last mentioned, but on this point there is some uncertainty, as it was

unfortunately broken by the workmen, who, notwithstanding a careful search,

were unable to recover all the fragments. Judged from the exterior only, it

would have been pronounced white flint ; but in consequence of the fracture

it is seen that this colour is merely superficial, extending to a depth of about

·05 inch only, the interior being uniformly black. It was lying with eleven

molars of horse, a sectorial tooth of hysena, several bones and bone fragments,

and a few small lumps of faecal matter. Judging from the character of its

point, this implement was a "borer."

Thus, within about a month, four flint implements, all of them good, and

two of them very fine specimens, were found within a space of 5 feet, and

from 140 to 150 feet from the nearest of the external entrances of the
Cavern. They were attended by the usual accompaniments, and with the

last of them the Cave-earth terminated in that direction, so far as is at pre-

sent known.

The Rock-like Breccia in this Division of the Chamber presented the ordi-

nary characteristics, and calls for no special remark.

In their Third Report (1867) the Committee called attention to the facts

which, successively and slowly discovered, had led to the conviction that
there was a Chapter in the history of the Cavern earlier than that represented

by the Cave-earth. It has been already stated, and at some length, that

further and most conclusive evidence on the point has presented itself dm-iug

the year 1867-68. The case is of so much interest, so characteristic of

Cavern researches, and so fuU of instruction and encouragement, that it
           --

--56 REPORT 1868.

may be worth while to give a brief recapitulation of the facts from the be-

ginning :

1st. The Committee had been at work upwards of five months when

cuboidal blocks of Stalagmite fii'st appeared in the Cave-earth and in the

overlying Stalagmitic Floor. After much deliberation, it was concluded that

they were fragments of an older Floor, which had covered a deposit of stiU

higher antiquity, and had been wholly or partially broken up before or during

the introduction of the Cave-earth in which the blocks were lodged. To this

conclusion, there was the great objection that there were no bones or stones

either within or attached to the blocks.

2nd. After the labour of six fui'ther months, during which every day dis-

interred additional blocks, but with the same negative characters, a large

portion of an old Floor was actually found in situ, but without having beneath

it any trace of a deposit which it had once sealed up. Though the probable
interpretation was that the deposit had been washed out, or had sunk away

from the floor through failure of support at its base, it seemed reasonable to

suppose that, in either case, stones or other remnants of it would be found

attached to the lower surface of the Floor. Instead of presenting such relics,

however, this lower surface was a beaiitiful cream-coloured plate of stalag-

mite, bristling with short stalactites of the same colour.
   3rd. In order to determine whether the so-called " remnant of old Floor "

was really stalagmitic throughout, several holes were bored through it, which

not only decided the question affirmatively, but caused a portion of its nether
surface to scale off, and to disclose the fact that the " cream-coloured plate "

was but    a   modern veneer  formed  on what  had  been  the  original  surface
                                                                                                         ;

--and this, when thus laid bare, proved to be soil-stained and crowded with

small particles of detrital matter relics of the missing mechanical deposit.

4th. After this, seventeen months passed, and though in the meantime

blocks of stalagmite were foimd everywhere, and some of them of great size,

and though the workmen purposely broke them into small pieces, stUl no

bone or stone was found within or projecting from them. At length, at the

end of the time just mentioned, one of them was broken and a bone M'as

found within it. After this, ossiferous blocks of stalagmite were dug out

frequently, and some of them were found to contain stones also.

5th. Within the compass of another month, loose round lumps of Rock-like

Breccia were met with in the Cave-earth, and, from their composition and

external form, were regarded as dislodged remnants of the older deposit which

had so long been seen by the mind's eye only. This opinion was strengthened

by the fact that the bones with which they were crowded did not appear to

represent precisely the same fauna as did those met with in the Cave-earth.
   6th. At the end of six additional months, the workmen came upon the

old deposit in situ, having all the characters of the lumps just mentioned, but

not separated from the Cave-earth above it by any Floor of Stalagmite.

7th. At the close of a fui'ther period of six weeks, or after three full years

of daily research, there was found, in one and the same vertical section, the

Old deposit of Breccia capped by its Stalagmite, on which lay the Cave-earth,

protected, in its turn, by its Stalagmitic Floor also. The early inference

from the blocks alone was justified ; not a link of the evidence was missing.
The entire chain was presented to the eye at one view. The case was at

length complete.

   The following fact may be appropriately mentioned in connexion with this

case. As has been ah'eady stated, a Subcommittee of the Tonjuay Natural-
History Society, in 1846, broke through the Modern Stalagmitic Floor in the
             --

                     ON Kent's cavern, Devonshire.                                                                                    57

South-west Chamber, and excavated the Cave-earth to the depth of 2 feet,

when, hav'ing found nothing, they abandoned the work. Had they continued

their labours but another half hour, had they dug but 2 inches lower, they
would have entered the richly ossiferous Breccia, and, in all probabihty,
caught sight of the earlier chapter of the history of the Cavern.

    It has been already mentioned that the Rock-like Breccia contains, amongst

other things, considerable pieces of stalagmite. There can be no doubt that
the same interpretation applies to these as applied to those found in the
Cave-earth. If the latter were correctly regarded as evidence of a floor older
than the deposit in which they were lodged, the former must be hold to

--indicate the existence of a floor still older than the Breccia a floor of the

third order of antiquity, which, in harmony with the terminology hitherto
used, may, for the present at least, be termed the '·' Oldest Floor of Stalag-

mite."

If the present state of the evidence be trustworthy, the Cavern, during

the era of the Rock-like Breccia, was almost exclusively a mausoleum for

Upf/y-SMs spelceus.  to this time, no trace of Hycemi spelcea, Felis spelcea,

Eleplias primix/mius, Ehinoceros tichorhinus, Eqims fossUis, or of several

other well-known cavern species has been found in the old deposit. Though

he was subsequently their contemporary in Devonshire, the Great Cave-Bear,

so far as the present evidence goes, seems to have had his home there very

long before them.

   The Committee have again to state that they have not yet had the good
fortune to discover any remains of Hippopotamus major or Machairodiis

Inlidens, either in the Cave-earth or in the Breccia.

    Whilst it must be admitted that the labours of the past twelve months
have not added anything to the kind, or very greatly to the amount, of evi-

dence of the antiquity of Man in Devonshire, it must also be admitted that

the continued and careful researches of three and a half years have utterly

failed to detect a single fact having even a remote tendency to invalidate the

conclusion to which the early Cavern researches had led. Up to this time,

the various kinds of evidence are in the most complete accord; there is

nothing conflicting. No comparatively modern object has been found below
its place, and no ancient one has been met with in a modern niche. The

Modern Floor of Stalagmite has kept the two apart and perfectly distinct.
There is nothing incongruous in the belief that the ancient Cave-Men made
and used impolished flint imi^lements, split the bones of animals, and cut and
scraped the fragments into pins and fish-spears, employed fire in the prepa-
ration of their food, and selected some stones for hammers or crushers, and
others to rub down the asperities on their bone tools ; and this belief ap-
parently embraces all the Cavern Anthropology which up to this time has
been discovered.

The researches of 1867-68, however, have been by no means barren or

unimportant. They have, as has been pointed out, established the existence

of two Chapters in the Cavern history during the times of the extinct mam-

mals, and have given a glimpse of a third and still earher one ; they have

solved  one problem, and, in  doing  so,  have  suggested  several others                                                             they
                                                                                                                                   ;

have given an increased stimulus to research by prompting the following

questions :

1st. "VNTiat were the conditions which at three diff'erent and widely sepa-

rated times allowed detrital matter to be carried into the Cavern ?

How2nd.          was the introduction of this material suspended during, at least,

two protracted periods, in which thick floors of Stalagmite were formed ?

   3rd. By what agency were these floors partially and largely broken up ?

and why, where they have been removed, have they left no scar on the walls
of the Cavern ?

   4th. Since, heretofore. Suspension has been followed by Excavation and
Ee-introduction, may this recur at some future time ?

   5th. Had the Great Cave-Bear any spelaean contemporaries at first ? and,
if so, What were they? and was Machairodus latidens or Hippopotamus major

amongst them ?
   6th. How, during the era of the Breccia, were the remains of the Cave-

Bear carried into the Cavern, seeing that none of them are rolled, broken, or
gnawed, yet they lie together without the least reference to their anatomical

relations ?

   It may be hoped that future researches may furnish solutions for at least

some of these questions.

            On Puddling Iron. By C. W. Siemens, F.R.S.*

Norwi'rnsTANDiNG the recent introduction of cast steel for structural pur-
poses, the production of wrought iron (and puddled steel) by the puddling

process ranks among the most important branches of British manufacture,
representing an annual production exceeding one and a half million of tons,
and a money value of about nine millions sterling.

   Although the puddling process must be admitted to be of great commercial
importance, and involves most interesting chemical problems, it has received
less scientific attention than other processes of more recent origin and infe-
rior importance, owing probably to the mistaken sentiment that a time-
honoured practice implies perfect adaj^tation of the best means to the end,
and leaves little scope for improvement.

   The scanty scientific literature on the subject will be found in Dr. Percy's
important work on iron and steel. Messrs. Crace-Calvert and Kichard
Johnson of Manchester! have supplied most valuable information by a series

of analyses of the contents of a puddling-furnace during the difierent stages

of the process. These prove that the molten pig metal is mixed intimately,
in the first place, either with a molten portion of the oxides, (or fettling,)
which form the lining or protecting covering to the cast-iron tray of the
puddling-chamber, or with a proportion of oxide of ii'on in the form of

 hammer-slag or red ore, thrown in expressly with the charge, that the

 silicon is first separated from the iron, that the carbon only leaves the iron
 during the " boil " or period of ebullition, and that the sulphur and phos-
phorus separate last of all while the metal is " coming to nature."

    The investigations by Price and Nicholson and by M. Lan confirm these
results, from which Dr. Percy draws some important general conclusions,
which have only to be followed up and supplemented by some additional

chemical facts and observations in order to render the puddling process per-

fectly intelligible, and to bring into relief the defective manner in which it is

at present put into practice, involving, as it does, great loss of metal, waste

of fuel and of human labour, and an imperfect separation of the two hurtful

--ingredients, sulphiir and phosphorus.
    Silicon. In forming (by means of the rabble) an intimate mechanical
mixture between the fluid cast metal and the cinder, the silicon contained in

the iron is brought into intimate contact with metallie oxide, and is rapidly

attacked, being found afterwards in the cinder in the form of silicic acid
(combined with oxide of iron). The heat of the furnace is always kept low
during this stage of the process, and the flame is maintained as reducing as

possible.

  --Carbon. The disappearance of the carbon from the metal is accompanied

by the appearance of violent ebullition and the evolution of carbonic oxide,
which rises in innumerable bubbles to the surface of the bath, and burns (in
an ordinary puddling-furnace) with the blue flame peculiar to that gas. In
puddling in a regenerative gas-furnace this blue flame cannot be observed,
because the flame of this furnace is strictly neutral, and there is no free
oxygen present to burn the carbonic oxide rising from the fluid mass a cii--
cumstance which by itself explains the superior results obtained from the

gas furnace.

It is popularly believed that the oxygen acting upon the silicon and carbon

of the metal is derived directly from the flame, which should, on that account,

be made to contain an excess of oxygen ; but the very appearance of the pro-

cess proves that the combination between carbon and oxygen does not take

place on the surface, but throughout the body of the fluid mass, and must be

attributed to the reaction of the carbon upon the fluid cinder in separating

from it metallic iron                                                              while as the removal of the silicon is stiU more rapid^
                                                                                ;

and is effected under a reducing flame, there is strong evidence that it also is

oxidized rather by the oxygen of the cinder than by the flame*.

But it has been arg-ued that, although the reaction takes place below the

surface, the oxygen may, nevertheless, be derived from the flame, which may

oxidize the iron on the surface, forming an oxide or cinder, which is then

transferred to the carbon at the bottom, in consequence of the general agita-

tion of the mass.

   This view I am, however, in a position to disprove by my recent expe-

rience in melting cast steel upon the open flame-bed of a furnace, having

invariably observed that no oxidation of the unprotected Jluid metal takes
place so long as it contains carbon in however slight a proportion.

   But being desirous to ascertain by positive proof what is the behaviour of
silicon and carbon in fluid cast iron when contact with the atmosphere or

the flame of the furnace is strictly prevented, I instituted the following ex-

periment at my Sample Steel Works at Birmingham :

    * At the end of this paper is appended a Table showing the comparative quantities of

   Ten cwt. of Acadian pig metal and 1 cwt. of broken glass were charged
upon the bed of a regenerative gas furnace (usually employed for melting
steel upon the open hearth).

   The bed of this furnace was formed of pure siliceous sand, and one object
in view was to ascertain whether any reaction takes place between silica and

fluid cast metal, it being generally supposed that metallic silicon is producetl
under such circumstances by the reducing action of the carbon in the metal
upon the silica or silicates present.

   The cast metal employed in this experiment was Acadian pig containing

               Silicon                  1-5 per cent.

               Carbon                  4-0 ,,

In the course of an hour the metal and glass were completely melted.     A
sample was taken out, containing

Silicon                 1'08 per cent.

At the end of the second hour another sample was taken out and tested, the

result being,

               Silicon              -96 per cent.
                                  2-40 ,, combined.
               Carbon

The physical condition of the metal had now undergone a decided change

the cai-bon having wholly combined with the iron, rendered it extremely

hard.

   The amount of silicon having steadily diminished, these results prove
that no silicon is taken up bij Jiuid east metal in contact with silica or siliccttes.

   The reduction of the amount of silicon in the metal might be accounted
for by the presence of minute quantities of oxides of iron, produced in melting

the pig metal, which oxides were now increased by the addition of haematite

ore in small quantities.

   At the end of the thu-d hour another sample was taken, containing

               Silicon            -76 per cent.

               Carbon             2-40 ,,        combined,

the metal being extremely hard as before. Additional doses of red ore were

added gradually without agitating the bath, and the effect upon the fluid

metal was observed from time to time.

At the end of the fifth hour the samples taken from the fluid bath assumed

a decidedly mild temper, when the addition of ore was stopped, and exactly

six hours after being charged the metal was tapped and run into ingots ; it

now contained

               Silicon                 '046 per cent.

               Carbon                  -2.50  ,,

Thus both the silicon and the carbon had been almost entii'ely removed from
the pig metal by mere contact with metallic oxide, under a protecting glass

covering.

   The quantity of red ore added to the bath amounted to 2 cwt., and the
weight of metal tapped to 10 cwt. 5 lbs., being slightly in excess of the
weight of pig metal charged.

   But the pig metal had contained

               Silicon                  1-5 per cent.
                                        4-0 ,,

                                                                         I

whereas the final metal contained only -296 of silicon and carbon, showing

a gain of metal of

                    5-5 - -296 =5-204 per cent.,

or, including the 5 lbs. of increased weight, a total gain of 5-7 per cent, of

metallic iron.

    Supported by these observations, I venture to assert that ilie removal of the
Silicon and Carbon from the piff iron in the ordinary puddling or " boiling"
process is due entirely to the action of the fluid oxide of iron present, and that
an equivalent amouiit of metallic iron is reduced and added to the bath, which
gain, however, is generally and unnecessarily lost again in the subsequent

stages of the process. The relative quantity of metal thus produced from the

fluid cinder admits of being accurately determined.

   The cinder may be taken to consist of Fe'' 0* (this being the fusible com-

bination of peroxide and protoxide), together with more or less tribasio sili-

cate (3 FeO, SiO''), which may be regarded as a neutral admixtiire, not

affecting the argument, and silicic acid or silica is represented by Si 0^, from

which it follows that for every four atoms of sUicon leaving the metal, nine

atoms of metallic iron are set free ; and taking the atomic weights of iron

= =28, and of silicon 22-5, it follows that for every

                                         4x22-o=90-0

grains of silicon abstracted from the metal,

                                      9x28 = 252

grains of metallic iron are liberated from the cinder.

Carbonic oxide, again, being represented by CO, and the cinder by Fe^ 0^,

it follows that for every four atoms of carbon removed from the metal three

atoms of iron are liberated ; and taking into account the atomic weights of

=6carbon  and of iron =28, it follows that for every

                            6x4=24

grains of carbon oxidized,

                            28x3=84

grains of metallic iron are added to the bath. Assuming ordinary forge pig,

after being remelted in the puddling-fui-nace, to contain about 3 per cent, of

carbon and 2 per cent, of silicon, it follows from the foregoing that in re-
moving this sUicon

          252
          -qjT X 2=5-6 per cent., and in removing the carbon

                            84

                            24X3=10-5

per cent, of metallic iron is added to the bath, making a total increase of

                               5.6 + 10-5-5=11-1

per cent., or a charge of 420 lbs. of forge pig metal ought to yield 466 lbs.
of wrought metal, whereas from an ordinary piiddling-furnace the actual
yield would generally amount to only 370 lbs. (or 12 per cent, less than the
charge), showing a difference of 96 lbs. between the theoretical and actual

yield in each charge.
    This difference, amounting to fully 20 per cent., is due to the enormous

waste by oxidation to which the iron is exposed after it has been " brought

to nature " (by the removal of the carbon), when it is in the form of a

granular or spongy metallic mass and during the process of forming it into
balls. So great a waste of metal by oxidation seems at first sight almost
incredible ; but considering the extent of surface exposed in the finely divided
puddled mass, it is not at all exceptional, and is in fact almost unavoidable
in a furnace of the ordinary construction, maintained as a puddling-fumace

is at a welding heat. Many attempts have been made (for example, by
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

Chenot, Clay, Renton, and others) to produce iron directly from the purer
ores, by reducing the ore in the first instance to a metallic sponge, and ball-
ing up this sponge, which is a loose porous mass somewhat similar to spongy
puddled iron, on the bed of a furnace ; but all these attempts have failed,
simply on account of the gi-eat waste of iron, a waste amounting to from 25 to
60 per cent, in balling up the sponge. Indeed the loss in an ordinary pud-
dling-fumace would probably be gi-eater than 20 per cent, if the metal were
not partly protected from the flame by the bath of cinder in which it lies
for in one instance in which the cinder accidentaUy ran out of a puddling-
furnace during the balling up of the charge, leaving the iron exposed to the

flame, I found the yield reduced from the average of 413 lbs. down to 370
lbs., showing an increased waste of 43 lbs., or over 10 per cent., due to the
more complete exposure of the metal to the oxidizing action of the flame.

    In order to realize the theoretical result, a suflicient amount of oxides must
have been supplied to effect the oxidation of the silicon and carbon of the
pig iron, and to form a tribasic silicate of iron (3FeO, SiO^) with the silicic

acid produced.

   The amount of oxide required may be readily ascertained.

    In taking the expression Fe^ 0*, the atomic weight of which is

                              3x28 + 4x8=116,

while that of the three atoms of iron alone is

                                       3x28=84,

it foUows that
                                           116 ,

                                        gj X 46=63-5 lbs.

of cinder or oxide of iron are requisite to produce the 46 lbs. of reduced iron
which were added to the bath. There must, however, remain a sufficient
quantity of fluid cinder in the bath to form with the silicon (extracted from
the iron) a tribasic silicate of iron, or about 60 lbs., making in all 124 lbs. of
fettling, which would have to be added for each charge, a quantity which is
generally exceeded in practice, not^vithstanding the inferior results univer-

sally obtained.

    There remain for our consideration the sulphur and phosphorus, which being
generally contained in Enghsh forge pig in the proportion of from -2 to '6
per cent, each, can hardly affect the foregoing quantitative results, although
they are of great importance as affecting the quality of the metal produced.

    It has been suggested by Percy that the separation of these ingredients

may be due to Jiqualion. This I understand to mean that the crystals of
metallic iron which form throughout the boiling mass when the metal " comes
to nature," exclude foreign substances in the same way that the ice formed
upon sea-water excludes the salt, and yields sweet water when remelted.

   According to this view, pig metal of inferior quality wUl really yield iron
almost chemically pure, to which foreign ingredients are again added by me-
chanical admixture with the surrounding cinder, or semireduced metal.

   It may be safely inferred that the freedom of the metal from impurities
thus taken up will mainly depend upon the temperature, which should be

high, in order to ensure the perfect fluidity and complete separation of the

cinder.

    Led by these chemical considerations, and by practical attention to the

subject, extending over several years, I am brought to the conclusion that the

process of puddling, as practised at piresent, is extremely ivastefid in iron and
fuel, immensely laborious, and yielding a metal only imperfectly separated from-

its impurities.

   How nearly we shall be able to approach the results indicated by the che-

mical reasoning here adopted, I am not prepared to say ; but that much can

be accomplished by the means actually at our doors is proved by the result

of the working of a puddling-furnace erected eighteen months since to my

designs by the Bolton Steel and Iron Company in Lancashire.

    This furnace consists of a puddling-chamber of very nearly the ordinary
form, which is heated, however, by means of a regenerative gas furnace, a

system of which the principle is now sufficiently well established to render a

very detailed description here unnecessary. The general arrangement of the
furnace is shown in the accompanying illustrations. It consists of two

essential parts :

   The Gas-producer, in which the coal or other fuel is converted into a com-
bustible gas ; and

   The Furnace, with its " regenerators " or chambers for storing the waste
heat of the flame, and giving it up to the incoming air or gas.

            --Fig. 1. Section of Gas-producer. Scale -j^ inch to a foot.

   The Gas-producer is shown in fig. 1 ; it is a rectangular firebrick chamber,
one side of which, b, is inclined at an angle of from 45° to 60°, and is pro-

vided with a grate, c, at its foot. The fuel, which may be of any descrip-

tion, such as coal, coke, lignite, peat, or even sawdust, is filled in through a
hopper. A, at the top of the incline, and falls in a thick bed upon the grate.

    Air is admitted at the grate, and, in burning, its oxygen unites with the
carbon of the fuel, forming carbonic-acid gas, which rises slowly through
--64 REPORT 1868.

tlie ignited mass, taking up an additional equivalent of carbon, and thus
forming carbonic oxide. The heat thus produced distils off carburetted
hydrogen and other gases and vapours from the fuel as it descends gradually
towards the grate, and the carbonic oxide already named, diluted by the
inert nitrogen of the air, and by any small quantity of unreduced carbonic
acid, and mixed with these gases and vapours distilled from the raw fuel, is
finally led off by the gas-flue to the furnace. The ashes and clinkers that
accumulate in the grate are removed at intervals of one or two days.

    E is a pipe for the purpose of supplying a little water to the ash-pit, to be
decomposed as it evaporates and comes in contact with the incandescent fuel,
thus forming some hydrogen and carbonic oxide, which serve to enrich the

gas ; G is a small plughole by which the state of the fire may be inspected,

and the fuel moved by a bar if necessary ; and d is a sliding damper by which
the gas-producer may be shut off at any time from the flue.

    It is necessary to maintain a slight outward pressure through the whole
 length of the gas-flue leading to the furnaces, in order to prevent the burn-
ing of the gas in the flue through the indraught of air at crevices in the

brickwork.

    Where the furnaces stand much higher than the gas-producers, the re-
 quired pressure is at once obtained ; but more frequently the furnaces and
 gas-producers are placed nearly on the same level, and some special arrange-
 ment is necessary to maintain th^ pressure in the flue. The most simple
 contrivance for this purpose is the " elevated cooling-tube." The hot gas
 is carried up by a brick stack, n, to a height of eight or ton feet above the top

 of the gas- producer, and is led through a horizontal sheet-iron cooling-tube,

 J (fig. 1), from which it passes down either directly to the furnace, or into
 an underground brick flue.

    The gas rising from the producer at a temperature of about 1000° Fahr.,
 is cooled as it passes along the overhead tube, and the descending column is
 consequently denser and heavier than the ascending column of the same
 length, and continually overbalances it. The system forms, in fact, a siphon
 in which the two limbs are of equal length, but the one is flUed with a heavier

 gaseous fluid than the other.

     In erecting a number of gas-producers and furnaces, I generally prefer to
 group the producers together, leading the gas from all into one nuiin flue,
 from which the several furnaces draw their supplies.

     The Puddling-Furnace proper is shown in figures 2, 3, and 4.
     Fig. 2 is a front elevation of the furnace, showing the gas-reversing valve

 and flues in section.
     Fig. 3 is a longitudinal section at a, b, c, d (fig. 4).

    Fig. 4 is a sectional plan at l, m (fig. 3).
     The peculiarity of the regenerative gas furnace, as applied cither to

 puddling or to any other process in which a high heat is reqiured, consists
 in the utilization in the furnace of nearly the whole of the heat of combus-
 tion of the fuel, by heating the entering gas and air by means of the waste
  heat of the products of combustion after they have left the furnace, and are
 of no further use for the operation being carried on. The Avaste heat is, so
  to speak, intercepted on its passage to the chimney by means of masses of
  firebrick stacked in an open or loose manner in certain chambers, called

  "regenerator chambers," c, e, e . c^ (fig. 3).

     On first lighting the furnace the gas passes in through the gas-regulating

  valve, B (fig. 2), and the gas-reversing valve, b', and is led into the flue, m,
  and thence into the bottom of the regenerator chamber, c (fig. 3) ; while the

    The currents of gas and air, both quite cold, rise separately through the
regenerator chambers, c and e (fig. 3), and pass up through the flues, o, g, and
F, F, F (fig. 4) respectively, into the furnace above, where they meet and are
lighted, burning and producing a moderate heat. The products of combus-

tion pass away through a similar set of flues at the other end of the furnace
into the regenerator chambers c , e^ (fig. 3), and thence through the flues
m', n' (fig. 2), and through the gas- and air-reversing valves into the chimney-
flue, 0. The waste heat is thus deposited in the ujiper courses of open fii'e-
brick work filling the chambers, c,, e, (fig. 3), so heating them up, while the
lower portion and the chimney-flue are still quite cool ; then, after about an
hour, the reversing-valves, b' (fig. 2) (through which the air and gas are
admitted to the furnace) are reversed, by means of the levers, p, and the air
and gas enter through those regenerator chambers, e^, c, (fig. 3), that have
just been heated by the waste products of combustion, and in passing up
through the open brickwork they become heated, and tJien, on meeting and
entering into combustion in the furnace, n, d, they produce a very high tem-
perature, probably 500° Fahr. higher than when admitted cold ; the waste
heat from such higher temperature of combustion heating up the previously

cold regenerator chambers, c, e, to a correspondingly higher heat.
    After about an hour's work, the reversing-valves, b' (fig. 2), are again

reversed, and the air and gas enter the first pair of regenerator chambers,

c, E (fig. 3), but which are now very hot, and therefore the air and gas

become very hot, and enter the fm*nace in this state, meeting and entering
into combustion, and thus producing a stiU higher temperature, probably
500° higher still, and again heating the second pair of regenerator chambers,

c,, E^, so much higher, which enables them to again heat the air and gas to a
stiU higher degree, when the valves, b' (fig. 2), are again reversed. Thus an
accumulation of heat and an accession of temperature is obtained, step by step,

so to speak, until the furnace is as hot as is required ; for unless cold mate-
rials are put in to be heated, and thus abstract heat, the temperature rises as
long as the furnace holds together, and the supply of gas and air is con-
tinued. The heat is at the same time so thoroughly abstracted from the pro-
ducts of combustion by the regenerators, that the chimney-flue remains

always quite cool. The command of the temperature of the furnace and of
the quality of the flame is rendered complete by means of the gas and air re-
gulating valves shown at b, in fig. 2, and by the chimney-damper. These

are adjusted to any required extent of opening by the notched rods, q, e, and
s (fig. 2), respectively, so that, having the power of producing as high a tem-
perature as can be desired, there is also the power of varying it according to
the requirements in each case.

   The bed of the furnace, d d (fig. 3), is of the ordinary construction, formed
of iron plates, and is provided with water-bridges at the ends, as shown, to
       ON PUDDLING IRON.          67

protect the "fettling" (or oxide of iron used for lining the furnace) from
being melted away. The overflow from one of the water-bridges is led into
a sheet-iron tank below the bed, and then away. The evaporation from tliis
tank keeps the bottom plates cool and preserves the cinder covering them
from melting off, and the steam is carried away by a draught of air entering
through two holes, i, i (fig. 2), below the tap-hole, and passing off by small
ventilating shafts, k, k (fig. 4), at the back of the furnace.

  A heating chamber, h (fig. 3), is arranged at each end of the furnace, in

which the charge of pig iron may be heated to redness before it is introduced

into the puddling-chamber, d d.

   The advantages of this furnace for puddling are, that the heat can be
raised to an almost unlimited degree, that the flame can be made at will

oxidizing, neutral, or reducing, without interfering with the temperature,
that indraughts of air and cutting flames are avoided, and that the gas-
fuel is free from ashes, dust, and other impurities which are carried into an

ordinary puddling-furnace from the grate. In this last respect, the new

furnace presents the same advantages as puddling ^vith wood.
   The following Tables give the working results which were obtained from

this furnace, as compared with the results obtained at the same time in an
ordinary furnace from the same pig (the ordinary forge mixture).

or 22 cwt. 2 qrs. 20 lbs. of pig iron per ton of puddled bar.

   It will be observed that the ordinary furnace received charges of 484 lbs.
each, and pelded on an average 426 lbs., representing a loss of 12 per cent.,
whereas the gas furnace received charges averaging 424 lbs., and yielded
413 lbs., representing a loss of less than 2-6 per cent.

    It is important to observe, moreover, that the gas furnace turned out eighteen
heats in three shifts per twenty-four hours, instead of only twelve heats

per twenty-four hours, which was the limit of production in the ordinary

furnace.

   This rate of working was attained without the employment of any
arrangement for heating the pig iron before charging it into the furnace,
the heating-chambers at the ends not having been used. The adoption of
the plan of heating the metal beforehand (a system already extensively in
use both in this country and on the Continent) effects a further saving of ten

to fifteen minutes in the time required for working each charge, as weU as a

considerable economy in fuel.
   The quality of the iron produced from the gas furnace was proved de-

cidedly superior to that from the ordinary furnace, being what is technically
called " best best" in the one, and " best " in the other case, from the same

pig iron of average quality.

    The following was the result of an analysis of an inferior English pig iron
before and after being puddled in the gas furnace :

showing the extent to which foreign matters are actually removed by the

process of puddling.

   These analyses were made a few days ago by Mr. A. "WiUis in my labora-

tory at Birmingham.

The economy of fuel was also greatly in favour of the gas furnace, but

could not be accurately ascertained, because some mill-furnaces were worked

from the same set of producers. StiU, judging from the experience of

several years in the working of regenerative gas furnaces as reheating or

mill-furnaces and as glass-furnaces, the saving of fuel in puddling cannot be

less than 40 to 50 per cent, in quantity, while a much cheaper quality may

be used.

The consumption of "fettling" was, however, greater in the gas furnace,

and the superior yield was naturally attributed by the forge managers to

that cause, although the writer held a different opinion.

The  gas furnace,    however,   had     not  been  provided  with  water-bridges

these were subsequently added, and the furnace put to work again in

February last, since which time it has been worked continuously.
   The result of the water-bridges has been that the amount of " fettling "

required is reduced to an ordinary proportion, the average quantity of red

ore used being 92-6 lbs. per charge, besides the usual allowance of bulldog,

Fourth Report on the Structure and Classification of the Fossil

   Crustacea. By Henry Woodward^ F.G.S., F.Z.S., of the British

   Museum.

                                                   (Plate II.)

During the past year no new Silurian forms of Crustacea have come under

my notice, save the series which I had the pleasure to exhibit at Dundee.

Of these, belonging to the Order Merostomata, the following have been
fully described and figured :

                                              a. EnETPTEBID^*.

                         1 Eurypterus (Fterygotus) punctatus, Salter, sp.
                           2. scorpioides, sp. uov.
                          3. obesus, sp. nov.
                          4. Pterygotus raniceps, sp. nov.

    b. LlMULIDiEt.

Neolimulus falcatus, sp. et gen. nov.

Perhaps the most interesting point which I have been able to determine

in connexion with these Upper-SUurian forms is the occurrence of gill-plates

in P/eri/gotus in precisely the same relative position as we find they occupy

in Lhmdus at the present day, but differing in form. These leaf-like

branchiae occur in rows, and still exhibit their highly vascular structure, and

indicate by their aspect in the fossil state their extreme tenuity.

   It is very interesting to me, and I cannot but oelieve that it will also in-
terest others working at the Invcrtehrata, to find the number of points which

Fteri/r/otus possesses in common with the Scorpionidce among the Arachnida.

   If the organs called " combs," which are attached to the first thoracic seg-

ment of Scorpio, be rudimentary gills, not wholly aborted, we have another

point of analogy gained between the two J.

That rudimentary gills existed in Pterygotus at the border of the segments,

and in that position in which the pulmonary sacs in Scoi^^io are found, I

have evidence both from the Devonian and Silurian species.

The position also of the ovaries in Pteryyotus and /Scorp/o is the same,

though in the former the opening to the sacs is double, as in Limidus and

Aother Crustacea, whereas in Scorpio it is externally central as in Insects.

Mybilobed plate conceals the apertui-es in both forms.  conclusion is that

there is good ground for assuming that Pterygotus represented, in Palaeozoic

time, the aquatic condition of Scorpio, just as the aquatic larvae of Libellula

represent to day the imago of a futai'e season.

I have lately received specimens from the Carboniferous shales of Carluke

of a new form of Crustacean allied to Cyclus. I was at first doubtful whe-

ther the Cyclus radialis of M. de Koninck, from Belgium, reaUy represented

the Agnostus radicdis of Prof. Phillips, from the Carboniferous Limestone of

BoUand, Yorkshii'e. I have fortunately been able to see and examine the

original specimen of Cyclus radialis of De Koninck, and find that it does agree

with the figure in Phillips's ' Geology of Yorkshire ' (vol. ii. t. 22. fig. 25) ;
but it entirely disagrees with M. de Koninck's magnified figure. I have

therefore redi-awn the Belgian form, and propose to figure it by the side

&of the new British form from Carluke. (See Plate II. figs. 1 2.)

ON THE STRUCTURE AND CLASSIFICATION OF THE FOSSIL CRUSTACEA. 7^J

    Cifclus radialis (PI. II. fig. 1) is an elegant little shield-shaped buckler
5 lines long by 4 in breadth ; its general form is hemispherical, with a

narrow smooth border; the shield is divided down its centre by a raised

longitudinal ridge, from which radiate seven diverging ribs whose rounded

ends reach the lateral and posterior border.

The anterior cephalic portion occupies about a quarter of the entire shield,

and is ornamented by the spreading oiit of the raised central ridge, and by

two subcentral rounded prominences which correspond in position to eye-

spots, but are not facetted. The ribs are ornamented each with from three

to five tubercles irregidarly disposed over their surface.

The new form of Cyclus (PI. II. fig. 2) discovered by Dr. Eankine of

Carluke, in the Carboniferous shales of that place, is most remarkable in

appearance, and certainly far more like a parasitical Crustacean than the

Cyclus radialis, which certainly seems to have been furnished vsdth a hard

calcareous test. A comparison of the two, however, leaves no doubt in my

mind in referring them both to one genus.

The shield is about 4 lines in diameter, and conveys the idea of an ex-

tremely thin test flattened out on the soft shale by pressure. The eye-spots

occupy the  same  relative  position  as  in  0.  radialis                                    but the divisions which
                                                                                           ;

represent the costae are six, not seven in nimiber in this species, and these

anastomose together on the lateral border, and diverge, not from a median

raised ridge, but a broad V-shaped central area. One is reminded by this

Crustacean of the appearance of Argulus, Bojyyriis, and other recent parasitic

forms, and also of the disk-shaped Discinoearis, from which it diSers, how-

ever, in the prominent eyes and costated shield.

Por this new species (Plate II. fig. 2) I propose the name of Cyclus Ban-

Jrini, after its discoverer.

 --In describing Cyclus radialis, M. de Koninck observes :

    " There is no doubt this animal should be ranged with the Crustacea,

and in Milne-Edwards's order Trilobita abnormalia and battoidea, near to

Aynostus."

   M. de Koninck also thinks it probable that the body of Cyclus was soft and

very contractile, that it was a parasite, and that the two tubercles which

--we have called the eyes really covered those organs and, further, that the

ribbed border protected the feet when the animal was in repose.

  We must differ from M. de Koninck in referring this form to the Trilobita.

If truly an adult, it must be placed near to Apus with the other shield-

bearing PhyUopoda ; if a larval form, it may have been the early stage of
Prestwichia or some other of the Coal-measures Liimdidce. Nor do we think

it in the least probable that the shield of Cyclus radialis was flexible or con-

tractile, its original segments being completely soldered together into one

piece.

   Hermann von Meyer has figured a small Crustacean head-shield under the
name of Halicyne agnota, and a second species, H. la.va*, from the Mus-

chelkalk of Eottweil in Germany. Goldfuss originally figured it as an
Olenus (0. serotinus) ; afterwards it was referred to Linndus by Miinster

(Beitrage, 1841, Bd. i. t. v. f. 1). To both these conclusions Meyer demurs--

to Linndus because no eyes are visible, and to the Trilobita because none are
found older than the Carboniferous.

The     form of  this head-shield is extremely like  that of Arjnostus                                                                       but the
                                                                                                                                          ;

Aynostidoi are confined to the Lower Silurian strata, between which and the

--74 REPOKT 1868.

Trias are the long intervening series of Upper SUurian, Devonian, Carboni-

ferous, and Permian formations. I consider this form may more properly
be placed with Bunodes, Hemiaspis, &c. among the aberrant forms of the
Limulidce, of which it may possibly have been a larval state.

   Among the Secondary forms of Crustacea I have described the following

from British specimens during the past year.

   Palinurina longipes. Lower Lias, Lyme. (Geol. Mag. 1868, vol. v.

p. 260, pi. 14. fig. .5.)

   Pseudoghjpheagrandis. Lower Lias, Weston. (Ibid. p. 353, pi. 17. fig. 1 .)
    Ghjphea rostmta. Lower Lias, Weston. (Ibid. p. 354, pi. 17. fig. 2.)

          Heeri. Lower Lias, Lyme Regis. (Ibid. p. 355, pi. 17. fig. 3.)
            Tomesii. Lower Lias, Welford HiU, Stratford-on-Avon. (Ibid.

p. 356, pi. 17. fig. 4.)

I have now to notice another species, of the genus Penaus of rabricius,

from the Lower Lias, Northampton. This is a remarkably persistent form

and the genus is actually found now living in the Mediterranean, if Dr.

Oppel's determination be correct, which I feel little doubt in endorsing.

   This handsome Crustacean (see Plate II. fig. 3) was not less than 9^
inches in length when measured along the dorsal line, the carapace being
about 3 inches, and the abdomen 6| ; the rostrum was very strongly serrated
as in the Pcdcemonidce, but the serrations have been abraded in the fossil.

This form most nearly resembles in size and appearance the Penwus speciosus

of Miinster, but diff'ers slightly in the form of the border of the abdominal

segments, and also in the direction of the strong and deeply forked sulcus

which marks each side of the latero-anterior portion of the carapace near

the base of the great antennae. The surface of the carapace and segments
was highly enamelled, some portions of which may stiU be observed in the
fossil. I have named it Pence-iis Sharpii, after Mr. Samuel Sharp, F.G.S., who

is the discoverer of the fossil.

   Of the Cretaceous Crustacea two have been noticed by me, viz. a new

Cirripede from the Norwich Chalk, Pyrgoma cretacea (Geol. Mag. vol. v. 1868,

p. 258, pi. 14. figs. 1 & 2), and Necrocarcinus tricarinatus, from the Gault

of Folkestone (ibid. p. 259, pi. 14. fig. 4).

   I am now enabled to add two new species of a family not hitherto before

noticed in a fossil state in Britain, the fanuly of the TJialassinidce.

   This curious group contains several genera and species. Those of which

we know the habits, burrow in the sand, which they readily excavate with

their feet.

   Although frequently foimd fossU, especially in the Upper Chalk of Maes-

tricht, of Prance, and Bohemia, we rarely see atracc of their bodies. Even

in dredging, the usual thing is to find the two fore claws only in the dredge
(if any part of them is taken at aU). In the fossil state it is to be also

anticipated that their occurrence would be rare, as the integument of their

bodies (like that of the Hermit-Crab and others which conceal themselves

in foreign substances) is extremely thin, and often soft. I may compare

the difference of their test to that which exists between a lady's hand encased

from infancy in a kid glove, and the hand of a savage who uses his digits

constantly for delving in the ground after roots. In the one, the covei-ing
membrane is thin and soft ; in the other, hard and horny. One might even
go further and imagine (liy repeated exclusion from use) the nails would

be no longer developed                                                                                             certainly they are less powerful as ofiensive weapons.
                                                                                                                ;

This is precisely what we find docs take place in the burrowing Crustacea
             ON THE BRITISH FOSSIL CORALS.                  75

the hard and shelly epimeral pieces of the hody-segments are not properly

developed (as they are in the common lobster and other active swimming

long-tailed forms), and the lobes of the tail are in like manner mdimentary.

Such changes I cannot but conceive to have been the result of long habit,

arising from the disuse of the organs of a part of the body, causing first their

gradual reduction in size, and finally resulting in their abortion. The
two new species of TlmlassinidcB I have to notice belong to the genus

Callianassa, hitherto characteristic of the Maestricht Chalk, and found also

Weliving in our ovni seas.  are now able to take it back to the Lower

Greensand on the one hand, and link together the Cretaceous and Recent

periods by a species in the Eocene beds of Hempstead, Isle of Wight. I have
named the first Callianassa Neocomiensis, from the Greensand, Colru Glen,

Belfast (PI. II. fig. 5), and the second Callianassa Batei (after Mr. C. Spence

Bate), fi-om Hempstead Upper Marine series. Isle of Wight. (Plate IT. fig. 4.)

This is a genus which should be looked out for by collectors of Upper-

Chalk fossils in Norwich.

   The Plates exhibited are intended for the second part of my Monograph on

the fossil Merostomata, which now awaits its turn of publication. I wish to

add a word here in favour of the Palseontographical Society, as deserving of
support, as a means of enabling authors writing upon special branches of
Palaeontology to secure the publication of their researches. If more sub-
scribers would only come forward in its aid, more authors would be enabled
to make their work known, and much time would be saved. The last volume
issued is an illustration of what they give for their annual guinea subscrip-

tion*.

By P. Martin Duncan, M.B. Lond., F.R.S., F.G.S., Sec. Geol. Soc.

This Eeport consists of notes of observations made upon the Coral-faunae

described by MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime in the monograph of the

·British Fossil Corals' (Palseontographical Society, 18.50), of descriptions of

new and unpublished species, of notices of species published by me in 1867

and 1868, and of examinations into the affinities of the forms and their

geological positions.

   * The last volume issued contained 45 Plates (9 of which were double quarto) and 238

4to pages of text.

                                                                           g2
76 REPOKT 1868.

   The fossil Corals of the Crag, Brockenhurst beds, Eocene deposits. Upper
and Lower "Wliite Chalk strata, Upper Greensand and Red Chalk rock of Hun-
stanton are considered, and also those of the Rhaetic beds and of the great

Liassic series.

   The fossil Corals of the Lias have been described by me and published in

two parts by the Palaeontographical Society during the last twelve months.

This great fauna, with- the exception of one species, is new to Great Britain,

and has been illustrated in seventeen plates.

   The fossil Corals of the Red Chalk of Hunstanton have just been litho-

graphed in one plate ; and those from the interesting Tertiary deposit at
Brockenhurst have been already published and illustrated (1866).

   The Report dwells fully upon these three new faunae. The species de-

scribed by MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime, from the strata whose

Corals are noticed here, are forty-three in number.

. I am glad to add notices of 115 species new to Great Britain, twenty-five

of the species having been described in the Coral-faunae of the Continent.

   The labour of passing so many forms under review, and of superintending

twenty- six plates published by the Palaeontographical Society, two plates in
the Philosophical Transactions, and one in the Journal of the Geological

Society, may perhaps be explanatory of the impossibility of my concluding

the Report on the Cretaceous Coral-fauna.

   The new species from the Gault, however, have been lithographed but not
published ; but those from the Upper Greensand and Neocomian have not yet

been drawn.
    There remains for a future Report the description of the fossil Corals of

    The vast Coral-remains of the Palasozoic age have not been alluded to in

this Report ; and although I have had the advantage of Mr. Thomson's
valuable skill in producing sections of Carboniferous corals, and also of inves-
tigating large series of Devonian and Siliuian forms, I can only assert that,
before any satisfactory communication on these early Zoantharia can be

written, much time must be occupied and much labour be undergone *.

                                  ON THE BRITISH FOSSIL CORALS.

                                                        REPORT.

The researches of Darwin, Dana, and others have been so long before the

scientific world, that the external physical conditions accomjianying Coral

life are universally well understood. The physico-chemical changes which

take place in dead corals and influence their future fossil condition have been

described ; and it is most reasonable to assert that the representatives of the

existing Coral-faunae flourished under the same kind of conditions, and were

subjected to the same prefossil incidents and changes.

Corals are either aggregated in reefs or distribvited sparely over the sea-

bottom. In the strata of nearly every formation, somewhere or other,

aggregations of corals are found, either in great banks, or as distinct reefs

hanging on to the older rocks ; moreover sparely distributed solitary or
simple forms are universal.

In the Caribbean Sea, the Indo-Pacific, the Great Ocean, the China seas,

aggregations occur and the species flom-ish in comparatively shallow water.

Ill the deep water from 50 to 200 fathoms, between reefs, simple and sparely

distributed species occur ; and in other seas, where there are no reefs, the sea-

bottom from about 50 to 200 fathoms supports larger or smaller simple and a
few compound forms.

The Mediterranean, the Atlantic off the Spanish coast, the Bay of Biscay,

the South-west British sea, and especially the seas between Unst and
Norway are characterized by numerous simple Madreporaria and a few com-

pound forms.

This geographical and bathymetrical distribution must influence us in

reasoning geologically upon the presence of corals in strata ; and a tropical
climate must not be of necessity inferred from the discovery even of fine

specimens.

Corals cannot migrate except by the floating away of their ova ; and very

slight alterations in the very definite physical conditions destroy the parent

stock as well as the ova. It is not surprising therefore to find the species very

much restricted in their vertical range in strata. Recent species vary greatly

under slight modifications of the sea-depth, force of wave, and purity of sea-

water                             and it is found that  corresponding  variations  occurred in every age,
                               ;

the minute structural differences repeated over and over again in specimens

from the same deposits having clearly a genetic relation to a definite type.

As there are now geographical provinces of corals differing in genera, species,
and in physical peculiarity, so in every formation down to the Lower Silu-

rian there are evidences of areas characterized by reefs or by simple and

solitary species, and the species of distant localities were, as now, different,

peculiar, and occasionally identical. From those early days there have been

opportunities for the migration of distant species by their ova ; and it is
found that the fossil species peculiar to a certain geological horizon in one

part of the world are often represented by closely allied species, varieties, or

identical forms in higher or lower horizons in other parts. Some few

forms are very persistent ; and those which have lasted through the Tertiary

ages into the present have a great geographical range, just as those which

had a great vertical range in older deposits had also a great horizontal area.

   It is necessary, in considering the relative ages and contemporaneity of
coral species, to remember that a coral reef on the side of a precipitous sub-

merged mountain-top had its debris carried down the abyss for ages, and

that this is enormous in amount.

It must be remembered that in the course of time the distance between
78 REPORT-- 1868.

the bottom of the reef and the top of the detritus vnll decrease very
sensibly, and that any gradual elevation of the reef above the sea, pro-
ducing its destruction, would be accompanied by a more rapid descent
of debris. In after ages the upper and stony deposit would perchance be
considered of different age from the marly and fine sediment below. Again,
deep seas creeping over littoral areas and then over the land during the
gradual subsidence of great areas would bring simple corals over littoral

and terrestrial remains, the species all being really contemporaneous. On

the other hand, a long-continued subsidence would equally tend to the increase
of the reef and of the deep-water sediment. After the loweiing of the area
had been destructive to the reef, and no more detritus could fall, the usual
ooze of the deep sea would gradually invade aU. These suggestions wUl
perhaps render the occurrence of large coraUiferous deposits in certain strata
only, in large areas of formations, more comprehensible, and wiU tend to the

belief that when coraUiferous deposits occur at the base of a great series of

uncoralliferous strata (and this is often the case) the idea of contemporaneity
is not overcome by the evident succession of the deposits.

    The relation between such faunae as the St.-Cassian and South "Wales
Lower Lias of the zone of Ammonites angulatus is evident; but the inter-
mediate faunae of Azzarola and of the lowest zones of the Lias on the Con-
tinent are less closely allied to the Welsh fauna. Again, the fauna of the
Welsh Lower Lias is more closely allied to the Lower Oolitic Coral-fauna of
England than are the Coral-faunae of the zones of A. BucMandi, A. raricos-
tatus, and of the Middle and Upper Lias.

   How interesting is the affinity between the Coral-fauna of Gosau and the

Miocene Coral-fauna of the Caribbean area ! yet the British Chalk hardly
represents any part of the Gosau fauna, and our Eocene fauna has no

resemblance to it. These considerations tend to prove how vast and com-
plicated the gradual migrations must have been, even of animals which
could only live under veiy definite and limited conditions, how really con-

temporaneous were the species entombed in vast consecutive deposits,

how complicated the relations of the fauna have ever been, and how clearly

the absence of corals from strata does not prove their absence in adjoining

and equivalent areas. The notion that successive new creations of corals

followed repeated destructions of faunae is not supported by a single fact ; on
the contrary, all the evidence disproves it. The amount of individual varia-
tion, of gradual structural changes, and of decided variation amongst the
Madreporaria is not without significance ; and the examination of large series
of forms from all parts of the world, and from consecutive formations, im-

presses the belief in the continuous evolution of new forms by variation from

the old during the whole of the Coral ages.

the Crag. As a general nile, tlie most preservable and commonest of the

true corals are not found in recent seas with Bryozoa ; but certain forms
inhabiting the sea-bottom from the lowest spring-tide level to 200 or more
fathoms are brought up by the dredge with Bryozoa. These forms are
strongly represented in the Crag Coral -fauna.

                          List of Crag Species.

       Flabellum Woodii, Ed. # H.

   Splienotrochus intermedins is found in the Coralline Crag and in the Eed
Crag of England, and it has been found in the Antwerp Crag. The genus

still exists, and is represented in the south-western and western British and

Irish seas.

Sphenotrochus M'Andretvamis, Ed. & H., the Turhinolia Milletiana of

William Thompson, from Cornwall and Arran, is closely allied to the Cra*

species ; and it is very evident, from the variability of these simple corals, that

Sphenotrochus Milleticinus (Defrance, sp.) of the Anjou andTouraine Miocene,

Sphmiotrochus intermedius, and Sphenotrochus M'Andrewanus have descended

from one type, and that they have been slightly modified to meet the changes

in the external conditions in the later Tertiary and recent seas. Probably

these Crag and recent species should be considered varieties of the Miocene

Myform.      researches in the Australian Tertiary Coral-fauna have brought

two species of Sphenotrochus to hght ; but they are only remotely allied to

the British species.

The aUiance between Fhthellum Woodii and F. Eoissyanum of Dax and

Malaga, and F. cristatum  of the Bolderberg,   is  not  close                        and  the affinity

between the British Crag species and the living F. anthophjillum, Ehrenberg,

of the Mediterranean and Spanish coast, and perhaps from our north-east

seas, is slight. FlaheUum Woodii is closely allied to F. subturhinatum, Ed.

and H., of the iliocene of Plaisance, and F. OalJapagense, from the GaUapagos

Miocene. F. Woodii is found in the Coralline Crag.

  --Cryptangia Woodii, Ed. & H. This genus is extinct, and the second

species of it is a form very like the Crag species ; it is from the Ealuus, and,

like the Crag species, is imbedded in a Cellepore. The septal arrangement of

the species is rather abnormal, and there is an evident tendency to revert to

some old type in which the quaternary arrangement prevailed. The genus is

closely aUied to Rhizangia and to Cijlieia. The first of these is extinct, and

flourished in the Lower Chalk of Gosau, in the Eocene, and in the Miocene
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

and the last is recent, its species living in the South-African and Austrahan

seas.

    Balanophyllia calyeulus, "Wood, is represented in the Southern British

seas by B. regia, Gosse, to which it is closely allied. The Mediterranean
species is not closely allied ; and the same may be said for the Cape-of-Good-
Hope B. capensis, Verrill, and the Miocene B. cylindrica. The species is
found in the Red Crag, and the specimens are usually very badly preserved

about the calice. The genus is fully noticed in the report on the Fossil

Corals of the Bi-ockenhui-st beds.

    It will thus appear that three out of the four genera of Crag corals are
represented in the existing seas of our coasts by more or less closely allied
species. One genus is extinct.

   The fine Stejihanophyllia Nysti of the Black Crag of Antwerp is not found

in the British Crags.

--80 REPORT 1868.

   Judging from the conditions surrounding the existing species and their
allies, it might be asserted that no very great bathjTnetrical or climatal
changes have taken place between the deposit of the Crag and the present
lime. The intervention of a long glacial period is not proved by the study of
the corals. But doubtless during that period migration to deep water or to

the south occurred. When the cold period was succeeded by more temperate

times a return of the fauna took place ; and it must be remembered that two
opportunities at least were thus given for variation in form.

Fossil Corals from Brockenhurst.

                           Lower Oligocekte.

   Before 1866 no species of corals were known to exist in any beds between

the top of the Barton series of the Eocene and the base of the " Crag." I

published in that year, in the Supplement to the British Fossil Corals,

Palseontographical Society's vol. for 1865, descriptions of thirteen species of

corals from Brockenhurst in Hampshire. The species were, with the exception,

of two, new to science, and indicated very different external conditions to those

prevailing at the time of the deposition of the Bracklesham and Barton corals.

Moreover the two species which had been desci'ibed from foreign sources

also indicated a very different state of things from those favourable to the life

of the tiny simple Turhinolice of the Loudon Clay and of the Barton series.

The facies of the whole collection was clearly intermediate between the

Eocene and the Falunian coral-faunae. The species were collected from beds

which are distinctly represented in White Cliff' Bay, and which belong to

the Middle Headon series.

Overlying freshwater remains (the Lower Headon), it is evident that great

marine and terrestrial changes had occurred subsequently to the estuarine

conditions prevailing towards the end of the deposition of the Barton

series. The genera of the corals discovered at Brockenhurst prove that the

conditions inseparable from a coral-reef succeeded those favourable to the

development of estuarine and freshwater species of moUusca. The existing

species of such genera as Madrejyora and Solenastrcea are reef-dweUers, and

Axopora and Litharcea are represented in modem reefs by PocUhpora and

Porites. Such genera as BcdanophylUa and Lohopsammia were and are

dwellers in from 20 to 100 or more fathoms, and are found in the deeper

Awater, close to the reefs.  corresponding succession occurs in North Ger-

many, and deep seams of fossil wood are covered with marine deposits of the

same relative age as the marine bed at Brockenhurst. Both the marine

deposits are covered with greater or less depths of sands and gravels. The

moUuscan fauna of Brockenhurst has much in common with those of the

North German Lower Oligocene deposits superimposed on the fossil-wood

seams of Magdeburg, Berusberg, Aschersleben,Egeln, Helmstedt, andLatdorf

and the British as well as the German deposits are moreover the equivalents

of the " Tongrien Inferieur."

The palaeontology of the deposits has been sufficiently studied to determine

the necessity of their separation in classificatory geology from the Eocene

and Miocene formations. As yet no satisfactory alliances have been deter-

mined to exist between the Ohgocene coral-fauna of North Germany and that

of Brockenhurst. But inasmuch as the moUusca are closely alhed, there is

a great probability of the deep-water, oceanic, and reef tracts having been to

the west of the North German littoral tracts.

   The species of tlie genus Solenastrcea from Brockenhurst form a very in-
teresting series, wluch might almost be made a subgenus. The high septal
number in conjunction with the highly inclined endotheca and the defective
columella characterize the group. The species described by Reuss from the

Castelgomberto district, and those from Ghent and Touraine by MM. Milne-

Edwards and Jules Haime, are very distinct from the Brockenhurst species.

Those I have published in my ' West-Indian Fossil Corals,' and a species

noticed by Michelotti and Duchassaing, from St. Thomas's, are equally

remotely allied to the British forms.

  --The recent Solenastrcece are world-wide the Hed Sea, the Indian Ocean,

and the Caribbean Sea being their favoiuite localities.
    The Madreporce from Brockenhurst arc very interesting species, for fossil

forms of the genus are very rare. Madrepora Solanderi, Defrance, was

known as a form from Anvert and Valmondois ; but it appears to me that

the correct geological age of the deposit whence it and another coral (also

common to the Brockenhurst, viz. Lobopsammia eariosa) came is not free from

doubt. It is not improbable that they are true Oligocene corals, especially
as the last-named species is identical with Lohopsammia dilatata, Rdmer,
from Latdorf.

    Madrepora Anglicais a grand form, with a great trunk and short branches,
equalling in size any of the most luxuriant recent species. It is allied to

Madrepora crassa, Ed. & H., from the Pacific and Southern oceans. The
genus comprehends nearly 100 species now flourishing · but the fossil forms

 are only eight in number. The recent species are found, for the most part,
in the boiling surf of the reef, in every part of the globe where the condi-

 tions for reefs exist.

    A.vopora is a genus which has absorbed the genus Holarcea. The species
 have very rudimentary septa, enormous columellse, well developed tabulae,
 and a reticulate ccenenchyma. The species are found in the Eocene of
 Great Britain and France, and at Brockenhurst, and they are all closely

 allied.

     Litharcea Broclcenhursti is remotely allied to the species from the Brac-
 klesham beds and the French and the Javan tertiaries. The genus is extinct
 but the Brockenhurst species, although not the latest in geological age, points
 to Goniophora, a large recent genus of Pacific and Ped-Sea corals.

     The species of BalanopliyUia from Brockenhurst, like that from Brackles-
 ham, has no epitheca, but its large base, distinct costre, and veiy granular sur-
 face render it easily distinguishable. Keuss, F. Romer, and Philippi have
 described species from the Lower Marine Sand of Weinheim and Latdorf; but
 they are not closely allied to the species under consideration.

     As the genus is present in the whole of the Cainozoic coraUiferous beds
 of Great Britain, and is represented in the existing South British and
 Mediterranean seas, the following Table may be useful concerning its divi-

  sions.

                         Notice of the Species.

Turhinolia sulcata, Lamarck, is found in the Eocene deposits at Grignon,

Hauteville, and Ghent, and is not found, I believe, in higher beds than the

Bracklesham in England. The other species are purely British. T. Prest-

&wichii, Ed. H., is probably the oldest form, and T. sulcata and T. Bixoni

are next in age. The remaining species come from the Barton beds. With

the exception of the occm-rence of T. sulcata in the Parisian Eocene, there is

little to connect these Turbinolise with others. The genus is not represented

in the great Nummulitic coral-fauna of the South of Erance, the North

Aof Italy, or of Sindh.  species is found in the Eocene of Alabama ; and

three species, characterized by very bad specimens, were determined from

forms found in the Lower Oligocene deposits of Germany. The genus is

extinct.

   The genus Leptocyathus is one of those artificial groups which surround the
great genus Trochocyathus. It is closely allied to StepJianocyathus, Seguenza
and indeed the only distinction between these two genera is the distribution
of the pali before certain septa. Doubtless some further information will
enable those interested in the classification of the Zoantharia to make the
genera Leptocyathiis and Stephanocyathus mere subgenera of TrocJiocyathus.
L. elegans is a very beautiful form ; and the structure of its base is a curious
instance of symmetry and simplicity of structure, producing in a coral which
doubtless was a dweller in deepish water and on an oozy bottom, great per-

fection of ornamentation.
   There is a second species, L. Atalayensis, D'Archiac, sp., from the Eocene

of Biarritz ; but there is some doubt about its genus.
   The Trochocyathi of the British Eocene are insignificant species of the

great genus which is so fully represented in the Sindhian and European

Nummulitic series. I have noticed in my ' Supplement to the British Fossil

Corals,' Part I., that it is doubtful if T. sinuosus was ever found in England,
and I have described two new species.

   One of these, T. Austeni, Duncan, is the representative in the Brackles-

ham deposits of &T. elongatus, Ed. H., of the Eocene of Quartier-du-Yit

(Basses Alpes) ; but T. insignis, Duncan, so readily distinguishable by its
costal ornamentation and wavy spino-granulose septa, is very solitary as
regards its affinities. The Trochocyathi commenced in the Jurassic period,
culminated in the Miocene, and are extinct, being represented by the Cary-
ophyllice of the Pliocene and recent coral-faunae.

   There are several genera of perforate corals in the British Eocene. Four
genera of these belong to the Eupsammidce, one to the Turbinarince, and
two to the Poritidcv.

   The Eupsammian genera are :

Stephanopbyllia.                             Dendropbyllia.
Balanopbyllia.                               Stereopsammia.

   The StephanophyllicB are Cyclolitoid Eupsammidce, and range from the

"White Chalk to the Pliocene.
   The Cretaceous species form a group readily distinguished from the Ter-
                                                                              --

tiary forms ; and these have a calicular and columeUary structure which forms

them into a subgroup.

The Eocene species is distantly allied to S. elegans from the Miocene of

Tortona. The genus is extinct.

The BalanophyUia, from the Bracklesham beds, is readily distinguished

from the Crag species by its having no epitheca. This is one of the oldest

species of the genus, whose species are found also in the Paris Eocene, and

in the Nummulitic strata of Port-des-Basques. The recent species are

British, South African, and Pacific (20 to 80 fathoms).

The new species, DendrophyUia elegans, nobis, is one of the most beautiful

corals ever discovered. The elegant branching and gemmation, the graceful

costal curvature and granulation, and the symmetrical repetition of the septal

cycles render the coral an object of great interest. Its nearest ally is D.

&yracills, Ed. H., of the Chinese seas, a dweller in twenty-five fathoms

water. The Miocene and Pliocene species of the genus are well marked
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

and the recent species are found in the Mediterranean Sea, in the sea otf

Cadiz and Madeira, and in the Chinese, Pacific, and AustraHan seas. The

most vigorous species are from Cadiz and Madeira, Dendrojihyllia ramea

living there in twenty-five to eighty fathoms.

   Stereopsammia is a genus with only one species ; and this was determined
from the study of a very good compound corallum in the Bracklesham beds.

It is interesting to note that a genus appeared in the Upper Sicilian Ter-

tiaries (and has many species in the Australian, New-Zealand, and Chinese
seas, besides some off Panama and in the Pacific coral-sea, »fec.) which is

closely allied to Stereopsammia, for its only distinction is the existence of a

columella in its species. Both the genera are very erratic members of their

subfamily, for the peculiar Eupsammian direction of the septa is not noticed

either in Stereopsammia or in Coenoptsammia.

The aporose condition of the lower part of the corallites of Stereopsammia,

and their perforated calicular ends, taken into consideration with the pecu-

liarity of the septal direction, prove that the genus links the Eupsammince

amongst the perforate corals with the Aporosa.

   The genus Dendracis has hitherto been little known. MM. Milne-Edwards

and Jules Haime described the first species, out of the Madrepora Gervilii of
Defrauce, from the Hauteville beds ; but no species was known to be of
British growth. Whilst examining the Dixon collection in the British Museum,

I found a species, D. Lonsdalei, nobis. Very recently Peusshas described:

D. seriata, Castelgomberto ; D. mammiUosa, Castelgomberto ; D. Haidingeri,

Oberburg and Java ; and D. nodosa, Oberburg. D'Achiardi has also described

a species from the Castelgomberto district.

Lonsdale was correct in his diagnosis of his Porites panicea ; and it is a

most interesting species, for it is a true Porites and a perforate coral. The

form has its septa less spieulate and more lamellate than is usual in the

Porites, moreover the coenenchyma is very decided. This Eocene species has

thus characteristics of the genera Porites, Astrceopora, and Litharcea.

Eeuss has described Porites nimimiditica, Oberburg ; P. minuta, Castel-

gomberto                                     P. incrassata,  Java, tertiary.  This last species is closely allied
                                          ;

to Porites panicea.

Some years since, I described a Porites from the Lower (Hippurite) Lime-

stone of Jamaica. Our knowledge of the genus, therefore, extends from the
Lower Chalk to the present day. The Miocene forms and the recent are the

most numerous. Asfra^opora panicea, Ed. & H., must give way to the original

species, Porites panicea, Lonsdale. The Astrceoporce flourished in the Castel-

gomberto deposits. The genera Axopora and lAtharcea have been noticed in
the report on the Brockenhurst corals. The first genns represented the

Milleporidce in the Eocene.

  --The five species of Paracyaihus from the British Eocene are :

Paracyathus crassus, Ed. Sf H.        Paracyathus Haimei, Duncan.
                                              cylindricus, Duncan.
         caryophyllus, Lonsdale, sp.

      brevis, Ed. # H.

P. caryophyllus is found in the Jamaican Eocene, and is closely allied to
P. cylindricus. P. crassus and P. Haimei are also allied.

   It is doubtful whether the genus should be considered more than a sub-
genus of the great genus TrocJiocyathus. There are recent species in the
Mediterranean and in the West Indies. They are found at a depth of from

fifteen to eighty fathoms.

   M. de Eromentel has described a species of the extraordinary Eocene
genus Basmia, from the Neocomian of St. Dizier. The genus stands by

itself, unless the opinion of MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime be ad-

mitted to be correct, viz. that each lamina is a septum. To carry this
opinion further would place the genus amongst the Eupsammidce.

    The OcuUnidce are represented in the British Eocene by two genera and

four species.

Oculina conferta, Ed. 8c H.           Oeulina Wetherelli, Duncan.
        incrustans, Duncan.           Diplohelia papillosa, Ed. S( H.

The three species of Oculina belong to a subdivision of the genus in which,

the calices are distributed without order, the costal striae being rudimentary

or absent. Ocidina conferta has some analogy with Oculina Halensis, Duncan,
from the nummulitic limestone of Sindh ; but the Sindhian coral has its
calices arranged in a serial order. The genus flourished in the Miocene and
Pliocene periods, and is represented in almost every coralliferous sea by

species living either in tolerably deep water or at a very great depth.
   Diplohelia is an extinct genus, and characterizes Tertiary deposits. There

is a species, D. raristella, Defrance, sp., in the Eocene of Paris and Biarritz.
In the corresponding deposits of Lacken there is D. multistellata, Galeotti,
sp. The Miocene species from the Sicilian Tertiaries have lately been de-
scribed by Seguenza ; and D. reflexa, Michelotti, sp., is from Superga. The

great devolopment of the columella in Diplohelia separates the genus from its
nearest ally Astrohelia, whose species are Miocene forms from the Faluns and
from Maryland. The transition between the genera is through Astrohelia Le-

sueuri, Ed. & H., from the American Walnut-HiU Miocene. This species has

a small, lax, and spongy columella, and its closest afiinity is with the Diplo-
helia witb costal striae. M. Milne-Edwards remarks that Astrohelia (thus

united with Diplohelia) is a passage from between tbe OcuUnidce and the
Astrmdce, particularly in relation to tbe Cladanyia;, a Miocene genus. The
affinity between Olaclangia and the recent Astrangince is evident.

   The genera Styloccenia and Astrocoenia have been removed from the

Eusmilinai to the Astraince in consequence of the discovery that their septa

are dentate.

   Styloccenia emarciata has an immense geological range. It characterizes
the Eocene of Jamaica, Sindh, Italy, France, and England.

   S. monticidaria is common to the French and British Eocene beds. (See

remarks on the genus in the report on the fossil corals of the Lias.)

   Astrocoenia is a very important secondary genus ; its peculiarities are fully
discussed in the Eeport on the Fossil Corals of the Lias. There are three

species in the Eocene, but only one is British. Reuss has lately described
                                                                                    .

--86 REPORT 1868.

two species from the Castelgomberto district. The genus became extinct
in the Miocene age.

   The smaller Heliastraeans and Astrseans appear to represent these genera

in the recent coral-faunae.

   It may be assumed, from our knowledge of the habits of the representatives

of the Eocene species in the existing seas, that the bulk of the fauna lived
on oozy sea-bottoms, at a depth of from 10 to 100 fathoms. Such a sea (as
regards its depth, bottom, and magnitude, but not as regards its temperature)
as has been di-edged off Unst, or the Southern China Sea, where there are no
reefs, might resemble that which contained the old Turhinolice, Trochocyatlii,
Paracyathi, Oculince, Stephano^hyllice, Balanophyllice, Dendropliyllice, and

Stereopsammice.

   The genera Stylocoenia, Astrocoenia, Dendracis, Pontes, LWiarcea, and Axo-
pora were probably located on small reefs, or in shallower water than the
others. The fauna, as a whole, is insignificant, and bears a very feeble re-
lation to the magnificent Eocene Coral-fauna of Castelgomberto, the South of
France, and Sindh. These were the coral-tracts of the period, and were full
of great reefs, whose corals are represented uow-a-days by large and quickly

growing species.
   The immense break between the Upper Chalk and the British coralliferous

Eocene deposits is proved by the total difference of their coral-faunae.
   The scanty relationship between the British Eocene and Lower Oligocene

coral-faunae has already been noticed. Part of the British Eocene coral-fauna

is represented by species now living in the British, Spanish, and Mediter-

ranean seas, and the rest by species in the Pacific and East-Inchan oceans.
The slight affinity between the British Eocene and the recent West-Indian
coral-faunae is therefore worthy of notice.

from these formations. One of these species had been previously described
by Mantell, and another by Reuss; but seven species were added to our
British fauna through the industry of the great French zoophytologists.

   During the last few mouths I have thoroughly examined the specimens

offered to me, and those which had been studied by MM. Milne-Edwards and

Jules Haime, Lonsdale, and ManteU. I can add ten new species to the list of
the corals from the White Chalk, and five good varieties of formerly known

species. It is necessary also to admit a species of Mr. Lonsdale's, and to

The list of species presents a remarkable assemblage of forms. The Caryo-

phyllice are represented in existing seas, especially in from low spring-tide

level to 80 or 100 fathoms, in the West Indies, tbe Mediterranean, and in

the south-east and north-east British seas. They are, with one exception

(the  Caryopliyllia  Smythi),  always  dwellers in  many  fathoms                                      and this coral

is evidently a littoral variety of C. horealis. Tbe Oculinidce of the present day

are usually found under the same conditions as ihe'CaryojphylUoe ; and doubt-

less the ParasiniU(ea,nd Trocliosmilice were dwellers in from 10 to 100 fathoms.

There are no forms which indicate shallow waters, or anything like a reef.

The fauna is essentially a deep-sea one.

   The continental development of Cretaceous corals is very remarkable ; and

the horizon of Gosavx and Martigues, probably that of our Lower White Chalk

Aand part of the Upper Greensand, is characterized by the reef species.

more decided equivalency between the higher horizons of the Upper Chalk of

the continent and the Norfolk beds has been established by the discovery of

some of the species now noticed for the first time.

   MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime adopted for a coral from the Upper

Chalk the name of Cyathin-a Icevigata. They published this name in their
" Monog. des Turlinohdes," Ann. des Sciences Nat. 3rd series, vol. ix. p. 20
(1848), and in their " Monograph of the Corals of the Upper Chalk," Pal.
8oc. 1850. Lonsdale named the same coral Monocarya centralis, Dixon,
* Geol. of Sussex,' 1850, and probably Monocarya cidtrata also.

    In 1850 D'Orbigny (Prodr. de Paleont. t. ii. p. 275, 1850) gave the coral
the specific name cylindracea, it having become evident that Eeuss was the
primary discoverer of the species in 1846. In his ' Kreideformation,' p. 61,
pi. 14, figs. 23-30, Eeuss gives the name Anfhophyllium cylindraceum. The
genus of the coral is evidently Caryojphyllia, in' the sense adopted by Charles

Stokes in 1828.

   MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime, having all this information before

them, very properly determined the generic and specific names to be Caryo-

phyllia cylindracea, Eeuss, sp., in their ' Hist. Nat. des CoraU.' vol. ii. p. 18.

    This species is very polymorphic, and the pah of some specimens are very
like the outer terminations of the columellary structures in some Parasmilia.
Very frequently it is hardly possible to determine which are the pah and
which the ends of the columellary fasciculi. Moreover in some specimens
the base is small and the costae reach low down ; whilst in others the base is
normal and large, the costee being abnormal from their length. There is a

Caryophyllia Lonsdalei, Duncan.
   The corallum has a large and incrusting base, and the stem is cyliudro-

conical and straight. There is a slight curve near the base. The calice is
circular, small, not very open, and moderately deep. The columella is small,
and is terminated by rod-shaped processes. The septa are slightly exsert,
the primary especially. There are three complete cycles ; and the septa of
the higher orders of the fourth cycle are not developed in every system. The
primary, secondary, and tertiary septa are very much alike. They have a
wavy inner edge and are granulated. The pali are situated before the ter-
tiary septa, and are knob-shaped, and rather flat from side to side. The costse
are nearly equal at the calicular margin, and pass downwards as flat, band-
like prominences, separated by shallow intercostal grooves. They are con-
tinued to the base, but are hidden midway by an epithecal growth.

   The corallum has a large base, a curved cylindrical stem, and an inclined

elliptical calice. It is short in relation to its broad base. The calice is open
and shallow. The columella is small, and terminates in twelve knob-shaped
endings to the fasciculi. The septa are unequal, and there are five incom-
plete cycles. The laminae are marked with curved lines of granules, are wavy
and unequal. The pali are longer than the columellary processes, are wavy,
flattened, and curved. The costse are subequal in the upper third, but are

This species is mimetic of Parasmilia serpentinn, Ed. & H., from the same

geological horizon, just as Thecosmilia cylindrica is of Parasmilia cylindrita.

The Stylotrochi of the Cambridge Upper Greensand are closely allied to the

Upper-Cretaceous form.

                        Family ASTR^ID.E.

                        Genus Teochosmilia.

                                           Subgenus Coelosmilia.

    It is a great question whether Coelosmilia can stand as a g-enus. It is im-
possible to separate its species from those of Trochosmilia by an external
examination ; and sections prove that there is no columella and a vejy
scanty endotheca. Still there is an eudotheca ; and the visceral cavity is not
open from top to bottom, as in the Turbinolidcr. It is true that there is a

facies common to the Cctlosmilice, and that they are a natural group ; but in

fact they would not differ from a well-known Trocliosmilia with scanty endo-

theca, were there such a species. On studying the genus Trochosmilia, it will
be noticed that many of its species have never been described with reference
to their endotheca. Many were determined from one or two specimens, and
sections of the majority have not been taken. Now Trochosmilia sulcata,
Ed. & H., has very little endotheca ; it is a species from the Gault, and the

Coelosmilice are aU from the Upper Cretaceous, Eocene, and recent coral-faunae.

In placing Coelosmilia as a subgenus, but included in Trochosmilia, it must bo
admitted that the classification becomes simpler and more natural. Since

MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime published their ' Hist. Nat. des Coral-

liaires'some new species oi Ccelosmilia have been published or described.

pertain to other species, or are reaUy indeterminable.

some septa of the fifth cycle, are ;

    In examining good specimens of this species I found the fourth cycle

of septa to be present. Its laminae are small, but decidedly visible ; conse-

quently the calice, as drawn by MM. Mibie-Edwards and Jules Hairae, ' Mo-

nog. Brit. Eoss. Corals,' pt. 1. tab. viii. fig. -ic, is incori-ect. The following

description will apply to the three varieties of the species.

    Varieti/ 1. The corallum is conico-cylindrical and straight. The eostse are
intensely granular inferiorly, and two large costas are separated by three
smaller. Near the calice the larger costse have a wavy cristifoi-m ridge upon
them, the intermediate costse being very granular, with clievron patterns, or

thej^ may be moniliform. At the calicular margin the costae are nearly flat

and granular. The fourth cycle of septa is distinct.
    Vanety 2. Inferiorly, in structure as varieti/ 1. Superiorly the principal

costse are very cristiform, and weU marked with a secondary ridge. The

chevron pattern of the intermediate costae are very distinct.

    Varieti/ 3. Costae inferiorly wavy and sparely granidar. Superiorly the
costae are subcristiform and plain, the continuity of the crests being defective.
The intermediate arc broken and moniliform, and here and there chevroned.

Trocliosmilia (Coelosmilia) cornucopics, Duucan.

    The corallum is strongly curved in the plane of the smaller axis, and it is
compressed superiorly, and is finely pedunculate. The growth-rim's and
swellings are moderately developed. The costaj are subequal above and
cristate, and unequal interiorly. The septa are numerous and very unequal.
There are five cycles of septa, and six systems. The primary septa are very
exsert, and the secondary ones less so. The septa of the fifth cycle are very
small. The calice is elliptical and the fossa very deep, the larger septa join-
ing those opposite at its bottom. There are traces of epitheca.

 _ The corallum is tall, finely pedicellate, and is not compressed. The growth-
rings are distinct. The costte are very distinct and unequal, and they reach
from base to cahce. The smaller intermediate costae are ornamented with
chevrons and horizontal lines. The larger costaj have a secondary crest upon
their free surface. The septa are unequal, slender, and not crowded. The
calice is circular. There are five cycles of septa, but the fifth is incomplete
in some systems. The primary septa are large, slightly exsert, and extend
far inwards. The calicular margin is very thin, and the fossa is deep.

   The corallum is tall, cornute, slightly pedicellate and narrow. The growth-

markings are distinct. The costae are distinct from base to calice. Two

large subcristiform and very distinct costae bound three intermediate small
and more or less monHiform costae. Sets of these costae occur around the

corallum. The septa are crowded, wavy, and unequal ; many unite late-
rally, and the largest reach far into the axial space. The calice is circular,
and the waU is very thin.

 _ The corallum is taU and slightly curved ; it has a long pedicel with a very
distinct base. The corallum is slightly compressed, and bulges here and there.
The costae are well marked, distant, subequal, and intensely granular. The

larger costae are more distinct inferiorly and midway than close to the caK-

cular margin                                                they are cristiform in some places, notched by chevron-shaped

ornamentation in others, and occasionally shar-ply pointed or absent. The

spaces between the larger costae are wide, faintly convex, and are marked

longitudinally by small costae, and transversely by wavy or chevroned orna-

mentation. The whole external surface of the corallum is very granular.
The calicular wall is very thin, and the calice is elliptical. There are three

perfect cycles of septa, and some orders of the fourth cycle in some of the

systems. The septa are wide apart, slightly exsert, unequal, and slender

they do not reach far inwards at once, but dip downwards with a gentle curve.

In a section the inner margin of the lower septa is wavy. The endotheca is

   The corallum is tall, cylindrical, and very slightly bent. The calicular

opening is smaller in diameter than the rest of the corallum. The costae are
nearly equal, broad, slightly crowded, and are separated bj^ shallow, narrow
and undulating intercostal grooves. The costse are profusely ornamented
with transverse ridges, straight, curved, or angular, and with large gi-anules.
The calicular edge is very thin, and the broad convex costse are continuous
with slender unequal septa. The primary are exsert, and the laminse of the
higher orders are very small. There is no columella, the larger septa uniting
by a few short attachments from their inner margins. The endotheca is

scanty.

   The subgenus Coelosmilia is thus represented in the British chalk by one

species formerly known, by three varieties of it, and by five new species :

their presence suggests that the Upper Chalk of Norwich and Trimmingham

is, from the evidence of its corals, as well as from the proofs already adduced

from its MoUusca, on a higher horizon than the Upper Chalk (usually so

called) in the south-eastern district. The coral evidence brings the Norfolk

chalk closer in relation with the Faxoe, Eugen, and Ciply deposits t.
   The affinity between Trochosmilia (C.) comucojnce and Coelosmilia excavata.

Hag., sp., a doubtful form, but weU drawn by Quenstedt, is evident. It is
from Rugen and Moeii. T. Wiltshiri and the species Faujasi, from Ciply, are

also closely allied.

The depth of the space between the calicular margin and the top of the

upper dissepiment in these species indicates that the animal had great mesen-

teric, ovarian, perigastric, and water systems. They were probably very

rapid growers. The wall is merged into the costal system, which is strength-

ened by a most unusual cross-bar and cristiform ornamentation ; and this

development, which is almost epithecal, is complementary to the defective

endotheca.

                                           Genus Pakasmilia.

  --MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime described five species of this genus

from the Upper Chalk, viz.:

1. Parasmilia centralis, Mantell, sp.            4. Parasmilia Fittoni, Ed. ^- H.

2. ManteUi, Ed. # H.                             #5. serpentina, Ed. H.

3. cylindrica, Ed. &f H.

   t With regard to the depth at which Ocidinida and simple corals can live, it has been
discovered by Dr. Carpenter and Prof. Wyville Thompson that they exist at a depth of
530 fathoms.

    P. cylindrica and serpentina are readily distinguished by their external
shape ; but, owing to the polymorphic character of P. centralis, it is by no
means easy to separate it from P. Mantelli and P. Fittoni.

   Parasmilia Mantelli, Ed. & H., was determined from one specimen alone,

&and it is clearly united to P. centralis by P. Gravesana, Ed. Haime, of the

White Chalk of Chalons-sur-Marne and Eeauvais (Oise). This species I have
found in England ; and having had many specimens of P. centralis with costse

like those of P. Mantelli in some parts of the corallum, and normal costse in

others, I consider P. Mantelli a variety of P. Gravesana, and that this last

species is a variety of P. centralis, a good subspecies.

   Parasmilia Fittoni, Ed. & H., has a large columella and a definite struc-

tural distinction in its tertiary costae from P. centralis.

   The new forms I have noticed with the older are shown in the following

list :--

The corallum is long, much cui'ved, and distorted. It is more or less

cylindrical above and contracted here and tliere. Inferiorly it is pedunculate,

the peduncle being small, curved, and long. The costse are nearly equal on

the peduncle; there they are rather subcristiform, a secondary crest being

on the costae                                                        and in the  intercostal                                          spaces there is either a faint ridge or a

moniliform series of granules. The calice is often smaller than the body, and

the wall is very thin. The septa are small ; and there are four cycles, the
last cycle being rudimentary. The columella is small.

   The height varies from | inch to 2 inches, and the diameter from g to f

   The coraUum is tall, nearly straight, finely pedunculate, and cylindro-
conical. The calice is very large, widely open, deep, and has a thin margin.
The columella is well developed. The septa are barely exsert, reach but
slightly inwards, but pass downwards at once. They are very unequal,

alternately large and small, and there are four complete cycles and part of
the fifth. The costae are subequal near the calice, and the broadest are con-

tinuous vrith the smallest septa. On the body the costse are subcristiform
and in sets of four. On the pedicel they are very granular and very distinct.

This species was included by Lonsdale in his genus Monocarya, and was

termed M. centralis. Parasmilia has the priority as a genus ; and the species

is evidently not P. centralis. The position of the genus Parasmilia is some-

what lilve that of Ccelosmilia ; but MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime

have created the genus Cylicosmilia for Parasmiliee with abundant endotheca.

Now in careful sections I have found that P. centralis and its varieties have

endothecal dissepiments reaching close to the calicular fossa. The genus

must  therefore                                                      absorb  Cylicosmilia                                             and  C. Altavilensis,  Defrance,  sp.,  of the

                                      Genus Diblastjs, Lonsdale.

   This genus was established by Lonsdale in Dixon's ' Geol. of Sussex,'
1850, and was described by the learned zoopliytologist with all that critical
acumen which characterizes him, pp. 248 to 254, pi. 18. figs. 14 to 28.

  MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime, whilst they acknowledge the genus

to be " voisin des Synhelia" (Hist, Kat. des Corall. vol. ii. p. 115), do not
give it a place in their classification. I have therefore carefully studied and

drawn the specimens from the Dixon Collection in the British Museum, and
have great pleasure in doing justice to Mr. Lonsdale, by inserting his
genus with slight alterations to meet the present terminology.

                Genus Diblasus, Lonsdale (amended).

   The corallum is incrusting, very irregular in shape ; the calices are wide
apart and projecting ; the intercalicular tissue is costulate. The septa are un-
equal. There are no pali. The columella is formed by the junction of the
larger septa, and does not exist as a separate structure. Gemmation marginal
and intercalicinal. The genus is CAadently not closely allied to Synhelia ; for

it has no palular or true columellary structures. It approaches the genus
Astrohelia, which is a transition genus bringing the Oadinidce in relation with
the Astrceincv, through the Chidangice (Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime,
' Hist. Nat. des Corall.' vol. ii. p. 111).

Diblasiis Grevensis, Lonsdale.

The corallum is very irregular in shape and size. The calices project, and

are irregular in their jn-ojection and size. The costae are granular, equal,

subequal, and unequal in different parts of the same coraUum. ITie septa

are  in  three  cycles,  and  are unequal and dentate                                                                                                                            the  primary reach those

In the British Museum, Dixon Collection.

The condition in which the specimens of this species is found is very

remarkable : the inside of nearly every calice has been worn away, so that

the mural edges of the septa are all that remains of them ; the perfect

calices appear to have shrunk from the surrounding coenenchyma ; and in

many places the costse have been worn off.

                                                 Lower Challc.

   There are several specimens of corals from the Lower Chalk; but I
have not been able to identify them, on account of their fragmentary con-
dition. Onchotrochus serj^entinus is a Lower-Chalk form.

    Trocliosmilia tuberosa, Ed. &II., was found to be without endotheca, and
therefore to be of necessity included amongst the Turhinolidce. The genus
Smilotrochus was determined in order to receive the species.

                            Genus Smilotrochus, Ed. & H.

   The corallum is simple, straight, cuneiform, free, and without trace of for-
mer adhesion. There is no columella, the wall is naked and costulate. There
is no epitheca, and the simple costae are distinct from the base to the calice.

    This is the simplest form of Aporose Zoantharia; and its structures
are confined to a wall, septa, and costce. Flahellum has an epitheea in

addition, and Stylotrochus of De Eromentel is a Smilotrochus with a styliform

columella, the septa uniting also by their thickened internal margins.
Onchotrochws, nobis, has a pellicular epitheca, no columella ; but, like Stylo-

trochus, the septa are united internally.

    This species is described in the ' Hist. Nat. dcs Corall.' vol. ii. p. 71.

   The corallum is regularly cuneiform, very compressed below, and slightly

Numerous specimens of a species of this genus are in the possession of

James Carter, Esq. and the Kev. T. Wiltshire. The species has great resem-

Ablance to the lower part of Onchotrochus serpentin^is, nobis.  cai'eful ex-

amination of sections and calicos proves that there is no columella, that the

inner ends of the septa produce a false one, and that the styloid appearance

is due to fossilization.

OnhotrocJius Carter!, Duncan.
   In the young corallum there is a flat and round expansion at the base, by

which it was attached to foreign substances ; but this is lost as growth proceeds.
The corallum is either straight or slightly curved, is taU, very slender, conico-
cylindrical, clavate, and enlarged here and there. Unworn specimens are
more or less angular in transverse outline. The costae are angular projec-
tions, extend from base to calice, are subequal, wide apart, and are connected
and covered with a fine pellicular epitheca, Avhich readily disappears. Growth-
mai'kin^s very common. The cahce is circular and shallow. The septa are
short at the wall, and wedge-shaped ; they are roimded inferiorly, and do not
extend far inwards. There are twelve septa, and they are subequal. The
septa in sections often appear equal, and their inner ends are joined, and the
axial space is filled up by a deposit of coral-structure. But the reverse is

the case occasionally, and the irregularity of the septa may be well seen.

The septa are continuous with the costse.

   The discovery of better sjiecimens may perhaps lead M. de Fromentel to
consider his StyhtrocJim, which so resembles this form, to be of the same

genus.

                                  Genus Cyathophora, Michelin.

   This genus has the usual characters of compound Astraeinae ; but the dis-
sepiments act as tabute, and shut in the calice below, just as in some of the
Liassic Tsastr<v(r. There is no columella*. Curved dissepiments are not
noticed ; and the family of the genus must remain unsettled, for the minute
structure is clearly tabulate. The genus flourished in the Lower and Middle
Oolites ; and the only Cretaceous species is that under consideration, and

--which has been described by D'Orbigny from the Craie Tuffen, Les Martignes
    Cijathophora monticularia, D'Orb., sp.
   The septa are rather thick. There are three cycles, but the third is often
deficient in one or two systems.

  --MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime thus notice this species (Hist. Xat.

   " M. Jlichelin's specimen is very young. It is encircled by a strongly

folded epitheca, which is formed of two layers. No columella is distinguish-

able. The septa are tolerably strong and unequal. There are three cycles,
with the rudiments of a fourth in one or two systems."

   The superposition of the calices is remarkable ; and I cannot but place a

this species.

Fossil Corals from the Red Chalk of Hunstanton.

   The Red Chalk of Hunstanton contains several forms of Madreporaria. The

small fauna has this peculiarity ; its species belong to the group of Fungida)

without exception. The specimens are small, usually much worn at the
cahcular end, and are readily distinguished by their mammiliform appearance

and white colour.

There are no compound Fungidae in the Red Chalk, but such small, simple

forms as would now characterize the presence of physical conditions unfavour-

able for coral-life. The recent simple Fimgidse are found at all depths ; vast

numbers of them are to be collected in the Gosau Lower Chalk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           a few existed

coral-fauna ; none are found in the West- Indian seas, whilst the Red Sea"^

Pacific, and Indian oceans abound with them. It is probable that peculiar

conditions are necessary for their development.

few species ai'e found in the White Chalk, in the Eocene, and Miocene. There

are some doubtful Neocomiaii species ; and the genus is extinct.

Cyclolltes polymorpha, Goldfuss, sp.
   The corallum is very irregular in shape, generally subelliptical, and not

very tall. The highest point of the calice is subcentral, and the central
fossula is very variable in its place. The septa are very numerous, thin, close,
flexuous, crenulate, and larger in front.

   The solitaiy S2)ecimen of this form is small, but the fossula and septa are

tolerably distinct.

Genus PoDOSEEis, Duncan.

The corallum has a large concave base, by which it is attached to foreign

bodies. The epitheca commences at the basal margin, and is stout and

reaches the calicular margin. The height of the corallum varies. The calice

is generally smaller than the base, and is convex. The sepia are numerous

and unequal, the largest reaching the rudimentary columella. The central

fossula is circular and small.  The costas are seen when the epitheca is worn
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

they are distinct, connected by synapticulae, and are straight.

The genus has been created to admit Micrabacice with adherent bases and

more or less of a peduncle.

Podoseris mammiUlformls, Duncan.
   The corallum is short, straight, and broad. The base is concave, and is

either larger than the calice, or there is a constriction immediately above it,
and it is slightly smaller than the caHce. The calice is round, convex,

depressed in the centre, and is bounded inferiorly by the epitheca. The
laminae are stout, unequal, curved superiorly, and often join. There are five
cycles in six systems, the last cycle being very rudimentary. The synapti-
culae are numerous. The costas are straight and subequal, and are smaller
than the septa. The ornamentation of the septal and costal apparatus varies
and there may be an almost moniliform series of enlargements on the septa,
or they may be plain. The cohimella is formed principally by the ends of
the longest septa. The height of the corallum appears to be determined by
the growth of the body between the base and the calice.

   Monstrosities are often found amongst specimens of this species.

Podoseris eJonr/ata, Duncan.
   The corallum is tall, a broad circular and shghtly concave base, a long

conico-cylindrical stem, and a small calice much narrower than the base. The
epitheca is in bands. The costae are alternately large and very small, some-
what distant, wavy, and united by synapticute, many of which are oblique.
ON THE BRITISH FOSSIL CORALS.  99

The septa frequently unite by their axial ends to each other, the short to the
long. There appear to be five cycles of septa. The base of the corallum has
a cellular tissue, probably from the fossihzation of some body to which it was

adherent.

                                         Corals from the Lias.

   When MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime wrote their ' Monograph of

the British EossO. Corals' (Pal. Soc.),;only onegood species was known asLiassic.
There was a great palajontological break between the coral-faunse of the In-
ferior Oolite and of the Mountain-limestone. The distinction between the
Palaeozoic and Jurassic coral-fauna3 was so great that any student of the Mc-
sozoic Zoantharia appeared to enter another Madreporarian world when the
Carboniferous forms were presented to his notice. On leaving the study of the

Monilivaltice, Thecosmilm, Isastrcece, and other familiar Secondary genera, and
entering upon the investigation of such genera as Cuatliophylhmi, Lithostro-

tion, Loiisdalia, and AnijAexus, a new classificatory philosophy had to be com-
prehended, and it required much experience in the habit of determining

species before the foreshadowing of the Secondary forms could be appreciated
in the Palaeozoic. The break was produced by the very uncoraUiferous na-
ture of the Permian strata, the absence of any corals from the Trias in this
countrj , and the solitary species from the Lias.

   Of late years the distinction between the Pala:ozoic and Oolitic coral-fauna
of continental Europe has been lessened by the careful study by Laube and
Reuss of the Triassic coralliferous limestones, and by De Fromentel, Eerry,
Terquem,Piette, and Stoppani of the corals oi VaQ Avicula-contorta zone, and
of the strata sometimes called lufraUas, in which Ammonites planorhis and
A. angidatus are found. The Palaeozoic genera said to be found in the Mus-
chelkaUi and in the St.-Cassian beds were proved by Laube to be Secondary,
and the small coral-fauna of the Lias below the zone of Ammonites BucLIandi
(bisulcatits) was determined to be decidedly Jurassic in its affinities. The
break was thus narrowed ; but it was nevertheless very great ; for the absence
of any satisfactory assemblage of forms in the Permian formation and in the
Muschelkalk rendered the aspect of the Carboniferous specific group very

foreign to the student of the lowest Mesozoic corals.

   Some recent discoveries of Permian corals in Iforth America do not help to

diminish this break.

   The practical geologist will readUy appreciate the vast physical changes which
intervened between the Mountain -limestone and the Avicula-contorta beds in
this country. The depth of the Permian magnesiau and sandy deposits and
of the Bunter on the Continent and its limestone (Muschelkalk), and that of
the Keuper and its St.-Cassian and Kossen sti'ata, will strike all who know
that corals are the rarest of specimens in this pile of deposits ; so that when
the admirable condition of preservation of the Carboniferous corals and of
those from the Lower Lias is considered, the imperfection of the record ap-
pears to be immense.

   The earliest evidences of the existence of Secondary corals in this country are
the casts of simple forms, probably oi Monilivaltice from the Avicula-contorta
beds, and the casts and coraUites of Montlivaltice and the Thecosmilice from the
100 HEPORT-- 18G8.

true White Lias. As the balance of the Palfeontological evidence is in favour

of these beds being younger than the Trias, they must be considered the

feebly coralliferous strata of the Rhaetic strata, or of the Infralias, or Lower

Lias, according to the taste of the student of dogmatic systematic geology.

The deposits containing Avicula contorta in England, Wales, and Ireland are

not of that physical and mineralogical character which attends corallifeious

sediments                                                     and the assemblage of  other  organisms is  not  that wliich  usually

accompanies coral life.

  A cast of a Montlivultia was discovered in the Avicida-contorta zone, by

Charles Moore, P.G.S. ; and it is therefore an interesting fossil ; for, except the

few Permian specimens, there are no corals known in Great Eritain between

this cast and the Madreporaria of the Carboniferous.

Throughout Europe the strata containing Avicula contorta are generally

uncoralliferous ; but the great deposits at Azzarola have an old coral-bank.

These were the coral-reef areas of the period, jiist as the Gosau and Mar-

tigues were the coral-reef areas of the Lower Chalk, and as the Dax and

Caribbean strata were the coral-reef areas of the Miocene.

The White Lias of Great Britain and Ireland is a local deposit which is

intercalated between the beds containing Avicukt contorta and those consti-

tuting the zone of Ammonites planorhis (or its equivalent Ammonite, such as

A, Burgunclice). It is absent on the continent, the Ammonites planorhis (or

its equivalent deposit) succeeding the beds with Avicula contorta. The White

Lias is very uncoraUiferoua ; and I have never seen a perfect specimen of a

Madreporarian from it. The White Lias of Watehet contains imperfect

AMontlivaltice and stunted conico- cylindrical Thecosmilice.                                                   cast of a The-

cosmilian from Sparksfield resembles that of a species found in the deposits

above the White Lias in the zone of Ammonites-planorhis and A. anr/uhdiis.

A large Montlivaltia from the White Lias near Leamington has an ellipti-

Acal calice ; but it is not possible to give it a specific determination.                                                   cast of

a multiseptate discoidal Montlivaltia is found at Punt HiU, Warwickshire ; it

resembles that of Montlivaltia Haimei, Chapuis et Dewalque. Corals of this

type are common in the Ammonitcs-plctnorhis beds of the east of PVance and

Luxembourg, but they do not appear to have existed in England until the

zone of Ammonites angulatus. This species, having a range from the east of

France to the west of England and Ireland, is very variable in its form and

in some structural detaUs.

It is evident from an examination of the MoUusca of the White Lias, that

it was a deposit not likely to have corals located in it. The stunted Theco-

smilice and discoid Montlivalticp, have no congeners now existing ; but many

genera of simple corals of tubular form are frequenters of the sea-bottom

from 100 fathoms to the lowest spring-tide range.

The coral-fauna of this deposit is unimportant, and even that of the next

series of beds, those containing Ammonites planorhis, is small; but when the

strata in which Ammonites angulatus existed was examined, a large and veiy

varied assemblage of species, indicating old coral-reefs, as well as deep-water

conditions, was proved to exist. In South Wales a reef hung on to the

Mountain -limestone coast ; and in the Noi'th of Ireland, as well as in the

Lincolnshire area, subhttoral and deep-water forms flourished. Changes

occurred in the physical geography of these areas, and an arenaceous series

of deposits containing Gryphcea incurva and Ammonites BacJclancli succeeded

the Welsh deposits just mentioned, and the deeper sea-beds of the east and

west. The alteration in the sea-depth due to the lowering of these areas

produced not only an alteration in the mineralogy of the strata, but great
                ON THE BRITISH FOSSIL CORALS.           101

modifications iu the faunae, especially as regards the corals. The arenaceous

limestones situated upon the coralliferous dolomitic limestones of the old

"Welsh reef contain a feeble coral assemblage, and present no evidence of the

Aexistence of coral reefs.  great number of Mollusca are found in the depo-

sits ; some existed during the deposition of both, and others were limited in
their range to one or the other ; but the bathymetrical changes gave the corals
no chance, and doubtless the reef species died out, their ova finding no rest-

ing place on that particular area.

   The zones which succeeded Ammonites BucMandi appear to have been

unfavourable to certain forms of corals, especially to those which collect

together in vast tracts, forming varieties of reefs. The modern representa-

tives of the species found in the Liassic strata above the zone of Ammonites
angulatus indicate deep water (30 to 100 fathoms). Where the reefs of the

period were is certainly not determinable.

The corals of the Middle and Upper Lias are very rare.

The corals contained in the Liassic strata of Britain, France, Germany,

and Italy have a very decided community of facies ; at the same time it is

evident that some portions of the Liassic coral-fauna resemble Triassic types,

and that another portion is allied to the Oohtic.

This was to have been expected ; for it is evident that the stunted Theco-

smi.lice and the Astroccenioe of the zone of Ammonites angulatus are the de-

scendants of the equally stunted Thecosmilice, and Astrocoenice of the Triassic

age. Moreover the descendants of the Isastrcece and of the larger Montli-

valtice of the Lower and Middle Lias luxuriated in the Oolitic seas. The bulk,

however, of the Liassic coral-fauna is charactciistic of and special to the

formation, and, as is the case in the other great series of strata, certain as-

semblages of species appear to characterize certain definite horizons. Yet

not unexceptiouably ; for some species range into higher zones in certain

areas, whilst others, which are confined to a definite horizon in one area, ai-e

found below and above the equivalents of the horizon in a distant locaUty.

Thus a species which is only foimd in a particular bed, and is associated with

a particular molluscan fauna in one locahty, may be found associated with a

moUuscan fauna antecedent or subsequent in its recognized succession in

another place.

The persistence of a species in a succession of deposits and its consecutive

association with different groups of contemporaries and competitors is con-

stantly observed in the Lias.

The groups of Madreporaria have a general relation to certain zones of

life and to certain strata, besides very definite relations to others. It is not

probable that corals and Ammonites had any close biological relations, but

only those of a general nature ; but corals were certainly en rapport with

certain molluscan genera, especially with lithodomous groups ; so that when

corals of the Lias are said to belong to such and such a zone of Ammonites, it

is to serve the purpose of the artificial but very necessary classificatory system

of geology. If the Madreporaria are associated with certain Ammonite zones,

it must be understood that it is only an approximative classification, and that

the Ammonites and the Madreporaria may range higher than their supposed

restricted zone, or not even be j-epresented in certain portions of its area.

There are a few Triassic species in the Liassic coral-fauna, and the branch-

ing corals of the Sutton stone have generally a Triassic facies. The majority

of the corals of the Lower Liassic strata are peculiarized by the imperfection

of the septal arrangement, and by their epithecate wall. It may, in fact, be
asserted that the so-called " rugose " characteristics of the greater part of the
                                                     --;

ralteozoic coral-fauna had liardly left their hold upon Madreporarian life at

the time when the Lower Liassic strata were deposited. No Palajozoic genus

is represented in the Lias. The facies of the Lower Liassic Coral-fauna is
produced by the multitude of branching Thecosmilice, stunted Montlivaltice,
and small-caliced Astrocoenice.

    It is remarkable that neither Tabulate nor Perforate genera have been
found in the Lias. The Tabulata must have been in existence during the
Lias, for they are so fully represented in Pateozoic as well as in Cainozoic

reefs.

                      Corals from the Zone 0/ Ammonites planorbis.

   There are some small Thecosniilice in the so-called Guinea beds at Biuton
and Wilmeote, which are doubtless the descendants of the Thecosmilice of the
White Lias. One species passes up into the zone of Ammonites angulatus
(T. Terquemi, Dune).

  A very remarkable species of Isasfrcea is found in No. 3 bed of the Street

section, associated with Septastr(ea Haimei, Wright.
    This Isastrcea, found so low in the secondary rocks, is especially interesting,

on account of its possessing LatimaBandraean characters, as well as true cali-
cular gemmation close to the margin of the non-Latimteandraean calices.

   Were certain portions of the corallum separated from others, two distinct
genera would be made from them, according to the established rules of clas-
sification. The long serial calices without calicular buds are clearly Lati-
mcfundrcean, and they grow in length by the gradual production of small

septa amongst the others without a cycHcal arrangement. In the non-serial
calices the cyclical arrangement of the septa is not by any means perfect
and these calices differ from the non-serial cahces of the Latimceandrceoi of
the Inferior Oolite by their calicidar gemmation.

   Modern research into the relation between the hard and soft parts of recent
corals has proved that the tentacular and oral structures of serial calices differ
greatly from those which increase by a more or less cyclical arrangement of
the septa. Moreover, the Isastrtean under consideration is rather an abnor-
mal form, from the size of the septal dentations, and the great development of
the endothecal dissepiments. These last close in the bottom of the calices,
stretching across the fossa after the manner of tabulae.

   The earliest known Isastrcra' are from the Triassic beds, and /. Haueri,
Laube, from St. Cassian, is certainlj' like the species now under examination

Latimseandra?an in some respects. These species are synthetic, and point out
the origin of the Latimo'andrcece, which in later times became prominent
members of the Jiu'assic coral-faimse.

    It must be remembered that St.-Cassian species of Thecosmilia and other
genera have been found in the beds higher in the geological scale than the
No. 3 bed (Street section), and also that Isastrcea', perfect in their generic
attributes, have been described from the St.-Cassian limestone. I have named
the new form Isastrcea latimceandroidea.

    Septastrcea Haimei, Wright, sp., is found with the last species. It has
fissiparous calices, no definite cyclical arrangement of its septa, and a strongly

developed endotheca. Its alliance to Septastrcfa excavata, De Prom., is evi-

dent ; but this last species has a definite hexameral arrangement of its cycles,
as well as frequent fissiparity.

    Fissiparity is produced by two large septa stretching across the calicular
fossa, joining and then developing small septa from their sides. The large
septa form the walls which separate the newly formed calices.
ON THE BRITISH FOSSIL CORALS.  103

   This is the earliest species of the genus which has been found in this
country ; but Septastraa Fromenteli, Terquem et Piette, which belongs to the
zone of A. planorbis of the west, has been found in the zone of A. angulatus

in the east of England. It may have flourished in the zone of A. planorbis

in the west, and evidently existed contemporaneously with Septastraa Haimei.

These are the earliest forms of the genus, which has many Isastraean charac-

ters, which has its corallite walls rather imperfectly united, and which is re-
produced by ova and by fissiparity. It is evidently related to a genus of St.-
Cassian corals which, although not found in the zone of Ammonites planorbis
in this country, is represented by two sijecies (one a St.-Cassian type) in the
zone of Ammonites angulatus, in Glamorganshire. The genus is Elysastrcea,
Laube, which wiU be noticed presently.

    Septastrtea'. are not found in Great Britain later than the Lias ; but species
occvu' in the French Oolites and in the Miocene. The genus is extinct.

   It was always an assemblage of variable forms, and the irregiilar septal
arrangement of the species was the rule. This wiU be observed from the

study of the following Table.

to have been consecutive were really synchronous, and that the lifetime of
the St.-Cassian, Azzarola, Avicula-contorta, and Lower-Lias faunae was em-

the greatest importance to the palaeontologist that every objection to the arbi-
trary classification of systematists in geology should be fully stated ; and it is
very evident that the physical breaks in the Upper Trias, Rhsetic, and Lower
Liassic strata are not accompanied by such decided palaeontological changes

as might be beheved to have taken place.

                  Corals from the Zone 0/ Ammonites angulatus, Schl.

   There are some highly fossiUferous beds in South Wales, the West of Eng-
land, the county of Lincoln, and in the North of Ireland which hare the
homotaxis of the typical strata of the continental zone of Ammonites angu-
latus, viz. the Calcaire de Yalogne, the Foie de Veau in the Cote d'Or, and
the Gres Calcareux in the Duchy of Luxembourg. The strata whence the
ablest French palaeontologists of the present day derived the magnificent
Lower-Liassic (Infrahassic of some) moUuscan fauna are the evident equi-
valents biologicalh', and perhaps chronologically of the Sutton stone, the
conglomeratic deposits at Brocastle, the coralUferous bed at Cowbridge (all
being in Glamorganshire, and known so thoroughly, thanks to Charles Moore),
the beds above the White Lias at Marton in Lincolnshire, and some deposits
at Waterloo, Larne, in the North of Ireland.

   The British and continental deposits contain large numbers of molluscan
species in common, and not a few Madreporaria"; but the British strata were

soon proved to be veiy coraUiferous, especially in the west.
   The following is a list of the species of corals from the continental zone

of Ammonites angulatus.

   Probably some of the species of Montlivaltia will have to be absorbed by
others ; but this Ust, when added to the Table of British Corals from the zone
of Ammonites angulntus, proves that, instead of the Lias being an uncoralU-
ferous series, it was quite the contrary. The great development of coral Hfe

western European Avicula-contorta zones, and in the 'VMiite Lias and in the

Ammonites angnlatus in the westernmost Lower Lias are most significant
facts ; and the significance is not diminished when the paucity of tlie species
of the zone of Ammonites Buckhndi, and their distinctness from those of

same manner as the fish which are found in the Triassic strata and also in
the French zone of Ammonites angulatus. Not only are these species of
Madreporaria not rare, but they are accompanied in the Siitton stone by
closely allied species, which of course are allied to the St.-Cassian types.

    Thecosmilia Siittonensis, Duncan, and T. serialis, Duncan, are in structure
and in their methods of reproduction similar to Thecosmilia rugosa, Laube, a
St.-Cassian species. Eh/sastrcea Fischeri, Laube, is accompanied by a closely
allied species in the Glamorganshire beds ; and the genus is remarkable for its
obvious connexion with the early secondary Astrceidce with more or less
united walls.

    KlmhdopliyJlia is a genus closely allied to Thecosmilia, and as tli'' forms
included in these genera commence as simple corals, and become compound
or serial during growth, it is obviously necessary to compare them in their

young stage with the genus MontlivaJtia. Thus MM. Milne-Edwards and

JulesHaime say thatThecosmiliie are compound Monti ivaltice; and this opinion
is rendered important when it is remembered that some- Montlivaltice have
calycinal gemmation, and thus approach the Thecosmilian type still more.
MontlivaJtia is a genus with species in the lowest corallifcrous secondary
rocks ; so that there is a fair assumption to be made that from MontlivaJtia de-
scended ThecosmiJia and RhahdophyJJia. The Thecosmilice of the Sutton stone
are principally capitate forms ; that is to say, they spring from a peduncle
and divide suddenly (by gemmation or by fissiparity). Amongst the non-
capitate forms is ThecosmiJia rugosa ; moreover one of the species common in
the French zone of Ammonites angidatus is also fissiparous and non-capitate,
viz. MicheJini, Terq. et Piette. ThecosmiJia Sidtonensis, Duncan, has some

resemblance to ThecosmiJia rttgosa, Laube, in its calice, but not in its fissi-
parity, and it is allied to ThecosmiJia sericdis, Duncan, in its short peduncle

and capitate swelling. The origin of the corallites in T. Sidtonensis by in-
tercalycinal gemmation is very distinctive.

    ThecosmiJia scriaJis, Duncan, belongs to the stunted ThecosmiJicB so cha-
racteristic of the Triassic and Lower Liassic coralliferous strata. It is
readily distinguished by the number of corallites springing from the pedun-
cle, and by its long serial calices mixed with rounded ones.

   The existence of corallites produced, in one individual, by lateral gemma-

tion, calicinal gemmation, and fissiparity is as remarkable as is the restriction
of other individuals of different species to one of these forms of reproduc-

tion.

    It is necessary to bear in mind that there are these diverse methods of
gemmation and increase in these early ThecosmiJice, because the genera
which are structurally allied, and doubtless genetically related, possess one
or more of these methods.

    Moreover it is remarkable that the feeble true wall, the strong epithecate
wall, the strong endotheca, the irregular septal arrangement, and the absence
of true costse should have existed in these old secondary forms, linking them
on to the Palteozoic Coral-fauna in these particulars, whilst in OoHtic times
the wall, costae, and septa became developed according to the Mesozoic type.
The gradation of structure between the species of the genus in consecutive
periods, however, is very palpable.

    ThecosmiJia Martini and MicheJini belong to the second series* ; they are
closely allied to each other and to several British species ; they are bush-

The genus Elysastro'a has its corallites separate and covered with an

epitheca below, but united above at the calicular margin. The calicular ]iart

is clearly Isastraean, and the basal is Thecosmilian. Now bush-shaped The-

cosmilice, such as T. Michelini and T. Martini, are noticed to become united by

their walls in some individuals, and the w;ills of some species of genera

closely allied to Isaatrcea are not united inferioily.

The genus is clearly a transition, not only between Thecosmilla and

Isastnm, but between several groups of genera. For instance,

The third has evident affinities, from the structure of the wall, with Ehj-

sastrcea and Lepidopliyllia, and it is an unusual form.

The fourth resembles more or less /. Bernardiana, Ch. and Dew. Inf.

Oolite.

    It will be observed that these species have only a remote, but of course

generic, affinity with the IsastracK of the succeeding arenaceous deposits of
the zone of Ammonites BucMandi, but that their affinities with the species
of the St.-Cassian and Inferior-Oolite coral-faunae are decided.

   They have only a generic relation to Isastrmi latimcfandroidea, Duncan, of
the zone of Ammonites planorbis, as no serial calices are found in them.

                                                                                      t2

There is a species oi Latimceandrcea in the British zone o{ Ammonites angulatus,

L.  clenticulata, Duncan                                                                                  its calices are very like the serial calices of Isastrau

   I have already noticed that probably Astrocosnia gibhosa, nobis, is reallj'

a form from Azzarola, for the casts of both are very alike. Now there is an

Astroccenian in the St.-Cassian, A. OppeJi, Laiibe ; it is unfortunately hardly

specifically differentiated, but it is evidently closely allied to the Astrocoenia
of the Sutton stone, as well as to A. Sinemuriensis, D'Orb., sp., from the

French zone of Ammonites ane/ulatus. This last species is also hardly suffi-

ciently differentiated ; but I have placed it amongst the British species

provisionally.

   There are eleven species o{ Astroccenia special to the Welsh Lias, and the
species just noticed. The genus was evidently flourishing in the St.-Cassian
and Azzarolan times, and was singularly abundant in species amongst the

Lower Liassic reefs at Sutton and Brocastle, to which the Mountain Limestone

formed the support.

    The Liassic Astrocoenice occur as large and massive, small and dendroid, or

as irregular and, sometimes, as iuerusting foi-ms. All the species are very

irregular in their septal arrangements, and none of them present definite and

clear cycles of septa.

    Some of the species have the coenenchyma between the calices irregularly

ridged, so as to present the first traces of that coenenehymal development
which characterizes the genus Sti/Ioccenia. The columella is very distinct in
all the species, and the junction of the largest septa to it is marked in some
forms by a paliform swelling ; but there are no paH. The dentate condition of
the septal edge is very marked. The size of the corallum, its shape and habit,
the size of the calices. the character of the costae, and the density, thickness,

and ornamentation of the free portion of it appear to difter in various forms,

and separate eleven new species from those already described.
   The following is a scheme of the Astroccenice from the zone of Ammonites

anyidatus, at Sutton and Brocastle.

   Astrocoema clavellata, Terq. et Piette, is found in the Luxembourg Lower
Lias, but the zoues above that of Ammonites anr/ulatus in the Lias do not
present, as yet, any species. The species is represented in the Oolites, and
became extinct in the Falunian.

   Ci/athocania is a new genus, which I have suggested and published in

order to admit forms which, had they been furni.shedwith a columella, would
have been classified as Astroc^xnicr. There is a species in the zone of Amtno-
nites Biicklandi. Some of the species are mimetic of the Astroccenice. The
following is a scheme of the genus.

The gradation of structure in the genera just passed under our notice

becomes more and more evident as such forms as those included under the

genus Cyatlioccenia are studied. In the early stage Thecosmilia cannot be

distinguished        from Montlivaltia                                                                                    but     gemmation                        from  the  calice,  from     the

calicular waU, or from the wall ensued, or fissiparous division occurred, as

the corals grew. There was an evident tendency in Montlivaltia WaUice,

Duncan, for instance, to reproduce by caUcular gemmation; but in Opjieli-

smilia distinct calicular budding occurred. Under these circumstances the

genetic relations of the three genera Thecosmilia, Montlivaltia, and Oppeli-

smilia are of the closest.

Now in bush-shaped Thecosmilice union often occurs between a bud from
Athe wall and the parent stem.
                                                                                                                          section transverse to the line of growth

(3) pcculiarizes Isastrcea.

   The origin of Latimceanclrcea from Isastrcea has already been noticed. In
Elysastrcm the epitheca and one wall become absorbed at the calicular
margin. In Cyatlioccenia the epitheca between the walls becomes ccenen-
chymal, and variously ornamented ; whilst in Astroccenia the same thing occurs
besides the growth of a columella.

   The following grouping of the genera is made with a view to assert that
they had genetic relations with Montlivaltia, and that some Cainozoic types
revert to more ancient.

smilia and Solenastraa.

   The Monilivaltice of the zone of Ammonites angulatus are remarkable for
their septal regularity, the amount of disscpimental endotheca, the usiially
rudimentar)' couditiou of the true wall, and the development of the strong and
compensating endotheca. These characteristics are observed in the St.-Cassian
Montlivaltiw, and in those which are found in the strata intervening between
the Ammonites-caujuhttns and the St.-Cassian beds. These structural pecu-
liarities, in a genus whose later Jura.ssic species have a perfect hcxameral
arrangement, a perfect wall, and moderate endotheca and epitheca, indicate
the descent of the MontUvalthv fi'om a Palaeozoic stock. lu MoiitHvaltla
Mufchhoni, Duncan, the wall and epitheca are united perfectly into one
structure with the intercostal spaces, just as the septa of some simple Palaeozoic
corals are continuous, not with costaj, but with the intercostal spaces or

their analogues.

   M. parasitica is remarkable for its septal number ; and M. simplex has

distant and curved septa.

   M. papHlata, Duncan, M. Hibernice, Duncan, and 31. Haimei, Chap, et

Dew., are closely allied species ; they are broad-based, pedunculate, short,
and turbinate, and vary greatly. The last-named species ranges probably
over the whole area of the zone of Ammonites angulatus.

   Closely allied to Montlivaltia and Tliecosmilia is the new genus Oppeli-

smilia. Its Palaeozoic aspect is distinct, the multiseptal and non-cychcal
calice, the calicular budding, and the strong epitheca all refer it to bygone

types.

    These corals, from the Lias beneath the zone where Gryphcea incurva and
Ammonites BucMandi are abundant, indicate that, like the succeeding forma-
tions of the Chalk and the Oolite, the Lias was very coralliferous. Nothing
marks the progress of pateontology more strongly than the ability of making
this statement from well-ascertained data ; for within a very few years the
Lias was considered so mitddy a deposit as to be obnoxious to coral life.

    Now, with a great fauna, part of it indicating reef conditions and the rest
moderately deep water, the Lower Lias will assume as great an importance
to the zoophytologist as the Eocene. The Liassic coral-faima reflects the
Pala?ozoic as the Eocene foreshadows theEecent coral-fauna. Unfortunately

the paucity of our information respecting the earliest Secondary coral-fauna,

that of the Lower Trias, is so great that the Liassic species are still greatly
removed from the original types.

Corals are not numerous as regards their species in this zone, and the com-

monest species of tlie zone of Ammonites angulatus have not been found in
any of its strata.

   It is probable that Thecosmilia Martini, E. de Prona., which in France
ranges from the beds containing Ammonites Moreanus into those in which
Ammonites bisidcatus is found, has a corresponding vertical range in England.

Thecosmilia Jlirhelini, Terq. et Piette, appears to be present in the zone of
Ammonites bistdcatt(^ ; but as yet only casts of its specimens, which resemble

those of the species from Abbot's Wood in the zone of Ammonites angulatus,

have been found. These casts, and some of Thecosmilia Martini, have been
assigned to the genus Chulophyllia, but without svifhcient reason. Thecosmilia
is a large genus, and of course the species present individuals of aU sizes ; so

that to give to small cylindroid Th cosmilice the generic appellation of

Cladojihi/llia is unreasonable. In fact this last genus is but a subgenus of
Thecosmilia at the best.

List of Species from this Zone.

1. MontliTolUa. Gaettardi, Blavivilie.  6. Isastrsba, insignia, Buncav.
2. Septastrrea Eveshami, Diniean.       6. Stricklandi. Duncan.
3. Lepidophyllia Stricklandi, Duncan.   7. Cyathocoenia globosa, Duncan.
4. Isastraea endothecata, Duncan.

   Septastrcea Eveshami has very irregular calices ; and when the wall has
been worn away between them, a groove is seen indicating that separation of
the corallites which I have already noticed to obtain in the Elysastrcpce. The

species is rather abnormal ; for although fissiparity is common, still there is

a disposition to serial increase.

    The genus Isasfrca has three well-marked species in this zone, and they
are very distinct from those of the zone of Ammonites angulatus. In Isastrcea

endothecata the depth of the calices, the extraordinary development of the

endotheca, and the great number and the irregularity of the septa are differ-

ential. Isastrcea Stricllandi also has a great development of endotheca ; for

large plates of it cross the coraUites, and shut in the calicular fossae below,

acting perfectly like tabulae, just as in Cyathaphora. The septa are few in
number ; and no cyclical arrangement is to be noticed.

    Isastrcea insignis belongs to a section of the genus which comprises /.

Henocquei, Ed. & H., from the Hettangian, I. pohjgonalis, Muschelkalk, and

&/. Lonsdalci, Ed. H., from the Inferior Oolite.

  A new genus, Lepidophyllia, has a species in this zone, and a very fine one

in the zone of Ammonites Jamesoni: it is an interesting form, and presents
some Eugose characteristics, such as a repeated calicular gemmation and an
epithecate waU.

   The only Montlivcdtia I have seen from the zone of Ammonites Bucklandi
has a lower horizon on the continent. Having thus a very considerable
vertical and geographical range, the species is, of course, very variable, and
many local varieties have been found, which are separated with difficulty from
Montlivcdtia Uaimei. These flat multiseptate MontlivcdtiiP are very charac-

teristic of the Lower Lias. They have a representative in the zone of Ammo-

nites obtusus, in the form of M. patula, Duncan, whose dentate septa are
wonderful. Such septa began then to be the fashion ; for in the next zone
the Montlivaltice are famous for their grandly ornamented dentations.

corals ; and it is necessary to assert this in collecting under one fossil species

corals of very different external forms. The Monilivaltue from the zone of

Ammonites rcwicostatus are common, and their mineral condition has been

preservative of the minutest details : even the granulations on the minute

septal dentations are preserved.

Dr. Wright collected and described a very remarkable series of corals from

the Hippopodium and coral-beds of Marie Hill, Cheltenham, Honeybourne,

and Fenny Compton, naming them TJiecoct/afhus rur/osus. The assemblage

of forms thus named contains very varied specimens, the external shape

Aespecially being rarely alike in two or three instances.  careful examination

of sections of most of the forms enabled me to place them all in the genus

Montlivaltia. The absence of pali and the presence of short endothecal

dissepiments proved that they could not belong to the genus Thecocyathvs.

But the general Montlivaltian characteristics have also the palaeozoic peculi-

arities already noticed in considering the Montlivaltice of the zone of Ammo-

nites angulatus. Montlivaltia riigosd, Wright, sp., will therefore take the

place of Thecocyatlms rugosns, Wright, MS.

Montlivaltia mucronata, Duncan, is a polymorphic species, remarkable for

its elegance and ornamentation ; some of its specimens are amongst the most

beautiful of the Madreporaria. The study of a large collection enabled

me to place some very different-looking forms in the same species, the inter-
mediate varieties having been in my possession.

   There is a decided affinity between these Montlivaltice and M. Stuchburyi,

Ed. & H., of the Inferior Oolite. Moreover the 31. nummiformis, Duncan,

&of this zone is related, if structural affinity be of value, to M. lens, E. H.,

Inf. Oolite. Montlivaltia radiata, Duncan, is a very abnormal species, and

retains the quadrate septal arrangement, which is fully represented in many

Liassic species, but which is so characteristic of many Palseozoic forms. It

must be remembered that such strange structural peculiarities in later forms

may arise from atavism.

   There are then twelve species in the Lower Lias above the zone of Amvio-
nites angidatus, five of which are above the zone of Ammonites Buchlandi.
It needs no care to decide that the fauna of the zone of Ammonites angu-
latus has little affinity with that of the other zones.

                                   Corals from the Middle Lias.

    1. Lepidophyllia Hehridensis, Duncan.
    2. Montlivaltia Victonce, Duncan.
   The first species is from the island of Pabba, and was collected by Dr.
Wright ; it forms a bed there, and was doubtless a rapid grower.
   The genus has already been slightly noticed ; its calicular gemmation and

the growth of epitheca on the free waU of the corallites, where they grow

higher than their neighbours, refer to an Elysastraean, Thecosmilian, and

Septastraean series.

  A great number of specimens of all sizes of a very polymorphic Montlivaltia

have been found on the sui-face of the fields at Chemington, near Skipton, and
in a watercourse or ditch section of the Middle Lias close by. Ammonites

Henleyi, A. Cliiltensis, Cardinia attenuata, and C. elonrjata were found with

the corals.

   MontUvaltia Vktorice, Duncan. This coral grows to a height of five inches,

and may be two inches broad ; it is the largest simple secondary form, and
has the epithecal waU so pccuhar to the Liassic Montlwaltke. Its septal
number is very great, and the endotheca is highly developed. It is very

variable in shape.

   There are some fragmentary corals in the Marlstone, but their genera are
doubtful ; and the cast of a MontUvaltia was found by Mr. Charles Moore at
Wells, but I cannot determine the species.

Report of a Committee appointed to investigate Animal Substances

           with the Spectroscope. By E. Ray Lankester.

DuEiKG the year attempts have been made to obtain a supply of Sipho-

nostoma or Sahdlce for the purpose of investigating the derivatives of the

body described by me last year as chlorocruorine ; at present a sufficient

supply has not been obtained. The absorption-spectrum of chlorocruorine

from Sahella, however, has been carefully observed and recorded. The

Sponge-chlorophyll has been investigated with the object of determining

which of the two green and two yellow bodies, spoken of by Professor Stokes

as being present in plants, is present in the sponge ; and some interesting

results appear likely to be obtained when the history of plant-chlorophyll is
more fully known.

The feathers of twenty-two species of birds, mostly red, green, or blue, have

been examined for absorption-spectra; none was obtained; but Prof. Church

has discovered a red matter containing cojiper in the feathers of the Turacou

and to this body he gives the name turacin. The spectrum of this substance

I have carefully examined and recorded. As stated by Prof. Church, it gives
two absorption-bands, when in the feather, close to those of haemoglobin, but
readUy separable from them, and by no means indicating anything like

identity in the bodies, as Prof. Church appears to have thought.

Anotes of many by this means, which is very useful.            more satisfactory

means of measurement than Sorby's scale appears to be required, since the

now to be deferred.

Second Report of the Committee on the Condensation and Analysis of
                             Tables of Steamship Performance.

At the Dundee meeting of the British Association in 1867, the Committee

on the above-mentioned subject, consisting of John Scott Russell,Esq., P.ll.S.,
William Faii-bairn, Esq., LL.D., Thomas Hawksley, Esq., C.E., James 11.

Napier, Esq., F.ll.S., and W. J. Macquorn Eankine, Esq., LL.D., was reap-

pointed, for the purpose of continuing its duties as defined in the resolution

by which it was originally appointed in 1866 ; and a sum of i^lOO was j^laced
at its disposal. The Committee, as before, employed Mr. J. Quant, naval
architect, as calculator, and have reason to be highly satisfied with the

manner in which his duties have been performed.
   The sum of .£100 has been expended.

   The contents of the Eeport now submitted to the Association arc as

follows :

   List of detailed tables whose condensed results appear in the present

Eeport.

Condensed tables.

Analyzed tables, according to the method of Mr. Scott Eussell.

Analyzed tables, according to the method of Professor Eankine, so far as

that method is at present complete ; that is to say, taking into account eddy-
resistance depending on friction, and wave-resistance due to shortness of

afterbody. Just at the commencement of the Meeting to which this Eeport

is presented, Professor Eankine pointed out a hitherto neglected kind of wave-

resistance,  depending  on  a relation  between  speed  and  depth  of  immersion
                                                                                                                       ;

but the data of observation necessary in order to determine its amoimt and

laws have not yet been obtained.
    In explanation of the distinction between " condensed " and " analyzed "

tables, it has to be stated that the condensed tables contain nothing except

quantities ascertained by measurement, observation, and experiment ; while

the analyzed tables contain certain functions of those quantities, which

functions are connected with theoretical views as to the probable nature and

laws of the actions that take place between the vessel and the water.

List of Detailed Tables wJiose condensed results appear in this Report.

   The detailed tables whose condensed results appear in the present Eeport
consist of those which were published in the Eeport of the British Associa-

tion, 1863.                                             Steam  Packet Company's

  --Table III. Eoyal (West-India) Mail Packet Companj, Southampton to

St. Thomas, distance 3622 miles, from July 2nd, 1862, to June 2nd, 1863.

    This Table contains the perfoi-mance of five ships, the 'Atrato,' the 'Shannon,'

tke 'Seine,' the ' Tasmanian,' and 'La Plata.' No draft of water is given, but the

condition of the hull is stated.

 --Table IV. Eoyal (West-India) Mail Packet Company, St. Thomas to

Southampton, July 30th, 1862, to June 30th 1863.

    This Table contains the same steamers as the preceding. Table III. contains
the performance of those ships on their outward voyage, and Table IV. their per-

formance on their homeward voyage, during twelve months' work. No draft of
water on leaving port, nor area of midship section has been given, although mean

displacement has been stated.

 --Table V. Eoyal (West-India) Mail Packet Company. Summary made

from the Tables of diagrams from indicator and working of the engines be-

longing to the various ships included in the return furnished of the perfor-

mances from St. Thomas to Southampton, between July 30, 1862, and June

30, 1863, as given in Table IV.

   This Table contains very useful data ; the quantities of two ships have been reset
and repeated in this condensed Report, and as far as possible the lines of the
ships have been obtained, and the draft of water and area of midship section
corresponding to the mean displacement are inserted in the condensed Tables.

   Tables VI., VII., VIII., and IX. contain abstracts of engineer's log of the
* Great Eastern.'

   The indicated horse-power has been given in Table IX. only ; and therefore that

performance only is available for calculation.

 --Table X. Abstract of engineer's log of the Steamship ' Great Eastern,'

eighteen voyages, 1860-1863.

No statement has been made of indicated horse-power.

XL --Table  Eeturn of H.M. Steam Line-of-Battle Ship ' Victor Emmanuel.'

   This Table contains twenty-seven runs, of which sixteen were made under steam.
Quantities of the vessel have already been given in last year's condensed Report,
Table V. Her performance appears in this Report under diti'erent conditions of
draft of water and displacement, and consumption of coals.

    This Table has been condensed to eleven runs under different conditions ; and,

although not strictly according to the form laid down in last year's Report for the

condensation of tables, it bas been thought proper to insert tbe whole of the items
given in the Report of 18fi.3, so as to form a Table by itself. The indicated borse-
power as given in the condensed Table has been calculated from the indicator-dia-
grnms as published in the Report of 1863. This is the only one of the condensed

Tables in which the degree of expansion of steam has been given. It is much to

be desired that the lines of this vessel, as also those of other ships of war, should
be obtained from the Admiralty, in order to furnish data for analysis.

116 REPORT 1868.

 --Table A. Particulars of the trial trips of four Holyhead MaU Steamers

' Banshee,' ' Llewellyn,' ' Leinster,' and ' Connaught,' in comparison with
H.M.S. paddle-yacht ' Victoria and Albert.'

   This Table does not mention the displacement of the ships. Where it has been

possible these quantities have been tilled up from the lines and from other sources

of information.

    Eeport 1863 contains two Plates showing indicator-diagrams of H.M.S.

' Yictor Emmanuel ' (fore-cylinder and aft-cjlinder).

   The pressure of steam in the cj'linders, and the indicated horse-power as cal-
culated by these diagrams, are given in Table IX. of this Report.

    Of the five Poyal (West-India) Mail Packet Company's Steamships
whose performances were published in Tables III., IV., and V., Eeport 1863,
the performances of two have been condensed and inserted in this Report,
viz. the ' Atrato ' (paddle) , built by Messrs. Laird and Co., and the ' Tas-
manian ' (screw), by Messrs. Laurence HUl and Co.

    The nominal horse-power of the screw-stcaraer 'Tasmanian' is given as
744 in Eeport of 1863, and 550 in earlier printed Tables. In earlier Tables
the nominal power of the ' Atrato ' is given as 800, whereas in the Eeport of
1863 it has been published as 766. Further, it appears that the indicated
horse-power, as given in the condensed Eeport of 1867, is the I. H. P. as
measured in 07ie cylinder only, in the case of the paddle-steamers ' Atrato,'
' Shannon,' and ' La Plata.'

   From " Particulars of Trial Trips, Table A," Eeport 1863, in which the

performance is given of the four vessels on the Mail Service between Dublin
and Holyhead with a voyage on the same route of the ' Victoria and Albert,'
                                           ',

       ON STEAMSHIP PERFORMANCE.                       iir

only the performance of the 'Leinster' and Her Majesty's yacht has been

extracted and given in this Report.
    In studying the quantities of these mail-boats, it was found that in Report

1861, Table IX., the nominal power of ' Leinster' is given as 750, whilst in
Report 1863 it is printed as 720. Again, in Report 1861 the diameter of
the wheel is given as 33 feet outside the floats, and 29 feet to centre of
journals, whilst in Report 1863 the diameter is given as 31 feet outside

--floats, and 27 feet to centre of journals a difference therefore of 2 feet in

each case. Purther, in Report 1861 the quantities of the 'Leinster' and
' Ulster ' are given under one bracket, leading to suppose that those two
ships are alike in all respects, whereas such is not the case. The diameter
of cylinders of both ships is given in that Report as 96 inches with a stroke
of 7 feet, whilst in the Report of 1863 the diameter of cylinder of the ' Lein-
ster' is printed as 98 inches, with 6 feet 6 inches stroke, and that of the 'Ulster'

as 96 inches, with 7 feet stroke.
    In oi'der therefore to ascertain the truth it was necessary to write to the

manufacturer of the engines ; and the correct quantities of the ' Leinster

are given in the Table below.

   In making the condensed Report of last year, the Ptcport on Steamship Per-
formance of 1863 was not in the calculator's hands, and the quantities of
the ' Leinster,' therefore, were given as he found them in former Reports ; but

by a comparison with the Table^below the errors may be corrected. The dis-

placement, as here given, and which was not mentioned in Report 1863, has

been calculated from the lines.

  --Coefficient of diminished resistance. This coefficient belongs to a pure-

mathematical wave-line bow. The question offers itself, what is the
length of this bow ?

   The length of the bow of the ship can be denoted

1. By the speed,
2. By the place of half the beam in the light water-line,
                                              --

                    ON STEAMSHIP PERFORMANCE.                       121

3. By the coefficient of fineness of ends, and
4. By the actual length as found by the Knes.

   For the afterbody the length would be f of the above quantities, with the
exception of 4, where it is given by the lines. 1 , 2, 3, 4 worked out for the

* Atrato ' would give a length of bow as computed by

                    1. 70-16 feet*

                    2. 80

                    3. 176

                    4. 166  ,,

quantities which differ immensely. But whatever the length of forebody,

afterbody, and middlebody may be as computed above, the three together

must form the given displacement with the given draught of water. The
wave-line method supplies formulse by means of which the exact length of
bow answei-ing both conditions may be found ; and in order to prove which of
the four quantities is correct we proceed as foUows :

Let^ denote the coefficient of fineness of midship section,

       q the coefficient of fineness of body,
       r the coefficient of fineness of ends equal to q -^p ; then

volume of forebody equal to -5 B?c/p =-5 Z x

= +afterbody ,, -5 B?V?p +-19635 B\//j (-5 Z' -19635 B)©
                    Wdp=l" x@
,, middlebody ,,

total displacement  ,, ·5'iildp -{-5Wdp-\--lQQ2>riWdp-\-W,"dp.

Dividing this by the parallelepiped, BLcZ, will give the coefficient of fineness of

body, or q,

             51 +-51' +-19635B-Z"=?L=:rL; but =+l l' 'L-r;

                                                     P

      hence ·5L+-5r + -19635B=)-L,

from which equation I", or the length of the middlebody, may be determined;

and having the length of the middlebody deducted from the total length of
the ship, six-tenths of the remainder will give the length for the- forebody,
and four-tenths of the remainder will give the length of the afterbody.

   Working the above formula out for the ' Atrato ' we shall get

          + =·5 X 336-5 -I- -51" -19635 x 40-92 -6339 x 336-5,
         =·5Z" =37-02, or Z" 74-04 equal to length of middlebody.

=hence length of forebody equal to -6(336-5-- 74-04) 157-476,

 =and length of afterbody ,, ·4(336-5-74-04) 104-984.

   It will be seen from these quantities that already twice as long a bow has

been obtained as is necessary for a speed of 11-22 knots.

   Let us now test these quantities for the displacement.

  A* curve is appended at the end of this Eeport, by which for any given speed in statute

miles the length of bow and stern might be measured.

      + + +1469 979-3 149-9 1381=3979-2 tons, or jnst t-w^o-tenths of a ton more

      than the actual displacement. Now there is no hnigth of forebody, after-

      body, and middlebody possible that ^riU fulfil the conditions required ; and it
      R^ould therefore be wrong to compute the length of forebody in any other

      way than through means of the coefficient of fineness of ends. The ' Atrato

      has no actual middlebody ; but -we see that she really could have had a
      parallel middlebody of 74 feet without in the least injuring her qualities.

         The length of forebody, afterbody, and middlebody, through means of the
      mentioned formula;, have been calculated for several ships, and the result has
      been appended in a Table which follows the Table of Analysis according to

      Mr. Scott Eussell's method.
          It will easily bo seen that this length of middlebody varies with the draft

      of water ; the lighter the vessel is, the shorter the middlebody, and the

      deeper the vessel the longer the middlebody, the different coefficients of fine-

      ness necessarily becoming smaller when light, and larger when laden.
         The coefiicieut of diminished resistance is therefore (40-92 ^157-476)^

      =0-0675.
         Eesistanee due to ship's way, equal to area of midship section multiplied

      by the square of the speed of the ship in feet per second ; and this product
      multiphed by the coefficient of diminished resistance gives 15850 pounds' re-

      sistance due to ship's way.

      Girth at midship section in feet                  62-80

          This item, -when the lines are in hand, is not immediately necessary, al-

      though, when such is the case, that girth must be measured, in order to lay
      down the surface of the skin ; but iu the absence of the lines of the vessel

      the girth at the midship section becomes a great function of the siu'face of
      the skin. The 66 feet, as above, has been actually measured from the

      body-plan; but where a certain proportion exists between the beam and
      the draft of water, the girth may be found to a close approximation by
      multiplying the beam plus twice the draft with a certain coefficient, which
      coefficient may be found from a Table at the end of this Eeport, in which the

      girths at the midship section have all been found from the hues of the ship.
          ON STEAMSHIP PERFORMANCE.                                    123

In the case of the ' Atrato,' where the proportion between breadth and draft
is as i : -448, the coefRcient would be like H.M.S. ' Warrior ' and ' Achilles,'
or the mean between the two would give -8 ; and this multiplied by 40-92

+ =2 X 18-35 62-09, or -71 feet shorter than is actually the case. The cause

of this is that the ' Warrior ' and ' AchiUes ' both have more rise of floor than

the ' Atrato,' and this rise of floor may be judged from the coefficient of fine-

ness of midship section ; therefore, by using a little caution in the use of this

Table, the girth at the midship section may be found to a very close ap-

proximation.

Surface of skin in square feet                                  17233

   This surface has been exactly measured from the lines of the ship ; and

where this has not been possible, the coefficient of -77 may be judiciously

used from a comparison with other ships, of which the surface of skin has
been laid down and calculated, and given at the end of this Report.

   Resistance due to skin equal to the surface of the skin mul tiplied by the
square of the speed of the ship, in knots, and the product divided by 100,
supposing that the skin of the ship is clean and smooth, or

                     = 27300 pounds skin resistance.

1, L, length on load water-line, in feet                336"5

2. G, mean immersed girth, in feet, as calculated       52

           from the girths at twenty-five equidistant
           cross-sections by Simpson's multipliers . .

The girths are measured for the purpose of calculating an integral, viz.

JG'c^a:, where G' is any girth, and dx an element of the length ; the use of

Simpson's multipliers gives a more accurate value of the true mean girth,
than is given by merely adding together the girths and dividing by their
number. In practice, however, where the cross-sections are very numerous,
there is scarcely any difference between the ordinary arithmetical mean
and the mean as found by Simpson's multipliers. Where there are few

cross-sections, the use of Simpson's multipliers becomes necessary.

3. 0, area of immersed midship section, in square feet  653.

   4. m, ratio in which virtual length of afterbody is less than least proper
length for speed by the wave theory.

   5. m', ratio in which virtual length of forebody is less than length of soli-
tary wave for speed by the wave theory.

   The virtual lengths here referred to are those deduced from the displace-
ment and dimensions by Mr. Scott RusseU's method ; that is to say, the
lengths of wave-line afterbody and forebody, which would give the same

displacement.

   These two quantities are to be calculated only when less than 1 ; for
when equal to or greater than 1, they have no influence on the results.

afterbody at their points of inflexion                  '0611.

A" V.  factor called the coefficient of friction, depending on the material

with which the ship's skin is coated, and its condition as to roughness or

smoothness.

   " The sum of the products of the factors I. and II, for the whole skin of the

ship is called her augmented surface ; and the eddy-resistance of the whole

ship may therefore be expressed as the product of the augumented surface by

the factors III., IV., and V., above mentioned."

   The " coefficient of propulsion " may be defined as the nimiber of square

feet of augmented surface which are driven at one knot by one indicated

horse-power.

 On the Results of Spectrum Analysis as applied to the Heavenly Bodies;                        I

    a Discourse delivered before the British Association at Nottingham,

   on August 24_, 1866. By William Huggins^ F,R,S., Hon. Sec. to

    the Royal Astronomical Society.

                                                                                (Abstract*'.)

                                                     [Plates III. IV.]

The speaker commenced with a few pi-eliminary remarks on the importance
to Astronomy of the analysis of light hy the prism. The researches of

Kirchhoff have placed in the hands of the astronomer a method of analysis
which is specially suitable for the examination of the heavenly bodies. So
unexpected and important are the results of the application of spectrum

analysis to the objects in the heavens, that this method of observation may
be said to have created a new and distinct branch of astronomical science.

   Physical Astronomy, the imperishable and ever-growing monument to the
memory of Newton, may be described as the extension of terrestrial dyna-

mics to the heavens. It seeks to explain the movements of the celestial
bodies on the supposition of the universality of an attractive force similar to
that which exists upon the earth.

   The new branch of astronomical science which spectrum analysis may be

said to have founded, has for its object to extend the la's^'s of terrestrial
l^hysics to the other phenomena of the heavenly bodies, and it rests upon the

now established fact that matter of a nature common to that of the earth,

and subject to laws similar to those which prevail upon the earth, exists
throughout the stellar universe.

   The peculiar importance of Kirchhoff's discovery to astronomy becomes
obvious, if we consider the position in which we stand to the heavenly bodies.
Gravitation and the laws of our being do not permit us to leave the earth, it
is therefore by means of llyht alone that we can obtain any knowledge of the
grand array of worlds which surround us in cosmical sj)ace. The star-lit
heavens is the only chart of the universe we have, and in this luminous
chart each twinkling point is the sign of an immensely vast, though distant

region of activity.

   Hitherto the light from the heavenly bodies, even when collected by the

largest telescopes, has conveyed to us but very meagre information, and in
some cases only of their form, their size, and their colour. The discovery of
Kirchhoff enables us to interpret symbols and indications hidden within the
light itself, which furnish trustworthy information of the chenucal, and also
to some extent of the physical condition of the excessively remote bodies
from which the light has emanated.

   Newton found that when white light is made to pass through a prism of
glass it is decomposed into the beautiful colours which are seen in the rain-
bow. These colours, when they are in this way separated from each other,

form the Spectrum of the light.
   About a century later AVoUaston and Fraunhofer made the discovery that

when the light of the sun is decomposed by a prism, the rainbow colours
which form its spectrum are not continuous, but are interrupted by a large
number of dark lines. These lines of darkness are the symbols which indi-
cate the chemical constitution of the sim. It was not imtil recently, in the
j-ear 1859, that Kirchhoff taught us the true uatiu'e of these lines. He him-

self immediately applied his method of interpretation to the dark lines of the

solar spectrum, and was rewarded by the discovery that several of the che-

mical elements which exist upon the earth, are present in the solar atmo-

sphere.

The speaker stated that it was his intention on this occasion to bring before

the Association the results of the extension of this method of analysis by the

prism to the heavenly bodies other than the sun. These researches have been

carried on in his Observatory during the last four years. In respect of a

large part of these investigations, viz. those of the moon, the planets, and

fixed stars, he has had the great pleasure of working conjointly with the

very distinguished chemist and philosopher Dr. W. Allen Miller, Treas. R.S.

   The speaker then referred to the principles of spectrum analysis upon

which theii- interpretation of the phenomena observed in the spectra of the
heavenly bodies was based, stating that spectra may be arranged under

three orders.

1. The si)ecial character which distinguishes spectra of the Jlrst order con-

sists in that the continuity of the coloured band is unbroken either by dark
Weor bright lines.
                                                                                                learn from such a spectrum that the light has been

emitted by an opake body, and almost certainly by matter in the solid or
Aliquid state.
                                                                                                spectrum of this order gives to us no knowledge of the che-

mical nature of the incandescent body from which light comes.

    2. Spectra of the second order are very different. These consist of coloured

lines of light separated from each other. Prom such a spectrum we may

learn much. It informs us that the luminous matter from which the lifht

has come is in the state of gas. It is only when a luminous body is free

from the molecular trammels of solidity and liquidity that it can exhibit its

own peculiar power of emitting some coloured rays alone. Hence substances
when in a state of gas, may be distinguished from each other by their spectra.
Each element, and every compound body that can become luminous in the

gaseous state without suffering decomposition, is distinguished by a group of

lines peculiar to itself. It is obvious that if the groups of lines character-

izing the different terrestrial substances be known, a comparison of these, as
standard spectra, with the spectrum of light from an unknown source, will
show whether any of these terrestrial substances exist in the source of the

light.

    3. The tJbird order consists of the spectra of incandescent solid or liquid
bodies, in which the continuity of the coloured light is broken by dark Hues.

These dark spaces are not produced by the source of the light. They tell
of vapours through which the light has passed on its way, and which have
robbed the light by absorption of certain definite colours or rates of vibra-

tion ; such spectra are formed by the light of the sun and stars.

   Kirchhoff has shown that if the vapours of terrestrial substances come
between the eye and an incandescent body, they cause groups of dark lines,
and further, that the groi(2J of dark lines produced by each vapour is identi-

cal in number and in position in the spectrum mth the group of bright lines

of which its light consists when the vapour is luminous.

It is evident that Kirchhoff by this discovery furnished us with the
means of interpreting the dark lines of the solar spectrum. Por this pur-

pose it is necessary to compare the bright lines in the spectra of the light of

terrestrial substances when in the state of gas with the dark lines in the
                                                                                                When a group of bright lines coincides with a similar
solar spectrum.

                                                                                             _

group of dark lines, we know that the terrestrial substance producing the

bright lines is present in the atmosphere of the sun. For it is this substance,

and this substance alone, which by its own peculiar power of absorption can

liroduce that particular group of dark lines. In this way Kirchhoff disco-

Tered the presence of several terrestrial elements in the solar atmosphere.

                                    Methods of Observation.

   The speaker then described the special methods of observation by which,
in their investigations, they applied these principles of spectrum analysis to

the light of the heavenly bodies. He stated that several circumstances unite

to make these observations very difficult and very irksome. In our climate,
on few nights only, even of those in which the stars shine brilliantly to the
naked eye, is the air sufficiently steady for these extremely delicate observa-

tions. Further, the light of the stars is feeble. This difficulty has been met,
in some measure, by the employment of a large telescope. The light of a star
falling upon the surface of its object-glass of eight inches aperture is gathered
up and concentrated at the focus into a minute and briUiant point of light.

   Another inconvenience arises from the apparent movement of the stars,
caused by the rotation of the eartli, which carries the astronomer and his
instruments with it. This movement was counteracted by a movement given
by clockwork to the telescope in the opposite direction. In practice, how-
ever, it is not easy to retain the image of a star for any length of time
exactly M^thin the jaws of a slit only the t^-^-^ inch apart. By patient
perseverance these difficulties have been overcome, and satisfactory results
obtained. They considered that the tnistworthiness of their results must
rest chiefly upon direct and simultaneous comparisons of terrestrial spectra
witli those of celestial objects. For this purpose the apparatus which is re-
presented in fig. 1, and fig. 2, Plate III., was contrived.

   By the outer tube c the instrument is adapted to the eye-end of the tele-
scope, and is carried round with it by the clock motion. Within this outer

tube a second tube h slides carrjdng a cylindrical lens, a. This lens is for the
purpose of elongating the round point-like image of the star into a short line

of light, which is made to fall exactly within the jaws of a narrow sUt, d.
Behind the slit, an achromatic lens, r/ (and at the distance of its own focal
length), causes the pencils to emerge parallel. They then pass into two
prisms, h, of dense flint glass. The spectrum which results from the decom-
position of the light by the prisms is viewed through a small achromatic
telescope, 1. This telescope is provided with a micrometer screw, q, by which
the lines of the spectra may be measured.

    The light of the terrestrial substances which are to be compared with the
stellar spectra is admitted into the instrument in the followdng manner :

    Over one half of the slit is fixed a small prism, e, which receives the light
reflected into it by the moveable mirror/' placed above the tube. The mirror
 faces a clamp of ebonite, r, provided with forceps to contain fragments of the
 metals employed. These metals arc rendered luminous in the state of gas
by the intense heat of the sparks from a powerful induction coil. The light
 from the spark reflected into the instrument by means of the mirror and the
 little prism passes on to the prisms in company with that from the star. In
 the small telescope the two spectra are viewed in juxtaposition, so that the
 coincidence and relative positions of the bright lines in the spectrum of the
 spark with dark lines in the spectrum of star can be accurately determined.

                                      Moon and Planets.

     The speaker referred in a few words only to the spectra of the moon and

  planets. These objects, unlike the stars and nebulae, are not orir/incd sources
SPECTRUM ANALYSIS OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES.                            143

of light. Since they shine by reflecting the sim's light, their spectra re-
semble the solar spectrnm, and the only indications in their spectra which

may become sources of knowledge to us are confined to any modifications
which the solar light may have suffered either in the atmospheres of the

planets, or by reflection at their surfaces.

   Moon.--On the moon the results of their observations have been negative.
The spectra of the various parts of the moon's surface, when examined under

different conditions of illumination, showed no indication of an atmosphere
about the moon. The speaker also watched the spectrum of a star, as the

dark edge of the moon advanced towards the star, and then occulted it. No

signs of a lunar atmosphere presented themselves.

  --Jupiter. In the spectrum of Jupiter, lines are seen which indicate the

existence of an absorptive atmosphere about this planet. In fig. 3, Plate III.

these lines are presented as they appeared when viewed simultaneously with

the spectrum of the sky which, at the time of observation reflected the light
of the setting sun. One strong band corresponds with some terrestrial atmo-
spheric lines, and probably indicates the presence of vapours similar to those
which are about the earth. Another band has no counterpai't amongst the
lines of absorption of our atmosphere, and tells vis of some gas or vapour

--which does not exist in the earth's atmosphere.
   Saturn. The spectrum of Saturn is feeble, but lines similar to those
which distinguish the sjjectrum of Jitpiter were detected. These lines are
less strongly marked in the ansse of the rings, and show that the absorjjtive
power of the atmosphere about the rings is less than that of the atmosphere
which surrounds the ball. Janssen has quite recently found that several of
the atmospheric lines are produced by aqueous vapour. It appears to be
very probable that aqueous vapour exists in the atmospheres of Jupiter and

--Saturn.
   Mars. On one occasion some remarkable groups of lines were seen in the
more refrangible part of the spectrum of Mars. These may be connected

--with the red coloiir which distinguishes this planet.
    Venus. Though the spectrum of Venus is brilliant and the lines of
Fraunhofer were well seen, no additional lines affording evidence of an
atmosphere about Venus were detected. The absence of lines may be due
to the circumstance that the light is probably reflected, not from the
planetary surface, but from clouds at some elevation above it. The light
which reaches us in this way by reflection from clouds would not have been
exposed to the absorbent action of the lower and denser strata of the planet's

atmosphere.

The Fixed Stars.

The fixed stars, though immensely more remote, and less conspicuous in

brightness than the moon and planets, yet because they are original sources

of light, furnish us with fuller indications of their nature. The telescope
was appealed to in vain, for in the largest instruments the stars remain

--disldess brilliant points merely.

The stars have, indeed, been represented as suns, each upholding a dependent

family of planets. This opinion rested tfpon a^^ossibh analogy alone. It was

Wenot more than a speculation.  possessed no certain knowledge from

observation of the true nature of those remote points of light. This long and

cai-uestly coveted information is at last furnished bj' spectrum analysis. "We

are now able to read in the light of each star some indications of its nature.

The speaker referred to two bright stars which had been examined with

great care. The spectra of these stars are represented in Plate IV.

   The Tipper one represents tlie spectrum of Aldebaran, and the other that
of Betelgeux, the star marked a in the constellation of Orion.

   The positions of all these dark lines, about eighty in each star, were
determined by careful and repeated measures. These measured lines form

but a small part of the numerous fine hnes which may be seen in the spectra

of these stars.

    Beneath the spectrum of each star are arranged the bright lines of the
metals which have been compared with it. These terrestrial spectra appeared
in the instrument, as they are represented in the diagram, in jiuvtaposition

with the spectrum of the star. By such an arrangement it is possible to

determine with great accuracy whether or not any of these bright lines
actually coincide with any of the dark ones.

    The results on these stars are given in the following Table :

   Now, in reference to all these elements, the evidence does not rest upon
the coincidence of one lino, which would be worth but little, but upon the

coincidence of a group of two, three, or four lines, occurring in different
parts of the spectrum. Other corresponding lines are probably also present,
but the faintness of the star's light limited the comparisons to the stronger

lines of each element.

   What elements do the numerous other lines in the star represent ? Some

of them are probably due to the vapours of other terrestrial elements which

we have not yet compared with these stars. But may not some of these
hnes be the signs of primary forms of matter unknown upon the earth?
Elements new to us may here show themselves, which form large and

important series of compounds, and therefore give a special character to the
physical conditions of these remote systems. In a similar manner the spectra
of terrestrial substances have been compared with several other stars.

        /3 Pegasi contains sodium, magnesium, and perhaps barium.
        Sirius contains sodium, magnesium, iron, and hydrogen.
        a Lyr£e (Vega) contains sodium, magnesium, iron.
        Pollux contains sodium, magnesium, iron.

   About sixty other stars have been examined, all of which appear to have
some elements in common "with the sun and earth, but the selective grouping
of the elements in each star is probably peculiar and unique.

  A few stars, however, stand out from the rest, and appear to bo charac-

terized by a peculiarity of great significance. These stars are represented by

these stars is peculiar, but the remarkable and exceptional feature of their
spectra is the absence of the two lines which indicate hydrogen, one line in
the red, and the other in the green. These lines correspond to Praunhofer's
C and F. The absence of these hues in some stars shows that the lines

C and F are not due to the aqueous vapour of our atmosphere.

    It is worthy of consideration that the terrestrial elements which appear
most widely diffused through the host of stars are precisely some of those
which ai-e essential to life, such as it exists upon the earth, namely, hydro-
gen, sodium, magnesium, and iron. Besides, hydrogen, sodium, and magne-

sium represent the ocean, which is an essential part of a world constituted

like the earth.

  We learn from these observations that iti plan of structure the stars, or at

least the brightest of them, resemble the sun. Their light, Hke that of the
sun, emanates from intensely white-hot matter, and passes through an atmo-
sphere of absorbent vapours. With this unity of general plan of structure,

there exists a great diversity amongst the individual stars. Star differs

from star in chemical constitution. May we not believe that the individual

peculiarities of each star are essentially connected with the special purpose

which it subserves, and with the living beings which may inhabit the
planetary worlds by which it may possibly be surrounded.

   When they had obtained this new information respecting the true nature

of the stars, their attention was directed to the phenomena Avhich specially
distinguish some of the stars.

                  COLOITES OF THE SxARS.

   The colour of the light of the stars which are bright to the naked eye is
always some tint of 7'ed, orange, or yellow. When, however, a telescope is
employed, in close companionship with many of these ruddy and orange
stars, other fainter stars become visible, the colour of which may be blue, or

green, or purjjle.

   Now it appeared to be probable that the origin of these differences of

colour among the stars may be indicated by their spectra. It was obvious

that if the dark lines of absorption were more numerous or stronger in some

part of the spectrum, then those colours would be subdued in power, rela-

tively to the colour in which few lines onlj- occur. These latter colours

remaining strong would predominate, and give to the light, originally white,

their own tints.

   This supposition was confirmed by observations of the spectra of several
white and coloured stars. The grouping of the dark lines in the stars Sirius,
a Lyras, a Herculis, jl Cj'gni, and some othei's which were examined for this
purpose, was such as to account for the difference of colour exhibited by their
light. The spectra of the two stars forming Cygni are represented in

                                                                                                                                       ft

fig. 4, Plate III.

    It appears, therefore, that the colours of the stars are in general produced
by the vapours existing in their atmosphere. The chemical constitution of a
star's atmosphere will depend upon the elements existing in the star and upon

its temperature.

                  Variable Stars.

The brightness of many of the stars is found to bo variable. From night

to night, from month to month, or from season to season, their light mav be

observed to be continually changing, at one time increasing, at another time
diminishing. The careful study of these variable stars by nixmerous ob-

servers has shown that their continual changes do not take place in an
uncertain or irregular manner. The greater part of these remarkable objects

was and wane in accordance with a fixed law of periodic variation which is

peculiar to each.

    The speaker stated that he had been seeking for some time to thi'ow light
upon this strange phenomenon by means of observation of their spectra. If
in any case the periodic variation of brightness is associated with physiml
changes occurring in the star, we might obtain some information by means of

the prism. Again, if the diminution in brightness of a star should be caused

by the interposition of a dark body, then in that case, if the dark body be
surrounded with an atmosphere, its presence might possibly be revealed to us
by the appearance of additional lines of absorption in the spectrum of the
star when at its minimum. Some small changes have been suspected, but
further observations are required before any conclusion can be with certainty
deduced from them.

                                           Tempoeaet Stars.

    With the variable stars modern opinion would associate the remarkable
 phenomeua of the so-called new stars which occasionally, but at long-
intervals, have suddenly appeared in the sky. But in no case has a per-
manently Inight star been added to the heavens. The splendour of all these
 objects was temporary only, thoiigh whether they died out or still exist as
 extremely faint stars is uncertain. In the case of the two modern temporary
 stars, the one seen by Mr. Hind in 1845, and the bright star recently observed

 in Corona, though they have lost their ephemeral glory, they still continue
 as stars of the 10th and 11th magnitude.

    The old theories respecting these strange objects must be rejected. "We
 cannot believe, with Tycho Brahe, that objects so ephemeral are neiv creations,
 nor with Iliccioli, that they are stars brilliant on one side only, which have
 been suddenly turned round by the Deity. The theory that they have sud-
 denly darted, towards us with a velocity greater than that of light, from a
 region of I'cmote invisibility, "^vill not now find supporters.

    On the 12th of May last a star of the 2nd magnitude suddenly burst forth

 in the constellation of the Northern Crown. Thanks to the Idndness of the
 first discoverer of this phenomenon, Mr. Birmingham, of Tuam, the speaker
 was enabled, conjointly with Dr. MiUer, to examine the spectrum of this star
 on the 16th of May, when it had not fallen much below the 3rd magnitude.

    The spectrum of this star consists of two distinct spectra. One of these is
 formed of four bi'ight lines. The other spectrum is analogous to the spectra
 of the sun and stars.

    These two spectra represent two distinct sources of light. Each spectrum
 is formed by the decomposition of light, which is independent of the light
 which gives birth to the other spectrum.

     The continuous spectrum, crowded Avith groups of dark lines, shows that

 there exists a photosphere of incandescent solid or liquid matter. Further,

 that there is an atmosphere of cooler vapoiu-s, which give rise, by absorption,
 to the group of dark lines.

     So far the constitution of this object is analogous to that of the sun and
 stars ; but, in addition, there is the second spectrum, which consists of bright
 lines. There is therefore a second and distinct source of light, and this must

 be, as the character of the spectrum shows, luminous gas. Now the two

principal of the bright lines of this spectnim inform us, by their position,
that one of the luminous gases is hydrogen. The great brightness of

these lines shows that the luminous gas is hotter than the photosphere.

These facts, taken in connexion with the suddenness of the outburst of

light in the star and its immediate very rapid decline in brightness, from

the 2nd magnitude down to the 8th magnitude in tivelve days, suggested the

startling speculation that the star had become suddenly enrapt in thejiames of

luminous or burning hydrogen. In consequence, it may be, of some great

Aconvulsion enormous quantities of gas were set free.  large part of this gas

consisted of hydrogen, which was either intensely glowing, or burning about

the star in combination with some other element. This flaming gas emitted
the Light represented by the spectrum of bright lines. The spectrum of the

other part of the star's light may show that this fierce gaseous conflagration

had heated to a more vivid incandescence the solid matter of the photosphere.
As the free hydrogen became exhausted the flames gradually abated, the
photosphere became less vivid, and the star waned down to its former

brightness.

  We must not forget that light, though a swift messenger, requires time to

pass from the star to us. The great physical convulsion, which is new to us,

is already an event of the past with respect to the star itself. For years

the star has existed under the new conditions which followed this fiery

catastrophe.

                       Nebtjlje.

   When the eye is aided by a telescope of even moderate power, a large

number of faintly laminoiis patches and spots come forth from the darkness

of the sky, which are in strong contrast with the brilliant but point-like

Aimages of the stars.  few of these objects may be easily discerned to con-

sist of very faint stars closely aggregated together. Many of these strange

objects remain, even in the lai'gest telescopes, unresolved into stars, and

resemble feebly shining clouds or masses of phosphorescent haze. During

the last 150 years the intensely important question has been continually

before the mind of astronomers, " What is the true nature of these faint,

comet-like masses ? "

The interest connected with an answer to this question has much increased

Wm.since Sir  Herschel suggested that these objects are portions of the pri-

mordial material out of which the existing stars have been fashioned ; and

further, that in these objects we may study some of the stages through

which the siins and planets pass in their development from luminous cloud.

The telescope has failed to give any certain information of the nature of

the nebulse. It is true that each successive increase of aperture has resolved
more of these objects into bright points, but at the same time other fainter
nebulae have been brought into view, and fantastic wisps and diffused

patches of light have been seen, which the mind almost refuses to believe
can be due to the imited glare of innumerable suns still more remote.

    Spectrum analysis, if it could be successfully applied to objects so exces-
sively faint, was obvioiisly a method of investigation specially suitable for
determining whether any essential physical distinction separates the nebulae
from the stars.

   The speaker selected for the first attempt, in August 1864, one of the

class of small, but comparatively bright .nebulae.
   His surprise was very great, on looking into the small telescope of the

spectrum apparatus, to perceive that there was no appearance of a band of
coloured light, such as a star would give ; but in place of this, there were

                                                                    m2

three isolated hriglit lines only. The spectrum of this nebula is represented
in fig. 5 of Plate HI.

This observation was sufficient to solve the long-agitated inquiry in refer-

ence to this object at least, and to show that it was not a group of stars, but

a true nehulxi.

  A spectrum of this character, so far as our knowledge at present extends,

can be produced only by light which has emanated from matter in the state
of gas. The light of this nebula, therefore, was not emitted from incan-
descent solid or liquid matter, as is the light of the suu and stars, but from

gloiving or luminous gas.

It was of importance to learn, if possible, from the position of these

bright lines, the chemical nature of the gas or gases of which this nebula

consists.

Measures taken by the micrometer of the most brilliant of the bright

lines showed that this line occurs in the spectrum very nearly in the position

of the brightest of the lines in spectrum of nitrogen. The experiment was
then made of comparing the spectrum of nitrogen directly with the bright
lines of the nebultie. The speaker found that the brightest of the lines of

the ncbulaj coincided with the strongest of the group of lines which are

peculiar to nitrogen. It may be, therefore, that the occui'reuce of this one

line only indicates a form of matter more elementary than nitrogen, and

which our analysis has not yet enabled us to detect.
   In a similar manner the faintest of the lines was found to coincide with

the line of hydrogen coincident with F.

   The middle line of the three lines which form the spectrum of the nebula
does not coincide with any very strong line in the spectra of about thirty of

the terrestrial elements. It is not far from a Line of barium, but it does
not coincide with it. Besides these bright lines there was also an exceedingly
faint continuous spectrum. The spectrum had no apparent breadth, and

must thercfoi'e have been formed by a minute point of light. Its position,

crossing the bright line about the middle, showed that the point of light was

situated about the centre of the nebula. Now this nebula possesses a mi-

Wenute but bright nucleus.  learn from this observation that the matter

of the nucleus is almost certainly not in a state of gas, as is the material of

the surrounding nebiila. It consists of opake matter, which may exist in

tlie form of an incandescent fog of solid or liquid particles.

   The new and unexpected rcsidts arrived at by the prismatic examination
of this nebula sliowed the importance of examining as many as possible of
these remarkable bodies. Would all the nebula give similar spectra? Espe-

cially it was of importance to ascertain whether those nebulas which the

telescope had certainly resolved into a close aggregation of bright points

would give a spectrum indicating gaseitj'.

   The observation with the prism of these objects is extremely difficult, on
account of their great faintness. Besides this, it is only when the skj^ is
very clear and the moon is absent that the prismatic examination of their

light is even possible. During the last two years the speaker has examined

the spectra of more than GO nebulaj and clusters. These may be divided into

two groat groups. One group consists of the nebula) which give a spec-

trum similar to the one already described, or else of one or two oiily of the
three bright lines. Of the 60 objects examined about one-third belong to
the class of gaseous bodies. The light from the remaining fort}- nebula; and

clusters becomes spread out by the prism into a spectrum which is apparently

continuous.

A remarkable nebula, and possibly one of the nearest to our system, of the

nebulae presenting a ring formation, is the well-known Annular Nebula in
Lyra. The spectrum consists of one bright line only. 'When the slit of the

instrument crosses the nebula, the line consists of two brighter portions cor-

Aresponding to the sections of the ring.                          much fainter line joins them,

which shows that the faint central portion of the nebula has a similar con-

stitution.

  A nebula remarkable for its large extent and peculiar form is that known

as the Dumh-heJl Nebula. The spectrum of this nebula consists of one line

Aonly.  prismatic examination of the light from diflFerent parts of this

object, showed that it is throughout of a similar constitution.

The most widely known, perhaps, of all the nebulae is the remarkable

cloud-like object in the sword-handle of Orion.

This object is also gaseoirs. Its spectrum consists of three bright lines.

Lord Eosse informed the speaker that the bluish-green matter of the nebula

has not been resolved by his telescope. In some parts, however, he sees a
large number of very minute red stars, which, though apparently connected

with the irresolvable matter of the nebula, are yet doubtless distinct from it.

These stars would be too faiut to furnish a visible spectrum.

All the true Clusters, which are resolved by the telescope into distinct

bright points, give a spectrum, which does not consist of separate bright

lines, but is apparently continuous in its light. There are many nebulee

which furnish a similar spectrum.

As an example of these nebula?, the gi'eat nebula in Andromeda may be

taken, which is visible to the naked eye, and is not seldom mistaken for a

comet. The spectrum of this nebula, though apparently continuous, has

some suggestive peculiarities. The whole of the red and part of the orange

are wanting, besides this eliaracter, the brighter parts of the spectrum have

a very unequal and mottled appearance.

    It is remarkable that the easily resolved cluster in Hercules has a spec-

trum precisely similar. The prismatic connexion of this cluster with the
nebula in Andromeda is confirmed by telescopic observation. Lord Eosse

has discovered in this cluster dark streaks or lines similar to those which are

seen in the nebula in Andromeda.

   In connexion with these observations, it was of great interest to ascertain
whether this broad classification afforded by the prism of the nebula? and
clusters, would correspond with the indications of resolvability furnished by
the telescope. Would it be found that all the rinrcsolved ncbulce are gaseous,
and that those which give a continuous sj^ectrum are clusters of stars?

   Lord Oxmantowu has examined all the observations of the 60 nebulae and
clusters in the speaker's list, Avhich have been made with the great reflecting

telescope erectecl by his father, the Earl of Eosse.

Considering the great difficulty of successful telescopic obrervation of these
150 REPORT--1868.

objects, the correspondence between the results of prismatic and telescopic

observation may be regarded as close and suggestive.

   Half of the nebulae which give a continuous spectrum have been resolved,
and about one-third more are probably resolvable ; while of the gaseous

--nebidse none have been certainly resolved, according to Lord Rosse.
   The inquiry now presses itself iipon us What superstructure of interpre-
tation have we a right to raise upon the new facts with which the prism has

furnished us ?
    Is the existence of the gaseous nebulse an evidence of the reality of that

primordial nebulous matter required by the theories of Sir William Herschel

and Laplace ?

   Again, if we do not accept the view that these nebulae are composed of

portions of the original elementary matter out of which suns and planets have

been elaborated, what is the cosmical rank and relation which we ought to
assign to them ? As aids to ii, future determination of these great questions,
some other observations made by the speaker may be briefly referred to.

                                    Comets,

There are objects in the heavens which occasionally, and under some con-

ditions, resemble closely some of the nebulae. In some positions in their

orbits some of the comets appear as round vaporous masses, and except by

their motion, cannot be distinguished from nebulae. Docs this occasional

general resemblance indicate a similarity of nature ? In 1864 Donati found

that the spectrum of a comet visible in that year consisted of hrirjlit lines.

Last January a small telescopic comet was visible. It was a nearly circular,

very faint vaporous mass. Nearly in the centre, a small and rather dim

niicleus was seen. When this object was viewed in the spectroscope, two

Aspectra were distinguished.  very faint continuoas spectrum of the coma

showed that it was visible by reflecting the solar light. About the middle of

this faint spectrum, a bright point was seen. This bright point is the spec-

trum of the nucleus, and shows that its light is diflerent from that of the

coma. This short bright line indicates that the nucleus of this comet was

self-luminous ; and further, the position of this line of the spectrum suggests

that the material of the comet might possibly be similar to the matter of

which the gaseous nebulas consist.

               Measures of the intrinsic liRioHTNEss of the Nebttl^.

    It appeared to the speaker that some information of the nature of the
nebulae might be obtained from observations of another order. If physical
changes of the magnitude necessary for the conversion of these gaseous bodies

into suns are now in progress in the nebulas, surely this process of develop-

ment would be accompanied by marked changes in the intrinsic brightness of
their light, and in their size.

  Now since the spectroscope shows these bodies to be continuous masses of

gas, it is possible to obtain an approximate measure of their real hri(/7ilness.

It is known that as long as a distant object remains of sensible size, its bright-
ness remains unaltered. By a new photometric method the intrinsic inten-

sity of the light of three of the gaseous nebula) was found in terms of a sperm
candle burning at the rate of 1.58 grains per hour.

    These numbers represent not the ajjjxtnnt brightness only, but the true

brightness of these luminous masses, except so far as it may have been

diminished by a possible power of extinction existing in eosmical space, and
by the absorption of our atmosphere. It is obvious that similar observations,

made at considerable intervals of time, may show whether the light of these

objects is undergoing increase or diminution, or is subject to a periodic vari-
ation. If the dumb-bell nebula, the feeble light of which is not more than
one twenty-thousandth part of that of a candle, be in accordance with popular
theory a sun-germ, then it is scarcelj' possible to put in an intelligble form

the enormous number of times by which its light must increase before this
faint nebula, feebler now in its glimmering than a rushlight, can rival the

dazzling splendour of our sun.

measurement. By means of a series of micrometric observations, it will bo
possible to ascertain whether any considerable alteration in size takes place

in nebulae.

    Mr. Alexander Herschel has recently succeeded in subjecting another order

of the heavenly bodies to prismatic analysis. He has obtained the spectrum

of a bright meteor, and also the spectra of some of the trains which meteors

Aleave behind them.  remarkable result of his observations appears to be

that sodium in the state of luminous vapour is present in the trains of most

meteors,

                                                                                                CONCLTISION.

In conclusion, the new knowledge that has been gained from these obser-

vations with the prism may be summed up as follows :

  AU1. the brighter stars, at least, have a structure analogous to that of the

Bun.

2. The stars contain material elements common to the sun and earth.

3. The colours of the stars have their origia in the chemical constitution of

the atmospheres which surround them.

4. The changes in brightness of some of the variable stars are attended

witli changes in the lines of absorption of tlieir spectra.

5. The phenomena of the star in Corona appear to show that in this object

at least great physical changes arc in operation.

6. There exist in the heavens true nebulce. These objects consist of

luminous gas.

  A7. part of the light of comets is self-luminous.

   8. The bright points of the star-clusters may not bo in all cases stars of

the same order as the separate bright stars.

   It may be asked what eosmical theory of the origin and relations of the

heavenly bodies do these new facts suggest? It would be easy to speculate,

but it appears to me that it would not be philosophical to dogmatize at present

on a subject of which we know so very Httlc. Our views of the universe are

undergoing  important changes                                                                   let  us  wait  for  more  facts  mth  minds  un-

On some further Results of Spectrum Analysis as applied to the

Two years ago, at the ITeeting of the British Association at Nottingham, I
had the honour to give, in an evening discourse, a summary of the results

of Spectrum Analysis as applied to the heavenly hodies, which had been
obtained partly by myself and partlv as the conjoiut work of myself and

Dr. W. AUeu Miller, Trcas. and Y.P.E.S.
   I beg now to offer to the Association a brief accoimt of some of the prin-

cipal results of the observations which I have made since August 1866.
   These observations may be arranged according to the classes of the hea-

veuly bodies to which they relate.

   The determination of the proper motions of stars from observations of
their angular motions among the stars apparently near them, gives to us

information of that part only of their motion whick is at right angles to a
ray of light coming from the star to the observer. It would be a rare acci-
dent only if the motion thus obtained represented the whole of their motion.
The other part of tlie star's motion, namely, the movement of the star in the

direction of the visual ray towards or from the earth, seemed to be beyond
the reach of our means of observation ; for photometric estimation of the

increase or diminution of the light of the star was obviously too coarse and
uncertain a method for so delicate an investigation.

   Now it is precisely information on this point which appeared to be inacces-

sible to us, which has been brought within our reach by means of observa-
tions with the prism. Supposing waves to be coming in upon the shore, a

ship leaving the harbour would encounter a larger number of these waves in

a given time than a ship would at anchor ; and further, the increased velo-

city of succession of the waves which would strike its x^row could be deter-
mined if the velocity of the ship and that of the Avaves were known. Con-

versely, if the period and the velocity of the waves had been ascertained, the

captain, by counting the number of waves which met the ship in a given

Ainterval of time, could determine therefrom the motion of his vessel.  little

consideration will make it evident that a similar effect would take place if

the vessel were at rest, and the source of wave-motion were supposed to

approach or recede from the vessel ; in this case the velocity of the soiircc

of wave-motion coirld be determined, if the initial period of the waves and

the velocity of their propagation were known. This illustration sets forth

the principles on which is founded the method of investigation which is now

to be described.

The idea that a change of period in hmiinons or sonorous waves would

arise in consequence of a motion of the observer, or of the source of the light,

SPECTEUM ANALYSIS OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES.                                                                          153

or of the sound, towards or from each other, is due to Doppler. In 1841
Doppler showed that since the impression which is received by the eye or
the ear does not depend upon the intrinsic strength and period of the
waves of light and of sound, but is determined by the interval of time in
wliich they fall upon the organ of the observer, it follows that the colour
and intensity of an impression of light and the pitch and strength of a sound

will be altered by a motion of the source of the light or of the sound, or by
a motion of the observer, towards or from each other *.

    Doppler then went wrong ; for he sought by these considerations to account

for the remarkable difference of colour which some of the binary stars present
and for some other phenomena of the heavenly bodies. IN^ow it is obvious

that if a star could be conceived to be moving with a velocity sufficiently

great to alter its colour sensibly to the cj-e, still no change of colour would
be perceived, for the reason that, beyond the visible spectrum, at both extre-

mities there exists a store of invisible waves which would be at the same time
exaltedor degraded into visibility to take the place of the waves which had
been raised or lowered in refrangibility by the star's motion. 'No change of

colour, therefore, could take place until the whole of these invisible waves of

force had been used up, which would only be the case when the relative
motion of the source of light and of the observer was several times greater

than that of light.

It is obvious from these considerations that this method of research could

afford us information of the motion of the star only in the case in which we

hieiv the period of the light at the time of its emission from the star ; for then a
comparison of this initial period with that observed "at the earth would show

the exact amount of the change of refrangibihty due to the relative motions of
the observer and the star, and as the earth's motions arc known, the motion

of the star could bo determined.

   Now this one essential condition, namely, the knowledge of the period of
the light when emitted by the star, is fulfilled by spectrum analysis. When

we learn the existence of a terrestrial substance in a star, we have the

means of knowing the initial refrangibility of the dark lines in the star's

spectrum, which are due to the absorption of the vapour of this substance.

   It may be thought that if the lines in the spectra of the stars are subject
to an unknown amount of displacement from the cause we have now under

consideration, it woidd not be possible to make use of these lines to learn the

star's chemical constitution. This objection, however, does not obtain ; for

the amount by which the lines would be displaced by any velocity we could

with probability assign to the stars, would be too small to be even perceived

in the spectroscopes which had hitherto been apj^lied to the heavenly bodies
Por example, a velocity ten times greater than that of the earth in its orbit
would cause a line to move through a space in the spectrum about as great as

trum. Besides this consideration, the trustworthiness of the results obtained
by myself and Dr. Miller in our joint researches, was not allowed to rest
upon the position of a single Hue, but upon the coincidence in general cha-

racter as well as in position of a groiqj of severed lines. At the time, indeed
when we made our observations, Ave were fully aware that these direct com-
parisons were not only of value for the determination of the chemical con-

stitution of the stars, but tliat they might tell us something of the motions

of the stars relatively to our system. The great velocity of light rehitively to
the known planetary velocities and to the probable motions of the few stars
of which the parallax is known, showed that any alterations of position which
might be expected from this cause in the lines of the stellar spectra would
not exceed a fraction of the interval between the double line D, a change
which could not be detected in our instrument. "VVe were, however, in pos-
session of the information that the stars, the spectra of Avhieh had been com-
pared with the necessary care, were not moving towards or from the earth

with a velocity so great as 190 miles per second. Among these stars are

Aldebaran, a Oriouis, (i Pegasi, Sirius, a Lyrce, CapeUa, Arcturus, Pollux,
and Castor.

   Hecently (in 1866) Klinkerfues published a memoir on the influence of the
motion of a source of light upon the refrangibihty of its rays, and described
therein a series of observations, from which he deduces certain amounts of
motion in the case of some objects observed by him. As Klinkerfues em-
ploys an achromatic prism, it does not seem possible by his method to obtain
any information of the motions of the stars ; for in such a prism the difference
of period of the luminous waves would be as far as jjossible annulled. It is,
however, conceivable that his observations of the light when travelling from

E. to W., and from W. to E., might show a difference in the two cases,

arising from the earth's motion through the ether *.
    Eather Secchi has quite recently called attention to this subject. In his

paper he states that he has not been able to detect any change of rcfraugi-
bility in the case of certain stars of an amount equal to the difference
between the components of the double line D. These results are in accord-
ance with those obtained by Dr. Miller and myself in 1803, so far as they
refer to the stars whith had been examined by us. Eather Secchi's method
of using an unrefracted image as a fiducial mark, with diverging rays pass-

ing through the prisms, might, it is conceivable, be open to objection. He

appears to consider that, to produce a certain alteration of refrangibility, half

the velocity would be required in the case of the approach of a star, of that
which would be necessary if the star were receding. This is not the caso
for equal velocities of separation or approach give equal change of wave-

length. It is true that a difference of an octave is produced by a relative
velocity of separation equal to that of light, and by a velocity of approach
equal to half that of light ; but the difference in length of a wave and its
octave below (which is twice as long) is, in the same proportion, greater tliau
the difference between it and the octave above (which is half as long) t-

   The subject of the influence of the motions of the heavenly bodies on the
index of refraction of light had already (in 1864) occupied the attention of
Mr. Maxwell, E.R.S., Avho made some experiments in an analogous direction.

In the spring of last year Mr. Maxwell sent to me a statement of his views
and experiments, which he has permitted me to include in a paper pre-
sented by me to the Itoyal Society^.

   Mr. Maxwell puts the subject in the following way :
    " Let a source of light be such that it produces n disturbances or vibra-

tions per second, and let it be at such a distance from the earth that the

light requires a time T to reach the earth. Let the distance of the source

of light from the earth be altered, either by the motion of the source of light,

   " If, therefore, the light of a star be due to sodium, or be absorbed by vapour

of sodium, then the light, when it reaches the earth, will have an excess or
defect of rays whose period of vibration is to that of the period of sodium as

V+w is to V."

   There is another quite distinct way in which, under some circumstances,

it is conceivable that an alteration of refraugibility might take place. If

the motion of the luminiferous medium be different from that of the earth,
that is, does not accompany the earth in its motion, a deviation might be
exjjeeted, according to the direction of the ray within the prisms. The essen-
tials of this experiment are entirely terrestrial, and depend only on the
relative motion of the prism and the luminiferous medium, and on the direc-
tion in which the ray passes through the prism. Mr. Maxwell has made
some careful experiments in this direction, but has obtained only negative

results.

mySeveral of  early attempts failed in consequence of insufficient disper-

sive power in the apparatus employed. It was only after several quite dis-

tinct forms of apparatus were successively constructed, that I succeeded in

obtaining an instrument suitable for these very dehcate observations.

  A serious difficulty presented itself from the inconvenience, and in some

degree untrustworthiness for this investigation, of the ordinary method of

reflecting into the instrument a spectrum of comparison, bj' means of a small
prism placed over one half of the slit, even when the precautions described

in my papers presented to the Eoyal Society, for the purpose of ensuring

perfect accuracy in relative position in the instrument of the star-spectrum

with that to be compared with it, were carefully observed.

  A description of the apparatus which I finally adopted, and which appears

in all respects trustworthy, is contained in the paper presented to t]ie lloyal

Society. This apparatus gave an amount of dispersion equal to about seven

prisms of dense flint glass of 60°.

   The chief difficulties I encountered arose from the unsteadiness of oiu-
atmosphere. Stars of the first and second magnitude give sufficient Hght for

examination with tlie large spectroscope described ; but unless the air is ex-
ceptionally steady, the lines are seen too fitfully to permit of any certainty

in the determination of coincidence, of the great degree of delicacy required.

From this cause, the work of very many nights has had to be rejected. I

will describe here those observations only which have led to a successful

--result.
   Siriiis. The l)rilliant light of Sirius, and the great intensity of four strong

mylines of its spectrum, made this star specially suitable for                                                                                                                purpose,

hydrogen, hfid been satisfactorily determined by myself and Dr. Miller in

We18G3.  found also in the star lines coincident with some of those of iron,

magnesium, and sodium. Of all these lines, the one -which corresponds to F

of the solar spectrum was alone seen with the steady distinctness necessary

for comparison, when the powerful train of prisms was used.

We have sufficient proof from our observations referred to, that this line

is produced by hydrogen ; at the time, therefore, of its formation at the
star, its period would be identical with that of the corresponding line of

hydrogen.
    This line in the star appears rather broader than in the solar spectrum

it includes, perhaps, a range of wave-length about equal to that of the sepa-

ration of the double line I) ; it is in a small degree nebulous at both edges.

   As the corresponding bright hue of the spectrum of hydrogen, when the

spai'k is taken in hydrogen at the pressure of the atmosphere, is too expanded
for accurate comparison, the hydrogen was employed as it exists in the so-
called vacuum-tubes. In this state the hydrogen gives a narrow and well-

defined line.

   The result of a great many comparisons on many nights is to show that

the bright line of hydrogen is, in a small degree, more refrangible than the
dark line in the star (see fig. 4, PL V.). The amount of degradation in
wave-length which the line had sutlered, was found to be equal to 0'109 mil-

lionth of a millimetre.

   If the velocity of light be taken at 185,000 miles per second, and the

wave-length of F at 480-50 millionths of a metre, the alteration in period

observed in the line of Sirius will indicate a motion of recession between the
earth and the star of 41-4 miles per second.

   Of this motion a part is due to the earth's motion in space. As the earth
moves round the sun in the plane of the ecliptic, it is changing the direction
of its motion at every instant. There are two positions separated bj^ 180°,
where the effect of the earth's motion is a maximum, namely, when it is
moving in the direction of the visual ray, either towards or from the star.
At two other positions in its orbit, at 90° from the former positions, the
earth's motion is at right angles to the directiou of the light from the star,
and therefore has no influence on the refrangibility of its light.

    The position of the star is also of importance ; for the effect of the earth's
motion will be greatest upon the light of a star situated in the plane of the
ecliptic, and will decrease as the star's latitude increases, until, with respect

to a star at the pole of the ecliptic, the earth's motion, during tlie whole of
its annual course, will be perpendicular to the direction of the light coming to
us from it, and will be therefore without influence on the period of the light.

   Now at the time the observations on Sirius were made, the earth was

moving from the star with a velocity of twelve miles per second. There
remains, tJierefore, a motion from the earth of 29-4 miles per second, which

ai^pears to hehvr/ to the star itself.

   The solar motion in space will not materially affect this result; for, ac-
cording to Struve, the sun advances in space Avith a velocity but little
greater than one-fourth of the earth's orbital motion. If the apex of the
solar motion be situated in Hercules, nearly the whole of it will be from
Sirius, and will therefore diminish the velocity to be ascribed to that star.

    It is interesting to remark that at the present time the proper motion of
Sirius in declination is less than its average amount by nearly the whole of

that part of it which is subject to variation. It may be that a greater part
of the star's motion is now in the direction of the visual ray.
SPECTRUM ANALYSIS OP THE HEAVENLY BODIES.  157

    It must not be forgotten that the whole of the proper motion which can
be directly observed by us, consists of that portion only which is at right

angles to the visual ray. This motion, according to the parallax wo attri-
bute to Sirius (IIendersou=0"-150, Abbe=0"-27), wiU vary from 24 miles
to 43 miles per second.

    The real motion of the star will consist of this motion, combined with the
motion at right angles to it, obtained by the present investigation, of 29 miles

from the earth.
    Similar observations have been made of several other stars ; I desire, how-

ever, to submit them to a re-examination.

                  B. Other Spectroscopic Observations of the Fixed Stars.

  --a Herculis. On several occasions the spectrum of this star was re-ex-

amined. The observations agree with the measures and comparisons of

the chemical elements of this star obtained in 1863. The spectrum is con-
tinuous, with numerous groups of dark lines.

    Mira Ceti gives a spectrum apparently identical,, or nearly so, with a
Ononis. At the time the star was waning in brightness there was an appear-

 ance of greater intensity in several of the groups, but further observations
are reqiiired before any opinion is hazarded as to the cause of its remarkable

 periodical variation in brightness.

  --y Cassiopeiie. In addition to the bright line near the boundary of the

green and blue observed by Father Secchi, I discovered a line of equal bril-
liancy in the red. There are also in the spectrum of this star dark lines due
to absorption. The two bright lines are narrow and defined, but are not
veiy brilliant. Micrometrical measures of these bright lines show that they

are doubtless coincident in position in the spectrum with Frauuhofer's C and
 F, and with two of the bright lines of luminous hydrogen.

   I have confirmed the interesting observations of MM. Wolf and Rayet, so

far as to the presence of bright lines in the three small stars described by
them. I have not determined the number and positions of these lines.

                              § II. Observations of the Nebula.

   My observations on these bodies have confirmed the results of my former

investigation, but have not afi:brded much iuformation which is new. Out

 of about seventy nebulaj, nearly one-third gave a spectrum of bright lines.

    The differences which have been observed between the spectra of the

 objects which give bright lines, may be regarded as modifications only of the

 typical form of spectrum represented in fig. 2. PI. V.
    The variations consist of differences of relative intensity, and, in some

 cases, of the absence of one or two of the lines. It is worthy of remark
 that, so for as the nebula) have been observed, the brightest of the three
 lines, which is coincident with a. line of nitrogen, is always present, and
 sometimes the spectrum consists wholly of this line. It is a suggestive fact
 that in no nebula have any additional lines been observed on the less refran-

 gible and brighter side of the line common to all the nebula). In two or
 three nebuke a fourth line, more refrangible than those represented in the

 diagram, has been detected.

    The spectrum of the Great Nebula in Orion was observed and compared
 with terrestrial lines, in the powerful spectroscope described in this paper.

     The coincidence of the strongest line with a double line of nitrogen, though

 now subjected to a much more severe trial (to a spreading out of the spec-
 trum nearly three times greater than iu my former observations), appeared

 as perfect as before.
--158 REPORT 1868.

   I was not able, even with this great dispersive power, and after long and
careful scrutiny directed to this point, to discover any duplicity in the line

of the nebula corresponding to that which characterizes the line of nitrogen.

The line of the nebula appeared to me narrower, under the same circum-
stances of slit, than the double line of nitrogen ; but the latter line may

have appeared broader in consequence of irradiation, as it was brighter
than the line of the nebula. It is worthy of remark that when the induc-
tion spark was placed before the object-glass, the line of nitrogen was so
much fainter that it ceased to appear double, and resembled the nebidar

lino *.

   The third lino of this nebida was also compared, with equal care, with the
narrow line of hydrogen when the spark is taken in rarefied hydrogen. The
coincidence of the line of the nebula with that of hydrogen appeared to be

perfect.

Now these coincidences with hydrogen and nitrogen were made with an

appnratus in which a difference in wave-length of 0-0460 millionth of a

millimetre would have been detected. The great probability that these lines

are emitted by hydrogen and nitrogen existing in the nebula, appears by

Wethese observations to be strengthejicd almost to certainty.     learn also

that the nebula was not receding from us with a velocity greater than 10

miles per second ; for this motion, in addition to the earth's motion in the

same direction at the time, would have caused a want of coincidence that

could have been observed. If, however, the nebula were approaching us it

might have a velocity as great as 20 miles per second ; for part of this motion

would be annulled by the earth's motion in a contrary direction.

It was found that when the intensity of tlio spectrum of nitrogen was

greatly diminished by removing the induction-spark in nitrogen to a dis-

tance from the slit, the whole spectrum disappeared with the exception of

the double line, which agrees in position with the line in the nebulte, so

that under these circumstances the spectrum of nitrogen resembled the mono-

chromatic spectnim of some nebuloe. It is obvious that if the spectrum of

hydrogen were similarly reduced in intensity, the strong line in the blue,

which corresponds to the third line of the nebular ^wctrum, woidd remaia

visible after the line in the red and the lines more refrangible than P had

become too feeble to affect the eye.
   These observations suggest the interesting question, whether the few lines

of the spectra of these objects represent the whole of the light emitted by
them, or whether these lines are the strongest lines only of their spectra
which have succeeded in reaching the earth. At present we have no posi-
tive evidence on this point. Since those bodies have a sensible diameter,
and in all probabilitj' present a continuous luminotis surface, we can hardly
suppose that any lines have been extinguished by the effect of the distance
of the objects from us. If we should ever have reason to believe that the
other lines which are present in the spectra of nitrogen and hydrogen are
quenched on their way to iis, we should, it seems, have to regard their dis-
appearance as an indication of a power of extinction residing in cosmical
space, similar to that which was suggested from theoretical considerations
by Cheseaux, and afterwards supported on other grounds by Olbers and the

elder Struve.

   * Seechi, indeecl, states that with his d'rect spectroscope this line in the annular nebula
in Lyva was double. As, liowevcr, the image of the nebula was viewed directly after

elongation by a cylindrical lens, and without a slit, it is probable that the two lines may

correspond to the two sides of the elongated annulus of the nebula.

                    § III. Obseetations of Comets,

   As soon as I had successfully applied the analysis by the prism to the
light of the nebulce, it appeared to me to be of great importance to subject

the light of comets to a similar examination, especially as we possessed no

certain knowledge of the intimate nature of these singular and enigmatical

bodies, or of the cosmical relations they may sustain to the solar system.
   Several attempts which I made to obtain a prismatic observation of Comet I.,

1864, were rendered unsuccessful by the position of the comet, and by un-
favourable weatlier. M. Donati sjicceeded in making an observation of its

spectrum. He describes it as consisting of three bright bands *.

   In the discourse I had the honour to give before the Association at Not-

tingham, I described the results of the analysis of a very small and faint

comet. Comet I. 1866. Its spectrum was compound, and showed that the

nucleus was self-luminous, and the surrounchng coma was visible by reflect-

ing solar light. The position of the bright line, into which the hght of the

nucleus was resolved, appeared, as far as the faintness of the object per-

mitted a determination, not to differ greatly from that of the brightest line

of the nebuloe. I was led by this circumstance to suggest that possibly the

material of the comet was similar to the matter of which the gaseous nebulae

Aconsist.  subsequent examination of three other comets, of which the

principal results vrill be given in this paper, shows that this suggestion of

the identity of the material of comets with that of some of the nebulae can-

not be maintained.

   The spectrum of a faint comet examined in May 1867 resembled that of

Comet I., 1866. The light of the self-luminous nucleus gave a line between
h and E, and the coma was represented by a continuous spectrum, which
showed that it reflected solar light.

                                                 Beorsen's Comet.

   From May 2 to May 13 I examined the spectrum of Brorsen's comet at

its reappearance in 1868. This comet was brighter than the two comets I
had previously examined ; and I was, from this cause, enabled to obtain a
fuller and more complete analysis of its light.

    Its spectrum, as seen in a spectroscope furnished with two prisms of dense
flint glass, with a refracting angle of 60°, is represented in fig. 2. PI. V.

   The comet appeared in the telescope as a nearly round nebulosity, in
which the light increases rapidly towards the centre, where on some occasions

I detected, I believe, a small nucleus.

   The spectrum consisted, for the most part, of three bright bands, into
which the light of the brighter portions of the coma was dispersed. These
bands I was unable to resolve into lines, oven when the slit was made narrow.

   The position of the bands was determined by micrometrical measures, and
also by the simultaneoiis comparison of them with the bright lines of mag-

nesium, sodium, hydrogen, and nitrogen. The brightest band, which may be

considered to represent about three-fourths of the whole light of the comet,
occurs between h and F, and is, in a small degree, less refrangible than the
line of nitrogen with which the brightest of the three lines of the nebulte is
coincident. The band in the blue was considerably more refrangible than
F, and was nearly as refrangible as the group of bright lines in the air-

my paper " On the Spectra of the Chemical Elements" *. The least refran-

gible of the bauds occurred in the yeUow portion of the spectrum at about

the distance from E of one-third of the interval which separates E from D.

    In Brorsen's comet, at the time of the observations, the whole of the bright
middle part of the nebulosity foi'ming the coma was self-luminous, and it
was only the extreme very faint portions of the object which gave a conti-
nuous spectrum.

                                              Comet II., 1868.

   On June 18 a comet was discovered by Dr. Winnecke at Carlsruhe, and

also independently the same night by M. Becquet, Assistant-Astronomer at

the observatory of Marseilles.

   On June 22 I examined this comet, which consisted of a nearly circular

coma, which became rather suddenly brighter towards the centre, where
there was a nearly round sjiot of light ; from this a tail was traced for nearly

a degree (see fig. 1. PI. Y.).

   When a spectroscope, furnished with two prisms of 60°, was applied to

the telescope, the light of the comet was resolved into three very broad bands,

which, as will be seen in the diagram, do not correspond exactly to the bright
bands of Brorsen's comet.

    In the two more refrangible bands the light was brightest at the less re-
frangible limit, and gradually diminished towards the other side of the bands.
In the middle and brightest band the gradation of light was not uniform,
but continued of nearly equal brilliancy for a distance from the less refran-
gible side of about one-third of the breadth of the band. Tliis band appeared
to be commenced at its brightest side by a distinct bright line.

    The least refrangible of the bands did not exhiliit a similar gradation of
brightness, but was rather brighter about the middle of its breadth.

   It will be seen, by a reference to the diagram (fig. 2. PL V.), that the two
more refrangible bands are longest at their brightest limits, and become shorter
in the same proportion as they become fainter. This appearance does not show
any difference between the light of the coma and of the bright central spot,

but arises from the circumstance that the light of the comet becomes gra-
 dually fainter from the centre towards the circumference ; and consequently
the light which the eye perceives in the spectrum, though similar through-
 out, is too feeble to be perceived at the ends, as the bands become fainter.
 This obvious explanation is shown to be the right one by the appearance of
 the least refrangible band, in Avhich a gradation of light did not take place.
 In this band the increase of light towards the centre of the coma showed
 itself as a bright axial line gradually fading off in both directions.

    "When the marginal positions of the coma were broiight upon the slit, the
 three bright bands could still be seen ; but when the light became verj''

 faint, the spectriim appeared to me to be continuous, but it was too faint to

 be traced beyond the positions of the bands, towards the violet, or the red.
 The tail was brought upon the slit, but I was unable, from its excessive faint-
 ness, to determine anything as to the character of its spectrum.

     The bands are laid down in the diagram from careful measures obtained

 with the micrometer-screw attached to the small telescope of the spectrum-
 apparatus. "When I compared the spectrum of the comet obtained in this

 way with some diagrams of the spectrum of carbon which I had jireparcd in
 1SG4, I was much interested to find that the three bands of the comet's

 spectrum agreed exactly, not onlj^ in position, but also in their general cha-

racters, with the spectrum of carbon as it appears when the iudiictiou-spark

is taken in a current of olefiant gas.

   These observations on the spectrum of carbon were undertaken in con-

tinuance of my researches on the " Spectra of the Chemical Elements." I

have not yet made them public, as they are not so complete as I hope to
make them.

It may be stated, as the general result of this investigation, that though

in all cases the essential features of the spectrum of carbon remained unal-

tered, certain small modifications were observed when the spectrum was

obtained under different conditions.

Two of these shghtly modified forms of the spectrum of carbon are given

in fig. 2. PL Y. The first spectrum was obtained by taking the induction-

spark between the points of platinum wires, sealed in glass tubes, and im-

mersed in olive-oil. This spectrum may be taken as exhibiting the typical

form of the spectrum of carbon. The brilliant line in the red part of the

spectrum, which is in a small degree less refrangible than the line of hydro-

gen corresponding to Fraunhofer's C, is not seen when carbon is heated in

the presence of hydrogen*.

The second spectrum in the diagram exhibits the slightly modified spectrum

which is produced when the induction-spark passes in a current of olefiant

gasf. It will be seen that the carbon emits light of the same refrangi-

bility as in the former case ; but the separate lines are no longer distinct,

and the shading is not resolved into the numerous fine lines which were then

visible. The very close agreement of the comet's spectrum with this form of

the spectrum of carbon showed the importance of comparing the two specti-a

directly in the spectroscope.

MyOn the following evening this was satisfactorily accomplished.         friend

Dr. W. Allen MiUer was present in the observatory on this evening, and kindly

took part in the observations which were made.

  A glass gas-holder, a (woodcut, p. 162), containing olefiant gas, was con-

nected by a flexible tube with a glass tube, b, into which platinum wires were

soldered. This tube was so fixed that the spark between the wires was suit-

ably reflected by the small mirror, c, into the spectroscope attached to the

telescope, so that the spectrum of carbon appeared directly below the spec-
trum of the comet.

   "We were satisfied that within the limits of the dispersive power of the

instrument employed, which may be taken at about the breadth of the double

line D, the two spectra were coincident, not only in the position of the bands,

but also in their general characters, and their relative brightness.

This du-ect comparison I repeated on June 2-5, with an equally satisfactory

result.

   The lines of hydrogen (which, of course, were present in the spectram of
the olefiant gas) were not to be seen in the spectrum of the comet.

   The very close resemblance of the spectrum of this comet to the spectrum

of carbon necessarily suggests the identity of the substances by which, in
both cases, the light was emitted, though indeed the great fixity of carbon
seems to raise a difiiculty in the way of accepting this conclusion. Some
two or three comets have been known to approach the sun sufficiently near

to acquire a temperature high enough to convert even carbon into vapour.
Indeed for such comets a body of some fixity seems to be necessarj\ With

respect to tlie majority of comets, which are subjected to a less fierce glare of

solar heat, it may be suggested that this supposed difficulty is one of degree
only; for we do not know of any conditions iinder which even a gas permanent

at the temperature of the earth could maintain sufficient heat to emit light

--a state of things which appears to exist permanently in the case of the

gaseous nebula).

    The important difference which exists between the spectrum of Brorsen's
comet and that of Comet II., 18G8, appears to show that the constitution of

comets may possibly not be in all cases the same. In a paper presented to

the Royal Society, I have ventured on some speculations with reference to the
bearing of these observations on certain phenomena which are usually exhi-
bited by comets.

                                  § IV. Observations of the Sitk.
    I have observed the sun with the spectroscope with three distinct objects
in view :
    1. To discover if the light from the less luminous part of the sun near
the limb gives a spectrum which differs in any respect from that which is
                                                                                      '

                SPECTRXJM ANALYSIS OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES.                    163

formed by the light from the bright central parts of the solar disk. I have

as yet failed to detect any difference.

2. It appeared possible that a view of the red prominences visible during

a solar eclipse might be obtained by reducing the light of our atmosphere
by means of prismatic dispersion ; for, under these circumstances, if the red

prominences give a spectrum of bright lines, these lines would remain but

little diminished in brightness, and might become visible. Observations with

this object in view have been made during the last two years by different

methods, but hitherto without success.

3. The third investigation, in which some success has been obtained, was

with a view to gain, from an examination of the spectra of the umbrse and

penumbrse of spots, some information as to the nature of these phenomena.
I had already made some observations in this direction, when, in August

186(3, I received a note from M. Faye, in which he suggests to me the

prismatic examination of solar spots with reference especially to the theo-

retical views of the sun proposed by him.

  My first observations were made with a small spectroscope, which Avas so

arranged that the imago of the sun was formed upon the slit after its heat
had been enfeebled by reflection from a prismatic solar eyepiece. The prin-

cipal solar lines were observed to be stronger in the spectrum of the light
from the umbra.

I use the term " umbra" to describe the whole of the dark part within the

penunibra, since it was not possible in these observations to distinguish the
two distinct parts of which, in most spots, it is seen to consist, namely, the
nucleus and the cloudy stratum, which were first described by Mr. Dawes.

In October 1866, Mr. Lockyer, Avho had independently made similar ob-

servations, presented a paper to the Royal Society. He observed the lines

to be thicker where they crossed a spot.

It was not until April 15, 1868, that a favourable opportunity occurred

to observe the spectrum of a spot with the powerful spectroscope described
in this paper. The spectroscope was rotated until the length of the slit was

in the direction of the length of the spot. When the middle of the umbra

was brought upon the slit, its spectrum appeared as a feebly illuminated
band upon the bright solar spectrum. The band appeared divided into two
parts by the spectrum of the bright prominence, which at the time ex-
tended nearly across the umbra. It was obvious that a part only of the
light which appeared to form the spectrum of the umbra came from that
region of the sun. The imperfect transparency of our atmosphere causes
it to become strongly illuminated when the sun shines upon the earth ; and
the brilliant light which is seen to be radiated by it near the sun's limb is

also radiated by that part of the atmosphere which is between the observer
and the sun.

   In order to determine how much of the light came from the atmosphere, I
made use of a graduated wedge of neutral-tint glass, which was first inter-

I posed before the eye when the atmosphere near the limb was upon the slit.

\ The wedge was moved until the lines ceased to be distinguishable. When

, the umbra was upon the slit, the wedge was agaiu moved so as to bring the
  same part of the spectrum to the same degree of obscurity, as nearly as could

j

I be judged by the inability of the eye to distinguish the lines. In this way

 it was  found  that,  roughly,  about  three-fourths  of  the  light  which  formed

; the spectrum of the umbra was really due to that part of the sun.

_ As, in consequence of the way in which the spectrum is formed, under

similar instrumental conditions the dark lines should appear rather thicker

when tlio light is feeble, the lines as they appeared in the still feebler light

of the atinosplicre near the sun's edge were carefully compared with the
same lines in the spectrum of the umbra. The lines in the former case,
though they appeared slightly stronger, were not so in a degree that could
be accepted as an explanation of the more marked increase of strength
which they presented in the spectrum of the umbra. There seemed, there-
fore, to be evidence of a peculiarity due to the light of the umbra itself.

    In the spectrum of the umbra, which was sufficiently extended to show
all the lines in Kirchhoff's maps, no lines were detected which were not also
present in the spectrum of the sun's normal surface, nor were any lines

observed to be wanting.

    The increase of thickness did not take place in the same proportion for all
the lines. The lines C and F, due to hydrogen, apj^eared to be increased but
in a very small degree, not more so than would be due to the feebler inten-

sity of the hght.

    There is a small group of lines a little less refrangible than h, at 1601 to

1609 of Kirchhoff's scale, and which in his map are marked as coincident
with chromium, which were increased in a very marked degree. The lines

D appeared in a small degree broader, as if by the addition of a faint and

narrow nebulosity at both edges (see fig. 3. PI. Y.). The group of lines at

B was stronger, also the lines b and E and many lines found by Kirchhoff
Fto be coincident with lines of iron. The absence of sensible increase in

was marked, in comparison with the greater strength of a line or lines, on
the less refrangible side of F, at about 2066-2 to 2067-1 of Kirchhoff's scale.

   No bright lines were detected in the spectrum of the umbra.
   It may be permitted to refer to some of the conditions of the solar surface
by which the phenomena observed might be brought about*.

  A cooler state of the heated vapours by which the dark lines of the solar

spectrum are produced Avould diminish the radiation from the gas itself, and
thus leave more completely uncompensated the absorption by the gas of the
light from behind it. Such a cause would produce increased blackness of the
lines, but would not account for more than a very slight apparent increase of

bj'eadth. Tlie greater breadth of the lines may point to a condition of the

solar vapours in which their power of absorption embraces, for each line, a

greater range of wave-length. Such an alteration we know to occur in
hydrogen as its tension increases. It may therefore be due to an increase

of the density of the vapours existing vs'ithin the umbra.

  We do not know from how a great a depth below the layer of bright gra-

nules the light came that we have now under considei'ation. Probably it
was emitted, for the most part, by that part of the sun which Mr. Dawes
has named the cloudy stratum.

  We have at present no certain knowledge of the true nature of a solar

spot. Telescopic observation would seem to suggest that it consists essen-
tially of the unveiling, by the withdrawal and dissipation of the layer of
bright granules, of that part of the sun which is immediately beneath the

granules, and of which we obtain some glimpses through the pores, which are

always present, and arc of different degrees of blackness.

   The absence of bright lines from the spectrum of the umbra may show
that no considerable part of the light which emanates from the umbra of a

spot is due to luminous gas. This laegative evidence, however, is probably

   F* [The absence of increase in the lines C and may show that the absorption by hydro-

--gen is not materially increased, or it may be caused by the bright lines of prominences

not sufficient to support the conclusion that no part of the light of the umbra
is from such a source. The luminous gas -vrould emit light of the same re-
frangibilitj as some of the dark lines of the solar spectrmn. If these existed
above the same substance in a cooler state, the light might be absorbed, and

the feebler emanations of the still luminous but cooler vapours might not
do more than render less intense the dark gaps produced by the vapours on

the stronger light of all rcfrangibilities which is also present. What may-
be the source of this light we do not know. It is not impossible that the

dense and intensely heated gases which probably form the inner substance of

the sun may in some cases emit lines so greatly expanded as to form, when

numerous spectra are superposed, a sensibly continuous spectrum.- Gases,

when dense, appear to give a continuous spectrum, in addition to that con-

sisting of bright lines.

  --Mars. In a paper presented to the Eoyal Astronomical Society in March

1867*, I gave the results of a further examination of the spectrum of Mars.

In that paper I describe more fully than in my former papers the lines in

the spectrum of this planet, which show the existence of an atmos]3here

similar to that of the earth, though probably not identical with it.

   I give reasons which appear to show that the distinctive ruddy colour of
the planet is not to be attributed to the absorptive properties of its atmo-

--sphere, but to some peculiarity which attaches to certain parts of its surface.
    Neptune. I have several times observed the spectrum of Neptune, but
failed to detect any very marked lines of absorption which might account
for the blue colour of the planet. The faintness of its spectrum does not
permit any great value to be attached to this negative result.

                On Stellar Spectrometry. By Padre SECCHif.

Feafnhofee was the first to analyze with the prism the light of some of the

stars. He discovered in them lines analogous to those Avhich he had dis-
covered in the solar spectrum. Donati, an Italian astronomer now at

Florence, resumed these researches and extended their field. Several astrono-

mers followed, and amongst them the distinguished Mr. Huggins, to whom we

owe a description of the spectra of a great number of stars and the ap-

l^lication of the principle of determining the substances contained in a star

from the black lines of absorption which we see in its spectrum, as was
proposed by Kirchhoff. Mr. Huggins also made the wonderful discovery of

the gaseous state of the nebulae.

    The field opened by these discoveries was immense, and even before the
date of Mr. Huggins's publications 1 tried to glean some ears in it. In the
first stage of these studies the principal stars only were examined, the im-

perfection of my instruments not allowing the examination of all the hea-

venly bodies.

   An optical combination which I had the good fortune to discover, enabled
me to extend the researches to the whole of the visible stars, and even to

several telescopic ones, which i)resent perhaps the greatest mysteries of this

kind.

This optical combination consists of a single prism of that kind which is used

for direct vision, combined with a cylindrical lens. This combination allows

us to employ the full light of the stars, not diminished as in common spec-

troscopes by absorption, or by a sht and the several surfaces and thicknesses

through Avhich the light must pass. The image of the star in this system is

formed in the focus as a luminous line of white colour if there is no prism

and with the prism the image is decomposed into a series of luminous lines

arranged according to their refrangibilities, the interruptions due to the dis-

continuity of the light appealing as black lines.

In such a spectriim the relative position of the lines can be measured with

a common screw-micrometer ; and their absolute position can be determined by

comparison with fundamental stars, whose lines, on account of their in-

tensity, can be fixed in an absolute manner relatively to known substances

by a common slit-spectroscope. The comparison and measurement are

rendered more easy by an improvement introduced in the instrument, by

means of which I can see the direct image of the star together with its spec-

trum. The superposition of this image on a spectral line in a part of the

field of the telescope, marked by a wire, is susceptible of great nicety in

measurement, and gives very accurate results.

   This, in a few words, was the apparatus employed in my researches. This

year I have made a considerable improvement by emploj-ing an eyepiece

made with cylindi'ical lenses only ; with these such an intensity of light is

obtained that I have been able to observe the spectra of stars of the seventh

and eighth magnitudes, which are of course quite invisible to the naked eye.

Let us come now to the results. Many hundred stars of every magnitude

Ato the sixth were passed in review.    catalogue of the" chief of them has

been made, and partly published. The work of the last year, yet impub-

li.shed, has been especially the examination of the red stars of smaller mag-

nitudes, of which a particular research was instituted, but which was

superseded after the reception of the catalogue of Prof. Schjelemp. All

the objects contained in this catalogue (printed also in Chambers's Treatise

on Astronomy) have been examined to the eighth magnitude, beyond which

limit my instrument cannot give a good spectrum.

The principal results and conclusions at which I have arrived are these :

1st. All the stars in relation to their spectrum can be divided into four

groups, for each of which the type of spectrum is quite different.

The first type is represented by the stars Sirius, and Yega or a Lyrae, and

by all the white stars, as a Aquilce, Eegulus, Castor, the large stars in the

Great Bear, a excepted, &c. The spectra of all these stars consist of an

almost imiform prismatic seiies of colours, interrupted only by four very strong

black lines. Of these black lines the one in the red is coincident with the

solar Hue C of Fraunhofer ; another, in the blue, coincides with Fthe line ; the

other two are also in the sun's spectrum, but tliey have no prominent place.

These lines all belong to hydi-ogen gas ; and the coincidence of these four

black lines with those of the gas has been, by careful experiments, ali-eady

proved by Mr. Huggins, and also lately by myself. In a Lyras the coinci-

dence is found to be perfectly aceiu-ate. Mr. Huggins, however, finds a

little difference in the spectrum of Sinus, for which we may account in an-

other way, as I wOl explain presently.

Stars of this first type are very numerous, and embrace almost one-half of

the visible stars of the heavens. "We obsei-ve, however, some difference in

individual stars ; so that in some the lines are broader, and in others nar-

rower ; this may be due to the thickness of the stratum which has been

traversed by the lumi nous rays. The more sivid stars have other very fine

                                                                                  I
                                                                              ;;

                        ON STELLAR SPECTROMETRY.  1G7

lines occasioually visible, but wliich are not characteristic of the tjjie-form.

In this type the red rays are very faint in proportion to the blue, violet, and

green, so that the colour of the star tends to the blue hue, and occasionally

to the green. Of this last kind is the group of the large constellation Orion

and its neighbourhood.

The second type is that of the yeUow stars, as Capella, Pollux, Ai'cturus,

--Aldebai-an, a Ursae Majoris, &c. These stars have a spectrum exactly like

that of our sun that is, distinguished by very iine and numerous lines.

These stars give occasionally a continuous spectrum, when the state of the

atmosj)here is not good ; but in general the lines may be distinguished very

Aeasily.  fuUer descrii^tion is unnecessary, since the spectrum of the sun

is verj- well known. The only thing which deserves j)articular attention is

that in this class occasionally the magnesium lines are veiy strong, so as to

produce very strong bands, and the iron lines in the green are in some very

distinct. These stars can be distinguished even Avithout the prism by the

difference of colour, a rich yellow, which contrasts strongly with that of the

fii'st tyi^e. Stars of this second type are veiy numerous, and embrace almost

the other half of the stars.

The third and very remarkable type is that of orange or reddish stars.

These have as a prototype the stars a Herculis, a Orionis, Antares, o Ceti,

/3 Pegasi. The spectra of these stars show a row of columns at least eight in
niimber, which are formed by strong luminous bands alternating with darker

ones, so arranged as to represent apparently a series of round piUars, closely

resembling a colonnade, a Herculis is exceedingly remarkable in this respect

the other stars are more or less clearlj' divided into pillars ; but it is quite

impossible to describe the beauty of the appearance which is visible in a

telescope on a fine night.

All the pillars are generally resolved more or less completely in different

stars into smaller and finer lines, very sharp and clear. I have carefully

drawn, after actual measurements, the spectrum of a Orionis and a Herci;lis

and in my memoir those of Antares and Aldcbaran are given. In these stars

some of the divisions of the pillars correspond to some principal lines of Fraun-

Dhofer, as and h ; but others, although veiy near, do not coincide with them,

as C and F. The presence of hydrogen, however, is certain, the lines C and

F having been found in the jirincipal of them.
   The divisions of the pillars after many measurements have been found to

agree perfectly in all these stars ; so that this type is very constant and well

marked. In my catalogue 25 of these most interesting objects are registered
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

and I do not imagine that I have exhausted the number.

  A veiy interesting feature connects this type with the preceding one.

Here I must remark that we have to distinguish between lines and bands

of shadow. The lines are strips narrow and sharp, the bands are shaded;

although perhaps each band may be composed of very small lines, the

aspect with our instruments (as at present constructed) is that of a more or less

continuous shade. This shade is analogous to that which is produced by the

vapour of our atmosphere in the spectrum of the sun when it is near the

horizon.

   Now it is a very remarkable fact that these tyijes seem to differ from one

another not in the metallic lines, but in the nebulous bands. Thus, for in-

stance, the spectrum of ^ircturus and Aldcbaran represent the same metallic

lines as a Orionis, but this has bands in addition ; the feature, however, is

altogether so peculiar that a different type must be constituted. It is to be

remarked also that aU the pillars have their luminous sides toward the red,
                                                                        --;

while the shadowed sides are towards the violet ; this ditfereuce is very sub-

stantial, as we shall see presently.

   The fourth tj-pe is not less remarkable. This is the result of a laborious
research on the telescopic stars of a red colour. Some of these are very

small ; and none of them exceed the sixth magnitude. This is the reason

why in ray first memoir I limited the spectra to three types only, being en-

gaged on larger stars only. The spectrum of this tj-po consists of three large

bands of light, which alternate with dark spaces so distributed as to have

the most luminous side towards the violet.

  A very fine prototype of this is seen in the small star of the Great Bear, of
=the position Il.A. 1 2'' 38TM-5, Decl. =46° 15' N. But occasionally there are in

the yellow and red numerous interruptions, which divide these large luminous

= --spaces into smaller ones, as in the stars E.A. =22'' 52TM-5, Decl.  25°51', and
= = AE.A. 6'^ 26"'-0, Decl. 38° 33'.
                                      great part of the red stars of the catalogue

of Lalande, and of that of M. Schjelerup, belong to this or the preceding tyj^e

of tliis last class I have found seventeen remarkable examples. The cha-
racteristic colour here also may be a guide in the research, since some of

these are like drops of blood in the field of the telescope. It is to be noticed

that the line of magnesium b falls almost exactly at the end of the second

luminous band in the green ; but the full aspect of the spectrum does not

justify the presence of such metal, but rather of a gas like carbon, which has

luminous bands corresponding almost to the dark ones of the star, but not

exactly.

    I do not attempt, however, to fix the nature of the substances, since I

have not yet made a sufficient number of comparative measurements ; but it
seems to me that we are authorized in supposing these stars to be still in a

diffei'cnt condition from others, perhajjs partly in the gaseous state, or at least

surrounded by a very large atmosphere different certainly from that of the

others.

The following is a Catalogue of these Stars of the fourth type.
                                                                                                            ;

                                                   ON STELLAR SPECTROMETRY.                             169

The most striking object for its singularity which I have met in this ex-

amination of the heavens, and which is quite nniqne, with the exception of a

very faint companion, is y Cassiopeise. This star showed to me for the first

time the lines of hydrogen in a luminous state, exactly the reverse of the

dark lines of the stars of the first type. The star ft Lyrse has the same fea-

ture, but in a very faint degree.

  We have therefore, without doubt, in. the heavens a grand fact, the fun-

damental distinction between the stars according to a small number of
types ; this opens a field for very many important cosmological speculations.

2. Another grand fact which was brought out from these researches was,

that the stars of the same type are occasionally crowded in the same space
of the heavens. Thus the white stars are thickly gathered in Leo, in Ursa

Major, in Lyra, Pleiades, &c., while the yellow ones are very frequent in

Cetus, in Eridanus, Hydra, &c. The region of Orion is very remarkable for
having all over and in its neighbourhood green stars of the first type, but with
very narrow lines and with scarcely any red colour. It seems that this par-
ticular kind of star is seen through the great mass which constitutes the

great nebula of Orion, whose spectrum may contrast with the primitive

spectrum of the stars. Sirius is perhaps too near us to bo affected by this

influence.

This distribution of stars seems to indicate in space a particular distribu-

tion of matter or of temperature in different regions.

  A3. third very remarkable conclusion arrived at is, that all the spectra

of the third and fourth type belong to variable stars. The representative of

these is the ivonderful star Mira Ceti. This has been carefully examined

and it is found that even when it is only of the seventh magnitude it has

the same typical spectrum, only reduced to its few bright columns, a Orionis

is in the same condition, a Tauri (or Aldebaran) and Arcturus this year

appeared to be smaller and of a more red hue than in the past year ; and in

the first there appeared traces of columns which were not seen the year

before                             so that it  is  evident  that the  change  of these  stars  depends  on  a
                                ;

periodical change which happens in their atmosjiheres.

    It is not so, however, with Algol, which has the very same spectrum of the

first class or type in every stage of magnitude, which induces me to believe

that there the variation is produced by the passage of an opaque body pass-
ing between it and the central star, giving thus an example of eclipse of

a fixed star by its own obscure planet.

4. Pinally, a very dehcate question was proposed by myself, to be resolved

by spectrum analysis ; this consists in ascertaining whether the star has a

proper motion, by the displacement of the lines which ought to take place

in the spectrum owing to the combined motion of the star and the propaga-

tion of light. From this new kind of observation it would be easy to ascer-

tain if a star has a motion whose velocity is five times that of our earth

around the sun. The star a Lyrae, examined in this manner, has not

given any such displacement; >© that it appears not to have such a motion.

In^ some other stars I have found that there is a little displacement, as in

 Ursae Majoris ; but this seems especially due to the different breadth of the

hydrogen line in the star and in the chemical spectrum. I have used in this

investigation the comparison of the direct image of a star with its own spec-

Mytrum, but I have found no appreciable displacement.                                   first researches

of this kind commenced with the supposition that in Sirius there was a per-

fect coincidence of the lines of hydrogen with those of the star. Now I am

told that your distinguished countryman, Mr. Huggins, has found a little dif-
           --;

ference for Sirius. As his experience in making sucli comparisons is greater

than miae, I leave to him the solutioa of this question, satisfied that the first

proposal of this method for determining the proper motion of the stars, which

I made in 1863, has been well received by such a competent judge.

I will conclude with a few words on the nebulee, and especially on that of

Orion. I have the honour to exhibit a drawing of it, made with every care

it is intended to show how far we may see with a single 9^-inch object-glass,

leaving to your gigantic iustruments to penetrate more deeply into these

wonderful objects. I shall only say that on the other side of the galaxy I

have examined several nebulas, and found them to have the same spectrum

Aas d Orionis.      difficulty, however, arose in mj' mind about this subject, which
                           can it be that while hydrogen gas has so fine and rich
-- Howis as follows:

a spectrum, we do not see in the nebulaj anything except the simple hne F?

I undertook, therefore, a Idnd of photomotrical discussion of tlie intensity of
luminosity of the different lines which constitute the spectrum of this sub-

stance ; and the result is that, in diminishing the light by an absorbing screen

and simple reflections, we co.uld reduce the spectrum to a single line F, as we
see it in the nebulaj. Even hydrogen buruiug at the ordinary temperature
has not given any line besides this after reflection. The difficulty is there-

fore comjiletely removed, being only a question of intensity of light.

   Here you see that the matter is not exhausted. "U'e want j-et to make a
more thorough review of oui' discoveries to settle many doubtful points. It is
for the chemical philosopher to resolve some of these difficulties, the astrono-

mer can walk here only with the lamp of chemistiy. We have already had

great satisfaction in seeing quite latelj' that the brilhaney of a comet was due
to the rays of carbon*. Ere long we shall more accurately know what main-
tains light and heat in so many bodies which are scattered in the profundity

of space.

Report on the Physiological Action of the Methyl and allied Compounds.

          By Benjamin W. Richardson, M.A., M.D., F.R.S.

During the past t\velve months, in accordance with the request of the Asso-

ciation, I have continued my researches on the physiological action of the

methyl compounds and their allies. I have had in this research four
objects in view :

   1. To bring into actual practice as remedies some of the substances the
           physiological action of which I had already ascertained, and on which
           1 had previously reported.

   2. To examine further the special mode of action of those bodies of the

     --series which will produce sleep and insensibility to pain the ane-

             sthetics of the series.

   3. To investigate the action of some other bodies of the series, which
           have not as yet been studied by the physiologist, in relation to

              anajsthesia.

   4. To test the antidotal influence of some of the compounds against the

              action of certain active alkaloidal poisons.

   To render the Eeport systematic, I shall place the subject-matter under
the heads above named.

   * The discovery of the lines of carbon was made by the author and communicated to
the French Academy while Mr. Hugging was independently discovering the same thing.
      ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF THE METHYL COMPOUNDS. 171

PART I.--O:^ THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF CERTAIN OF THE

    SUBSTANCES BROUGHT FORWARD OR DESCRIBED IN PRE-

     VIOUS REPORTS.

                                                   Bichloride of Methylene.

   In my last Report I described that the bichloride of methylcDe, CH, Cl,,,

was an excellent anaesthetic substance, and for many reasons preferable to

chloroform. I have since confirmed this view fully by practice. After sub-

jecting myself to the action of the vapour to the i^roduction of perfect insen-

sibility, I ventured to administer it for surgical purposes on the 15th of
October last. The sleep produced was of the deepest and gentlest character,
and the operation, performed by Mr. Spencer Wells, and which lasted 35 mi-

nutes, was quite painless. One trifling difficulty only stood in the way : the
air of the room being warm, and the fluid having a low boiling-point, the

water from the breath of the patient, with which the inhaler was saturated,
became frozen, and was somewhat troublesome to use. This difficulty was

soon met by the invention of a new form of inhaler, exhibited to the Section.

This inhaler answers, not only for the administration of bichloride of methy-
lene, but for all fluids wliich hoil at a low temperature and are useful for in-

halation.

   The iastrument is constructed in such manner that the fluid can be con-
veyed, grain by grain, and distributed in the form of spray on a smface

of thin flannel, spread over a mouthpiece made of vulcanite.

Bichloride of methylene differs from chloroform in action in several parti-

culars. The aujesthetic sleep is produced more quickly, and when produced

is more prolonged. On the other hand, recovery, when it commences, is far

more  rapid                          indeed the    period of  recovery, according  to  my experience,                                                is
                                  ;

never extended over fowc minutes, and there are no prolonged or painful

after-effects.

   "^Tien animals are allowed to sleep to death in vapour of bichloride of
methylene, the lungs are found containing blood, but not congested, while
the heart contains blood on both sides. In this respect the vapour acts dif-
ferently from both chloroform and ether. After death in chloroform-vapour

the lungs are left bloodless, and the right side of the heart gorged with
blood. After death from vapour of ether the lungs are left intensely con-
gested, with the heart containing blood on both sides.

    Bichloride of methylene holds a place between ether and chloroform. It
is safer than chloroform, but not so safe as ether. In matter of efficiency of
action it is equal to chloroform, while it is quicker in action, and more per-
sistent, and far more manageable than ether.

Bichloride of methylene has been largely used by other observers during

the past year. Reports of its employment have reached me from New York^,

Paris, Hanover, and other parts of Germany, from Australia, and from dif-
ferent towns in England. These reports are unexceptionally good, and no

fatal accident has as yet befallen the administration.

There  is,                           however,  as  yet  one   di-awback  to  its  general  introduction                                              I
                                                                                                                                                  ;
mean the difficulty of manufactiuing it on a large scale at a reasonable cost.
It is also, when pure, more difficult to keep than chloroform, its hoihng-point

being at least 33 degrees lower on Fahrenheit's scale (18°-3 C).
The question of the exact composition of the bichloride of methylene has

been recently determined from analysis by one of our best organic chemists,
Mr. Perkin, who has confirmed the composition as C H., Cl^. He has, however'
made a correction of the boiling-point, which he places at 104° F. (40° C.)!
                                                                  ;

172 REPORT--1868.

This is 16° F. (8°-8 C.) higlier than has been given to it by other observers,
as -well as by myself. Quite independently I had also detected this error,
which has arisen, I doubt not, from the jjresence, in the earher specimens of
the fluid, of a little chloride of methyl. I think that even yet there is some
slight cause of error, and that the boiling-point is actually 111° E. (43°-8 C).

   The difficulty of manufacturing bichloride of methylene in sufficient quan-
tities at a reasonable cost is, I repeat, the only objection to its more general
employment. In quantities of two or three ounces the manufacture is easy
but the distillation at a low temperature, which is required, renders the pro-
cess tedious on a large scale, and therefore expensive. The difficulties, I

trust, will in time be overcome.

                         Nitrite of Amtl.

In my first Keport on nitrite of amyl I suggested its employment by in-

halation in cases of acute spasmodic disease, as in tetanus. I reported last

year that the nitrite had, at the instance of Dr. Brunton, been used for the

treatment of one of the most painful spasmodic complaints ; I mean cardiac
apnoea, or, as it was formerly called, angina pectoris. The practice continues
to be followed, and the effect has been remarkable for good : the paroxysm of
angina is often relieved with almost instant action ; and from experience of
the value of this ready means of giving breath to persons whose chests are for a
moment immoveably fixed it is becoming widelj' applied. I have seen myself

the happiest results from this method, and I have therefore given attention to

mythe details of the administration, so as to render it safe. In  last Keport

I mentioned ether as a solvent ; but on testing the solubility of the nitrite
and the solutions which give it up most steadily, I find nothing to answer so
well as absolute alcohol. The best solution is one containing ten parts of the
nitrite in 500 of alcohol. Practically, and for easy remembrance, 50 minims

of the nitrite to 1 fluid ounce of the alcohol may be considered a proper mix-

tiu-e. I exhibited this compound ; and it wiU be found even agreeable as a
flmd for inhalation. In using it not more than two fluid drachms should be
applied at once. The fluid should be poured upon a handkerchief arranged
in the shape of a funnel, or into a funnel of paper, and the vapour should be

inhaled gently.

    I dwell on the necessity of using this dilute alcoholic solution, because the
nitrite of amyl, in its pure state, is one of the most potent of agents. In one
instance, as I have before recorded, a friend of mine, by inhaling it incau-
tiously, nearly destroj-ed himself. It is, in fact, as quick to kill, by the sudden
paralysis of the blood-vessels which it induces, as it is to relieve muscles of

spasm.

   Nitrite of amyl has been used in the later stages of cholera by Dr. Hayden,
of Dublin. I recorded this fact last year at Dundee. Happily we have had
no occasion to test the virtue of the remedy further in this direction during

the past twelve months.

                                            Iodide of Methyl.

   Iodide of methyl, briefly noticed in my last Report, has come into very

important use during the past year. I showed at Dundee that it was an agent
which could be made, by careful inhalation, to produce anaesthesia, but that
it was very difficult to manage in the form of vapour. Its remarkable seda-

tive effect led me to study its influence when administered by the mouth, and

I commenced to learn the dose that could be borne by taldng it myself, in
solution with alcohol. I found that a grain could be taken with perfect
                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

safety. I then prescribed it iu an inveterate case of specific ulceration, in wWch

iodide of potassium had failed, and, carrying the dose up to three grains,
found the most rapid curative result. Further, the great pain and irritability
of the ulcerated surfaces was singularly relieved. Repeating this observation

with further success, I solicited permission of Mr. Nunn to treat some hope-

less cases of canceroiis ulcer in the cancer wards of the Middlesex Hospital.
Four cases were assigned to me, and the suggested plan was carried out by

Mr. Nunn himself. His report of the results, after four months' trial, is of

the most encouraging character. One case of ulceration is reported as healed
so that the patient has left the hospital ; another, in which there was intense
hyjjeraesthesia (extreme sensibility of skin), a symptom which had resisted all
prcAious means, was directly relieved, and the patient has greatly improved.
In a third example pain of an extreme kind was reheved ; and in the fourth

the symptoms remain in abeyance. Mr. Xunn concludes by stating that his

observations show the iodide of methyl can be safely administered for long
periods of time, that it removes pain, particularly that form of pain called

hyperaesthesia, and that cancerous ulceration may heal iinder its use.
He is not, however, prepared to say that it wiU prevent the deposit of

cancer.

   I put before the Section a solution of the iodide as it is ready for use. The
solution contains 6 grains of the iodide in 60° of alcohol. The quantity to
begin with is 10 minims in water. It is agreeable to take.

   The same solution can be administered by inhalation.

PART II.--AN ANALYSIS OF VARIOUS PHENOMENA CONNECTED
    WITH THE ACTION OF CERTAIN OF THE METHYL AND
    ETHYL COMPOUNDS.

There are certain of the compounds of the methyl and ethyl series which

possess the common property of producing sleep and the insensibihty of living

organisms. This general fact seems at first sight to link them all together

and in regard to the one fact they are closely united. But there are, not-

withstanding, points of difference of the most important character. For ex-

ample, they all sometimes kill during their administration, but they are not

all equally powerful to kUl. This alone is sufficient to distinguish them ; and
as from them we derive those agencies by which some hundred thousands

of our kindred are each year relieved of pain with some risk of life, I have

thoiight it of moment to study the differences of phenomena presented by

different agents, so that we may be able to ajiproach to a knowledge of first

principles, and seize all the real good, with avoidance of what at this moment

appears an inevitable degree of evil.

As it was impossible to investigate all the bodies of the sex-ies, I confined

my research to a few representatives only                                                                                                                                                                                and, indeed, what has been ga-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

thered in this way is too long to be recorded in anything but abstract.

        Physical Changes of Blood xiroduced hy different Methyl and Ethyl
                                                    Compounds.

   "When a man or an inferior animal is subjected to one of the ordinary

anaesthetics, great difference is observed iu the change of colour of the
blood, the difference itself being determined by the class of agent that is
being used. Under the influence of all the chlorides, of both the methyl and
ethyl series, the blood retains its bright-red colour on the arterial side, while
on the venous side the colour is slightly heightened. Under the influence of
the oxides of the methyl and ethyl series the reverse obtains ; the arterial

is natural.

   When these fluids arc added to blood freslily drawn, tbese same changes

are also observed, together with a difference in the jjeriod of coagulation, the
process of coag-ulation being quickened by the chlorides, and slightly retarded
by the oxides. In the blood of some animals, such as the sheep and the

common fowl, the period of natiual coagulation is so rapid that the difference

is not easily computed ; but the blood of the ox, which at the temperature of
60° F. (15-''"5 C.) coagulates normally in three minutes, shows the fact clearly,
ten per cent, of chloroform quickening the coagulation a full minute and a
half, while the same proportion of ether delays it an interval of two minutes

beyond the normal period.

Wlien the different agents are added to defiibrinatcd fresh blood in the

proportion of five per cent., the most striking differences are observed in
respect to colour, fluidity, change in the corpuscles, and development of

blood-crystals. In investigating these changes, I siibjected equal q^iantities of

freshly defibrinated sheep's blood to representatives of the methyl and ethyl

series, and set them aside for observation during a period of thirty-five days.

They were examined careliiUy on the first and thirty-fifth day, as wcU as on

intervening days, by my friend Dr. Sedgwick, who was so good as to relieve

me greatly of this labour, and who has condensed the record of the changes

--as they were observed to occur stage by stage in the course of the inquiry.
   Bichloride of McthyJene. On addition of the bichloride of methylene to

blood, the colour was rendered bright and full red ; and this colour was main-

tained until the thirty-fifth day. The blood remained fluid throughout. The

red corpitscles commenced to dissolve on the first day, and by the thirty-fifth

day scarcely a corpuscle was left.  Blood- crystals were at no time developed
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

                                    Influence on the Circulation and Respiration.

I have studied as a special point the influence of certain of the ethyls and

methyls, with a view to determine the all-important subject of their relative

--action, upon the respiration and the circulation. On this point there has been

long- controversy the most accepted rule being that chloroform always kills

by paralyzing the heart, while ether is free from that danger. It must be

confessed that at fii'st sight this view seems to be in accordance with the

general facts of observation ; but a long and careful watching, in which ex-

periment succeeds experiment, leads in time to this certain truth, that

chloroform does not always kill by paralyzing the heart, but that with chlo-

roform, as with ether, the heart wiU continue to beat after the respii-ation

has ceased. The rule, therefore, is not general ; the question is how far it

is at aU true.

To test this, I proceeded first to see whether the heart could be sustained

in its action while respu-ation, with an atmosphere containing a narcotizing

dose of chloroform, was artificially supplied. I found in this experiment no

Adifficulty whatever, and no remaining doubt after it. "J"-shaped tube hav-

ing been inserted into the trachea of a strong animal (a dog) narcotized with
vapour of chloroform, the animal was made still to breathe air charged with

the vapour, in steadily increasing dose, until some change occurred. During

this time, in the deadest silence from aU other motions, the sounds of the

heart were listened to, with the double stethoscope, by myself, while an
assistant watched for the cessation of respiration. " The respiration stops "

was the report ; but I could stiU hear, not only the motion of the heart, but

both the sounds in due order of time. Then the first soimd began to fail,
and soon the second. At this moment, on a signal from me, artificial respi-

ration, with the same chloroform atmosphere in which the animal had gone

to sleep, was set up by means of double-acting bellows ; and at once, as the

air filled the lung, the blood made its way again through the heart, the

motion of the heart returned, the sounds returned, and the general signs of

life returned. Once more the experiment was tried, and once again with the

saine result ; and so decided was the experiment that, on giving it fresh air

artificially, the animal recovered, in the end, as from simple sleep.

In a further instance I repeated the famous experiment first performed by

Hook, with the difi'erence that the animal throughout was held insensible by

chloroform. In this case, after insensibility was complete, and respiration,

which for some minutes had been carried on through the tracheal tube, had

ceased, the heart was directly exposed to view, together with the lungs. The

heart was pulsating vigorously on both sides, the lungs generally were

blanched, from the blood ceasing to make its way by the pulmonary circuit:

but artificial respii-atiou of the chloroform atmosphere was reestablished ; and

as the lungs filled with the air the right side of the heart was set at liberty,

the blood passed over the pulmonary circuit, and on withdrawing the chloro-

form, and for a brief period suj^plying the air pure, the general signs of life

began to rGajipear. They were, of course, suppressed by repeating the chlo-

roform                         but  before  the  heart was  finally stopped  in its  action,  the  fact  of being
                            ;

able to call it again into play by reinducing respiration was several times

demonstrated.

   Taking a very important practical hint from Dr. M'Intosh, who read an

admirable paper at Dundee before this Section, I followed up my research

by watching the circulation and respiration in young transparent trout
while they were being subjected to the action of methyl and ethyl com-
pounds. I was so fortunate at the close of last year as to be able to obtain
176 REPORT--1868.

young trout iu quantity, and so sccm'o a very goocl inquir}\ I hoped at first

to be able to see the motion of the heart on a screen, by placing the animals

in a trough in the oxyhydrogeu lantern ; and I have to thank Mr. Pepper

and the Managers of tlio Royal Polytechnic Institution very heartily for

myplacing their very perfect optical chamber at  service.  I could not, how-

ever, carry out in this way all T desii'ed ; for when the figure of the animal

was projected on the screen, there were no visible movements except those

of respiration. I therefore turned to the microscope, and fotmd here all I

could require. To carry out m)- plan properly, Dr. Sedgwick was so good

as to devise for me a little trough, in which the trout could be placed for

observation, and through which water charged with the required compound

could be passed in a steady stream. This plan prevented the accumulation of

carbonic acid ; and when no foreign substance was introduced into the cur-

rent, the circulation and respiration of the fish could be observed for long-

periods natiu'allj'.

Thus provided, three substances from one series were made to act upon

the trout, viz. chloroform, ether, and chloride of methyl. The observations

were most interesting, but to give them in detail would be too long ; I shall
therefore only offer the results in an abstract, which Dr. Sedgwick, who had
the observations daily before him for several weeks, has been good enough to
draw out for me.

   When chloroform is added to the water in which the young trout is living,

in amount sufficient to destroy life in half a minute, the heart ceases acting

at once, stops in diastole, full of blood. The gill and blood respiratory

routine continue some little time afterwards. No contraction of extreme

vessels is noticeable for some time after death. If the chloroform be added

in smaller quantities, the first effect is violent sti'uggling, which by degrees

--subsides. The respiration is at first much quickened, then becomes slower,

and finally ceases that is, so far as the gill, fin, and jaw motion is con-

cerned. The heart at first beats quickly, then slowly, after a time intermits,
and then totally ceases to act. No contractions of minute vessels could be

observed under a power of 600 diameters. Not one of these fishes recovered

from the narcotism of chloroform after the rcsjnratoiy movements had ceased.
With chloride-of-methyl gas in water, on the other hand, and also with

ethylic ether, recovery was observed after all external respiratory movements

had ceased, even for fifteen minutes, the heart beating all the time, but very

slowly, the contractions reduced from 246 to 15 in a minute. The ijheno-
mena observable in these animals when narcotized with chloride of methyl

is in other respects like those which occur irnder the use of chloroform, the

notable points being the cessation of respiratory movements before the cir-
culatory, and the absence of any definite contraction of the small vessels when

the agents are administered in quantities not sufficient to produce immediate

death.

These experiments prove, I think, beyond cavil, that the chlorides of the

methyl scries do not of necessity destroy life by their direct action upon the
heart. Indeed they indicate rather that when the heart itself is sound,

and the chloride is let into the system by the process of inhalation, the heart

is not primarily interfered with. It was therefore all-important to learn

whether the heart could be primarily arrested by making it the primary

recipient of the narcotic.

   To test this, a large animal was selected, and a twenty-minim dose of

chloroform was slowly instilled, by one of Mr. Hunter's syringes for sub-

cutaneous injection, into a large vein in the ear. Within a few seconds

                                                           i

(indeed as soon as the last rniuini was injected) the animal was convulsed and
dead. As quickly as the operation, with every appliance at hand, could be

performed, the thorax was laid open, and the lungs and heart exposed. The
heart on both sides was found firmly contracted on firmly clotted blood
which filled its cavities. The lungs were intensely congested with blood,

also firmly coagulated, so that they cut like substance of liver ; the brain

was quite natural. Excited by the galvanic current, the muscles of respira-

tion and the voluntary muscles responded well for an hour, but the heart

could be roused to no sign of motion.

   Here, then, we had a proof that chloroform carried directly to the heart
may stop the heart primarily. In this sense, however, it does not act by

paralyzing, in the ordinary sense of that word, but by exciting a vigorous

contraction, prolonged to the death.

   By injecting chloroform through the aorta over the whole body of an

animal just dead, I saw the same sudden and permanent contraction univer-
sally developed in the muscular system.

    The conclusions I have up to this time arrived at in respect to the action

of chloroform and all the other chlorides of the methyl and ethyl series, are :--

1. That when these are administered by inhalation to healthy bodies, their first

action, as they diff'use through the different organs, is exerted directly on the
muscles, which they call into powerful contraction. 2. That this action,
extendmg further to the arterial muscular system, suspends the influx of

blood, generally leading, in return, to relaxation of the common muscles, and

to arrest of cerebral function. 3. That the heart, if its coronary canals
and its walls he good, lives through the catastrophe better than any other

structure, and, in short, is the organ on whose power the ultimate recovery
rests. 4. That death from chloroform in the healthy animal is due to faihng

respiratory power, and, above all, to contraction of the pulmonary artery, by
which the current of blood from the right to the left side is p-evented.

   This view, in respect to animals, associates all the phenomena in death
from chloroform; it accounts for the stage of muscular excijement, the ces-

sation of the beat of the pulse while the heart is still beating, the continu-

ance of the action of the heart when the respiration has stopped, and the

white and bloodless condition in which the lungs are invariably discovered

when death is complete.

This same view tallies moreover with aU the known facts respecting sudden
death under the influence of the chlorides in cases where the heart is not

healthy, where, unable to live through the preliminary excitement into
which, with tbe other muscles, it is thrown, it ceases action altogether--ceases
for the same reason that it ceased in the animal when the narcotic was thrown
Adirect into it, I mean because it is overcome by the excitation to which it is
subjected.  little want of elasticity in the coronary arteries, an undue ten-

mdency to contraction in them, a deficiency of muscular substance, an intersti-

tial deposit the muscle,--any one of these conditions is amply sufficient to
account for death from the heart under the influence of the exciting chlo-ides.
Under the action of the oxides of methyl and ethyl the living body avoids

these dangers to a degree as yet little understood. These from the first pro-
dace very ht tie excitabihty of the muscular mechanism ; and when they ulti-
mately kiU, the act is not by contraction of vessels, but by slow asphyxia, the
gradual extinction of oxidation from the exclusion of air.

Hence, after death by ether, the lungs are not found blanched, but con-

gested, the heart still active, the muscles flaccid, and the blood in all the
tissues dark in colour.

                     Influence on the Animal Temperature.

A subject of mucli importance seemed to me to be open for inquiry in

respect to the conditions of the finimal temperatui-e under the action of those

methyl and ethyl compounds which produce temporary inseusibihty. At-

tempts had already been made by myself and others to determine the order
of facts from the human subject. But the circumstances under which the

narcotizing agents are administered to human kind are so peculiar that

no separate observer could conduct a satisfactory research in a sufficient

number of cases to be reliable. To arrive at correct data, a period of three

mhours at least is required for each observation ; the air of the room which

the observation  is  made must be  kept at a steady and     uniform heat                                           three
                                                                                                                ;

observers are also wanted, and the utmost quiet must prevail, that excite-
ment of an external character do not move or annoy the subject. To meet

these necessities, I determined to conduct the research on inferior animals.

I selected from two kinds of animals,--the guiueapig, whose temperature is

not more than two degrees above man, and the pigeon, an animal which has

a mean temperature fuU ten degrees above that of man. I next selected
chloroform and ether as the two agents to be tested ; it was necessary, from

the labour and time demanded, not to take more than two substances, and

these I considered were fair representatives of two distinct series, while at

the same time they were substances with which the world of science generally

is most familiar.       of being   most  ably  assisted in  observation                              by my
   I had the pleasure

friends Dr. F. Versmann and Dr. Sedgwick, with Mr. Alfred Nutt occasionally,

and Mr. Alfred Haviland ; in every case another pair of eyes besides my own

kept strict watch. The thermometers uf.ed were by Casella. The plan of

proceeding was first to bring the air of the laboratory to a fixed temperature,
the mean of 54° Fahr. being carefully sustained. In this air the animal was
allowed to live for two hours before the observation, and the natural tempe-

mrature of the animal was carcfuUy noted--in the pigeon from the cloaca,

the guineapig from the rectum.

   The animals were put to sleep by being made gently to inhale the vapours
to which they were subjected from a mask covered with thin flannel, and the
thermometer was watched and registered through every stage of narcotism,

and for one hour or more after recovery.

  mIn one pigeon the observation was conducted three separate times,

another pigeon twice, and in five other pigeons once. In one guineapig the

mobservation was made three times, in another twice, and five others once.

   The phenomena were amongst the most uniform I have ever recorded in

experiment.

  m mIn the pigeons subjected to chloroform there was
                                                                                                                         .,

                                                         every case a tall the

thermometer, during the narcotism, of from G^-5 to 0° Fahr. Tins was so
singularly correct that the result actually varied with tlie natural tempe-
ratures of the birds. Thus in one of the birds, in which the natural tempe-
mrature was 107°-5,
                     the thermometer came  down  regularly  to 101°                             while
                                                                                             ;

another bird, the natural temperature of which was ll(t°, the thermometer

regularly feU to 104°.

This decline in temperature did not date from the actual commencemeiit

of inhalation.   For the fii'st stage the thermometer remained  steady                                             as the
                                                                                                  ;

third stage became more determined, and the foui-th approached, the decline

impending death, viz. feeble breathing, intermittent pulse, and complete
muscular relaxation. At this extreme recovery yvas permitted. The tem-

fell again to 107°'7. After this the temperature rose to 108°, and remained
there, the animal seeming entirely -well.

    In a further short scries of experiments the influence of cold during
narcotism from ether-vapour was tested. The temperature of a pigeon
having been reduced by narcotic action of ether from 107° to 104°, the sjjray
of ether was directed upon the head luitil the superficies of the cerebrum
were solidified. Under these combined influences the temperature of the body

ran down as low as 97°"7. At this point of extreme reduction of heat there
occiirred a severe tremor ; but on restoi'ing warmth, the recovery was steady
and good, the natural heat being back in ten hours.

    In a similar experiment made with chloroform-vapour, the results were
the same within a little less than a degree. The reduction of temperature
was from 107°'5 to 98°-5. The recovery was good.

    One other experiment deserves notice, for the accident attending it. In

administering chloroform to a rabbit having a temperature of 102°, the
thermometer, during a sharp paroxysm of muscular excitement, rose at one

move to 103°-8, or nearly two degrees. At the moment the heart ceased to
pulsate, and the animal was dead. The occurrence is entirely in character
with what has often happened in the human subject under chloroform. The

heart involved in the sudden muscular excitement has contracted spasmo-
dically, and the motion of life has ceased for good.

    I ought almost to apologize for relating these facts on the temperature of

animals under chloroform and ether with so much minuteness ; but practical
physiologists, who wiU at once see their bearing, will pardon me. The facts
we have gathered are :

    (a) That during tlie stage of the muscular excitement incident to the cir-
        culation of chloroform through the body there is a temporary increment

          of heat.

    (h) That with the cessation of the muscular motion there is a gradual

          decrease of heat.

    (c) That the decrease of temperature is greatly accelerated and intensified
        by the act of vomiting.

    (d) That coincidently with the minimum of reduced animal temperature

        there is intermittent action of the heart and the extreme of muscular

           prostration.

                                                          Comj^ounds.

    The observations already recorded led me to make a further inquiry in

 jrespect to the influence of the galvanic current at different stages of nar-

 cotism. In this research chloroform was the only narcotic used, and pigeons
 were the subjects of experiment.

     In the first experiment, the animal having been subjected to the vapour
 of chloroform until the development of the stage of excitement, and the con-
 sequent increase of temperature, a needle connected with one pole of an elec-
 tro-magnetic machine was passed through the skin of the neck, while a
 second needle was passed through the leg. The free end of the second pole
 was next brought to the needle in the leg, and a moderate current was passed
 through the bodj'. In an instant the muscular over-action was converted into
 general rigidity, the chest was fixed, the lieart was fixed, and death was the
 immediate result.

     In the next experiment, the same arrangements for the transmission of
 the current having been made as before, and the same strength of current
      ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF THE METHYL COMPOUNDS. 181

being used, the other details were changed. The animal was allowed

to pass through the stage of muscular excitement into the third stage of
musciilar relaxation. This stage reached, the current was transmitted
through the body of the animal. The eifect, again instantaneous, was not

to destroy life, but to excite all the phenomena of apparent active life. The
wings were moved as in the act of flight, motions attended with progressive
or propulsive action were strongly marked, the breathing was quickened, the
impulse of the heart was increased, and the temperature rose ; but when the
current was withdrawn all these striking phenomena were withdrawn also,
and the animal again slept inactive and prostrate, but ready to recover.

   Eor the sake of comparison another experiment of a similar character was
carried out, in which, instead of reducing the animal body by the administra-
tion of chloroform, the spray of ether was directed upon the cerebrum until
the phenomena of entire unconsciousness and of muscular prostration were
fuUy pronounced. Then the current from the coil was j^assed through the
body as before, with the temporary development of the phenomena of mus-

cular activity.

   The lessons taught by these experiments are in confirmation of aU that
has gone before. They prove how distinct a double action on the muscular
organs is exerted by chloroform, and they indicate an independency of in-
fluence upon the muscular and nervous systems, between insensibility, or I
had better say unconsciousness, and deficiency of motor power, which I was

not myself, previous to the experiments, prepared to recognize. It is clear

that in the narcotism induced by chloroform, and perhaps by all other similar

agents, the muscles can be called into action while the brain is vii'tually dead;

we can, in short, supply the muscles with an artificial nervous energy.

         Bangers attending administration of Methyl or Etliyl Compounds.

    E,ecasting these experiments and putting the various facts in order, I have
been led to consider from them the dangers which waylay the administrators
of the methyl and ethyl compounds, the causes of these dangers, and the

way to avoid them.

 --And here, I think, is a primary truth, the basis of progress in the discovery

of new agents : that the danger in anaesthesia does not lie in the produc-

tion of sleep, nor even of deep sleep, but in the production, in the course of
the process, of symptoms which, although the prime sources of danger, are not
connected by any necessity with the aufesthesia. I refer especially to the

symptoms of muscular excitement and rigidity, followed, as we have seen,
by decrease of temperature of the animal.

   Again, I think there is another truth hardly secondary, viz. that we

already possess agents which by their action prove to us their power of pro-
ducing antesthesia without exciting muscivlar rigidity, and without materially

disturbing the animal temperature. If this be true, we ought as men of

science to exclude at once from the list of safe anaesthetics all such as on
experiment are found to produce rigidity of muscle or vomiting (which is
an indication of the same action), and reduction of heat by its transference

into motion at a moment when the conditions for the liberation of force are

most unfavourable.

   The exclusion here named would, I conceive, of itself save many lives, and

would bring the danger of artificially induced sleep to the danger, and no
more, of mere natural sleep. The only cause of accident would be in carry-
ing the insensibility to the extreme of extinguishing life, an accident for
which the administrator would be clearly culpable, and which, even now,
                                                                             ;

when very dangerous agents are in daily use, has never, as far as I know,

happened.

   In searching for the agents we require, we must begin by exchiding bad

ones, which is, in fact, to exclude whole classes. The class of the clilorides,

under this rule, would aU go. It is true they are not all equally dangerous,

and that the increase of danger is in proportion to the substitution of chlo-

rine ; but, as a class, they one and aU do more than we require, they produce

muscular rigidity, vomiting, and decrease of animal heat. This same rule holds

good in relation to the iodides and the bromides. Supposing, then, we keep to
the methyl and ethyl series as bases, we are driven back to the oxides, to what
are commonly the ethers, for our agents. None of these which have yet been

applied have been actually perfect ; but it is almost certain that in course of

time the chemist will produce for the physiologist the precise requirement.

That it may be generally known what this requirement is, I will state in a

few sentences the theoretical formula of a safe anaesthetic, an ansesthetic
that shall be applicable to long and short operations ahke, and shall become
acceptable generally from its readiness and safety.

   1. It must be a fluid. Gases, however good, are not practicable as agents
for general and daily use ; more than this, as at the temperature of the blood
they remain as gases, and when dissolved in blood they exert no action from
change of form in the organism. To narcotize with them it is consequently

necessary to give them in large quantities, even it may be to the exclusion

of air altogether. The influence of a gas thus administered is of necessity
limited to the briefest interval of time ; steady continuance would lead to

certain death from asphyxia.
   2. The fluid must possess homogeny and stability. Mixtures of fluids are

utterly unreliable. Fluids which easily decompose under the infliience of

heat or of light are unreliable.

   3. The fluid must be of pleasant odour, and must produce no irritation
when inhaled or when applied to the skin. All the fluids which, like chloro-
form, amylene, and turpentine, cause redness and irritation of skin, cause
also, when introduced into the blood, irritability of muscle and rigidity, toge-

ther with vomiting.
   4. The boiling-point of the fluid should be not less than 110° Fahr., and

not over 130^. Fluids which pass into vapour below the temperature of the
animal body act practically as gases, and must be used in free quantities to

the exclusion of air ; common ether, amylene, and bichloride of methylene have

this fault, the last least. Fluids, on the other hand, which pass altogether
into vapour at a point much above the animal temperature, as at 140° or
upwards, condense in the pulmonary blood too determinately, and although

tliey create a long sleep, they remain for a considerable period in the body,

creating continued nausea and depression from interference with the conser-

vation of the animal heat. Chloroform, tetrachloride of carbon, and common

Aalcohol are objectionable on these grounds.  fluid which should have a

boiling-point some 20° above the body, and other properties equally good to

commend it, would be convenient in every respect. It could be easily preserved,
and as an anaesthetic it would be alike applicable to long and short operations.

5. The density of the vapour of the fluid should be about 40, taking

hydrogen as unity.

   In the large Table before the Section I have named a list of substances
(23 in all), which have received from me the most careful investigation
tliey arc all wanting in some jiroperty that is essential, but one or two new

observations respecting the action of certain of them are worthy of notice.
ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF THE METHYL COMPOUNDS. 183

--On Methylic Ether in Ethi/Jio Ether. To obtain a very quickly acting and

Asafe anaesthetic fluid I saturated common ether with methylic ether.                                                                                 very

agreeable but, of coui'se, unstable fluid was iu this way obtained. After nar-

cotizing several animals with this compound, I allowed my friends Dr. Sedg-
wick and Mr. Marshall to subject me to it on the 20th of May of this year.

The vapour caused no irritation, and I was, I learn from Dr. Sedgwick's

note, "well off" in one mimite, the pulse rising from 70 to 96. At first the

respiration was slightly sobbing, two or, three rapid inspirations being fol-

lowed by two or three similar expirations. There was no change of colour in

the face, and no coldness. After being insensible for seventy seconds, I

awoke sufiiciently to speak to my friends, but I do not remember the circum-

stance, and I am reported to have fallen off quietly to sleep again, after moving

from the chair in which I was sitting to a couch, on which I lay down.

Here I slept very quietly, with easy breathing, for at least two minutes, and

then I awoke with slight sobbing, followed by a violent and irrepressible fit

of laiighter. Recovery was rapid, indeed instantaneovis, after this, and was

unattended    by any  one                                          disagreeable     symptom                                            there was  no  vomiting,  no

nausea,  no headache                                               indeed in  five  minutes  I  was following                                     my occupations
                                                                ;

as if nothing had interfered with them.

In order to see the extreme effect of methylic ether, I allowed a guinea-

pig, when profoundly narcotized, to remain in an atmosphere holding 15 per

cent, of the gas. The animal continued to breathe easily for nine minutes in

this atmosphere, then the breathing became irregular, and at fourteen

minutes it stopped. I now removed the animal into pure air at 75°, and on

examining the heart I found that organ beating steadilj^, and with the sounds

most distinct. I continued to watch for restoration of breathing, and four

miniites and twenty-three seconds afterwards observed a slight movement of

breathmg ; in two or three seconds more these movements were repeated, in

another minute there were sixteen inspirations in forty-five seconds, and the

animal in the end recovered rapidly and soundlj', with nothing worse than

a slight shivering. In this experiment tlierc was the longest complete sus-

pension of respiration in a warm-blooded animal I have ever seen, followed

by recovery.

In a further series of experiments I allowed pigeons, rabbits, and guinea-

pigs to sleep to death in methylic ether. In all cases the respiration ceased

before the heart stopped its rhythmical pulsation, and in every case there

was found after death slight congestion of the lungs, blood on both sides of

the heart, and blood on the arterial side darkened in colour. In no case did

spasmodic action precede death.

   In recording the phenomena induced by the inhalation of methylic ether,

we cannot but be struck with an analogous action between it and nitrous

oxide or laughing-gas. Like nitrous oxide it acts quickly, and its effects

quickly pass away, but it does not produce the same degree of asphyxia, and
it acts when freely diluted with air.

                                                  Methtlal.

   Another substance which promised to be a good agent was methylal. The
composition of methylal is Q^ H, 0^ ; its specific gravity is 0-855, and its
vapour density is 38. It was made for me by Dr. E. \ ersmann. It is made
by distilling methylic alcohol and sulphuric acid with peroxide of manganese.
It is a clear fluid, boiling at 108° F., and having a sweet ethereal odour. It
is soluble in water as well as in ether and alcohol.

   In the vapour of methylal animals pass into s^.eep gently and slowly with

Whenperfect insensibility. The peculiaritj' of action is slowness.  the sleep

has been produced, it lasts a considerable period, and is undisturbed, but

the respiration is slow and heavy. There is no marked excitement and no

vomiting. If the action were less prolonged, methylal would rank amojigst

the best of anaesthetics. It is a very agreeable vapour to inhale.

                                            FOEMIATE OF ElHTt.

   The last agent which I tested was the formiate of ethyl. The composition
of the formiate is C^H^ 0,, the boiling-point 130°, the vapour- density 37°.
It is made by distilling alcohol with formic acid. In the vapoiu- of this
substance animals fall into a stupor, but do not actually sleep. They have
considerable muscular excitement, and vomiting is easily excited. The
vajwur is also irritating to the throat and to the air-passages of the lung.

   Mj' chief object in testing the formiate of ethyl was to compare its action
with that of the acetate of methyl, with which it is isomeric. The action of
the two is different ; the acetate produces deep stupor without muscular ex-

citement.

Ox THE Neutralization of some Poisoks bt the Hethtj, and EiiriL Series.

   The last line of research to which I shaU refer in this Eeport relates to the
employment of the members of the methj-1 and ethjd scries for the purpose
of neutralizing alkaloidal poisons. Trom the fact that iodide of potassium
and iodide of methyl produce very definite curative effects in some forms of

disease, it occurred to me that possibly they underwent change of constitution
in the body, forming, vrith a foreign and injurious agent, a new compound,

   This view was confirmed by an observation made some years ago while con-
ducting experiments on the synthesis of cataract. I found then, and recorded

the fact in Brown-Sequa-d's journal in 1860, that while chloride of potassium
and chloride of sodium would ^U'oduce a synthesis of cataract, the correspond-
ing iodide salts would not. Hence I concluded that the iodides, even in
organisms so low as frogs, were decomposed. The question, therefore, came
before me, whether the iodides would neutralize in the organism the action

of some of the better known poisons of the allcaloidal typo.
   To test this the following research was made ; it dated from the 24th of

October last year, 1867.
    Three solutions were prepared. One consisted of 2 minims of iodide of

ethyl, mixed with 30 of water. Tivo consisted of 30 minims of water and
alcohol, holding the J^, of a grain of strychnia. Three consisted of -J^ of a
grain of strychnia with 2 miuims of iodide of ethyl and 30 of alcohol and

water.

   A frog was injected with the solution number 1. It became tetanic in

one minute and a half. Another frog was injected with the solution num-

ber 3, i. e. the solution of strycliuia and iodide of ethyl. This frog also be-
came tetanic in one minute and a half.

   The frog number 1 was Jiow injected Avith a solution containing 5 minims of
the iodide of ethyl ; within ten minutes the spontaneous tetanus had ceased,
and spasm produced under the influence of ii'ritation was very much less. In
twenty minutes there was entire relaxation, but with faint twitches when the
skin was touched.

    The frog number 2 was next injected with a solution containing 1 minim
of iodide of ethyl. There was immediate relaxation of the tetanic spasm, and
irritation brought on no spasm.

frog 2 remained relaxed and living, bnt paralyzed. Eotli frogs died on the
following day, retaining their symptoms to the end.

   It was clear in these two cases that the iodide of ethyl exerted an anti-

dotal action to the poison, hut as the animals died with ditferent classes of
symptoms, a further research was made.

  A large frog was injected with 10 minims of the iodide simply. It seemed

quite unatfcctcd for some hours, but on the following day it cUcd, presenting
symptoms of general paralysis similar to the frog that had received the
five-minim injection after the strychnia. Thus the question had to be solved

whether any precise formula of neutralization could he arrived at. In one
experiment I had not used enough iodide to overcome the spasm, in another

I had thrown in so much of the iodide as to more than neutralize, and, in
fact, to kill by the iodide itself. Can, then, any known quantities for exact

neutralization be arrived at in a living body ?

    I believe they can, but up to this time I have failed, after the most careful

study, to find the quantitj-. I can certainly prolong life twenty-four and

even twenty-eight hoiu-s after a terribly intense dose of stryclmia, but ulti-

mately there is death.

   Iodide of methyl acts in precisely a similar way as the iodide of ethyl, as

do also the bromides of methyl and ethyl.
    Another series of experiments were at the same time made with nicotin.

On October the 26th, 1867, two minims of nicotin were injected subcu-

taneously into a large rabbit. The animal died in twenty-five seconds.

   A second rabbit was injected with two minims of nicotin and two of iodide

 of ethyl. It died also in twenty-five seconds.

   A third rabbit was injected with one minim of nicotin and ten of the

iodide. It died in one minute and fifty-one seconds.

   A guineapig and a rabbit were treated with ten minims of the iodide

 only. They remained well for several hours, but both died next day.
    Again, varied experiments were carried out to get at the neutralizing pro-

portions of these two agents, and guineapigs were mnde to replace the rab-
bits ; but the point was never reached. The effect of a large dose of nicotin
was modified, i. e. the convulsive action was prevented, but in the end there
was death.

   In my Ileport at the Meeting at Birmingham, I suggested that possibly it

would be practicable to make new chemical compounds, siibstitution-com-
 pounds, in the living body. While I have been thinking and trying to work
 out this idea, Drs. Eraser and Crum Brown have been conducting the most

 singularly beautiful series of research bearing on the same question, but
 carried on differently. These experimentalists have shown conclusively that
 an intensely poisonous dose of strychnia can be rendered inert by first con-

 verting the aUcaloid into a methyl-iodide.

    This is a wonderful advance. But the question remains, can the same
 thing be done within the living body ? Can a new chemical compound be

produced there ? When we consider the circumstances under which the sub-
 stitution-compounds are made in the laboratory, I confess I am liardly pre-
pared to see that they can be formed in the body. On the other hand, we
 have now evidence that to a certain extent iodide of methyl and ethyl are

 directly antidotal to strychnia or nicotin.

     In the body, however, there are two distinct actions to be considered, the
 physiological action and the chemical. The antidotal efifects of the methyl-
 iodide might, therefore, be due, not to chemical union or substitution, but to

 physiological neutralization.
186 KEPORT--1868.-

    To ajiproach. a conclusion on this particular point I moved from the
iodides altogether, and from the mouocarbon series altogether, and repeated
some experiments, which I had commenced as early as 1864, with various
nitrites of the bodies of which carbon is the base. I began w4th nitrite
of amyl, passed to nitrite of ethyl, and next to the nitrite and nitrate of
methyl. The results are rich in interest ; for each one of these substances

proves to be singularly antidotal to the acute action of strychnia. So re-
markably is this true in respect to nitrite of amyl, that in a frog tetanized

with strychnia I was able to hold back every convulsion for three days by
the simple experiment of keeping the animal on a bed of moist moss, cove-
ring it with a beU-jar, and by introducing into the jar two minims of the
nitrite every eight hours on a strip of paper.

    But here came the singular fact, and in different degrees it was seen in
all the other experiments ; so soon as the bell-jar was removed, and the
antidote was able to escape from the body of the animal, the strychnine
tetanus retm'ned. In one case, however, by great care in the experiment,
a slightly tetanized frog was kept long enough under the nitrite to allow
the effects of the tetanic poison to cease, and this animal recovered.

    These truths are so convincing that I can have no hesitation in confirming
another suggestion I made at the Birmingham Meeting, for the careful em-
ployment of the nitrite of amyl, by inhalation, in the treatment of tetanus

in the human subject. The remedy can be inhaled from the alcoholic sohition
which I have already placed before the Section, and it may be applied, imder

cautious or, rather, careful administration, whenever there is spasmodic
paroxysm.

   But what is the action ? I do not think there can be any doubt on the
point in the case of the nitrites. It is clear that the action is purely phy-
siological, because when the antidote is not rencAved the action of the

strychnine returns. I am bound at this moment to confine myself to the

strict narration of this fact, without applying it by inference to the iodides,

bromides, or other bodies of the organic scries. Next year, after a new
course of experimental research, I shall, I trust, be able to show the posses-

sion of some more definite knowledge on the subject.
   I conclude. It is not a practice of mine to trespass beyond due hounds

on the patience of an audience, a7id if on this occasion I may appear to

have broken a wholesome rule, I really cannot apologize. The subject I

--have had to treat goes to the root of principle in the study of means for

the cure I am bold to say the cure, by true and certain scientific methods,
of the diseases which most severely scourge the human family and many of

the lower families in the scale of living organization.
   Gradually, but surely as gradually, the curer of bodies will learn from tlie

chemist and the practical physiologist that his remedies, rapid in action, easy
in administration, positive in result, must all come from the organic com-
pounds, wnich are of themselves a part of the organic nature.

   Thus learned, the physician will exchange dogmatism for wisdom, faith

for knowledge, and doubt for certainty. He will compete " ,ith his fellows

by the pure struggle of intellect ; he wiU be responsible for results without
evasion, and his duties will be more solemnly his own ; but he will stand,
where he never stood before, a conscious master in his art ; he will know in
what he doth believe, and the world, assured by his exactitude, wiU soon
learn to know none but him in his vocation.
ON THE ACTION OF MERCURY ON THE BILIARY SECRETION. 187

Report of the Edinburgh Committee on the Action of Mercury on the

   Biliary Secretion. By J. Hughes Bennett^ M.D., F.R.S.E.,

    Chairman and Reporter.

At the Meeting of the Association in Dundee (1867), I read as a communica-

tiou some of the results arrived at by a Committee which had been in-

vestigating the action of mercury as a cholagogue. The inqxiiry originated

in a suggestion made by myself, in the annual address in medicine I delivered

to the British Medical Association at Chester in 1866. The physioloo-ical

Ddepartment of Section considered the results so interesting and important

that a grant of money was voted in aid of the Committee's researches, with

the understanding that a full report was to be made on the whole inquiry

at the next Meeting of the Association to be held in Norwich. The Com-

mittee consisted of Dr. Hughes Bennett, Professor of the Institutes of Medic-ne

and Physiology in the University of Edinbiu-gh, the Chairman and Reporter,

Dr. Christison, Professor of Materia Medica, Dr. Maclagan, Professor of

Medical Jurisprudence, Dr. James Rogers, formerly of St. Petersburg, Dr.

"W. Rutherford, assistant to the Professor of Physiology, Dr. Gamgee,

assistant to the Professor of Medical Jurisprudence, and Dr. Fraser, assistant

to the Professor of Materia Medica, Edinburgh.

The first meeting of the Committee was held JSTovember 16th, 1866. On

proceeding to consider by what method the action of mercury on the biliary se-
cretion was to be accurately ascertained, the conclusion was arrived at that no

kind of examination of the fseees could yield trustworthy results. Supposing

that the chief and characteristic constituents of the bUe found their way into

the alvine evacuations unchanged, imperfection in the analytical methods at

our disposal render their quantitative analysis impossible. The plan of

ascertaining bUe-acids indirectly by means of nitrogen and sulphur determina-

tions of the alcoholic extract, while most unsatisfactory in the case of ]iure

bile, is still more so when applied to the alcobolic extract of fieces. The
method of Professor Hoppe-Seyler of Tubingen, who calculated the amount

of bile-acids from the effect which their solutions exert upon the ray of

polarized light, presents such complexity and difficulty as to render its
systematic employment in any series of analyses altogether inapplicable. As

to the colouring-matters of bile, there is no direct method known by which
they can be estimated. But it was further argued that, did we even possess
proper means of estimating the bile-products, it is only a small portion of
such as are secreted by the hver which can be found in the alvine discharges.

Bidder and Schmidt ascertained that the amount of unoxidized sulphur in
them only represented one-eighth part of the total sulphur which the liver
secretes, and that of the other constituents of the bile the larger proportion

are absorbed. Indeed the utter impossibility of detecting the constituents

of bile in the faeces is admitted by one of the most reliable physiological chemists

of Europe, viz. Professor Hoppe-Seyler. That under the influence of purga-

tives unchanged bile is occasionally discharged  from  the bowel                                                                               is  true                      but
                                                                                                                                                                          ;

this furnishes no proof of any increase  of that secretion                                                                                     for under ordinary
                                                                                                                                            ;

circumstances it is decomposed and absorbed in the alimentary canal, and

any cause which increases the rapidity of its passage there, must render ab-

sorption and decomposition less complete.

   As it was evident that no accurate information concerning the amount of
bile secreted by the liver was to be obtained by an examination of the faeces,
the Committee arrived at the conclusion that the formation of biliary fistul^

the gall-bladder, Tvas the only means open to them of determining how far

mercury influenced that secretion.

HlSTOEY.

It next became necessary to ascertain -what had been made out by prerious

observers as to the amount of bile secreted by the liver, under varied cir-

cumstances, through biliary fistula;. For hterary researches into this matter,

the Committee are greatly indebted to Dr. Rogers. He informs the Com-

mittee, in his rejjort on this branch of the inquiry, that efforts to establish

mthbiliary fistulse and to collect the bile have been attended  exti'cme

diflSculty in the hands of all experimenters, and have led to a large mortality

among the animals operated on. Of 18 dogs operated on for this purpose by

Professor Schwann of Louvain, 10 died within a week after the operation,

from its immediate effects ; six in from eight to eighty days from inanition,

although the appetite remained good. In 2, the choledic diet was rees-

tablished. Some years afterwards he operated on 12 other dogs, so that

the total number operated on amounted to 30 ; and Bidder and Schmidt

inform us that of these one lived four months, and another a whole year,

after the operation. The last-mentioned authors say*, " "VYe shall not take

into account the unsuccessful cases, of which the number at the commence-

ment of our investigation of this subject was not very small." Again, thej

say, "After ten or twelve unsuccessful attempts to establish permanent

biliary fistulas in cats, we were obliged to have recourse to dogs." Dr. Flint,
in his paper on a New Function of the Liver, does not mention the number

of dogs on which he performed the operation ; but it is evident that a great

number perished. He says, " All the experiments made during the winter

1860-61 were unsuccessful, no animal surviving the operation more than

three days." After a number of trials during the following winter, which

were not more successful than the in'cvious ones, he succeeded at last with

one animal. There is every reason to believe that, had other experimenters

informed us of their failures, the number of these wouldhave been equally great.

In the few eases which have succeeded, however, it is important to remember

that a large amount of valuable information regarding the bile has been ob-

tained that never would have been arrived at without them.

The operation performed by physiologists on animals in order to establish

biliary fistulffi has, with a few modifications, been essentially the same, and

will be subsequently de'scribed when detailing the experiments of the Com-

mittee.

 --The results arrived at may be divided into : 1, the amount of the

biliary secretion in health, and the circumstances which influence it ; 2, the
special effect of mercuiy on the secretion of bile.

 --HALLERf. In Haller's ' Physiology,' reference is given to several cases in

which attempts had been made to ascertain the quantity of bile secreted in a
given time by experiments on living dogs. The description of them, however,
is so very vague and general that they possess little interest for the phy-
siologists of the present day. Yan Eeverhord found the quantity of bile se-
creted by a dog in twenty-four hours to be 6 oz. ; and Haller, estimating the
secretion in the human subject at four times that in the dog, suggested 24 oz.

to be the quantity secreted daily in the healthy human adult. He likewise
alludes to an interesting case of a man in whom a biliary fistula was formed
in consequence of a wound of the gall-bladder. Tacconus, who saw the case,

estimated the amount of bile discharged by the fistula at 4 02. ; but whether
the expression "eodem tempore" refers to six or twenty-four houi-s, it is

impossible to say probably to the former.

 -- --ScuwANN*. It was not till 1844 that any serioiis attempts were made to

investigate this subject by Professor Schwann of Louvain. He made several

interesting experiments, by means of biliary fistidae, to ascertain the utiUty
of bile in the animal economy. Unfortunately he does not appear to have

--carried out his intention of ascertaining accurately its amount.
    BLOXDLOTt. In 1846 Blondlot succeeded in establishing a biliary fistula
in a dog of middle size, in which he gives approximately 40 to 50 grammes
as the amount of bile secreted in twenty-four hours. His estimate, however,
was not made with great precision ; for he only collected the fluid for short
periods at a time, and coiild not therefore ascertain its exact amount in twenty-

--four hours.
    H. NasseJ. Heinrich Nasse of Marburg published in 1851 an in-
teresting memoir giving an account of a series of experiments performed on
one dog in Avhich a biliary fistula had been established, and which lived
afterwards five months and a half. His object was to ascertain the influence
of the quantity and quality of the food on the biliary secretion. As we have

not succeeded in obtaining the original work, the result of his researches will
be subsequently tabulated as obtained from the abstract given of them in

--Canstatt§.
    Bidder and ScnMiDT||. In 1852, Bidder and Schmidt, in their work on
 the Digestive Pluids, gave an account of the most elaborate experiments yet
 made to determine the amount of the biliary secretion. They succeeded in
 estabhshiug biliary fistulaj in foux dogs. In one dog the daily observations
 extended from Feb. 17th to April 15th, when he was killed. The bile was
 collected by holchng a balloon-shaped glass over the fistulous opening for
 fifteen minutes at a time ; and this was repeated daily from six to ten times
 successively. The varying amount of biliary secretion obtained at one period
 was corrected by the results obtained at other periods, and the average amount
 calculated from a large number of observations. This method, though
 excellent for determining the amount of the secretion at difl'erent periods of

 the digestive process, is, as regards the daily quantity, evidently iinsatisfactory.

 Besides, as the dog did not consume the same amount of food under these
 varied circumstances, that might vitiate the result. To simplify the Tables,
 and render calculation easier, they estimated the amount of bile secreted at
 so much per kilogramme weight of dog. Thus, if a dog weighing 5 kilo-
 grammes secreted 100 grammes of bile in twenty-four hours, it would be
 said that 20 grammes of bile were secreted for each kilogramme of dog in
 twenty-four hours. They estimate the average amount of bile per kilogramme

 in twenty-four hours at 19-999.

     The following Table gives the average amount of biliary secretion in the
 four dogs, with the average amount of food per kilogramme taken hourly and
 daily. One Idlogramme weight of dog gives 6 grammes.

first or second hour after feeding, the other so much the earlier the more

scanty the supply of food.
    In Bidder and Schmidt's tabulated observations on the first dog, it will be

seen that the greatest amount of fresh bile was secreted between six and
seven hours after a meal. It is true that the greater amount of dry biliary
residue was found in one of the collections made from fourteen and a half to
fifteen and a half hours after feeding ; but in another quantity collected at
the same period after feeding the amount both of fresh bile and dry residue
was miich less than that coU.cted between six and seven hours after a meal.
Again, of two quantities collected respectively on the 2 id and 6th of Novem-
ber, from fourteen to fifteen and a haM hours after feeding, the amount of
fresh bile in the fii'st collection was only about the half of what was secreted
from three to four hours after a meal ; and in the second collection it was
about half of that secreted from four and a half to five and a half hours after
a meal. The tabulated observations on the third dog seem to give mo-e
support to Bidder and Schmidt's opinion ; but quantities of biliary secretion

given for dift'erent periods after feeding are too fluctuating to permit the

amount of bUe secreted at any given stage of digestion to be accurately
estimated. The observations of Bidder and Schmidt themselves, therefore,
do not support their own conclusion ; and as this is opposed to those of
other experimenters, it must be concluded that the amount of bile secreted
varies considerably in the same animal, and at the same period of digestion,
even independently of food and drink.

  --Arnold*. In 1854 Dr. Arnold pviblished a work on the ' Physiology of

the Bile,' and afterwards made some additional experiments on the subject in
1857. The apparatus he employed consisted of a canula 4| centimetres long
and 4 centimetres wide, attached by a screw to an elastic caoutchouc bag 10
centimetres long and 1 centimetre broad. Fifteen millimetres above this
attachment, and at right angles with the canula, was a metallic plate, 12
millimetres in diameter. This plate was placed between the skin and the
muscles ; and the wound healed perfectly over it, preventing all escape of bile
between the soft parts and the canula. The distal extremity of the bag had
a cork stopper, by taking out which the bile collected in it could be removed.
The operation was performed in the usual manner on a healthy dog of middle
size, weighing 9-250 kilogrammes, on the 18th of June, 1853. The common
duct was first tied close to the duodenum, and again half an inch from the
gut. The portion between the two ligatures was then excised. Although
after the operation the dog was exhausted, and vomited its food more than
once, on the following day he appeared to be quite well. The bile flowed
freely through the canula until July 1st, when it ceased. Anol,her and
wider canula, with a broader border, was then inserted. This also, sub-
sequently, was so forced forwards by the cout'action of the wound that no
bile could flow, and the canida was withdrawn. The apparatus fii-st in-
serted was then employed, and answered perfectly, as the canula was firmly
fixed in its place by the wound healing over it ; so that not a drop of bile
escaped at its edges. From the 1 8th of June until the 6th of July, the dog
wasted on bread, milk, flesh, and potatoes. It lost 375 grammes in weight
during this period, without any perceptible derangement of digestion. The
ffeces were pultoceous, without any trace of bUe-pigment, had a putrid
odoiu", and contained a considerable quantity of fat, but no trace of mascular
fibre. To prevent him from licking the bile he was muzzled. From July
6th to August 2nd he was fed entirely on flesh. From the 6th to the 9th

of July he ate daily 500 grammes of fat flesh. During this period the fteces

·were like clay, soft, and contained a quantity of fat. The weight of the

body diminished rapidlj*, so that on the Sth it was 8-203 kilogrammes, and

on the 9th 7' 750 kilogTammcs. He was then lean, but lively, and had 750

grammes of flesh, pretty free from fat, divided into three portions, which he

ate morning, midday, and evening. During the period he lived on flesh his

hair fell out largely, and could easily be pulled out in tufts without causing

pain. There was also a large development of gas in tlie intestines, Mith

borborygmi and liquid faeces. About the 20th of July they assumed their

natural consistence, and were brown externally, though of an ash-colour in-

ternally. Each time the fistulous opening was interfered with or irritated,

the faeces became softer and more liquid, and their odour more cadaverous
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

while, when consistent, it was less penetratingly putrid. From August 3rd

to September 1st, the food consisted of old rye-bread, of which there was

consumed, on an average, daily 470 grammes, and was commenced because

the dog refused all animal food. During this period its weight increased to

8 kilogrammes, the emaciation disappeared, and the falling off of the hair

diminished. Indeed the hair in a few mouths grew abundantly, so that it

presented a black shining coat, as before the operation. The appetite re-

turned, and he ate greedily. The digestion was good ; the fieces of firm

consistence, of a yellowish-grey colour, like that of the bread, and less offen-

sive than when he was fed on flesh. Their quantity also was increased as

throe to two.  Their average daily weight was 320 grammes                                                                                                                                                                                         whereas, when
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

fed on flesh, it was 210 grammes. He also drank more. When the diet was

bread, he drank daily the average quantity of 450 cubic centimetres ; when

fed on flesh, only 340 cubic centimetres.

fistula!, iu cousequeuce of the increased diet they require, no conclusion can
he drawn as to the quantity of bile likely to be secreted in healthy dogs
iu proportion to the amount of food they take. 4. The quantity of bile
secreted in proportion to the weight of the animal is estimated too highly
by Bidder and Schmidt, and also by ISTasse ; because all animals with

biliary fistula) retjuire much more than their ordinary food to keep up their
usual weight, while the quantity of diet influences the amount of bile

secreted. 5. Besides food, the drinking of water considerably increases the

secretion of bile. 0. The nature of the food does not much influence the

solid constituents of bile. Arnold admits, however, that in this respect

Basse's observations may be more accurate than his own. 7. The secretion

of bile, apart from the influence that it exerts on the absorption of fat, plays
an important part in the process of nutrition. 8. In Arnold's dog the biliary
secretion was most copious during the first hours after taking food. After

the fourth hour it began to diminish until the twenty-fourth hour, when it
was least, but the diminution was not regular. His manner of collecting it.

however, like that of Bidder and Schmidt, is objectionable, viz. at varying
periods of fifteen minutes, half an hour, and an hour. Instead, therefore, of

determining how much bile flowed in twenty-four hours, this was made to
appear by multiplying so many times the half-hour or hour collections.

   KoLLiKEE and Mitllee* made some experiments on the bile during the years
1853 and 1854, of which they published an account in the "Wurzburg Ab-
handlungen for 1855. They succeeded in establishing biliary fistula) in

--three dogs. For one kilogramme of dog, they found in twenty-four hours

           Hours after food.

 --Dalton*. Dr. Dalton of Nc-^v York attempted to ascertain the amount of

bile whicli passed into the duodenum from the choledic duct by means of a
duodeual fistiila. But as in this manucr it is obviously impossible to deter-
mine the amount of the entire quantity given off by the liver, no account of

--his researches need be given.
   Flint f. The last experimenter we need cite is Dr. Flint of New York.

As his object, however, was rather to ascertain the amount of cholesterine
secreted by the liver, than to determine the quantity of biliary secretion, he
does not g'ive us much information on this point. In one dog the bile was
collected for thirty minutes at a time during various periods of the day, and

was found to be secreted at its maximum four hours, and at its minimum

twenty hours, after feeding. The dog weighed 10 pounds ; and there were
collected, in the twenty-four hours, 243-233 grains--an amount which gives

an index of the quantity secreted during that period. He further says that,
disregarding slight variations, which might be accidental, it may be stated in
general terms that the maximum flow of bile from the liver is from the

second to the eighth hour after feeding, during which period of time it is

about stationary.

   We here subjoin a Table containing the results of the experiments of

different physiologists who have investigated the subject of the biliary secre-

tion. "With the exception of the results of those of Dr. Flint and Dr. Scott,
the Table, of which the arrangement is slightly changed, is taken from
Canstatt's Jahresbericht for the year 1863, No. 1. p. 141. The weight is

                                                     the Biliary Secretion.

   --Nasse*. Professor H. ]!^asse was the first who attempted to ascertain, bj'

   experiment oa the dog with biliary fistula, the influence of mercury on the

   secretion of bile. It is stated in Canstatt that the result of his experiments
   was that calomel increased the absolute quantity of the bile, but diminished

   its solid constituents.

      KoLLiKEE and Muller administered to one of their dogs, which had biliary

  fistula, 4 grains of calomel at ten o'clock on the morning of the 2Sth. Pive

  lialf-hour observations made after midday gave an average of 3-823 grammes

  of bile excreted, an amount a little above that of previous a-s-erages. On the

 --following day, however, four half-hour observations gave on an average

  3-267 grammes, that is, rather less than the usual average.

     On the 21st and 29th days the dog took again 4 grains of calomel, but the

  biliary secretion, instead of increasing, diminished. Seven observations of
  half an hour each, from the 2Sth to the 31st day, gave an average of only
  2-183 grammes, and the bile at the same time was of a brownish colour, and

  so thick that at last it scarcely dropped from the canula. This circumstance
  was undoubtedly owing to the dog's health, which was bad. It had lost
  weight, had diarrhoea, greyish- coloured and oven later bloody stools. For

  several days at this period the animal took only a little bread and milk.

     Dr. MosLERt, in his investigations, proposed to himself the question,

 " What substances introduced into the blood appear in the bile ? " In some

 of the experiments a solution of the substance to be tried was injected into
 the blood, in others the medicine was given by the mouth, and the bile

 afterwards tested, to ascertain if it contained any trace of the substance ad-
 ministered. With regard to mercury, he teUs us that on the 23rd of May,
 at seven o'clock a.m., 5 grains of calomel in a little bread and milk were

 given to a dog, who had a completely healed biliary fistula. AB. the bile
 secreted till three o'clock p.m. was collected by means of a sponge and tested
 for mercury, but }iot the slightest trace of it could be discovered. At four
 o'clock P.M. 10 grains of calomel were administered to the same animal, and for
 greater accuracy a small tube with a caoutchouc bag attached was introduced
into the fistula, and kept there till next morning. No trace of mercury was

found in the collected bile, and no striking increase of the biliary secretion
 was remarked. After this experiment the animal was dull, ate less than
usual, and had thin very oifensive stools. To make a trial of the drug in
smaller doses. Dr. Mosler gave the same animal one grain of calomel every
hour from the 2.5th to the 26 th of May, so that altogether 25 grains of
calomel were given ; no trace of mercury could be found in the collected
bile. To another powerful dog with biliary fistula he gave, on the 19th of
August, at_ nine o'clock, three pills, each containing 3 grains of calomel.
Kext morning at six o'clock a.m., three similar pills were given, and at nine

o'clock two more-- so that the dog had 30 grains of calomel in eighteen hours.

The bile discharged from the fistula was carefully collected by a sponge,
from three o'clock on August 11th till the same" hour on .August 12th.'
Compared with the quantity collected during twent}--four hours on the day
previous to that of the experiment, there was no striking increase of bile,

nor did it contain any trace of mercury. He repeated this experiment with

24 grains of calomel with the same negative result. Dr. Mosler concludes

the bile passed during these experiments, which would have given far more

value and precision to his observations.
   gcoTT.^The only other experiments made to determine the influence of

mercurial preparations or, rather, of calomel on the biliary secretion with

which we are acquainted are those of Dr. Scott, who deserves great credit
for the careful and scientific manner in which he has carried them out.

We shall have occasion, however, to indicate some circumstances which

seem clearly to show that they must be regarded rather as valuable contri-
butions to aid us in determining the influence of calomel on the biliary
secretion than as data which, of themselves, warrant any definite conclusion
indeed Dr. Scott himself has fully admitted the truth of this remark. Dr.
Scott made four trials -with calomel, in which he estimated the amount of
increase of the biliary secretion by taking the average of two days previous

and of two days subsequent to its administration.
    In the first trial 3 grains of calomel were given to the dog at three o'clock

P.M. on the 13th of June*. The daily average amount of bile secreted on
the 11th and 13th of June was 1960 grains, and that of bile secreted on
the 14th and loth, 1358 grains, showing an average diminution of 602
grains for each of the two days subsequent to the administration of the

calomel.

    In the second trial 6 grains of calomel were administered at eleven o'clock
A.M. on the 16th of Juncf. The amount of bile secreted during twenty-four
hours, and collected on the morning of the 16th, was 1639 grains, and of
that secreted during the subsequent twenty-four hours, and collected on the
17th of June, was 518 grains, indicating a diminution of 1121 grains in the
 biliary secretion during twenty-four hours after the administration of the

 calomel.

     In the third trial 12 grains of calomel were given at 4.30 p.m. on the
 3rd of July, the average daily secretion of bile for two previous days (2nd
 and 3rd of July) amounting to 3044 grahis, and that for the two subsequent
 days (4th and 5th of July) to 2720 grains, showing a diminution of 324
 grains on the average daily quantity of bile secreted after the administration

 of the calomel.

     In the last trial 12 grains of calomel were given at 5.45 p.m. on July 7th ;
 the daily average amount of biliary secretion on the two preceding days (the
 6th and 7th) being 2658 grains, and on the 8th and 9th July being 1724
 grains, showing a diminution of 934 grains in the daily average quantity of

 bile secreted after the administration of the calomel.

     AVe subjoin a Table of the daily amount of fresh bUe collected for several

 days, in order that our subsequent remarks may be intelligible to the reader.

 The " t " before the dates iudicates the days on which calomel was ad-

  ministered.

    * The bile secreted during twenty-four Lours was always collected on the morning of
the day indicated. Tlie amount obtained on June 12th was not used in calculating an

average, as a considerable quantity was lost in collecting it.
   t The amount of bile collected on the 1.5th was not used in making an average, pro-

bably because Dr. Scott supposed the secretion of the previous twenty-four hours was still

under the influence of the calomel.

Dr. Scott concluded that all the trials gave but one result, viz, " a dimi-

nution in the amount of bile and bile solids secreted after the administration

Weof large doses of calomel."            are of opinion, ho-wever, that the diminution

is not nearly so groat as he has made it appear ; thus, for example, if in the
first trial we set aside the results of June 12th (as Dr. Scott has done), and

only take the amount of bile secreted during the t-vrenty-four hours previous

and subsequent to the administration of calomel (as Dr. Scott has done in

the second trial), the amount of decrease will be considerably less than he

has calculated it to be.

Again, if we take the average amount of bile collected during two days

pre^-ious and two days subsequent to the administration of the second dose

of calomel, the result will be very different from what Dr. Scott's calcula-

tions make it. Instead of a diminution of 1121 grains, it will amount only

to 104 grains ; and we must not overlook the fact that on the day when the

calomel was administered the dog did not get any food.

Dr. Scott does not mention at what hour of the morning the bile was

collected. If we suppose it was collected at 10 o'clock a.m., twenty-three

hours would thus be left for the action of the calomel, which was ad-

ministered at 11 o'clock A.M. on the preceding day. It might be said that

the action of the calomel would not be exhausted in that time, and that we

ought not, therefore, to admit the collection of bile of the loth into the cal-

culation for obtaining a daily average amount on the two days previous to the

administration of the calomel. On June ISth, however, the second day after

the second administration of calomel, the amount of biliary secretion increased

from 518 grains on the 17th to 1810 grains on the 18th, 171 grains more

than the quantity secreted on the 16th, a day on wliich calomel could not

have had any influence on the amount. Consequently we must conclude

that the influence of the calomel did not extend, in this case, to the second

day after its administration ; or, if it did, it was not to diminish, but to in-

crease very largely the secretion. Up to the present time we know little or

nothing of the duration of the action of a dose of calomel on the biliary secre-

tion                 so that we have no  reason to assign a  period  of two days, ratlier than
                  ;

of one or of three, as the duration of its action. It would be to ascribe in

the one case an increase and in the other a diminution to the same cause

that is, the action of the mercury on the second day after its administration.

In short, the number of Dr. Scott's observations are far too few, and not

sufficiently long continued, to allow us to draw any definite conclusions

fi-om them.

   It miist, I think, be evident, from this notice of all that has been previously
accomplished, that no exact information has yet been obtained as to the in-

fluence of mercury on the secretion of bile, or as to any other action it may

exercise on the liver.

     Description op the Mode of operating for BniARr Fistul^e and of

                     COLLECTING THE BiLE PRACTISED BY THE COMMITTEE.

   All the operations were performed by Dr. W. Eutherford, who ultimately

succeeded in overcoming the great difficulties which presented themselves.
The propriety of collecting the bUe for a period of at least twenty-four hours
at a time was considered incumbent to avoid error, a proceeding which caused
great trouble and constant failures ; it was considered necessary, however,
in order to avoid the obvious fallacies into which all previous experimenters,

with the exception of Dr. Scott, had fallen. In now giving a detailed de-

scription of the method followed, the Committee are of opinion that they
wlU save future experimenters much of that trouble and mortification which,
from want of experience, they themselves encountered. It will be regarded
as more valuable in consequence of the modifications Avhich have been intro-
duced having led to a far greater amount of success than has attended the

efforts of other physiologists.

1. Operation for estahlisldng Biliary Fistulas.

1. Place the animal under the influence of chloroform, taking care to

administer it slowly with an abundant admixtiu'c of air.
   2. Open the peritoneal cavity by an incision extending from the xiphoid

cartilage to the umbiHcus. Before opening the peritoneum, all bleeding

should be stopped.

   3. Make an incision through a non-vascular part of the omentum, to the

same extent as the external wound.

4. Find the gall-bladder and seize the most prominent part of its fundus

with artery forceps. See if the fundus can be brought to the linea alba

without subjecting it to any tension. If it can, proceed with the operation.

If it cannot, judging from the experience of the Committee, it is better to

abandon the operation altogether, as the dragging of the gall-bladder will

almost certainly give rise to peritonitis, or such irritation as will prevent ad-

hesion of the fundus to the cut edges of the linea alba.

5. Find the common bile-duct ; draw the duodenum gently downwards and

towards the left side of the animal, and the liver upwards and to the right, so

as to stretch the duct.

6. "With a blunt-poi]itcd bistoiuy make an incision about one-eighth of an

inch in length along the duct about its middle                                                                                                                                                                                   gently isolate  it with the point
                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

of an aneurism needle, pass the aneurism needle with a double strong silk

ligature round the duct, and tie it in two places, at a suflscieut distance from

each other to allow of the duct being simply divided between them. After

division of the duct cut the ligatures close.

7. Observe at what part of the hnea alba the fundus can be most easily

retained. Pass a curved needle with a silk ligature through the skin, linea

alba, and gaU-bladdcr on either side of the fundus, so as to stitch the gall-

bladder to the linea alba, and retain it there.

8. Make a slit by means of a sharp-pointed bistoury in the most prominent

part of the fundus, and allow the bile to flow out, taking care to hold a sponge

at the side of the opening to prevent, as much as possible, the entrance of bile

into the peritoneal cavity. With the same view, the animal should be turned

on its side before the opening is made in the gall-bladder. This opening

should be just large enough to admit easily a piece of india-rubber tubing about

     9. Introduce a portion of india-rubber tubing of the above calibre into the
 apertiu-e in the gall-bladder, put a silk suture through it, and fasten it to the

ligatures holding the fundus to the linea alba, in order that the tube may be

 kept from coming out.

    10. Close the wound in the abdomen by interrupted sutures, placed deeply
 in the hnea alba, and then connect the edges of the skin in the same way.
 The skin should not be closed completely around the tube, but should be left
 open for an inch or so, in order that blood may be prevented from accumulating.

    11. The projecting extremity of the tube should be cut within a quarter of
 an inch from the abdominal wall, in order that when the dog lies on its face

there may be less danger of closing the tube by its being bent upon itself.

    .12. The tube should be removed at the end of forty-eight hours or so, for
 then adhesions will in most cases have taken place between the gaU-bladder
 and linca alba, which the continued pressure of the tube would only tend to
break up. The dogs operated upon by the Committee were never kept
muzzled after the operation, and no dog ever interfered with the elastic tube.

    13. The operation should always be performed when the stomach is empty,
for if distended it is a most serious impediment to the operator. Very soft

sponges, perfectly freed from all sandy particles, should be used, and the
greatest care should be taken to prevent hairs from getting inside the peri-
toneum.

    14. In male dogs the urine is apt to be discharged into the wound during
the operation, and against this the operator must carefully be on his guard.

     15. Great care should be taken to prevent bleeding into the peritoneal

cavity. Any accumulation of blood inside the abdomen gives rise almost

certainly to ])eritonitis. In aU cases a little bile escaped into the peritoneum,
but it seemed to produce no inji;rious effect.

    16. The ligatures around the common bile-duct usually become eucj'sted.
The wound almost always heals by first intention ; this union is very rarely
permanent in the cutaneous wound, however ; commonly pus is formed be-

tween the skin and the wound in the linea alba. When such is the case,

sutures must be removed from the cutaneous wound to give free exit to the
purulent matter. No lotions or other dressings are necessary for the wound.
The bile as it flows over it forms au excellent dressing, under which healthy

granulation proceeds, in most cases with rapidity.
    17. Por two days after the operation the animal should be fed on milk,

given in small quantities at a time, so that the abdomen may not be distended.

    The above mode of performing the operation differs from those described

--by other operators in two particulars : 1. The mode of fixing the fundus of

the gall-bladder to the abdominal wall. Bernard recommends a clamp to fix
the fundus to the edges of the wound, and act as a canula also. 2. In the
non-removal of any portion of the common bile-duct. Other operators re-
commend that two ligatures be applied to the common duct, one close to the
duodenum, the other close to the junction of the cystic Mith the hepatic duct,
and that the intervening portion should be excised. The object is to prevent
as much as possible the reestablishment of the duct, a contingency which
appears to have been very liable to occur in the experience of other observers.
The shock produced by cleaning and removing the whole duct is very great,
owing to the extensive injury of the sympathetic nerves ; and the danger from
hoDmorrhage is most serious.

   Since the removal of any portion of the common bUe-duct has been aban-

doned, the success attending the operations of the Committee has been un-
precedented. In only two out of the thirty-three dogs operated on has the

common bile-duct become rccstablisbcd ; in one of tbese nearly tlic whole duct

had been excised, in the other the duct had simply been divided between the
two ligatures.

    The experience of the Committee has shown that young dogs arc not suitable
for the operation, only fidl-c/rcwn stronr/ good-tempered dogs of any breed

should be selected. Had the Committee been aware of this precaution, their

success as regards the number of useful fistulse might have been greater even

than it has been.

                                         2. MetJwcl of collecting the Bile.

    The collection of the bile maj' be begun usually Avithin a fortnight after

the operation, as soon indeed as the fistula can bear the daily pressure of a
 silver canula. Before its insertion into the fistula, it is well to wait until

the whole of the wound except the fistulous opening is completely healed.
During the healing process, the fistula must be kept patent by the daily
passage of a glass rod, which serves admirably the purpose of a bougie ; for

 notwithstanding the flovr of the bile, the canal has a great tendency to close.

    The great difficulty which the Committee have had to overcome, has been
the daily collection of bile for a period of twenty-four hours. The following-
apparatus, devised by Drs. Euthcrford and (iamgee, has been found to accom-
plish the end perfectly.

    The canula iised was that of Scott (Beale's Archives, vol. i. p. 210), with
the cup removed, and the holes in the tube filled up. The Committee found
 that in the very first case in which they used Scott's canula, the cup failed
 to fit the skin accurately, and soon produced ulceration by its pressure.
 They have found that there is no need for providing for an escape of bile

 along the side of the canula, provided ix perfectly free exit be allowed throucfh

 it. The canula was retained in the fistula by elastic bands attached to it,
 and passed round the body of the dog. These bands were fastened to each
 other by hook^^ and eyes, which permit of their easy removal and adjustment.
 Scott collected the bile in a bottle. It appeared to the Committee that an
 clastic bag tied on the free end of the canula would be less apt to be damaged
 by the movements of the animal. They found, however, that a much more
 satisfactory method is to collect the bile flowing from the canula by means of

--a large sponge. In this way no nsistance is oft'ered to the flow of bile through

 the canula such as is apt to occur when the bag is UFcd, by its folding over
 the free end of the tube. This acted as a valve, which resisted the feeble

 pressure with v,-hich the bile flowed tlirough the fistula.
     The sponge was placed in a tin box, fixed round an oval opening on the

 abdominal aspect of a thick gutta-percha shield, which extended from the
 fore legs to a little behind the umbilicus. The shield was made to fit accu-
 rately the body, so that it might have no tendency to turn round when the
 animal lay down. It embraced three-fourths of the circumference of the body,
 and the one side of it was connected M'itli the other over the animal's back by
 means of leather straps with buckles. Between the back and these, a soft
 leather saddle was placed to prevent ulceration by their pressure. With the
 same view a flat bag filled with air was placed between the shield and the
  sternum, and a piece of thick-walled india-rubber tubing an inch or so in
  diameter, was placed between the skin and the posterior part of the shield.
  To this the bag and tube were both immoveably fixed.

     The shield tends to slip backwards, owing to the pyramidal shape of the
  body of the animal. To prevent this, a leather collar must be placed loosely
  round the neck, and the anterior edge of the shield fixed to it by thick twine

or leather straps with buckles. If the dog be a male, means must be taken
to prevent the urine from reaching the sponge. This is effectually done by a
sheet of thin india-rubber, laced round the posterior part of the shield and

body in front of the penis, so as fairly to prevent the access of a single drop
of urine. The Avhole apparatus was removed, washed and reapplied once
in the twenty-four hours. The sponge was then weighed and placed in the
shield dry. At the end of the period it Avas removed and weighed again, to

ascertain the amount of bile. Two sponges are necessary for observations on
a single dog, each sponge used on alternate days. They must be cleaned,

after the collection of bile, with great care. It was found best to wash them
in dilute hydrochloric acid, in order that they might be thoroughlydisinfected,

for putrid matter soon produces decomposition of the bile.

   The shield should be firmly secured on the animal to prevent its being
moved. The Committee have in only one instance found it necessary to muzzle
a dog while it wore the apparatus.

   The dogs were kept in large cages, the lower half of the sides and entire
floor of which consisted of sheet zinc. Th(! floor sloped to a central hole,
through AA'hich the urine was collected. The dogs were mostly taken out to
the open air for a few hours daily.

                                                   Meecurt.

   The Committee had not proceeded far with their experiments, before it
became evident that a preliminary investigation was necessary, in order to
determine how far dogs are capable of being influenced by mercurials. Al-

though in veterinary and other works it is admitted that this animal may

be salivated, although Overbeck states that by means of frictions with mer-
curial ointment he succeeded in producing marked salivation with spongy gums
in three dogs out of five *, and Murray in his experiments with large doses of
calomel also produced salivation in one dog t, the Committee were of opinion
that further careful observations should be made on this j^oint.

   Accordingly great pains were taken by Dr. Gamgee to produce salivation in
two dogs, by means of inunction of mercurial ointment, during the winter and
spring of 18G7. The hair of the animal was shaved from the back, and daily
frictions made with the hand on the naked skin with strong mercurial ointment.
In one dog a drachm of the ointment was rubbed in daily for twenty-eight
dnys, and in another for eight days. K"o marked symptoms were produced,
nor was their health impaired. In the first of these dogs a most elaborate
series of observations on the urine was made to determine whether that secre-
tion was in any way influenced. These consisted of careful analyses before
and after the inunction, but with a negative result.

    The frictions occasioned so much troiiblo and loss of time, and appeared to
be attended with such little result, that it was resolved to adopt the more

commodious method of subcutaneous injection of a solution of corrosive sub-

limate. This investigation was undertaken by Dr. W. Eutherford, who car-

ried it to a successful termination, as seen in Table I.
    It will be seen from Table I. that of the six dogs experimented on, three

had, and three had not biliary fistulaj established. This selection was made
with a view to ascertain whether or not the existence of a biliary fistula
affected the action of the mercurinl. Of the six dogs, five were salivated by

 the drug ; of these, three (Dogs A, B, and C) were small dogs -without fistulcc,

 while two (Dogs E and F) were large strong dogs with fistula?.

   AIn dogs and E the action of the drug upon the salivary glands was

 inferred from the occurrence of imusual wetness of the mouth merely ; while

in dogs C, E, and F a stream of saliva was observed flowing from the mouth.

  --In the thi-ee dogs without listukc aged 5 (Dog B), 12 (Dog A), and 15

--(Dog C) months respectively, all of them small animals, decided salivation

followed the administration of 4^ grains of corrosive sublimate, extending
over a period of eight daj"s, to the dog aged 5 months ; of 12i grains, extending
over a period of eighteen days, to the dog 12 months old ; and of 7i grains,
extending over a period of nine days, to the dog 15 months old.

   In the two large strong dogs (Dogs E and F) with bihary fistulas, much

larger quantities of the drug were required to produce well-marked saKvation.
19-,L grains, extending over a period of seven days, to dog F, aged 18 months,
and 19 1 grains, extending over a period of thirteen days, to dog E, aged 24
months. The dog which was not salivated (Dog D) was a retriever 6 months
old, which was poisoned by 1| grain of corrosive sublimate, given in two doses
during twenty hours.

    In all the .six dogs a discharge of mucus from the nostrils was observed
during the administration of the drug ; in some cases it preceded, in others it

Dwas coincident with decided salivation. In dog the nasal discharge was

decided, although sahvation was not observed.
    It can hardly fail to strike anyone that the doses required to produce sali-

vation in these dogs are much larger than those usually required in the case
of man. The dose required in the dog is, however, perhaps not nearly so
great as Table I. makes it appear ; for it must be remembered that a dog
cannot, like a man, tell us when it feels unusual moisture in the mouth. '\\Tieu,
therefore, we have noted salivation as having been produced, it has only been
when the salivation had become very marked, giving rise to unusual wetness

of the mouth, or to a stream of saliva flowing from it.

   In aU the dogs, excepting dog D, the appetite became much impaired, and

the breath remarkably foetid. In dogs A, C, and E the mucous membrane of

the mouth became ulcerated. Mere spongiuess of the gums vras never observed.
   All the dogs, with the exception of dog D, became much emaciated. During

the very decided action of the drug, blood appeared in the fasces of all the dogs,
excepting dog E. Profuse diaiTlioea was produced in all the dogs without
biliary fistulfe ; it was slight in the little dog D, while it was entirely absent
in the other two dogs with fistula;, although these, like all the other dogs,

were kUled by corrosive sublimate. During the exhibition of the drug, the

Afasces in dog changed from a light to dark brown, brownish yellow, and

greenish brown ; in dog B they changed from brown to greenish brown, greenish
yellow, and slate-brown ; while in dog C they hardly underwent any change

in colour. In dogs D and E there was no change in the colour, whUe in dog F

they changed from a clay to a slate-colour: this dog, like the two previous
ones, had a biliary fistula.

                                 Appearances found on Dissection.

   In all the dogs the mucous membrane of the stomach was found healthy.
In all there were numerous bright red vascular patches found on the mucous
membrane of the small intestine, extending from the pylorus to the Ueo-colic

valve. In dog B there were patches of lymph on the inner surface of the
mucous membrane of the ilium. In dogs C and F this redness was most
marked in the duodenum, but the orifice of the common bile-duct was not

redder than the other portions of the duodenum. In all the dogs, except
               --

           ON THE ACTION OF MERCURY ON THE BILIARY SECRETION. 203

dog B, the mucous membraue of the large intestine was streaked with bright

red lines running lougitiidinall_y throughout its entire length.
   In all the dogs, except dog I), there was unusual vascularity of the pan-

creas, but in none was there anj- abnormal appearance of the salivary glands.
    In no case did the liver present any unusual appearance.
    These facts show that on the dog mercury has the same action as it exerts

on man.

                 BETEEMINE THE ACTION OP MeECUET AS A CHOLiGOGUE.

    During the two years over which the Committee's inquiries extended, forty-
one dogs were subjected to the operation for establishing a biliary fistula.
Of these, four died during its performance from the effects of chloroform. In
four others the operation was not proceeded with after opening tlie peritoneum,
in consequence of the impossibility of bringing the fundus of the gall-bladder
in contact with the abdominal wall. The operation was completed in thirty-
three cases, but from various causes, which the Committee consider it unne-
cessary to detail minutely, satisfactory observations could only be carried on
in nine dogs. These have been numbered consecutively from one to nine, but
it has been thought better to arrange the numerous observations made upon
them according to the preparation of mercury employed.

                                      Observations ivith Pil. Hydrargyy'i,

    The first dog' (No. 1) in which a biliary fistula was successfully established
by the Committee was a healthy retriever about eighteen months old, weighing
18-5 kilogrammes, for which we are indebted to Mr. Nunneley of Leeds. The
operation was perfonned on the 29th of May, 1867. The wound in the
abdominal wall healed rapidly. Shortly after the operation the fteces became
clay-coloured. The general health of the animal was excellent when on the
10th of June the apparatus for collecting the bile was applied, and the obser-
vations recorded in the following Table (Table II.) wore commenced.

   As the metrical system of weights is used in all the Tables with regard to
everything except the doses of drugs, it may be of service to remind the

English reader that

     The above series of observations was undertaken with a view to ascertain
 the average amount of bile secreted daily previous to the administration of
 mercury to the animal. It was thought necessary to collect the bile for six
 consecutive days before calculating its average dailj- amount ; for, as is evident
 from the Table, the secretion was very inconstant. Thus on June 15th the
 quantity secreted was only about a half of wliat it was upon the 11th.

     In the above Table three days (the l^th, 14th, and IGth) have been
 omitted, owing to a portion of the bile having been lost. This resulted from
 slipping of the apparatus. Despite every care in its adjustment, it was some-
 times so 'shifted by the movements of the animal that the canula was di-aggcd
 out of the fistula, and the bile consequently lost.

    The average daily amount of bile secreted during the six days was 119-7G
 grammes of fluid bile, 7"G22 grammes of bile solids, and 1-259 gramme of
 bile salts*. The daily amount of food consumed during the whole period was
 uniform. This was due to the fact that for some daj's previous to the com-
 mencement of the bile- collections the dog was offered an excess of food ; the
 amount consumed was estimated, and this amount was given on subsequent
 days, and always entirely eaten by the animal. With a view to assimilate
 all the Tables, a column for water is introduced, although in this ease none
was given.

    In this and all the following Tables, the amount of fluid bile, bile solids, and
salts secreted is estimated with regard to each kilogramme-weight of the
animal, and each 100 grammes of dry food consumed by it. In columns 5 and
C of the foregoing Table these estimates are made on the days when the maxi-

mum and minimum quantities of bile were secreted; and the average quantities

given at the foot of these columns are, in this and all the subsequent Tables,
estimated from the average quantities of columns 2, 3, and 4. Columns 5 and
6 have a special physiological interest, and will be afterwards referred to at
length. For the present the attention of the reader need not be directed to
column 5, for the experience of the Committee has shown that there is no
relation between the amount of bile secreted and the weight of the animal
the relation between the amount of food consumed and the quantity of bile
secreted is not a very close one either (as the foregoing Table is sufficient to
show), yet in some cases it seems to be such as to render necessary its being

taken into account when the influence of any agent upon the biliary secretion

is under consideration f.
    During all the observations on this animal, however, the same amount of

food was taken daily ; therefore any variation in the biliary secretion caiinot
be ascribed to variation in the diet, so thr.t the relation between the secre-

tion of bile and amomit of food may i)i this case for the present be disre-

garded.

   On the 19th of Jiuie it was found necessary to discontinue the observations,

as the pressure of the apparatus liad caused ulceration of the sldn over the

sternum, and the fistula had assumed a vtrj' irritable appearance. The
wound having healed, and the fistula become more healthy, the observations
were resumed on the 28th of June, and continued for other six consecutive

days.

   The results are given in the following Table :

  of the idea it may, indeed, be alleged that on July 14th (Table lY.) more
  fluid and solid bile was secreted under the influence of blue pill than had
  been secreted on any day without it ; but as a counterpart to this it can
  be said that on July 17th (Table IV.) the amount of fluid and solid bile was

 less than it had ever been on any jirevious day. On the whole, therefore,
 it may be concluded that in this case there was no e^^idence that the admi-

  nistration of blue pill affected the biliary secretion.

   Pil. Hydrargyri was again given. Extraordinary variations occurred in

the amount of bile obtained during its exhibition, and the quantities appear
to show that the secretion of bile was diminished ; but they are in truth ren-
dered valueless by the circumstance that a considerable quantity of bile was
separated by the "kidneys, owing, most probably, to its free exit by the fistula
having been" interfered with. The animal was never purged until July 30th,
when it twice passed a considerable quantity of liquid fasces. Although it
did not lose weight to any notable extent cluring the period embraced by
Table V., its strength diminished. In order that the dog might rally, the
observations were suspended, and a more liberal diet allowed. It grew gra-

dually weaker, however, and died ou the 5th of August. On dissection a

layer" of recent lymph was found over the whole surface of the peritoneum.

The cause of the peritonitis was not evident *.

       Ohsh'vations wiili Calomel.

   The second dog (No. 2), with a biliary fistula, was a full-grown half-bred
collie, weighing 15-6 kilogrammes. The operation was performed on the 5th

of September, 1867. The wound healed perfectly, and collection of the bile
was begun on the 20th of September. The general health of the animal
was, however, indifferent ; its appetite was uncertain, and its general strength

feeble. When the apparatus was applied, the animal appeared to be much

distressed by its weight, and by the constriction of the thorax and abdo-

men, whicli its proper application rendered necessary. After the operation

the feces became clay-coloured.
   During seven days, from September 21st to 27th inclusive, observations

were made with a view to determine the normal secretion of bile : the results

--are given in the following Table (Table YI.) :

wliicli the contraction of the recti abdominis always tended to close. At

first, therefore, after the introduction of the canula, a large quantity of Ijilo

pent irp in the ducts may have escaped, or the larger qirautity may have been

due to increased bihary secretion.
    The average quantity of bile secreted daily by dog 2 during the seven

days embraced by Table VI. was of fluid bile 82-46 grammes, of bile solids
5-31 grammes, of bUe salts 1-042 gramme. During the whole period the
animal took a very variable quantity of food ; on two days the amount was
not accurately recorded ; the average quantity of dry food consumed daily
could not therefore be estimated. The biliary secretion was, when com-
pared with the amount of food, extremely variable, however, as column G of
the Table suffices to show.

    The general health of the animal had not materially suffered by the con-
tinued ajiplication of the apparatus, although it at first occasioned so much

distress.

   It was now decided to observe the effects of calomel. Table VII. (p. 209)

gives the results.

   During the six days embraced by Table VII t. calomel was given in-
ternally in varying doses. The effect of the medicine upon the general
healtli of the animal was very decided ; it grew daily weaker and thinner, it
lost its appetite, had attacks of vomiting on October 2nd and 3rd, and died

on October 5th, apparently from inanition. Purgation, foetor of the breath,

or ulceration of the gums were never produced by the drug, nor was there
any evidence of salivation.

   On October 2nd the bile was lost, and on the 3rd, two days before the
death of the animal, and when it took no food, only 2-2 grammes of bile
were secreted. An average has been taken from the first four days during
which the animal took food. The average quantity of fluid bile secreted
during these four days was 60-02 grammes.

   The average qrrantitics of bile solids and salts have not been estimated
seeing that they were not ascertained on September 29t]i. The Table shows
that under the action of the calomel less bile was secreted than there was
previous to its exhibition ; but as the amount of calomel given had seriously,
indeed fatallj', injured the health of the animal, it was determined to try in
the nest case the efiect of minute and frequently repeated doses.

   Dog 3 was a young healthy retriever, weighing 12-9 kilogrammes. The

Aoperation for biliary fistula was performed on the 13th of October, 1867.

few hours afterwards the dog pulled the india-rubber tube out of the fistula,
and the external opening of the fistula closed, so that on October 15th the
fistulous opening had to be reestablished by an incision. The wound in
the abdominal wall healed satisfactorily, the fteces were clay- coloured, and
the animal was in excellent health when the collection of bile was begun,
October, 26th 1867. It was decided to observe the effects of very small
doses of calomel (-J^ of a grain) frequently repeated. The bile was col-
lected on four successive days previous to, and on four consecutive days
during the exhibition of the drug without any break between the two scries.
Table VIII., p. 209, gives tlie results of both series of observations.

    During the four days previous to the administration of the calomel the
animal secreted daily on an average 70-62 grammes of fluid bile, 3-792

grammes of bile solids, and 0-83 gramme of bile salts. The health of the

i.nimal during these days ^yas excellent.

--210 REPORT 1868.

^On October 30tli seven pills, each containing         of a grain of calomel,

were given with an houi-'s interval between each. On October 31st seven

pills, on November 1st fourteen piUs, and on November 2nd sis piUs were

administered in the same way as above mentioned.'

The effect on the general health was very marked. Soon after the admi-

nistration of the drug was beg-uu the appetite failed, and the animal took no

food of any kind during three of the four days. The strength became

rapidly exhausted, and the animal died on November 3, apparently from

inanition. No salivation, foetid breath, ulceration of gums, or purgation

were produced by the medicine.
   The average of the second series of observations shows that during the four

days on which the calomel was given the secretion of bile was not influenced.
It was almost exactly the same in the second as during the fii-st period, thus
distinctly showing that the calomel cannot be said to have afifected it at all.

It is al«o to be observed that although during the second four days the animal

took food only once, the amount of bile secreted was on an average very nearly
the same as during the first four days when it ate well. This might at first
sight be considered as supporting the notion that mercury increases the
biliary secretion. But were it true that in the present case the mercury had

kept up the secretion notwithstanding the diminution in the food, then cer-
tainly it ought to increase the secretion when a due supply of food is taken ;

for it cannot be held that the influence of food is anything but highly favour-

able to the secretion. The results given in Table IX, will show that such is

not the case.

Dog 4 was a healthy collie, about eighteen months old, weighing 19 kilogs.

The operation for biliary fistula was performed on the 19th of October, 1867.

The wound in the abdominal wall healed slowly. As the fistulous opening-

was very irritable, the canula was not introduced. Instead of the canula and

india-rubber bag previously employed,  a  sponge  was  used to  collect the  bile
                                                                                           ;

it was seciu'cd in a tin box below the fistulous opening. The faeces became

clay-coloured soon after the fistula was established.

The general health of the animal was excellent when the observations re-

corded in Table IX. p. 211, were begim.

The bile was collected for five consecutive days previous to the administration

of mercury, in order to ascertain the average amount secreted daily. This was :

of fluid bile 67*1 grammes, of bile sohds 3-592 grammes, of bile salts

0-842 gramme. At the end of this period the dog was in excellent health.

On is ovember 8th the administration of mercury was begun. During the

twenty-four hoiu'S previous to the collection of bile on that day, ten pills,

each containing one-twelth of a grain of calomel, were given, one jnll fit a

time, vnth an hour's interval between each. On the next day twelve such

pills were given. On November 10th ten grains Pil. Hydrargyri were admi-
nistered in one dose. On the 11th and 12tli no mercury was given. On the

13th the ten grains of Pil. Hydiargyri were repeated. On the 14th nine calo-

mel pills were given as above ; and on the last day of the observations the

merciuy was -svithheld.

During the five days on which calomel or blue pill was administered in the

above modes, the amount of bile secreted was diminished to nearly a half of

what it was in the period preceding the administration of the mercuiy ; and

this, although nearly as much food was consumed during as before the exhi-

bition of the drug. Moreover, during the second period, the average amount of

bile sccrcled was, on the whole, greater on the days when no mercury was

giveu thau ou the other days. No purgation or any signs of specific action

were produced by the mercury ; but shortly after its first administration the
strength of the animal began to decline. Sores, produced by the pressure of
the apparatus, formed upon the back, in consequence of which the observations
were interrupted on November loth. The appetite failed, and the animal
became so much emaciated that it was killed on the 28th of November.

    It is evident that in this case the mercury diminished the biliary secretion,
and it is remarkable that it did so without impairing the appetite, and without
producing purgation.

    In the foregoing experiments purgation had never been produced by the
mercurials while the bile was being collected ; it seemed, therefore, desirable
to ascertain the effect upon the biliaiy secretion of purgative doses. This
was done in the following experiment.

   Dog 5 was a strong collie, twelve months old, weighing 16-7 kilogrammes.
The operation for biliary fistxila was performed on the 2nd of June, 1868. The

fistula became satisfactorily established, but on June 28th the dog escaped. It
was reobtaincd on the 11th of July. The fistulous opening had closed, the
dog was jaundiced, conjunctiva and skin yellow, uiine loaded with bile. As
the fceces Avere, however, clay-coloured, an attempt was made to open the
fundus of the gall-bladder. This was found distended with a thick, gelatinous,
colourless fluid like white of egg. About ten ounces of this fluid at once flowed
from the opening. It was not in tlie least tinged with bile. The glairy fluid
continued to di'op from the opening for several hours, after which the bile
began to flow, and continued to do so.

    In ten days every symptom of jaundice had disappeared, the faeces were
clay-coloui'ed, and the -svound was sufliciently healed to permit of observa-
tions being begun. In Table X., p. 213, are recorded the results obtained
before, during, and after purgative doses of calomel and PH. Hydrargyri were

given.

    The bile was collected perfectly on six days in order to ascertain the normal
secretion. The average dally quantity during this period was 357'4 grammes
of fluid bile, 13-11 grammes bile solids, and 3-12 grammes of bile salts.
During the first four days the dog was in exceUeut health. On July 26th it
was seized with a smart attack of diarrhoea. On that day both the fluid and
solid portions of the bile were diminished. The diarrhoea did not recur after
the 26th. On the 27th the collection of bile was rejected, owing to urine
having mingled with it. On the 28th it had risen to a little above the average

 quantity.

    Twenty-four hours previous to the collection of the bile on the 29th, ten
 grains of blue pill were administered. During the three succeeding days ten
 grains of calomel were given daily in one dose on each occasion twenty-four
hours previous to the bile collection. The dose of blue pill and the first dose
 of calomel produced slight purgation, while decided purgation followed the
 administration of the two last doses. There was a marked diminution in the
 biliary secretion during this period, the average daily amount being : of fluid
 bile 272-67 grammes, of bile solids 7-78 grammes, of bile salts 2-06
 grammes. It will be seen from the Table that this diminution is quite as
 marked in the solid as in the fluid bile.

    Tke high amount which the fluid bile attained when ten grains of blue pUl
 were given might be supposed to indicate an increase in the secretion. The
 variations in the amount of solid constituents of the bile are, however, those

which are of paramoiint importance in the present inquiry, and the dimi-
nution of these on the 29th is unmistakeable.

   The bile was finally collected for two days, August 2nd and 3rd, on which
no mercury was given. There was no purgation on these days, and the
amount of bUe secreted suddenly increased. Though the amount was not
nearly so great as before mercury was given, it was nevertheless much above
the last two days during its administration.

   Previous to the exhibition of mercury the fasces were of a clay-colour,
mixed with slate-coloured patches. During and on the two days after the mer-
cury was given they were more uniformly slate-coloured. During the whole
experiment the health of the animal was excellent, neither the diarrhoea nor
the mercurial purgation seemed to affect it.

    This series of observations is most conclusive as to the influence of purgative
doses of calomel upon the biliary secretion. Under their influence there was

a steady diminution in the secretion, and the moment the administration of
the drug was suspended, the secretion underwent an increase.

    It is important to observe that in this case purgation, whether spontaneous
as on the 26th, or as the result of mercurials, diminished the secretion of bile.
Other observations wiU be given further on (sec Tables XVII., XVIII., and

XIX.), which show that when induced bj other drugs it likewise diminishes

the biliary secretion.

   The amount of bile secreted by this dog was very large, greater in proportion
to the weight of the animal than in any other case. At first we were inclined
to suppose that this might be due to the animal being fed upon liver ; but in
the case of dog 6, to be described jircsently, the amount secreted per kilo-
gramme of dog Avas nearly as great, although the animal ate no liver ; and
the amount per 100 grammes of dry food was very much greater.

    In the foregoing experiment the dose of blue pill given, although it
diminished the bile soKds. increased that of the bile fluid. It was
important to ascertain whether or not the same result would be obtained on
another trial. In another dog (No. 7) ten grains of blue pill were given on
one day, and fifteen grains on the day following. Slight purgation was pro-

duced by the first dose, decided purgation by the second. On the day pre-

ceding the administration of the mercury, the amount of fluid bile was 173-9
grammes, of bile solids 9-35 grammes. The bile was lost on the day that
the first dose of blue pill was given, but on the next day it had fallen to 119-9
grammes, and the bile solids to 7-5 grammes.

   On both days the animal consumed about the same quantity of food. It is

therefore clear that the obsei'vation recorded in the case of dog 5 on the 29th
of July cannot be held as indicating the power of blue pill to increase the
fluid portion of the bile ; while this observation on dog 7 only confirms the
result in the case of dog 5, viz. that a purgative dose of blue pill diminishes
the amount of bile solids secreted.

and ia doses of two grains from two to six times a day, did not produce pur-
gation or increase the biliary secretion (Tables YII., VIII., and IX.).

   4. Calomel, when given in doses which produced purgation, diminished the

biliary secretion (Table X.).

                                   Observations with Corrosive Sublimate,

   Dog 6, a retriever, six months old, weighing 54 kilogrammes, was operated

on for biliary fistula, Febi'uary 26th, 1868. The recovery was in this case
speedy and perfect. Soon after the operation the faeces became clay-colonred.
The health of the animal was excellent, and was not appreciably injured by

the operation or the effects of the fistula.
    Table XI. p. 215, gives the results of the observations, with corrosive sub-

limate on four consecutive days, three previous to, and one during the admi-

nistration of tlie drug.

    During the three days previous to the administration of the mercury, the
secretion of fluid and solid bile was rcmarkablj^ constant, and this notwith-

standing great variation in the amount of food taken. The mean quantity
was, of fluid bile 105-4 grammes, of bile solids 4-144 grammes, of bile
salts 0-948 gramme. The constancy in the secretion rendered the case a
very valuable one for observing whether or not it was aftected by the drug.
On tlie fourth day two doses of 4 of a grain of corrosive sublimate were
injected imder the skin. The first dose was given at 1 r.Ji. on the 11th,
immediately after the collection of bile had been made on that day. The
second dose was given at 9 a.m. on the 12th, and the last collection of bile
was made at 1 p.m. on the same day. The amount of fluid bile on this the
fourth day was 78 grammes, of bile solids 3-178 grammes, of bile salts
0-717 gramme. Twenty hours after the first dose of the drug was given, a
slight discharge of mucus from the nostrils was observed, and a patch of
semisolid clay-coloured faeces mingled with a few di'ops of blood was found
upon the floor. Two hours following the administration of the second dose,
the animal was observed to be exceedingly weak ; it was in a state of con-
stant tremor, and staggered on attempting to walk. At 1 r.M. on the 12th, four
hours after the second dose of mercury was given, the last collection of bile
was made ; at that time the nasal discharge had become more marked. There
was no apparent salivation, nor was the breath foetid. The animal was last

seen alive at 5.30 p.m. on the 12th, eight and a half hours after the second
dose had been given. At that time there was no apparent change in its
condition, further than that it had become so weak that it was no longer able
to stand, unless supported. It died during the following night. In the
morning (13t]i) a patch of liquid faeces of a clay-colour was found upon the
floor. Ten grammes of bile were foimd in the bag attached to the canula.

   The result of this experiment was briefly this : li grain corrosive subli-
mate, given in the course of 24 hours to a dog 6 months old, caused purgation

Avith liquid bloody faeces, nasal discharge, diminution of the biliary secretion,
general tremor, and finally death.

   For dissection of this dog see Table I., Dog D. It will be observed that

the stomach still contained a portion of undigested food.
   As the animal had been poisoned by the drug, it was determined to

observe the efl'ects of smaller and gradually increasing doses. It was thought
that if the drug can increase the biliary secretion, we, by beginning with a
very small dose a7id gradually increasing its strength, would certainly hit
upon the amount necessary to do so ere poisonous symptoms set in ; moreover
we should observe the effects of the repeated exhibition of small 4oses.

--318 REPORT 1868.

   Dog 7 "was a strong full-grown retriever, weighing 27*4 kilogrammes,
for which we were indebted to Dr. Kelburne King, of Hull. The operation
for biliary fistula was performed on the 24th of April, 1868. The healing
of the wound around the fistula was so slow that observations could not be
begun before the 29th of May. Table XII. p. 215, gives the results pre-

vious to the administration of corrosive sublimate.

   During the five days embraced by Table XII., the amount of food

consumed was constant. On May 31st the bile was unfortunately lost,

owing to the apparatus having slipped. The average quantity secreted
during the remaining four days was of fluid bile 127"15 grammes, of bile
solids 6-43 grammes, of bile salts 1-03 gramme. The observations were

interrupted on accoant of repairs needed in the apparatus. When resumed

on the 5th of June, the dog was in excellent health. Table XIII. p. 217,
gives the results of observations during the administration of small and gra-

dually increasing doses of corrosive sublimate.

   During the first three days i of a grain of corrosive sublimate was
injected u.nder the skin once a day. During the next six days the same
quantity was injected twice a day, and on the tenth day (June 16) the dose
was increased to g of a grain at the second injection.

   During these ten days the biliary secretion underwent marked variations
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

the average daily quantity was IIS'S grammes of fluid bile, 5-972 grammes of
bile solids, and 0-99 gramme of bile salts. These figures show that there was
a slight diminution in the biliary secretion during this period. At the same
time, however, the amount of food consumed had undergone a considej'ablc
decrease, but the health of the animal had not suffered, and its weight
remained almost exactly the same. On June 17, the increased dose of i
of a grain twice a day was given. Athough these doses produced no pur-
gation, foetid breath, or salivation, yet the dull eye and general drooping
uneasy aspect of the animal showed that the general health was deci-
dedly impaired. On that day (l7th) there was a great decrease in the
biliary secretion. The bile solids fell to about a third, and the fluid bile to
about a fourth of what it had been on the previoiis day. The amount of
food consumed, however, had been but slightly diminished, as compared
with the previous day ; but a glance at the Table will suffice to show that
more food was consumed on the 17th than on the 11th, 13th, and 15th. On
all these days at least thrice as much fluid bile, and about twice as much
bile solids had been secreted. On June 18 only -1- of a grain was given

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

and after the collection of bile on that day the observations were suspended,
on account of the very marked impairment of the general health occasioned

--by the mercury. On that day the following is the note that was taken of

the condition of the animal: "Tlie dog looks miserable and lifeless, his

health is evidently much impaired, there is no salivation, foetid breath,
nasal discharge, or purgation." The quantity of bile secreted on the 18th,
though above that of the previous day, was nevertheless very low. The

consumption of food had greatly diminished ; and it should be noticed that
on the 10th the biliary secretion, instead of undergoing a still further dimi-
nution, consequent on the decreased consumption of food, was, in fact,
augmented. This, in our opinion, could only be attributed to the inf uence

of a smaller dose of the drug.

    The collection of the bile was in this case quite perfect on every day,
with one exception (May 31), recorded in Table XII. The observations
distinctly show that corrosive sublimate, given in small gradually increasing
doses, did not augment the bihary secredon. On the contrary, they point out
ON THE ACTION Ol? MERCURY ON THE BILIARY SECRETION, 219
220 REPORT-- 1868.

 that so long as the general health remained good, the amount of bile n^as
not changed, but as soon as the animal became weak, diminution of the

 secretion at once took place.

    Dog 8 was a strong mongrel collie, about five years old, weighing 19-3
kilogrammes. The operation for biliary fistula was performed on the 2nd of
June, 1868. The recovery was rapid, and observations, with a view to
determine the normal secretion of bile, were commenced June 17th. The
results are given in Table XIY. p. 217.

    The bile was perfectly collected for eight days. On one day (20th) the

apparatus was not applied. AVheu the observations were commenced, the
animal was in perfect health, the faeces were quite white and semisolid.

On the 21st it had a slight attack of diarrhoea, which had, however, disap-
peared on the following day. With this exception, the health of the animal

was exceedingly good during the whole period, and instead of a loss there
was a slight gain in weight. The diminution of the biliary secretion on
the 21st cannot be ascribed to the diarrhoea, seeing that on the next day,
when it had ceased, a still greater decrease took place. The average daily
amount of bile during the above period was, of fiuid bile 180-2 grammes,
of bile solids 5-96 grammes, of bile salts 1-07 gramme. The dog's appetite
was remarkably good. It was decided that corrosive sublimate should now
be given in small and gradually increasing doses as in the previous case.

Table XV. p. 219, gives the results.
   During the first eight days i of a grain of corrosive sublimate was

given twice a day. On July 5th and Gth f of a grain were given in the
day. On July 7th and Sth the dose was | of a grain twice a day. Until

July Sth the animal continued in good health ; then its appetite began

to fail.

   The average amount of bile secreted daily during the twelve days from
June 27th to July Sth inclusive was, of fluid bile 150-19 grammes, of bile
solids 3-37-1 grammes, and of bile salts 1-135 gramme. During this period
the amount of fluid bile was one-sixth less than during the premerciu'ial
period ; but the diminution in the bile solids was still more marked, the
average quantity not being much more than a half of what was secreted
during the prcmcrcurial period. This diminution was entirely due to a de-
crease in the organic solids of the bile, indeed the amount of the inorganic
solids was slightly increased.

   On July 9th two-thirds of a grain were given, as on the two previous
days. The falling off in the appetite now became more marked, and the

animal looked ill. There was a great failure in the biliary secretion ; fluid
and solid bile were reduced to abo\it a half of what they had been on the
previous day. One-third of a grain was given upon the following day
(10th). This was the last dose. Symptoms of seriously deteriorated health
were very apparent some hours after it was given. The animal refused
almost all food ; it looked very languid ; its breath was fretid ; there was
slight salivation, and on the mucous membrane inside the upper lip there
was an incipient ulcer, which experience regarding the eff'ccts of mcrcurinls
on the mouths of other dogs enabled us to recognize as mercurial. The
fseces, which previous to the administration of the mercury had been white,
were during the greater period of exhibition sometimes white, at other times
grey, and during the two last days of a slate-coloiar. There never was

purgation. Latterly the animal became rapidly emaciated. Up to tlie 0th

it maintained its weight well, but during the last four days it lost 3--19 kilo-
                             ·

      ON THE ACTION OF MERCURY ON THE BILIARY SECRETION. 231

grammes. The amount of bile secreted on the 10 th was still further dimi-

nished, the fluid bile being little more than a ninth of the average quantity

secreted during the twelve days from June 27th to July Sth inclusive ; while
the bile solids were little more than a thirtieth of the average quantity se-

creted during the same period.

  In  the  case  of  dog  8  six  grains, in  that of  dog 7  four  grains  of corro-

_

sive sublimate were required to bring about the same result as regards the

biliary secretion. This was apparently due to the fact that dog 8 was an

older and a stronger dog. But although the biliary secretion held out longer

against the drug in this animal, the constitutional symptoms were more
marked. Thus salivation, foetid breath, and ulceration of the gums were

present, while these were wanting in dog 7. This fact adds greatly to the

value of the observations on dog 8 ; for it shows when mercury is given to an

extent sufficient to increase the function of the salivary glands, it diminishes

the biliary function of the liver.

   The impression produced by the drug upon the health of dog 8 was deep
and lasting. Although its administration and the collection of bile wore
stopped on July 10th, the emaciation of the animal continued to increase
rapidly. The appetite was very poor on the 14th, there was cofFce-ground

vomiting, blood was passed in the faBces, and there was a decided muco-

purulent discharge from the left nostril. The ulcer in the mouth became
larger. The animal, which previous to the administration of the mercury
had been so strong and vigorous, grew so weak that it could hardly walk,
and it was killed July 25th. On dissection six hours after death nothing
abnormal was found. The hepatic cells seemed healthy. The intestine,

pancreas, and salivary glands were not unduly vascular.

Besults of the preceding Observations on the Cholagoc/ue Action of Corrosive
                                                         Sublimate.

   These two series of obseiwations on dogs 7 and 8 so closely resembled

--each other, and were so perfectly carried out, that there was no possibility

of fallacy. They show :

   1. That corrosive sublimate, when given in small doses, gradually in-
creased in strength, docs not augment the biliary secretion, but that it dimi-
nishes it the moment the dose reaches a strength sufficient to deteriorate the

general health.

  2.  That corrosive  sublimate given in      the  above  method may diminish the

^

biliary secretion, while it does or does not produce an evident action on the

salivary glands and mouth, and without producing purgation.

3. Case 6 shows that the biliary secretion is likewise diminished when

this drug is given in a dose sufficient to produce purgation.

   The next subject which engaged our attention was the mode in which
the mercury had caused a diminution of the biliary secretion in dogs 7
and 8.

    The experiment on dog 8 seemed strongly to point to the diminished
consumption of food as the cause of the diminished biliary secretion. With
a view to throw furtlier light on this matter, we performed the following
experiment on the

                  Influence of Partial Starvation on the Biliary Secretion.

   For the following experiment dog 7 was used, whicli had thoroughly
recovered its health and strength.
--232 REPORT 1868.

    Table XYI., p. 219, shows the results of the observations before, during,

and after partial starvation.
   During the first two days the amount of bile fiiiid and solids secreted was

very nearly the same. The amount of dry food consumed was also nearly

alike.

   On the 2Sth, bread, milk, and water were withheld. It was intended to give

the usual allowance of tripe, but as it could not be obtained, liver was given

instead. On this day the amount of fluid bile feU to 104-8 grammes, as
compared with 140 grammes on the two previous days, but the bUe solids

rose to about a half more than they had previously been. This was almost
wholly due to increase of the organic constituents of the bile ; for it will be seen
from the Table that the bile salts (inorganic solids) were scarcely at all in-
creased. July 29th 453 grammes of water were given without any dry food.

   The quantity of fluid bile secreted was only 41-6 grammes, less than a
third of the quantity on the days previous to starvation. The amount of bile
solids was 2-77 grammes, rather more than a half of the quantity secreted

during the first period, while the inorganic constituent of the bile feU to

0-40 gramme, less than a half of the amount during the fii'st period. On
the 30th of July it was intended that the animal should return to the diet
of July 27th, but the tripe was accidentally withheld. The amount of fluid

bile rose on that day to 85-7 grammes, bile solids to .5'11 grammes, and
bile salts to 0-87 gramme. iUthough the dry food consumed on this day
was hardly one-fifth of what it was on July 26th, the amount of bile sohds

and salts was almost the same. On July 31st the partial starvation was

discontinued ; the animal consumed the same amount of diy food as on July
26th, with nearly a fourth more A\atcr. The fluid bile on that day reached
a quantity 33-1 grammes above what it was on the 26th, when the same
quantity of food Avas given, while the amount of bile soHds and salts was nearly
doubled. It is difficult to account for this marked increase in the biliary
secretion when the full diet was again given. Dm-ing the whole experiment
the animal was in excellent health, and lost only 0-9 kilogramme in weight.

    The preceding observations are sufiieient to show that the biliary secretion
is greatly influenced by the great amount of food consumed, and it permits of

the inference that diminution in the bihary secretion observed in the case

of dog 8 under the influence of corrosive subhmate may have been due to
impaired appetite. The same explanation cannot apply to the diminution in

the bihary secretion observed in the case of dog 7 on June 17 (see Table XIII.) ;
for, as has been previously pointed out, on that day the animal took more food

than it had done on many previous days on Avhich it had secreted a larger

amount of bile.

   On the v>holc, therefore, the legitimate conclusion seems to be that mercury,
when administered so as to impair the general nutrition, lessens the biliary
secretion. This mny result without impairment of the appetite; but when

there is a diminished consumption of food, the failiu'e in the biliary secretion

is all the more marked.

                  Conclusions regardincf the Cholagogue Action of Mercury.

    The foregoing observations seem to us clearly to show that Pil. Hydrargyri,
calomel, and corrosive subhmate, when given to dogs in either small, gradually

 augmented, or in large doses, do not increase the bihaiy secretion ; they do not
 even influence it so long as neither purgation nor impairment of health are

 produced, but they diminish it as soon as they do either or both. It may be
OS THE ACTION OF MERCXJIIY ON THE BILIARY SECRETION. 223

urged that, although we have proved this regardLag dogs, it does not follow
that on man these drugs will have the same action. It must be admitted

that some animals are altogether insensible to remedies which produce power-

ful effects on oiliers, that different doses are often requisite to occasion similar

results, and that there may be peculiarities so very decided as to render it

impossible to infer what will be the action of a remedy on one animal from its
influence upon another. But have we any reason to conclude that in the pre-

sent instance there exists such difference iu the action of mercury as to prevent

any inference being drawn from the dog regarding man? All the facts with

which we are acquainted show that it is legitimate to infer that the action of

Wemercury ought to be regarded as similar in both cases.  have demon-

strated that, as regards its action upon the saHvarj' glands, mouthy intestine,

Weappetite, and general nutrition, the influence of mercmy is the same.  there-

fore infer that it is in the highest degree probable that its action on the hepatic

secretion will also be the same. The only difference that there seems to be be-

tween the dog and man, as regards the action of mercury, consists iu the fact

that in the dog larger doses are generally requii'ed to produce the same effects

as those observed in man. But even here it may be argued that more marked

results are required to satisfy the observer, and hence the greater dose neces-

sary. These circumstances, therefore, cannot be held as affecting the conclu-

sion at which v,c have arrived.

  We have not deemed it worth our while to experiment upon any other

animal, for we are unable to see how such experiments could materially

strengthen our position. Even though we had shown that mercury when

given to a rabbit, eat, pig, donke}', or horse diminishes the biliary secretion,

it might still be said that this does not apply to man. But there are several

special reasonswhich render experiments on these animals either impracticable

or less reliable than those on the dog. Bidder and Schmidt failed to establish

biliary fistulas in cats, we therefore thought it not worth our while to spend
money and time in making the attempt. Horses and donkeys are too un-

wieldy for the purpose and have no gaU-bladders, a peculiarity which would

in all probability render it impossible to establish bUiary fistulse in them. In

pigs the hepatic secretion differs from that of man, inasmuch as it contains

hyocholic acid, and according to Strecker no sulphur. It might, therefore, not

unfairly be objected to any inferences from experiments on pigs that, inasmuch

as the porcine differs from the human hepatic secretion, it could not be held as

altogether probable that mercury would iufluonce both in the same way.

Everything seems to show that the animals used by the Committee are those

best suited for the observations they have made. In addition to the thera-

peutical facts previously mentioned, which after all are the most important,

there are these, that the qualitative composition of canine is the same as that

of human bile, and that the dog, like man, can be fed on a flesh, vegetable

or mixed diet. In this respect they are superior to most others, even to the

Quadrumana, which though in conformation most resembling man are vege-

table feeders. So far, therefore, as direct experiment and exact observations

are capable of determining the influence of mercury upon the biliary secretion,

the Committee have no doubt that the dog is superior to the animals above

mentioned.

But it may be supposed that mercurials posse&s some specific power of ex-

citing the biliary secretion by acting on the orifice of the common bile-duct,

and so stimulating the secretion through the nerves which connect it with the

liver, just as pyrethrum or vinegar stimulates the salivary glands when they are

applied to the orifices of the saKvary ducts. It might also be objected that.
224 REtoRT--18G8.

inasmuch as in our experiments tlie common bile-duct had been divided, the

nerves aUuded to might have been so injured that stimulation of the orifice of

the common bile-duct could no longer excite the secretion. It remains to be

shown, however, that mercurials do speciallj* excite the oi'ifice of the bile-duct.

It is not probable, at any rate, that their influence on the biliary secretion was,

in the cases of dogs G, 7, and 8, prevented by division of hepatic nerves. In

these experiments the common bUe-duct was simply divided with as little

injury to neighbouring parts as i^ossible (in previous experiments a portion

of the bile-duct was removed), and these animals did not suffer in the least

from the shock after the operation ; so that nervous injury could not have

been extensive. Moreover, in the case of dog 7, the parts around the com-

mon bile-duct were dissected after death, and the nerves proceeding from the

solar plexus to the liver were found at some distance from the duct, and had

apparently suffered no injury at the place where it had been divided. The

Committee, therefore, do not attach anj- value to this objection.

But some may say that although wc have proved that mercurj" diminishes

the biliary secretion in dogs and that in man its action wiU in all probability

be the same, yet our experiments have been performed on animals in a state

of health, and that had they been made on dogs with diseases such as those

in which mercury has been siqrposed to increase the hepatic secretion, it would

possibly, in the case of such dogs, have been increased. With such an hypo-

thesis we need not seriously occupy om-selves until the objectors prove tliat,

in any case whatever, mercury can increase the biliary secretion in man.

  We have been unable to discover any facts brought to light in this or any

other age which prove that mercury stimulates the biliary secretion. So far

as we can make out, the notion that it does so originates in some vague

statement made by Paracelsus*, or the authors of his time, as to the good

effects of mercury in what he has called " icteritia.'' Bnt, we repeat, not
only do we not know how such a notion has arisen, but wo are ignorant
how to make direct observations on the subject in man. AVe have already

stated that such observations are, in the present state of physiological che-

Wemistry, impossible (sec p. 187).    do not deny the possibility of mercury

being useful in some diseases of the liver ; we simply say that the notion

of its doing good by increasing the biliary secretion is untenable.

        Observations on PonopnTLLixE and Taraxacum as CnoLAGOGiTES.

   Before concluding our observations on dogs with biliary fistuloe, the Com-
mittee thought it would bo important to try the effect of two other drugs
which have been supposed to exercise a cholagogue influence on the liver,

viz. podophylline and taraxacum.

         Observations with PoflophyUlne.

   Dog 9 was a retriever, about three years old, weighing 2G-G kilogrammes,
and the operation for biliary fistulas was performed upon July 2-1:, 18G8. The
recovery was rapid. tShortly after the operation tlie fajcos were clay-

coloured. Table XVII., p. 225, shows the results of the bile collections pre-
vious to, during, and after the administration of podophylline.

--226 REPORT 1868.

   On August 7th and 8th the bile was collected to ascertain the normal
secretion previous to the exhibition of the drug. On the ninth day 2 grains

of Eesina PodophyUi (prepared by Messrs. Gardner and Ainslie, druggists,
Edinburgh) were given. This amount did not produce purgation. The

bile was collected 24 hours after the dose was given, and it was found that
the fluid bile had risen from 285-8 to 304-2 grammes, but the solid bile had

fallen from 14-5 to 12-9 grammes. On the 10th no medicine was given. On
that day the fluid bile fell somewhat, while the solid bile rose. On the

11th 4 grains of podophylline were given. Decided purgation followed.

A --marked diminution in the fluid and solid bile was the result the fluid

bile fell from 287 to 203-2 grammes, the bile sohds from 13-31 to 10-85

grammes. On the 12th no medicine was given : the fluid bile rose to 238-2
grammes, while, strange to say, the bile solids fell to 6-62 grammes. On

the 13th 6 grains of podophylline were given. Decided purgation followed.

The fluid bile fell to 151-2, the bile sohds to 4 grammes. On the 14th

no medicine was given, and, notwithstanding the purgation, the dog was in

excellent health. On the 14th the fluid bile rose to 238-4, the bile solids

to 12-87 grammes.

   These observations clearly show that in this case podophylline, when it

produced purgation, diminished the biliary secretion. This decrease cannot
be accounted for by diminution in the amount of food taken. Certainly
such an explanation might be advanced to account for the fall in the quan-
tity secreted on the 11th, but it cannot possibly apx^ly to the great fall upon

the 13th.
    Little attention need be paid to the increase in the bile fluid on the 9th,

when 2 grains of podophylline were given without purgation resulting ; for
it was only 18-4 grammes, whereas on the 8th there had been a rise of 12-8
grammes over the quantity on the previous day, without any di'ug having

been given ; moreover, on the 9th the bile solids fell to a decided extent.

   The observations recorded in Table XVIII. p. 225, were made on dog 7,

after he had regained his health.
   The bile was collected for five days previous to the exhibition of podo-

phylline. On one of these (August 8) the dog had a smart attack of dysen-

--tery ; on that day the solid and fluid bile was much below what it was

on any other day of the period another evidence of the lowering influence

of purgation upon the biliary secretion.

On August 15th 8 grains of podophylline were given; it produced

profuse purgation, and so weakened the animal that it staggered when it

Avalked.  The  bile was  collected  24  hours  after  the  dose was  given                            both
                                                                                                   ;

fluid and solid bile had undergone a great diminution. It is curious to

observe that the purgation produced by the podophylline, although it was

accompanied by a diminished consumption of food, did not lessen either the
fluid or solid portions of the bile to the extent effected by the attack of
dysentery, although the latter was accompanied by comparatively slight
depression of the general health and appetite. Throughout the observations

in Table XYIII. the faeces were of a slate-colour.
   The observations were discontinued owing to the weakness of the animal.

The observations recorded in Table XIX. p. 227, were made on dog 5 after

it had regained its health.
   The bile was collected for two days, August 23rd and 24th, to ascertain

the normal secretion. On August 25th and 26th 6 grains of Eesina Podo-

phyUi were given ; both doses occasioned decided purgation. The effect on
the biliary secretion was unequivocal. On the day preceding that on which
   ON THE ACTION OF MERCURY ON THE BILIARY SECRETION. 227

the first dose was given tlie fluid bile was 220-9 grammes, bile solids 10-42

grammes                                on  the  foUowiiig  day  the  fluid  bile was 154-5  grammes.  After
                                    ;

the second dose the fluid bile was 150 grammes, the bUe solids 1-95 gramme.

The next day (27th) no medicine was given, and the fluid bile rose to 297

grammes, and the bile solids to 11-99 grammes, most conclusively showing

that doses of i)odophylline which produce purgation diminish the fluid and

solid constituents of the bile.

due to other causes. On September 2nd, when no taraxacum was given,
the bile rose to the extent of 38-5 grammes over the amount on the previous

day, and on September 3rd it fell to the extent of 57-5 grammes without any
assignable cause. On the whole, therefore, it seems that taraxacum exercised
no influence upon the biliary secretion. On Sej^tember 3rd the observations
were discontinued, as the margins of the fistula liad bejome much lalcerated.

   Taraxacum was also given to dog 7, which had been the subject of the
observations recorded in Tables XII., XIII., XVI., and XVIII., which had

recovered his health.

the extent of 1 1-2 grammes, and the bile solids to the extent of 0-23 gramme.
Next day 240 grains were given, and the fluid bile fell to the extent of 21-6
grammes, while the bile soUds rose to the extent of 0-38 gramme. These
doses produced no effect upon the bowels. The faeces were always solid.
The dog was in most exceUeut health when these observations were discon-

tinued.

   The observations recorded in Table XX. show, even more conclusively than

those recorded in Table XIX., that taraxacum did not influence the biliary
secretion in any way whatever.

      Results of the Observations recorded in Tables XVII., XVIII. , XIX.,

                                            and XX.

   1. Doses of podophylline, varying from 2 to 8 grains, when given to dogs

diminished the solid constituents of the bile, whetlier they produced purga-

tion or not.

    2. Doses which produced purgation lessened both the fluid and solid con-

stituents.

    3. During an attack of dj'sentery both the fluid and solid constituents of
the bile were greatly lowered.

    4. Doses of the solid extract of taraxacum, varying from 60 to 240 grains,
aff'ected neither the biliary secretion, the bowels, nor the general health of

the animal.

                Influence of Purgation upon the Biliary Secretion.

   The observations of the Committee conclusively show that purgation pro-
duced by a variety of causes diminished both the" fluid and solid constituents

of the biliary secretion. Spontaneous diarrhoea (Table X.), dysentery,
(Table XVIII.), and purgation produced by Pil. Hydrargyri (Table X., and
non-tabulated observations on dog 7, see p. 214),' by calomel (Table X.),
by corrosive sublimate (Table XI.), and by podoiihyllinc (Tables XVII.,
XVIII., aud XIX.) always diminished the solid constituents of the bile, and
with one exception (see July 29, Table X.) the fluid portion of the bile also.
That purgation diminishes the biliary function of the liver is one of the most
important facts established by the Committee. It is, however, nothing more
than ^^·lmt might have been expected, seeing that purgation drains the portal
blood from which the bile is almost entirely formed.

       Relation of Biliary Secretion to Consumption of Food.

The observations of the Committee show that the relation between the

biliary secretion and the amount of food consumed is by no means such a

close one as Bidder, Schmidt, Arnold, and others have supposed. On looking

at the collections of bile in the healthy animal previous to the administration

of drugs, it will frequently be seen that while eating the same food, and

without there being any apparent disturbing cause, such as diarrhoea, &c.,
the amount of bile was nearly a half (Tables II. and III.) and even four-

fifths less (Table VIII.) than on previous and subsequent days. Further, it
was frequently observed that although the amount of food consumed varied

greatly the secretion of bile was remarkably constant. In Table XI. are

observations which illustrate this fact. During three days of perfect health

the animal secreted very nearly a constant amount of bile fluid and bile sohds,

although the amount of food varied greatly. Thus on the first day it took
73-7 grammes of dry food, on the second day it took 14-16, and on the

third  day 62-37 grammes                                                                                                         on  these  days  the  amount of bile  secreted per
                                                                                                                              ;
230 REPORT 1868.

100 grammes of dry food was on tlie first day 5-64 grammes, on the second
day 30*4 grammes, and on the third day 6-9 grammes. The observations
recorded in Table XVI. show, however, that the biliaiy secretion was in the
case of dog 7 greatly influenced by the amount of dry food ; it will there be
.seen that the amount of bile secreted was greatly diminished by stai-vation.
It therefore appears that the biliary secretion is in some cases greatty in-
fluenced by the amount of food taken, while in other cases it is not influenced

 at all.

         Relation between Biliast Secretion and Weight of Antmal.

   The close relation supposed to exist between the amount of the biliary
secretion and the size or weight of the animal has not been supported by the
observations of the Committee. The amount of bUe secreted for every kilo-
gramme weight of dog varied greatly in different cases, as the following

Table shows.

--Table XXI. Average amount of BUe secreted per Kilogramme Weight of

     the Dog« observed by the Committee before drugs were administered.

portion to the rest of the body than it is in more advanced age. To ascer-
tain whether or not there he anything in this idea would require observations
to be made on dogs of various sizes and ages. The biliary secretion, amount
and nature of food, and weight of the animal would require to be observed
for three or four days ; the animal ought then to be immediately killed and
its liver weighed, and calculations based on such data. It is, however,
improbable that the size of the liver determines the amount of the biliary
secretion ; the great variation which we frequently observed in the secre-
tion from day to day in the same animal is opposed to such an idea.

        Effect of the loss of Bile upon the Health of the Animal.

Although an animal may live in perfect health for a considerable time

without any bile passing into its ahmentary canal, it would appear, from the

observations of all who have experimented on the subject, that, even when

a fistula has been established without accident, the health sooner or later

begins to suffer. Emaciation comes on, and death results from inanition.

Much depends on the strength of the animal, which, when vigorous, usually

preserve their health.

Dog 7, the retriever sent us by Dr. Kelburne King of Hull, had the

operation for biliary fistula performed on April 24, 1868. jSTotwithstanding

the wearing of apparatus for collecting the bile during a period of nearly

two months, partial poisoning with corrosive sublimate, purgation with

podophylline, and dosing with taraxacum, the animal was on the 11th of

September, 1868, when our observations terminated, as strong as it was

before  the  fistula  was  made                        and  so far from  exhibiting  any  signs  of emacia-
                                                    ;

tion, it had gained nearly 4 kilogrammes (8-8 pounds) in weight during the

five months it lived, without a drop of bile passing into the intestines. Such

a case favours the view of Blondlot and Arnold, as to the inutility of the

bile for the purposes of digestion. It is in itself quite sufiicient to show

that the entrance of bile into the alimentary canal is not essential for the

health of the animal, and supports the idea that the bile is a secretion

destined to be little more than a mere excretion.

          Effect of Musctjlab Movements upon the Plow of the Bile.

    It was frequently observed that when the dogs were taken out of their
cages, in which their movements were much circumscribed, and allowed to
run about, that during the first half hour or so of their increased movement
the amount of bile discharged by the fistula was greatly augmented. This
was in all probability due to the bile being more rapidly expelled from the
hepatic ducts by the pressure upon the liver of the contracting abdominal
muscles, which must, when in action, compress the liver like a sponge, and
so expel its contained fluid. This fact is valuable in serving to show that
exercise may have an important influence upon the liver. It further points
out, however, how utterly fallacious must the results have been had we
endeavoured to estimate the daily secretion of bile from collections made
during a few minutes at a time, such as were made by Bidder and Schmidt
regarding which, however, we have previously expressed our opinion.

    It is unnecessary to dwell upon the importance of the results which the
Committee have taken so much pains to arrive at. If the refutation of a
widespread error be as important as the establishment of a new truth, the
practical advantage of demonstrating that mercury is not a cholagogue can-
not be too highly estimated. Although in recent times the administration of
233 KBPOKT--1868.

mercurials for hepatic diseases has greatly diminished, their employment is

stiU very general, and in India almost universal. Eecent cases demonstrate

that long-continued salivation and great loss of health have been produced

in the attempt to remove old abscesses or other chronic diseases of this organ,

and there are few of its lesions in which it is stiU not thought advisable to

try small or fuU doses of the drug.

On this subject, however, it is unnecessary to dwell at present ; the real

question is, whether the evidence is satisfactory, or whether further re-

searches are necessary. On this and many other topics connected with

therapeutics, what we require are not unfounded assumptions and vague spe-

culations, but positive knowledge based on imquestionable data ; these we

have furnished, and consider them amply sufficient to demonstrate the fallacy

of the opinions everywhere prevalent as to the cholagogue action of mercury.

It would be vain attempting to convey an adequate idea of the great la-

bour, wearisome repetitiou of observations, numerous disappointments, and

loathsome manipulations which have tested the zeal, endurance, and courage

of Drs. Rutherford and Gamgee, on whom the entii'c labour of the experi-

ments devolved.

The difficulties and expense have been greatly increased by the want of a

proper locality for carrying on such investigations, and by the necessity of
combating the well-meaning but, we humbly think, mistaken notions of those

who maintain that physiologists are not justified in experimenting on animals,

even with the objects of determining more accurately the use of poisonous

Adrugs and of preserving the life of man.  very different doctrine might

have been expected to exist in a great University like that of Edinburgh ; but

its Senatus, led astray by the reasoning, we regret to say, of an influential

member of the Medical Faculty, unquestionably, by its resolutions, greatly

added to the toil and annoyance of the Committee's proceedings. On the

other hand our warmest thanks are due to Mr. Nunnelcy of Leeds, to Dr. Kel-

burne King of Hull, and Dr. Andrew Buchanan of Glasgow, for their kind

assistance in forwarding animals to us.

             Last Report on Dredging among the Shetland Isles.

                        By J. GwYN Jeffreys, F.R.S.

This was my eighth expedition to the northern extremity of our seas, and

occupied the whole of the summer. It was not so successful as those in some

previous years, owing to the stormy state of the weather. While my friends

in England, Wales, Ireland, and Scotland were enjoying calm sunshine, our
climate was exactly the reverse ; and the persevering course of the wind

(from north-west to south-west) prevented our doing much at sea. This

part of the North Atlantic is notoriously subject to broken weather, it being

the point where the warm air induced by the Gulf-stream and westerly
winds meets the cold air brought down by the arctic current. The fauna of

the Shetland waters, however, is by no means exhausted. Every expedition
has produced novelties, not only in the MoUusca, but in aU other depart-
ments of marine zoology.

   On the present occasion I obtained, at a depth of 120 fathoms, a living

specimen and a larger dead one of a fine species of Pleurotoma, P. carinata
of Bivona. It was originally described as a Calabrian fossil ; Jan and Bel-
lardi have given it from the Upper Tertiaries of North Italy, the former un-

der the name of Fusus modiolus ; and Scarlcs Wood records a single specimen
                -- ;;

                                                                                         ON DREDGING AMONG THE SHETLAND ISLES.                      233

having been found in the Coralline and another in the Red Crag. Professor

Sars and Mr. M'Andrew dredged a few specimens off the coasts of Norway

and the former gave some interesting particulars of the animal, which I

have been able to confirm by my own observation. Although allied to P.

nivalis, and found in the same locality, it has distinct eyes placed on rather

prominent stalks or ommatophores, whereas P. nivalis has no eyes nor any

trace of eye-stalks. On this account Sars proposed the generic name Tiiphlo-

maagelia for the latter species ; but it must be borne in mind that Eulima

steiiostoma is also eyeless, and yet is closely related to its congeners and com-

panions, all of which have very conspicuous eyes. It is a somewhat remark-

able coincidence that the shell of E. stenosfoma resembles a large Achatina

acicula, which is in the same category as regards these so-called organs of

sight. The shells of P. carinata and P. nivalis are easily distinguishable.

   Among the rarer and more noteworthy moHusks procured this year were

the following:

Montacuta tumidida, St. Magnus Bay and near Fetlar. Described by me

from the Hebrides in the Repoi'ts of the Association for 1866.

AM. donacina, S. Wood.                                                                             single valve from deep water in St. Magniis

Bay. Another valve had been dredged by me at Falmouth in 1839. It is a

rare Coralline Crag fossil. Its nearest ally is M. suhstriata.

AUtriculus f/lobosiis, Loven.                                                                                  small living specimen occurred this year

also in St. Magnus Bay.

ACT. expansus, Jeffr.                                                                              few young specimens again in St. Magnus Bay.

Odostomia Warreni, Thompson. Never having seen this shell in a fresh

and perfect state, I considered it (Brit. Conch, iv. p. 143) a variety of 0.
ohliqua. But the discovery of hve specimens in St. Magnus Bay and near

Fetlar enables me to separate the two as distinct species. 0. Warreni has a

shorter spire and more swollen whorls than 0. ohliqua, the suture is deeper,
the striae are much stronger at the base of the shell, the whole surface is covered
with most delicate and close-set microscopic spiral lines, and the umbilicus

is well developed and deep. The animal of 0. Warreni has a peculiar foot

this is not plain and rounded at its extremity, as in 0. ohliqua, but is deeply

bilobed or forked like the tail of a swallow. No other species of Odostomia,
so far as I am aware, has a similar foot. One individual spun a fine gluti-

nous thread from the middle of the foot, and kept itself suspended for some

time from the surface of the water, with the point of the shell downwards. I

found a dead specimen of 0. ohliqua on the same ground with 0. Warreni.

A0. uinhilicaris, Malm.                                                                            young specimen from St. Magnus Bay, nearly

globular, and thus exhibiting the same distinctive characters as the adult.

Siphonodentalium Lofotense and Cadidus (or Loxoporns) suhfusiformis were

again found, the former being more widely distributed. Both inhabit the

Mediterranean                                                                            and  the  latter  is  a Sicilian and Viennese  fossil.  1 had an
                                                                                      :

excellent opportunity of observing them ahve and in active motion. The

thread-like and extensile organs by which the Solenoconchia seize their prey

are unlike the tentacles of any Gastropod, and their function is quite dif-

ferent. I would call these organs captaada, an appropriate word and not less

clas.«ically formed than tentacula.

   Leda pernv.la was dredged, as before, in St. Magnus Bay ; but with it was
a dead and apparently semifossil valve of Tellina calcaria. 1 must therefore
hesitate in considering the one more than the other recent or an inhabitant

of the British seas at the present time.

Perhaps Lamellaria prodita, Love'n, may be added to the list; but unfor-

tunately the specimen was handled too roughly, and the shell was crushed to

1868.                                                                                                                                            8

pieces. Its extraordinary size (considerably more than an inch in length)
and the depth (110 fathoms) at which it was dredged deserve notice.

    Being in the south of Europe last winter I had an opportunity of examin-
ing Mediterranean and Adriatic shells ; and the result greatly surprised as
well as interested me. The dredgings of Capt. Acton (the Commandant of the
Italian navy) in the Gidf of Naples, and the extensive collections of Dr. Tiberi
at Portici, General Stefanis at Naples, Herr Weinkauf from Algeria, and

of Dr. Brusina at Zara, especially yielded a vast quantity of new material

for a comparison of the marine testacea of the north and south of Europe.

Many of the species having been described (some insuiEcientty) under dif-

ferent names, the difficulty of identification is considerable ; but there is no
doubt that a remarkable concordance exists, and to a great extent, between
the moUusca which inhabit the deeper parts of the Atlantic and Mediterranean

--seas from 62° to 36° N. lat. The littoral kinds differ much more a cir-

cumstance which may have been occasioned by climatal conditions. To ex-

emplify the former proposition I subjoin a list of 76 species, usually considered

northern, which are common to the North Sea and the Mediterranean, with

their principal synonyms.

  How is this concordance to be accounted for ? I have carefully read again

Forbes's elaborate essay " On the Connexion between the distribution of the

existing Fauna and Flora of the British Isles, and the Geological changes
which have affected their area, especially during the epoch of the Northern
Drift " (Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Great Britain, vol. i. 1846) ; but
I cannot find in it a satisfactory solution of the question. He, indeed, men-
tions the continuance of some " arctic " species in the British seas, the rest
having " retired for ever," and that certain other species which he called
" Boreal or Celtic " occurred in a fossil state in Sicily ; and he states (p. 390)

that " in the deepest of the regions of depth in the ^gean " the same repre-
sentation of a northern fauna as exists in our own seas is maintained, " partly

by identical and partly by representative forms." The instances he gives do

not support such a view ; and I am not a believer in " representative forms."

He evidently was not aware of the fact that boreal (not arctic) species still

live in the Mediterranean. I, however, fully agree with him that at some
former period (which he designates "the newer pliocene epoch") there was
an open communication between the Atlantic (according to him the " North

Seas") and the Mediterranean, by which the fauna became diffused. I

should be inchned to place the Atlantic point of communication at Bordeaux,

and that of the Mediterranean at Narbonne, in the line of the Languedoc

                                                                                                                   so
                                                                           ;:

Canal, whicli extends from one coast to the other, and is very little above

the present level of the sea. This communication must have been very wide

and it remained open during the glacial epoch, which affected not only the

north of Europe, hut also Naples, Sicily, and probably Rhodes. Dr. Tiberi

showed me a fine valve of Pecten IslioirUcus which had lately been fished up

in the Gulf of Naples at a depth of 50 fathoms, and with it a valve of

P. opercularis quite as large as northern specimens ; both the valves were in
a semifossil state, and the former was covered with the same Greenland species

of Sjjirorbis (S. canreUafiis, Fabr.) as I noticed on valves of P. Ishmdicus

dredged in the Shetland seas at depths varpug from 75 to 170 fathoms.

Sir Charles Lyell has not adverted, in the last edition of his ' Principles of

Geology,' to the remarkable occurrence of such glacial fossils in the Shetland

sea-bed, to which I called the attention of geologists in my former Reports

as well as in the second volume of ' British Conchology,' p. 58 ; and he

seems to have overlooked the observations of Philippi and Seguenza on

the fossils of Calabria and Sicily, when he stated (Princ. Geol. i. p. 298) that

" deposits filled with arctic species of marine shells are to be seen in full force

on the North American continent ten or more degrees further south than in

Europe." Possibly he was misled by one of Forbes's conclusions (Rep. Geol.
Surv. p. 402), that " no glacial beds are known in Southern Europe." This,
however, was more than twenty years ago. I have myself identified from

the Calabrian and Sicilian deposits several high-uortliern shells (e. g. Tcre-

hratula cranium., T. septata, Lima e.vcavata, MytUua modiolus, Gijprina Islan-

dicn, Ml/a fruncata, var. UddevaUensis, Saxicava Norvegica, Puncturella Noa-

cJiina, Eiiiari/inula crassa, Buccinum unditum, and JViiticn offinis or clausa),
and from the Rhodian deposits Terehrattda septata and Lima Sarsii.

  My old companion, Mr. Waller, picked up on the b^ach in a small bay on

the west coast of Shetland a shell of Spirula aiistndis. It is a tropical

Cephalopod, and is not unfrequently thrown up by tlie waves on the southern

and western shores of England, Wales, and Ireland, together with exotic

species of Teredo, lanthina, and Hi/ahva brought from southern latitudes.

Dr. Morch informs me that several shells of the Spirida have this year been

found in the Faroe Isles. The transport of such tropical productions to

northern latitudes has been usnallj" attributed to the Gulf-stream. It now,

however, appears more probable that this is the consequence, not of the direct

action and course of the Gulf-stream, but of the prevalence of westerly and

south-westerly winds, which waft onwards to northci-n latitudes, in a north-

erly and north-easterly direction, the floating objects carried to a certain

distance by the Gulf-stream. The direct course of the Gulf-stream has not

been observed further north than about 45° N. lat. ; from that point it would

Aseem to dwindle into a north-castei'ly surface drift.  chart will shortly be

published by the Admiralty in explanation of this view of the case ; and the

following papers on the subject ought to be consulted by physical geographers

--Dr. Stark " On the Temperature of the Sea around the coasts of Scotland

during the years 1857 and 1858, and the bearing of the facts on the theoiy

that the mild climate of Great Britain during winter is dependent on the

Gulf-stream" (Trans. R. S. Edin. 1859), and Capt. Thomas's tables and re-

marks in Mr. Alex. Buchau's Report " On the Temperature of the Sea on

the Coast of Scotland '' (Journ. Scottish ileteor. Soc. Oct. 1865). See also

' Br. Conch.' vol. i. (Introd.) pp. xcviii and xcix.

  I will add a short summarj' of the observations recorded in my Reports on

Shetland dredgings and in the work last cited.
   1. The bathymetrical zones have been too much divided by Risso and sub-

sequent authors. There are two principal zones, littoral and submarine ; the
nature of the habitat and the supply of food influence the residence and mi-
                                            ;

gration of animals, not the comparative depth of water. Psammobia costu-
lata and Bucciniim undatitm are instances in support of this proposition.

    2. Specimens or varieties of the same species are larger in the littoral and
laminarian zones than in deeper water : e. g. Mactra soUdct and its variety
elliptica, Sohcurtus candklus, Pandora inceqidvaJvis and its variety ohtusa or
pinna, Chiton Javis, Tectura virghwi, Trochus zizyphinus, Pkurotoma Iceul-
gata, and Philine aperta.

    3. The size of North-European specimens is usually greater than that of
South-European specimens of the same species, e. g. Pecten septemradiatus,
P. opercidaris, Lima hians, Mijtdus Adriuticus, Isocardia cor, Astarte sulcata,
 Venus exoleta, V. lincta, Ttllina balaustina, Chiton Hanleyi, Tectara vircfinea,
Natica Alderi, Defrancia teres, D. purpurea, and BuUa utriculus.

    4. The coloiir of specimens from the greatest dejiths is not less vivid than
 of those from shallow water, although each zone has colourless specimens.

 Venus ovata, Trochus zizijphinus, Turritclla terehra, and Eulima hilineata may

be mentioned as examples. This was lately confirmed by a great authority,
 Professor Sars,who has given* numerous instances in illustration of it, founded
on his sou's drcdgings at depths varying from 250 to 300 fathoms among

the Loffoden Isles. The recent investigations of Dr. W. B. Carpenter and Pro-
fessor Wyville Thomson in the North Atlantic, by means of the dredge, at
 much greater depths show also tliat the shells there procured (e. g. Venus ovata

 and Columhella haliceeti) were liighly coloured and variegated. In the ' Bul-

letin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology ' at Harvard College, Cambridge,
 U.S., for ISliS, wiU be found an interesting paper by Count L. F. Pourtales,
 entitled "Contributions to the Fauna of the Gulf-stream at great depths."
He says that at the greatest depths which he explored, reaching to .517 fathoms,

 " the prevaihng colours are white, pink, sometimes playing into orange, and a

pale green. Blue was only seen in a small encrusting sponge." And he

 further remarks that " the deep-sea animals have generally well- developed

 eyes, larger, if anything, than those of their congeners of shallow water."
     5. Mollusca inhabiting deep water have a larger supply of oxygen for the

 aeration of their gills than those which Uve in shallow water. See my account

 of Columhella haliceeti.

     6. The occurrence of the same species in the North Sea and the Mediter-
 ranean results partly from former geological or cosmical conditions, and partly
 from a communication which once existed between the Bay of Biscay and the
 Gulf of Lyons.

     7. Oceanic or floating shells of exotic species are carried northwards by west-
 erly winds, and not directly by the Gulf-stream,which does not reach our coasts.

     8. Land and freshwater mollusca are scarce in Shetland, owing to the
 scantiness of succulent vegetation for their food, and of lime for the con-
 struction of their shells. These are smaller than southern specimens ; and
 the same fact is observable with respect to Shetland insects.

      9. Semifossil shells of arctic species (such as Pecten Islandicus, Tellina

 calcaria, Mya truncafa, yar. Uddevallensis, MolJeria costulata, Trochus cinereus,

 and Trophon clathratus) are met with on the sea-bottom at considerable
 depths, and at some chstance from land. The only explanation I can offer is
 a former elevation of the sea-bed whereon these moUusks lived (and which
 was probably in shallow water), its conversion into dry land, and a subsequent
 subsidence. Perhaps the sea-bed is still sinking.

     10. Species recorded from the Coralline Crag and earlier deposits, and sup-

 posed to be extinct, have now been discovered Hving in the Shetland seas
 e. g. Limopsis aurita, Phurotoma carinata, and Columhella hcdiceeti. Possibly

238 REPORT 1868.

TrocJms amahilis is another case, assuming that it originated from Margarita ?
nuieulata of Searles Wood.

    Professor Dickie has been good enough to report on some Diatoms from
the insides of a quantity of Eclnnus Norvegicus, which were dredged at a depth

of 78 fathoms about forty miles from the east coast of Shetland. He says

they are chiefly Navintla dld>/ma, Coscinod iseus excentricus, C. 7n!»or, Acti-

nocgclus imdidatus, and MeJosira sidcata, with fewer of M. mimmulotdes and

Nitzschia angulans, all marine; also a few freshwater Cocconemalanceolatum,

SurireUa minuta, and fragments of a Pinnidaria. And he adds that long ago

he recorded the occurrence of freshwater Diatomaceaj mixed with marine
species from the stomachs of Aseidice taken in deep water off Aberdeen. The
freshwater Diatoms must evidently have been carried by a stream into the sea,
and transported by the tide to the place where they sunk to the bottom, and
were swallowed by the indiscriminating Echini and Ascidice. Diatoms inhabit
the surface only of the water, and Ghhigerina and other Foraminifera not of

a fixed or sessile nature have been observed by Major Owen and myself
to float when alive within a few inches from the surface. Dr. Wallich foimd

the microscopic organisms which he called coccospheres " profusely in a living,
or perhaps it would be more safe to say a recent, condition in material col-
lected at the surface of the open seas of the tropics." Coccospheres and free
Foraminifera cover the bed of the Atlantic at enormous depths. The occur-
rence, therefore, of such organisms on the floor of the ocean at such depths
docs not prove that they ever lived there. I should rather be inchned to

believe that they dropped to the bottom of the sea when dead or after having

passed through the stomachs of other animals which had fed on them.

  A few small fishes were caught in the dredge at depths of from 90 to 100

fathoms. Dr. Giinther reports that they belong to the undermentioned spe-
cies: Callionymus maculatus (Bonap.), Gohius Jeffreysii (Giinth.), young,
Ci/clojiterus lumptis (L.), young, Lejjadogaster himacidatus (Penn.), and

Rhombus Norvegicus (Giinth.), young. He remarks that the last-named
species is new to the British fauna, having been hitherto known from the

coast of Norway only.
   Mr. Norman will report on the Cmstacea, Tunicata, Polyzoa, Hydrozoa,

Echinoderms, Actinozoa, and Sponges, Dr. M'Intosh on the Annelids, and
Mr. Waller on the Foraminifera.
 Mollusca inhabiting the Shetland Isles and the adjacent seas. (See Tables

dibranchs is very little known. For the preparation of the present list of

Nudibranchs I am in a great measure indebted to the late Mr. Alder and to

--Shetland Final Dredging Report. Part II. On the Crustacea, Tuni-

   cata, Pokjzoa, Echinodermata, Adinozoa, Hydrozoa, and Porifera.

   By the Rev. Alfred Merle Norman, M.A.

The especial object with which the Shetland dredging was recently under-

taken, under the auspices of the British Association, was the examination of
the fauna of the deep water which surrounds that most northern group of
our islands. The abyss of the sea there approaches near to land at a depth
rapidly descending to eighty or one hundred, and subsequently reaching
many hundred fathoms. The sea-bottom at such a depth would never have
been laid bare during those two great upheavals of the earth's surface which
appear to have been the last great geological oscillations over the area of the

north-west of Europe. At a time when all the channels and sea which now

separate our islands from each other, and from the rest of Europe, were raised
high and dry above the level of the ocean, and the whole formed part of one
great continent, the sea, if the calculations as to the extent of that elevation are

a aything like the truth, must still have broken on the rocky shores of the
218 REPORT--18G8.

imposingly bold promontory of Slietland, and the forefathers of at least a large
proportion of its present inhabitants must have lived and died in the same

spots which thej- now occupy.
   Before the recent investigation was commenced, the dredgings of Mr.

Jeffreys and the late Mr. Earlee had resulted in procuring many northern

species of Mollusca in Shetland, which were not before supposed to range
so far south. Moreover, the long lines of the Haaf fishermen had brought

up some strangers from the deep, and had made known to Jameson,

Fleming, and others the existence of a fauna of a widely different character
from that of other portions of the British coast. Lastly, the cruise of Mr.
M' Andrew's yacht enabled the late Professor E. Forbes to acquaint himself

with many Echinodermata and other animals of peculiar interest. These
combined circumstances made us anxious that the invertebrata of this

portion of our islands should be thoroughly investigated, and led to the
appointment by the British Association of a Committee to prosecute such

researches. It is only right, however, that it should be known that the
money which has from time to time been voted by the Association to this

Committee has only consisted of grants in aid*. Dredging in the open waters
of the Atlantic at considerable distances from land necessitates the employment
of a vessel of some size, and consequently entails a not inconsiderable outlay.

That outlay has been mainly borne by Mr. Jeffreys, who has been the leader

in the whole undertaking. Mr. Leckenljy, of Scarborough, has also contributed

largely towards the expenses ; and other members of the Committee, who have
taken part in the expeditions, have similai'ly aided, if in much smaller sums,
at least not less willingly in proportion to their means. But my object in
referring to this matter is to let it be known that the light which is now

thrown upon the fauna of this portion of our seas, together with any value

M'hich this present lieport may possess, is chiefly due to the liberality in the

cause of science of the two naturalists whose names have been mentioned.
   The marine fauna of Shetland has now been proved to be extremely rich.

The sea there would seem to be in an especial manner the meeting-place of

northern and southern types. Many arctic forms not known further to the

south are here found associated with numerous Mediterranean species which
do not reach the Scandinavian coast, and some of which are remarkable as
not having as yet been found at any intermediate habitat between the ex-
treme south of Europe and ShetLand.

   The distribution of animal life around our coasts appears for the most part,
to have followed the direction south, west, north, east. It would seem that
comparatively very few (if any) southern species have made their way far
north through the straits of Dover, which may probably be accounted for by
the fact that that channel has, geologically speaking, been only a short time
open. As a rule southern species are to be seen at a higher latitude on the
western than they are on the eastern coasts. There are, liowcvei", some
apparent, but only apparent, exceptions. These consist of animals known
on the north-east coast of Scotland, which we should not have expected to
meet with there. On examining into the probable cause of their migration to

tills district, I am led to believe that they have made their way thither round

the western and northern, and down the eastern coasts to their present habitats,
and not up the eastern coast as might at first have been supposed. For ex-

ample, Cerithium perversum, PhasianeUt pulla, Fissurclla Grceca, TeMlna ha-

   * The dredging of the first two years here reported on (1861 and 1862) was carried on

have been found in the Moray Firth, but are wholly unknown on the eastern

coast of England. Moreover, many species have been recorded on the Nor-

wegian coast, though never found on the eastern shores of England, and

therefore may be presumed to have migrated thither up the western side of

Great Britain and round the north of Scotland ; as exam2Jles of such species

may be cited Phurotoma stnolnta, attenuata, and sej)tanfinlaris, Cevithiopsis

tubercularis, CerWiium reticulatum and perversum, liissoa violacea, Pholas

dactylus, Solen vagitut, Psammohia costulata, Gastrana fragilts, Isocardia cor,

Cardimn aculeatum, Lepton squamosum, XantJio rivulosus, Portunus arcuaius,

Gebia deltura, &c. On the other hand, while northern forms do not extend

southward on the east coast beyond Yorkshire and the Dogger Bank, on the

w^estern coasts they in many instances have a range southwards to the
Nymph Bank, off Cork, and even to the Mediterranean sea. Inasmuch,

therefore, as migration northwards has for the most part taken place by way

of the Hebrides and Shetland, a southern form which may be found in

the Gulf of Christiania or neighbouring part of Scandinavia, though at a point

of latitude considerably fiu'ther to the south than Shetland, may be regarded

practically with respect to distribution to be further north, and a northern

species at Shetland as further soiith in its course of migration. In the pre-

paration, therefore, of the Tables IV. and VII. I have regarded the whole of

the Scandinavian sea as though it was to the north of Shetland, notwith-

standing that the latter is geographically situated in about the same latitude

as Bergen.

As has been already stated, the chief aim of the Dredging Committee was

to thoroughly examine the invertcbrata of the deep sea. This purpose was

never lost sight of, and the ch-edgo was rarely let down in the Voes or other

shallow water except when we were driven there by stress of weather ; nor
was it possible to find much leisure, amid the constant labour entailed by the

examination and preparation of the animals procured by the dredge, to devote

to the littoral zone. Notwithstanding, therefore, the great length of the pre-

sent catalogue (which shows the fauna in almost every branch to be more

rich than that of any other portion of the British coast which has been care-

fully examined by competent naturalists) there cannot be a question that

numerous and interesting discoveries will reward the future investigations of

zoologists near the shore as well as in the open sea. Eor with regard to the

latter, our repeated dredgings in these northern waters have only sent us

home each time more fully convinced how much remains to be done before

we can attain anything like a complete knowledge of the animals which

Weinhabit them.  never tried a new locality a few miles distant from that

which we were before examining that we did not meet with species which

had been pre^4ously unnoticed : in fact the Shetland seas appear to afford an

inexhaustible treasury of rare animals iji every department of zoology.

"While some species are extremely widely diffused, though numerically

scarce, throughout the province, others are common everywhere, and others

again apparently excessively limited in their distribution as well as very rare

when found. But one of the most remarkable features in the distribution of

life in the Shetland Sea is the extraordinarily circumscribed habitat, but at

the same time the local profusion, of many species. It will not be without
interest to give a few examples of this. Many Crustacea, as Nika edulis,

Doryphorus Gordoni, Gastrosacciis sancfus, &c., occurred on one occasion in

one spot in considerable numbers, but were scarcely ever (if ever) seen again.

Forty miles east of the Whalsey Skerries Echinus Norvegicus was in such

extraordinary profusion that the dredge came up again and again literally
almost filled with it ; but though occurring in many other localities, it was,

--250 REPORT 1868.

 save in this one instance, comparatively uncommon. Near the same spot
 Antedon Sarsii was brought iip in thousands, yet, except in that one day's

 dredging, I never was fortunate enough to meet with the species. In this
 same neighbourhood Ophiura Sarsii was found very abundantly, but it was

 scarcely ever seen again during these dredgings. Cidaris papiJlata and
 Spatangus meridiomdis appeared to be confined to one limited area to the
 north of Unst, yet there they were to be met with in considerable numbers.
 Similarly Tealia digitata was chiefly found in one particular spot ; and
 the same is true of Ascidia ohliqua, A. sordida, Escliara lorea and Icevis,

  Cellepora attenuatci, Tessarodoma gracile, Pahnicellaria elegans, Hornera ho-

 realis and violacea, Zoanthus pajnUosus, Sidisia Barleeii, Fennatvla flios-
phorea, Tubularia attenuata, Quasillina hrevis, PhakeUia rohusta, Isodictya

Jlmbriata, Oceanapia Jeffreijsii, &c., all of which, though dredged occasion-

 ally elsewhere, were chiefly to be found in one circumscribed area, where
 they appeared to be very common, and in some instances to live in the most
 astounding quantities. MTien cases of remarkable local distribution occur in

 channels or bays the circumstance is not unexpected, but it is diff"erent when
 we are dredging in the wide expanse of the Atlantic with apparently no
 causes at work to make such differences in the nature of the sea-bottom,
 which around Shetland is in general of nearly uniform though gradually
 increasing depth, as would render different positions peculiarly fitted for the
life of different species. Yet this would seem in a most marked degree to
be the case. The nature of the sea-bed on the Haaf is continually changing,
and the character of the inhabitants varies with it. At one moment the

dredge is scraping over hard stony ground calculated to tear the nets to
pieces, at the next it is sunk deep in fine sand or in an unctuous mud.

When the dredge is hauled up it will be often found that while down it has

at fijst travelled over a soft bottom and thence brought up in the sand some
 extremely interestiag species, perhaps in profusion, while subsequently it has
been dragged over hard ground and the stones which it has thence collected
have crushed to pieces the delicate organisms which lay below them in the

--net. "We at once tack and endeavour again to strike the spot where we had

first let down the dredge no easy matter certainly in the open sea, where no
bearings can be taken from the land; the whole day is spent, perhaps many

days are spent, in the search for that spot, but Ulocyathus arcticus or Troclms

amahilis decUnes again to show us its pretty face.

   It may be well to mention that the term " Haaf," which constantly occurs

in this Eeport, means the open sen, and the Shetland fishermen, more espe-

cially those of the "Out" or " Whalsey Skerries," speak of the "inner,"

" middle," or " outer Haaf," according to the distance of the fishing-ground

from land. The " outer Haaf" to the east of the Whalsey Skerries is about

forty miles from those rocky islets, and fifty-five or sixty miles from the
mainland.

    In the catalogue of species which follows in this Eeport I have, in the case
of those animals which have only occiu-red once, generally appended the date
of the year in which they were discovered. The following account of the
naturalists who accompanied the expeditions in the different years will enable

the reader to assign the credit of each discovery to the right "persons. Many
invertebrata which were preserved during the years when I was not myself

present with the Committee, and belong to the classes on which I report,

were kindly placed in my hands by Mr. Jeffreys. In the notes which foUow,

the specimens having been actually examined by myself, I hold myself
responsible for the correctness of the identification "of the species in aU cases,
except where the locality or note is contained within inverted commas, where

the determination of the species rests upon the authority of the naturalist
whose name follows the quotation.

proved so productive. Vessel, the yacht ' Osprey.'

1862. Mr. Jeffreys and Professor Allman. The expedition came to a pre-

mature and unfortunate termination. The vessel which had been chartered,

having been caught in a heavy gale at sea, had her rudder-post carried

away, and thus became disabled. Professor Allman, however, succeeded in

procuiing several Hydrozoa new to science.

A1863. Mr. Jeffreys, Mr. Waller, Mr. R. Dawson, and myself.  steamer

was this year engaged in the work, find the dredging was in the directions

north, north-east, and east of Unst.

1864. Mr. Jeffreys, Mr. Waller, and Mr. Peach. The dredging was chiefly

carried on to the north of Unst, Balta Soimd being made the headquarters

during the greater portion of the summer. Mr. Peach paid special attention

to the sponges, and discovered several new species. Vessel, the ' Osprey.'

1867. Mr. Jeffreys, Mr. Waller, Mr. Dodd, and myself. The bed of the

ocean, to the north and west of Shetland, was investigated, and at greater

Adepths than had before been tried.    fortnight was also spent in examin-

ing the rich fauna of the deeper parts of St. Magnus Bay. Vessel, Mr.

Jeffreys's yacht the ' Osprey.'

1868. Mr. Jeffreys, Mr. Waller, and Major Woodall. Dredging chiefly

to the north of Unst and St. Magnus Bay, but the Out Skerries Haaf was

also visited. Vessel, the ' Osprey.'

  My sincere thanks are especially due to my kind and valued friends Mr.

Jeffreys and Mr. Waller, for the assistance they rendered me in all kinds of

ways during our dredging operations, and in the preservation of those inver-

tebrata which it is my duty here to notice.

   In 1867 Mr. D. Eobertson went to Shetland, and, besides dredging and
using the towing-net in Bressay Sound, he visited many of the inland lochs

and streams, for the purpose of examining the Crustacea which they might

contain. I have to thank him for having kindly allowed me to examine
the gatherings which he made, and I am thus enabled to add many species

to the hst of Entomostraca.

In the preparation of the Tables which follow, it must be understood

Athat I have not relied solely on published locaHties.  large number of the

species have been identified by myself from habitats further to the north or

to the south than those which have been recorded in print. This will

account for the absence of many names from the Tables IV., V., and VII.

which might have been expected there.

      Comparison of the Total Number of British and of Shetland Species,

   The following Table is intended to show
    1. The number of species belonging to the several Classes and Orders, as
given in the " List of the British Marine Invertebrate Fauna," published by
the British Association in 1861, and which supplies us with a carefully cor-
rected catalogue of the species known seven years ago.
    2. The total number of species which have been recorded as British up to
the time of publication of -this Report. This estimate I have "drawn up

of British species now known, and those which had been recognized previ-

ously to 1861, is even greater than appears from a comparison of the figures

here inserted.

   3. The number of species which have been found in the Shetland seas.
The inland forms are entirely omitted from these columns. The small area of

the Shetland Islands, their isolation, the stunted character of the vegetation,
the almost total absence of trees, and the scarcity of ponds or pieces of
water other than moorland tarns (which character of water has a restricted
fauna peculiarly its own), all tend to limit the numbers of land and fresh-

water invertebrata Ukely to be found in the islands. Our object was the
investigation of the marine fauna, and but little attention was paid to that
of the land. Those few species, however, which were observed wiU be found
enumerated in the Catalogue, and consist of twenty-two Crustacea (out of
one hundred and fifteen known as British) and one Hydrozoon.

   No really satisfactory comparison can be made bet^veen the nnmber of

animals hero reported on as inhabiting the Shetland Sea with those found on
other portions of our coast. Unfortunately very little attention has hitherto
been paid to any, except the larger and more conspicuous forms belonging to

these classes. In order, however, that this comparison may be carried out as

far as at present practicable, I give the following summaries of the most fully

worked up local lists that I am acquainted with.

   The only local List of Sponges is one recently published by Mr. E. Parfitt,

" On the Marine and Freshwater Sponges of Devonshire " (Trans. Devonshire

Association for the Advancement of Science, Literature, and Art, 1868) ; it
includes forty-nine marine species, while the Shetland species observed by us
are eighty-three. Only eighteen of these species are as yet known to be
common to these two extremities of our islands.

          Species added to the British Fauna during the recent Dredging.

   The new species which have during the past six years been discovered in

Shetland have from time to time been published through various channels, a
large proportion of them having been placed in the hands of those naturalists

who were engaged in biinging out works on the several branches of marine
zoology. The following list of 156 species is therefore given here in order to
show at a glance the additions to our fauna which have directly resulted from

the investigations of the Dredging Committee.

  Mediterranean Species which occur in Shetland, hut have not been found at

                                                  intermediate localities.

   Two large and conspicuous animals, Portunus tuherculatus, E.oitx, and

Spatangus meridionalis, Hisso, have been found abundantly in these dredgings
at a depth, from eighty to one hundi'ed and forty fathoms. They are well

known in the south of Europe, but were supposed up to the time of their

discovery in Shetland not to occur north of the Mediterranean. It is not

nnlikely that Pagurus tricarinatus, Norman, will also prove to be a deep-
water Mediterranean form. All deep-water dredging seems to establish this
fact more clearly, that deep-water species have a much more extended geo-
graphical range than shallow-water and littoral forms. These Mediterranean
species must have made their way northwards in the abyss of the sea round
the western coast of Ireland, in which locality they will doubtless at some

future day be found. The classes on which it is my lot to report have been

so much neglected, and our knowledge therefore of their distribution is at
present so extremely limited, that it is at present impossible to draw any
satisfactory conclusions as to their range ; but I feel satisfied that when
hereafter fuUer and more accurate investigation shall have been carried on
both in the Mediterranean and our own coasts, not only will the number of
species common to the two extremities of Eui'ope be found to be much greater
than is now generally supposed, but also that a very large proportion of such
species will prove to be forms which will be met with in the depths of the

Mediterranean and of the seas to the west and north of our country, but
which will be found to be absent from the channels which intersect and the
shallower water which immediately surrounds our islands. Meanwhile the
occurrence of Portunus tuherculatus and Spatangus meridionalis is of excessive
interest, as such fine and handsome species could not have been well over-
looked, or have failed to attract attention in any portion of the sea which
has been at all efiiciently dredged*.

    The contents of the three Tables (lY., V., and YI.) added together give the

   * The following uorthern Mollusca have been identified by Mr. Jeifrejs from the
Mediterranean, but are not known elsewhere south of the nortli of Scotland or Shetland
Sea: Pecten aratiis, P. vitreus, Lima Sai-sii, Leda pi/gmcea, Scissurella crispata, Aclis

Walleri, Cerifhium metula, &c. ; the occurrence also of the following in the Mediterranean
is very unexpected : Terebratula caput-serpentis, Crania anomala, Pecten septemradiatus,
Axinus Croulinensis, Chiton Hanleyi, Propilidiiun ancyloides, Bissoa abyssicola, Scalaria
Trevelyana, Odostomia Scillce, Bulla utriculus, &c.

VIII.

         Species peculiarlij cliaracteristic of the Fauna of the Outer Hacf.

   The following list gives the species which impart a peculiar chai'acter to
the fauna of the deep sea of Shetland, known as the " Outer Haaf,'' in a
depth of 80-170 fathoms. The MoUuscan inhahitants of this region are

highly interesting, but it is not within my province here to speak of them.

Crustacea are few in numbers, Portunus tuherculaius, Munida, two or three
species of Crangon, Pandalus hrevirostris, Cknnacea, Ampelisca, and Epimeria
trkristata being the most abundant. Echinodermata are abundant, and cer-
tain species sometimes in the most extraordinary profusion. Polyzoa and
Sponges are very abundant, but of Coelentcrata there are but few species;
those species which do occur belong, for the most part, to the Zoantharia.
Carijophyllia Smifhii var. horealis is found inhabiting these depths in
marvellous abiindance ; Zoanthus anguicoma is common, creeping over
Sponges from the greatest depths, and an occasional Bulocera eques or
Tuedia, or a noble Ulocyathus arcticus presents itself to our admiring gaze.
Very few Tunicata occur below seventy fathoms.

   The names which follow are of the most abundant or, at any rate, more
conspicuous species ; the list might, had I so wished, have been greatly

extended.

   There is no text-book which embraces all the orders of Crustacea, and
which can be followed in this class. Even for the separate orders few

the earlier names  under which  the  species was described                                                                                           and moreover so

advanced during the last few years that, of the seventy-eight species of this

subclass here recorded, no less than thirty-one are undescribed in the

work referred to. In the Amphipoda and Isopoda I have followed the

general arrangement of the recently published work upon ' The British Ses-

sile-eyed Crustacea,' by Messrs. Bate and Westwood. In the Ostracoda, two

admirable  guides  exist  in  Herr  G. 0. Sars's                       * Oversigt  af Norges                                                         marine

derived great assistance from Dr. Claus's ' Die frei-lebenden Copepoden,' and

from the smaller memoirs by the same author. Descriptions of most of

the remaining species in the following catalogue must be sought in the

Portunus piistuhttits, Norman, Brit. Assoc. Rept. 1861 (1862), p. 151.

This fine addition to our fauna was first procured by me in 1861, and

has been taken every year since. It is the most abundant of the genus

in the Shetland seas, living in 80-120 fathoms. The fact of this fine

Mediterranean species occurring in the deep Shetland seas, in company
with many other southern forms, which are not known in intermediate

localities between the Mediterranean and the most northern portion of

the seas, is highly interesting. Portunus tuhercidatus is distinguished
by its tubercular, pustulose carapace, by the acuteness of the latero-

anterior teeth, and the great size of the posterior tooth, which is double

the length of the preceding ones, and by the last legs having the swim-

ming-blade furnished with a raised median line.

carpus nearly smooth above, but having a few slender porrected spines

on the distant margin, below (as well as succeeding joints) tuberculate

wrist spinosely tuberculate ; hand ovate, broad, with three much raised

keels, one median and two lateral, which are denticulate on the crest

surface of hand, in the hollow between the keels, tuberculate ; finger

broad, flattened, having the outer margin covered with much elevated

tubercles. Left hand and wrist narrow, pinched up (as in P. puhescens)

into a spine-crowned keel ; outer margin of hand with a row of spines.

First two pair of walking legs having the tipper margin spined. All

the limbs slightly hispid, the hairs more especially developed on the left

cheliped. Length 1| inch. Three examples ch-edged in deep water

in 1867.

There are two Mediterranean species to which this fine Pagurus

closely approaches, Pagurus angulntus. Risso, and Pagurus meticulosus,

Roux. The figures of the former would well accord with P. tricari-

natus, were it not that the keels of the hand are smooth instead of

strongly tuberculate ; and the latter appears to differ from oiu- Shet-

land form in the more elongated hands. It is, however, not improbable

that the Pagurus here described may hereafter prove to belong to one

of these southern species.

spine on external margin, that spine (in both sexes) at about three-

fifths of the distance from the base to the extremity. Eyes on long

stalks, which project beyond sides of carapace. Inner margin of inner

uropods with a dense ci'owded row of unequal-sized spines, so closely

packed as to touch each other at their bases. Male having the sexual

lobe of superior antennas much shorter than the peduncle ; the fourth

foot of pleon mth the first three joints subequal in length, and the last

joint subequal to the fourth.

narrow, and of nearly equal breadth throughout, nearly half as long

again as the inner. The male has the sexual lobe of the superior

antennae unusually long, as long as the whole peduncle. The antennal

scale is narrower than in the female, the spine nearer the apex than

the base, and the breadth not greater at that point than nearer the

base. The fourth foot of pleon is very long, and reaches beyond the

telson ; the outer branch very Kke that of M. spiritus, but the third
joint is much longer than either of the two first, which are subequal

notch on each side of the front margin of carapace opposite the centre

of the insertion of the eye. Superior antennae with peduncle twice as

long as the eye-stalk ; first joint long, slender, very concave above, two

following much thicker, the third double the length of the second,

hispid like the body. Inferior antennas with peduncle only reaching

the extremity of the penultimate joint of the superior ; scale pro-

duced, slenderly subulate, nearly twice as long as peduncle of superior

antenme (somewhat less in c7 ), two-jointed, second joint one-third

second, third, fifth, or seventh) with smaller spines, the rounded entire

apex terminating in four spines, the outer pair much longer than the

middle pair ; on examining the telson from helow, it is seen to form,
for about half its length, an open tube, the opening consisting of a
central slit, the margins of which are edged with small spines. Interior
lamellae swollen at the base for the reception of the acoustic organ, but
afterwards very narrow, slightly longer than telson. Outer lamellae
remarkably long and very narrow, fully half as long again as inner
pair ; both mai-gius of both pairs fringed throughout with long plumose
setae ; inner margin of inner lamellae also closely beset with spines,
which are of unequal size.

    In the male, the superior antennae have the last joint of the pedun-
cle furnished with the usual lobe and dense tuft of hair. All the pleo-
pods have a stout, large basal joint, which gives support to two branches,
the inner of Avhich in the last four pair is multiarticulate and setose,
and gives off, close to the base, a small lateral lobe terminating in short
setae, but in the first pair the inner branch is rudimentary. The outer
branch in the first three and the last pair is also multiarticulate and
setose, but in the fourth pair is a more complicated organ, and consists
of six joints at the base, all furnished on each side with a long plumose
seta, and two branches of equal length, one slender, one-jointed, of

equal thickness throughout, ciliate, the other having a much stouter

basal joint and two miiltiarticulate ciliated filaments.

ments of pleon furnished with well-developed biramous pleopods. I am

by no means certain that the present species is not the male of Iphinoe

trispinosa. Undoubted males of that species resemble the I. gracilis
very closely, except that they have 2-3 spines on carapace, and the

pleopods have not the long plumose setae which adorn those of the latter

species. It is possible, however, that the development of these setae

may depend upon age, and that the presence or absence of the small

dorsal spines may not constitute more than varietal distinction. Future

observation must be left to clear up this point.

keeled carapace. Only iowv segments of pereion are exposed, and the

penultimate and the antepenultimate of these are raised into a rounded

rib across the back. The uropods have both branches two-jointed, and

only half as long as peduncle, subequal to each other, inner with nume-

rous short blunt spines, but the two distal ones of each joint long, outer

with plumose setse on the inner margin peduncle without spines or

with the present species in having a serrated palm to the second

at the distal extremity of the palm, in the wrist not being produced,

and in the anterior margin of the last pair of pereiopods being serrated.

   This Anonyx, the specimens agreeing in all respects with Spitzber-
gen examples, received from Prof. Loven, except that they are not more
than a quarter the size, was procured on the Out Skerries Middle Haaf,

in 1861. It occurred in hundreds upon a fish which had been brought up
dead on a fisherman's long line. It would appear to be one of the

scavengers of the seas ; for Goes also writes of it, " Ad Spetsbergiam

inter algas, prtesertim fundo arenoso et argillaceo profunditate orgyarum
trium usque ad sexaginta copia stiipeuda, eo ut, si perite ac prudenter in
captura versaris, hos pelagi voracissimos vespellones molibus milliariis
cadavere avium vel phocarum brevi e fundo elicere potes." The contour
of this Anonyx is peculiarly rouuded and smooth, by which character it
may, without microscopic examination of the limbs, be distinguished

from lonyipes. It is now first added to our fauna.

   Head produced, obliquely truncate in front, the antenna? attached to

the oblique truncation and directed downwards. Superior antennaj

about equal in length to peduncle of inferior ; second joint of peduncle

much more slender than first ; third joint scarcely differing in size or

length from the joints of the filament, rather more than half length of

second. Inferior antennoe with last two joints subequal, very long and

slender ; filament very long and slender ; antenna? speckled with red.

Nail of fii'st two pairs of pereiopoda longer than two preceding joints

combined. Last pereiopods having the posterior lobe of the basos pro-

duced downwards to the distal extremity of the following joint,

rounded inferiorly; meros not posteally produced; propodos and nail

      ment of pleon not produced. Last uropods much longer than preceding

        pairs ; branches about half as long again as peduncle. Telson cleft nearly

       to the base, equal in length to the penultimate uropods, and reaching
       to one-third the length of the rami of the last pair.

       A smaller species than the last, distinguished by the oblique truncation

       of the extremity of the head, and by the slenderness of the antennae, and

        their great difference in length. It is usually prettUy painted with hlac

       or rose-colour about the lower jjarts. Shetland, Skye, Guernsey (A.M.N. ),

       the kindness of Professor Loven, of comparing the individuals here de-
       scribed of this species and of A. Icevigata with Bohusliin examples, and

      thus am enabled to speak positively as to their identity.

          Head vertically truncate. Superior autennas a little longer than

        peduncle of inferior; peduncle reaching middle of penultimate joint of

        peduncle of inferior; second joint scarcely longer than first; thii'd joint
        about one-third as long as second ; lower side of whole peduncle beset
       with numerous transverse tufts of short hair; first joint of filament
       larger than usual, looking more like a joint of the peduncle, furnished
       below with a bunch of (? auditory) seta;. Inferior antennoe extremely
        long, equalling whole length of animal; upper margin of peduncle
        clothed with transverse rows of tufted hair, similar to those on lower

        side of superior antennae ; last joint nearly half as long again as penul-
       timate ; filament very slender. Nails of first two pairs of pereiopoda not

      longer than two preceding joints combined. Two last segments of pleon

        (fifth and sixth are coalesced into one) elevated dorsaUy into very con-
        spicuous humps. In other respects agreeing closely with A. eequicornis,
        of which species I strongly suspect that it is the male. Shetland

           The species described by British authors as A. Gahnardi is unques-
        tionably the A. carinata of Bruzelius ; the true A. Gaimardi, according
        to that author's characters, differs from all British forms in the structure
        of the last uropods and telson. " Pedes abdominis ultimi paris duo

       of this species ; but the females of this and of the next species are so
      very much alike as to be almost undistinguishable.

   The figure in the ' Brit. Sessile-eyed Crustacea ' of Microdeutopus gryl-

strong tooth-like process of the carpus of the first gnathopods is itself

fui'nished with a secondary (lateral) tooth ; and the hand is much nar-

rower at the base than at the apex, the posterior margin being concave

this state is well represented by Bruzelius, pi. i. fig. 4, d. The female

is extremely like that of the last species, and is sufficiently Avell repre-

sented at p. 293, Brit. Sessile-eyed Crust. ; though, for reasons already

stated, I incline to think tliat that figure really is drawn from the female

talpa of Costa (Iticerche sui Crostacoi Amfiji. del regno di Napoli,

forAvard to not quite half the length of the hand ; hand as wide or wider

Specimens from Bressay Sound have a deep brown broad band across

the pereion ; and in company with them were otlier specimens similarly

marked, and agreeing in general characters, but with gnathopods of

totally different structure. These I take to be the females. They so

closely resemljla the females of Aora c/raciUs and Mlcrodeuteropux ano-

malus that one description would suffice for all. Also taken among

Laminarire in St. Magnus Bay and on the Haaf. I question whether

there arc sufficient grounds for separating the genus Aora from Micro-

Wedenteropus.                                                                have seen that the females of two are almost undis-

tooth-like projection proceeds from the meros and not the carpus, 31.

Websterii must in justice have a similar distinction conferred upon it,

because in that species the tooth-like projection does not spring from

either meros or carpus, but from the hand.

closely against the hand, which it nearly equals in length. Second

gnathopods in general character ver}' Hke the first, but the propodos

somewhat broader and longer (as long as carpus), with two or three

longitudinal rows of hairs in place of the spines of the first pair, and

the finger only about half its length. Bases of the anterior pairs of

pereiopods of somewhat twisted form, the front margin armed with

several (5-6) strong spines. All the uropods subequal in length, bear-

ing tlie same general characters as in the genus Microdeuteropus.

ATelson tubular. Length a third of an inch.                         single specimen pro-

Pi-otomedeia pcctinata, u. sp. Superior antennae with second joint of peduncle

      subequal in length to but much more slender than first, last joint two-

thirds length of second ; filament sHghtly longer than i)eduncle, con-

sisting of about ten long articulations ; secondary appendage two-jointed,
scarcely longer than first articulation of filament. Inferior antenna}

subpediform, short ; filament not longer than last joint of peduncle.

Pirst gnathopods having basos fringed anteriorly with a few scattered

long seta3 ; ischium having a postero-distal dense tuft of long setae

nieros, carpus, and propodos all posteriorly thickly clothed with rather

long seta;, the last two subequal in length, the propodos oblong, sirb-

parallel sided, twice as long as broad, distaUy truncate ; finger strong,

much longer than the truncated extremity of propodos, not internally

serrate (as in $ of Microdeuteropus verslculatus, which this species re-

sembles in general structui'c of first gnathopods), but furnished with a

single large spine on the inner edge near the apex. Second gnathopods

having basos long (equal in length to four succeeding joints), posteriorly

straight, anteriorly convex, and furnished with two rows (one on edge

and the other a little within it) of very long slender seta;, arranged in a

comb-like manner ; ischium and meros narrower than carpus ; carpus

narrow, only slightly widening distally propodos subequal in length to
                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

fringed with long seta?, those of the anterior side the longer; finger

long, narrow, of equal thickness throughout, more than half as long as

propodos, not unguiculate, nor capable of being bent back upon the pro-

podos ; the blunt distal extremity tenuinated by two or three setae.
First pereiopods not liaving the meros anteriorly produced ; finger very

long and slender, subequal to propodos, and much longer than carpus.

Last pereiopods with hinder margin of basos not serrated, furnished with

a row of distant setce, which take their origin from some little distance

within the margin. Telson and uropods closely I'esembling in structui-e

those of the sjiecies of Microdeuteropus.

  A single specimen (a female ?) dredged in St. Magnus Bav, 1867.

 (?) Whitei, Bate. Five to eight miles off the island of Balta, 40-5Q
fathoms, and in Balta Sound, about 7 fathoms.

   This species is certainly no Protomedeia ; the squamate, double telson
separates it from that genus. I believe it to be the female of Lillje-

bortjia Shetlandica ; at any rate the male of the present species most

closely resembles the drawing and description of that species in all

respects except that the basos of the last pereiopods is not so distinctly

myserrated as figured. Unfortunately                                type specimens of IJJJjehorgia

SJiedeindica have been mislaid ; and for the present it will bo better to

they will hereafter prove to be the same.

Protomedeia hirsutimana, Eate. Unst Haaf, 90-100 fathoms, and 5-8 miles

east of Balta, 40-50 fathoms. The posterior portion of the body, un-
known to Mr. Bate, has some very remarkable characters. The last

three pereiopods successively increase in length, the apex of the pnlm is

truncate, the finger is short, strong, and bifid, and takes its origin fi'om

one-half only of the end of the propodos, while from the other lialf

spring several long, spine-like seto3. First and second uropods sub-

equal in length ; the first with the branches furnished with the usually

formed spines ; the second of most unusual and remarkal^le character,

excessively strong and massive, the branches furnished on their upper

edge with two rows of immensely strong, but very short, stout, blunt

spines ; last uropods shorter than preceding pairs ; branches subcqual

to peduncle, each bearing about three strong spines and terminating in

a tuft of setae. Telson tubular.

   The extraordinarily massive and immensely strong spined second

uropods have no parallel, as far as I am aware, among the known

species of Amphipoda.

Batlinporeia pilosa, Lindstrom. Forty miles east of Out Skerries, 70-90

I have never met with a male peJagicus, nor a female falcatus. The two

forms occur in company, and the structural differences seem confined to

the exact form of the hand of the gnathopods, organs which seem gene-

rally to differ among the Amphipoda according to the sex.

having a transversely placed pair of tubercles, one on each side of the

back, the tubercles of the last segment of pereion and of tlio first two of

pleon much larger than the others. Eirst gnathopods with Avrist and

twenty-five miles JST. by W. from Bnrrafirth Lighthouse, in 1867. The

specimen is imperfect, having lost antenna?, &c. The sixth and seventh

segments of the pereion appear to be coalesced. It approaches Lii:tma-

finger straight, two-thirds as long as hand. Poreiopoda, last three pair

much longer and more slender than in H. r/alha ; carpus and propodos

scopically pectinate. Rami of all the uropods lanceolate (not widening

in the middle), gradually tapering to the end (not mucronate as in
II. galba) ; the general serrated character of the margins of the rami
agrees with H. galba, except that the external margin of the inner
ramus of the second pair is not serrated. The male differs from the
female, as in the last two species, in having the antennte very long and

slender.

Bate and Westwood's " H. oblivia," which has not the propodos of the

gniathopods at all produced, cannot be Kroyer's species nor that here

described*. Goes takes Kriijer's Lestrigonus exidans to be the male of

II. oblivia ; and as far as the description and figures go, it may be the

male either of that or of H. galba ; but the short pereiopoda of L. exulans
and L. Kinahani of Bate will not agree with the male of //. o^/Uuia.

    These are certainly not satisfactory generic characters, being so in-

complete, but having only one good specimen I am unwilling needlessly to

run the risk of destroying it in the attempt to separate tlie valves, and

therefore am unable to describe the hinge-structure or animal. The cara-

pace is, however, so ?;emarkable that I cannot place it in any described genus.

of the carapace finds its nearest counterpart in Bairdla angusta, G. 0.

       well developed, with a strong seta on the middle of the outer margin,
       and two similar terminal setae, one at each angle of the extremity, with
       a very delicate and minute seta in the middle between them. Caudal
      laminae extremely long and slender, more than equal in length to three
      preceding segments, of a dark brown colour throughout the greater part

        of their length.

       A marine species found among Laminariae in Shetland, and also at

      Tobermory in the Isle of Mull, abundantly. The black colour of the
      basal portion of the caudal laminae is a very useful characteristic by
      which to distinguish the species with a low-power lens Avhen mixed in
       a mass with other Copepoda.

        This most extraordinary species was found by Mr. Hancock in the
        branchial sac and water-passages of Ascidia mentida. It is a very intcr-
         estiag addition to onr fiiuna.

Entorocola eruca, n. sp. Allied to EntorocoJa fidgens, Van Beneden (Re-

        cherches sur la Faune Littorale de Belgique, Crustaces (1861), p. 150,
       pi. xxvi.), but is apparently distinct. The feet have one branch stout,
       papillary, not furnished with any claw, the other much more slender,
       terminating in three minute curved spines. The fifth segment of the
       body has a cylindrical tubercular process on each side of the back. The
       abdomen is composed of two (? three) articulations, and terminates in a
        furca, the branches of which are shorter than broad, and are furnished
        with a spine at the tip.

           Adhering to the intestine of Ascidia intestinalis. The typo of the
       genus was found by Van Beneden in two species of Apliditmi.

        longer, and the caudal laminae fully twice as long as broad, and longer

       than preceding segment. Upper antennaj much shorter than in that

        species, 20-jointed, the eleven basal joints excessively short, the remain-
       ing somewhat longer, but none of them (unless it be the seventeenth and
        eighteenth) as long as they are broad.

      tlian broad, the sides gently convex. Abdomen consisting of two seg-
       ments and tlhe caudal laminae ; the segments short and broad, the second

Mr. A. Hancock, he had undertaken for the Ray Society, and which wUl be
shortly pubHshed, the nomeuclatiu-e of the foUoA^ing list may be relied upon.
Species of BoinjUus, JiofrijIIoides, and allied genera are numerous in Shet-
land, but it being impossible to preserve them satisfactorily, and not having
works with me, I was unable to identify more than two or three species
Avith any degree of certainty, and have thought it better therefore entirely
to omit these genera in the present Report, and leave them for some future

investigator to work out.

       tbis species ; but tbe bottle in. wbieb tbey were preserved was imfor-
       tunatcly lost (I conclude left bebind in Sbetland), and tbus also tbe

        accurate determination of tbe species.

Class POL YZO A.

    For tbis class I bave adopted, as far as it goes, tbe general arrangement

Aof Mr. Busk, in ' Monograpb of tbe Fossil Polyzoa of tbe Crag, 1859.'

Tbis work baving been publisbed subsequently to tbe ' Catalogue of Marine
Polyzoa in tbe collection of tbe Britisb Museum, 1852,' gives us tbe autbor's
maturer views. "^\''itb respect to tbe species, if no reference to otber works
is given, tbey will be found described in tbe ' Catalogue ; ' but, as will be
seen by t'be following Kcport, our knowledge of tbe animals of tbis class bas
been very materially extended since 1852. Herr F. A. Smitt bas just pub-
lisbed a valuable series of papers on tbe Polyzoa of tbe Scandinavian seas,

entitled ·' Ivritisk fcirteckning ofver Skandinaviens Hafs-Bryozoer" (Oi'vers.

af Iv. Yet.-Akad. Forhandl. 1865-67), but I am not prepared to acquiesce in

bis views as to tbe amount of variation to be observed in species of

the class.

Mr. Busk appears to mc to have tfansposed the names of this and the

following species. A\liat I consider to be the true unicornis is the

species evidently referred to by that name in the ' Catalogues' of Alder

and Hincks. It is common between tide-marks.

=ansata, Johnston, L.i(hu'o/-/n's, Busk, Crag Polyzoa, p. 45, pi. v. fig. 4.

This species is distinguished from the last by its short and very broad

cells, and by the much smaller size of its oviccUs. It is a deep-water

form, and is extremely abundant in the Shetland seas, in 40-170

fathoms. "Whether this is really a distinct species from L. unicornis is

l^crhaps doubtful.

tions separating the cells : mouth small, terminal ; lower lip advanced,

encroaching on ihe mouth, convex, pouting, a denticle within the mouth,

wide, little raised, and so deeply seated that it cannot be seen unless

carefully looked for ; upper lip free, bearing two spines (which, however,

are very rarely present). OviceU globose, tumid, wider in the centre

than the top of the cell, with a little transverse rib (caused by the upper

lip) just over the mouth ; surface minutely granular as the cells ; these
minute granulations appear to be centrally punctate. The form of the

ovicells and mouth in the fertile cells remind one forcibly of a helmet

with the vizor raised. An inhabitant of the deepest water, having been

only found in 140-170 fathoms to the N.N.W. of Unst.

   This species comes very near to L. microstoma, but is, I think distinct.

The cells are very much larger, the mouth less tubular and raised, the

ovicells less thrown back off the mouth ; and there is a deeply seated

denticle in the moxith, which does not seem to be the case in L. micro-

stoma.

species ! Such a union, in my opinion, cannot stand. Leaving, there-

fore, L. monodon as the type of Smitt's genus, I propose the name
Tessaradoma, the characters of which will be those given by Alder, h c.
I have not adopted the genus Anarthropora for L. monodon in this

Report, because an entire rearrangement of the Membraniporidae is re-
quired, and until that entire rearrangement is carried out (and this I
hope shortly to do), I have thought it better not to partially dismember

the genus LepraTia.

    I have pleasure in announcing the discovery in the Shetland seas of a
species of this interesting tribe, which i:p to the present time has been
supposed to embrace only freshwater forms. RhahdopAeura was dredged by

me in the Outer Haaf, and being unable to recognize it, I sent it to Pro-
fessor AUmau for his opinion, and the extract from a letter received from
him, given below, wiU show the result of his examination.

lllmhdopJeura Normani, Allmau, nov. gen. et sp. " Now with regard to the

      new genus. Expecting nothing buthydroids in your bottles, and being

        satisfied on a rapid glance that the contents of one bottle were some-
       thing very different from any known hydroid, I at once set the specimen

      down in my mind as that of a new genus of Campanulariaus. I now

    · find that it is no hydroid, but a very curious and new genus of Polyzoa.
        So interesting a form is it that I thought it worth while spending some

        time over its thorough iuvestigation . . . ; and so by the help of acetic
        and chromic acids and liquor potassie, I have succeeded in very fairly
        uuravelUug the structure of your Polyzoon. It is a true Hippocrepian

    --form, as entirely and typically so as Phunatella a fact which gave

      facility to my examination, as I had already made the Hippocrepian

        Polyzoa a special subject of stud}-. One of its most remarkable fea-
        tures is a rigid rod which runs through the coenoecium, and to which
        the polypides are attached, each by a funiculus. This rod was the only
        thing at first visible besides the polypides and their tubes of insertion
        but I afterwards found that the whole of the rod and its attached
        polypides were contained in a most delicate and colourless coenoecium,
       into which the free tubes of insertion were continued. The remarkable
       internal rod will weU suggest a generic name, and I have accordingly

   --thought of Rlmhdopleura as sufficiently significant and distinctive."

        I think, as a remarkable deep-water variety of esculentus. In form it
        is very high in proportion to its breadth, and the diameter is not at all
       greater below than above. The whole outline is perfectly free from any
        appearance of angiilarity in any part, and the spines are remarkably
       slender and delicate. It was brought up from a hard bottom 25-30
       miles north of Unst, in 110 fathoms, and has a totally different
        appearance from the shallow-water forms of the species.

      it is much larger and diiFerent in many particidars. The name I pro-

        pose for it is in allusion to the beautiful pennatifid pcdicellarioe with
       which it is furnished, and which arc wholly unlike those of E. ovatum.
       The specimen procured by Barrett was " dredged in 25 fathoms on the

        south side of Bressay Island, Shetland, on a coarse sandy bottom." I

      have myself seen three specimens of the species from as many different
      localities, one dredged by myself in 1867 in St. Magnus Bay, Shetland,

          Very near to S. pmpumis, but the shell much higher and more

       tumid dorsally, and the hinder portion more produced and narrower in
       comparison with the anterior extremity. The colour is much deeper,
       being of a very deep pvxrple hue in every part ; the larger spines of the

       interambulacral areas are not conspicuously larger and longer than the
       rest ; the ambulacral fascicles are very narrowly lanceolate, four and a

      half to six times as long as broad, and thus much longer in propoi'tion to

       their breadth than in S.pitrpureus, in which they are from twice and a half
       to thrice and a half or, very rarely, four times as long as broad *. The

           The discovery of this species in the Shetland sea is of very high

        interest. It is one of several instances of large conspicuous Mediterra-
       nean species turning np in the great depths of these northei-n waters, and

       which as yet are unknown at intermediate localities. ^. meridional is
       was dredged in 100-140 fathoms, 25-^5 miles N.N.W. of Burrafirth

 Cucumaria frondosa (Gunner). Occurs in marvellous abundance in one par-

       ticular part of Bressay Sound. " Peter," who was Forbes's dredger, was
       indeed true to his word M'hen he stated to me no man knew as he did
        where the " Puddings " were. The contents of the dredge on the very
        first haul was a sight not soon to be forgotten. It was literally fiUed

        with C. frondosa. There rolled out upon the deck thirty or more of
        these huge, deep purple, smooth, slimy Holothurians, measuring from
        10 to 18 inches long, in every state of expansion and contraction, evi-
         dently greatly discomposed at their novel situation, and in their hurry
        to withdraw their much-branched tentacles and make things as snug as
        they could, squirting out streams of water from their capacious maws.

         fiicicola (Forbes &. Goodsir). The type specimens were found not un-
        commonly " in Bressay Sound, Shetland, in 7 fathoms water, adhering
        to the stems of Laminarise," and thus in the same locality with C. fron-
        dosa. Von Diiben and Keren (Ofversigt af Skandinav. Echinod. p. 294)
        referred this species to the young of C. frondosa, and their synonymy
        has been copied by all subsequent writers witho\it inquiry. But the
        young of C. frondosa is like the adult, in that " corpus, coUum et pedum
        latera teguntur gramdis calcareis, irregularibus, difFormibus, nunquam
        perforatis," which is not the case with C. fucicola. Specimens of this
         species, procured by myself in tlie typical locality, have the skin supplied
         with calcareous plates, which are very irregular in form and size, but
        when fully developed are nearly round, rather longer, however, than

        broad, and perforated with as many as 30-40 holes. The sides of the

         feet are likewise furnished with the irregular-shaped, elongated, perfo-

        rated plates common in this position in the different species of the genus

         but these feet-spindes I have also observed sparingly present in the
         young of C. frondosa, though in the passage above quoted Diiben and
         Keren deny their existence.

are spicules present in the skin, and those of the tentacles are of entirely

different structure from those described and figured by Von Diiben and
Koreu in the Scandinavian species, for which 1 would propose the name

Tkyonidium Diiheni. In T. commune the skin is covered with table-
formed spicules, which have the lid round, or nearly round, with an un-
usually even rim, and the perforations numerous, very small and round;
the legs are four, connected at the foot, and each there divided. The

tentacles, instead of being covered with spicula of considerable size, as in

T. D'dbeni, have only very small spicules imbedded in their substance, of
the same character and nearly the same form as those of Thyone fusus,

but of still smaller size.

    This species is well described by Sars, and is certainly, I think,

distinct from Z. Couchii. Johnston described it as a sponge, including

with it the form which he subseqiiently redescribed as an Actinozoon

under the name Zoanthus Couchii. Both these names, therefore, cannot be

retained, and that of Diiben and Koren must be adopted for the present

species. It is found in immense profusion 5-8 miles east of Balta in

40-50 fathoms, inhabited by Pagurus loevis ; also in St. Magnus Bay.

anguicoma, n. sp. Coenoecium coating sjionges, on which it creeps in

strip-like bands, from which at various intervals (generally very short)

arise the polyps ; column 3-5 times as high as broad, slightly expanded
above, external surface of summit with about 18 radiating corrugations.

Tentacles in two rows, about 34, very long and extensile, more than

equal diameter o.f disk when fully expanded, gradually attenuating to

very slender points. Cuticle with sand imbedded in the surface, but not

very firm. Colour pinkish white.

    Living on the Sponges, Phalcellia ventilabrum and rohusta, Normania

crassa, Oceanapia Jeffreysii, &c., in very deep water, 110-170 fathoms,

   Certainly distinct from the last, which has the tentacles veiy short
and rarely extended beyond the mouth ; indeed I question if they ever

are. I have watched the species alive, but have never seen them pro-

truded to any extent ; and Sars says of them, " Pars protractihs poly-
perum tentaculis munita 36-40 biseriahbus, alternantibuS, elongato-

conicis, acuminatis, laevibus (baud verrucosis) superioribus longitudine

dimidiam partem diametri disci oralis sequantibus, inferioribus brevio-

ribus." In Zoanthus anguicoma, on the contrary, they are long, slender,
and very extensile, and a colony of the species with the polyps expanded

is a very pretty sight.

   Taken abundantly in company with Zoanthus incrustatus, of which I
was at one time inclined to consider it a variety ; but more careful ex-

amination and dissection has convinced me that there are certain di-

stinctions between the two besides the fact oiSidisia being a free-living,

unattached form. "Whether those distinctions are specific or sexual

sight, looking over the yacht's side, was a thing never to be forgotten.
The sea was swarming with myriads of the Physojihora, DipTiyes, Cydippe,
and allies, C'yanea, Aurelia, &c., and long chains of Salpa runci-

nata. Among the animals observed that evening was a Medusa (using

with veiy numerous long tentacles round its edge, the whole animal

NAKED-EYED MEDTJSiE.

Although the following species ought to be incorporated with and inserted

in their proper places among the preceding Hydrozoa, yet our knowledge

being at present confined to the gonosome, it is not possible to allocate them

with any degree of precision. I have thought it better therefore to keep

them together here, leaving future discoverers, who shall become acquainted

Mywith the trophosomes, to assign them their respective places.  own

time in Shetland was too much taken up with other animals to allow me to

study these Medusoids. The following list contains the species observed in

Shetland by Forbes, as recorded in his ' Eritish Naked-eyed Medusae ;' but I

have arranged them more in accordance with our present state of knowledge,

throwing them into the families and genera to which they are referred by

Prof. L. Agassiz in his ' Contributions to the Natural History of the United

States,' vol. iv. 1862, end by his son, Alexander Agassiz, in his 'Illustrated

Catalogue of North American Acalephte,' 1865.

                           Class POEIFERA.

    Dr. Bowerbank's ' Monograph of the British Spongiadse ' is used as the

text-book for this Class ; and the whole of my collections having been con-

tinually placed at that author's service during the preparation of his work,
the species in the following hst have in every case, where there was the re-
motest doubt, been sent for examination and determined by him, a large

number of them being types of his species. In the year 1864, when I was
prevented accompanying the Dredging Committee, Mr. Peach, who was of the
 party, paid special attention to the preservation of the sponges, and was in-
strumental in adding a considerable number of species to our fauna.

                                   Order CALCAREA.

 Grantia compressa (Fabr.). Common between tide-marks. The finest spe-

        cimens I have ever seen taken in one hmited spot at the Out Skerries.

      A small and very curious variety between tide-marks in Halse Hellyer,

           Burrafirth.

        ciliata (Fabr.). On Fuci frequent, tide-marks. It is much to be re-

        gretted that Bowerbank in his work has transgressed the law of the
        British Association rules of nomenclature, strictly observed by all natu-
       ralists (except certain French writers), of alRxing that author's name who
        first described the species. Thus he assigns this and the foregoing species
        to Fleming, whereas they were both characteristically described by 0. Fa-
--338 REPORT 1868.

       bricius in his ' Fauna Gronlandica ' forty-eight years before, and simi-

       larly the next species appears as Leucosolenia hotryoides, Bowerhank,

       though Ellis and Solauder were the describers of the species under the

     name Spongia hotryoides. A curious aggregated form occurs in company

       with the var. G. compressa in Halse Hellyer.

&Leucosolenia hotryoides (Ellis Sol.). Common under stones and attached

       to seaweeds. Specimens of gigantic growth found in the same spot with

        the very large Grantia compressa, living attached to the underside of

          stones.

       where lemon-yellow and white varieties live side by side.
Leuconia nivea (Grant). " Shetland, 1864 " (Bowerbank in litt.). The speci-
      mens in this and other cases thus quoted Dr. Bowerbank informs me
       were sent to him by Messrs. Jeffreys and Peach.

APacTiymatisma Johnstonia, Bow.  single sijecimen, procured after great

difficulty, aud not without some danger, at the extremity of ' Will

able conditions of weather.

                               Genus Noemania, Bowerbank, n. g.

   " Skeleton composed at the external surfaces of short fasciculi of siliceous
spicula ; in the interior, of an irregular siliceo-spicular network. Dermis
furnished with ternate connecting spicula. Ovaria membranous, aspiculous.

   " Type, Normania crassa.
    " The general structure of the skeleton of the type specimen of this genus
is very like that of Fachymatisma, but it is readily distinguished from that
genus by the total absence of siliceous ovariu, and by its thin and delicate

dermal system.
    " The radial structure of its skeleton near the surface of the sponge, and

its dermal connecting spicula, bring it somewhat into alliance with Ecionemia,
but the total absence of a central axial column readilj' distinguishes it from

that genus. I have named this genus after my friend the Eev. Alfred Merle
Norman, the ardent and accomplished naturalist to whom I am indebted for

numerous new and valuable species of British sponges."

   A" genus Normania was established by Mr. G. S. Brady in 1866, for a

section of Crustacea Ostracoda {vide Trans. Zool. Sec. vol. v. p. 382), but
that title cannot be accepted, as the Normania of Brady is identical with
Loccoconcha of G. 0. Sars, which was founded a few months previously {vide
G. 0. Sars, Oversigt af Norges marine Ostracoder, 1865, aud G. S. Brady,

Trans. Linn. Soc. vol. xxvi. 1868, p. 432).

" Normania crassa, Bowerbank, n. sp. Sponge cup-shaped, sessile ? ; parietes
        stout and thick. Surfaces smooth, outer one minutely reticulated. Os-
        cula on inner surface simple, variable in size, very numerous. Dermis

         thin, pellucid ; outer surface furnished with a stout polyspieulous irre-
        gular reticulation ; on the inner one with numerous dispersed tension-
        spicula large and small ; spicula subfusifoimi-acerate ; and also with
        numerous large and small attenuato-stellate retentive spicula. Con-

       very short. Skeleton fasciculi and reticulations stout and polyspicu-
       lous ; rote open and irregular ; spicula siibfiisiformi-acerate, long and

      large. Interstitial membranes pellucid, furnished abundantly with smaE
       siibfusiformi-acerate tension- spicula, and with numerous large and small

       (Rev. A. M. Norman). Examined in the dried state."

         To this description of Dr. Bowerbank I may add that the " subfusi-

       formi-acerate teusion-spicula " are incipiently and entirely spined, and
       are, moreover, very frequently furnished with a central umbo.
Ecioncmia compressa, Bow. Rare, in very deep water, XJnst Haaf, in 1864

       and 1868.

              Genus Qttasillina *, Norman, n. g.

   Sponge consisting of a single clavate hollow body, widening upwards from
the base, and rising at once from the surface of the stone to which it is at-
tached, without any expanded basal mass. Skeleton beautifully reticulate,
jirimary fasciculi ascending in parallel straight lines from the base, and in
diverging radiating lines from a central mammasform projection at the
summit of the sponge ; secondary fasciculi at right angles to the primary

ones. Spicula fusiform'i-acuate.

QiiasUHna brevis (Boyv.)=^Poli/mastta hrevls, Bow. Brit. Spongiada;, vol. ii.

p. 64. Frequent on pebbles in from 40 to 170 fathoms. It is necessary
to separate this species from the genus Polymastia ; for whereas in the
latter genus several (often very numerous) fistular cloacae arise from an

expanded basal mass, which is, in fact, the body of the sponge, in Qiuisil-

Jina the entire sponge consists of a single hollow cylinder, which widens

from the base upwards, and is most expanded near the summit. When

compressed, a rupture always takes place between the summit of the

column and the cap-formed top, which separates as a kind of Hd. This

lid, with its central niammajform point, its radiating primary lines of

bundles of spicules, and its transverse secondary lines, reminds us
strongly of the top of a basket. In all these respects the genus ap-

proaches very closely to the genus Euplectella, much more so than do
the species of the genus Poli/masfia. The spicula are needle-shaped

(acuate), swollen in the central part, and attenuated towards the '·' head "
as well as towards the point ; but they arc not " acerate" as described
by Dr. Bowerbank, the head end being blunt and rovmded. The smaller

       spicules sometimes assume a slightly pin-shaped (" spinulate") form.

tish sponge. There are two magnificent specimens in my collection.

One, which spreads out at once from the base, so that the cup is hardly

developed at aU, and the sponge is nearly flat, measuring 13 inches long

and 9 mde, but is only 3 inches high. The other takes the shape of a

very deep well-formed cup, composed of many lobes, cut almost to the

base of the sponge, but together forming a regular circle ; this sponge

is 10 inches high and as much in diameter at the summit. Proliferous

specimens often occur in which many small sponges grow from the inner

face of the parent.

--334 REPORT 1868.

Taken in company with Isodktija laciniosa in 170 fathoms, 20-25

miles N. by W. of Burrafirth Lighthouse, in 1867, and again in 1808.

A very Lirgo and thick species, growing in flat lobatc masses. The

mylargest piece in  collection measures 11 inches' long by G| in its

greatest breadth.

                                Genus Oceanapia*, Norman, n.g.

   Sponge consisting of a hollow sphere fiUed with sarcode, siurounded by a

hard spongeous crust of a very close and compact nature. From the oppo-

site poles of the axis of the spherical or ovate body of the sponge there spring
more or less numerous simple or branched fistute of great size and length
these fistuliB are also furnished at their base with prolongations, which, pass-
ing inwards into the central cavity of the sponge in the form of cylindrical
branching tubes, are bathed in the great sarcodous mass. Skeleton spiculo-
fibrous, irregularly reticulated ; fibres polyspiculous, the primary lines, especi-
ally of the fistulge, of great size. Spicula acerate, stout (Bowerbank, pi. i.
fig. 2) and very minute, in the form of half a ring, " simple bihamatc "
(Bowerbank, pi. v. fig. 109). Dermal membrane reticulate ; rete for the
most part unispiculous ; spicula of the same two kinds as those of the

skeleton.

     =vol. ii. p. 3-47, Isodktija rohtsta, ib. id. p. 304.

           In 1861 I dredged a portion of the spherical crust of this sponge,
       from which the fistulse had been abraded. This ha%aiig been placed in
       Dr. Bowerbauk's hands, was considered by him to belong to the genus
       Isodkti/a, and is described in his work under the name I. rohusta. In

       subsequent expeditions to Shetland I obtained many detached fistulte,
       and also portions of the crust, which convinced me that the entire sponge,
       when found, would prove to be something very difl'erent from what had
       been imagined by Dr. Bowerbank from the type specimen. In 1864
        some of the fistulaj were forwarded by Mr. Peach to Dr. Bowerbank,
       Avho regarded them as a new species of Desmac'ulon {D. Jeffreijsii). At

        length, during the past summer, several perfect specimens of the sponge
        have been dredged, and it is thus proved to be a remarkable species,
        perhaps the most interesting, as it is also one of the largest of British

          Porifera.

            In form and size the adult sponge most strikingly reminds us of a full-
        grown swede turnip. Imagine such a turnip to be going to seed, and to

      have sent up several shoots. Now break these shoots off 4 or 5 inches

         from the bulb, strip off the leaves as well as the smaller fibrous j)or-
        tions of the roots, and scoop out all the interior of the turnip, leaving
        only the rind, and yon will have a very fair idea of Oceanaina. The
         rind represents the spongeous crust ; the hollow interior is a cup filk'd
        with sarcode ; the broken off stems are the cloacae, which are of about
         the size and shape of a finger, the smaller specimens having sometimes

       only one, but the larger as many as a dozen such cloacal fistulso of
        various sizes, which are generally simple, more rarely branched. The

         roots of the turnip represent other fistular appendages of smaller size
        than those which spring from the crown, and of more solid and stringy
         texture. These appear literally to take the place of roots, since in one
        instance they grasp a pebble with their extremities, and in other cases

        show evident signs of having been partially imbedded among sand. My

            largest specimen contained nearly a pint of sarcode in the interior. This

          sarcode is of deeper colour than usual among the sponges, and when the

            dried Oceanapia is cut open the_sarcode will be found lying on that side

          which has been downwards when drying, shi-unk into a solid deep brown
           or almost black mass, having somewhat the appearance and consis-

            tency of cobbler's wax.

       Since the Eeport on the Crustacea has been in print I have received the
· last part of Bate and Westwood's ' British Sessile-Eyed Crustacea,' which

   contains the appendix to that work. Among the species there described are

   several on which, as being connected with the present Eeport, it is necessary
   that I should say a few words.

" Opts leptochela, n. sp." This I find to be the species described by mo under

the name Euonyx chelatus (Brit. Assoc. Eeport, 1866 (1867), p. 202).

My specimen differs from that described by B. & W. in having the

second gnathopods larger and stronger than the first, and the hand fur-

nished with a strong nail. This difference is perhaps one of sex. The

       species cannot, I tlijnk, be placed in the genus Op)is.
" Ampelisca Icevigata." Most unquestionably not the true A. Icevigata, but

the A. tenuicornis of Lilljeborg and of this Eeport. The characters given

by B. & W. are the exact reverse of those which belong to the true

A. Icevigata.

" Haploops tuljicola." B. & "W. give " Shetland " on my authority, but I have

never taken the species there. For " Shetland " read Hebrides*.

A" Lepidepecreum."  new genus is characterized under this name to receive

  * In the 'Zoological Eecord' for 1866, Mr. Bate, in referring to my Hebridean Eeport

ference -which made me think it -wiser to keep them apart until the ex-

amination of Greenland specimens should settle the question definitely.

" l^Upcrlu taur'tformh, n. sp." This is the Metoenis medusarum of Kroyer

by Mr. Edward, to whom I am also myself indebted for specimens.

Report on the Annelids dredged off the Shetland Islands hi/ Mr. G v>vu
        Jeffreys, 18G7-G8. By W. C. M'Ixtosh, M.D., F.L.S.

Mil. GwYX Jeffreys, in his dredging-cxpcdition to the Shetland Islands
last year, kindly selected, chiefly with the assistance of Mr. Sturges Dodd

and the Kcv. A. M. N'ormau, a large number of Annelids, which he most

courteously placed at my disposal; and, as they were properly preserved in

vessels and fluid sent for the pupose, their subsequent examination pi'oved
very satisfactory. The same was done in 1868 ; but owing to the unfavour-
able state of the weather, the collection was very much smaller than that of

the previous year.

   The majority of the Annelids come from St. Magnus Bay, or, rather, from
the deep water (SO-100 fathoms) beyond this, not because they so dispro-
portionatelj- abound there (although the muddy sand is eminently favourable
for their increase), but probably because the dredging was most frequently
cai-ried on in that neighbourhood. The other localities, in the order of the
respective collections, are off Balta, Xorth Unst, Bressay Sound, Outer Haaf
(Skerries), Fetlar, and a small shore collection made by Mr. Dodd at Hills-

Avick.

   The Annelids found in the deep water off Xorth Unst form a collection very
riih in new or rare forms ; for, out of thirteen species, three at least are new
1o science, and four not hitherto fo;ind in Britain. The collection from the
Outer Haaf (Skerries) has also several rare forms; out of eight, four are new to
Britain and one to science. Out of sixty found in St. Magnus Bay, four arc
new to science and eighteen to Britain. These figures contain the entire
new or rare forms in the individual collections, without reference to their
occiuTence in others, as will be apparent when I mention that, oiit of a

total of about ninety-two Annelids at present identified, five or six, so far as

I can at present make out, are new to science, and about twenty-two to
Britain. As before stated, this is one of the best collections of the Idnd ever
made in Britain, whether in regard to the excellent conditioia of the prepara-
tions or the number of new forms. As might be expected, many of the

additions to our fauna are Scandinavian in type ; but others arc not so, at
least they do not occur in the valuable catalogue (Annulata Polj-cha^ta Spcts-
bergiiE, itc.) recently published by Dr. A. J. Malmgren, the enterprising
naturalist of Helsingfors.

ON THE ANNELIDS OF THE SHETLAND ISLANDS.                337

I have described some of the suppose d new forms elsewhere, and therefore

shall refer to them very briefly at present. Thej- arc as follows : Hip])ono6

Jiffrcijsii, n. sp., a smaJl Amphinomacean witli a simple subulate anteuna on

the smooth elevation of tlie dorsum of the head. There is no caruncle.

The branchite consist of tufts of simple processes, or tlicj- are bifid or some-

what fasciculated. The bristles of the superior lobe of the foot are for the

most part shorter and stouter than the inferior, and of a characteristic shape.

It is allied to the Eurij'Jwe horealis of Sars. Eiinoa  , the second

species of the geinis found in Britain, the first being E. nodosa, Sars, also

found in the Shetland seas by Mr. Jeffreys, and desciibed by Mr. Lankcstcr

as a new form, under the name of Anthioe zetlandica (Linn. Trans. A"o1. xxv.)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

in the present species the scales are quite smooth, often bordered with a dark

pigment-belt, and the inferior bristles of the feet have an entire clawed tip.

SiyalioH Bushii, u. sp., a form having the aspect of S. boa rather than that of

S. Mathikhe, to which the scales are most nearly allied in structure ; but the
bristles are larger than in either ease and characteristicallydifferent. jS^otocirriif;

scoticus, n. sp., a Lumbrinereian, with a dorsal branchial lobule to each foot,

and found abundantly in comparatively shallow water in the Hebrides, where

the bottom is clayey mud. Eumenia Jcffvcysu, n. sp., a form first dredged

by Mr. Jeffreys in the Hebrides, but too much decomposed to be minutely de-

scribed : it is allied to E. crassa ; but there are no traces of the branchial fila-

Aments in any specimen.  double row of isolated papillte runs aloiig each

side from the snout to the tail, the summit of each 8'iTMo ^^it to a bundle of
forked and simple bristles. PraxiVa artica ('? Malragren), a species that

very probably is F. artica of that author ; but as he has only mentioned that

it is similar to P. lircetermissa (difiering in the hooks having six teeth), wo

are left quite in doubt as to his form. The teeth of the funnel are in general

more filiform and distinct i\\ix\\ in P. in-atennissa. Pvhjcirrus(^l) trihuJlata,

n. sp., a species having the snout and tentacles of a Pohjcirri's, but without

the bristles or hooks in the anterior region, which is furnished Avith three

circular and somewhat flattened papillae on each side.
   Of the forms new to Britain arc Latmonice fdicornis, Xinberg, which,

however, is Dr. Baird's L. Kuihenji. HarmothoU Jongisetis, Grube, a widely

distributed species, described by Mr. Lankester as If. Malmfjreni {op. cit.),
and therefore previouly found in Britain. PanthaVts (Ersicdi, Xinberg, a

fine species with the habit of a ,Sif/alion. Sk/aJion limkola, Ehlers, a
form found by its discoverer in the Adriatic. It is rather abundant in the

      Shetland seas, but, so far as known, has not yet been found on any other

      part of the British coast. The anterior scales are furnished towards the

      outer margin with peculiar ragged processes. It has four eyes, and not two,

      as stated by Dr. Ehlers. Nephtliys cUiata, Miiller. Genefyllis httea, Malm-

      gren. Anaitis Icosteriensis (?), Malmgrcn. Lnmhnnereis frac/ilis, Miiller,
      a species which probably includes L. tricolor and some others, andtherefore has

V, been found previously on the British coast. It ra7iges from the Channel Islands

       to the north of the Shetlands, and large specimens occur at both extremities.

      OiuiijJiis sicula, De Quatrefages, a curious species (inhabiting a tube composed

      of shell-fragments, stones, and sand), allied to Hyalimccia tubicola, but differ-

     ing cntirJy in the structure of certain of its bristles and hooks, and in the
     absence of the small brush-like bristles. It is not uncommon on the south
     coast of England, as well as in the Mediterranean. Eone Nordmanni, Malm-

      grcn, a species having the aspect of Goniada mcmdata, but differing amongst
      other particulars in the structure of the bristles of the dorsal lobe, which end
      in a somewhat blunt tip, furnished with a translucent conical apicial pro-
                         .

cess. Scohplos armhjer, Miiller, a very common inhabitant of our "u-estem

and northern sandy shores. Naidoneveis qucuh'icuspklata (Fabr.), CErsted,
also abundant in the same localities. Troj)7ionia r/Iauca, Malmgren, charac-
terized by having bristles instead of hooks on the inferior division of the seg-
ments. Chcetopierus norvegicus, Sars, a species -which apparently comprehends
C. insi(/nis, Baird. Scolecolepis cirrata, Sars, not rare in the Shetland seas.
Ithodine Loveni, Malmgren, which has its unciui placed in a double row as

Terebella. It is one of the i/a?cZrtiuc?ce. Axioiliea catenata,'M.&\mgs:ea.. This
has an infundibuliforra anal funnel with alternate longer and shorter fila-

ments, and the base of the cup is marked exteriorly on the ventral sm-face
by a continuation of the median line. The hooks have usually about six teeth
on the summit above the great fang, though the anterior ones have fewer,
and the posterior a larger number. Pmxilla prcetermissa, Malmgren, a
form common on our western and northern shores, in a depth of 4 to 8

&fathoms. Prcuvilla gracilis, Sars. Clymene ehiensis, Aud. Ed., of which

only a single incomplete example occurred. The hooks are less curved than
in the foregoing species, and the crown somewhat flattened. The type was
found on the coast of Brittany. Ampharete artka, Malmgren. Sahellides
sexcirrata, Sars. Chymaa Bairdi, Malmgren, a species very closely allied to
Thdepus Vemisia) circinnatus. LysiUa Loveni, Malmgren, which has six

                           (

pairs of foot-papillne in front, each with a submerged tuft of simple bristles.
The dorsum is densely tubcrculated, and the cephalic lobe furnished with
clavate grooves and filiform tentacles. Euchone ancdis, Kroyer. CJwne in-

ftmdibidiformis, Kroyer.

Bigenerina, which seem sufficiently distinct from previously recorded British

ones to be described under sejoarate names ; but I believe in no other order

is there so much difficulty in defining the limits of species and varieties, and

Aconsequently so much danger of confusion in nomenclature.                  more com-

plete investigation of the dredgings will, I have no doubt, afford additional

novelties.

   In the list and remarks appended to my former Eeport (1867), I endea-

voured to give as complete a view of the Shetland Foraminifera as our pre-
sent knowledge permitted, so that a comparison can be made of their relation

to those of the whole kingdom and of some neighbouring countries.

C'ldaris paplllata, Leske. I find that by some accident I have omitted to

notice this species in the enumeration of species. It appears to be

absent to the east and north-east of Shetland, as during our dredging

in those directions we never saw any trace of it, and the fishermen at the

Out Skerries were unacquainted with it. The specimens which have

been procured through fishermen have been all from the western coast

and Ave had the pleasure of dredging the Piper in some numbers, 2.5-3.5

miles N.N.W oflp Unst in 110-170 fathoms in company with Sj}atangus

meridionalis and other rarities. They appear to be verj'- sluggish in

their movements, as though kept alive for some time in a large tub of

water, they showed very little inclination to change their position ; of
course, however, they found themselves placed in very unusual and

probably very uncongenial conditions.

--Heport on the Chemical Nature of Cast Iron. Part I. Account of

   some Experiments made to obtain Iron free from Sulphur. By A.
   Matthiessen, F.R.S., and S. Prus Szczepanowski.

Following out the plan indicated in the preliminary report presented to the

Association in the year 1866, we have been endeavouring to prepare pure
iron, but have encountered greater difficulties than we expected, owing to
the great affinity which iron has for sulphur. Although we have not been

able as yet to prepare iron absolutely free from sulphur, yet the results, as

far as they have been obtained, may be of interest to the Association, and

a brief account of them is given in the following pages.
   In the endeavour to prepare pure iron, we always found sulphuretted

hydrogen on dissolving the metal in dilute hydrochloric acid. The small
quantity of sulphur contained in the iron did not proceed from the liydrogen
or from the platinum-tube in which the oxide was reduced. The manner of
preparing the pure hydrogen and the precautions taken with the platinum-

tube will be described hereafter.

    The first series of experiments were made by precipitating the hot, concen-
trated, clear solution of protosuljihateof iron by oxalate of ammonium, washing

the precipitate till the wash-waters no longer indicated sulphuric acid with
chloride of barium, heating the dried oxalate of iron to redness in a platinum-
dish, and reducing the oxide tluis obtained in a platinum-tube. The reduced

iron contained sulphur. In all the experiments we describe sulphur was

tested in the following manner. The iron was placed in a test-tube with some
dilute pure hydrochloric acid, and the gases were allowed to pass through a
small tube fitted into a cork in the test-tube, and to impinge on a paper
moistened with acetate of lead. The evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen, after
a very little experience, moreover is just as easily detected by the smell.

    Experiments were also made with the oxalate of iron by redissolving it in
hydrochloric acid and reprecipitating with ammonia, or by dissolving the oxide
obtained by heating the oxalate of iron in hydrochloric acid, and reprecipi-
tating again by oxalate of ammonium. In all these cases the reduced iron

contained sulphur.
    The second series of experiments were with iron obtained from the crystal-

line oxide. It is well known that when protosulphate of iron is fused with

chloride of sodium, a crystalline oxide is obtained. For our experiments it
was of course necessary to perform this operation in a platinum crucible,
but it was found that the iron thus obtained contained a small quantity of
platinum. "\Ve therefore employed instead of chloride of sodium the sulphate
 of sodium, and obtained an oxide which, after being thoroughly washed and
 reduced, gave an iron containing no platinum but still traces of sulphur.
 Experiments were then made by dissolving the crystalline oxide in pure

hydrochloric acid, and precipitating the solution by ammonia, washing the
oxide, and reducing it. The ii'on thus prepared contained siilphur. The
next experiments were made by dissolving the crystalline oxide in hydro-
chloric acid, digesting with chloride of barium for several days, decanting
and filtering through paper (previously digested with dilute nitric acid), pre-
cipitating by ammonia (distilled from ammonia to which chloride of barium
had been added), washing, and reducing the oxide. The iron thus prepared

still contained sidphur.

   The third series of experiments were made with sublimed proto- or sesqui-
chloride of iron by dissolving it in water, precipitating with pure ammonia,
washing, and reducing in hydrogen. iUl the specimens thus prepared
contained sulphur. The sublimed chloride was obtained sometimes from the
red oxide prepared by heating the oxalate of iron, obtained as above described,
or from the crystalline oxide by dissolving it in hydrochloric acid, digesting
with chloride of barium, evaporating to dryness, and subliming either in

platinum vessels or in porcelain tubes, or in clay retorts, either alone or in a

current of chlorine or of hydrochloric-acid gas.

    In the fourth series of eosperiments the metal produced by either of the
above methods was submitted in the platinum-tube, whilst red-hot, alterna-
tively to the influence of hydrogen and oxygen, or hydrogen and steam, or of
vapours of nitric acid and hydrogen, or of ammonia vapours, oxygen, and
hydrogen. In all the cases the operation was repeated several times, and
although sulphuretted hydi'ogen was given off during these operations, yet
the iron always contained sulphur.

   Purther experiments were made by dissolving the purest iron in dilute
acetic acid, evaporating to dryness and heating. The metal obtained still

contained sulphur.

    Also the iron obtained from ferrocyanide of potassium* was found to contain

sulphur.

    In fact we have never made or found a specimen of iron which did not
contain sulphiir. Even electrotype iron, said to be prepared from chloride of
iron, evolved, by dissolving in dilute hydrochloric acid, a very appreciable

quantity of sulphuretted hydrogen.

   On the whole we have made upwards of seventy series of experiments.
   From the above it wiU be seen that we have not yet obtained a method of

preparing iron free from sulphur. In fact one great difficulty is to obtain
vessels which will not give up sulphur to the iron in some form or another.
For instance, the platinum-tube had to be polished and boiled out with acid

eyery time before use. It may be mentioned that the hydrogen employed

was led through the platinum-tube before reducing the oxide of iron for a
quarter of an hour or more, and yielded no sulphiu-etted hydrogen.

   Although no positive results have been obtained, we have in no ways lost
hope of preparing iron free from sulphur. No doubt, on a very small scale,
this might be done without much trouble ; but we must bear in mind that
our method must be such a one as to allow the preparation of pure iron on

--at least the ounce-scale.
    November 1868. The amount of sulphur contained in some specimens
prepared since the Meeting of the Association amounted to only 0-001 to

 0-005 per cent., the presence of the former quantity being easily detected

both by the smeU as well by the lead paper.

Interim Report of the Committee on the Safety of Merchant Ships and

                                               their Passengers.

As far as the Committee had been able to pursue their inquhy, it appeared
that no legal regulations were in force in Great Britain aifecting the loading
of merchant ships ; but there were regulations in force by the Board of
Trade relating simply to vessels carrying passengors or emigrants, and these

only related to space as bearing on the sanitary condition of such passengers,

--totally ignoring their safety as far as the stowage of cargo and deck-loads

were concerned the matter on wliich the Committee had to report. In
order to carry out effective]}' any regulations, some precise agreement should
be entered into with all the great maritime powers, and the deej) di'aught
of every vessel should be distinctlj' indicated by a fixed and clearly defined
mark, such as a painted white ribbon extending about six feet on each side
of the stem as well as stern-post (not in mid-ship), and so distinctly scribed
in wooden and cut into iron ships that it could not be tampered with.

When a ship was so loaded by the stern an average should not be taken, but

when so loaded the load-lino at that point sliould not be immersed. The load-
line should be fixed by a government inspector. Tlie great loss of steamers
sailing from Hull had been occasioned by overloading and the shipjiiug of
successive heavy seas, the extra weight of which had caused the foundering
of the vessels. Deck-loads might be carried during summer if well secured,
and boats v\'hen stowed should be some height from the deck, so that the
water shipped should have a clear passage. The lashings of the boats ought
to be of rope, so that thej' could be readily cut in an emergency. Crews
should be practised in the lowering of boats. The regulations thus indicated

 ought to apply to foreign vessels entering or leaving British ports.

Report on Observations of Luminous Meteors, 1867-68. By a Committee,

    consisting of James Glaisheh, F.R.S., of the Royal Observatory,
    Greenwich, President of the Royal Microscopical and Meteorolo-

   gical Societies, Robert P. Greg, F.G.S., E. W. BrayleYj F.R.S.,

    Alexanders. II'ERscu'E.h,F.R.A.S.,and Charles 'Brooke, F.R.S.,

     Secretary to the Meteorological Society.

In the first Appendix of this Eeport, immediately following the Catalogue,
will be found the remarks of observers on the appearance of the August me-
teoric shower in the current year, together with the heights of eleven shoot-
 ing-stars, simultaneously observed at English stations, on the occasion of its
return. In addition to these results, the heights of several meteors, simul-
 taneously observed in recent yours by Professor Hcis and his assistants, are
 contained in the first Appendix.

    Large meteors, star-sliowers, and aerolites have continued during the past
 year to attract the attention of observers, cspeciallj- on the 1st, 28th, and
 31st of January, and on the 29th of February last. Brief accounts of tiieir
 appearance, Viith other observations of lumijMus meteors, chronologically ar-
 ranged, are entered in the Catalogue ; while fuller accounts of the details
 and attendant circumstances of the phenomena are included in the second
 Appendix of the lleport. The same Appendix also contains a collection of
 accounts (chiefly extracted from foreign sources) of the August and November

star-showers in the year 1867, ilhistrating the brief duration and the hmits

of the geogi-ajjhieal area of visibihty of those showers.

The expected reappearance of the November meteoric shower in the year

1866 was such a rare occasion for careful observations that, in anticipation

of its I'eturn at the appointed time, the calculations of astronomers had pre-

viously been directed to determining the real velocities and orbits of shower-

meteors. Of these bodies, the impiiries relating to the August meteor-ring

led Mr. Schiaparelli to the remarkable discovery (which was shortly also

verified in the case of the November meteors, at their reappearance) that the

orbits of those meteor-groups coincide almost perfectly with the orbits of

certain periodical comets. Some other investigations, of which recapitula-

tions, owing to the number of observations of the November meteors con-

tained in the Catalogue of the last lleport, were deferred by the Committee

until a more convenient opportunity should present itself for abstracting

them, are contained in the last Appendix of this lleport.

The entire series of charts of radiant-points, of four of which lithographed

copies were last year exhibited to the British Association at Dundee, were

afterwards printed, and bound together in an Atlas for distribution to ob-

servers, and to scientific persons and societies, of whose names and addresses

a list is given in the same Appendix ; and they were forwarded to their desti-

Anations at the close of last year.  new edition of the Meteor Atlas has since

been prepared, with three new charts, and with the addition of several

observations and improvements not contained in the previous Atlas. To

indicate the characters and positions of all the radiant-points at pi-esent

ascertained to exist in the northern hemisphere, a list of the meteoric showers

which it portrays accompanies the Atlas, and is inserted in the last Appendix

of this Report. Some copies of the new edition having now been printed, to

assist in multipljing them, the Committee contemplate offering the whole of

these copies for sale to observers at the lithographer's price.

The direction of shooting-stars in the southern hemisphere has, during the

past year, been made the subject of a Memoir by Professor Heis and Dr,

ANeumayer.  series of nearly 2000 observations, obtained by the latter

observer at Melbourne during the years from 1858 to 1863, having been

submitted to examination by Dr. Heis, with a view to determining their

points of radiation, thirty-nine radiant-points of shower-meteors were in-
dicated by these researches in the southern hemisphere. Four radiant-

points of Dr. IIeis"s list, which is given in connexion with the foregoing list in

this Keport, appear to be identical with four of the seventy-seven radiant-

points observed in the northern hemisphere, leaving seventy-three separate

radiant-points of meteoric showers recorded in the latter hemisphere alone.

The general survey of meteor-showers, which at present extends to both
hemispheres, accordingly increases the total number of radiant-points now
recognized as clearly distinguishable from each other to about one hundred

and twelve, or double of the number formerly reckoned in the list, as pre-
viously stated in these Eeports*. For the purpose of verifying and inves-
tigating the connexion which apparently exists between certain of the radi-
ant-points, the long duration and apparent fixity of position of others, and

the dates of their maximum displays, a collection of further observations, and

their regular discussion with a view to circumscribe the laws of the appear-

ances of meteoric showers, will continue, on account of their increasing astro-

nomical interest, to present an important subject of inquiry.

        I. («) Heights of August Meteors observed iu England ia 1868.
   Simultaneous observations of the August meteora in 1868 were made by
observers at several British stations, for the purpose of ascertaining the real
altitudes of the meteors. The coui-se of the shower Avas, for the most part,
seen imder favom-able cii'cumstances ; and a number of shooting-stars were
observed, the apparent paths of eleven of which were recorded simultaneously,
at distant places, with sirfficient acciiracy to enable their heights to be ap-
proximately kno-mi. The double observations of shooting-stars, and those of
other meteors of the shower presenting characters of peculiar interest, are

twelve meteors observed, twenty-one on the 8th, none on the 9th, the sky
being overcast, twenty-five on the 10th, eleven on the 12th, and eleven on
the 13th, making a total for the seven nights of eighty meteors, of which
no fewer than fifty-two are referable to Kadiant A^^. It was considered
that the meteors were imusuaUy scanty in number on all these nights.

   At the Badcliffe Observatory, Oxford, on the evening of the 8th of August
six meteors, and on that of the 9th four meteors were observed, the sky on
these nights being frequently obsciu'ed by clouds. On the night of the 10th
the sky became clear at 9'' p.m. ; but in the first forty-five minutes, although
a strict watch was kept, no meteors were observed. In the interval between
9'' 45" P.M. and 1'' 20" a.m. on the 11th, the paths and other particulars of
fifty-six meteors were recorded by Mr. Lucas. At about 11'' p.m., faint

auroral streamers near the Milky Way were observed by Mr. Main; and

several distant flashes of lightning were seen, during the next hour, in a
quarter of the horizon where the sky was free from clouds.

   On the night of the 11th, Mr. Lucas, watching alone, recorded twenty-sLx

meteors in the space of three hours and a quarter, between 9'' p.m. and
12'' 15'° A.M. on the 12th ; a thick haze then sprang up, through which only

the largest stars could be discerned.

   On the night of the 12th the clouds cleared off at about 11" p.m. ; and in

the space of 2" 23'", between 11" 17"' p.m. and 1" 40"' a.m. on the 13th, Mr.
Lucas, watching alone, again recorded twenty-six meteors.

   At Hifjlijield-House Observatory, Beeston, Mr. Lowe observed twenty-six

meteors, and recorded the paths and instants of their appearance to the
nearest second of Greenwich time, between 9" 30"' p.m. and midnight, on the
evening of the 10th. Twenty other meteors were observed, of which no
record was included in the list. In the earlier part of the evening the sky
was overcast, and a thunder-storm commenced at 6" a.m., on the 11th, with
abimdant rain (2 inches falling during the day), which put an end to the
long previous drought. " The meteors were most abundant between 10" p.m.
and 10" 15'" p.m., and there were several points of convergence : one in the
sword-handle of JPerseus, and another slightly north of and above Cassiopeia,
accounted for most of the meteors. The paths were very short in all meteors
seen near these points ; those meteors in Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, and
in S. and S.W., had very long paths. All were blue or colourless, mostly
intense blue, and nearly aU had streaks, were very rapid in their movem_ents,

and vanished instantaneously. From 11" p.m. clouds and moonlight inter-
fered much with the observations. The meteor at 9" 58"' 50'* was very re-

markable. During the last few days there have been several large meteors
each evening between 9" 15" p.m. and 10" 15" p.m."

    On the night of the 11th the sky was entirely overcast.
    At Birmingham, on the night of the 8th of August, the sky was clear from
9" 50" P.M. until 11" 50" p.m., and Mr. W. H. Wood, obseiwing alone, re-
corded fourteen meteors in two hours. Two of these meteors exhibited in-

 termittent light.

    On the night of the 9th the sky became clear soon after 9" 30"' p.m., and
forty-one meteors were recorded by Mr. Wood in three hours. Between

 11" 20" P.M. and midnight there was a remarkable scarcity of meteors, two

 meteors only being seen in forty minutes.

    The sky became clear on the night of the 10th at ten o'clock, and forty-
 two meteors were recorded by Mr. Wood, observing alone, in two hours and

a half. Freqiieut tlashes of lightning were seen after ll*" 15TM p.m., apparently

beyond the horizon, between the north and west. Two of the brightest

meteors, on this night, appeared at 12'' 8TM and 12'^ 25" a.m. of the 11th.

   On the night of the 11th the sky was clear of clouds but hazy between

10'' 15TM P.M. and 11'' 35TM p.m., and meteors were not so frequent as on the
previous night. In the half hour following midnight none were visible.

    The largest meteor observed during the display appeared at 12" 25TM a.m.
on the 11th. This meteor was as bright as Venus, of orange and green
colour, and left in its course an emerald-green massive-looking train, 1-1°
long and 6' broad (see fig. 1). After ten seconds it assumed a serpentine
form (fig. 2), and shortened itself some 4°. Eventually the extremities
turned round westwards, forming the segment of a circle, almost at right
angles to the meteor's original course (fig. 3). It remained visible upwards

of half a minute.

" From the foregoing numbers it will be seen that the shower difters in

many particidars from those previously recorded, in accui'acy of radiation,

presenting fewer radiant-points and a less confused appearance ; while the
presence of green, yellow and orange, and of train-bearing meteors in such

large proportions makes it conspicuously different from the August meteor-

shower in 1866 {vide Eeport for that year, p. 141). The radiant e Cassio-

peia; produces nearly the same percentage number of meteors, and the pro-

portion of 1st- and 2nd-magnitude meteors is nearly the same, as in the August

shower of 1867 {vide lleport for that year, p. 409). On the other hand, the

hourly numbers are double of those in 1867, and agree more nearly with those

Aobserved in 186G."         list of the apparent paths of the foregoing meteors

radiants. The whole were accompanied by luminous trains, which faded from

the ends towards the centre, being broadest in the middle, as in previous

years. In some cases, perhaps in most, they only attained theii- full breadth

   On the night of the 13th, two bright and five smaller meteors were noted
in forty-five minutes, radiating from near S Cassiopeiae. From this radiant-

point, also, the two exceptional meteors observed on the night of the 10th
were directed.

   At IfaiukJmrst, on the nights of the 9th and 11th, the sky was overcast.
In two hours and a half, between 9"^ 30"" and 12^ p.m. on the night of the

10th, twenty-three meteors were registered, and many others were seen, of

which the particulars were not uoted. The brightness and coloiu's of the
meteors recorded were as follows :

    Eleven of the meteors left luminous streaks. Foitr meteors of the list are

identified as having been simultaneously observed by Mr. Wood at Uirming-

ham.

   At Sunderland, Mr. T. W. Backhouse watched for the meteors on the

nights of the 7th, 8th, and 9th of August. " The sky was clear on the latter
night, and thirty-five meteors were recorded, all of which, with only three or
four exceptions, appeared to be conformable. The meteors came very irregu-
larly; they seemed most frequent from lO*" 40"* to ll'' 10"' p.m. Their
average rate of frequency was about twenty-two per hour. The radiant-
point was about R.A. 2" ^o"", N. Decl. 53°. Most, or all of the bright ones

left trains."

   On the nights of the lOth and 11th the sky was overcast.
   At Wisheach, Cambridgeshire, the sky was cloudy on the 9th, and three
meteors radiating from Cassiopeia were observed. On the night of the 10th

the sky was cloudless, and Mr. S. H. Miller noticed a shower of bright
meteors leaving long trains, which were brightest at the middle of their
length. On the night of the 11th the sky was again overcast.

   At Cambridge the shower was seen to great advantage on the night of
the 10 th, by Mr. G. Forbes ; and a number of the meteors were referred to

   " The night was remaj-kably clear; and many meteors were seen before be-
ginning to record them. There were no large meteors ; and none burst. The

   " On the night of the llth-12th the sky was clear after half-past 11, but
the moon too bright for observations after 1 o'clock. The paths were very

short, and only live were near enough to the radiant to be ma2)ped (repre-

sented by dotted lines in the figure, i. to v.). These are quite discordant

Abut it appears that the radiant of yesterday is not that of to-day, being

the position of yesterday's and B about that of to-day's. Yesterday it was
remarkable how much truer to the radiant-point the meteors were than last

year f ; to-day seven, at the very most, came from about A, nearly all

whose directions I could produce backwards coming from nearer to B.

" Two meteors on this night appeared to pass beyond their trains with

undiminished brilliancy, till they were suddenly extinguished ; they were,

however, too rapid and short-lived for me to be perfectly certain about it."

One such meteor was observed at 12'' 33"                                                                                                                                                                       the train of another meteor, which

still very doubtful. The apparent paths of the meteors 8, 9, 10, as recorded
at Birmingham, require to be prolonged towards the points of disappearance,
and to be shortened at the points of first appearance, while opposite correc-
tions nearly equal in amount (about 8°) require to be applied to the apparent

paths observed at Winchfield, in order to satisfy the conditions of simul-

taneous observation. The discrepancy of the observations in each case would
be explained by supposing those at Birmingham to have reference to an early
view, and those at Winchfield to refer to a view of a somewhat later portion
of the visible path of the same meteor.

   The direction of the meteor No. 11 relatively to the two stations is not
favourable lor very exact determinations of its height, which are, accord-
ingly, affected by probable errors of many miles for 1° of error in the observa-
tions. The same probable error in the other meteors of the list does not, in
any case, exceed 2 or 3 miles.

1866). In addition to the brilliant fireball, whose light in broad day was lite

that of a faint flash of reddish lightning, and which was chiefly visible at a

distance from the place of fall (Eperies, llakamaz, &c. ; see Report for 1866,

p. 133), the following unusual phenomena attended the stonefaU. l^early

simultaneously with the appearance of a small bluish cloud in the air over

Sztricsava, near Knyahinya, there was heard at that place, and for many

miles round, a sharp report, like that of a six-pounder cannon, followed for

ten minutes by a rumbling sound like that of water boiling, the rumbhng of

a cart on a pavement, or of stones striking together. Three or four minutes

after the first report stones were seen to fall at varioiis places over an extent

of area measuring from jST.IST.E. to S.S.W. about 9 miles in length, and about

3| miles in breadth from W.N.W. to E.S.E. The stones when picked up
wore lukewarm, as if shone iipon by the sunt, or even as warm as if taken

freshly from an oven. One, of the size of a plum, which fell upon a linen cloth,

did not singe it. The smaller stones did not penetrate the earth more than a

few inches, or lay upon the siu'face. One of moderate size, which fell through

a tree at the door of the inn at Knyahinya, broke from it a branch half an

inch in thickness ; and ten such branches were broken by a larger stone, in

its fall through an apple-tree, beneath which it was found. Many other

stones were seen to fall. That which weighed 73^ lbs. (Austrian) penetrated

the firm sandstone-earth of the district to a depth of 2 feet. About 100

paces from it, three weeks after the occurrence, was found a hole 4 feet wide

and 4^ feet deep, round which the earth had been scattered to a distance of

30 yards. On sounding the hole a firm stone was discovered at a depth of

11 feet below the surface. The aerolite was exhumed. It was found to be

broken across, and, with the remaining pieces discovered in the same hole,

weighed about 300 kilogrammes (660 lbs. English). The direction of pene-

tration was from N. 31° E., altitude 63°. Its position, a league N.E. from

Knyahinya, occupies the extreme JS'.iST.E. corner of the general area of the

fall. Another very large stone is said to have fallen about two miles S.W.

from Knyahinya, which could not be discovered. Since the fall of an aerolite

related by Pliny to have taken place at iEgospotamos, about 465 b.c., which

was a fiill waggon-load, this is the largest fragment of an aerolite (not inclu-

ding masses of meteoric iron) on record. The following, according to Dr.

Haidinger, are the weights (avoirdupois) of the largest recorded specimens of

Newother aerolites, viz. Ensisheim, 280 lbs. ; Jiivenas, 240 lbs. ;                                    Concord,

    Dr. Haidinger estimates that, on a moderate allowance for those which
fell undiscovered, at least 1000 aerolites fell, and that the whole mass must
have weighed not less than 8 or 10 cwts.

   Report of Dr. J. G. GalJe on tJte fall, and on the meteor's path in space

--A(Abhandlung der schlesischen Gesellschaft fiir vaterl. Cultur, March 4, 1868).
        great shower of aerolites took place near Pultusk, 25 miles N. from
Warsaw, over a space four and a half miles in length, from Obryte (E. long.
20° 47', N. lat. 52° 42') to Sielc (E. long. 20° 38' 30'', N. lat. 52° 47'), in a
direction from 8.S.W. to W.N. E., and only one mile in breadth. The largest
aerolite, weighing 10 lbs., was found at Makoff, the extreme N.N.E. point of
the space of fall. Those found at Sielc weighed between 3 lbs. and 4 lbs.
and the remaining stones, becoming gradually less towards the S.S.W.,
weighed on the average 2 lbs., lib., and | lb., as far as Obryte, where aero-
lites of the smallest size only fell, of weights not exceeding | lb. The direc-
tion and manner of their distribution, it ^vill be seen shortly, coincides nearly,
but not quite, ynth. the direction of the meteor's course. The stones are
shaped Hke spHntered fragments of a larger mass, rounded at the edges and
coated over with a dull, brown or black crust, glittering here and there with
grains of metalhc iron. In the interior of one perfect aerolite was found a

solid piece of metallic iron of the size of a cubic inch.

   Ten seconds before the heavy report which accompanied the stonefall at
Sielc, and 3| minutes l)efore the sound of the report was heard at Warsaw,
an intensely brilliant fireball exploded over the neighbourhood, with such
dazzling brightness that it was seen as far as MiiUrose (230 B. S. miles), and
at Frankfort on the Oder (415 miles fi-om the place of fall). Although the sky
was overcast, and even the moon's light was darkened by a snowfall, the illu-
minating power of the meteor at the latter place was so intense that the light
of the gas-lamps in the streets was overpowered. At Weriiigerode, on the
Harz Mountains (also 415 miles from the place of fall), the windows and the
outline of a house a mile off could be plainly distinguished by its light, which
lasted five seconds, although the meteor there shone at a very small altitude
above the horizon. The meteor appeared first as a small shooting- star, gra-
dually increasing in splendour and changing from a star to a conical form,
scattering sparks, and leaving a train of carmine colour on its course, until,
from a bluish bolide of ordinary appearance, it became a well-defined fiLi-eball
of red colour, and burst into a shower of sparks, which descended vci'tically

over Sielc.

    Dr. GaUe estimates the height of the explosion at 25 miles above the earth
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

and this agrees -vritli the interval between the light and the report at "War-

saw (although not quite so well with that observed at Sielc). From this

point the aerolites descended vertically upon Sielc with such slight velocity

Athat none of the stones were buried in the ground.    flight of 115 miles in

about 6f seconds, descending from a height of 160 or 185 miles at first ap-
pearance, nearly represents, according to the observations at Breslau and

Dantzig, the meteors real path. The point of radiation (i^ Piscium) is only

23° from the point opposite to the " apex of the earth's way." The relative

velocity of the meteor with respect to the earth, depending on the duration of its

flight, 6| seconds, which is a mean result of twenty-six independent observa-

tions, is 17 miles per second ; so that the meteor appears, in its real orbit in

space, to have pursued and overtaken the earth directly in its path, with

an inclination to the latter of only 11°, and with a real progressive velocity

in its course of 35 B. S. miles per second.

The following, according to Dr. Galle, are tlie hyperholic elements of the

orbit of the meteorite, which cannot be reduced within the limits of the para-

bolic form, unless by nearly doubling the assumed time of the meteor's dura-

tion, or by supposing its apparent path at Dantzig to be diminished by

nearly one half (from 38° to 20°), a supposition which is not by any means

easily reconcilable with the remaining observations :

A change of the assumed velocity, Dr. GaUe adds, would principally affect

remaining elements of the orbit.

 --Report of Dr. Haklinger on tlie stonefall (Vienna Acad. Sitzimgsbericht,

vol. Ivii. pt. 2. March 1868). The site of the shower of aerolites, of which

the three largest stones weighed respectively 2 lbs., 4 lbs., and 10 lbs., is

between Ostrolenka and Pultusk, forty miles N.E. from Warsaw. The small-

est of the three large stones is in the Mineralogical Museum at Vienna. It

is an equilateral wedge, 2 or 3 inches wide, and 3 or 4 inches long ; its faces

marked with circular depressions, and glazed over with a thin dull-black crust.

In its structure it coincides with Partsch's group of Eichstiidt, Barbotan,

Timochin, Zebrak, and Gross-Dwina, to which may now be added Zerkou

and Bustee, aU of which have large contents of iron and a high specific gra-

vity, 3-5.5-3-70 ; that of the Sielc aerolites is 3-G6. Their substance is tu-

faceous, grey or brown, containing darker spherules intimately admixed with

Airon and a small quantity of Troilite.      polished section exhibited black

lines, with a fine thread of metallic iron running in them, which apparently

represent the planes of friction, fissure, or striation not uncommonly met with

in terrestrial rocks. Many other stones were picked up on the site of the

faU ; and the shower of aerolites is sirpposed by Dr. Haidinger and by Dr.

Galle to have entered the atmosphere as a swarm of separate stones, like

those aerolitic showers which fell at Barbotan, L'Aigle, Stannern, Orgueil,

and Knyahinya.

3. Villa ISTova, Casale, Piedmont, 1868, February 29th, 11"^ a.m. (local time).

Note hy P. F. Denza (BuUettino Meteorologico del Coll. E. Alberto di
--AMoncallieri, Turin).
                         mass of fire, surrounded by cloud, moving with great

velocity, was seen at a considerable height above YiUa Nova (E. long. 8° 27',

IST. lat. 45° 8') near Casale. It was followed by two violent detonations, at

an interval of a few seconds, and by a prolonged report, like rapid file-firing,

which was heard as far as Alessandria, seventeen English miles from Casale.

Three stones reached the ground, each of which struck the earth with a heavy

sound. The locality of the fall is between Villa Nova and La Mota dei Conti

(E. long. 8° 30'). The largest of the stones, weighing about 15| lbs. avoird.

fell north of Villa Nova, and buried itself in the ground to a depth of 14

inches. The second, weighing nearly 3 lbs., struck the earth a mile and a half

from the first, a few feet from a peasant, at whose feet it buried itself in the

earth to a depth of 20 inches. 'The third, which was probably h lb. or | lb.
in weight, struck the ground close to a lady, who witnessed its descent, two

miles from the spot where the second stone descended ; and it was broken in

pieces by the' fall.

The second stone presents in its outline a series of sinuosities, while the

largest stone is bounded on three faces by plane surfaces, meeting each other

at right angles. Its entire surface is coated with a yellowish bronze-coloured

glaze, resulting fi-om external fusion of its substance, which is also found on

one face of each of the broken fragments of the smallest stone. The freshly

fractured surfaces exhibit the interior structure of the aerohte, whitish, and

granular in its texture, like fine-grained granite, wherein the microscope re-

veals throughout a number of bright metallic specks. The stones are strongly

attracted by the magnet. Their specific gravity is Jj-G.

This is the third shower of aerolites that has occurred in the vicinity of

ACasale during the last interval of fifty years.  large meteor was observed

on the Adriatic coast on the morning of the aiirolitic fall, and another large

fireball on the evening of the same day at Alessandria.

 --At Ropley, Hampshire. The apjjearance of the streak is thus described
--by Mr. A. Harding: "The meteor left behind it a luminous train which

appeared as a streak of silver in the sky, disjointed about 12° from the point
of starting ; and in the latter portion two bright spots were visible, the first

nearly round, and the second pear-shaped, the tail being still prodiiced about
1° beyond the latter spot. About two minutes after its appearance the for-

mer part of the train took a wa%y motion, which continued for five minutes,
when a cloud intercepted the view. Eifteen minutes after the appearance of
the meteor the cloud cleared away, and the streak apparently was as bright
as ever ; but the cloud again interposed ; and when the streak was again
seen, at forty-seven minutes past seven, it was perceptibly fading, having
lasted fully twenty minutes. At this time the sky became overcast, prevent-

ing my seeing the final disappearance of this magnificent meteor."

  --At Southampton. Appearance of the streak, as described by Mr. E. L.
--WoUaston : " At 7'' 30'" a.m. there was a perfectly clear sky, except a few

clouds very loAV on the horizon ; a slight breath of air, just enoagh to show
its direction by the smoke of chimneys, coming from about N.E. On the dis-
appearance of the meteor there was a narrow line of light throughoiit the
whole of its course. The greater part of this disappeared within a few mi-
 nutes ; but small portions, gradually disai^pearing, remained, assuming the
 appearance of very narrow, thin, white clouds. One very short part (say.

about one-thirtieth of the Tvhole course) was -visible for forty minutes, until
8" 10*", -when it disappeared immediately over, and in consequence of the in-
creasing light from, the sun. This short part had been very slowly moving
during those forty minutes in an easterly dii'ection, and therefore against the
wind as it blew on the surface here."

1. The August Meteors in 1867.

The August meteoric shower, in 1SG7, was more irregular in the time and

place of its appearance, as remarked by M. Quetelet, than it appears to have

Abeen observed in any previous year.  great scarcity of meteors about mid-

night on the night of the 10th was observed at many places, and especially

--in Italy at Milan by Prof. Schiaparelli, at Palermo by Prof. Cacciatore, and

at YaraUo, in Piedmont, by Prof. Calderiui. The following are the numbers

counted by the latter observer, watching alone, the sky being perfectly clear,
and the moon uniformly bright throughout the time of the observations :

like small swarms of gaats. They seemed to start from a point in the south,

and emanated thence in all directions. He even saw some crossing in front

of the sun's disk when it was stiU low upon the horizon. Other persons, to
whom it was pointed out, also witnessed the phenomenon. It appears to have
been most brilliant at about 8'' 30" a.m. ; after 9'' a.m. nothing further was

perceived.

   " 'At Calmar* in Sweden,' according to the ' Ostsee Zeitung,' ' an un-
usually briUiaut star-shower was observed ; early in the morning, the Cal-

marsund was lighted up by thousands of falling meteors.'

Among the preparations for the display in 1867, a partially successful

attempt was made, on the occasion of this return of the November meteors,

by M. W. de Fonvielle to surmount the clouds, and to view the shower, at

Paris, in Mi-. Giffard's " captive balloon." Although the experiment was not

carried out on the night of the 13th-14th of November, a still more adven-

turous voyage, in a free balloon fiU'ed with pure hydrogen gas, and lent by

Mr. Giifard for the piu'pose, was commenced at Paris, under the guidance of

the same practical observer, M. de Fonvielle, accompanied by M. Jules Go-

dard as aeronaut, and M. A. V. Weyenberch, shortly before midnight on

the following evening, and tenninated at daybreak on the coast of Bel-

Agium.    star-chart, a telescope, a barometer, and other instruments for

observation were taken up; and although the height attained did not exceed

a few thousand feet, a clear atmosphere was reached, and observations were

obtained of several shooting-stars not visible to observers on the earth's

surface.

   Although the attempt to establish a floating observatory for observing the
meteoric display on the morning of the 14th of November last was obliged to

be abandoned, yet the experiment of the following night successfully proved

that the hindrance of clouds to the observation of shooting-stars can be re-

moved by means of balloon ascents on rare and important occasions of their

appearance. Ascents in balloons for scientific purposes, if arranged to take
place by night on the periodical star-shower dates of the 10th of August and
14th of November, might, on account of the extensive horizon visible from
such a great elevation, be the means of tracing to their origin in distant me-
teors the unaccountable flashes of light " like distant lightning " which,

however clear and fine the weather may be, are so often visible during the

appearance of a meteoric shower.

             III. Papers BEAnrye on Meteoeic Astronomy.

Among the discussions of interest in this branch of observation, the pro-

bable connexion of comets and shower-meteors was first reduced nearly to

a certainty by the publication of M. G. V. Schiaparelli's letters to Father

Secchi, in the Bullettino Meteorologico del Collegio Eomano, vol. v. Nos. 8,

10, 11, 12.

In the fii-st letter, M. SchiapareUi communicates some observations on the

August meteors of the years 1863 and 1866, made at Milan, to Avhich (in a

later letter) he applies the name of " Perseids " from the constellation which

Ausually contains their centre of divergence.  comparison of the average

horary increase in the frequency of meteors, throughout the year, from even-

ing until daybreak, with a mathematical formula for the same variation in

terms of their velocity, leads M. SchiapareUi in his opening letter to cou-

elude that the real average velocity of shooting-stars in their native orbits

round the sun is not far (1-447) from that of comets moving in parabolic
orbits, which is greater than the earth's mean orbital velocity at the same
distance from the sun in the proportion of 1*414 : 1.

    In the second letter the origin of meteoric currents is discussed, of which
more than fifty can be traced which have their points of radiation in the
northern hemisphere, and it is shown, by their various inclinations to the
ecliptic, and occasional retrograde motions, that shower-meteors rather re-
semble comets than planetary bodies indigenous to the solar system. Should
the meteoric groups come to the sun from stellar space, then, since the
Aug-ust meteors have been frequently observed since the date of their first
recorded appearance, in the year a.d. 830, they must compose streams of enor-
mous length. Supposing a cosmical cloud of meteoric bodies, of the sun's
size, to be moving in space transversely to its distance of, say, 20,000 times
the earth's distance fi'om the sun, with a velocity relatively to the sun of 100
yards per minute, in its approach to the sun it Avould pass near enough to
encounter the earth, and its orbit could not then be distinguished from a
parabola. It Avill be deformed in its course into a parabolic stream, reqmring
four months and a half to pass through its perihelion. At the middle of
that time its depth at that point wiU be only 100 yards, its width twenty-
three miles, and its density 400 million times its original density, while its
two extremities will reach in both dii'cctions almost up to the orbit of the

Aearth, nebula subtending, under the same initial circumstances as the last,

1' of arc would occupy more than 225 years in passing tlii'ough its perilielion.
Its depth would then be 36, and its width 13,800 miles. Its density would
be increased in the same proportion as before ; and its length along the para-
bolic orbit woidd reach, on both sides, four times the distance of Neptune from
 the sun. If the apparent diameter of the nebula were at first equal to that
 of the sun, it would occupy seven tlwusand years in passing through its

perihelion. In this way meteoric currents, enduring, like that of August, for

hundreds or even for thousands of years can be accounted for, whether their

motion may be direct or retrograde, or at whatever obliquities they arc in-

 clined to the ecliptic.

    In the third letter the origin of the November meteors is considered, and
 a summary is given of the new theory of shooting-stars.

    From the known weight of aerolites, and the absence of any solid residues

 on the occm-rence of even the greatest star-showers, the small mass of shoot-

 ing-stars may be certainly inferred. The grains of olivine disseminated in
 meteorites, regarded by M. Daubree as forming a kind of " universal scoria"
(see post), may not impossibly compose their nuclei, whose weight, at the
 most, can rarely exceed a few grains. At the earth's distance from the sun
 a swarm of such particles a few feet apart would be broken up by the sun's

 attraction into a stream in which each particle would pursue an independent
 orbit. Even in the densest meteoric showers the meteoric bodies are some
 scores of miles asunder, corresponding to thousands of miles apart in the
 distant nebula. The sun's attraction must, accordingly, gradually deform
 all meteor-clouds circidating within the solar system into a continuous
 stream or dosed ring ; and, on this account, the November star-shower is a
 recent group, derived from regions beyond the solar system.

    The new theory of shooting-stars is contained in the following proposi

 tions :

    ." I. Matter exists in space in every degree of subdivision. Masses nf the
 fii-st class are isolated stars, or stars collected together iu groups. Those of
A CATALOGUE OF OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.  395

the second class are clusters of small stars (or " star-dust " of Herschel), in

which class are mauj^ resolvable nebiilffi. The next class are smaller bodies,
"which become visible as comets when they approach the sun. The last class

of bodies, in the smallest state of subdivision, are cosmical clouds, composed

of bodies no larger than wo can handle or carry on the earth.
   " II. The last class of bodies may have originated from local concentra-

tions in space, in the same way that chemical substances crystallize from their
solutions. The appearance of the process of crystallization leads to the con-
jecture that this mode of concentration is more frequent and general than the
process by which larger masses have collected. The space occupied by the

cosmical clouds may, accordingly, constitute a large part of the intrastellar

regions.

    " III. The motions of such clouds relatively to the nsible bodies of the
universe are comparable to those of'the fixed stars, and probably attributable

to the same causes. When a cosmical cloud enters the sphere of the sun's

attraction, it can only become visible to us when its orbit about the sun is an

ellipse of very great excentricity.

   " IV. Whatever may be the shape and size of a cosmical cloud, it can

rarely enter the central parts of the solar system without being transformed

into a parabolic current, which may occupy years, centuries, or thousands of

years in completing its perihelion passage, in the form of a stream extremely
narrow in comparison with its length. Of such streams those which the
earth encounters in its annual revolution present themselves as a shower of

shooting-stars diverging fi'om a common centre of radiation.
    "V. The number of meteoric currents traversing the solar system in all

directions is probably very great. The extreme rarity of their materials
permits them to intersect each other mutually without disturbance. They
may gradually shift and change their form, like rivers which slowly change
their bed. They may be interrupted, so as to become double or multijjle.
 The November meteors are probably such a current in process of formation.

     " VI. Cosmical clouds having short periods of revolution round the sun,

 which have been assumed to explain the appearances of shooting-stars, can-

 not exist permanently without violating the laws of universal gravitation.
    "VII. The materials of parabolic currents, after passing through their

 perihelion, return to space in a state of greater dispersion than before their

perihelion passage. In particular cases, as when the current meets with a
 planet, such great perturbations of some of the meteors may arise as to di-
 vert them from the general track, into special orbits. Such meteors may,

 from that time, be properly called sporadic.
     " VIII. Shooting-stars and other like celestial bodies, which in the last

 century were regarded as atmospheric, which Olbers and Laplace first main-
 tained might be projected from the moon, and which afterwards came to be
 regarded as planetary bodies, are in reality bodies of the same class as the
 fixed stars ; and the name of falling stars, applied to them, simply expresses
 the real truth. They bear the same relation to comets which the planetoids
 between Mars and Jupiter bear to the larger planets, the smallness of lIjb
 masses, in both cases, being compensated for by the greatness of their number.

    " IX. Since it may certainly be assumed that shooting-stars, bolides, and
 aerolites only differ from each other in their comparative size, we may conclude

 that the substances fallen from the sky are samples of those of which the
 stellar imivcrse is composed ; and since in such masses no new chemical ele-

 ment has been discovered, hitherto unknown upon the earth, the similarity

  of composition of all the visible bodies of the universe, already rendered pro-

                                                                    2e2

   In the fourth letter M. SchiaparcUi traces a comiexiou between the ele-
ments of the orbits of the " Perseids," or of the long elliptic current of me-
teoric bodies which produce the August meteors, and those of the orbit cal-
culated by Oppolzer for the Comet III. 1862. The following comparion shows
that the two orbits arc nearly identical.

In the same letter M. Schiaparelli gives the elements of the elliptic orbit

of the November meteors, assuming their period to be 33-3 years.

The average real velocity of meteors found by M. Schiaparelli in his first

letter is nearly confirmed, from his o^vn observations, by Prof. Wolf, of Ziirich,

who, using the same formula of calculation, finds for its value 1-51, M. Schia-

parelli's result from nine similar scries of observations to those of Prof. Wolf

being 1-477. (Les Mondes, 2nd. scr. vol. xiii. p. 24.)

The publication of M. Schiaparelli's last letter was anticipated by Father

Secchi in his description of the November shower of meteors in 1866 (see

Les Mondes, 2nd ser. vol. xii. p. 647, 20th Dec. 1866), the fourth letter
only appearing in the monthly Number of the BuUcttino Meteorologico for the

31st of December, 1866, and the former letters in the Numbers for the pre-

vious months.

At a meeting of the Societe Scientifique de France on the 14th of January,

1867, and in a subsequent paper in the ' Comptes Rendus' (January 21st),

M. Le Verrier announced the introduction of the November meteoric group

into its present orbit  to  have been  probably effected  by the  planet  Uranus
                                                                                                                 ;

within a short distance of whose orbit the aphelion of the long elliptic orbit

of the meteors, with a period of 33-25 years, must be situated ; and the meteors

themselves must nearly have encountered the planet in the year a.d. 126.

Before that time their orbit may have been either within or beyond the re-

gions of the planetary orbits. M. Le Verrier adds that " there is nothing

to oblige us to suppose that the group did not originally belong to the solar

system." In later letters * M. Schiaparelli suggests that either of the two

planets Saturn or Jupiter, rather than Uranus (on account of the comparatively

small sphere of attraction of the latter planet being more calcv;lated to dis-

perse than to deflect a group of meteoroids from a very long elliptic into an

elliptic orbit of the sliort period of 33-25 years), may have been instrumental in

bringing the November meteors into their present close proximity to the earth.

It should, however, be observed that the meteoric group does not pass so near

the orbits, nor remain so long in the neighbourhood of either of those planets,

as it approaches to the planet Uranus, partly in consequence of the inclina-

tion of the orbit to the plane of the ecliptic, and partly because of the more

rapid motion of the meteors near the sun than at the point of their more dis-

tant appulse with the latter planet f-

A CATALOGUE OF OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS. 397

  A remarkable discovery was made shortly after these announcements, on

the publication (Astronomische Wachrichten, No. 1624) by Oppolzer, of the
corrected elements of the Comet I. 1866, that the orbit of the comet coin-
cides almost perfectly with the long elliptic orbit of the jSTovember meteors
having a period of 33-25 years. The note of Mr. Peters, dated January the
20th, is in the same No. 1624 of the 'Astronomische Nachrichten;' and those of
Oppolzer and Schiaparelli, announcing the same discovery, are in an imme-
diately following Number (1626) of the same Journal. In 'Les Mondes' for
the 21st of February (2nd scr. vol. siii. p. 287), and in Father Secchi's
Bullettino Meteorologico for the last day of February 1867 (vol. vi. No. 2),
there appeared additional letters of M. Schiaparelli on the subject of this
second newly found connexion between comets and meteoric showers.

   In that addressed to ' Les Mondes ' *, a convincing comparison of the ele-
ments of the two orbits is thus given by M. Schiaparelli, viz. :

Elements of the Orbits of the November Meteors, and of Comet I.

   To establish the reality of this resemblance, it was desirable to place beyond
a doubt the assumed correctness of the long elliptic orbit of the November
meteors with a periodic time of 33-25 years. The researches of Professor
Adams, with this object in view, which appeared in the ' Monthly Notices of
the Eoyal Astronomical Society ' for March 1867, are thus noticed by Prof. H.

A. Newton t, by whom the importance of this inquiry was first pointed out, in

a paper noticed in these Keports (for 1864, p. 96) on " the original accounts
of the displays in former times of the November Star-showers, and the pro-
bable orbit of the group of bodies around the Sun."

   " It was shown some time ago (this Joitrnal, II. xxxviii. 57) that the pe-
riodic time of the November meteors must be one of five accurately determined
periods. These five periods were 180-0 days, 185-4 days, 354-6 days, 376-6
days, and 33-25 years. The longitude of the node was also shown to increase
with respect to the ecliptic l'-711 in a year, which is equivalent to a procession
with respect to the fixed stars of 29' in a cycle of 33-25 years. It was also
suggested that by computing the secular motion of the node for each one of

the five possible orbits, and by comparing it with the observed motion, we

have an apparently simple means of deciding which of the five orbits is the

true one.

   " Soon after the remarkable display of the meteors in November of last
year J, Prof. Adams undertook the examination of this question. Taking-
first the orbit corresponding to a periodic time of 354-6 days, he found that

the action of Jupiter produces an annual increase of the longitude of the node
equal to 6", and that of Venus an annual increase equal to 5". The action

of the earth was not so easily computed, owing to the intersection of the two

orbits. An approximate solution applicable to this case showed, however,

an annual increase of the longitude of the node of about 10" due to this
cause. The whole computed procession of the node was therefore about 21"

a year, or 12' in the cycle of 33*25 years.

   " The periodic time 376-6 days gives a result not widely different from the
above, while in the two smaller orbits there would be a much smaller motion.

Hence these foiu' orbits, oiit of the five possible ones, are incompatible with

the observed motion of the node.
   " Computing, then, the effect of the perturbing action of the planets upon the

group, supposing it to have a periodic time of 33-25 years. Prof. Adams found

that Jupiter increases the longitude of the node 20' in one revolution, that

Saturn  increases  it  7',  and  Uranus  increases  it  1'            the other planets produce
                                                                   ;

hardly any sensible effect ; so that the entii-e calcidated increase of the lon-

gitude of the node in the period of 33-25 years is about 28'. The observed

increase during the same time is 29'. This remarkable accordance between

the results of theory and observation appears to leave no doubt as to the cor-

rectness of the period of 33-25 years."

Supposing a meteor-current to be the regular concomitant of a comet,

whose presence on the same orbit with the comet can only be perceived at a

point of encounter with the earth, a hst of those comets whose orbits most

nearly approach the orbit of the earth, was prepared by Dr. Weiss, of Vienna,

(Astrou. Nachi-ichteu, No. 1632). The distance of such a comet fi'om the

sun in the ecliptic (?·), at the place of its ascending ( g3 ) or descending
node (?S), is nearly equal to the earth's distance (supposed unity) from the

sun at the instant of its nodal passage through the plane of the comet's orbit.

The following list contains the data thus obtained by Dr. "Weiss.

--as indicating very probably a physical connexion between this comet and

the cui-rent of the April meteors.

   Two recently discovered periodical comets being thus pretty certainty

shown to be connected with the material currents which give rise to the
Augiist and November meteors, and two others being very probably identified
with the meteor-currents of April and December, the community of origin
(frequently believed by writers of late years to exist) between shooting-stars
and comets appears to be conclusively established.

   To assist the observation of luminous meteors, a first catalogue of shooting-
stars observed in Ital}' during the years 1866-67 was published at Milan in
July of last year, by M. Hehiaparclli. The principal object being to ascer-
tain the positions of their radiant-points, certain nights of the year were
named beforehaud by M. Schiaparelli for simiiltaneous observations, in order
to multiply, as far as possible, the number of separate meteors recorded by
observers coojjerating to register their tracks at distant stations on a single
night. The first portion of the catalogue consists, almost entirely, of 572
observations of meteors, made b}^ M. G. Zezioli, assistant director of the
telegraph -office ,at Bergamo, between the 26th of April and the 10th of

July, 1867.

--404 REPORT 1868.

    Mr. Greg having undertaken the projection of M. Zezioli's observations
on the appropriate guomonic star-charts of the British Association, several

new radiants were discovered, and the positions and durations of old ones

were found to be confirmed, and of others to require only inconsiderable cor-
rections, of which the shortuess of the nights and the consequent scarcity of
meteor-observations in England during the summer months had hitherto

prevented the determination with precision.
    The preceding list of radiant-points of the northern hemisphere, corrected

and enlarged, by means of the additional observations, from that formerly
printed in these Reports (for 1864, p. 99), is extracted from a new edition
of the Atlas of plane-perspective Meteor-charts (for 1868) of the Luminous-
Meteor Committee of the British Association, which will, this year, bo offered
for sale by members of the Committee, at the price of lithographing copies of
the Atlas, or of single charts, according to the wants and occasional require-
ments of observers *.

   Besides the observations of shooting-stars now mentioned, which M,

Schiaparelli has lately published in the Milan ' Ephemeris of Astronomy,'
three memoirs on shooting-stars observed in Piedmont during the August
and November star-showers of 1866-67 1, by Eather F. Denza, Director of
the Observatory at Moncalicri, near Turin, contain useful abstracts of obser-
vations, and notices of recent papers on meteoric astronomy, together with

instructions for future systematic observations of meteors at various stations

in Piedmont.

    The following list of radiant-points in the southern hemisphere (p. 405),
compiled by Professor Hcis from nearty 2000 observations of shooting-stars
made by Dr. Neumayer at the Elagstaff Observatory at Melbourne, is taken
from the Table at the end of the third of Eather Denza's memoirs J. No
great star-shower Avas recorded by Dr. Neumayer as having been seen at
Melbourne during the period of five years (1858-03) in which the observa-

tions were carried on.
    Professor Hcis regards the observations discussed and reduced in this list

as of peculiar importance, on account of the care with which the apjjarent
paths and the apparent size, colour, duration, etc. of the meteors were

recorded. Thirty-five new radiant-points arc developed in the southern

hemisphere, and the positions of four previously established radiant-points
(S , ^, , g) are corroborated, by the observations, and ai'c included in the
southern list. Some of the radiant groups sufficiently resemble those obtained

by Professor Heis as the result of his own indefatigable labours in the

northern hemisphere, or those assigned for the same hemisphere by Mr. Greg,
so as to make in these cases a further investigation of especial interest.

   * The sale of the maps, at a rather higher price (owing to the expense of drawing three
new charts and rclithopraphinf; llie olil plates for the new edition of the Atlas) than
would make them accessible to the majority of observers, was this year begun at Norwich,
by the agents (Messrs. Taylor and Francis) for the sale of the volumes of these Reports.
Four copies of the Atlas were thus sold to members of the Association at Norwich ; and

 the remaining sixteen copies struck off for the occasion of the Meeting, to represent this

edition of the Atlas, are kept on hand for the use of British and foreign observers, for whom

the price is reduced to 25.';. for a single copy. The Committee are unable to oifer copies
to observers at a lower price, on account of the large number of copies of the Meteor-Atlas
which were last year .sent, gratis, to the foregoing destin.itions (see the list on p. 400).

almost intermediate in position, and a little earlier in date of its appearance,
with respect to each of them. It may, accordingly, be regarded as the com-
mencement of either of those showers, or even as the starting-point of a

Uwhole series of showers Y, S, T, which have their centi-es of divergence,

in autumn, in the vicinity of the equator. The new radiant-points X,, ^

(the latter in the constellation Cetus), in October and November, are also not
impossibly allied appearances, and the latter, perhaps, a continuation of the

last radiant of the group U, near d Ceti.

   Among the radiant-points in the new list which (like that of the November

meteors iu the northern hemisphere) lie closest to the tangential apex of the

earth's way, two especially may be noticed in the southern hemisphere, viz.

   Of these groiips the greater number are either near the equator or else near

the parallel of the declination of the zenitli at Melbourne, about 38° S. decli-
nation. Only one radiant-point, viz. P, in July, is found iu the vicinity of
the South Pole of the heavens : whUe, on the contrary, in the northern he-
misphere a large proportion of the radiant-points visible throughout the year
are either situated very near to the North Pole of the heavens, or are circum-

polar. Were a series of meteor -observations in the southern hemisphere
to be continued over as great a number of years as that which has been
carried out in the northern hemisphere, it is probable that the number of
radiant- points discovered would not only be increased, but also be found
distributed more uniformly over the sky than those which have now been

assigned to it, and whose positions are indicated in the present list.
A CATALOGUE OF OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.                       407

No star-showers were observed at Melbourne during the epochs (for the

northern hemisphere) of the 2nd of January, 19th-21st of April, 18th of Octo-

ber, 13th-14th of November, and 3rd-13th of December, during the five-

year period of the observations, from 1858 to 1862. The months of June,
July, and August are regarded by Dr. Neumayer as particularly rich, with

respect to the hourly frequency of meteors. Many fine meteors were seen on

board of the frigate ' Novara,' on the voyage fi'om Funchal to Eio Janeiro,

between the 27th of July aud the 2nd of August, 1857. An unusual number

of meteors was also seen at Melbourne towards the end of February and be-

tween the 8th and 17th of May in the year 1859. A notable number of

shooting-stars aud fii-ebaUs was seen at Victoria on the night of June 12--13,

A1861.  great number were also seen by M. Poey at Havannah, on the

nights of the 27th and 28th of July 1862. Maxima of frequency of shooting-

--stars, in various years of the interval from 1858 to 1862, were observed at

Melboiu'ue on the following dates : Jan. 28-reb. 2, Mar. 12-15, May 8-17,

June 3-14, July 27-Aug. 2, Aug. 5-7, Oct. 25, Dec. 6, 12, 18, and 25.

The average hourly frequency, for the different months of the year, given

in the memoir, differs in a very small degree from the results of the Melbourne

observations as formerly stated in these Reports*.

Particular accounts of several large meteors recorded in the southern con-

tinent of Australia are included in the memoir, which have either been de-

scribed in these Reports t, or for which the original memoir must be consiilted

for special details of their description.

 --" Notes and Eeflections on the Astronomical Theory of Falling Stars,"

by G. Y. SchiaparelliJ. ^In continuation of his former letters to Father

Secchi on the orbits and probable origin of luminous meteors, Professor

Schiaparelli last year resumed the subject, in a memoir read before the Flo-
rentine Academy of Sciences, containing additional notes and mathematical

considerations of importance on the astronomical theory of shooting-stars.

According to the best received hypothesis which existed before the dis-

covery of their connexion with comets, the sun was regarded as surrounded

by a series of meteoric rings, one of which, that of the November meteors§,

returning once in a cycle of about 33-25 years, contains a principal group of

meteors collected in one portion of its circumference, the remaining portions of

the annulus being either nearly free from or totally devoid of meteors. Star-

showers of annual occurrence lilce that of the 10th of August, present the
phenomenon of a nearlj^ continuous stream of meteors, varying only slightly

in density in its different parts ; while those which appear, at uncertain

intervals of years, on the 2nd of January aud 20th of April, must form a

discontinuous stream of meteoric bodies, consisting of meteor groups ii-regu-

larly distributed along its length, and separated from each other by inter-

vening gaps. Finally, those isolated appearances described in catalogues as

great star-showers of former times, which are not known to have returned,

and the modem star-showers of the 12th of December, including, perhaps,

among its appearances the great display of meteors observed by Brandos on

   § The term "Leonids,'' if applied to this shower as radiating from some point in the
constellation Leo. may, not improperly, be used to dislinguisli it from other meteors ajjpear-
ing simultaneously with it, as Professor Schiaparelli has applied the term '· Perseids " to
indicate the meteors of the 10th of August which radiate from some point in the constel-

lation Perseus. Mme. Scarpellini has employed the word "uranatmi" (sidereal exhala-

tions) to designate shower-meteors generally.
                                                                         --

the 6th of December 1798, of which no former record a^jpears to he pre-

served, must rather have been temporarily, and, in the latter case, recentlj'

introduced into the solar system from Avithout.

The real form and extent, and the mode of the production, of meteoric

rings would thus remain uncertain, if the recent discovery of their affinity

with periodic comets had not to some extent revealed their history, and

removed, at length, one chief obscurity from the theory of meteor rings

that is to say, their frequent retrograde motions, and great obliquities to the

ecliptic, of which the nebular hj^pothesis of Laplace, when it is attempted

to be applied to explain their origin, can give no account.

The two principal meteoric showers, of August and November, and pro-

bably also those of April and December, having been recently identified in

their orbits with the orbits of certain periodic comets, one of which performs

its revolution, with a periodic time of upwards of 400 years, in an orbit ex-

tending, at its greatest distance, twice as far as the furthest planet, Neptune,

from the sun, the community of origin of comets aud shower-meteors, at

first suspected, now appears to be finally established. It is stated in the first
chapter of Professor SchiapareUi's memoir as the new astronomical theory of

luminous meteors, about to be further developed and applied to the explana-

tion of their phenomena.

In the second and third chapters some points of the theory of the atmo-

spherical origin of meteors are regarded as requiring special consideration and

discussion. Deviations from uniform motion, such as crooked paths * and

changes of velocity, regarded b^^ M. Coulvier-Gravier as the efiects of violent

air-currents, are shown to arise from the resistance of the air to the original

motion of the meteors. The diurnal variation of frequency, noticed by M.

Coulvier Gravier, and the similar annual variation, also observed by him, by

Dr. Schmidt, Dr. Wolf, and by others, together with the variations of the

average dii-ection of meteors throughout the day, or year, are shown to have

no dii'cct connexion with meteorological changes, but to correspond to the

varying altitude and azimuth of the apex of the eartWs wai/, from which the
greater number of meteors are directed.

Formulas for calculating the amount of these periodical variations led Prof.

SchiaparcUi, in his first letter to Father Secchi, to regard the real velocity of

meteors as identical with that of bodies revolving in parabolic orbits round

the sun. They were similarly investigated and employed by Professor

Newton in pointing out the resemblance of the orbits of shooting-stars to

Athose of comets.  popular account of the phenomena of meteoric variations

is given at the conclusion of the chapter, by supposing a " meteoric sun," or

--central radiant-point of shooting-stars, to be situated at the apex of the

earth's way whose rising and setting produce a meteoric morning and

evening, and its culminations a meteoric noon and night, six hours before the

corresponding changes of the sun. A meteoric spring and autumn, summer

and winter are a conseqiience of the varj-ing declination (or meridian altitude)

of the same " meteoric sun," and accordhigly follow three months after the

corresponding tropical seasons of the year.

   * or meteors with decidedly crooked paths, M. Coulvier-GraTier reckons that about tbrec

such meteors are visible in every thousand. Meteors with decidedly serpentine flights were

only observed by liim three or four times in the course of many years. M. Schiaparelli

fm'ther suggests that the helix, or spiral curve in which small strips of card, '2 inches long
and ^ inch wide, descend through the air when let fall from a height, combined with the
foreshortening and exaggerating effects of perspective, faitlifully represents all the peculiari-
ties of curved and retarded ilight occasionally observed in shooting-stars.
            A CATALOGUE OF OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS. 409

    In the fourth and fifth chapters, the positions of all the known radiant-

 points of the northern hemisphere, with respect to the terrestrial apex, are
projected by Prof. Schiaparelli on a single planisphere, having the pole of the
ecliptic at the centre, and the sun and anthelion, and the apex and anti-
apex, at the four points of the ecliptic, in the border of the planisphere. It
thus appears that, owing to the generally low position of the sun beneath the
horizon during the time of the observations, no radiant-points within 60°,
and only twelve radiant-points within 90° of the sun have been observed, the
remaining thirty-nine radiant-points belonging to the anti-solar hemisphere,
a large portion of which, at night, was in the observer's view throughout

the time. On the other hand, thirty-one points of radiation of shower-

meteors are found within 90° of the apex, and only twenty occur within 90°
of the anti-apex of the earth's way*, although the apex was seldom seen
above, and the anti-apex was rarely hidden below the horizon during the
observations. The practical results of observation, therefore, confirm the

supposition that the apex of the earth's way is also an apex of concentration

of meteoric showers, and that consequently the " resultant," or average
flight of meteors, taken collectively throughout the whole year, is from the

direction of that apex.

   No trace of confonnity to the ecliptic, or other signs of connexion of the

radiant-points with each other or with great circles of the sky, can be de-

tected, which would materially facilitate precise calculation of the diurnal
and annual variations, if certain other elements of abundance of the meteors
of particular showers were satisfactorily determined.

    Allowing for the effects of the earth's velocity in its orbit, in assembling
the apparent positions of the radiant-points of shower-meteors about that
point of the echptic towards which the earth moves, and for the greater

chances of vision of small comets when moving in direct orbits nearly coin-
ciding with the ecliptic plane, than of those whose orbits are more inclined,
or retrograde, Prof. SehiapareUi considers that both comets and meteors

are distributed without any preponderance towards the plane of the ecliptic,
and that they exhibit no prevailing tendency towards a direct rather than

towards a retrograde motion in their orbits.

   The real mean velocity of shooting-stars may be determined from that of

comets in their orbits, at their points of intersection with the orbit of the
earth, which is 25-70 B. S. miles per second ; while that of the earth in its

orbit is only 18-18 miles per second*. Adding and subtracting these num-
bers, the greatest and least mean relative velocities of meteors which en-
counter the earth (respectively, moving to meet it directly, or to overtake it),

no account being taken of the earth's attraction, are 43-88 and 7-52 miles
per second. The effect of the earth's attraction is greater in the latter case
than in the former (in the proportion of 5 : 1), and increases the mean
greatest and least relative velocities of shooting-stai-s respectively to 44-43

and 10-23 miles per second, which are to each other in the proportion of
4-34 : 1. Supposing, then, that the whole vis viva of meteors is converted
into heat and light, the heat developed on the surface of those which move
to meet the earth directly is greater than that developed by meteors which
 directly overtake it, in the proportion of 19 : 1. It foUow^s that the light
and also the number of meteors in the former case visible to the naked eye
wHl be proportionately greater than those in the latter ; and should two
 meteorites of exactly eqiial masses penetrate the atmosphere, one of them
 moving from the direction of the apex of the earth's Avay -with the mean

maximum velocity of meteors relatively to the earth, and the other from the
opposite direction with the mean minimiun velocity, the former meteorite
may be totally volatilized, while the latter may reach the earth with a por-
tion of its substance imconsumed, and may produce an aerolitic fall. In this
 manner Prof. SehiapareUi accounts for a fact which may at least be regarded

 as pretty well established t, that the greater number of aerolitic falls take
 place in the afternoon and evening hours of the day, although meteoric
 phenomena, generally, are then least vivid or abitndant, because at that time,
 which corresponds to meteoric night, the anti-apex of the earth's way is at its
 highest point above the visible horizon, and the meteoric showers which then
 make their appearance are for the most part moving in direct orbits, so as to
 overtake the earth with the minimum meteoric speed.

     Although no aerolites are precipitated from the meteor-currents of the
 " Perseids " and " Leonids," the elongations of whose radiant-points from the

 of the earth and of particular meteors may differ sensibly from the mean value. Thus, for
 Biela's comet, whose periodic time of revolution is 67 years, the elliptic velocity at the
 point where it crosses the earth's orbit is l-14th part less than that of a parabolic orbit, or
 about 23-9 B. S. miles per second. The reiil velocity of the November meteors at the same
 point in their orbits is about 2507 miles per second.

apex of the earth's way are only 38° and 10° respectively, yet other circum-
apical meteoric streams may give rise to aerolitic falls. The annual varia-
tion of fi'equency of aerolites is not nearly so marked as the corresponding

law of their diurnal variation * ; and this would actually be the case, if the
materials of a few meteor-currents near the apex should, occasionally, produce

aerohtic falls.

   The sixth chapter contains some propositions relative to the eifects of the
earth's motion, and of its attraction, during its appulse with meteoric currents.

DSupposing to be the real density or number of meteors per minute of a

shower of shooting-stars which would fall on a single horizon exposed ver-
tically to it luere the earth at rest, z the apparent zenith-distance, and e the
apparent elongation of the radiant-point of the shower from the apex of the
earth's way, then, considering the real velocity of meteors to be that of
bodies moving in parabolic orbits, and to be unaffected by the earth's attrac-
tion, the apparent density d, or the number of meteors actually observed per
minute, is given by the formula

                                                    cZ=D cos cv'f + V 2 cose,

and wiU generally depend on the apparent angular distance of the radiant-

point from the zenith of the observer, and from the apex of the earth's way.

The frequency of the meteors will be greatest when the radiant -point coin-

cides with the apex of the earth's way, and when both points are in the

observer's zenithf. Applying the formula to calciilate the real density of

the meteors ia the great shower of the 13th and 14th of November 1866,

from the apparent density (123 meteors per minute) as observed at Green-

wich, making r=65°, e=10°, the value of D, or the real density of the

stream for the observers of the shower at Greenwich, is found to be 171

meteors per minute. The effect of the earth's motion through the swarm, in

increasing the frequency of the meteors, was thus much more than counter-

balanced by the low position of the radiant-point, tending to reduce their

apparent number. Had the latter point been in the zenith, the number of

meteors recorded in a miuute would have been 291, instead of 123, as ob-

served, and would greatly have increased the splendour of the display.

   The effect of the earth's attraction cannot always be neglected J, as it de-

flects the parallel courses of the meteors into hyperbolic curves. And those

meteors are most deflected which just graze the earth's atmosphere, and

which overtake it with the slowest speed from the direction of the anti-apex

the total deflection in this case, on leaving the sj)here of the earth's attrac-

tion, is  34° 40'                                   meteors so diverted from their original course become truly

sporadic, and their radiant-region must speedily grow diffuse; but in the

case of a meteor-current arriving from the direction of the apex, the total

deviation  cannot                                   exceed  1° 24'                            while for meteor- currents having their

apparent points of divergence midway between these points, or situated 90°

from the apex, the greatest possible deviation is 7° 56'. As the meteors of

the 13th-14th of November diverge nearly from the apex of the earth's

way, and a second deflection of the same meteors to the utmost extent of

1° 28' is very unlikely to take place, the great accuracy of divergence of the

meteors of this shower from a well-defined radiant-point is readily explained.

Meteors which penetrate the atmosphere are deflected downwards ; and the

apparent position of their radiant-point is deflected upwards to an extent

depending on its zenith-distance, by the same cause, termed by Prof. Schia-

parelli the zenithal attraction--vfhich. follows a law very similar to that of

atmospheric refraction, in displacing the apparent position of the radiant-

point upwards, towards the observer's zenith. The apparent displacement
disappears at the zenith, and reaches its greatest value at the horizon, where

it may amount in extreme cases to 17° 20'; so that a radiant-point may

change its apparent place in the sky (from the efi'ects of the earth's attrac-

tion alone) 34° 40' in twelve hours, between the times of its rising above the

Ahorizon in the east point and setting below it in the west.  correction for

zenithal attraction is therefore necessary to be applied to the observed posi-
tions of all radiant-points whose elongation is greater than 90° from the apex

of the earth's way ; and formulae for its calculation, in every case, are given

at pp. 56, 57 of the memoir.
   The seventh chapter gives an account of the perturbations produced by

the earth and the other planets on meteoric swarms with which they

come in contact, or which pass in their immediate neighbourhood. Meteors

moving in parabolic orbits, which overtake the earth with the least possible

relative velocity, may, under the most favourable circumstances, be diverted

into ellipses of periodic times varjdng from 4} to 120 years or upwards,

according as they just graze the earth's atmosphere, or pass at a distance of

ten or more earth's radii from its centre. The greatest effect, however, of

the earth's attraction on meteors of the November shower is no greater than
would alter their periodic time from its present value to 28-67, or to 49-92

years in opposite cases. Since such effects can rarely accumulate, the No-

vember meteors can never be diverted into open orbits by the earth's attrac-

tion, but will continue to circulate in ellipses, intersecting the earth's orbit,

as at present, with little variation, about the earth's place on the 14th of

November.

With regard to their introduction into the solar system, it is shown that,

on account of the very small difterence (y^^ part of the whole) which must

exist between the semiaxes major of the foremost and rearmost members of

the meteoric group, suj^posing it to have reached its present extension in its

orbit since the year a.d. 902, its actual diameter, if introduced into the

solar system by the planet Uranus, could not have exceeded 168 miles.
Should its diameter before encountering Uranus have been as much as 600

miles, it mlist have revolved previously in an ellipse with a periodic time of

not more than fifty years, which is as inconceivable as that it should have

always continued to revolve without any disturbance in its present course.

Should the planets Jupiter or Saturn have effected a diversion of the group

from a long elliptic or parabolic orbit into its present path, the possible

limits of its original dimensions are much wider, but are stiU confined to a

few earth's radii, supposing that the present track of the group could have

brought them sufficiently near to those planets to fall within the extreme

--boundaries of their attractions that is to say, within 10-19 radii of the

globe of Saturn from its centre, or within 27-27 radii from the centre of the

planet Jupiter. The results of this chapter accordingly tend to confirm the

opinion urged by Faye*, that the group of the November meteors must have

originally formed part of the nucleus of Tempel's comet.

regarding the concentration of an original nebulous matter* into celestial

bodies of the various forms and characters visible in the universe, when ap-

plied to the case of shooting-stars, has broiight to light the following con-

clusions, viz. (1) the ^production of meteoric streams, (2) tJie affinity of their
orbits luith those of comets, (3) the presence of comets in them forming an in-

tegrant part of certain meteor-currents. Many important considerations are

here, accordingly, introduced.

In the first place, in the opinion of Faye, meteor-currents may arise from

the dispersion of the nucleus of comets, which Laplace regarded as small

portions of the nebulous matter of Hersdhel overtaken by the sun's attraction

in space t. Meteoric clouds Professor Schiaparelli considers to be of exactly
the same origin but at the same time of greater extent and tenuity than the

nuclei of comets, and, finally, that they assume the form of meteoric currents

when (under the influence of the sun's attraction) they approach the interior

Aportion of the solar system.   few general calculations, at the outset,

are therefore given, to show what relations the dimensions and the du-

ration of the perihelion passage of the meteoric currents must bear to the

original extent and distance of the meteoric clouds, on the supposition that

the mutual attractions of their particles may be neglected. It may, how-

ever, be shown that if two gravitating spheres, composed of imcohering par-

ticles, are placed close together, one of them incomparably smaller than the
other, and revolving round it in an orbit, the attraction of the larger sphere
will overcome the mutual attraction, and distribute the particles of the smaller
sphere in the form of a current along its orbit, unless the smaller sphere has

at least t^yice the density of the larger one. Supposing the sun's mass to be

extended into a sphere of the same radius as the earth's orbit, it will contain

2-3 grains weight of matter per cubic yard, which is the density of common

-^air at a barometric pressure of about  part of an inch (-00337 in.)

of mercury. Twice this density is therefore the least density which a come-

tary body can have at the earth's distance from the sun, without undergoing

gradual deformation by the sun's attraction into an elongated current. In
the case of meteoric clouds, which are of extreme tenuity, and have no nu-

cleus, or only such a small nucleus as the November meteors appear to pos-

sess in Tempel's comet, the deformation is certain to take place ; but in the

case of certain comets which appear to possess a nucleus of considerable

density, their parts may remain connected throughout their perihelion pas-

sage, or at least will not be permanently separated until they approach within

a certain distance from the sun. The first steps of deformation of the group

of the November meteors may accordingly not have commenced until they

were deflected into their present orbit by the forcible attraction of one of the

superior planets ; and a part of the same group appears still to retain its ori-

ginal compact form in the gaseous mass of Tempel's comet J.
   In this view, comets and meteoric showers are portions of the nebulous

matter in space in two diiFerent states of condensation (comets or meteors),

which may either arise together or apart, according to the tenuity of the mat-

t The occasional smallness of comets may be gathered from a singular observation by
Jahn (Astronomische Naclirichten, vol. xxiii. p. 2-37) of a comet vrith three tails, which, on

the 3rd of July, 184.5, described an arc of nearly 40° in about 26 minutes, during which

it remained visible. This comet must have passed very close to the earth, and must have

been of very small dimensions. (Schiaparelli's Memoir, p. 106.)

ter which produced them. Such differences are observed in the nebulae, of
which some are resolvable and others not resolvable in the telescope ; and a
similar distinction is shown to exist in the nebula) by the spectroscope.

    Comets with two or more nuclei, sometimes resembling a congeries of
stars, have not uncommonly been observed. Of such observations several
descriptions, illustrated by engravings (see fig. 1), are cited, for the details of
which the reader is referred to the original memoir (p. 94-101). The ex-
traordinary comet of 1652, witnessed by Hevelius (fig. 2), consisted of a
disk of pale light of the apparent diameter of the full moon, with hardly any
perceptible tail, and, in the telescope, it appeared filled with points of light.

A large proportion of shooting-stars are, in fact, telescopic ; and a display of

 dififused light is said sometimes to accompany a meteoric shower,

   How, then, can the v\r) of Anaxagoras, or the nebuloiis matter of Herschel
become condensed into bodies of such various characters, except it be from

a state of highly heated vapour, gradually undergoing a process of cooling
and condensiug of its parts ? Groups of more or less comminuted particles,
or compact nuclei would thus result, according as the original form of the
heated cloud was that of a filament or thin extended disk, or a sphere. Not
only the various features of star-showers and comets, but even the mine-
ralogical structure of aerolites, whose crystals appear to have been deposited
from a heated vapour, to have been broken up, and to have, in some cases,
again undergone metamoi'phism by heat, before they were finally consoli-
dated, appear to be explained on this supposition. The theory of Paye, that
they are developed from the nuclei, and of Seechi, that they are the remnants
of the tails, and of Erman, that they are particles detached from comets by a

resisting medium, are not so immediately referable to the known laws of

gravitation as the hypothesis that all classes of luminous meteors, like comets
themselves, are drawn towards the sun by its attraction from the regions of
intrasteUar space, which the telescope declares to be empty, but which, in
all probability, are strewed with cosmical clouds, containing in one order of
phenomena both meteoroids and comets.

astronomers the Ger/enschein, of which M. SchiapareUi has himself frequently

corroborated the appearance at Milan. It will be sufficient to notice, ia

closing the present abstract, that the result of the investigation is not favour-

able to the assumption that the outer portion of the zodiacal light consists of
solid bodies, shining by borrowed light which they reflect to us from the sun.

   " Synthesis of Meteorites." By M. Daubree (Comptes llendus, 1866, Jan.
29-March 19, vol. Ixii. pp. 200, 2G9, 660).--By the help of a high heat*,

in one of the gas-manufactory furnaces of ^'"augirard, supjjlied with gas-coke,

M. Daubre'e succeeded in liquifying the intractable materials of upwards of

thirty different aorolitic falls. After solidifying, the fused mass was found

to consist of a vitrified slag in the case of the three unique meteorites of
Juvenasf, Jonzac, and Stannern, which differ from the ordinary type of

aerolites in the presence of alumina. The magnesian or common type of

aerolites, on the other hand, separates on cooling into two distinct and regu-

larly ciystaUized minerals, one of which forms a pellicle of square-based,

octahedral, or occasionally lamellar crystals, and is peridot, or protosUicate
of magnesia. The meteorite of Chassigny consists entirely of this mineral,
with a small percentage of chrome-iron ore. The other mineral, of which
the meteorite of BishopvUle is almost entirely composed, is enstatite, or

bisilicate of magnesia. It crosses the centre of the mass, apparently on ac-

count of its greater fusibility, in groups of long square prisms, of very per-

fect form, and generally in one dii-ection. The crucibles being lined with

charcoal to preserve the contents from contact with the air, a portion of the

iron contained as sUicate is reduced ; and the silica set free, combining with

a portion of the peridot, thereby increases the quantity of enstatite. The

ease with which these two minerals crystallize from the liquid state makes

it probable, as supposed by Mr. Sorby, that the confused mass of very small

broken and imperfect crystals of which the magnesian aeroUtes consist must
have been deposited by sublimation, like flour of suljjhur, from a state of
heated vapoiir.

In order to test the affinity of terrestrial rocks with aerolites in this re-

spect, several magnesian silicates were fused, and those which gave results

--most similar to those of aerolites were found to be, 1", Peridot from the

basalts of Langeac (Haute Loire) ; 2°, Peridotic hypersthene from Labrador

3°, and especially, Lherzolite (a mineral found at many places in the Pyrenees)

from Prades, consisting of a mixture of the magnesian minerals of peridot,

enstatite, and pyroxene. The result of fusion of these rocks, in the pre-

sence of charcoal, is exactly similar to that of aerolites : the two magnesian
silicates contained in them crystallize separately ; and the reduced u'on ex-

tracted from the mass contains a proportion of nickel, which, as shown by

Stromeyer, is present, with phosphates (found by G. liose, and by M. C. St.-

Claire Deville in Vesuvian lavas), as well as chromite, in most of the basic

Arocks which spring from a source below the granite.  phosphate (apatite)

was also found by Eammelsbcrg, together with titanium, in the rare aluminic

meteorite of Juvenas ; but the presence of titanium in meteoi'ites of the com-

mon or magnesian type was first discovered by M. Daubree, in the course of

his experimental fusions of the meteorites of Moutrcjau and Aumale.

Several attempts to imitate meteoric iron by fusion were partially suc-

cessful, as in the liquefaction and reduction of Iherzohte and the peridot of

Langeac. The fusion of iron alloyed with nickel and phosphuret of iron
produced reticulated figures on the etched sections, which, although not so
regular as those of Widmanstatten, were yet perfectly distinct. The forma-
tion of small spherules of bisilicate was also repeatedly noticed in the re-
sults of terrestrial fusions, which are abundant in certain aerolites; while
the graphitic-looking friction-planes met with in many meteorites could be
perfectly imitated, by rubbing together fragments of the reduced iron-bear-

ing residue of the fusion of terrestrial rocks.

  --The serpentine or hydrated class of maguesian rocks were next submitted

to experiment fii'st, in crucibles lined with calcined magnesia, and afterwards
 alone. The result in the first case is a perfectly crystalline peridot, and in

the second case a group of mixed crystals of peridot and enstatite. When

 the crucibles are lined with charcoal, the resulting mass contains a highly
 nickeliferous metallic iron*. Most of the serpentines also contain chromite,
 which was first pointed out by Laugier as an ingredient of the most constant
 and regular occurrence in meteorites.

    Serpentine, basaltic peridot, and Iherzolite may accordingly be regarded
 as the chief terrestrial rocks of a meteoric type. With granite and gneiss,

--the two staple foundations of the earth's crust, meteorites have no features

 in common, neither orthose, felspar, mica, quartz (the meteoric iron of To-
 luca, according to G. Rose, alone excepted), tourmaline, nor any of the com-

 mon granitic silicates being found in them. But they agree closely with

 those basic rocks whose origin is deeper-seated than the granite, and which
 only reach the surface in volcanic eruptions. They consist most largely of
 peridot, which is, perhaps, only entirely absent from the three aluminiferous
 meteorites already mentioned. Its great specific gravity and general distri-
 bution in volcanic rocks, its avidity for silica (directlj" opposed to granite as
 the most basic of all the known silicates), and lastly, its abundant occur-
 rence in aerolites appear to constitute the character of peridot as the true
  " universal scoria."

     Inasmuch as carbon, in the form of graphite, is rarely found in meteoric
 iron, it could not be the reducing agent to which aerolites appear to owe
  their low degree of oxidation ; while their reduction by hydrogen would give
 rise to the formation of water and of hydrates, which are only known to
  exist, as M. Woliler has shown, in the carbonaceous meteorites of Orgueil,
 Kaba, and Cold Bokkeveldt. To explain the presence of such ingredients as
  metallic iron and unoxidized sulphur and phosphorus in meteorites, a process
  of oxidation of the original substances may, on the contrarj-, be supposed to
  have taken place, which was either incomplete on account of a deficiency of
  oxygen, or otherwise imperfect by reason of some interruption arising in its
  action. In order to submit the effects of such a process to experiment, un-
  oxidized sUiciuret of iron was heated in a crucible, in contact with calcined
  magnesia, with a very slight access of air. Silica was thus produced, and it
  combined with the calcined magnesia in the form of peridot, while the iron
  was left in a metallic state. In another experiment, an alloy of iron con-
  taining 9 per cent, of nickel, with sulphuret and phosphuret of iron, silica,
  and magnesia, were heated together in a Schloesing's gas-furnace, with the
  same precaution as before of admitting a slight access of air. The resulting
  peridot was olive-coloured, containing iron, and was without a trace of nickel,
  exactly as it is found enclosed in the meteoric irons of Pallas and Atacama.

The remaining metallic iron was more rich in nickel than before, and con-
tained, besides, the sulphuret of iron combined together with the phosphuret,
in the form of the triple phosphuret of iron, nickel, and magnesium (disco-
vered in meteorites by Berzelius), which was separated from the iron by acid

in metallic-looking grains.

  A synthesis of the chief ingredients of aeroHtes being thus found possible

without the use of reducing agents, M. Daubree is finally disposed to adopt
the opinion that aerolites originally underwent a process of scorification,
accompanied by incomplete oxidation, or a species of natural cupeUation* , in
which the substances having most avidity for oxygen were first completely
oxidized, and the less chemically active elements and metals remained partly
in the uncombined state, or alloyed with each other. The complete analogy,
which this view presents to the generally received opinion regarding the
formation, by oxidation, of the earth's crust, recommends its unreserved

adoption as the description of a cosmical process only diifering from that
recognized on the earth by its particular degree of completeness or duration.
The highly oxidized materials, the absence of metallic iron, and the con-
version of phosphurets and sulphurets in the earth's crust into phosphates

and sulphates, may be considered to have resulted from the same process of

scorification, accompanied by a far more advanced oxidation than that con-
cerned in the formation and metamorphoses of meteorites.

    In a later reprint of the same paper f M. Daubree gives the following
Table of the specific gravities of eruptive rocks and basalts, showing the su-

perior gravity of peridot to all of them, closely approaching the ordinary
specific gravity (3-35) of aerolites :

   Continuing his researches on the composition of aerolites +, a new classi-
fication of aerolites, founded on the amount and mode of distribution of
metallic iron in them, was suggested. The process adopted for this classifi-
cation was proposed by M. S. Meunier, and resembles that commonly em-

Aployed in the extraction of metallic gold from its matrix in quartz rocks.

fragment of the aerolite, supported by an iron wire, is heated to redness in
a current of carbonic acid gas, and while still red-hot it is suddenly chilled
by plunging into mercury. The siliceous portions of the aerolite are then
easily crushed out from the interstices of the iron, and the mode of distribu-
tion of the latter is most clearly distinguished : 1°, when the mass of iron is
solid, the meteorite is termed a Sidente ; 2°, when it forms a continuous net-
work in which the siliceous matter is included or interlaced, the meteorite
is a Syssichrite ; 3°, when the iron forms separate grains, or is discontinuous,

as generally occurs in aerolites, the meteorite is a sporado-siderite ; 4°,

Cryptosiderites are those which exhibit a total absence or only very doubtful
traces of metallic iron. In the Syssiderites of Pallas and Atacama the
siliceous parts are discontinuous ; but in that of Rittergriin they form, like
the iron itself, a continuous mass, interwoven with the iron.

   On Spherules in Meteorites (Note by Mr. H. C. Sorby). " The small glo-

bules of iron thrown off in the Bessemer process have a structure more like

recapitulation of known facts and theories, rather than a work of original re-

search, this little volume yet contains a mass of interesting information, and

of observations, not hitherto brought together into one book. The following

passage, briefly abstracted from pp. 172-178 of the work, conveys the ingenious
opinion of the author on the early history of aerolites, fireballs, and shooting-

stars, ascribing to them a community of origin with the earth, as supported

by the then existing results of astronomical, and chemical researches on aero-

lites and falling-stars, made known in the previous pages of the work.
   " The chemical portion of this interesting problem has been completely

solved; aerolites are shown to be of the nature of the earth. And if we combine
for a moment the planetary theory [of aerolites] and the fact that the large

aerolites fall generally during the day, whilst the large bolides (either silent

or detonating) appear usually soon after sunset, and shooting-stars (espe-

cially the November and August swarms) always in the night t, we are

forcibly drawn to the conclusion that our earth circulates round the sun in

or near a continuous cloud of its own dust (matter thrown from it during
the earlier periods of its existence), and that this dust is distributed in such

a manner that its larger fragments circulate inside the earth's orbit (v. A. S.

Herschel, 'Intellectual Observer,' April 1865) and gradually decrease in size

as they extend beyond this orbit ; hence the phenomena of aerolites, bolides,

and shooting-stars  If in future years extended observations enforce

upon us the truth of the assumption that meteoroids are really the dust of the
earth, fragments of the earth's mass thrown from it in early years (when

volcanic action was intense, probably long after the moon was separated from

it), which myriads of fragments have continued ever since to circulate along

or near to the earth's path, then I shall be satisfied to have originated this

theory."

Since this was written, the remarkable and probably more correct theory

of the cometary and extra-planetary origin of meteors, advanced by M.

Schiaparelli, has been favourably received by astronomers and meteorologists.

and Jefferson College, U. S.J
   This treatise is a somewhat more condensed and scientific work than the

last. In the first two chapters the history and character of the ring of the

November meteors are described at length, and the recent theory of M.

Schiaparelli on the August and other meteoric rings is specially noticed. The

third chapter contains a catalogue of stonefalls, in chronological order ; and the

4th-llth chapters, discussions of Tarious questions in the theory of meteors,

--such as : the relative number of meteoric falls during the different parts of

the day, or year ; the coexistence of different forms of meteoric matter in the
same rings ; meteoric dust ; the stabihty of the solar system, and the hypo-

thesis of a resisting medium ; the extent of the atmosphere as indicated by
meteors ; the chemical and mechanical theories of solar heat ; and the ex-
planation of temporary and variable stars by the revolution round them of

meteoric rings. In the 12th chapter, the rings of Saturn are regarded as
examples of such formations, the principal gap or interval between them

being thus especially accounted for. The 13th chapter treats of the zone of

asteroids ; and in the concluding chapter of the work the jSTebular Hypothesis

is represented as giving an intelligible explanation of the origin of meteoric

Astreams *.  condensation of nebulous matter, " it is thus seen, accounts

satisfactorily for the origin of comets, aerolites, fireballs, shooting-stars, and

meteoric rings."

   In summing up the result of his conclusions (pp. 120-122), Dr. Kirkman
cites the recent calculations of Leverrier and SchiapareUi on the remarkable

connexion observed to exist between Tempel's comet (I. 1866) and the

group of the November meteors ; of which group the comet appears to con-

stitute the nucleus. The probable periodic time (about 105 years) of the

August meteoric ring is also noticed, the similarity of its elements to those

of the orbit of the third comet of 1862, and the remarkable circumstance,

first pointed out by SchiapareUi, that a nebulous mass drawn into the solar

system fi'om without wiU be deformed in its approach, so as to pass the sun

in a very narrow stream, and that if it returns in an elliptic orbit it will,

after a certain number of revolutions, be converted into a continuous ring of
material substance. The aerolitic epoch of the 27th-30th of November may,

perhaps, be produced by such a ring connected with Biela's comet, near the

orbit of which the earth annually passes at about that date.

"With regard to aerolites, it is observed that they are more frequent

           (1) by day than by night,
            (2) in the afternoon than in the forenoon,

          (3) when the earth is in aphelion than when it is in perihelion.

The first of these conditions is accounted for by the difiFerence in the num-
ber of observers. The second indicates that the orbital motion of aerolites

is generally direct ; and the third is dependent on the greater length of the
day in the apheHac than in the periheliac portion of the year. The asteroidal
space between Mars and Jupiter is not impossibly a wide meteoric zone in
which the largest aggregations are visible to us as the minor planets. The

zodiacal light may also be regarded as an immense swarm of meteor aste-

roids ; and, finally, the meteoric theory of solar light and heat is included
in the treatise as a consequence of the same form of the nebular hypothesis.

   * At p. 30, speaking of the vadiant-point of tlie 19tb-20th of April meteoric shower,

Dr. KirWood states, on Mr. Greg's authority, that it is about Corona. This mistaken

estimate of its position, from an imperfect view of the phenomenon on the night of the
20th of April, 186.3, was given by Mr. A. S. Herschel in a lecture delivered a few days
later, at the Eoyal Institution, in London. The position of the radiant-point was more
accurately determined in the following year (see these Reports for 18(i4, p. 98), and it was
then found to coincide with the place assigned to it by Herrick, in 1839, " near « Lyrse."

horizon, passing a little to the south of Jupiter under /3 Pegasi, and by r) Ursae
Majoris to the north-west horizon. It slowly travelled northwards till it
reached CapeUa, when it gradually faded awaj. While passing Andromeda,

ON MINERAL VEINS IN CARBONIFEROUS LIMESTONE.  429

   As opportunity offered I had been giving an examination to the Carboni-
ferous-Limestone veins of the North of England, in some of which I also

detected the presence of a freshwater fauna.
    During the past year I have been almost daily ocpupied in an examination

of 134 different samples, derived from the lead-mines of Cumberland and

Yorkshire.

   The process necessary for the discovery of organic remains is often difficult,
and needs much perseverance, a single sample occasionally requiring several

days' examination.

    The samples selected are from the less mineralized portions of the veins,
consisting generally of the " Dowks " or clays. They have therefore to be
dissolved and washed, which, from the intractable nature of the material, is
often a difficult operation ; and the residue is then examined.

   From the difficulty involved in a continued examination of many minute
organisms, the time has not been sufficient to enable me now to give a detailed
account of my investigations, which I propose doing on another occasion

but I proceed to give the general results.
    Out of the 134 samples I have examined during the past year, I have

--found organic remains more or less abundantly in not less than eighty a fact

sufficient to show that, as a general rule, they may be found in almost every

vein, if a careful examination be given to its contents.

   From the investigation of the remains I have obtained from the Cumber-

land and Yorkshire veins, it is difficult at present to arrive at any precise
conclusion (as in the case of the Somersetshire and South-Wales mines) as

to when the veins were formed, vrith the exception perhaps of the Fallow-
field Mine in the Tyneside district : all the samples of " dowk " from this
mine have very much the character of coal-shales ; and fi'om the very interest-

ing fact that I have found specimens of a seed (Flemingites gracilis, Carr.)
which belongs to the Coal-measures in this mine, there is every reason for
fixing the infilling of this vein at the age of the Coal-measures. This mine
also yields Valvata and Bythinia, freshwater univalves, and a bivalve closely

related to Pisidium.

   Amongst the organic remains the chief interest wiU attach to the presence
of Valvata and other freshwater sheUs, often in considerable abundance and in
districts wide asunder, showing most conclusively, as I have alreadj- pointed
out on the Mendips, a connexion between the North-of-England mines and
bodies of fresh water, which must have found their way into the veins from
some neighbouring land area.

   Of vertebrata I have obtained teeth and scales of Petalodus, CtenoptycMus,

SquaJoraia ?, Sauricthys ?, Hyhodm ?, Acrodus ? Brachiopoda are represented

by Zellania, Thecidium, Spirifer, Mhynchonella, TerehratuJa, and Discina.

   Foraminifera are generally very rare, and in many veins not to be traced.
In the Keld-Head mines, however, they are most abundant, especially a

Nummuline-like form. Altogether, I have obtained five or six genera, in-
cluding the above and Nodosaria, Cnstellaria, Dentalina, Rotalina, and also
egg-like bodies like single cells of Nodosaria or Dentalina.

   Entomostraca of several species are very widespread, and are probably the
most constant organisms, if Encrinital stems are excepted, which are very

generally obtained.
430 KEPORT--1868.

Report of a Committee, consisting 0/ General Sir Andrew S. Waugh,
   Sir Arthur Phayre^ General G. Balfour^ General Sir Vincent

   Eyre, Captain Sherard Osborn, Mr. George Campbell, and Dr.
   Thomas Thomson, appointed for the purpose of waiting on the
   Secretary of State for India to represent the desirability of an Ex-
   ploration being made of the district between the Brahmaputra, the
    Upper Irawadi, and the Yang-tse-Kiang, with a view to a route

    being established between the navigable parts of these rivers.

At the Dundee Meeting of the British Association a Committee was appointed

to represent to the Secretary of State for India the great importance of an
exploration of the country between India and China. Little or nothing has
been done for the last thirty years to add to our knowledge of that quite

unknown region, though the attention of Government has many times been

earnestly called to it by geographers both in India and in England.
    The yearly increasing importance of the British Provinces of Assam and

Cachar make it from day to day more essential to their prosperity that a
communication should, if possible, be opened with China. There are, how-
ever, two special reasons why the Committee are desirous of pressing this

 subject at the present time.

     1. Since the establishment of a French colony in Cochin China, there is
 reason to believe that an exploratory expedition has been investigating the
upper course of the Menam. As this course is within Chinese territory,
 there is no reason to fear any collision between the two expeditions ; and it
 would manifestly be to the advantage of both that they should meet.

     2. It has come confidentially to the knowledge of the Committee that an
 English traveller, well qualified, is about to start from Shanghai for the pur-
 pose of exploring the upper course of the Tang-tse-Kiang, and of attempt-
 ing to reach India. Were a similar attempt made from the Indian side at the
 same time, his chances of success would be greatly increased.

    The provinces of China which are contiguous to Eastern Bengal and Bur-

 mah are Se Chuen, which lies on the upper waters of the great river Yang-

 tse-Kiang, and Yunan, a mountainous i)rovince south of Se Chuen, the
 western parts of which are inhabited by barbarous or only partially civilized

 races. The road connecting Yuuan with Ava through Bamo is pretty well
 known ; and the Committee understand that it is now being carefully ex-

 amined from the direction of Ava. This route, however, in the opinion of
 the Committee, is too circuitous to sufiice for the wants of Assam, for which
 province the discovery of a more direct route is most important. There is
 every reason to believe that the discovery of such, though difficult, is far from

 impossible.

    In many countries this exploration might be left to private enterprise ; but
 there are strong reasons why the task should in Eastern India be under-

 taken by Government, which alone has the power of influencing the small
 savage tributary tribes by which Assam is surrounded.

     Assam is traversed in its whole length by the river Brahmaputra, which is
 navigable considerably above Sudiya. The great river Yang-tse-Kiang is be-

 lieved to be navigable as far as Likiang. Now the distance between these two

 places in a direct line is less than 255 geographical miles. True the country
 is known to be very mountainous, and to be traversed by large rivers running
 through deep gorges, separated by high snowy mountain-chains. These moun-
 tains, however, are known to be practicable, as the high road from Lassa, the
             ON EXPLORATION BETWEEN INDIA AND CHINA.                                 431

capital of Tibet, to China crosses them all just under the meridian of 30°, and

enters the water-system of the Yang-tse-Kiang at Eathan. This route is in

Wedaily use throughout the summer, but is closed in winter.                          may gather from

the narrative of Hue that some of the j^Jasses are very elevated, and that the

country is very difficult for many days' journey. There is this further ob-

jection to it, that the direct road from Assam to Eastern Tibet, up the course

of the Dihoug, is closed to Europeans by savage tribes, who have hitherto

resolutely opposed the transit of Europeans through their country. As our

influence over these tribes increases, it may be hoped that it will be possible to

explore this route.

The great eastern branch of the Brahmaputra, the Lohit, runs through the

Mishmi countiy, a rugged region of steep mountains covered with dense

forest. The Mishmis are de jure, if not de facto, tributary to England. The

upper course of this stream is more open and fertUe, and inhabited by a Tibetan

race, tributary to Lassa. From this province, called Dzain, there are easy

passes (closed during winter) N. and E., that to the eastward leading, at a dis-

tance of seven laborious days' journey, to the It. C. Mission Station of Bonga,

believed to be on the Salween, from which unfortunately the missionaries have

recently been expcUed. From Bonga, according to these missionaries, there

is a practicable route to the eastward.

Further south there is a well-kuovsTi route, travelled long ago by "Wilcox,

from Upper Assam to the upper valley of the Irawadi. This route crosses no

range more than 9000 feet high, and can therefore present no serious obstacle

to commerce. It is, further, in the direct Hne of nearest contact between the

Brahmaputra and the Yaug-tse-Xiang. The distance from Sudiya to Mancha,

at which place Wilcox struck the Irawadi, is about 100 miles. The unknown

part is thus reduced to 155 miles. There is no doubt that this country is

mountainous  and partly  snowy                                but snowy passes  are  throughout the Hima-
                                                           ;

layas no obstacle to the abundant transit of goods.

The more southerly routes from Assam, over the Patkaye hills and through

Munnipore into the vaUey of the Irawadi, cross no snowy passes, and are

most valuable for commuuication with Burmah ; but, as abeady said, they

are too circuitous to suffice for the connexion between Assam and China.

The unknown country the exploration of which is considered essential by

the Committee is coloured brown in the sketch maj) exhibited ; a large part of

this area is directly under the control of the Government of India, so that its

exploration by a properly equipped party is only a question of expense. The

Upper Irawadi and the other regions dependent on Ava are also, it is believed,

easily accessible to a British Mission. Whether the obstinate resistance of

the Tibetans to the entrance of Europeans is their own act or that of the do-

minant race can only be known by results. Even if no more can be done, the

importance of the thorough investigation of oiir own and the Burmese pro-

vinces cannot be exaggerated. It is only after accurate mapping of the country,

and exact determination of the height and steepness of the mountain-chains,

that the best route can be chosen. The gain to geographical and natural

science would of itself repay all the cost. There is, further, much reason to

hope that the gain to commercial interests would be great ; aud should this

not be the case, the lu'gency of the demand for this exploration by those in-

terests is a good reason for setting the question at rest one way or another.

--432 REPORT 1868.

 Report of the Rainfall Committee for the year 1867-68^ consisting
     of J. Glaisher^ F.R.S., Prof. Phillips, F.R.S., J. F. Bateman,

    F.R.S., R. W. Mylne, F.R.S., C. Brooke, FR.S., T. Hawksley,

     C.E., and G. J. Symons, Secretary.
 Adopting the same arrangement as in former Reports, we have first to record

 steady progress with the extraction and classification of published and un-
 published records, and in the examination of rain-gauges.

     The records of the inclined- and tipping- funnelled gauges, described in the
 Report for 1866, and erected at Rotherham under the superintendence and
 at the cost of Mr. Chrimes, have been discussed with some care. One of the
 principal results is the determination of the true angle at which rain fell during
 certain months, and the effect thereof upon the indications of the gauges.

     The following Table shows at a glance the principal results :

striking had the velocity during the time of rain been recorded instead of the
total motion in 24 hours.

5. The necessity of all observers keeping the top of their gauges strictly

level is brought out very clearly by these Tables ; they show that in summer
a tilt of even 1° will cause a difference of 0-2 per cent, in the amount col-

lected, and in winter of 2 or 3 per cent. It is not infrequent to find gauges

2° or 3° from level, which would give a total error of 5 per cent, if they

were always inclined  towards the wind                                                                            but  as  the  errors are never inten-
                                                                                                               ;

tional, it is probable they neutralize one another ; but it would be far better

for observers to be careful to keep the orifices level, and so avoid the error

altogether.

  We mentioned last year that Professor Phillips had promised to examine

these records ; this he has not been able to complete, but he hopes to do so

during the coming year.

The gauges constructed for Colonel Ward of Calne, in the year 1863, for

the pm-^jose of determining (1) the ratio of decrease of rainfall with eleva-
tion above the ground, and (2) the relative amount collected by gauges of

different sizes and forms, and observed by him during the years 1863-1867

have, in consequence of his ill health and removal from Calne, been moved

during the past year to the Eectorj- grounds, Stratfield Turgis, Winchfield,

Hants, where they have been placed under the care of the Kev. C. H. Griffith,
an experienced and very accurate observer.

than 10 feet high, and very few more than 6 feet, surrounds the house. The
whole of the grounds are perfectly level, as is also the surrounding land for
nearly half a mile in aU directions. The following ground-plan shows the

positions of the vai-ious instruments. It may be well to explain that in

December, 1867, Mr. Symons transferred to Mr. Griffith a series of fourteen
gauges which had been constructed with a view to testing several questions
as to the best material for the funnels of rain-gauges, the loss from evapo-
ration under various conditions, the influence of the angle of the rim of the

gauge, and some other points. On notice of Colonel "Ward's intended re-

moval being received, the extent to which the objects originally contemplated
had been attained was considered. It was thought that the four years' ob-
servations at Calne, corroborated as they were by two years at Castleton
Moor, and current observations at P^otherham had sufficiently indicated the
law of decrease of rain, out of the tailuence of buildings ; it was therefore
resolved that three only of the elevation gauges should be remounted in
their old form, and that the rest of them should be placed on the roof of the
Rectory and outbuildings, in such positions as to give some indication of the

influence of, and amount of error due to, various positions of roof gauges.
   Professor Phillips, F.R.S., and Mr. Symons have both, independently, been

investigating the relation between height above sea-level and amount of rain-
fall as indicated by both new and old stations in the Cumberland district.
Professor Phillips's paper appeared in the Proceedings of the Ashmolean So-
ON THE RAINFALL IN THE BRITISH ISLES.                             435

ciety, and seems to us of such importance that we have transferred it to the

Appendix to this Report. Professor Phillips found that in the Scawfell group

the maximum fall was at an altitude of 1463 feet; Mr. Symons*, by an

entirely different method, had determined that the ma:^imum was at an alti-
tude of 1000 to 1500 feet ; the two methods, therefore, have led to some-
what similar results.

The examination of rain-gauges has been continued as opportunity offered,

and on exactly the same plan as previously, except that a small instrument

termed an " altameter " has been designed by Mr. Symons for his own use

in detennining the angle of elevation of trees, buildings, &c. above rain-

gauges, and therefrom the suitability of the position in which the gauge may

have been placed. " It consists of a brass tube 6 inches long     rig. 3.

and three-quarters of an inch in diameter ; near the top are

double gimbals (c), by the outermost of which the instrument

is suspended between the fingers, when, of course, the body
assumes a truly vertical position. At the lower end is a
small mirror (d), turning on a horizontal axle, whereof one
end is prolonged at e, and carries a pointer on the graduated

arc (a b). If the mirror is (as represented) at an angle of 45°,

objects level with the mirror will be seen in its middle, by
looking thi'ough the smaU eye -hole at the top ; but if objects
are above its level, the mirror must be turned by the axle
(e) into a more horizontal position ; and when the objects are

seen crossing the centre of the mirror, the index will be found

as many degrees towards a as the objects are above the instru-

ment."

In our last Eeport to this Association, attention was drawn

briefly to the variations in the proportion of the mean an-
nual rainfall which is measured in the different calendar

months ; and a Table was given, from which it appeared that,

at stations south of the Tweed, the principal part of the

rainfall occurs in summer where the total fall is small, and
in winter where it is large. But the data used in preparing that Table ex-
tended over a period of only ten years ; a hope was therefore expressed that
during the ensuing year a full investigation might be made, and some further
light thrown on the subject.

  --This has now to some extent been done though, as in all meteorological

investigations, the further search has discovered fresh difficulties and com-

plications, many of which must stand over for future discussion. The follow-

ing, however, is a brief account of the steps which have been taken, and the

results attained since the last Eeport.

   The mean annual and monthly rainfall for all available stations in each
decennial period since the year 1730 were first calculated and tabulated, the

stations being arranged alphabetically for easy reference ; this involved the

extraction of nearly 40,000 monthly readings. Prom these figures the values

for monthly percentage of the annual fall were calculated f and tabulated in
a similar manner, together with the actual mean annual fall for each station
during each decennial period.

    As the Table given last year seemed to show that the time of the

maximum monthly fall varies with the total amount registered in the j-ear

   * British Eainfall, 1867.

   t By P. G-aster, Esq., F.M.S., who has also drawn up the following abstract of the re-

sults he has obtained.

and since, as a rule, the greatest quantity of rain falls at our western stations,
and the least at the more eastern ones, it seemed probable that the peculi-

arity of a maximum fall in winter might be general in the west and a max-
imum in summer in the east. With a view to the determination of this

question, the whole of the stations were grouped in their respective counties,

and these were arranged in districts. The districts chosen were the follow-

ing :--

         CoTJNTRiES.                                    Districts.

Scotland
Ireland                                 Not divided, returns too few.

   In cases where one county has properly formed part of two districts it has
been divided, and the stations distinguished by being arranged in the portion
to which they belong. Thus Yorkshire is divided into east and west Yorks.

    It is impossible to give here all the Tables which have been prepared, as
they occupy far too large a space; but the following list of stations in Lanca-
shire (1850-59) abundantly proves that the supposed law of westerly maxi-

mum in winter and easterly in summer does not actually exist.

since that date were made use of. The following Tables contain the results
of this grouping for each decennial period. The first column gives the
limiting amounts for the groups ; the second, the name 'of the district ; the
third, the number of stations represented in that district, from which the

those where it is large the minimum is in May. The deficit of two or three
days in February should be aUowed for, and we shall then find the true mi-
nimum is usually in March, especially as that month contains thirty-one daj'S.

   One more feature is to be noticed ; for it is impossible in the limited space
which is here available to do more than point out the principal peculiarities

--in so large a work. It is this : at stations where the annual rainfall is

large, the maximum monthly fall is a more decided maximum, and the mi-
nimum a more decided minimum than at stations where the amount is small

in fact the greater the total yearly fall the greater the monthly range.
   The above statements will be rendered more clear by the following dia-

gram (fig. 4), in which the curves for the 20 to 25-in. and 70 to 75-in.
groups for the period 1850-59 are shown. This particular period is chosen
because the larger number of returns give more satisfactorily the variations

which, however, are clearly discernible in all the periods yet examined.

(N.B. The 70 to 75-in. curve has been chosen in preference to the (ex-
   ceptional) 125 to 130-ui., as it is obtained from more than one station,

   and may be better compared with other returns.)

   The first six months of the year are repeated after December, in order that
the complete curve for aU parts of the year may be seen more readily.

 --Scotland. In considering the registers from the Scotch stations (Table

Ila.), we are obliged to speak with some reserve, as the number of reports

received from that country for the period under discussion is very small.

During 1830-39, the first three groups are represented only in the eastern,

and the last three only in the western districts.

   In those cases alone where the number of reports is insufficient to furnish
reliable mean values, is a summer maximum shown at aU ; the tendency is
to an autumnal excess at stations with small annual falls. The winter

maximum at wet stations is, however, very decided. In the following diagram

(fig. 5) the " 20 to 25-in. " curve for the eastern district, and the " 70
to 75-in." curve for the ivestern (1850-59) are shown. Although the latter is

obtained from but one station, it agrees so well with the other higher groups,

that it may be presumed to represent very approximately the true average.

    The variation in the minimum monthly value (if there is any variation at

 all) cannot be well determined from the Tables.

  --Ireland. The returns from Ireland are still fewer than those from Scot-

land, and the range ia the values of the mean annual falls is very limited.
Still the prevalence of a slight summer maximum and February minimum at

--the station with little rain, but a winter maximum and May minimum at

those with little rain is traceable though with far less distinctness than the
corresponding extremes ia either the Scotch or English tabulations. The
following diagram (fig. 6) gives the " 20 to 25-in." and " 35 to 40-in." curves
for the period 1850-59.

   To recapitulate brielly, we find that in England and Wales the following

rules are generally observed in the distribution of rain during the different
months of the year :

 --* " First. If we take an average of a considerable number of years of the

rainfall at various stations, we find that not only do the mean annual amounts

vary, but the monthly percentages of those amounts also vary considerably.

                                                        * British Eainfall, 1867.
                 ON THE RAINFALL IN THE BRITISH ISLES.             443

  --" Secondly.- That (with some exceptions) the time of year when the max-

imum monthly amount occurs, changes with the variations in the mean annual

rainfall ; stations where little falls having their maximum in summer, but

those where the fall is large having theirs in the wiuter<-months.

  --" TMrcUy.- That, so far as the present investigation has proceeded, these

laws hold good in aU three districts into which we have supposed England and

Wales to be divided.

 --" Fourthly. That at stations where the rainfall is very large, the minimum

monthly fall occurs about two months later in the year, and the maximum

about six months later than at those of small amoiuit ; and that in the former
case, these periods of extremes are more clearly defined than in the latter."

   In Scotland a summer maximum is not generally found, but an autumn

preponderance is noticed at the di-ier stations, and a very decided winter*

maximum at the wet stations. The month of minimum does not appear to

vary much.

In Ireland the returns are not sufficiently numerous to give very reliable

results.

   It will be seen from the foregoing remarks, that not at all the stations are

these rules observable ; were it so, a small number of returns would suffice

to show them as well as a large. But the exceptions are few, and may be

--often arranged in groups- thus giving hope of discovering the causes of the

changes we have been speaking of. This, however, is a jjart of the work

which at present has scarcely been entered on, and it would be premature

to attempt assigning any reasons for the phenomena we are noticing uutU

they have beeu more thoroughly and minutely examined. That there are

more causes than one seems certain.

  An attempt has been made to discover whether the same relative monthly

values are found at the same station in all decennial periods ; but very little

has yet been done in this direction, though it is hoped it wiU be completed in

the forthcoming year. It is likely that averages of a larger number of years

than ten will give more satisfactory results than the present decennial ar-

Arangement ; but this, too, must be left for the future to prove.  correction

wiU be necessary for the height of gauges above ground when the work of

more minute examination commences, as that to some extent affects the

monthly values.

   The whole investigation must be considered as still in its infancy, and some

modification of the views here stated ma^ be requisite as we advance. It

seems, however, scarcely right to withhold what is so apparent, because
we are not acquainted with every particidar we wish for. Eather, should the

publication of what is here offered, with a caution as to its being too freely
depended on, either excite wholesome criticism, or in any way stimulate the
work of collecting and properly examining rainfall records, much good will

have been done to this branch of Meteorology. Meanwhile no pains must be

spared in conducting, if possible, to a successful issue, the present investiga-

tion into the monthly distribution of rain over these Islands.
   Some preliminary steps have been taken towards approximately determin-

ing the correction applicable to such of the returns previously referred to as
have been obtained from gauges at any height above the ground. It is

known to many persons that the deficient amount of rain collected in gauges
elevated above the ground varies with the time of year. Of course if the

deficiency was constant, the monthly falls would bear the same relation to
one another as if the gauge had been placed on the ground ; but this is

not the case ; the deficiency is not uniformly distributed throughout the year,

                                                                2h2

but is far greater in winter than in summer, and therefore the restilt of
attempting to deduce the relative fall in different months from elevated

gauges must fail, unless -we can determine the correction required. This we

have essayed to do by examining the results of the various gauges at different
heights at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, as well as the experimental
sets at Calne, Rotherham, <fec. The results are embodied in the three follow-
ing Tables. The construction and mode of using of these Tables is so obvious
as to require no explanation beyond the headings of the columns and the
examples given. It should, however, be mentioned that the values herein
given are not assumed as perfectly correct, but rather as tj'pes of more de-

tailed ones to be subsequently compiled.

   Example 2. At Bishopwearmouth the gauge is 30 feet ahove the ground.

The monthly percentage of total annual faU. is in January 4-6, and in July
8-9 ; required the probable true percentage at the ground level. From the

above Table -93 may be taken as the factor for January and 1'09 for July;

then 4-6^-93=4-9, and 8-9-^l-09=8-2.

 --Two other matters alone remain for consideration in this Report, (1) the

rainfall of the past two years for 1866-67 in continuation of previous

papers pubhshed by this Association, and (2) the results of the examination

of rain-gauges in situ.

With reference to the first subject, we have thought it expedient to draw

up a Table showing the rainfall of the    ten    years  1850-59                                    also  the  same

values reduced to the mean of fifty years by the application of the correction

suggested in the British Association Report 1862, then the actual fall in each

year since 1859. From thence we have determined the percentage of excess

or deficiency in each year, which we believe to be far the clearest mode of

exhibiting the fluctuations of rainfall.

Evidently the quantity of rain received on the surface of the ground near

Scawfell is at a maximum at about half the height of the mountain, the

quantity diminishing from this level both upwards and downwards. The

diminution is not at the same rate on the two sides of the range, being very

rapid on the west, sensibly slower on the east. Taking                                                                                                                                                Fig. 1.

   The curve may be assumed to be parabolic, in which case -j is constant,

and the vertex of the parabola is found at 1463 feet, and the average of rain
at that elevation is 132-1. The average quantity of rain at two stations on

= --opposite sides of the mountains having the same elevation, 132-1 rD", r

being a coefficient determined from the observations. On the eastern side
of the mountain, r (very u'regular) is found= -0000126, but on the westei'n

side -000055.

   If we now turn our attention to the Skiddaw group of mountains, the

results are very different, the quantities of rain registered there being reduced

to about half, viz. 55 inches on Skiddaw, at 1677 feet elevation ; 57 inches
on Derwent Island, 240 feet; and 59 inches at Keswick, 270 feet. Nor is
the case very different about Helvellyn, where Birkside, 1800 feet, receives
81 inches, and "VVythburn, 574 feet, 90 inches. Similar effects about Kirk-
stone Pass, 1500 feet, 82 inches ; Matterdale, 1400 feet, 80 inches ; and
Pattcrdale, 500 feet, 75 inches. In all these cases, the interior Lake moun-
tains, though of nearly the same height as Scawfell, exercise no such remark-
able effect on the quantity and distribution of rain ; the reason being that
they do not receive the first brunt of the moist south-west wind.

    On the other hand, groups of mountains removed from Scawfell, which

front the south-west, exhibit similar if not equal effects. Thus, to the in-

fluence of the group of mountains about the Old Man may be ascribed the

large deposit of rain about Esthwaite Lake (80), Coniston Water-head (100),
and Langdtde (111) ; and the long range of the Fells, north of Kendal, is
jirobably the cause of the heavy rain in Mardale (108 inches) and West Sled-

dale (113 inches). Another centre of rain- dispersion maybe indicated in

Hougill Fells and Wharnside, on the eastern side of the Lake district ; but
no sufheiciit observations are on record for these districts. The axis of most

rain may bo diawn along the main summit of drainage from Scawfell by

Fairfield toward Hougill Fell ; rudely parallel to it, and turning round it on

--the east and on the west, are cuiwes of equal rain 80, 55, and 45 inches,

the latter moderate quantity being succeeded on the eastward by 40, 30, 25,

and 20 inches, the minimum being on the Yorkshire coast, where the far-
ravelled rain-clouds have lost much of their valuable burden. (See Map,

SYNTHETICAL RESEARCHES ON ORGANIC ACIDS.  475

 Report of Synthetical Researches on Organic Acids. By Alfred R.

     CattoN;, M.A., F.R.S.E., Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge.

 1. At the Dundee Meeting of the British Association in September 1867, I

 vas requested to continue my researches on the action of carbonic acid and
 sodium on alcohol, and a grant "was placed at my disposal for the purpose.

     This Report is presented to the Association in compliance with the law
 which requires that, when a grant of money has been made at one Meeting,
 a Report of the progress of the research shall be presented at the next

Meeting.

   2. One principal object of my labours during the past year has been to

 convert as large a proportion as possible of the sodium used in the reaction

into organic salts, and I am now able to report that, instead of obtaining

from 100 grammes of sodium only 7 grammes of sodium-salts of acids formed
synthetically, I have succeeded in obtaining 175 grammes.

    To give an account of the conchtions necessary to this result, and of the
experiments by which it is established, is the object of this Report.

   My3. previous experiments had shown, that, in order to obtain the

largest quantity of synthetically formed salts, it was necessary,

   (1) That the action of the sodium on the alcohol be modified as much as
possible, and with this object the sodium was added gradually and in small

pieces.

   (2) That the temperature of the alcohol be kept as low as possible, by
surrounding the "WouLfe's bottle containing it with a mixture of ice and

salt.

   The manner in which this last condition iniluenced the reaction was no
doubt by increasing the amount of carbonic acid which the alcohol dis-
solved. It tended also to modify the action of the sodium.

   Now it occurred to me that the most eifectual way to modify the action

of the sodium, was to use sodium-amalgam containing such a small per-
centage of sodium that it might act almost imperceptibly on absolute alcohol. I
therefore determined to use sodium-amalgam containing about 2 per cent,

of sodium.

   4. The apparatus used was very simple. Carbonic acid, from a gasogene,
was washed and dried. The gas was then passed through a refrigerator,
which consisted of a large wooden box Lined inside with zinc, and contain-
ing a long spiral leaden lube. Ice was put into the box, and surrounded
the tube, and thus the gas, on emerging from the refi^igerator, was at 0° C.
The refrigerator served also as a storehouse for the ice, and in it 50 lbs. of
ice could be kept for several days without being aU melted. The gas was
then passed through a series of Woulfe's bottles, surrounded with ice and
salt, contained in a wooden trough lined -ndth zinc, and covered with a
wooden lid.

   5. Absolute alcohol was obtained from Messrs. T. & H. Smith, of Edin-

burgh, of sp. gr. -7957 at 60° F. It was distilled from sodium, and its sp. gr.
was then -7940 at 60° V. Sodium-amalgam was prepared by heating mer-
cury, and then adding sufficient sodium to make an amalgam of about 2 per
cent. The amalgam was subsequently fused to render it of uniform com-
position, the fluid part poured on a slab, and, when cool, placed in bottles
containing dry carbonic acid. The amalgam was uniformly crystaUized in
slender needles, which had not tarnished in the slightest degree when used.

                                                                2e2

476 REPORT--1868.

   6. In order to determine tlie amount of sodium used in the reaction, it is
necessary to know accurately the percentage of the sodium in the amalgam.

Two determinations of this percentage were therefore made.

   I, 10-4695 grms. of the amalgam were left in contact with standard sul-
          phuric acid, and, when gas ceased to be evolved, excess of acid was
            titrated with standard caustic soda.

   It was thus found that
   10-4695 grms. contained -1794 grm. sodium. The amalgam therefore con-

            tained 1-714 per cent, sodium.

   II. 8-015 grm. amalgam were boiled in a flask with water till there was
           no perceptible evolution of gas. The caustic soda produced was

            titrated with standard sulphuric acid.

    It was thus found that
    8-015 grms. contained -1403 grm. sodium. The amalgam therefore con-

          tained 1-750 per cent, sodium. The mean of these determinations

            gives 1-732 as the percentage of sodium in the amalgam.
    7. One hundred cub. centims. absolute alcohol were added to each of
eight carefully dried Woulfe's bottles. Carbonic acid was passed for an hour,
in order thoroughly to saturate the alcohol, and then sodium- amalgam added
to each bottle by means of a glass-stoppered neck. For reasons which will
be subsequently understood, the last four bottles were detached after about
twelve hours, and the reaction went on in them without any more carbonic
acid being passed.
   The gas was passed through the other four bottles for three days, the
temperature of the alcohol, for nearly the whole time, being several degrees
below 0° C.
   8. Before describing the method of examining the product of the reaction,
a few words of explanation are necessary. If sodium is dissolved in abso-
lute alcohol, sodium-alcohol is formed and hydrogen given off. If dry car-
bonic acid be passed into the sodium-alcohol, the sole product is ethylcarbonate

                                                                               Na 1

of sodium, to which has been assigned the formula CO.^ p -rr [0. This

compound is decomposed by acids into alcohol and the sodium-salt of the

acid ; by oxalic acid, for instance, into alcohol and oxalate of sodium.
   'Now if a known weight of sodium be added to absolute alcohol, and

whilst the sodium is dissolving a cm-rent of dry carbonic acid be passed, it

is found that the number of cub. centims. of standard acid required to neutralize

Wthe ethylcarbonate is less than is equivalent to the sodium used. If be the

weight of sodium used, and .v the number of cub. centims. of standard oxalic

acid, containing 63 grms. crystallized oxalic acid in the litre, required to

                                                                .t'X"023 is

the amount of sodium incapable of neutralizing standard acid, and which, in

fact, exists as sodium in salts of acids formed synthetically.

   9. If sodium amalgam and carbonic acid act upon alcohol, in order to
determine the sodium used in the reaction, we must know,

   i. The amount of sodium in the sodium-amalgam. This is determined by
calculation from the weight of amalgam used and the percentage of sodium

it contains.

   ii. The amount of sodium left in the amalgam after stopping the reac-

tion. This is determined by leaving the residue of amalgam in contact with

standard sulphuric acid, and determining excess of acid by standard caustic

soda.

i. minus ii. gives (tu) the sodium used in the reaction ; and if, as before, x
                                                     ;;

be the number of cub. ceutims. standard oxalic acid required to neutralize the

w--ethylcarbonate,  ^X'023 is the sodium converted into salts of organic

acids. It is assumed iu the above that an amalgam can be made of uniform

composition, or nearly so, as, in fact, my experiments have shown.

Experience shows that the operations, as above described, can be carried

out so as to give results of great nicety.
    Oxalic acid is used in these determinations on account of the sparing

solubility of oxalate of sodium in water and alcohol, which enables us to

separate it at once from the sodium-salts formed synthetically.

  We10. now proceed to state the results of the examination of the con-

tents of the several bottles. The products of the reaction in the first four
bottles were added together, the amalgam in each bottle being rapidly

washed with water, so that as little as possible of the sodium it contained

might appear as caustic soda in the washings.

   430-5 cub. centims. oxalic acid were required to render the solution neu-

tral, as determined by very delicate neutral test-paper. Therefore Na as

=ethylcarbonate 9-90 grammes.

   740 cub. centims. standard sulphuric acid were required to neutralize
sodium which remained in amalgam, which was therefore 17'02 grms.

11. The amoimt of sodium originally contained in the amalgam was de-

termined from the weight of mercury left after extracting the sodium from

the amalgam.

  If (Hg + Na) denote the weight of sodium-amalgam used, and (Na) the

sodium contained therein, we have

                    (Hg+Na) : (N"a) : : 100 : 1-732

                    .-. (Eg) : (Na) : : 98-268 : 1-732,

                             --(Hg)x 1-732

                         or (Na)= 98:268~-

(Hg), the weight of mercury, was found to be 1954-84 grms.

        =.-. (^^N^a)^   1954-84x1-732  =3^4,-^4^5    grms.
                              987268

Hence 34-45 grms. sodium were contained in amalgam used. From this,
subtracting 17-02, the sodium left in amalgam, we get 17-43 grms. as the
amount of sodium used in the reaction.

   Of these 17-43 grms. sodium 9-90 were converted into ethylcarbonate.
   Therefore the remaining 7-53 grms. existed as sodium in salts of acids

formed synthetically.

Hence 56-22= percentage of sodium converted into ethylcarbonate, and

43-78=              ,,  ,,             ,, salts of organic acids.

   12. "We now proceed to find the total weight of salts formed synthetically.

   For this purpose advantage is taken of the sparing solubiHty of oxalate
of sodium in alcohol.

 --Three solubility determinations at the ordinary temperature gave the

following results :

1 part oxal. of Na dissolves in 143 pts. by weight of alcohol of 20 per cent.

                        1077  ,,                         ,, 40 ,,

with oxalic acid, was evaporated to drjTiess, and the residue treated with
alcohol of 20 per cent., which dissolves the salts formed synthetically, and
leaves pure oxalate of sodium, as the following analysis shows :

    ·522 grm. of the residue gave -5475 grm. 'Na., SO^, or '1774 Na.
   The salt therefore contained 34-11 per cent. Na.

   Oxalate of Na contains 34-33 per cent. Na.

   The solution in alcohol of 20 per cent, was evaporated to dryness, and
heated till it ceased to lose weight in a weighed crucible, a little absolute
alcohol being added to facilitate the drying of the deliquescent residue.

                           Weight of organic salts =22-32 gnns.

   Now 23 grms. sodium correspond to 112 sodium ethylcarbonate. Hence

the weight of ethylcarbonate corresponding to 9-90 grms. sodium is 48-21
grms.

    Hence as from 17-43 grms. sodium are obtained

       22-32 grms. organic salts, and
       48-21 grms. sodium ethylcarbonate,

from 100 grms. sodium would be obtained

       128-06 grms. organic salts, and
       276-59 grms. sodium ethylcarbonate.

   13. If, now, the organic salts be decomposed by a solution of oxalic acid
in alcohol of GO per cent., containing just sufficient oxalic acid to convert
7-53 grms. sodium into acid oxalate, the sodium is converted into acid oxa-

late, and the acids remain in solution. On distilling the acid solution,

alcohol goes over accompanied by the volatile acids. If water be added to
the retort till the liquid which distils over is very faintly acid, the distillate
contains the whole of the volatile acids, and the fixed acids remain in the

retort.

    The acid distillate required for neutralization 148 cub. centims. standard

caustic soda, which are eipiivalcnt to 3-40 grms. Na ; therefore, 3-40 grm.
Na existed in salts of volatile acids. Now 7-53 was the whole quantity of

sodium in organic salts.
    Hence, of the sodium in organic salts,

45-15 per cent, existed in salts of volatile acids, and

54-85  ,,  ,,                            ,, fixed acids.

   14. The solution of sodium-salts of volatile acids was evaporated to dry-
ness, and di-ied till it ceased to lose weight.

       Weight of residue=10-37 grms.

and as the total weight of organic salts was 22-32 grms.,

acid were required to neutralize this caustic soda, which must therefore be

added to the cub. centims. standard acid required to neutralize sodium left in

the amalgam. For the latter purpose 391-6 cub. centims. were required.

+Therefore 391-6 34, or 425-6 cub. centims. are equivalent to sodium which

remained in amalgam, which was therefore 9-79 grms.

1-631 per cent, sodium.

23. In the mauner before described, the iveightjoi organic salts was found

to be 23-34 grms.

Now 5-7 grms. sodium are equivalent to 27-76 sodium ethylcarbonate.

Therefore, from 13-39 grms. sodium were obtained

                          23-34 grms. organic salts, and

                          27-76 grms. sodium ethylcarbonate.

Hence from 100 grms. sodium would be obtained

   Now, since 23-34 grms. of the organic salts contained 7-69 grms. Na,
19-59 grms. contained 6-476 grms. sodium, of which, as we have found,

1-285 grm. were in salts of volatile acids.

Therefore

SYNTHETICAL RESEARCHES ON ORGANIC ACIDS.  481

   The results of this experiment show that, by keeping a current of carbonic

acid constantly passing through the alcohol, the proportion of the fixed to
the volatile acids is greatly increased, as well as the percentage of sodium
converted into organic salts. But hoiv a constant current of carbonic acid
acts in this way, is a question to which at present I can give merely a con-

jectural answer.
    27. In the first experiment 22-32 grms. organic salts were obtained, and

it was found that 19'87 grms. were soluble in alcohol of 80 per cent., and
therefore only 2-45 grms. insoluble therein. The mean of several determi-
nations showed that a uniform mixture of the salts soluble in 80 per cent,
alcohol required for solution 30 times its weight of alcohol of this per-

centage.

   28. In the last experiment the total weight of organic salts was
23-34 grms., and we found they contained 7'69 grms. Na.

   Hence the mean percentage of sodium in the salts was 32-95. This
result is confirmed by the following analysis :

    The dried sodium salts were mixed in a mortar, so as to be as nearly as

possible of uniform composition,
    1-2714 grm. of the mixture gave 1-2977 grm. Na^ SO^, or -4204 Na.

    The salts therefore contained 33-06 per cent. N^a.
    Numerous other analyses agreed with these results.

   29. Now it is remarkable that the percentage of sodium in the organic

salts is nearly the same as in formiate of sodium, which contains 33-82 per
cent, sodium yet of the organic salts in the last experiment only about one-

                                                         ;

fourth were salts of volatile acids, and therefore not more than one-fourth
could be formiate of sodium.

   Now oxalate of sodium, which contains 34-33 per cent, sodium, is the only

salt the percentage of sodium in which is nearly the same as in formiate of

sodium ; so that, at first sight, it seems difficult to understand how a mix-

ture of sodium salts of fixed and volatile acids can contain 33-06 per cent,

sodium. The following experiment shows how this is possible.

   A30. determination was made of the sodium in a uniform mixture of

that portion of the organic salts which dissolved in 80 per cent, alcohol.
    ·2168 grm. gave -2253 grm. Na^ SO^, or -0729 grm. Na.
    The mean percentage of sodium in the salts was therefore 33-66.
    Hence, by calculation, 1-3932 grm. of the same salts contains -4689 grm.

sodium. 2-562 grms. crystallized oxalic acid, which are just sufficient to
convert '4689 grm. sodium into acid oxalate, were dissolved in alcohol and
added to the solution of the above 1-3932 grm. in alcohol of 80 per oent.
The solution was filtered and the precipitated acid oxalate of sodium washed
with alcohol of 80 per cent. The filtrate reqiured for neutralization 13-3 cub.
centims. standard caustic soda, or -3059 grm. Na, which is less than the sodium

originally contained in the salts by -163 grm. On evaporating the neutralized
solution to dryness, the weight of the residue was found to be 1-2185 grm.,

which is less than the original weight of the salts by -1747 grm., and this
agrees very nearly with -163 grm., the loss in sodium. The loss in weight
of the salts was therefore a loss of sodium.

   Hence we see that when the acids are liberated from the sodium-salts, as
originally produced, they do not, when neutralized with caustic soda, take

up the original quantity of sodium. The acids, therefore, were originally
combined with more than a normal quantity of sodium ; that is, not only
was the basic hydrogen replaced by sodium, but also some of the non-basic

or typical hydrogen.
                                      ;

--482 REPORT 1868.

   31. To illustrate this, let us take the case of malic acid, C, H^ 0^. If
both the basic and typical hydrogeu be replaced by sodium, we get a salt,
C^Hj Na, 0., which contains 34-5 per cent, sodium. If the sodium in this
compound were removed by oxalic acid, and the acid again neutralized, we
should get the normal salt, C^ H^ Na,, 0-, which only contains 25-8'4 per cent.
Na. The compound C^ H3 Na,, 0, loses, it will be observed, one-third of its
sodium when converted into the normal salt, C^ H^ Na^ 0^.

   Again, C, H, Na., 0^, disodium giycollate, contains 38-33 per cent. Na. If

converted into C, H3 Na 0^, it would lose one-half of its sodium, and then

contain only 23-47 j^er cent, sodium.

   As another example, C^H,, Na^O,., trisodiura racemate, contains 31-94 per
cent. Na, but the normal salt, C^ H^ Na, 0,,, only contains 23-71 per cent. Na.

   32. Now we found that the liberated acids required for neutralization

·3059 grm. Na, and the residue on evaporation was 1-2185 grm. Hence the
residue contained 25-1 per cent. Na. This residue is, moreover, nearly in-
soluble in alcohol of 80 per cent. Hence, by liberating the acids from the
sodium-salts, soluble in 80 per cent, alcohol, and again neutralizing, they

are converted into salts insoluble in SO per cent, alcohol, and the percentage
of sodium is reduced from 33-66 to 25-1.

    33. In the above experiment, the original quantity of sodium in the salts

was -4689, and the loss of sodium, as before stated, was -163 grm.

,Af\QQ
-^-- =Now,
            2-88, which is nearly 3.

   The salts thus lose nearly one-third of their sodium. It does not follow
from this, however, that the acids are princijiaUy dibasic and triatomic acids
for I have found the product of the reaction to be a very complex mixture, and
therefore the mean loss of more than one-third of the sodium might result iu
a large number of ways from mixtures of sodium-salts of acids having a greater

atomicity than basicity.

   34. An aqueous solution of the salts soluble in 80 per cent, alcohol ac-

quires, on evaporation, an alkaline reaction, owing to the formation of caustic
soda, and the residue is not entirely soluble in 80 per cent, alcohol. Pro-
bably the whole of the synthetically formed salts are originally soluble in
80 per cent, alcohol, but, as might be expected from their containing more
than a normal quantity of sodium, are partially decomposed by evaporation
into caustic soda and salts insoluble in 80 per cent, alcohol, or into oxalate
of sodium and the same salts by the addition of more oxalic acid than is
sufficient to decompose the ethylcarbonate.

    35. In previous Reports to the Association, I showed that formic acid is
one of the volatile acids. It is not, however, the only one, as the following

results prove.

    Part of the volatile acids distilled over with the alcohol at 200° F. The

distillate required for neutralization 8-85 cub. centims. standard caustic soda or

·2035 grm. Na. The residue, on evaporation, was -61 grm., which therefore
contained 33-36 per cent. Na. This result is confirmed by the following
analysis : -1614 grm. of the residue gave -166 grm. Na., SO^, or -0538 Na.
The residue therefore contained 33-32 per cent. Na, and was therefore nearly
pure formiate, which contains 33-82 per cent, sodium.

    The volatile acids which distilled above 200° F. required, for neutralization,
47-05 cub. centims. caustic soda, or 1-082 Na. The residue, on evaporation,
was 3-466 grms., which therefore contained 31-22 per cent. Na, which is 2-6
per cent, less than in formiate.

  _ Again, the volatile acids from the last four bottles required for neutraliza-

tion 2-4-t grms. Na, and the residue of sodium-salts was found to be
7-74 grms., which therefore contained 31-52 per cent. Na. This is 2-3 per
cent, less than in formiate of sodium.

    These results agi-ee in showing that the volatile acids contain at least one
acid of higher molecular weight than formic acid. I have recognized one
such acid, and have succeeded in separating it from the formic acid!

   36. The most general supposition which can be made with respect to the
theory of the production of the fixed and volatile acids in these researches is,
that they are due to the mutual action of carbonic acid, alcohol, and nascent
hydrogen, evolved by the action of sodium-amalgam on absolute alcohol, as
represented by the expression

   37. The results, however, of an elaborate examination of the fixed acids,

into the details of which it is not my intention to enter here, taken in con-

nexion with the conclusions drawn from the examination of the volatile
acids, have shown that probably the whole of the volatile acids, and a con-

siderable part of the fixed acids, are produced by the direct action of nascent
hydrogen or carbonic acid, as represented by the equation

   38. Before, then, we can determine the compounds (if any) for the produc-

tion of which the presence of alcohol is essential, it is necessary to investi-

gate thoroughly the fixed and volatile acids produced by the action of nascent
hydrogen on carbonic acid when carbonic acid is passed through water con-
taining sodium amalgam.

   The replacement of the oxygen in carbonic acid by hydrogen in so simple
a manner is undoubtedly a step in synthesis which assimilates, for the first

time, our synthetical processes to those which we may suppose to take place

in plants where the most complicated compounds are produced from carbonic
acid and water.

   39. The results of my researches during the past year maybe briefly sum-

marized as follows :

    (1) That if a ciUTent of dry carbonic acid be kept constantly passing
through absolute alcohol which is in contact with sodium-amalgam containing
about 2 per cent, of sodium, for every 100 grms. of sodium used in the re-
action at least 175 grms. of sodium-salts of organic acids are formed syn-
thetically, about 35 grms. of which are the sodium-salts of volatile acids, and

the remammg 140 grms. are the sodium salts of fixed acids.

   (2) That the volatile acids consist of formic acid and at least one other
acid of higher molecular weight.

   (3) That the fixed acids are principally acids having a greater atomicity

than basicity, and they are originally produced as sodium-salts, in which both
the basic and tyjucal hydrogen of the acid are replaced by sodium.

   (4) That probably the whole of the volatile acids, and a considerable part
of the fixed acids, are produced by the direct action of nascent hydrogen on

carbonic acid.

I cannot conclude this Report without thanking Dr. Maclagan, Professor

of Medical Jurisprudence in the University of Edinburgh, for the great kind-
ness and liberahty with which he placed the resources of his laboratory at my
disposal                              but I am
                                   ;            especially indebted to Dr.  Arthur Gamgee for much  valu-

able assistance.

 Report on the best means of providing for a uniformity of Weights

    and Measures, with reference to the Interests of Science. By a
    Committee, consisting of Sir John Bowring^ The Rt. Hon. C. B.
   Adderley, M.P., Mr. Samuel Brown, Mr. W. Ewart, M.P., Dr.
    Farr, Mr. J. Frank Fellows, Prof. Frankland, Prof. Hennessy,
    Mr. James Heywood, Sir Robert Kane, Prof. Leone Levi, Prof.

  --DiRCKs, Mr. J. N. V. Bazalgette, Mr. W. Smith, Mr. W.

   Fairbairn, Mr. John Robinson : Prof. Leone Levi, Secretary.

It is now five years since, at the Meeting of the British Association held
in Newcastle, a Committee was appointed to report on the hest means of

providing for a uniformity of weights and measures with reference to the
interests of science, and since then their instructions have heen erdarged to
the effect that they should diffuse the knowledge of the relation amongst
systems of Moneys, Weights, and Measures. Upon the fu-st point regarding
the uniformity of weights and measui-es, your Committee have already re-
ported that the only mode of attaining such uniformity under jjresent cir-
cumstances is by the universal adoption of the Metric System ; and they are
confirmed in that decision by the very general concurrence of opinion in

favour of this system, the repeated decisions of the International Statistical

Congress, the practical adoption of the Metric System by many civilized

nations, the entire satisfaction it affords wherever it has been introduced,
and, lastly, by the extended and growing public opinion in favour of the same
in this country. Other natural units have been urged for consideration, but
your Committee have decided on the Metre as the best unit, solely from
practical considerations. They have seen the absolute necessity of a change
in the Weights and Measures of the country, from the extreme comphcation
of the tables, from the great diversities which exist throughout the country,
and from the extreme difficulty of teaching the present method, or of retain-

ing it when learnt. They are convinced that we cannot introduce even the

decimal scale in the present system without producing considerable change,

and they have concluded that if a change is to be made it is most desirable
to adopt the Metric System, which is at once simple and complete, and is

certain sooner or later to be in general use throughout the world. It should

--be remembered that the metre is no longer an abstract idea a scientific con-
--ception. It is a definite length the length of a concrete object, deposited at

the Archives of Paris, and exactly copied in the standards within our own
reach. The time is past for finding out the best natural unit, and we must
be satisfied with what we have got ; viz. a unit really universal from its wide
diffusion among modern nations.

   Your Committee are pleased to report that a Bill to estabhsh Metric Weights
and Measux-es has been introduced in the House of Commons by Mr. Ewart,
and has met with a most satisfactory reception from both sides of the House.

--The President of the Board of Trade, Mr. Cave, in voting for the second reading

of the same, said : " There can be no doubt that the progress of opinion in

this and other countries as to an international system of Weights and Mea-
sures as well as of coinage within the last few years has been remarkable.
It may be dated from the Great Exhibition of 1851, and has received enor-

mons impulse from the increased facility of locomotion, and the growth of
telegraphic as well as postal communication between the nations of the world.
The French Metric System has already been adopted as an international
system in several countries of Europe, and by the United States of America.

Its introduction into British India in substitution for the existing complicated

system is now in contemplation. There can be no question as to the advan-

tage to all persons engaged in transactions with foreign countries involving

weights and measures in such an international system ; and considering the

great advantages of the simplicity of its decimal scale, and of the relation of
the measures of length, weight, and capacity to each other, as well as the
adaptation of all these to the coinage, and the fact of its having been already

adopted by several countries as an international system, it must be admitted

that if a new system is to be adopted in this country, it can be none other
than the Metric System as established in France." The whole discussion on
the second reading of the Eill which resulted in its being so read by a
majority of 217 against 65, is calculated to further the object in view, and as
a means of diffusing information on the subject, your Committee have con-
tributed a small amount to the expense of publishing the same in a separate
form for general circulation. Owing to the lateness of the season, and the
enormous amount of work before the House, Mr. Ewart agreed to withdraw

the BiU, and the President of the Board of Trade urged the same course in
order to give time to the Eoyal Commission on the Standards to make their
report. The First Report of that Commission has just been issued, and yoiir
Committee are glad to find that the Commissioners have given to the Metric
System considerable prominence ; but it is quite evident that the object of

the Commission, which is now confined to inquire into the condition of the

Exchequer Standards, must be enlarged before the Commissioners can be ex-
pected to deal with the question of substituting altogether the metric for the
old standards. Your Committee are pleased, however, to find from the second
Eeport of the "Warden of the Standards, that he has laid before the Commis-
sioners the laws, ordinances, and official instructions relating to the Metric
System and its establishment in France, and that he was collecting the same
information as regards other countries. In connexion with the Bill in the
House of Commons, your Committee learn with great regret the retirement
from parliamentary life of Mr. William Ewart, whose labours in the cause
have been as judicious as they were persevering and siiccessful.

   Pubhc opinion having manifested itself so strongly in favour of the Metric
System, your Committee hope that Her Majesty's Government wiU proceed

fui'ther in the direction of introducing it as soon as it is practicable. And

again would they urge that the Government should without delay adopt the
Metric Weights and Measures in the Post-office, in the Dockyards, and in
the Customs.

   With a view to exhibit the relation of the metre to the yard, your Com-
mittee have obtained the Mural Standard described in their previous Reports.

A copy of the same has been forwarded to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.
A copy has been placed in the long room of the Custom House in London and

Liverpool. One has been deposited in Dundee, and other copies have also
been promised for public places in the United Ejngdom. Having regard also
to the efforts made by the United States of America to advance pari passu
with this country in the introduction of the Metric System, your Committee
have taken advantage of the presence in this country of Mr. Barnard, Profes-
sor of Astronomy in Harvard CoUege, for presenting to that College a copy
of the Mural Standard that it may be publicly exhibited. Such Mural Stand-

arcl, -with a small tablet, explaining in few words the i^rinciples of the Metric

System, and the table of aU Metric Weights and Measures, is well calculated

to enlighten the public mind on the subject.

With the prospect that at an early period the use of the Metric System will

be rendered compulsory, your Committee consider it of the highest importance

to diffuse the knowledge of the same in schools and colleges, and among

members of Literary and Mechanic Institutions throughout the country. One
of the first steps taken by your Committee when they were first appointed,

was to offer a small prize for the best school-book on the Metric System,

and also to wait on the President of the Committee of Council on Education

for the purpose of suggesting the introduction of the Metric System into the

examination of teachers in training schools. These two objects have again

been under consideration ; and with a view to encourage the teaching of the

Metric System, your Committee have, by the instrumentality of the Society

for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufacture, and Commerce, offered three

prizes of £5, £3, and £2 to such candidates who at their annual examination

Ashall exhibit the greatest proficiency in the Metric System.  similar

arrangement has also been concluded with the Committee of the British and

Foreign School Society, which is connected with upwards of one thousand

schools throughout England ; and your Committee have with pleasure offered

two prizes of =£5 each, to be awarded to such Students in their Training Col-

leges, who shall show the most perfect acquaintance with the Metric System.

And your Committee would consider it of great advantage to offer the same

encouragement to the schools connected with the National Society, and the

Home and Colonial School Society. The prize for the production of an ele-

mentary school-book conveying the most requisite information in the most

attractive form has again been advertised.

It having come to the knowledge of the Committee that the Eoyal Society

is now sending Dr. Carpenter and Professor Wyville Thompson in Her

Majesty's Steamship ' Lightning,' under Lieutenant May, to dredge in the

North Atlantic, and that a log and a sounding machine had been recently

constructed by Messrs. Walker and Son of Birmingham, to measure in Metres,

Kilometres, and Myriametres, your Committee have presented these two

instruments to Dr. Carpenter as part of the equipment for the voyage ; Dr.

Carpenter agi-eeing to communicate the results in the terms of the Metric

System.

Abroad the Metric System is making constant progress. During this year

it has been adopted in North Germany, and Austria is preparing to follow in

the same course. With reference to the measurement of tonnage, your Com-

mittee have learnt, that the Chancellor of the North German Confederation

having moved the Federal Council that the presiding power should bo autho-

rized to open negotiations with Great Britain, and subsequently with other

maritime powers, including the United States of America, for establishing an

international system of ship measurement on the basis of the English system,

the Federal Council resolved that the proposed system should be based upon

the metrical principle instead of the English tonnage. In Spain the Metric

System of Weights and Measures has been rendered compulsory from the 1st

July, 1868. In the United States of America considerable progress has been

made. A circular letter, signed by great numbers of schoolmasters and other

teachers, advises that all books of arithmetic should contain the system.

--And the last meeting of the International Statistical Congress held at Flo-

rence, unanimously resolved as follows : " The Congress of Florence, in ac-

cordance with the opinion emitted by all the previous Statistical Congresses,
                                                       --

                    UNIFORMITY OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.                                  487

recommend the universal adoption of a uniform system of weights and mea-
sures founded on the Metric Decimal System." The Congress expressed the
wish that the knowledge of the same be diffused as much as possible, and with
a view to that object it recommended the teaching of the system in all primary

schools, the use of publications adapted to the intelligence of the greatest

number, and the adoption of aU the means of instruction proposed in the
report of M. Jacobi adopted by the Conference held in Paris in June 1867.
Some idea of the universality which the Metric System has already attained,

may be found from the fact that already as many as thirteen countries,

including France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, the Roman States, Spain,
Portugal, Greece, Mexico, Chili, Brazil, New Grenada, and other South Ame-

rican Republics, with an aggregate population of upwards of 146,000,000,
have estabHshed one uniform Decimal System founded on the Metre. Seven
more countries, with an aggregate population of 68,000,000, have also
adopted parts of the same ; whilst this country and the United States, having

together 60,000,000, have introduced the same in a permissive manner.

And in India the Government of the Bengal Presidency recommended the

adoption of the Metric System as the best means for introducing simplicity
and unity in the Weights and Measures of that vast Empire.

   The population of and trade with the countries which use the Metric
System of "Weights and Measures, is as follows :

                   TIDAL OBSERVATIONS.                        489

   2. The Congress entrusts to a Central Committee the duty to gather, classify, and pub-
lisli in the most known journals of Europe the data of the production, and immecliate

diffusion over the markets of tlie Old and New World of the precious metals, and of tlu

mintage operations of different States.

   3. The Congress recommends the study and development of the laws under vrhich the
precious metals, whether in coin or bullion, move from place to place.

   4. It is desirable to define according to the dictates of science, and the character of the
different institutions, the paper money which represent or replace the coinagef

    5. It is desirable to have periodical or bimonthly accounts of the variations in the

amount of such, and of the relation which exists between such paper money and the pre-

cious metal.

    7. It is desirable to endeavour to obtain, if possible, statistical data of the cii'culation

mnot included paper money or other instruments of credit.

  A schedule of the required data on such sulsjects was also furnished as follows :

   Production, distribution, and consumption or use of the precious metals.

  --1. Production. Gold and silver: indicate as respects gold if it has been obtained by

extra.'3tion or by wa.shing. Note the place or centre of production. Give the weight and

value of annual production.

 --2. Distribution, Imports, and Exports. Countries wliioh send and receive by sea or

land. Give the quantity and kind imported and exported, whether ingots, coins, objects
of art, or simple industrial product. Prepare a monthly table of imports and exports

with such details.

 --3. Consumption or use. Weight and value of coinage pieces of every kind having

legal course in the State issued by the Mint. Amount of old coin withdrawn. Quantity
of the precious metal consumed in gold and silver work and jewelleries. Quantity and

value absorbed for industrial uses of every kind. Valuation of annual loss.

   As the Report of the Royal Commissioners on International Coinage will
be soon published, your Committee defer pronouncing any opinion on the
subject for the present. The great object for which your Committee has been
formed is steadily advancing, and your Committee entertain the firm convic-
tion that notwithstanding all opposing influences, it wiU. be eventually and
at no great distance, fully and successfully carried out.

                   Report by Sir W. Thomson.

The following Circular, issued to the Committee in December 1867, explains

the plan of procedure proposed and the progress made in the investigations

up to that date :

  WeSiE beg to invite your attention to the following statement, drawn

up by' Sir William Thomson, for the piu-pose of explaining to the members of
the Committee on Tidal Observations, the special objects he had in view in
moving the appointment of that Committee.

  We shall feel obliged by your favouring us at your earliest convenience

with any remarks on this statement which may occur to you, and with any
further suggestions you may wish to lay before the Committee.

                             We are, Sir,

   r&S 1-11 of what follows is, with a few corrections, the statement which
was circulated in December. The foot-notes in brackets [ ] have been added

this day, Aug. 19, 1868.]

1. The chief, it may be almost said the only, practical conclusion deducible

from, or at least hitherto deduced from, the dynamical theory is, that the

heioht of the water at any place may be expressed as the sum of a certain

number of simple harmonic functions* of the time, of which the periods are

known, being the periods of certain, components of the sun's and moon's

motionsf. Any such harmonic term will be called a tidal constituent, or

sometimes, for brevity, a tide. The expression for it in ordinary analytical
+ R = R =RA Anotation is
cos n<  B sin nt ; or      cos  (nt--e)                                 if  cos e, and B  sin e ;
                                                                     ,

where t denotes time measured in any unit from any era, n the correspond-

ing angular velocity (a quantity such that  --9                         is the period of the function),

R Aand e the amphtude and the epoch, and and B coefficients immediately

determined from observation by the proper harmonic analysis (which consists
virtually in the method of least squares applied to deduce the most probable

values of these coefficients from the observations).
   2. The chief tidal constituents in most localities, indeed in aU localities where

the tides are comparatively well known, are those whose periods are twelve
mean lunar hours, and twelve mean solar hours respectively. Those which
probably stand next in importance are the tides whose periods are approxi-

mately twenty-four hoiirs. The former are called the lunar semidiurnal
tide, and solar semidiurnal tide ; the latter, the lunar diurnal tide and the
solar diurnal tide J. There are, besides, the lunar fortnightly tide and the
solar semiannual tide§. The diiumal and the semidiurnal tides have in-
equalities depending on the excentricity of the moon's orbit round the earth,

and of the earth's roimd the sun, and the semidiurnal have inequalities
depending on the varying declinations of the two bodies. Each such in-

equahty of any one of the chief tides may be regarded as a smaller super-

imposed tide of period approximately equal ; producing, with the chief tide,
a compound effect which corresponds precisely to the discord of two simple
harmonic notes in music approximately in unison with one another. These

two of the solar elliptic diurnal tides thus indicated have the same period,

3. Here y denotes the angular velocity of the earth's rotation, and rr, rj, -m

those of the moon's revolution round the earth, of the earth's round the sun,

and of the progression of the moon's perigee. The motion of the first point

of Aries, and of the earth's perihelion, are neglected. It is almost certain

that the slow variatioa of the lunar declinational tides due to the retrogres-

sion of the nodes of the moon's orbit, may be dealt with with sufficient

accuracy according to the equilibrium method ; and the inequalities produced

by the perturbations of the moon's motion are probably insensible. But

each one of the twenty-three tides enumerated above is certainly sensible

on our coasts. And there are besides, as Laplace has shown, very sensible

tides depending on the fourth power of the moon's paraUax*, the inves-

tigation of which must be included in the complete analysis now sug-

gested, although for simplicity they have been left out of the preceding

schedule. The amplitude and the epoch of each tidal constituent for any

part of the sea is to be determined by observation, and cannot be determined

except by observation. But it is to be remarked that the period of one of

the lunar diurnal tides agrees with that of one of the solar diurnal tides,

being twenty-four sidereal hours ; and that the period of one of the semi-

diiu'nal lunar declinational tides agrees with that of one of the semidiurnal

solar declinational tides, being twelve sidereal hours. Also that the angular
-- y--velocities y a-^m and
                                (7-- tzr are so nearly equal, that observations

through several years must be combined to distinguish the two corre-

sponding elliptic dim-nal tides. Thus the whole number of constituents to

be determined by one year's observation is twenty. The forty constants

specifying these twenty constituents are probably each determinable, with

considerable accuracy, from the data afforded in the course of a year by a

good self-registering tide-gauge, or from accm-ate personal observations taken

at equal short intervals of time, hourly for instance. Each lunar decUna-

tional tide varies from a minimum to a maximum, and back to a minimum,

[* The chief efiect of this at any one station is a ter-diurnal lunar tide, or one whose

Aperiod is eiglit lunar hours.  probable indication of this has been obtained from the

Ramsgate tidal diagrams of 1864. See § 22 below.]

                                                                                                                                2l2

every nineteen years or thereabouts (the period of revolution of the Kne of

nodes of the moon's orbit). Observations continued for nineteen years will
give the amount of this variation with considerable accuracy, and from it the

proportion of the effect due to the moon will be distinguished from that due

to the sun. It is probable that thus a somewhat accurate evaluation of the

moon's mass may be arrived at.

4. The methods of reduction hitherto adopted*, after the example set by

Laplace and Lubbock, have consisted chiefly, or altogether, in averaging the

heights and times of high water and low water in certain selected sets of

groups. Laplace commenced in this way, as the only one for which observa-

tions made before his time were available. How strong the tendency is to

pay attention chiefly or exclusively to the times and heights of high and

low water, is indicated by the title printed at the top of the sheets used

by the Admiralty to receive the automatic records of the tide-gauges ; for
instance, " Diagram, showing time of high and low water at Kamsgatc,

traced by the tide-gauge." One of the chief practical objects of tidal investi-

gation is, of course, to predict the time and height of high water ; but this

object is much more easily and accurately attained by the harmonic reduction

of observations not confined to high or low water. The best arrangement of

observations is to make them at equi-distant intervals of time, and to observe

simply the height of the water at the moment of observation irrespectively

of the time of high or low water. This kind of observation will even be less

laborious and less wasteful of time in practice than the system of waiting

for high or low water, and estimating by a troublesome inter-polation the time

of high water, from observations made from ten minutes to ten minutes, for

some time preceding it and following it. The most complde system of obser-

vation is, of course, that of the self-registering tide-gauge which gives the

height of the -water-level above a fixed mark every instant. Bat direct ob-

servation and measurement would probably be more accurate than the records

of the most perfect tide-gauge likely to be realized.

5. One object proposed for the Committee is to estimate the accuracy,

both as to time and as to scale of height, attained by the best self-registering

tide-gauges at present in use, and (taking into account also the relative

costliness of chtferent methods) to come to a resolution as to what method

should be recommended when new sets of observations are set on foot in any

place. In the mean time the following method of observation is recommended

as being more accurate and probably less expensive, than the plan of measure-

ment on a stem attached to a float, often hitherto followed where there is no

Aself-registenng tide-gauge.    metal tube, which need not be more than 2 or

3 inches in diameter, is to be fixed vertically, in hydrostatic communication,

Aby its lower end, with the sea.  metal scale graduated to centimetres (or

to hundredths of a foot, if preferred) is to be let down by the observer in the

middle of the tube mitil it touches the liquid surface; and a fixed mark

attached to the top of the tube then indicates the reading which is to be

taken. Attached to the measuring-scale must be one or more pistons fitting

loosely in the tube and guiding the rod so that it may remain, as nearly as
may be, in the centre of the tube. The observer will know when its lower

end is precisely at the level of the surface of the hquid, by aid of an electric

circuit completed through a single galvanic cell, the coil of a common telegxaph

" detector," the metal measuring-scale, the liqiiid, and the metal tube*. By

this method it wiR be easy to test the position of the water-level truly to the
teuth of an inch. It is not probable that tidal observations hitherto made,
whether with self-registering tide-gauges or by direct observations, have had
this degree of accuracy; and it is quite certain that a proper method of
reduction will take advantage of all the accuracy of the plan now iiroposedt-

   6. An observation made on this jjlan every three hours, from day to day

for a month, would probably suffice to give the data required for nautical

purposes for any harboiu'. It is intended immediately to construct an appa-
ratus of the kind, and give it a trial for a few weeks at some convenient
harbour, and if the plan prove to be successful and convenient, it will come
to be considered whether observations made at every hour of the day and
night might not, all things considered (accuracy, economy, and sufficiency for

all scientific wants), be preferable to a self-registering tide-gauge.

   7. One of the most interesting of the questions that can be proposed in
reference to the tides is, how much is the earth's angular velocity diminished
by them from century to century ? although the direct determination of this
amount, or even a rough estimate of it, can scarcely be hoped for from tidal
observation, as the data for the quadrature required could not be had directly.
But accurate observation of amounts and times of the tide on the shores of
continents and islands of aU seas might, with the assistance of improved
dynamical theory, be fully expected to siipply the requisite data for at least

a rough estimate. In the mean time it may be remarked that one very

important point of the theory, discovered by AiiyJ, affords a ready means
of disentangling some of the complicacy presented by the distribution of the
times of high water in different places, and will form a sure foundation for
the practical estimate of a definite p«r< of the whole amount of retardation,
when the times of spring tides and neap tides are better known for all parts
of the sea than they are at present. To understand this, imagine a tidal
spheroid to be constructed by drawing an infinite number of Unes perpendi-
cular to the actual mean sea-level continued under the solid parts of the earth
which lie above the sea, and equal to the spherical harmonic term or Lajjlace's
function, of the second order, in the development of a discontinuous function
equal to the height of the sea at any point above the mean level where there
is sea, and equal to zero for all parts of the earth's surface occupied by dry
land. This spheroid we shall call for brevity the mean tidal spheroid (lunar

or solar as the case may be, or luni-solar when the heights due to moon and
sun are added). The fact that the lunar semidiurnal tide is, over nearly the

whole surface of the sea, greater than the solar, in a greater ratio than that of

the generating force, renders it almost certain that the longest axes of the mean
luni-tidal and soU-tidal spheroids would each of them lie in the meridian 90°
from the disturbing body (moon or sun) if the motion of the water were un-
opposed by friction ; or, which means the same thing, that there would be on
the average of the whole seas, loiv water when the disturbing body crosses
the meridian, were the hypothesis of no friction fulfilled. But, as Airy has

shown, the tendency of friction is to advance the times of low and high water

   [* Instead of the galvanic detector, a hydraulic method may be fovmd preferable in some
places. The latter consists in using a stiff tube of half inch diameter or so, instead of the
solid metal measuring-bar, and testing whether its lower end is above or below the level
of the water by suction at the upper end.]

    [t The " Clyde Trust " have given permission to try this method at a convenient place
in the harbour of Glasgow. It is probable that it will also be tried in the harbour of

Belfast.]

    X See Airy's ' Tides and Waves,' § 459.
--494 REPORT 1868.

R-lien the depth and shape of the ocean are such as to make the time of low
water on the hypothesis of no friction be that of the disturbing body's transit.
Now, the well-known fact that the spring- tides on the Atlantic coast of
Eui-ope are about a day or a day and a halt' after fuU and change (the times
of greatest force), and that through nearly the whole sea they are probably
more or less behind these times, which Airy long ago maintained* to be a
consequence of friction, would prove that the crowns of the luni-tidal spheroid
are in advance of those of the soli-tidal spheroid ; and therefore that those
of the latter are less advanced by friction than those of the former. It is
easily conceived that a knowledge of the heights of the tides and of the
intervals between the spring tides and the times of greatest force, somewhat
more extensive than we have at present, would aiford data for a rough estimate
of the proper mean amount of the average interval in question, that is, of the
interval between the times of high water of the mean luni-tidal and mean
soli-tidal spheroids. The whole moment of the couple retarding the earth's
rotation, in virtue of the lunar tide, must be something more than that calcu-
lated on the hypothesis that the obliquity of the mean luni-tidal spheroid is

only equal to the hour-angle corresponding to that interval of time.

   We8. know, however, but little at present regarding the actual time

of the spring tides in different parts of the ocean, and it is not even quite
certain, although, as Airy remarks, it is extremely probable, that in the
southern seas they take place at an interval after the full and change,

although it may be at a less interval than on the Atlantic coast of Europe.
There must be observations on record (such as those of Sir Thomas Maclear
at the Cape of Good Hope, which Staff-Commander Bm-dwood showed me in

the Hydi-ograpliical Office of the Admiralty) valuable for determining this very
important element, for ports on all seas where any approach to a knowledge
of the laws of the tides has been made.

    To collect information on this point from aU parts of the world wiU be
one of the most interesting parts of the work of the Committee.

    9. Another very interesting subject for inquiry is the lunar fortnightly, or
solar semiannual, tide, the determination of which wiU form part of the
complete harmonic reduction of proper observations made for a sufficient
time. The amounts of these tides must be very sensible in all places remote
from the zero linef of either northern or southern hemisphere ; unless the
 solid earth yields very sensibly in its figure to the tide generating force+.

Thus it has been calculated that if the earth were perfectly rigid, the sum of
the rise from lowest to highest at Teneriffe, and simultaneous faU from highest
 to lowest at Iceland, in the lunar fortnightly tides, would amount to 4-5
 inches. The preliminaiy trials of plans for harmonic reduction referred to
below, make it almost certain that hourly observations, continued for a
 month at two such stations as these, would determine the amount of the
 fortnightly tide to a fraction of an inch, in ordinarily favourable circum-
 stances as to barometric disturbance, and so woiild give immediate data for
 answering, to some degree of accuracy, the question how much does the solid

 earth really yield to the tide generating force ?

   A A10. year before proposing to Section of the British Association the

 appointment of a Committee to promote tidal investigation, I applied through

 my friend Staff-Commander Moriarty, R.N., for a 3-ear's tidal diagrams of

any trustworthy tide-gauge ; and, through his kind assistance, I accordingly

received from Staff- Commander Burdwood, E.N., those of the Royal Harbour

of Ramsgate for 1SG4. From the beginning of last winter till the present

time I have been engaged in the reduction of these observations, chiefly

assisted by Mr. Ebenezer Maclean, but also by Mr. James Smith and Mr.

William Ross, students of the Natural-Philosojihy Class of Glasgow Uni-

versity, last Session, who volunteered to perform the laborious processes of

measui-ement and calculation required. The heights above a certain point

near the bottom of the scale, chosen to avoid negative quantities, were mea-

sured from the diagrams for noon and midnight 6 p.m. and a.m., 3 p.m. and a.m.,

9 A.M. and p.m. ; but after some preliminary calculations had shown what
valuable results might be expected, the measurement was made for every

mean solar hour of the year, and the numbers written down in a book, with

a page for each day. Certain averagings of these results, arranged in proper

groups, were then made, and somewhat closely approximate determinations

of the amplitude and epoch of the solar semidiurnal and lunar semidiurnal

tides were deduced. I also found very decided indications of an annual rise

and fall, which seemed to exceed the amount of the solar semiannual tide,

and to make the mean level very sensibly higher in autumn than in spring,

an effect probably to be accounted for by an annual period ia the amount of

water received into the sea by drainage and the melting of ice, and from the

direct fall of rain into it. With these indications of what might be expected

from a thorough reduction of tidal observations according to the harmonic

plan, I felt justified in bringing the subject before the British Association

and proposing that the cooperation of a Committee should be iu\-ited, and a

grant of money made to defray expenses which might be found necessary for

carrying on the several parts of the investigation proposed. Acting on the

advice of the Astronomer Royal, I have put the work of continuing the com-

piitations for the Ramsgate observations into the hands of a skilled calculator,

Mr. E. Roberts, recommended to me by Mr. Parley of the Nautical Almanac

Office, for this purpose. With his very able assistance I hope soon to have

the harmonic analysis completed for the year's observations now in his hands;

and I shall lose as little time as possible in communicating the results to the

Committee. I shall keep in view the trial (with which I commenced work

on these observations) to find how much of valuable results can be obtained

from a comparatively small number of observations, for instance, observations

every three hours of the twenty -four, instead of every hour, or every three

hours of the day half of the twenty-four, for the purpose of learning how

to reduce, as far as possible, the labour and inconvenience imposed upon those

to whom may be committed the execution of observations taken in future

according to advice from this Committee.

11. Probably the best personal observations that have ever been made on

the tides are those described by Captain Sir James Clark Ross, R.N., in the

Philosophical Transactions for June 1854, as having been made by the

officers and petty officers of H.M. ships ' Enterprise ' and ' Investigator,'

every hour of the twenty-four, for nine months, commencing November 1st,

A1848, in Port Leopold.  full harmonic reduction of these observations, and

of the simultaneously observed heights of the barometer, must, as early as

possible, be executed by this Committee.

angular velocities small in comparison -with that of the earth's rotation, so
that the diurnal period of each relatively to the earth is something not very

different from the lunar or solar trventy-four hours. Each one of the
approximately semidiurnal tides (§ 2) is produced by one alone of these

fictitious stai's.

    13. One of the fictitious stars is what is commonly called in England the

"mean sun," being that point of the celestial sphere in the plane of the earth's
equator whose hour-angle is equal to mean solar time. For brevity we shall
call it S. Another of them might be the " mean moon " similarly defined
(called M); but, to allow the same Tables (§§ 14, 15) to be used for the
reduction of tidal observations of different years, we shall take it as a point

moving in the plane of the earth's equator, with an augular velocity equal
to the mean angular velocity of the moon, and set for each year so that
its hour-angle is 350°-40 at 0'', January 1. Four others complete the
number of the fictitious stars to be used in this Eeport*; they will be

designated X, L, N, 0.

  K might be the first point of Aries, but, for the same reason, will be taken

as a point in the plane of the earth's equator, A^-ith constant right ascension

for each year, such that its hour-angle is 6°-25 at O**, January 1.

is a fictitious star whose right ascension increases twice as fast as that

of the mean moon, and which is so set for each year that its hour-angle is

334°-54 at O*", January 1. L and N' are fictitious stars whose rates of in-

crease of right ascension are respectively greater than, and less than, that of

the mean moon, by a difference equal to half that of the mean moon rela-

tively to her perigee. Thus, if the motion of the moon's perigee were

neglected, the rate of increase of right ascension of L would be half that of

NN", and the arithmetic mean of that of  and respectively; or, as the

Kright ascension of is constant, the rates of increase of right ascension of

L, M, N, would be cqui-different.

    14. Thus, according to the preceding notation, the rates of increase of

right ascension of K, L, M, N, are respectively

     Tables, with a set of rules for use to be appended, it is anticipated that an

     accurate and extended reduction of tidal observations for any sea and any

     complete year will become a very simple matter. For the present we

     confine ourselves to the statement of what has actually been done for the

     year 1864 and the harbour of Eamsgate.

     16. A datum hue 10 feet below the previously supposed mean level was

     chosen*, and the height of the curves, marked by the self-registering tide-

     guage, was measured from this datum line in feet and decimals of a foot for

     Aeach integral mean solar hour of the year, and entered in the Table.

     period of 369*^ 3", or rather more than a year, was taken as being to the

     nearest hour twelve and a half lunations or twenty-five periods of spring

     and neap tides, and therefore giving a least possible amount of influence of

     the mean lunar and solar semidiurnal tides, each on the sets of averages

     Aused in the calcidation of the other.  period of 358'' 6'' was chosen, for a

     similar reason, for the lunar elliptic semidiurnal tides.

     17. These averages were taken according to the following rule. First

     for the S tides, tsventy-four means of  the  heights  at 0^ 1\ 2^ .  .   .     23'^  of

                                                                                 .

     MS hom-s (or ordinary mean solar time) were taken. Next for the tides

     twenty-four averages were taken of heights grouped similarly according

        * The true mean level for the year 1864 has been found to be 10-192 above this datum
     line, or -192 of a foot higher than was supposed.

M Mwas recorded at a time within half an
                                      hour before or after 0''               time

Mwas taken as if it had been observed at 0''  time, and so for l*", 2'', 3'',
M&c. of the time. The correction on this was applied afterwards, as will

be described later (§ 23). Pour other averagings were performed according
to the same rule for the K, L, N, reckonings respectively ; each averaging

giving a group of twenty-four means.

18. The next step was to find for each of these six sets of averages the

coefficients A,,, A,, B^, A^, B,, &c. of the harmonic formulae,

+A,,-|-AjCos ni BjSin nt
  + A., cos 2nt -f B., sin 2nt

                              + +Ag cos Snt Bg sin 8nt,

n denoting, as in § 1, the rate of increase of the hour-angle for each ease,

K -- Mfor instance y for the tide, y rr for the tide, and so on. The condition

= t=lto be fulfilled is that the values of this formula calculated for t 0,  .. ,

t=23 may agree as nearly as possible, on the whole, with the twenty-four

numbers of the group (the sum of the squares of the differences to be a

minimum*). The tabular forms and rules given by Mr. Aro-hibald Smith,

and published by the Admiralty, to be used for the harmonic reduction of

the deviation of ships' compasses, have been adopted mutatis mutandis, and

have proved very convenient.

    19. If, instead of including only seventeen coefficients, A,,, Aj, B^,

A,, B^, the calculation had been extended to A,j, B,j, A^,^, so as to include

in aU twenty-four coefficients, the calculated values would necessarily have

agreed with the twenty-four numbers given by observation. But there was
no apparent probability that anything more than accidental irregularities and

errors of observation could be represented by higher terms than A^, B^, and
therefore these were the highest included. The following Table exhibits the
results of this process. The columns headed " differences " preserve the

residues, however, and may be referred to should further study of the subject

indicate that useful results are to be derived from them. The greatest of
them is -037 of a foot, and the maxima in each column are only from ^L to

calciilated by the average of several years. There is no tide corresponding

strictly to them.

A3, B3 are, as they ought to be, very good approximations to zero in all

the columns except M. Their values in this column constitute, probably, a

genuine expression of the ter-diurnal lunar tide [not included in the pre-

ceding general schedule (§ 2) but referred to in § 3], investigated by
Laplace as depending on the fourth power of the moon's parallax.

A^, B, express shaUow-water tides* derived from the lunar semidiurnal

tide, according to precisely the same dynamical principle as that by which

Helmholtz has explained the over-tones generated in very loud sounds, even

when the source of the sound is a simple harmonic motion. There ought to

be no sensible tide expressed by A^ and B^ in column L, and the comparative

largeness of these numbers is probably an accident, owing either to errors of

observation or the imperfection of the system of combination adopted, or a

chance concurrence of disturbance due to wind &c.

   A,, B. in almost every column approximate remarkably well to zero ; and
even their greatest values (those of column S) express merely a deviation

of 4L- of a foot (or 0-3 of an inch) on each side of the mean level.
   Ag, B|, may be considered as insensible for every column except M, for

which they express, as they ought to do, an undoubtedly genuine shallow

water tide, being the second harmonic (as it were overtone) of the lunar

semidiurnal tide.

A., B. are very good approximations to zero in all the columns.
MA^, Bj, in column
                    express probably a genuine, though very small,

shallow-water tide, the third harmonic of the lunar semidiurnal tide.

There is a very good approximation to zero in all of the other columns.

   23. It is interesting, with reference to the mode of reduction which
has been adopted, to remark to how nearly zero the comparatively large

values of A^, B. in column 0, and A^, B^ in column L of the first approxima-

tion are reduced by the corrections found in the second approximation,

explained above. Selecting from the preceding Table the coefficients which

are each probably a genuine tide, and applying the proper correction

(Everett, Roy. Soc. Edin. Trans. 1860) to take account of the circumstance

that the mean height for each hour has been virtually taken for the height
at the middle of the hour, we have the following, according to notation of § 2.
--504 REPORT 1868.

   24. The shallow- water tides referred to above depend on the rLse and
fall of the tide, amouuting to some sensible part of the whole depth of the

water, or, which comes to the same, the horizontal velocity of the water

being sensible in comparison with the velocity of propagation of a long wave,

through some considerable portion of the sea which seusiblj- influences the
tides at the point of observation. Helmholtz's explanation of compound

sounds, according to which two sounds, each a simple harmonic, having

--mt, nt for their arguments, give rise, if loud enough, to sounds having for

theu" arguments (^m-\-)i)t, (m n)t, suggest that the compound action of the
solar and lunar semidiurnal tides, must give rise to shallow-water tides
whose arguments are 2(o--- r?)< and 2{2y--r)--a)t. It is intended with the

least possible delay to perform averagings with a view to determine these
tides*. The great influence of the British Channel, and the large extent of

it through which the shallow- water condition specified above is fulfilled,

makes it probable that the new tidal constituents now anticipated will be

found sensible.

   25. The step next undertaken has been to find mean solar daily averages,
and to purify these of lunar-diurnal and semidiurnal influence ; and in a
few days more I hope to determine the lunar fortnightly deelinational and
the solar semiannual tides ; also the annual variation indicated by Mr.

Ebenezer Maclean's calculations (§ 10), and of the 2{a--r]) luni-solar fort-
nightly shaUow-water tide suggested (§ 24) by Helmholtz's theory of com-

pound sounds. This work is now in progress f.
   26. Observations made every quarter horn- during several periods within

four days at a station in the Piji Islands, supplied to me through the kind-

ness of Lieut. Hope, E.N., have been partially reduced, by a rigorous appli-
cation of the method of least squares. This somewhat laborious process has
been undertaken not only for the sake of the results to be obtained, which,
considering the chaotic mass of statements constituting our present informa-

tion regarding tides in the Pacific, we may regard as not without value in
themselves, but also to show how much may be done by applying the
harmonic analysis to a very short series of observations such as may be made

in the course of a few days in any part of the world by surveying officers.
I expect to be able in the present case to obtain somewhat accurate deter-
minations of the mean limar semidiurnal, the mean solar semidinrnal, the
lunar diurnal, and the solar diurnal tides, each of which is probably sensible
in the series of observed heights which have been supplied ; but it has been
necessary to defer this work to allow the full reduction of the Eamsgate
1864 series to be pushed on as far as possible towards completion before the

present Meeting of the British Association.
   27. The work requisite to obtain the results stated above has been, as

may readily be conceived, very heavy ; but a large part of it is available for

other years and other places. It has been almost all performed by Mr. E.
Eoberts, who has devoted himself to it with most satisfactory zeal, abihty,
and perseverance, in intervals of his laborious duties for the Nautical

(or synodic foi-tnightly) tide, and a very notable result has been obtained (see § 28 below);

but as yet I cannot feel much confidence in it, because the period is that of tiie spring to

neap and back to spring tides, and the Eamsgate instrument did not work well through

the longer ranges (the buoy, for instance, sometimes rested on the bottom, and the failing

curve-reo-ister was supplied by guess). The calcidation nccessarUy includes instrumental

errors depending on the gauge not working equally well through long and short ranges.

t Mr. Roberts has since completed it. For results see § 28 below. [Note added

allow him to give his whole time to a continuance of the work during
the ensuing year, with assistant calculators working by aid of printed tables
according to methods which by the experience now gained may be put into

the form of convenient practical rules. Thus, while Mr. Eoberts may work
out proper methods for short or irregular series of observations, others may

be employed to deduce results from tide-gauge diagrams of other British
ports, and from the admirable series of recorded heights (every quarter hour)

for Brest and other French ports which have been shown to me in the

Hydrographic Office in Paris through the kindness of MM. LiouvUle and

Delaunay, and Admiral Paris, and which may be had, it is hoped, on

application by the Committee.

   From tide-observations made at considerable intervals, and reduced in the
manner followed above, some approximation to the secular changes (caused
by the widening or narrowing, the deepening or filling up of rivers) can to
some extent be estimated", and embankments or other protections carried
out at those places where the tide is making encroachments, and a surer

foundation afforded for the reclamation of land.
    There can be no doubt that in aU these operations every advance towards

more perfect knowledge of the tidal movements will be accompanied by an
economy of time and labour which in the aggregate must be very considerable.

   40. It may here be mentioned that there now appears to be a considerable

difference in the spring-range of the tide in the Thames at the London Docks
(amounting to 13 inches in twenty-five years), caused, it is supposed, by the
removal of obstructions, extensive dredging, and the construction of the em-
bankment. In the Admiralty Tide-tables the heights of high water have
been aiigmented by the apportioned amount, but no correction has been appKed
to the times of high water, which are also probably different.

   It is to be hoped that the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty may be
pleased to direct that new determinations of the tides in the Thames and
other places be made with a view of obtaining the reqiiisite foundation for
more extensive tide-tables than those now published, and supplying to the

mariner more accurate and complete knowledge of the tides along our coasts.

 The following Circular, issued to the Committee in I^ovember 1867, explains
 the plan of procedure proposed, and the progress made in the investigation
 up to that time :

  --SiE, No Meeting of the Committee has yet been held ; and as the Members

 are scattered over the country, it appears undesirable to wait for a Meeting.

 I therefore take this opportunity of lapng before you the siiggestions of Sir
 AV. Thomson and myself with regard to the system of observation which
 should be adopted, and shall be glad to receive any suggestions of your own

 in reply.

     The object of investigation is the rate at which, in various locahties, the
 temperature of the earth increases in going downwards, at depths sufficiently
 great to render the annual range of temperature insensible.
                                                                              ;

       ON UNDERGROUND TEMPERATURE.                                            511

The annual range of temperature diminishes in the ratio of 2 or 3 to 1 for

every 10 feet of descent, and becomes reduced to a tenth of a degree Fahr.

--at depths of from 50 to 80 feet in this climate, these results being derived

fi'om observations extending to 25 feet of depth, made at Greenwich and at

three localities in Edinburgh.

  A great boring or excavation, such as a mine, necessarily produces much

disturbance of the normal temperatui'e iu its neighboui-hood, and therefore,

while observations in mines ought not to be neglected, we think the efforts

of the Committee should be chiefly directed towards finding the temperatures

at various depths in smaller borings, such as are usually made preliminary to
mining-operations. As these are often carried to depths of from 300 to 600

feet, they will furnish veiy measurable differences of temperature at different

depths in the same boring. It is suggested that observations should be made

at every 50th foot of depth.

  A method which has been used by Angstrom wiU probably be found most

convenient. It consists in enclosing a thermometer in a large glass bottle of

water, letting it down to the point where the temperatui-e is to bo taken,

leaving it in that position long enough to ensure that its temperature shall

not difier sensibly from that of the soil nearest to it, then drawing it quickly

up and reading off the thermometer before time is allowed for any sensible

variation in its temperature. It would probably be found advisable to use

two pistons or plugs (two bags of sand might answer the purpose), one above

and the other below the bottle, to check currents of air or of water.

   The thermoelectric method might also be followed with great advantage.

Two wires, one of iron and the other of copper, insulated by gutta percha or

some other covering as in submarine cables, and connected at their ends,
might be let down, so as to bring their lower junction to the point where the

temperature is to be taken, their upper junction being immersed in a basin

of water, and the circuit completed through a galvanometer. The tempera-

ture of the water in the basin might then be altered tiU. the galvanometer

gave zero indication. An extremely accurate determination of the tempera-

ture at various depths could in this way be obtained with great ease and
expedition, when the apparatus had once been prepared ; but the method by

water-bottle, though requiring more time for the observations, wiU probably

be in general preferred on account of its simplicity.

Currents of water in a boring will render it unsuitable for our purpose

but water free from currents will but little affect the accuracy of observa-

tion.

   Every Member of the Committee is requested to find out borings, in his
own neighbourhood or elsewhere, that would be suitable for the investigation,

and also to state whether he could undertake to make the observations him-

self, the thermometers or other apparatus required being supplied by the

Committee.

  Sir Wm. Thomson has already ordered from CaseUa two thermometers

suitable for the water-bottle method, and expects to have them almost imme-

diately for trial ; they are spirit thermometers, with Fahrenheit scales, and

are to be accurate to a tenth of a degree.

   The only observations yet taken in answer to the above invitation were
made near Glasgow by Sir "W. Thomson, from whose recent paper on Geo-

logical Time (Trans. Geol. Soc. Glasgow, vol. iii. part 1) the following para-
graph (§ 29) may now be quoted.

   " AH sound naturalists agree that we cannot derive accurate knowledge of

underground temperature from mines. But every bore that is made for the

purpose of testing minerals gives an opportunity of observation. If a bore

is made, and is left for two or three days, it will take the temperature of the

surrounding strata. Let down a thermometer into it, take proper means for

ascertaining its indications, draw it up, and you have the measure of the

temperature at each depth. There are most abundant opportunities for geo-

thermic surveys in this locality, by the numerous bores made with a view

to testing minerals, and which have been left, either for a time or perma-

nently, without being made the centre of a shaft. Through the kindness of

mMr. Campbell, of Blythswood, several bores  the neighbourhood of his

house have been put at the disposal of the Committee of the British Associa-

tion, to which I have referred. In one of these bores very accurate observa-

tions have been made, shomng an increase of temperatm-e downwards, but

which is not exactly the same in all the strata, the difference being no doubt

due to different thermal conductivities of theii- different substances. I need

not specify minutely the numbers ; but I may say, in a general way, that the

average increase is almost exactly J^j of a degree Fahrenheit per foot of

descent; which agrees Avith the estimate generally admitted as a rough

average for the rate of increase of undergroiuid temperature in other lo-

caUties.

    " Another bore has been put at the disposal of the Committee, and the
investigation of it is to be commenced immediately, so that T hope ra the
course of a few days some accurate results will be got. It has been selected

because the mining engineer states in his report that the coal has been very

much burned or charred, showing the effect of heat ; and it becomes an in-

teresting question. Are there any remains of that heat that charred the coal

in ancient times, or has it passed off so long ago that the strata are now not
sensibly warmer on account of it?"

   The following report of these observations has been sent by Sir W. Thomson

to the Secretary of the Committee :
   The operations were commenced in December last, with a spirit thermo-

meter by CaseUa, having a stem 14 in. long, divided to tenths of a degree,
and ranging from 39° to Gl° Fahi\ ; it has a biilb 3| in. long by 1 in. diameter,
is enclosed in an outer tube, nearly filled with spirit, and hermetically
sealed ; a protecting case of strong tin covered the whole ; and to this case a
stout copper wire was attached for lowering it in the bore.

   Before commencing the operations, the thermometer, thus mounted, was

left in a vessel of water until the temperature remained unchanged ; it            I
was then plunged into another vessel whose temperature differed by about

10° Pahr. from the former, and an interval of more than a minute elapsed

before any change of reading could be observed ; it was also ascertained that
it could be raised from a depth of 60 fathoms and a reading taken within
this time. The following observations were then made at Blythswood,
about five miles west of Glasgow, during December and January, in a bore

(No. 1) 60 fathoms deep, and filled with water to a constant depth of about
2 fathoms from the surface ;

In aU the observations taken with this thermometer, it was allowed to

remain a day or two at least at each depth before being raised.

The thermometer was nest removed to a second bore, at a short distance

from the former, which was originally 95 fathoms deep, but had become

fiUed up with sediment 45 fathoms, leaving only 50 fathoms free. Observa-

tions were made from early in March till the middle of April ; the results

from the greatest depths were pretty constant, but towards the surface they

varied from time to time, occasioned in aU probability by a constant flow of

surface-water into the pipe, which found an escape at some unknown depth.

The weather was generally wet, and there was always more or less entering

the pipe, affected by the temperature of the air.

It is considered that the thermometer acted very satisfactorily at the

depths at which it was used ; but it is doubtful if its indications could be

relied on for considerably greater depths, on account of the time taken to

wind it up ; and the speed could not be safely increased, particularly if the

bore has rough projections on its sides. An instance of this occurred in the

middle of April. While raising the thermometer with considerable velocity,

it stuck, and would neither move up nor down ; it had to be left till means

were got to detach it gently from the obstruction ; and when brought to

the surface, the upper part of its strong casing was half torn away, but the

thermometer itself quite safe.

With the view of obviating this difficulty, and of observing more rapidly,

trials were being made at bore No. 1 with a thermo-electric junction of in-

sidated copper and iron wire, let down to various depths, and the other

junction placed in a vessel of water, which was heated or cooled, tiU a gal-

vanometer showed no current, when the temperature was taken. Small

discrepancies existed between the results thus obtained and those previously

got directly with the thermometer ; but there has not been time hitherto to

ascertain their cause. The chief difficulties to be overcome were the want

Wm.of a steady stand for the galvanometer (one of Sir                          Thomson's delicate

mirror galvanometers), and the means of obtaining sufficient darkness to bo

able to read it.

  A third method has been tried, which promises to give satisfactory results.

Two of Phillips's maximum thermometers were furnished by Casella ; but

unfortunately on the second day of trial they met with an accident, and had

to be retiu-ned to London to be repaired, and have only just now been re-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

ceived. They will, it is expected, be tried soon at several bores in the
neiglibourhood of Glasgow, one of which is 174 fathoms deep, and at about
half that depth passes through 18 fathoms of greenstone.

   Several small hardy maximum thermometers, suited for rough work, are

being constructed by CaseUa, and are to be had from him by any of the
Members of Committee, or by parties recommended by them.

   Members of Committee are earnestly requested to cooperate energetically in
the work. The arrangements now made for the supply of suitable thermo-

meters will allow useful results to be easily obtained in great abundance,
from every variety of situation where available bores exist, at small expense,

and without much expenditure of time.

       Changes of the Moon's Surface. By Baron Von Madler.

                          [A Commuaication ordered to be printed in cxtenso.'\

The earliest idea of the heavenly bodies was that they were simply accesso-
ries of the earth, and existing only on her account. The course of astrono-

mical discovery compelled these notions to give place to another view, that
these heavenly bodies were independent spheres ; from this naturally sprang
a desLi'e to learn more of these distant worlds. This desii'e can be accom-

plished in part by means of the sight which the telescope gives of the sur-
face of the heavenly bodies ; and our own sateUite in particular presents
such a "wealth of objects" that the most diligent eflbrts of the observer of
the present day wiU fall far short of the representation of them aU ; and
much, very much, must remain for his successors to accomplish. But though
Riccioli more than 200 years ago attached to his ' Grimaldi's Almanack ' of

the Moon the superscription ' Nee homines vivere, nee plants; crescere pos-

suut,' and all subsequent observers must agree with him, yet there were not

--a few who sought to maintain a contrary opinion. In short, inhabitants of

the moon have been sought for Selenites, as Helvetius first called them.
Gruithuysen hoped to see them when they might happen to be passing in a
great mass through some mountain defile (wood-roads was his own word)
and if they themselves could not be perceived, he was reluctant to abandon
the hope that at least their buildiugs and similar works might be observed.
But it is superfluous to dwell on a subject which rests upon such chimerical
notions. The changes which we meet with in the moon have been brought
about by natui-al power far greater and more marked than all the artificial
works we have been able to execute, and these changes are still working
and since it cannot be doubted that with our present instruments it woitld be
possible to perceive from the moon events such as some volcanic eruptions,
and the raising of a new island out of the depths of the sea, so may we
take a hint to discover, if possible, such events in the moon, and to explain

analogously anything seen or supposed to be seen there. Pirst, let us con-

sider the volcanoes of which Sir W. Herschel speaks. That renowned inquirer

expresses himself with all possible caution ; he plainly states that he makes
use of the word only because there must be some term of designation, and
that he aimed at nothing less than a definite explanation. Notwithstanding

this caution, however, many authors have spoken of burning volcanoes in the
moon as an undoubted fact, and with a reference to Herschel's remarks. Her-
schel was the only one at that time who possessed such resources, and it had

long been usual to receive all his observations without the proof which no
                                ON THE CHANGES OF THE MOON's SITKFACE.                         515

one but himself was able to give. These volcanoes we now know were the

strong shining Eing-mountains, Aristarchus, Copernicus, and Kepler, which

he perceived on the dark part of the moon, and which every one who pos-
sesses a telescope of sufficient power may also see at the approach of every
first quarter of the moon. They always appear the same, with the excep-

tion of the small variations caused by Ubration ; and I have never missed
them even in total ecHpses, finding them even then bright and distinct

enough to convince me by measurement that they were identical with those

well-known Eing-moimtains. This also would not have escaped the notice

of Herschel, if the important and varied undertakings, of which he alone was
capable, had left him time to attend more especially to the moon. Schroter,

of Lilienthal, put forward to occupy the field left free by Herschel. With

telescopes of dimensions little less than Herschel's, he observed zealously and
attentively the surface of the moon, and his " Selenotopographical fragments"

for a long time excited general attention, though they are now almost for-

gotten                          in fact, it cannot  be denied that  he mainly promoted the science by
                             ;

gaining Harding and Bessel to astronomical pursuits, and providing them

with means to dechcate themselves entirely to its service ; for his instru-

ments, which for a long time had crowded up the Gottingen Observatory,

have after a close examination by Gauss been pronounced almost useless, and

the telescopic mirrors which were presented to the Cabinet des Physiques are

all that now remain. The observations were never collected, neither were

his data offered to others for the purpose of being reduced to mean librations
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

and besides, he paid too Kttle attention to the advice of his renowned friend

Gibers                          he would discover variations on the  moon's  surface, without  found-
                          ;

ing on them a moon map, for he expressly declared that he regarded them
Myas useless.
                                endeavours to obtain from his sketches a connected pictui'e

of the moon, or at least of a part of it, were in vain ; and Bessel has shown

the inaccui-acy of his measuring-apparatus by giving in one design of Schroter

42" and in another 89" for one and the same distance. Kunowsky has

proved that all these variations which he pointed out were mere illusions. If

we desire to arrive at unmistakeable conclusions respecting physical changes

on the moon's surface, it is imperatively necessary to bear in mind the

optical variations, which may consist

(1) In displacement by Ubration.

(2) In the diiferent LUumination by the sun.

(3) In the changeable transparency of our atmosphere.

I (1) Mountains situated nearer the centre than the edge of the moon's disk

     in appearance are but little affected by libration ; the nearer the edge the
     more they are affected. In such a position a crater might be easily concealed
     by one of its sides, so that one might suppose it only a mountain ; whilst by
      a libration, which removes it fui-ther from the edge, this concealment does not

     take place, and we get a sight of the crater, e. g. that of Schroter's newly de-

      scribed crater in the Eing-mountain. Hevel is probably so to be explained.

   (2) Mountain-walls throw shadows as long only as the angle of the inch-

nation is greater than the height of the sun above their horizon ; and more-
over in places situated far from the centre of the moon, the shadow of a
dechvity is to our view concealed by the declivity itself ; but the smaller
mountains are only to be recognized by their shadows, and a whitish shadow-

less spot may always be circular and sharply defined without our being able

to distinguish whether here a crater, a mountain, or neither is exhibited.

Most of the moon-mountains demand of us repeated observations if we would

gain a right judgment respecting them.
516 REPORT--1868.

    (3) Also, without either clouds or fog being distinctly observed, the trans-
parency of our atmosphere is verj"- different according to time and place, and

little faint projecting forms may easily become alternately visible or invisible

without adducing any other cause than the changeable diaphanism of our
atmosi)here. This alternation is most conspicuous in the so-called " rUlen "

(furrows), which, with few exceptions, are scarcely visible. I could point out

many places which under the most favoui'able circumstance, of the air, appear

streaked by numerous little rills, while at another time nothiag, or nothing

notable of them, is to be seen. An exception must be made only in the case
of those which are so wide that we can perceive their shadows, as the rills
near Huyghens and Aristarchus. Schmidt at Athens, who published a pam-

phlet exclusively on the rills of the moon's surface, has made the same remark.
Again the green colour of some of the moon's landscapes is scarcely visible ; it
generally appears only when the moon is either quite or nearly full, therefore
all the shadows are wanting. At that time, under favourable circumstances,
the greatest part of the Mare Serenitatis appears of a uniform green colour,
with a defined edge towards its blackish-grey margins. At other times these
edges are observed, which are, however, but a lighter grey separated by a
darker; but it is more difficult to distinguish clearly this green in Mare Crisium

and Mare Humorum from the grey.

    Hitherto telescopes of large dimensions have not been employed, or at least

not continuously, for the moon, for which we can find sufficient reason. If

gigantic instruments are to manifest their full power on these objects, not

only occasionally, but in an unbroken succession of nights, it is a matter of
necessity that they be not placed in Northern or Central Europe, and espe-

cially not in the lower regions of the atmosphere. Also they must admit of

a lighter and speedier manipulation, that it may be possible to direct them

to all parts of the celestial vault. For double stars and nebulous spots, it

may suffice that the tube is movable only in or near the meridian ; but this
is by no means a sufficient condition for the moon, and we have never expected
that Lord llosse's telescope would advance our moon knowledge. It is not

here exclusively the question, in the iirst instance, of the utmost magnifying
power ; but quite different, and more difficult conditions must be realized.

We have learned, through the meritorious labours of Piazzi Smith, the unex-

pectedly great superiority which the Peak of Teneriffe offers to astronomical

observations ; and we can adduce the experiences of others, which unite in

proving that the highest possible stations in a tropical, or at least subtropical

country are to be fijxed upon as the most fit for observations of extreme deli-

cacy.  In Italy, Dominique Cassini had  seen  spots on the disk of  Venus                                     in
                                                                                                           ;

Paris, though employing a more powerful instrument, he failed. I myself in

Dorpat, and Lament in Munich, liave sought in vain for these spots which De                                       I

Vico and Secchi found in Eome, and made use of for the determination of

that planet's rotation. In South America, Humboldt could see stars in the

Great Bear which in Europe he in vain sought, although the constellation has

a much greater altitude. Neither would Lassell have changed his residence

to Malta, had he not been aware of the great difference between the two

climates : where the shadows of the trees can plainly be perceived by Venus's

light, there also more can be attained for the moon than in our northern

climate.

   But in order to observe our satellite uninterruptedly and successfully, it

must be possible to turn our instrument to every part of the heavens. AVe

must be able to observe the first visible sickle in the W. or NW. after the

new moon, and in the same manner the last in the E. A telescope which
ON  THE  CHANGES  OF  THE  MOON  >^                 SURFACE        517
                                  S

does not admit of this easy change of position may serve for other astrono-

mical purposes ; for examinations of the moon's surface it is useless. Per

even the largest refractors means may be devised to effect this ; but the great

reflectors are mostly too unwieldly. Mechanics must contrive in this respect

new means that the observer may be placed in a position to manage the great
instrument in any direction that may be desired without extreme fatigue.

Por, besides that only under these circumstances all the moon's phases canbe
used, it is often necessary to keep an object in view for many successive

hours, in order to catch all its peculiarities. But, lastly, the carrying out

completely the representation of an extensive moon landscape, or even of the
whole visible hemisphere, is so comprehensive a task that it cannot be ex-

pected from a single individual. W. Struve, when he had set i;p the Dorpat
refractor, thus expressedhimself :--"He who would delineate the moon with

this telescope, must relinquish every other astronomical work ; for the details

would be too many." And it must be taken into consideration that the map-

ping forms but a part of the labour here demanded, and that extended calcu-
lations of the most varied kind must be made before and during the mapping;

and thus we arrive at the conclusion that the greatest labour of an indivi-
dual cannot suffice, but many must participate in the work. If, however,
anything is to be gained by such united observation, the globe of the moon

--must be arranged by degrees of latitude, for only in this manner would its

every phase be used by all employed, a long and troublesome method, so

that it might appear to many that the results would not be worth the trou-
ble ; but if we wish to become fully acquainted with the natural proportions
of our satellite, we have no other choice. What has lately been observed in

the crater Linne proves at all events that there real changes have taken place,

and that too under circumstances even visible to us. Since Linne (by my

work commenced thii'ty-eight years since) formed a chief point in the trigo-

nometrical chain, I was enabled to give the proportionately exact infor-

mation, which was desired from me on different sides. The occurrence of

perceptible changes is therefore for the first time proved ; but equally remark-

able is the circumstance that these events are rare ; for in seven years' occu-

pation with the moon's siu-face I never met with such before, neither have

Lokrmann and other careful observers of that time.

Since, then, no doubt can be entertained that in such a case everything

depends on being able to criticise how such an object appeared formerly, so

might a possibly exhaustive representation and description of aU the objects

visible to us on the moon's surface be the fundamental conditions of further

intellectual advance. Photography will be able in many respects to facilitate

the labours of which we have above spoken ; undoubtedly our incipient hopes
went much further ; but Uranology must rejoice in this new resource ; never-
theless photographic representations of the moon cannot arrive at the details

which an experienced eye and a large telescope can obtain; and in this case

everything depends on the most exact representation of these delicate details.

Por the greater ring-mountains, plateaux, and chains of mountains belong to

an epoch of formation very long past, and the present time does not dare to
hope to perceive any changes in its general configuration ; and yet an occur-

rence of which we are able to obtain knowledge is of the utmost importance.
The crater Linne, which has hitherto offered the only authentic example of an

admitted change, shows a diameter of 1-4 geographical mUes, or six English

Wemiles ; and it appears to us only under an angle of 5| seconds.  can

observation of the crater Linne in the heUometer of the Observatory at Bonn.

I found it shaped exactly, and with the same throw of shadow, as I remem-
ber to have seen it in 1831. The event, of whatever nature it may have been,

must have passed away without leaving any trace observable by me. I de-

sire now to recommend to moon-observers a hitherto little considered subject,

--and one formerly very erroneously interpreted the " straits " of light which

only show themselves in high sun illumination ; they make a show on Heve-
lius's map, and even much later, as Montes, Myconius, Eryx, Crates, Hereus,
Sepher, and Seir, while still nothing is certain about them but that they are

by no means elevations. Eidges of only 50 feet high are yet to be recognized
through their shadow near the Hght edges, whilst these straits never show

the smallest shadow, and vanish in the vicixiity of the light edges. Their

effect is that we perceive in the full moon but very little of what is seen in

the quadratures, and especially near the light edges. Most probably it is only
a very great capability of reflection of the ground by the high position of the
sun and referrible to internal causes. They proceed in a radiating manner

from single bright ring-mountains, especially from Tycho, Copernicus, Kepler,

Byrgius, Aristarchus, and Olbers; from some other ring-mountains only

single straits are proceeding on one side, as with Menelaus and Proclus.

By a superficial observation they may easily be coirfounded with the moun-
tain veins, and so much the more as these latter have often their origin at

ring-mountains ; but an attentive observer will easily remark essential dif-

ferences between both appearances. I have endeavoured in my moon map to

represent them ; other observers (with the exception of those early ones who

--have explained them erroneously) have not come to my knowledge I mean

as to whether they have made research respecting changes which may occur

in them. The easiest to observe is the light strait which divides the M. Sere-

nitatis almost equally in halves ; still there is another circumstance which
recommends it to a closer inquiry, viz. because it is visible almost up to the

light edge. I have sometimes still observed traces of the N.W. part of the

strait when that of the S.E. was yet covered in night, since none of the other

straits admitted so long a visibility; I have examined it several times for traces

of shadow, but never perceived the smallest. Lastly, I would point out the

rills of the moon's surface as objects whose visibility probably does not de-

pend only on our atmosphere, but is to be referred to real changes ; thus I have

sought for two long years in vain for the S.W. continuation of the Ariadaeus

--rill (though its existence came to my knowledge from other quarters) till it

came unexpectedly to my view in 1833 certainly a most delicate object. It

will always be advisable to observe on the same evening, not merely a single

rill, but many somewhat similar ones ; for, as the earth's atmosphere must
exercise a like effect upon them all, so would a perceptible variation present

us with a hint for further investigations.

   Wishes and propositions, with the recollections of former years, are all

which I am now able to offer. May they be an inducement to younger and
more vigorous observers to draw new and fructifying facts to the Light of our

science ! and may our satellite, after the monstrous fables which for almost
the space of many thousand years have gained credence respecting it, now

begin, not only by its course, but also by its natural constitution, to permit us

to pierce deeper into the secrets of the fabric of the universe
ON POLYATOMIC CYANIDES.  519

         Report on Polyatomic Cyanides. By Thomas Fairley.

                                                  I. Ctanofoem.

I HAVE spent many months and much material in endeavours to obtain this
body in a pure state by the action of potassium-cyanide on chloroform. By

 heating these substances along with a considerable quantity of alcohol, a very
dark-coloured liquid and mass are obtained, often containing free ammonia.

On filtering the warm liquid and distilling off the alcohol, a small portion of

very dark-coloured residue is left. The alcohol which passes over contains
generally ammonia, hydi'ocyanic acid, and unaltered chloroform ; but the
amount of chloroform so obtained I have always found to be much less than
that originally employed in the experiment. The same results are obtained
whether the materials are heated in wcU-closed soda-water bottles, or in a
flask connected with a reversed Liebig's condenser.

    From the residue I have sought to isolate pure cyanoform. I have
employed aU the methods applied by Dr. Maxwell Simpson and others for
the purification of cyanides, as well as other plans thought of by myself, but
without success. On one occasion the residues from many operations had
been collected and extracted with ether. Some quantity of this ethereal
extract was obtained and carefuUy examined. The result was that it was
found to consist in great measui-e of amyhc alcohol, and other substances

which were, I believe, impurities in the alcohol employed.

   A portion of residue obtained as above having been tested and found free

from alkaline cyanides, was heated with sodium. The product contained
sodium-cyanide, as proved by the formation of prussian blue from it. Boiled
with caustic potash, ammonia is evolved, and the liquid, when neutralized,
precipitates ferric chloride ; whether this precipitate contains any new acid I
did not make many attempts to ascertain.

    The hydrogenation of the crude residue gave as final results, chiefly
ammonium-salts, but I did not make many experiments on a material which
I knew was of uncertain composition.

   Two other methods for obtaining cyanoform I have thought of, and made

preparations for. One is the action of potassium or other cyanides on
bromoform, a small quantity of which I have prepared. The other is to form
the nitrite of dichloracetic acid, and to act on it with cyanide of potassium.

I have made experiments in this direction, but I am not yet able to report

on them.

                                  n. Cyanide of Etsyleke.

   I have prepared this body from chloride of ethylene, by Maxwell Simp-
son's process. Attempts to hydrogenize it gave results which did not agree
with one another, but from which I have obtained chiefly succinic acid and
salts of ammonia. The experiments made with this body showed the impor-
tance of paying particular attention to the strength of acid and proportions of

materials used.

                                          III. Ctanoqen &c.

    I have resumed experiments on the hydrogenation of this body, as it is

the most convenient of these biatomic cyanides. When aqueous solutions

and very dilute acid is used to act on the granulated tin, the products are
oxalic acid, ammonia, and a small quantity of a base which gives a very
deliquescent chloride. In two experiments which gave these results, the acid
--520 REPORT 1868.

·was added at intervals during a fortnight, so tliat altogether it amounted to

about five per cent, of the liquid.
    I have passed cyanogen and hydrogen, both perfectly dry, over platinum-

black heated to 130° C. The tube containing the platinum was not connected
tUJ the hydrogen had been passed for about half an hour through the appa-
ratus and drying tubes, and till the cyanogen was given off freely. The
hydrogen was dried by passing over jfive feet of pumice-stone soaked with
sulphuric acid. The two gases were mixed in a three-necked Woulfe's bottle,
before passing over the platinum. They next passed into an empty bulb

apparatus, and then into dilute acid (HCI). On making the connections,

dense fumes filled that part of the apparatus next the acid. After some time
a small quantity of liquid condensed in the empty bulb apparatus next the
platinum. This was found to be strongly alkaUne, and was neutralized with
hydrochloric acid, and filtered repeatedly from a brown deposit which sepa-
rated on standing. The determination of the platinum in the platinum-salt
gave a result corresponding pretty closely to that which would be given by
the platinum-salts of ethylenediamine or methylaminc. The quantity of
platinum-salt (a little over a decigramme) was, however, too small to give a
sufiicieutly reliable percentage. The platinum-black soon changes, and loses
its power. Water then gives with it a very dark- coloured solution, which I

have not much examined.

   In order to obtain perfectly definite results in the hydrogenation of cyanogen
and other cyanides, I have recently adopted the plan of estimating the amount
of metal dissolved, and of the hydrogen or other gases evolved, from perfectly

known quantities of materials, making each experiment as perfectly quanti-
tative as possible. The experiments which I have made, and those which I
am now carrying on, make me confident of being soon able to clear up the
difficulties which I have worked at so long unsuccessfully.

 --Note on the Solubility of Cyanogen in Sulphuric Acid. Cyanogen dissolves

readily in strong suljihuric acid, and is evolved in great measure iinchanged
on addition of water. The solution of cyanogen in sulphuric acid produces
a beautiful purple colour with cuprous cyanide.

 --Note on the preparation of Olefiant Gas. "Wohler recommended to add

sand to the mixture of sulphuric acid and alcohol to prevent frothing. The
objection to this is that the flasks used are very apt to break, by a part of
the bottom becoming dry, and the liquid aftei'wards running down on it. I
have found that pumice-stone in small pieces prevents frothing equally well,
or better, and since it floats on the liquid, there is much less risk of breakage.

Address by Professor Ty^tball, LL.D., F.R.S., Sfc, President of the Section.

The celebrated Fichte, in his lectures on the " Vocation of the Scholar," insisted

on a culture for the scholar which should not he one-sided, but all-sided. His

intellectual nature was to expand spherically and not in a single direction. In

one direction, however, Fichte required that the scholar should apply himself

directly to nature, become a creator of knowledge, and thus repay by original

labours of his o's\ti the immense debt he owed to the labours of others. It was

these which enabled him to supplement the knowledge derived from his own re-

searches, so as to render his culture rounded and not one-sided.

Fichte's idea is to some extent illustrated by the constitution and the labours

Weof the British Association.                                                               have here a body of men engaged in the pursuit

of Natural Knowledge, but variously engaged. While sympathizing with each of

its departments, and supplementing his culture by knowledge drawn from all of

them, each student amongst us selects one subject for the exercise of his own

--original faculty one line along which he may carry the light of his private intel-

ligence a little way into the darkness by which all knowledge is surrounded.

Thus, the geologist faces the rocks ; the biologist fronts the conditions and pheno-

mena of life ; the astronomer stellar masses and motions ; the mathematician the

properties of  space  and number                                                            the chemist  pursues his atoms, while  the physi-

cal investigator has his own large field in optical, thermal, electrical, acoustical,

and other phenomena. The British Association, then, faces nature on all sides

and pushes knowledge centrifugally outwards, while through circumstance or

natural bent each of its working members takes up a certain line of research in

which he aspii-es to be an original producer, being content in all other directions

to accept instruction from his fellow men. The sum of our labours constitutes

what Fichte might call the sphere of natural knowledge. In the meetings of the

Association it is found necessary to resolve this sphere into its component parts,

which take concrete form uuder the respective letters of our Sections.

This Section (A) is called the Mathematical and Physical Section. Mathematics

and physics have been long accustomed to coalesce, and hence this grouping. For

while mathematics, as a product of the human mind, is self-sustaining and nobly
self-rewarding, while the pure mathematician may never trouble his mind with

considerations regarding the phenomena of the material universe, still the form

of reasoning which he employs, the power which the organization of that reason-

ing confers, the applicability of his abstract conceptions to actual phenomena,

render his science one of the most potent instruments in the solution of natural

problems. Indeed without mathematics, expressed or implied, our knowledge of

physical science would be friable in the extreme.
   Side by side with the mathematical method we have the method of experiment.

Here, from a starting-point furnished by his own researches or those of others, the
investigator proceeds by combining intuition and verification. He ponders the

knowledge he possesses and tries to push it fm-ther, he guesses and checks his
guess, he conjectures and confirms or explodes his conjectiu-e. These guesses and
conjectures are by no means leaps in the dark; for knowledge once gained casts a

faint light beyond its own immediate boundaries. There is no discovery so
limited as not to illuminate something beyond itself. The force of intellectual
penetration into this penumbral region which surromids actual knowledge is not

dependent upon method, but is proportional to the genius of the investigator. There
is, however, no genius so gifted as not to need control and verification. The pro-

foundest minds know best that Nature's ways are not at all times their ways, and that

the brightest flashes in the world of thought are incomplete until they have been
proved to have their counterparts in the world of fact. The vocation of the true
experimentalist is the incessant correction and realization of his insight ; his ex-

periments finally constituting a body, of which his pmified intuitions are, as it

were, the soul.
    Partly through mathematical and partly through experimental research, physi-

cal science has of late years assumed a momentous position in the world. Both

--in a material and in an intellectual point of view it has produced, and it is destined

to produce, immense changes, vast social ameliorations, and vast alterations in the
popular conception of the origin, rule, and governance of things. Miracles are

wrought by science in the physical world, while philosophy is forsaking its ancient

metaphysical channels and pursuing those opened or indicated by scientific re-
search. This must become more and more the case as philosophic writers become

more deeply imbued with the methods of science, better acquainted with the facts

which scientific men have won, and with the great theories which they have ela-

borated.

If you look at the face of a watch, you see the hour- and minute-hands, and

Whypossibly also a second-hand, moving over the graduated dial.  do these hands

move ? and why are their relative motions such as they are obsei"ved to be ? These

questions cannot be answered without opening the watch, mastering its various

Whenparts, and ascertaining their relationship to each other.  this is done, we

find that tlie observed motion of the hands follows of necessity from the inner me-

chanism of the watch when acted upon by the force invested in the spring.
   This motion of the hands may be called a phenomenon of art, but the case is

similar with the phenomena of natm'e. These also have their inner mechanism,
and their store of force to set that mechanism going. The ultimate problem of
physical science is to reveal this mechanism, to discern this store, and to show that

from the combined action of both the phenomena of which they constitute the

basis must of necessity flow.

   I thought that an attempt to give you even a brief and sketchy illustration of the
manner in which scientific thinkers regard this problem would not be uninteresting

to you on the present occasion ; more especially as it vsdll give me occasion to say a

word or two on the tendencies and limits of modern science, to point out the region
which men of science claim as their own, and where it is mere waste of time to op-
pose their advance, and also to define, if possible, the bourn between this and that

other region to which the questionings and yearnings of the scientific intellect are

directed in vain.

   But here yom* tolerance will be needed. It was the American Emerson, I think,
who said that it is hardly possible to state any truth strongly without apparent in-

line to some other truth. Under the circumstances, the proper course appears to
be to state both truths sti'ongly, and allow each its fair share in the formation of
the resultant conviction. For truth is often of a dual character, taking the form of
a magnet with two poles ; and many of the difierences which agitate the thinking
part of mankind are to be traced to the exclusiveness with which different parties
aifirm one half of the duality in forgetfiilness of the other half But this waiting

for the statement of the two sides of a question implies patience. It implies a reso-

lution to suppress indignation if the statement of the one half should clash -with our

convictions, and not to siiffer ourselves to be undul}' elated if the half-statement

should chime in with our views. It implies a determination to wait calmly for the

statement of the whole, before we pronounce judgment either iu the'form of ac-

quiescence or dissent.

This premised, let us enter upon oiu* task. There have been writers who afRi-med

that the pj^ramids of Egj^pt were the productions of nature ; and in his early youth

Alexander von Humboldt wrote an essay with the express object of refuting this

Wenotion.      now regard the pyramids as the work of men's hands, aided probably

Weby machinery of which no record remains.    picture to oui'selves the swarming

"workers toiling at those vast erections, lifting the inert stones, and, guided by the

Tolition, the skill, and possibly at times by the whip of the architect, placing the

stones in their proper positions. The blocks in this case were moved by a power

external to themselves, and the final form of the pyramid expressed the thought of

its human builder.

   Let us pass from this illustration of building power to another of a different kind.

When a solution of common salt is slowly evaporated, the water which holds the

salt in solution disappears, but the salt itself remains behind. At a certain stage of

concentration the salt  can no longer retain  the liquid form                                                                                                                                                                                          its particles, or mole-
                                                                                                                                  ;

cules, as they are called, begin to deposit themselves as minute solids, so minute,

indeed, as to defy all microscopic power. As evaporation continues solidification

goes on, and we finally obtaiu, through the clustering together of innumerable

molecules, a finite mass of salt of a definite form. What is this form ? It some-

Wetimes seems a mimicry of the architecture of Egypt.                                                                                                                                                                                                  have little pyramids

built by the salt, terrace above ten-ace from base to apex, forming thus a series of

steps resembling those up which the Egyptian traveller is di'agged by his giddes.

The human mind is as little disposed to look at these pyramidal salt-crystals with-

out further question, as to look at the pyramids of Egyjit without inqidi'ing whence

they came. How, then, are those salt-pyramids built up ?

Guided by analogy, you may suppose that, swarming among the constituent

molecules of the salt, there is an invisible population, guided and coerced by some

invisible master, and placing the atomic blocks in their positions. This, however,

is not the scientific idea, nor do I think your good sense wiU accept it as a likely

one. The scientific idea is that the molecules act upon each other without the in-

tervention of slave labour ; that they attract each other and repel each other at cer-

tain definite points, and in certain definite du-ections                                                                                                                                                                                               and that the  pyramidal form
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

is the result of this play of attraction and repulsion. While, then, the blocks of

Egypt were laid down by a power external to themselves, these molecular blocks of

salt are self-posited, being fixed in theii- places by the forces with which they act

upon each other.

   I take common salt as an illusti'ation because it is so familiar to us all ; but al-
most any other substance would answer my purpose equally well. In fact, through-

--out inorganic natru-e, we have this formative power, as Eichte would call it this

structural energy ready to come into play, and build the ultimate particles of

matter into definite shapes. It is present everywhere. The ice of our winters and

of our polar regions is its haudywork, and so equally are the quartz, felspar, and

mica of om- rocks. Our chalk-beds are for the most part composed of minute shells,

which are also the product of structural energy but behind the shell, as a whole,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

lies the result of another and more subtle formative act. These shells are bviilt up

of little crystals of calc-spar, and to form these the structural force had to deal with

the intangible molecules of carbonate of lime. This tendency on the part of

matter to organize itself, to grow into shape, to assume definite foims in obe-

dience to the definite action of force, is, as I have said, all-per-^ading. It is in

the gi'ound on which you tread, in the water you drink, in the air you breathe.

Incipient life, in fact, manifests itself throughout the whole of what we call inor-

ganic nature.

   The forms of minerals resulting from this play offerees are various, and exhibit

diflerent degrees of complexity. Men of science avail themselves of all possible

means of exploring this molecular architecture. For this purpose they employ in

turn as agents of exploration, light, heat, magnetism, electricitv, and sound.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1*

APolarized light is especially useful aud powerfid here.                                        beam of such light, -when

sent in among the molecules of a crystal, is acted on hy them, and from this action

we infer with more or less of clearness the manner in which the molecules are

arrano-ed. The difference, for example, between the inner structure of a plate ot

rock-salt and a plate of crystallized sugar or sugar-candy is thus strikingly revealed.

These differences may be made to display themselves in phenomena of colour of

great splendour, the play of molecular force being so regulated as to remove certain
of the coloured constituents of white light, and to leave others with increased in-

tensity behind.

  And now let us pass from what we are accustomed to regard as a dead mineral
to a living grain of corn. When it is examined by polarized light, chromatic phe-
nomena similar to those noticed in crystals are observed. Aud why ? Because the

architecture of the grain resembles in some degree the architecture of the crystal.
In the corn the molecules are also set in detinite positions, from which they act
upon the light. But what has built together the molecules of the corn ? I have
already said regarding crystalline architecture that you may, if you please, con-

sider the atoms and molecules to be placed in position by a power external to
themselves. The same hypothesis is open to you now. But if in the case of
crystals you have rejected this notion of an external architect, I think you are bound
to reject it now, and to conclude that the molecules of the corn are self-posited by
the forces with which they act upon each other. It would be poor philosophy to

invoke an external agent in the one case and to reject it in the other.

Instead of cutting our grain of corn into thin slices and subjecting it to the action

of polarized light, let us place it in the earth and subject it to a certain degree of

warmth. In other words, let the molecules, both of the corn and of the surrounding

earth, be kept in a state  of agitation                                                         for warmth, as most of you  know, is, ia the

motion. And as the common motion of heat with which the grain and the sub-

stances surrounding it were first endowed, enabled the gi-ain and these substances

to coalesce, so the specific motion of the sun's rays now enables the green bud to

feed upon the carbonic acid and the aqueous vapour of the air, appropriating those

constituents of both for which the blade has an elective attraction, and permitting

the other constituent to resume its place in the air. Thus forces are active at the

forces here at play act in a cycle which is completed by the production of grains

similar to that with which the process began.

  Now there is nothing in this process which necessarily eludes the power of mind
as we know it. An intellect the same in kind as our own would, if only suffi-
ciently expanded, be able to follow the whole process from beginning to end. No

entirely new intellectual faculty would be needed for this pui-pose. The duly ex-

panded mind would see in the process and its consummation an instance of the play

of molecular force. It would see every molecule placed in its position by the spe-

cific attractions and repulsions exerted between it and other molecules. Nay, given

the grain and its environment, an intellect the same in kind as our own, but suffi-

ciently expanded, might trace out <t j)rwri every step of the process, and by the

application of mechanical principles would be able to demonstrate that the cycle

of actions must end, as it is seen to end, in the reproduction of forms like that with

Awhich the operation began.       similar necessity rules here to that which rules the

planets in their cii'cuits roxmd the sun.

agreed it should be stated. But I must go still further, and affirm that in the eye

of science the animal hocly is just as much the product of molecular force as the stalk

and ear of corn, or as the crystal or salt of sugar. Many of its parts are obviously
mechanical. Take the human heart, for example, with its exquisite system of

valves, or take the eye or the hand. Animal heat, moreover, is the same in kind

as the heat of a fire, being produced by the same chemical process. Animal mo-

tion, too, is as directly derived from the food of the animal, as the motion of

Trevethyck's walking-engine from the fuel in its furnace. As regards matter, the
animal body creates nothing ; as regards force, it creates nothing. Which of you

by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature ? All that has been said regard-

ing the plant maybe restated vdth regard to the animal. Every particle that

enters into the coniposition of a muscle, a nerve, or a bone, has been placed in its

position by molecular force. And unless the e.vistence of law in these matters be

denied, and the element of caprice introduced, we must conclude that, given the

relation of any molecule of the body to its environment, its position in the body

might be predicted. Our difficulty 'is not with the qualitij of the problem, but with

its com2}lexifi/ ; and this difficulty might be met by the simple expansion of the

faculties which man now possesses. Given this expansion, and given the necessary

molecular data, and the chick might be deduced as rigorously and as logically from

the e^^ as the existence of Neptune was deduced from the disturbances of Uranus,

or as conical refraction was deduced from the undulatory theory of light.

  You see I am not mincing matters, but a\owing nakedly what many scientific

thinkers more or less distinctly believe. The formation of a crystal, a plant, or an

animal, is in their eyes a purely mechanical problem, which differs from the pro-

blems of ordinary mechanics in" the smallness of the masses and the complexity of

the processes involved. Here you have one half of our dual truth ; let us now glance

at the other half. Associated ^vith this wonderful mechanism of the animal body

we have phenomena no less certain than those of physics, but between which and
Athe mechanism we discern no necessary connexion.
                                                                                                                                                            man, for example, can say

I Ifeel, thinh, I love ; but how does conseiotmiess infuse itself into the problem ?
The human brain is said to be the organ of thought and feeling ; when we are hm-t

the brain feels it, when we ponder it is the brain that thinks, when oui- passions or

affections are excited it is through the instrumentality of the brain. Let us

endeavour to be a little more precise here. I hardly imagine that any profound

scientific thinker, who has reflected upon the subject, exists who would not

admit the extreme probability of the hypothesis, that for every fact of conscious-

ness, whether in the domain of sense, of thought, or of emotion, a certain definite

molecular condition is set up in the brain ; that this relation of physics to con-

sciousness is invariable, so that, given the state of the brain, the corresponding

thought or feeling                                                                    might be  inferred                                       or  given the thought or feeling, the                                     con-e-
                                                                                                                                            ;

sponding state of the brain might be inferred. But how inferred ? It is at bottom

not a case of logical inference at all, but of empirical association. You may

reply that many of the                                                                inferences of  science are                                   of this  character                                               the  inference,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

for example, that an electric current of a given direction will deflect a magnetic

needle in a definite way ; but the cases differ in this, that the passage from the
current to the needle, if not demonsti-able, is thinkable, and that we entertain

no doubt as to the final mechanical solution of the problem ; but the passage from

the physics of the brain to the corresponding facts of consciousness is unthinkable.

Granted that a definite thought, and a definite moleculai- action in the brain occiir

simultaneously                                                                        we do not possess the intellectual organ, nor apparently any rudi-

the one phenomenon to the other. They appear together, but we do not know

·why. Were our minds and senses so expanded, strengthened, and illuminated as
to enable us to see and feel the very molecules of the brain ; were we capable of

following all their motions, all their groupings, all their electric discharges, if such

there be; and were we intimately acquainted with the corresponding states of

thought and feeling, we should be as far as ever from the solution of the problem,

How" are these physical processes connected with the facts of consciousness ? "

The chasm between the two classes of phenomena would still remain intellectually

impassable. Let the consciousness of love, for example, be associated with a right-

handed spiral motion of the molecules of the brain, and the consciousness of hate

Wewith a left-handed spiral motion.                                                                                                            should then know when we love that the

motion is in one direction, and when we hate that the motion is in the other ; but

the " WHY ? " would stiU remain imanswered.

In affirming that the growth of the body is mechanical, and that thought, as

exercised by lis, lias its correlative in the physics of tlie brain, I think the position

of the " Materialist " is stated as far as that position is a tenable one. I think the
materialist -will be able finally to maintain this position against all attacks; but I

do not think, as the human mind is at present constituted, that he can pass bej^ond

it. I do not think he is entitled to say that his molecular groupings and his
molecular motions explain evei-ything. In reality they explain nothing. The iit-
most he can affirm is the association of two classes of phenomena, of whose real
bond of union he is in absolute ignorance. The problem of the connexion of body
and soul is as insoluble in its modei-u form as it was in the prescientific ages.

Phosphorus is known to enter into the composition of the human brain, and a
courageous writer has exclaimed, in his trenchant German, " Ohne Phosphor koin
Gedanke." That may or may not be the case ; but even if we knew it to be the
case, the knowledge would not lighten our darkness. On both sides of the zone
here assigned to the materialist he is equally helpless. If you ask him whence is
this "matter" of which we have been discoursing, who or what divided it into
molecules, who or what impressed upon them this necessity of running into
organic forms, he has no answer. Science also is mute in reply to these questions.
But if the materialist is confounded and science rendered dimib, who else is en-

titled to answer ? To whom has the secret been revealed ? Let us lower our
heads and acknowledge our ignorance one and all. Perhaps the mystery may

resolve itself into knowledge at some futm'e day. The process of things upon this
earth has been one of amelioration. It is a long way fi-om the Iguanodon and his

contemporaries, to the President and Members of the British Association. And
whether we regard the improvement from the scientific or from the theological

point of view, as the result of progTessive development, or as the residt of suc-

--cessive exhibitions of creative energy, neither view entitles us to assume that

man's present faculties end the series, that the process of amelioration stops at him.

A time may therefore come when this ultra-scientific region by which we are

now enfolded may ofler itself to terresti-ial, if not to human investigation. Two-

thirds of the rays emitted by the sun fail to arouse in the eye the sense of vision.
The rays exist, but the visual organ requisite for their translation into light does

not exist. And so from this region of darkness and mystery which surrovmds us,
rays may now be darting which require but the development of the proper intel-

lectual organs to translate them into knowledge as far surpassing ours as ours does
that of the wallowing reptiles which once held possession of this planet. Mean-
while the mystery is not without its uses. It certainly may be made a power in
the liuman soul ; but it is a power which has feeling, not knowledge, for its base.
It may be, and will be, and we hope is turned to accoimt, both in steadying and
strengthening the intellect, and in rescuing man from that littleness to which,
in the struggle for existence, or for precedence in the world, he is continually

prone.

On the Necessity for State Intervention to secure the Progress of Physical Science.
   By Lieut.-Col. A. Strange, F.B.S., Government Insi^ector of Scientific In-

    strumenfs, India Department.

   The aiithor pointed out that physical science, like literatm-e and the fine arts,
requires to be fniif/ht, to be extended, and to be exhibited ; that the necessity for
teaching science in schools and universities is now generally admitted ; that the

results of science are veiy fully exhibited in all civilized communities ; but that
the pro\-ision for extending the boundaries of scientific knowledge in England is
inadequate and unsystematic. After enumerating some of the institutions, national
and corporate, in which certain branches of science are cultivated, the author re-

marked that these are too limited in their objects, their scope, and their number to

collect the data, and to push on with the necessary promptitude the investigations

of which we stand in need. The paper lu'ges that the period is gone by when
science generally can be cultivated with simple and primitive means ; and that

the required researches of the present day need for their successful prosecution
buildings expressly constructed for the pm-pose, extensive and costl}^ appliances,
and the continuous employment of the highest skill. It is evident that these re-
--

quirements cannot be met by private enterprise and munificence, or even by corpo-
rate bodies supported by private contributions. These postulates being admitted,

it follows of necessity that the resources of the State alone can adequately supply

the existing want ; and that unless these are so employed the progress^ of scientific
knowledge and discoveiy must become slower and slower.

   Without entering into premature details, the paper proposes that there should
be established a sj'stem of national institutions for the sole purpose of advan-
cing science by practical research, quite apart from teachitig it; that such insti-
tutions, provided with extensive appliances and skilled operators, should be pre-
sided over by a governing body constituted with reference solely to the scientific
eminence of its members, or, which would be better, by a single chief, directly
responsible to a Minister of State, as now proposed for the British Museum. That
this body or chief should direct the labours of the Executive into such fields as they

may deem most worthy of being explored ; and that they should also have the

power of sanctioning experiments and investigations proposed by any person un-

connected with them, thus rendering the institution as much as possible accessible

to the scientific public, and to persons whose objects, manufactm-ing or other, re-

quire for their promotion physical data which they may possess neither the skill

nor the appliances to obtain. Publication of results should also be duly provided

for. The paper observes that such institutions would form a consultative body to
which the State woidd resort for that advice and assistance which is now sought
to be obtained by the very costly and not always very satisfactory expedient of
special commissions. The advantages which the nation derives fi-om the results
of science, cultivated even as it is at present, desultorily and inefficiently, woidd
be enormously multiplied by the inti-oduction of the principle of continuitj' in re-
search, and by the employment of the highest skill and the most perfect appliances.
Systematic investigation conducted in the comprehensive manner proposed must
prove directly remunerative, whether applied to strictly State pm-poses, or whether
utilized in the public works, the manufactures, and the general necessities of the

nation.

 --The objections that may be m-ged against the present proposal are then touched

on. The chief of these are : First, that such State institutions would tend to chill
private entei-prise. The reply is, that in certain departments of science the State
has long been compelled to intei-vene. National observatories, surveys, and museums

are instanced. These rather tend to stimulate than to resti-ain the private cultiva-
tion of science. But it is assumed, as the very foundation of the present paper,
that private scientific entei-prise, great as it is in England, does not satisfy the

present demands for physical data and laws ; and therefore, if State intervention

may be expected to satisfy those demands, the risk of discouraging the present
insufiicient agency must be incurred. And it is maintained that the tendency of

progressive civilization must be to supersede individual eflPort. Secondly, that such
a system as that proposed would bring with it abuses and jobbery. Let this be

admitted with regard to science in common with every human organization. Every

profession and every branch of the public service suffers from the inevitable evil.

But in spite of obvious corruption and favouritism, we still keep up an army, a
navy, and a parliament. The greatest care must be taken to exclude abuses ; and
those that wiU undoubtedly gain admission must be considered as part of the

price paid for the advantages obtained. There are no gi-ounds for imputing to
science any special capacity for corruption. Thirdly, that the amount of work to

be done may not prove sufficient for the continuous employment of very extensive
establishments. The paper, however, assumes the contrary ; its limits do not

admit of the discussion of this objection, which would be submitted for the opinions

of the men most eminent in physical research. After a brief recapitulation, the

paper concludes thus :

    " Every visitor to this Congress of Science receives a printed paper, in which he

is told that

       " 'The objects of the British Association are to give a stronger impulse and
   more systematic direction to scientific inquiry,' and ' to remove any disadvan-
   tages of a public kind which impede its progi'ess.'
--"8 REPORT 1868.

    " These words define, as precisely as if they had been written for the express
purpose, the aims of the present proposal. It is for this powerful and enlightened
Body to consider whether such an investigation of the subject shall be instituted

as may serve to direct and impel public opinion in a channel which the educated
classes of Englishmen seem now disposed to enter--insisting on the value and the

comparatively backward condition of physical research, and indicating the means
best fitted to place at man's disposal, systematically and promptly, the intellectual
glories and the material riches which a boimteous Providence has created for

his use."

Resume of Experim.ents on Rigidity. By Professor J. D. Everett, D.C.L.

   After pointing out the relations which connect Young's modulus of elasticity,

simple rigidity, resistance to cubic compression, and the ratio of lateral contrac-
tion to longitudinal extension, in isotropic substances, which relations are such that
if any two of these coeflicients are given the other two can be inferred, the author
proceeded to describe the method by which he had determined experimentally the
values of the two first-mentioned coeflicients, and had hence derived the values of
the other two. The method consisted in applying a given couple to bend and
twist alternately one and the same portion of a cylindrical rod. The especial object
of investigation was the coefficient called " Poisson's ratio," that is to say, the ratio

which the lateral contraction of a rod bears to its longitudinal extension when it is
forcibly lengthened within the limits of elasticity, which ratio was erroneously sup-
posed by Poisson to have the constant value \ for all substances.

    In order to determine the value of this coefficient for any particular isotropic
substance, it was only necessaiy to compare the amounts of bending and twisting
produced in a given portion of a cylindrical rod by couples of equal moment.

Let T denote the amount Fof twisting, the amount of bending, and o- Poisson's
= --Tratio, then o- - 1.

   The object of this communication was to demonstrate the possibility of any

figure without loss of material, and of equal area to the given number of contained

counterparts.

   As tests for instrumental measurements and as discipline for the hand of the

artist, the series suggested exact and interesting exercises in practical geometry,
and might be used in the economy of adjusting materials. The examples (above

to squares and other figm-es with the same identical number of countei-parts, each
figiu'e having some special distinction. The whole series coidd be cut out in paper,
and a given figure made into another figure, thus constituting by ocular demon-
stration an additional means of testing great geometrical truths as a pleasing ex-
perimental exercise.

On the CJiances of Success or Faihire of Candidates for three-cornered or
           four-cornered Constituencies. By 11. B. Hatward, M.A.

   This paper discussed some of the consequences involved in the system of voting

now in force for constituencies returning three or four representatives, by which

no voter can vote for more than two candidates in the one case or for more than

three in the other.

mthe minority of voters bring forward two, and that, of the majority M, .r vote

A Mfor B and C^ y for C and A, and s for Band ; then, supposing that each of the

voters gives both his votes,

A Balso a compound event, e. g. the success of and failure of and C, may be

<denoted by Kbc, and the con-esponding conditions are y-\-z>m, £+.r wj,
z+y < m.

  The different possible events are then ABC, wBC, 6CA, cAB, A6e, Bcw,

Cab, and the question discussed was the determination of the relative numbers of

Mthe cases favourable to these different events for different relative values of and

m, or the relative numbers of positive integi-al solutions (including 0) of the above

equation subject to the different conditions corresponding to the difierent events.

It was sliown that this discussion was much facilitated by a simple geometrical

Arepresentation.  number of points uniformly distributed over an equilateral tri-
Mangle being taken to represent the total number of possible distributions of the

votes or the total number of solutions of the equation (1.), each point corre-

sponding to one solution determinable from its position in the triangle, the numbers

of points within the different areas into which the triangle is divided by lines pro-

perly drawn parallel to the sides, represent the cases favourable to the different

possible events. Thus the relative numbers of these cases are rendered evident

and easily calculated.

the seven spaces correspond to the seven possible events marked within them.
The relative numbers of cases favourable to the different events will be readily

seen to be 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 7, 7, if the number of voters be large, so that an area may
be taken as proportional to the number of points within it.

    If each individual distribution of the votes, or, in other words, each solution of

lities of the different events ; but this is far from being the case, the weight of each

readily be seen that conclusions of a general natiu'e, not without interest and im-

portance, may notwithstanding be obtained in any given case.

presentation of the different cases by the portions into which a tetrahedron is
divided by planes parallel to its four faces.

It was shown that certain series for sin atn . u, assumed to be convergent for cer-
tain values of (u) when sufficiently small, are true when (u) has any value. The
proof depended on an application of the proposition known as Abel's Theorem.

   From the first involute "of a circle we may derive a family of parallel curves

forming the second involutes of the circle ; from each of these again families, the
totality of which will form the third involutes, and so on continually.

   The author had been led by circumstances to study the arco-radial or semi-
intrinsic equation of these curves, and had arrived at certain conclusions concerning
its form which subsequent im^estigations have verified: it turns out that the ge-
neral equation between the arc s and radius vector r of the general involute of the
nth degree will be found by taking F, any rational integer function of x of the nth

=degi'ee, and eliminating x between the equations r- F--h(--\,

                                                                                 s=fdxF+^

It follows, as the author had sm-mised, that the general arco-radial equation for

the involute of the wth order when n exceeds unity, is of the degi-ee («-l-l) in r"^

and 2h in s. Of course, in the case of n equal to unity, the degrees sink to 1 in r^

and 1 in s. The second involute formed by unwi-apping from the cusp of the first
may be termed the natural second invohite, but is not the most simple of the

family                                 this, which is at the normal distance of half the radius externally from the
                                    ;

one last named, is of the third degi-ee in r and the second in s. It may be derived

from the ciu-ve which a fixed point in a wall at half the length of the radius of a
wheel from the gi-ound marks in the wheel as it rolls along the face of the wall
by doubling the vectorial angles and taking the square out of the radii vectores.
From the arco-radial it is easy to pass to the general polar equation to the ?i-aiy

luvolute                                         the  equation  between ^,  the  perpendicular  from  the  centre  and q the

so that this equation will be of the («-- l)th order in q, and the Mth order in p.

the theory of these cu'cular involutes, which it is proposed to term Cyclodes.

On the extent of evidence which lue possess elucidatory of " change " on the
                   Moons Surface. By W. K. Birt, F.B.A.S.

   The questions of change on, or fixity of the moon's surface must bo decided, as

Webb (Celestial Objects for Common Telescopes, second edition, p. 68) remarks, by

observation and not assertion. It is therefore important to gather up the fragments

of our knowledge bearing on the evidence which we possess on these questions
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and we may remark, in the first place, that our 7-eal knowledge of the fixity of the

moon's surface does not at present depend upon " evidence," using this term to

designate the results of observation and not the deductions of theory ; nor can we

possess any adequate evidence of this kind, as is manifest from the very circum-

stance that up to the present moment our records of the physical aspect of the

--moon's surface are not only exceedingly scanty in comparison with the countless

thousands of objects of every variety of description which are revealed to us by

--even small instruments, let alone the increasing visibility of smaller objects due to

larger apertures but it is now becoming acknowledged that such records and the
delineations accompanjdng them are not sufficiently precise and exact to enable us
to refer to them as reliable witnesses in esfahlishing "fixity ;" indeed it is difficult
to conceive how the unalterable state of the moon's surface can be detennined by

" observation." If, as has been asserted, all changes on the moon's surface have

ceased myriads of ages ago, we are certainly destitute of the records of " observa-

tion " of the real state of that surface at so remote a period. In fact our absolute
knowledge of" fixity " can only date from the construction of the first lunar map,
since which there are no traces of any grand convulsion. The establishment of
" fixity " can only have reference to those objects which have been more particu-

larly observed during the intervening period ; and, as shown by Webb (Intellectual

Obseiwer, vol. xii. pp. 435. 436), if really established by a long course of ob-

servation at any one point, it would be no argument for its universal prevalence,

since a state of quiescence might be attained at very different epochs in diSerent

regions.

  Such being the case as regards " fixity," let us now inquire as to what evidence we

possess on the subject of " change." The earliest attempts to perpetuate a Iniow-

ledge of the moon's surface consisted in delineating the disk in the form of maps,

accompanied in two instances with " catalogues " of the most striking and promi-

nent  objects                                    but,  as might be expected,  such  maps  are  greatly destitute  of  " de-

tail," especially of such a character as is necessary to pronounce on " change."

Towards the close of the last centuiy Schroter, seeing the importance of perpetuat-

ing a knowledge of detail, bequeathed to us the result of his labours in this direction

in the form of his ' Selenotopogi'aphische Fragmente,' taking iip portions of the

moon rather than attempting a dehneation of the whole in detail. His successors,
Lohrmann, Beer and Miidler, and Schmidt, have followed in his steps, and pro-
duced works aboimding much more in detail than any of the predecessors of
Schroter ; Lohrmann's sections and map, with the two maps of Madler, are well
known. The larger portion of Lohrmann's Sections, as well as the results ot
iSchmidt's labours, are still unpublished. Webb's index map of the moon in his

* Celestial Objects', with two catalogues of the principal craters, &c., together form

an excellent guide to obsei-vers who are commencing the study of " detail."

   It is by means of the study of " detail " that a definitive answer must be given
to either of the questions mentioned at the commencement of this paper. The

details of the moon's surface are very various ; mountain-chains, towering peaks,
isolated hills, deep valleys, extensive plains scored with comparatively low ridges,

crater-openings, in some localities crowded together hy thousands, in others oc-

cm-ring singly, and situated far apart from each other, rings (apparently the highest

parts of crater walls) the interiors of which convey the idea of having been partially

tilled with an injected material, minute craters are not unfrequent on their sur-

faces ; bright spots, often of a dazzling whiteness, marking the tops of mountains
and the crests of mountain-chains, as well as others of less brilliancy and greater

indistinctness of outline ;  dark spots surrounded in some cases by bright rims in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

others the difference between the dark spots and the comparatively lighter surface

is rendered distinctly visible by a sharp outline inclosing the dark surface. All

these varieties must be carefully studied before a conclusion can be drawn as to the

unalterable stability or mutation of such objects.

 --The means whicli we possess for the study of lunar objects may be considered as

twofold, the examination of delineations and topographical notices on the one

hand, and personal observation of tlie objects themselves on the other, of com-se

including a comparison of one with the other. For example, we may find on the

moon a spot darker than any object in the immediate locality surrounded by a rim
brio-hter than the exterior surface, and we record its appearance. It is now desirable

to place in juxtaposition all the records we possess of it as under.

   Beer and Miidler, in ' Der Mond,' p. 304, thus describe two craters on the

3Iare Ktibiutn. I am indebted to W. I. Lynn, Esq., of the Eoyal Observatory,

Greenwich, for the translation.

   " The boundary of the 3Iare Knbhan does not run alongside of Alpetragius, but

passes by it under several deep curvatures from three to five miles [Geniian] to the

Beastward. In the Mare itself is situated the bright radiating crater (9° light)

at --14° 65' lat. and --7° 27' long., and near this the far larger and deeper one a,

which, however, is found with difficulty at the full moon. It is about 4^°, and the

interior 3° bright (Insula Lesbos H)."

on this point, we have it in our power not only to increase our own observations, but

also to solicit the aid of others, that in the re-observation of an object the want of

confirmatory evidence may not exist to occasion a doubt as to the certainty of
what is recorded. Webb says very truly (Celestial Objects, second edition, p. 68),
we are scarcely as yet possessed of the means of detecting small changes. The

evidence capable of being brought to bear on the questien of change is consequently

very limited in extent, especially as former records are more or less open to be regarded
as inexact drawings or inaccurate statements when they happen to differ from pre-
sent observed appearances, still as instances such as are given above increase, and they
are upon the increase, it will become more and more difficult to put aside the
earlier records. It therefore remains rather, as recommended by M. de Beaumont,

to increase our observations and compare them with the earlier records than to rest

satisfied with the notion that, as no change has been satisfactorily ascertained, it is

unlikely upon certain theoretical considerations that we may meet with any.

            The Meteor Shoiver of August 1868. By George Forbes.

   The author merely stated the results of some observations made on this shower
on the nights of the lOth-llth and llth-12th of August last. The peculiarities of
this shower were for the most part the same as last year. The hom-ly average
number on the first night was 21 on a clear night seen by one person, while last
year the number was 25 on a hazy night by the same person. The radiant-point
was approximately R.A. 2^ 16TM N.P.D 31°. Last year it was nearly the same.

Two meteors traced curves, one of them of a very remarkable form. When a

distinct train was left the meteor was generally noticed to pass beyond tlie end of
the train and to become suddenly extinguished without 2}i'evious diminution of bril-

liancy. No trace of the radiant discovered last year in Pisces was noticed. The

average size of meteors was that of a 4th magnitude star.

                                                                              ACOTTSTICS.

On a Simple Method of exhihitiiig the Combination of Rectang^dar Vibrations*.

                             By "W. Eletcher Barrett.

Physicists are well acquainted with the elegant experiments of M. T.issajous, in

which the -vibrations of two tuning-forks, placed at rectangles, are optically com-

bined by viewing a ray of light successively reflected fi-om a mirror attached to
Aeach fork.
                regular series of cvu'ves is thus obtained which gives a perfect

optical expression of each of the musical intervals, the curves augmenting in com-

plexity as the dissonance between the forks increases.

   Instructive and beautifid as are these experiments, the exti-eme costliness of the

apparatus necessary for their proper exhibition has hiherto debarred many from

repeating them.

Upwards of two years ago the author found a method of obtaining any desired
Acombination by an extremely simple arrangement.
                                                                                                   piece of straightened steel

wire, about No. 16 gauge and some 12 or 18 inches long, is first well softened in a

flame at a point 6 or 8 inches from the end, which length is then bent downwards.

The extremity of the longer portion is fixed in a vice, a silvered bead is cemented

by marine glue on to the summit of the bend, and the instrument is complete.

The whole system is thrown into vibration by smartly tapping the wire near the

point held in the vice, and in a direction oblique to t/ie plane of the tico tcires. The

vibration travels up the wire, rounds the bend, and throws the inclined arni into

motion. The latter, being free, vibrates more easily than the portion which is

fixed  at  one  extremity                                                  a  compound  motion is  thus the result, and the spot of

light, reflected from the bead, describes a curve expressing the resultant action.

The ratio between the vibrations of the two parts of the wire can evidently be

adjusted, or altered, by raising or lowering the point clamped in the vice. The

same end may also be oljtained by loading the free portion of the wire by a little

sliding weiglit. But an alteration in tlie angle of the bent wire yields a more
satisfactory result. M^hen the wh'es are parallel and even in length, a combination
of 1 to 1 is obtained, and the bead describes a circle passing into an oblique line

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

but on opening the free limb to an angle of about 30°, the figure changes into
the complex curve given by the ratio of 4 to 5. Opening the angle still further,
the curve expressing the ratio of 3 to 4 is obtained ; then at 45° 2 to 3 ; and at
an angle of 75° the figure of eight comes out, expressing the ratio of 1 to 2.
In fact, by varying the angle an entire series of combinations, more or less perfect,

can be produced at will.

   Figure 1 shows the instrument. The wire is capable of being firmly fixed at
any height in a support which is attached to a heavy stand, more convenient in

use than a vice.

   Not only may this arrangment be used for exhibiting the combination of vibra-

tions, but it also shows very prettily the formation of nodes and ventral segments.

   On the free arm an instructive change is seen to take place in the position
of a node which is there formed. When the arms are equal and parallel, and a

ratio of 1 to 1 obtained, the node is near the free extremity of the bent wire ; as

                      Fis. 1.                  Fig. 2.

the wire is raised and the angle increases, the node rises nearer to the bend. It is

also worth observiug that, in any combination, the distance of the node from the

free extremity of the wire, compared with its distance from the bend, is approxi-

mately the same as the ratio of the interv^al depicted by the figure.

Another arrangement for effecting the combination of rectanglar vibrations

(shown in figure 2) has been adapted by Mr. Ladd from an instrument devised by

Professor Helmholtz.

Two flat pieces of steel are here welded at right angles to each other into a

single rod. The upper part («, fig. 2) is tapering, and on its summit is fixed a

polished silver bead. The lower part (V) is capable of being firmly fixed in a sui-

table support. According to the height at which h is clamped, so a corresponding

Aportion is allowed to enter into -vibration.  combination of the vibration of a

with that of h can thus be obtained in any given ratio. Complete command of any

figure can be had by marking its position on the lower strip of steel ; and so nice

an adjustment is possible, that an almost absolutely steady figure can be secured

with a little care.

The author proposes to call the instrument described in this paper a Tonophant.

tions the more diathermic liquids exhibited a remarkable aud anomalous deport-
ment towards radiant heat. This obserTation led him to make a subsequent investi-
gation, the results of which are summed up as follows :

   When the more diathermic liquids are introduced between two parallel plates of

rock-salt separated by a very small interval, the raj's from an artificial source are

found to be more freely transmitted than when air intervenes between the plates.
For a space of "02 inch wide the increased transmission amounts with bichloride

of carbon to about 12 per cent., with bisulphide of carbon to 9 per cent., and with
chloroform to 4-5 per cent. This effect disappears and less heat is transmitted (1)

when the transcalency of the liquid diminishes ; e. g. the same thickness of sul-

phuric ether intercepts 30 per cent, of the heat previously passing through the

empty cell (2) when the distance between the plates is increased beyond, say,
                                                            ;
jL of an inch in the case of bisulphide, and J^ of an inch in the case of bichloride

of carbon. The increased ti-ansmission by these liquids reappears, however, in
thicker layers when plane parallel glass plates are substituted for rock-salt, and

continues, apparently indeed augmenting, as the depth of the cell increases, so
far as the experiments were carried. Bisulphide of cai-bon, poured into a cell with
glass sides 1-2 inch apart, increases the heat falling on the pile 6 per cent., and

bichloride of carbon a still larger amount. Altering the temperatm-e or natm-e of

the som-ce, the size of the aperture in a screen behind the cell, or the position of
the cell, makes no material change in these results. But altering the character,

or augmenting the thickness, of the walls of the cell has considerable influence.
For example, if the cell-walls be of glass, increasing their thickness from one- to

three-tenths of an inch raises the heat falling on the thermoscope 6 per cent, when
equal depths of the selfsame liquid are poured into the cell. Again, by merely
changing the parallel sides of the same cell from rock-salt to precisely similar plates
of glass, the very same liquid can be shown to intercept a certain quantity of the
heat falling on the thermo-pile in the one case, and to augment that quantity in

--the other the difference amovmting to upwards of 10 per cent, of the total radiation

through the empty cell.

   The explanation of the foregoing facts may be traced to two main causes. The

increased transmission noticed with Jilms of the more diathermic liquids chiefly

arises from the reduction or abolition of the reflection taking place fi-om the interior
surfaces of the walls of the cell, owing to the optical density of the hquid intro-

duced being nearer to the cell-walls' than that of the medium it replaces. But in
glass cells of considerable depth, retaining the former explanation, the augmented

heat there observed is probably mainly due to an efiect of the refraction of diver-
gent rays by plane surfaces; this gives rise to a concentration of the beam, which

become sensible when accompanied by a great transcalency of the liquid in the

cell. In similar cells with rock-salt ends the effect is not obsen'ed, probably on

account of such cells sifting the beam far less than glass, and thus permitting a

higher absorption of the liquid. Nevertheless even with rock-salt cells the causes

alluded to must necessarily render, to a certain extent, incon-ect the precise absorp-

tion hitherto attributed to liquids. These sources of error in determining the true

absorption of a liqiud or solid can, however, be avoided by employing trvjy parallel

rays ; and these are best obtained from the sun.

  On the Thermal Resistance of Liquids. By Feedeeick Gittheie, F.R.S.E.

   If we wish to get an insight into the specific resistances of the elements and into
the law connecting thermal resistance and chemical constitution, we must examine

liquids rather than solids, because while the former are essentially homogeneous,
the latter are never without structure, and seldom even without texture.

   To examine the conductivity of a Kquid, it must be either heated from above or
cooled from below, in order that convection may be avoided. If the liquid be

contained in a vessel, the difference between the conductivities of the liquid itself
and of the containing vessel will also introduce convection. In spite of the

labours of many able physicists, these difficulties have hindered the prosecution of
16 REPORT 1868.

this direction of research. The chief numerical results are those obtained by

Despretz in his well-known examination of the conductivity of water.

In order to homologate the thermal and electrical phenomena, the term thermal

resistance is used in preference to conducting-power or conductivity. The zero of

thermal resistance is supposed to exist when two bodies of unequal temperature

are in actual contact. If a substance is interposed between the hotter and colder

bodies in such a manner that the heat can only pass between them by means of

conduction through the interposed substance, then the difference between the

quantity of heat which passes when the bodies are in contact and the quantity

which passes when the third substance is interposed, is equal to the quantity of

heat intercepted by that substance, and is a measure of its resistance.

 --The instrument used for this purpose is the " Diathermometer ; " its construction

is as follows : Two conical brass vessels having thin polished platinmn bases are

fastened in a stand in such a manner that their axes are in the same vertical

straight line ; their bases are opposed to one another and are parallel. The apices
of both cones are made tubular. The lower cone is screwed into the stand, its

neck is fitted with a cork and tube, which dips into water, and which carries a

scale. The lower cone and tube form an air-thermometer. The upper cone is
moveable vertically, its motion being commanded by a micrometer-screw, which

is so divided as to allow of the adjustment of the cone to the 0'005 of a millimetre

in vertical direction. The parallel bases of the two cones are adjusted horizontally

by a spirit-level and levelling screws in the stand. The upper cone carries a cork,

through which pass two tubes, one reaching to 0'5 millimetre of the bottom of the

cone, the other opening just below the cork. A. current of water may thus be

Amade to flow through the upper cone.      large vessel of water is maintained at

any required constant temperature by means of a thermostat. Screens intervene

between this vessel and the diathermometer. By means of a siphon and flexible

tubes, a current of warm water of known temperature is allowed to pass through

the upper cone, commencing at any given moment.

The zero or minimum resistance is found by wetting the bases of the cones

with a little mercury and bringing them into contact (the air-film is thus excluded),
and passing water of a known temperature for a given time through the upper

cone. If the calibre of the tube of the lower cone is known, we can, by observmg

the linear depression of the column of water in it, calculate the number of heat-

units which enter the air of the lower cone by taldng into account its capacity, the

specific heat of moist air, and the pressure to which the latter is subjected.

   If, now, the cones be separated to a known distance and a liquid be introduced

between them, it is supported in its position by adhesion and cohesion. When

water is passed through the upper cone under the same conditions as in the experi-

ment when the cones were in contact, a less number of units of heat enter the air

of the lower cone (as is shown by the smaller amount of depression in the thermo-

meter-tube). This diminution in the number of heat-units is called the resistance

of the liquid under the special conditions. As the area of the base of the cones is

known, we can calculate the resistance of a rectangular prism of known base and

height of a liquid for a given time at a given temperature, and for a given tempe-

rature-difference at its two extremities.

The loss of heat suffered by the water in passing from the reservoir was esti-

mated at all temperatui'es and allowed for. The absolute errors due to the absorb-

tion and radiation of heat by the brass of the lower cone and to the accumulation

of heated air in its upper portion, affect equally the determination of the minimum

resistance and that of the intei-posed liquid ; consequently they do not aft'ect the
result, which is their difference.

It was shown by measiu-iug the time required to produce any effect on the lower

cone, as also by interposing paper disks in the liquid between the cones, that the

diathermancy of the liquids at the temperature-differences employed was either

nothing or so small as to be negligible.

Special experiments made by colouring the base of the upper cone showed that

there was no convection.

The resistance (measured by the number of heat-units arrested in a given time)

of a cubic millimetre of about twenty chemically pure liquids was determined

   The column of specific resistance is obtained by dividing the resistances of the
other liquids by that of water. Of all liquids, with the exception of mercury, water
ha.s the least resistance. Of bodies belonging to the same series, those have the
greatest specific resistance which have the greatest molecular complexity.

ratures travelled through water. Through 3 millimetres of water the first effect of

   It appeared from numerous experiments made in this direction that for the above

thickness of water the time for the production of the first effect is diminished
about 1" for every increase of 5° C. in the temperature-difference.

   With regard to the time required for the heat to penetrate different thicknesses

   On examining aqueous saline solutions, it was found that their resistances were
always greater than that of water, even when the metal in solution was a good
conductor, and when the solutions were saturated. From the experiments made

in this direction, it is concluded that the solution of a salt in water affects the re-
sistance of the latter only either by displacing some of it and altering its specific

heat.

a manner that instruments constructed for actinometric purposes by means of a

are

    (1) " That diffused light, on entering a tube at one end only, varies in intensity
·within the tube inversely as the squares of the distances from the apertui-e where

light enters.

    (2) " That any number of tubes, whatever their magnitudes, contain the same
intensity of light if the ratios of their diameters to their lengths are equal, and if
we absorb the light that may be reflected from their sides."

   He then describes experiments which he made by means of tubes of eqiial

diameter, and of lengths varying by a semidiameter and also with tubes of va-

rious magnitudes, the ratios of their diameters to their lengths being equal. By

inserting small mica-actinometers at the bases of those tubes, and exposing them
thus situated simultaneously to the action of light, the wi'iter gains results which
demonstrate the above principles.

Observations on the Atmospheric Lines of the Solar Spectrum in High Latitudes.

                      By George Gladstone, F.C.S., P.R.G.S.

This paper was explanatory of some diagi-ams which the author had prepared

of the atmospheric lines in the solar spectrum, from observations taken by him

during a recent voyage along the north-west coast of Norway. The author stated
                                                                                                                    "
that what                         are  known  by observers of the  solar spectrum  as  the  " atmospheric  lines

are certain dark lines or bands, which make their appearance under certain condi-

tions, and sometimes even attain a considerable development. These lines, or

bands, appear to be due to the presence of some substances in the earth's atmo-

sphere, as they are always most prominent when observing the sun through a long

reach of air (as at sunrise or simset), while they are scarcely visible when the sun

is high above the horizon. The observations, of which drawings were exhibited,

were taken in the months of June and July last, from the deck of the vessel when

servation. It appears that in those regions the red end of the spectrum is very

brilliant, so that with the small portable spectroscope he distinctly recognized, on

two occasions, the remarkable line A. The observations went to show that the

atmospheric band grows in width and intensity as the sun approaches the hori-

zon, and that what in certain states of light, or of the atmosphere, appear to be

bands of shade are under other circumstances broken up into lines. Under some

conditions the red raj's sufter very little diminution of light up to a certain point,

when they are suddenly cut off"; while under others the obscuration takes place

more gradually, and the visible spectrum is much longer. The length of the

spectrum, however, in no case affects the width between the respective lines, which

remains always the same, but is entirely due to more or less of the extremities

being altogether lost in darkness.

On the Value of the Hullow Wedge in examininq Absorption Spectra.
                          Bij Dr. J. H. Gladstone, F.li.S.

The usual way of examining absorption of light by a coloured liquid is to place

it in a test-tube behind a nan-ow slit, and to disperse the line of light by means of

a prism. The black or shaded bands due to the absoi-ption may thus be easily

noted ; but of course they represent only one particidar thickness of the liquid.

Now the number of these bands often varies, and the extent of them always varies

with the depth of the liquid ti-aversed by the light, or, if it be a solution, with the

Aquantity of colouring-matter dissolved.                               great advantage is obtained by substi-

tuting a hollow glass wedge for the test-tube, and so arranging it before or behind

the slit that the narrow line of light examined shall have traversed all thicknesses

from, perhaps, two centimetres to nothing. Thus the vaiying absorption at dif-

ferent depths is seen all at once, and can be easily represented in a diagram which

becomes characteristic of the particular substance. The value of this mode ot

--examining absorption spectra was illustrated by an extreme case permanganate

of potassium ; ordinary drawings of the bands were made for four different thick-
nesses, and the same were expressed in Mr. Sorby's ingenious notation -of numerals
and dashes and dots, which four figures bore little or no apparent relation to one
another, but the}' were explained by, and included in, the figure obtained when the
hollow wedge was employed. Figures were also exhibited showing the absoi-ption
of light by cruorine, haematine, and cineal in alum, which illustrated in various
ways the importance of observing the effect of the varying thicknesses of these

substances.

   The author suggested the use of the hollow wedge as far back as the Cheltenham
Meeting in 1856, and exhibited tliere, and published afterwards, many diagTams of

--absoi-ption spectra thus obtained. The reason why other observers have made

little use of it was believed to be twofold it is too simple to please some, requi-

ring no apparatus beyond a common window- shutter, the wedge, and a good prism,

while it demands a little more thought in adjustment than the test-tube does,

seeing it also bends the ray of light. It may be advantageously placed in front of

spectroscopes of the ordinary form ; and as the prismatic analysis of transmitted
light is becoming a matter of great importance, it seems desirable to adopt the best

methods.

On a further development of the Dynamo-Marjneto-Electrie Machine.
                           By W. Ladd, F.R.A.S.

At the Meeting last year the author brought before the iSection one of his small

dynamo-magneto machines, the first that had been made upon that principle.

The author has since constructed a much larger machine, and it may be interesting

now to give some particidars respecting it. The object in constructing it was to

supply a good electric light for the pm-pose of lecture demonstrations. It is con-

structed upon the double armature principle, both armatm-es being placed end to

end, so that their magnetic axes cross each other at right angles. The short arma-

ture contains 108 feet of very stout copper wire, and sends its cun-ents into 240 lbs.

of copper wire surrounding the electromagnet, exciting a large amount of mag-

netism in the body of the machine. And as the second armature is also made to

revolve between the poles of this electi-omagnet, a sufficient effect is produced at

the two ends of the 312 feet of very stout copper wire (which is wound upon

it) to produce a good electric light from the carbon-poles of the regulator. But in

order to make that light sufficiently continuous, it is requisite that the armatures

should revolve fi'om 1800 to 2000 revolutions per minute ; but as the annatures

have to be magnetized and demagnetized twice during each revolution, there would

Nowbe in the latter case 4000 flashes of light per minute.  it has been shown

that every time iron becomes magnetized it is elongated, and again shortened

when demagnetized. At every alteration, therefore, of the condition of the iron

some small amount of heat must be devolved, and would increase to such an ex-

tent that, if unchecked, it would in the course of time be so great as to destroy the

insulation of the wire.

The author did not wish it to be inferred that the sole cause of heat is due to

the elongation of the iron. Doubtless the electric cun-ents passing through the

wire would produce heat ; but he believed the quantity produced by that means

would be small as compared wilh that produced by the elongation of the iron itself.

The author gave the following reasons for entertaining this opinion. One of these

magneto-machines driven by steam-power was lately used in connexion with a

large inductorium, and after a few hours it was found that the copper or primary
                                                                                                          2*

wire surrounding the core of the coil appeared to be quite cool, while the iron core

itself was considerably heated. The author, therefore, mainly assigned the produc-

Nowtion of the heat to the cause specified.  to remove this heat he had perforated

the two poles of the electromagnet as close as possible to the armatures, and a stream

of cold water circulates twice round the machine. This canies off the heat

in a most effective manner, and no appreciable detriment in its electrical results

occurs.

   The quantity of the mixed gases given off per minute had not yet been ascertained
but it is most interesting to notice the continuance of the decomposition of water
which takes place for some seconds after all motion in the machine has ceased.

   The great advance which the labom-s of Sir William Thomson have made in the
means of determining with precision small equivalents of electrodjTiamic force is

sufficiently well kno-WTi. He has shown the importance and value of using small

cores upon which the electromagnetic helices are wound, and the advantage of em-
ploying small magnets for indicating and measuring the amount of force flowing

through the galvanometer-coil or helix. The small magnet of Sir W. Thomson has a

mirror attached to it to reflect a beam of light, so that a small motion of the magnet
gives movement to a line of light thrown upon a darkened screen. It has frequently
occurred to the author that smaller and lighter magnets could be employed bj^ call-

ing in the aid of microscopic power. Two instruments were constructed with this

view. The first consists in suspending bj' a single filament of silk in the hollow
core of the galvanometer-coil a magnet of an inverted spur-form, made of the finest
steel wire that can be obtained, and rendering its motion apparent by viewing it
through a rectangular prism by means of a microscope, in the ej^epieco of which is
placed a small scale photographed Oii glass : the magnet appears as a black bar bi-
secting the field of view ; and as the finest wire obtainable for this purpose appears,
when sufliciently magnified, as thick as a scaffold-pole, it is ob^-ious that the slightest
motion of the magnet is rendered conspicuous by the image moving to or from over
the graduated scale in the eyepiece. The second form is more sensitive than the
first : a small magnet made of flat steel polished on one face is suspended in the
usual way by a single filament of silk ; a small microphotogi-aph of a graduated
scale is placed at such a distance from the reflecting surface of the magnet-mirror,
that each division equals two minutes of arc as nearly as possible ; the image of the
scale thus reflected is sent in a line with the optic axis of the microscope ; any de-
flection given to the magnet causes the image of the photographed scale to move
across the field of view. The reflecting surface moving doubles the apparent motion,
giving the amount due to the angle of incidence, plus that of reflection. The
movement of one graduated division being produced by a deflection equal to one
minute of arc, if magnified sixty times by tne microscope, will render a motion
equal to one second of arc apparent and measurable. AVhen desirable, a small scale
placed in the eyepiece can be made to give a vernier reading upon the magnified
scale. The magnifying-power can be increased where desired, and most minute
amounts of motion rendered measurable. The great difficulty of using instruments
of such extreme sensibility is due to the interference of extraneous vibration com-
municated to the small magnets. This, to a great extent, can be overcome by in-
sulating the various parts from vibration by means of antagonizing springs, and
preventing the finer vibration from being communicated through the wire itself by

coverinp: the wire with silk or cotton to act as a damper to the more minute \'ibra-

tions. This instrument bein^ more compact, and not requiring a darkened room set
apart for its special use, its application is much more general, whilst it at
the same time gives much more minute and sensitive measurements. The instru-
ment can be used in broad day, either in or out of doors, and is applicable to all

kinds of galvanometric observations.

On a New Automatic Teler/raphic Apparatus. By Prof. C. Zenger.

The Morse telegraph requires much cleverness and practice in the telegraphists

to deliver despatches quickly, con-ectly, and easily legible. To avoid mistakes, and

to get a more rapid mode of despatching, the author constructed an automatical

telegraphic apparatus, intended to make telegraphing with the Morse system quite

independent of the telegraphist's cleverness and practice, to procure signs automa-

tically made of as coiTect a shape as if they were printed. But that is not the only

advantage of  this apparatus                                                                    for it is capable of giving  three  simple signs instead

giving a dot, the second a short line, and the third a nearly three times lono-er one.

with the Morse key there are only 2, 4, and 8, in some 14, possible. There are
much fewer signs required to obtain all letters and ciphers than with the Morse

key, and the despatches become more than one-third shorter than with the common

key. But time is also spared ; because an able telegraphist may more swiftly tele-

graph than with the Morse key ; for the movement of the three levers is uniform,
and may be produced with three fingers put on the keys at the end of each lever.
The movement of the levers produces a similar movement of shorter and smaller

levers, producing a cvm-ent of only momentary duration on the first lever, a longer

on the second, and three times longer on the thii-d. Whatever may be the velocity

of the paper devohnng on the Morse writing-apparatus, the relative length of the

two lines will not be altered, and becomes quite independent fi-om the hand of the
telegraphist. The first lever gives always a dot, or an extremely short line. The

author has found by using this key, which is simply placed instead of the Morse

key in the circuit without altering anything else in the whole Morse system, that

boys and little girls may, after a day's practice, telegi-aph quite well ; and that a

clever telegraphist may reduce the space occupied by the telegram about 30 to 33

per cent., and the time spent nearly 40 to -50 per cent., after a short time of

practice.

The liesemblance and Contrasts of the Climates of the Mauritius and Natal-

   dent of Education at Natal, and Acting Special Commissioner of the Natal

    Government.

   The exact observations on the meteorology of Port Louis, in the island of
the Mam-itius, made by Professor Meldi-umj and printed in the last Report
(1867), acquire additional interest and value when compared with observations
made at the neighbouring continental station of Natal at the same time. The island
of the Mauritius lies in the Indian Ocean between the 20th and 21st parallels of
southern latitude, and 1400 miles from the African shore. The colony of Natal
lies on the border of the African continent, facing the same ocean between the 29th
and 32nd parallels of south latitude. The sun shines approximately with the same
inclination and force on both situations ; and the prevalent movement of the atmo-
sphere is in the same direction in both, that, namely, of the south-eastern trade-
wind flowing from the vast open stretches of the Southern Ocean. But in the one
case the sun shines, and the ocean-wind blows upon a small island only thirty-five
miles across in the widest part, and rising into a tableland 1400 feet high in its
centre, with a rampart of jagged peaks about as high again; while in the other

case the sun falls and the wind blows upon the margin of a land that rises rapidly

to 6000 feet of elevation, and then stretches away for thousands of miles, getting

Aever more and more scorched hj the intertropical sunshine.      very instructive

opportunity is thus afforded for instituting upon a grand scale a careful comparison

worthy deductions may in the meantime be gathered as '"first fruits " of the in-

vestigation.

The actual rainfall is not very different for Port Louis, the capital of the Mami-

tius, and for Maritzbm'g, the capital of Natal. During a series of eight years it
amounted to 241"79 inches, or 20 feet If inch, at the observatory at Maritzburg,
and to 32-4 -33 inches, or 27 feet, at the observatory at Port Louis. The mean

annual fall for this period was 30-22 inches for Maritzbiu-g, and 40'54 inches at Port

Louis. Both stations are placed, so to speak, awaj' from the first impingement of
the moist sea-breeze. But the site of observation at Port Louis is less than 50
feet above the sea, and that at Maritzburg is 2095 feet above the sea.

    In the Mauritius, in the very limited area restricted in the longest extent to

thirty-five miles, there are spots that actually receive four times as much rain as
others. Thus in the year 1862, while the fall was 28-3 inches in the north-west,

52-2 inches on the north, and 69 inches in the interior of the island; at the south-
east extremity, at an elevation of 960 feet, it was 122-5 inches.

   In the colony of Natal the difference between the coast and the capital, more

than forty miles inland and more than 2000 feet high, is onK as 2 to 1. In one
case of carefid comparison, when the fall at the Port of Durban was 22-59 inches,

the fall at Maritzbiu-g was 11-75 inches.

In the Mauritius there is a considerable difference in the amount of rainfall in

different years. In a series of eight years tlie least yearly rainfall at Port Louis

was 20-5 inches, and the greatest 68-7 inches. In a similar range of eight years
the least annual fall at Maritzburg was 22-4 inches, and the greatest annual fall

37-3 inches.

   In the Mauritius the rainfall distinctly increases with elevation up to nearly
1000 feet.

   In Natal the greatest fall certainly takes place on the windward side of the land,
that is, on or near the coast ; and it then (liminishes rapidly with elevation.

   There are no observations yet available to give the fall for the range of country
intermediate between Durban and Maritzburg ; but there certainly is no spot
where the rainfall materially exceeds that of the district near to the sea itself.
The large tract of heated land along which the sea-breeze has to rise, seems at once
to give the atmosphere more vapom--sustaining power, imtil the ascent becomes

sufficiently energetic and turbiUeut to give rise to the periodically recurring

thunder-storm.

The seasonal distribution of the rainfall is remarkably regular on the border of

the African continent, that is, at Natal. There is a distinct division of the year       I
into a wet season and a dry one ; and the wet season most beneficently corresponds

\vith the smumer half of the year. Four-fifths of the rain in Natal falls between
the beginning of October and the end of March, and one-fifth between the begin-
ning of April and the end of September. The midwinter months of June and July
are almost dry. In the two months before and two months after these, the rain-
fall is \\ inch for each month. In the six siunmer months it averages 4J inch for
each month. In the Mauritius 58 per cent, of the rain falls between December
and March, and 42 per cent, during the other eight months. In Natal December
is the wettest month of the year ; in the Mauritius February is the wettest month.
The rainfall in the Mauritius is more concentered in the middle of the siunmer
than it is in Natal, and is occasionally raised to a gi-eat extent in February by the
occm-rence of humcanes.

   In the Mam-itius June and July are dry months, as in Natal ; but there is there
a sort of second dry season after August. October and November are dry in the
Mauritius, but distinctly and emphatically wet in Natal.

   In both situations the general tendency is to increased rainfall with increase of
teniperatm-e, and therefore of sea evaporation, which mounts to the highest point

in February. This agency, however, is somewhat anticipated, and over-ridden, in
Natal, by the establishment of frequent periodic thunder-storms, which begin in

 October.

    The thimder-storm is a very miixili more frequent phenomenon in Natal than in
the Mauritius. Dming a series of seven years lightning was seen, or thunder heard,
on 186 days at the Mauritius. In a series of eight years lightning was seen, or
thunder heard, on 635 days in Maritzburg. The average number of days of elec-
trical disturbance in any year is 26 for the insular position of the Mauritius, and
79 for the continental position of Natal. In the Mauritius lightning is never seen
in the months of Jime, Jidy, September, and October ; and it is very rarely seen in
the month of August.

   Insularity of position thus causes greater diversity and irregularity, and more
widely separated extremes in the deposit of rain, both so far as diiFerent seasons of
the same year and different years of a lengthened series are concerned. But it
exerts exactly the opposite influence in regai'd to temperature. The mean tempe-
rature of the'Mauritius is considerably above the mean temperature of Natal ; but
higher and lower temperatures are experienced in Natal than in the Mauritius.
The great ocean serves as a ready and exhaustless supply of rain, but as a reserve
and reservoir of heat.

   The mean annual temperature of Port Louis is 77°-l. The mean annual tempe-
rature of the sea-coast of Natal (Dui-ban) is 68° -2, and of Maritzburg, 2095 feet

above the sea, 64° 7.

   In a series of six years the highest annual mean at Port Louis was 78°'2, and
the lowest 77' -0. The highest at Maritzburg was 65°-80, and the lowest 64° -27.

of seven years, were, for the two stations,

nine in the morning until three in the afternoon, and rises from three in the after-
noon until nine in the evening. The dim'nal oscillation amounts to 7-hundredths
of an inch at Port Louis, and to 78-thousandths of an inch at Maritzburg. During
a period of eight years there were only 217 days on which the diurnal oscillation
was not distinctly marked at Maritzburg.

   The average yearly range of the barometer is

The highest pressure at

                       Port Louis 30-400 inches. Maritzburg 28-714 inches.

feet.)

   The extreme range of atmospheric pressure during a period of seven years was

At Port Louis 1-391 inch. Maritzburg 1-259 inch.

   The greater range at the Mauritius is ob\'iously due to the occurrence of hurri-
canes there, which do not extend to Natal.

level, derived fi'om a period of eight years, is for

   The diurnal and annual oscillations of the barometer are obviously due to the
rarefying power of day sunshine and summer sunshine. But in Natal there are,

in addition to these, oscillations averaginof about 10 days, for the most part due to
the alternate predominance of the low polar or higher equatorial current of the air.
There were in Natal 291 weU-marked oscillations of this class in a period of eight

years. When the south-eastern sm-face-current (trade-wind) prevails over the

higher north-west compensatory set of the atmosphere, the mercury of the baro-

meter goes up ; when the upper north-west current predominates, the mercury
goes down. The thunder-storm rains occur with the troughs of these oscillations,
and the sea-gales and rains vsdth their crests. Occasionally the upper more rarefied

current entirely displaces the surface-current for a brief period at Maritzburg, and
sweeps upon the gi-ound as a strong hot dry wind. This iVatalian sirocco blows
at Maritzburg about twenty-five times in the year. It occurs most frequently in

the month of September, in which month it may be looked for five times. It

becomes more frequent during the two months preceding September, and less
frequent in the two months following September, thus showing that the alternate
sway of the great antao-ouistic air-currents is really a seasonal phenomenon due to
the march of solar influence to and fro over the wide stretch of African land.
These hot winds do not reach the actual surface of the sea, and are therefore not
felt in full development, either on the Natal coast or at the Mauritius. They are,
however, imquestionably connected with the north-west gales of the South Atlantic.
The gale of the 17th of May, which wi-ecked the mail steamship 'Athens' in
Table Bay, was an oscillation eleven days long, bursting as a hot wind in the crisis
of the gale and barometric depression at Maritzburg.

As stated in a paper communicated to the Section last year, tlie Meteorological

Society of Mauritius has, since the 1st January 1853, been tabulating the obser-

vations recorded in the log-books of vessels visiting the harbour of Port Louis, so

as to form a journal containing information with respect to wind, cloiid, rain, fog,

lightning, &c., and the state of the sea, for each day and, as far as possible, for each

hour; and it is from that journal that the materials for constructing the charts are

mainly derived. Up to the present time, about 215,000 days' observations, each

comprising several observations talcen in the course of the twenty-four hours, have

been tabulated, and a separate collection has been made of numerous details rela-

ting to the hurricanes which have occurred during the same period. Since 1859 the

annual number of observations has considerably increased, and for several years

there is a daily average of fi'om 70 to 80 days' observations, or, in other words, of

70 to 80 vessels on board each of which various observations were taken daily.

The importance of synoptic weather-chai'ts, as a means of studying meteorolo-

gical phenomena, had induced the author to attempt to bring out a series of such

charts about twelve years ago. The observations collected for March 1858, toge-

ther with several charts, were pubhshed in 1856, and daily charts for other months

prepared ; but for various reasons, of which the fewness of the observations was

one, the daily average being only 30, the work was abandoned. Subsequently,

several hundreds of synoptic charts were constructed for periods for which the ob-

servations were more numerous, and it was now proposed to issue those for 1861.

The mean daily number of observations for that year, recorded in Mauritius, was

70, and as the author was to be favoured wdth a copy of those in the Office of the

Meteorological Committee of the Royal Society, the total daily average, including

the observations taken at the Indian and other Observatories, would fall little short

of 100.

In order to render the charts synchronous, the observations are, as far as practi-

cable, referred to the meridian of 60° E., which divides the charts into two equal

parts, and is taken to represent noon. Generally this is easily accomplished with

respect to the winds and weather, which are frequently observed in the course of

eacn day ; the chief difficulty being in applying corrections for the positions of the
vessels at local noon, when tliey happen to be at considerable distances from 60° E.,

and to be going at a rapid rate ; but the con'eotion seldom amounts to 40 miles,

and is often so small that it may be omitted. There is much greater difficulty with

regard to the pressure and temperature of the air. In ordinary weather these are

observed on board ship only at noon. Hence the isobaric and isothei-mal cau-ves, as

given in the charts, represent the pressures and temperatures at local noon, and not

at the same moment of absolute time ; for it is impossible to apply corrections
which would make the observations synchronous. Noon, however, happens to be

nearly the hour when the barometer is at its mean daily height ; and therefore

in usual weather the isobars for local noon probably represent with tolerable accu-

racy the mean pressure for the day at the localities over which they pass. When

the weather is stormy, and the barometer is falling, observations are taken hourly

or oftener                                                so that corrections may be applied.
                                                       ;

After describing the manner in which the observations were reduced and the

results delineated graphically, the author exhibited specimens of the charts, and

called attention to the connexion which apparently subsisted between the several

phenomena, particularly the isobaric curves and the directions of the wind, and

ventured to think that a series of such charts would be of some value. The Mauritius

observations, with those belonging to the Board of Trade, were alone sufficient for

constructing ten years' daily charts of about ninety observations each.

As a method of investigating weather phenomena and discovering atmospheric

laws, there could, he thought, be little doubt that synoptic or synchronous charts

were more important than average charts, in which various disturbances, devia-

tions, and even periodicities were entirely masked. He would go further, and

say that a series of sjTioptic charts for a particular ocean would be of more service

to the practical navigator than average charts, not only in giving him an insight

into weather sequences, but in affording more reliable information as to the winds

and weather likely to be experienced in a certain locality at a certain time ; that,

for example, h^lf a dozen observations of the winds which aetuallv occurred

within a five-degree square, on each of two or three days of normal weather, would
be a better guide to the seaman than a wiud-rose purporting to show the proportion
of different winds often from a small number of observations made unconditionally
in different years and seasons and in all kinds of weather. At all events, without
undervaluing the method of averages and the importance of constants, it might,
he believed, be said that it was to the system of comparing observations taken
simultaneously over extensive portions of the earth's surface that meteorology was
likely to owe most progress for some time to come. Considering the interests at

Whostake, the sooner, he thought, this system was generally adopted the better.

could doubt that if we had had charts showing the directions and force of the

wind, the isobars, &c. over the North Atlantic, the continent of Europe, and the

British Islands, at a certain hour on each day, even for the last twelve months, we

should be in a position to solve, wholly or partly, questions of great importance to
science and navigation ?

       On Storm-Warnings in Mauritius. By Charles Meldrum, M.A.

   By charting the winds and weather over the Indian Ocean for noon of each day

during several years, and examining the connexions between the changes which
took place at Mam-itius and at various distances on all sides of it, the author ascer-
tained that no heavy gale occurred within a distance of at least 1.500 miles the
existence of which was not indicated in the island by the barometer, winds, and

weather. When signs of a hiu-ricane at sea appeared at the Observatory notices

were published in the daily newspapers, stating where the storm was raging, and in
what direction it was travelling. The author explained in detail the grounds upon
wliicli these warnings were issued, showing that there were three classes of gales
in the Indian Ocean south of the equator, and that each of them affected the wea-
ther at Mauritius. As a general rule, the barometer never fell one-tenth of an
inch below its mean height for the season except when a gale existed at a distance,
and the character of the gale, and its bearing and course were determined by the
direction and veering of the wind, the barometer, and state of the clouds and "wea-
ther. These results afforded the hope that similar rules might be successfully
used on board ship in the Indian Ocean. In conclusion, the author expressed the
opinion that the existence and course of storms in extra-tropical countries would
yet be known at a distant station with far more certainty and precision than at
present, for the winds in temperate climates, though more variable, were just as
subject to law as those within the tropics.

       On some Meteorological Results obtained in the Observatory at Home,
                                     By Padre Secchi.

   The author began by stating the necessity that the climate of each observatory

should be accurately known. He then expounded how he has calculated the tem-

peratm-e for everj' day of the year by simply taking the means for forty j^ears of the
same day of the year. The result was, that even after so long a term of observa-
tions, no regular ciirve was obtained, not even if it was tried to smooth the irregu-
larities by Mr. Bloxam's method. The author, however, has not used this method
except for five days, and only to ascertain that the in-egularities did not disappear.

The comparison of the normal curve obtained for Rome with those which are

given for Paris, Berlin, Greenwich, Prague, Vienna, Bologna, show evidently that
these irregularities are not due to chance, since they appear also in many other
places, but that they are certainly an effect of the reaction of the sun's heat on
some particular places of the earth, combined with the law of the successive pro-
pagation of storms. The law of this propagation has been studied, and it was
found that the storms propagate from the British Islands to Italy in about two
days ; and the author pointed out the station of Nairn, in Scotland, as the best
station which may indicate by telegraphic despatch the future state of weather in
Rome. The author afterwards entered into a full explanation of the relation
existing between the magnetical and meteorological perturbations, and he stated

that in Rome these perturbations are signals of approaching storms. He at-

tempted to explain them by the electrical currents which accompany the meteorolo-

gical changes. He said that this theoi-y is not commonly admitted by English

obsei-vers, because, perhaps, there is not in this country so powerful a display of

electricity as on the continent, and perhaps it has not been sulRciently investigated

how far this relation goes. Whatever ma}' be the cause of this difference (if it is

true), it is certainly necessary that it should be thoroughly studied, to which pur-
pose a magnetical observatory with photographic records would be very useful, if
it could be established also in Rome. The author, however, did not attribute all

magnetical variations to meteorological changes. He staled that, from the obser-
vations made in Rome both on the sun's spots and magnetical instruments, a splen-
did confirmation was obtained of the minimum of solar spots, combined with the
minimum of variation in magnetical elements, both in respect to regular and irre-

gular oscillations. The author concluded by insisting on the great advantage
which accrued to the art of navigation in the Italian ports from telegraphic indica-

tions of English meteorological states ; and he noticed that a regular service is

already in activity between Rome and the port of Civita Vecchia for this purpose,

to the great satisfaction of the sailors.

                                  CHEMISTEY.

    Address hy Professor E. Feankland, F.B.S., President of the Section.

At these annual reunions of those interested in Chemical science, it is usual for tlie

President of this Section to take a rapid survey of the progress of Chemistry dur-

ing the past year, and in conformity with that custom, it now devolves upon me to

bring under your notice some matters which may, perhaps, with advantage arrest

our attention for a few moments before we proceed to the actual business of the

Section.

   It may be safely asserted that at no previous Meeting of the British Association

has there been evinced such an amount of interest in experimental science, and espe-
cially in Chemistry, as that which pervades the length and breadth of this country.
The international display of manufactures last year in Paris produced upon British
visitors an impression which, if not quite unanimous in its kind, was almost

entirely so, as regards the resulting conviction, viz. that in the education of the
youth of this coimtry scientific instruction is neglected, or systematically excluded,

to an extent which finds no approach to a parallel in any other great European

nation. There are many, and i confess to being one of them, who consider that
even now our trade and manufactures are suffering to a very marked extent from

this grave defect in our national education. It is thought by some that igno-
rance, on the part of managers and workmen, of the scientific truths upon which
most manufacturing processes depend, has not yet begun palpably to tell upon our

manufacturing prosperity ; but, whatever difference of opinion there may be as to

our present industrial position amongst nations, all agree in this, that without the
extensive introduction of thorough scientific training into the education of those

destined for industrial pursuits, we can no longer continue to maintain that pre-
eminence in manufactures which we have now so long enjoyed.

   The great science schools of the continent have no parallels in this country.
The discouraging way in which scientific studies are being introduced into our
older universities, the lack of the necessary funds for the proper endowment of
professorships, and for the provision of suitable buildings and apparatus in our
modern institutions, and the insignificance of the rewards offered to successful
students in science, have natiu'ally operated most injuriously upon the extension of
chemical culture. Whilst in Heidelberg, Zurich, Bonn, Berlin, Leipzig, and Carls-
ruhe magnificent edifices have been raised, replete with all the newest contrivances
for facilitating the prosecution of chemical studies, we are here still compelled to
give instruction and conduct research in small and inconvenient buildings utterly

inadequate to the requirements of modem chemistry. The large sums spent by

the governments of Crermany and Switzerland upon these establishments suf-
                                                                -- ;;

ficiently testify to their opinion of the national value of chemistry in education.

The laboratory at Ziirich cost £14,000, that of Bonn £18,450, the one now nearly

completed in Leipzig will cost £12,120, whilst the estimates for the Berlin labora-
tory, with its 74 rooms, amount to no les5 than £47,715.

   Such being the comparatively discouraging circumstances under which chemistry
is prosecuted in this country, it is not sm-prising that neither the number of inves-
tigators, nor the amount of new facts added to our knowledge during a given time
will bear a favourable comparison with the chemical activity of other and more
favoured nations. In the year 1866, 1273 papers were published by 805 chemists,
being at the average rate of 1"58 paper for each investigator. Of these, Germany
contributed 445 authors and 777 papers, or 1-75 paper to each author; France 170
authors and 245 papers, or 1'44 paper to each author ; the United Kingdom 97
authors and 127 papers, or l-.Sl paper to each author ; whilst other countries
furnished 93 authors and 124 papers, or 1-33 paper to each author. Our case is
even worse than it appears to be from these figures ; for a considerable proportion
of the papers contributed by the United Kingdom were the work of chemists

bom and educated in Germany, but resident in this covmtry. I am not aware
how far a like comparison as regards activity in research obtains in other sciences

but if the United Kingdom takes a similar position in them, it is nothing less than
a national disgrace that a country, which perhaps more than any other, owes its

greatness to the discoveries of science, should do so little towards the extension
of scientific research.

   Fortunately, however, this national apathy has not been shared by individual
chemists, and the year has not passed without several important additions to our
knowledge. The Master of the jNIint has continued his remarkable researches on
the occlusion of gases by metals. The extraordinary property possessed by some
of the metals, but especially by palladium, of absorbing large volumes of certain
gases, is one of the most interesting of modern observations, and can scarcely fail
to throw light upon that obscure class of phenomena, occupying the border land
between the recognized domains of chemical and cohesive attraction.

   Many cosmical changes, such as the variation of animal and vegetable species,
move too slowly for our study. On the other hand, the sequence of transformations
in chemical phenomena has generally been deemed too rapid to permit of the

observation of anjiihing but the final result. Ilarcourt and Esson, however, have
shown that this ph ase of chemical action can be studied with very interesting results
in the cases of the action of oxalic acid upon permanganic acid, and of hydriodic
acid upon hydroxyl, they have arrived at the following important conclusions :

   1. The rate at which a chemical change proceeds is constant under constant
conditions, and independent of the time that has elapsed since the change com-
menced.

   2. When anj' substance is undergoing a chemical change, of which no condition

varies, excepting the diminution of the changing substance, the amount of change
occurring at any moment is directly proportional to the quantity of the substance.

   3. When two or more substances act one upon another, the anioimt of action at

any moment is directh' proportional to the quantity of each of the substances.

   4. When the rate of any chemical change is aftected by the presence of a sub-

stance, which itself takes no part in the change, the acceleration or retardation
produced is directly proportional to the quantity of the substance.

   5. The relation between the rate of a chemical change occumng in a solution

and the temperature of the solution is such, that for every additional degree the
number expressing the rate is to be midtiplied by a constant quantity.

   In mineral chemistry, an active Member of this Section has done excellent service
by the careful reinvestigation of the compounds of vanadium. Roscoe's researches
have led to the discovery that vanadium does not, as was previously believed,
belong to the sulphur gi-oup of elements, but to the nitrogen gi-oup. The vanadic
chloride, of anomalous vapour-density, is now shown to be a normal oxj^chloride.
The isolation of vanadium will be looked forward to with much interest, since the

atomic weight of this element assigns to it a position intermediate between phos-
phorus and arsenic.

    Chemists had long regarded with regret the labour expended by meteorologists,

on observations made with, the intention of estimating ozone in the atmospliere, in
the absence of any conchisive e\idence of the existence of this subotanco in the air.

It is therefore highly satisfactory that Andrews, to whom we were already so much

indebtedfor om- knowledge of the properties of ozone, has at length proved, that
the reaction exhibited by ozone test-papers, at a distance from towns, is in reality

due to ozone. Thus the numerous observations, extending over so many vears
now attain a value which they did not before possess.

   The synthetical and constitutional departments of Organic Cheniistrv have re-
ceived important additions from the discoverer of the first aniline colour. In pur-

--suing his interesting researches on the salicylic series, Perldu has succeeded in

artiiicially producing coumarin the odoriferous principle of the sweet-scented

Woodruti" and Tonquin bean--besides a number of homologues of this substance.
To the same Chemist we are also indebted for a theoretical paper of great import-

--ance, on the probable diiierence in the value of the four bonds of carbon a subject

which, in its bearings upon isomerism, has long claimed, though it has never re-

ceived, the earnest attention of Chemists.

   Perldn and Duppa have submitted the glj-oxylic acid, originally obtained by them
from dibroniacetic acid, to a searching constitutional investigation, which has led
them to the conclusion that this acid "is identical with the one obtained by Debus
from the slow oxidation of alcohol ; thus establishing the fact that two semi-

--molecules of hydroxyl can unite with one and the same atom of carbon a kind of

combination the possibility of which had been disputed, although au analogous
compound of hydrosulphyl is well Imown.

   Maxwell Simpson, another of the most active and successful workers in this
branch of Organic Chemistry, has continued his researches on the constitution of
succinic acid, and on the direct transformation of cliloriodide of ethylene into

glycol.

   To general Organic Chemistry important contributions have been made by
Stenbouse on chlorauil, and by Griess on the action of cyanogen upon amido-

acids.

   Physiological Chemistry has received a new impulse from the highly instructive
experiments of Crum Brown and Fraser on the connexion between chemical con-
stitution and physiological action. It had been shown by Bunsen that cacodylic acid,

though readily soluble iu water, and containing of per cent, of arsenic, produced,

when administered to animals, no appreciable poisonous efiect, whilst Landolt found

that the poisonous properties of antimony disappeared in the salts of tetramethyl-

stibouium. Messrs. Crum Brown and Fraser have studied the change in physio-

logical action produced by the addition of methylic iodide to the natural alka-

loids, strychnine, brucine, thebaine, codeine, morphine, and nicotine, aud they show

conclusively that the physiological action of these poisons is both gi'eatly dimi-

nished in degree aud completely changed in character. Their experiments also
lead them to the singularly remarkable and important conclusion, that wlien a

nitrile base possesses a strychnine-like action, the salts of the corresponding am-

monium Ijases have an action identical with that of the curare poison. It is well

known that_ curare aud strychnine are derived from plants belonging to the same

ffenm and it                      is,  therefore,  interesting  to  observe  such  a  relationship.
                              ;_

Again, the experiments of Dr. Arthur Gamgee on the action of nitrites upon

blood atford a striking illustration of the successful application of the most deli-

cate processes of chemical analysis to physiological research.

I pannot close this brief and very imperfect summary of British chemical in-

vestigation during the past year without congratulating" the Section on the com-

--pletion of that most -saluable addition to the literature of the science Watt's

Dictionary of Chemistry. The extent, completeness, unity of design, and general

accuracy of this gi-eat work reflect the highest credit upon its talented editor, who

has conferred a boon upon his colleagues for which they can never sufficiently

thank him.

   The statistics illustrative of comparative chemical activity in this coimtry and
elsewhere warn me not to attempt, in these necessarily brief remarks, any analysis

of foreigu_ research. I cannot, however, avoid alluding to one or two out of 'the

--34 REPORT 1868.

   In Mineral Clieniistry, the application of the doctrines of atomicity to the for-

mulation of natural minerals, in'the new edition of Dana's great work, constitutes

an epoch in mineralogy which can scarcely fail to produce in that science results
as important as those which this doctrine has ab:eady achieved in chemistry

proper.

   In Organic Chemistry, Hofmann's discover^' of a new series of cyanogen comr
pounds imparts a new stimulus to researches on isomerism, and will long remain

one of the great landmarks in organic investigation.

   In Kolbe"'s laboratory the yearly harvest of synthetical discoveries has not failed.
The direct conversion "of carbonic anliydride into oxalic acid by Dr._ Drechsel, and
of amnionic carbonate into urea by Ba&^iroff, are amongst the most brilliant achieve-

ments yet recorded in this branch of research.

The "artificial production of nem-ine by Wiu-tz illustrates strildngly the precision

with  which  the  results of  chemical  action  can  now be predicted.                                                                                      The  atomic

theory of Dalton, developed as it has been by the doctrine of atomicity, is rapidly

assuming, for chemical phenomena, the position which the theory of gravitation

occupies in cosniical science.
    Alter a long period of indecision and confusion, as regards the atomic weights of

a majority of the elements, it is gratifying to find that, at the present moment, an
almost complete unanimity, prevails amongst cliemical teachers. Out of upwards
of 900 papers, worked in "all parts of tlie United Kingdom, at a recent examina-
tion connected with the Science and Art Department, the old atomic weights
were emploved in less than twenty cases. It is much to be regretted that this

unanimity does not extend to notation and nomenclature ; as regards the latter, a

much greater imiformity prevails in France and Germany than in this coimtry,
and it is greatly to be desired that efforts should be made to bring about a better
imderstanding "on the .subject. To the student a uniformly recognized nomencla-

ture is perhaps of more importance than a generally accepted notation. For the
present, the realization of the latter appears to be impossible ; but by a little mutual
concession on the part of teachers, and especially of authors, there would be

good hope of soon accomplishing the former.

- This interesting example of heavy ordnance of early date, which has recently

been added to the Museum of Artillery at Wool^\'ich, is one of the large bombards

which have, for about four centuries, occupied positions in the batteries on the

Dardanelles.

   The gun consists of two parts, which are screwed together : each part weighs
about Qtons, the total weight of the piece being 18 tons 14 cwt. 3 qrs. Its ex-
ternal form is cylindrical, tlie muzzle being as large as the breech ; each end of
either separate part carries a projecting moulding which is divided by cross-bars
into recesses. The object of these was not simply ornamental ; the recesses obvi-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,

ously serve the purpose of the holes in a ca,pstan-head, being required to give pur-

chase to the levers employed in screwing the two parts together, and in moving
the gun.- Each piece has" some simple moulding-ornamentation at the ends, and
the external surfaces are subdivided bj- rings or mouldiugs about 14 inches apart.
The total length of the gun is 17 feet, the diameter of the powder-chamber is
10 inches, that of the bore is 25 inches. The two screws which jom the pieces
together, and are 23 inches in diameter, are skilfullj' cast. Some spherical stone
shot received with the gim weigh 670 lbs. ; the charge of powder required being

49ilbs.

   For the purpose of ansSysis, specimens of the alloy were detached from different
parts of the gun ; these were foimd to vary considerably both in hardness and
composition. Samples marked I. and IV. proved to be almost identical with the
best descriptions of gun-metal of recent manufacture, whilst those in which the
amount of tin was larger, exhibited specks of white alloy irregularly dispersed

through the masses. On the other hand, Nos. III., IIIa.," and V. contain higher

   The great gims of the Dardanelles appear to have been produced from the metal
of small cannon ; and there is little doubt that no approach to a uniformity of mix-
ture of the alloys composing those cannon could be attained with the crude means

at command for melting the metal. It is, however, interesting to note that, in
the seven specimens taken from the great gun at Woolwich which have been

analysed, only traces of other metals than copper and tin have been discovered.

Lead and iron were detected in mmute quantities, and traces of antimony and

arsenic were also discovered ; but a careful examination of the specimens for gold,

silver, and zinc failed to furnish any indication of the presence of these metals.

      On KelcuWs Model to illustrate Graphic Formulce. By J. Dewae.

   The author exhibited to the Section a model devised by Professor Kekuli^ to

illustrate the structure of organic compounds. He explained the peculiarity of the

model consisted in carbon, with its four atomicities, being represented by a small
sphere, with foiu- equal wire arms joining the centre of the sphere with the angles
of an imaginary equilateral tetrahedron; the biatomic and triatomic elements by
two and three arms in a plane passing through the centres of small spheres ; the
lengths of these arms being made so as to join two and three of the exti-emities of
the carbon arms. In order to exhibit the facility with which the model could be
used in lecture illustration, he demonstrated to the Section the structure of a number

of organic compounds, both fatty and aromatic. He also showed the ease with

which it could be applied to explain the difterences in the isomeric cyanides and
similar cases. In all cases the model gave elegant symmetrical figm'es, clearly

showing the relations of the different groups in the compounds. He afterwards

referred to certain peculiarities of the model of some importance. The arms
attached to the individual atoms might be looked upon as unit forces, the length
of the arms being considered as bearing some relation to their respective magnitudes.

Now in this model, although the specitic atom has its unit values equal, they are not

the same as the unit values in other atoms. In other words, although oxygen is
biatomic and can saturate two units of the carbon atom, it is represented as a re-
sultant and not as a sum. This prevents the student from confounding the number

of units of attacking power, and any comparison between the values of the indi-

vidual units in different atoms. The author concluded by advocating the judicious

use of such a model in the tuition of organic chemistry, as a great aid in con-

veying clear and definite notions on the aclvuowledged intricate questions of atomi-

city and chemical structure.

metameric ethers named. The determinations were made by the statical method,

and the apparatus constructed so that the two vapours (enclosed in vertical
glass tubes) pressed against each other through one continuous mass of mercury,
and that consequently the difference in tension was obtained directly by the mea-
surement of tlie difference of level of two menisci, \\-hich was effected by means of

a cathetometer.

   The author, after detailing the methods used for preparing and testing the sub-
stances operated upon, gives the result of thirty experiments in a table, of which

the vapour-tension of formiate of ethyl is greater than that of acetate of methyl,
and that the difference increases with the temperature.

                        On the Combustion of Gases binder Pressure.

                 Bn Professor Edavakd Feankland, Ph.D., F.R.S. ^

   The author commenced by slating that the idea of the paper arose from obser-
ving the reduction in luminosity when a candle or gas-llame is burnt in rarefied
air, and the law deduced therefrom was that the diminution of illuminating power
was exactly in proportion to the diminution of atmospheric pressure. Some years
ago, while the author vras on the summit of Mont Blanc at night, he was struck
with the want of illumination in the candles burut in the tent in which they

stopped for the night. He had observed similar results in other elevated regions.

The diminution of the illuminating power was due to the reduction of atmospheric
pressure. The commonly received opinion was that there must be incandescent

solid substances in flames in order to produce a white light ; but if they took an
ordinarj' gas-flame, and placed a piece of paper with writing on it behind the flame,
looking steadily through it, they woidd be able to read the writing as well, or nearlj--
as well, as if the flame were not there at all, thus showing that flame was transparent.

In following out this subject, he had been brought into contact with a number of
flames which emitted a considerable amount of light, but which did not contain
any solid matter whatever. One was metallic arsenic burnt in oxj'gen gas. It
omitted an intense and brillant white light. Bisulphide of carbon also emitted
a very intense light when burnt in oxygen ; indeed so intense that it had been
employed to take instantaneous photographs. This was produced without the
possibility of a solid or liquid matter existing in the flame while the light was
being evolved. If oxygen and hydrogen were enclosed in a soap-bubble or other
light envelope, and exploded, there was scarcelj^ any light produced ; but if they
were enclosed in a strong vessel and exploded by means of an electric spark, an
iuten.se light was produced, tlie pressure or density at the moment of explosion

being ten times as great as that in the previous case. Ignited gas emitted light in

proportion to its densit}'. The luminosity in ordinary flames, such as those of gas
and candles, the author considered to be due to the presence of dense hydrocarbon
vapours. One of the most interesting experiments shown was that of sending an
electric spark first through air under ordinary pressure, and then through air under
double pressure. The residt was that the light of the spark due to ignition of the
air was -sery much increased. The spark was sent also through many other
gaseous and vaporized substances, showing most conclusively that the greater the
vapour-density of the bodies the greater was their luminosity when submitted
to ignition by the electric spark.

                        On Refrctction-Equivalents and Chemical Theories.

                                 By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S.

The refraction-equivalent of a substance has abeady been defined before the

British Association as the refractive index minus unity divided by the specific gra-

vity                    and the largest generalization that  has been made in reference to the matter
                     ;

is that the refraction-equivalent of a compound is the sum of the refi-action-equiva-

leuts of its constituents. If this were universally true, it would be easy to deter-

mine the equivalents of all the elements : but it is certain that some of these have
more tlian one manner of aflecting the rays of transmitted light.

While investigating this subject, the author perceived that the numbers arrived

at for difterent elements or compounds had a chemical as well as physical interest,

and a bearing on certain chemical theories.

Thus Iloscoe has given various reasons for considering vanadium as an element

analogous to phosphorus. If so, it might be expected to have a very high refrac-
tion-eqidvalent. The oxychloricle of vauadiimi was examined and gave the num-

ber 57-8, which, allowing 33 for the chlorine and oxygen, leaves 24-8 as the equi-

valent of ^-anadium, showing an amount of refraction totally difi'ereut from that

of the metals, and comparable only with sulphur and phosphorus. It is also, lilte

these substances, extremely dispersi\'e.

Hydrogen, in the mineral acids, such as sulphuric and hydrochloric, has the

equivalent 3'7 ; but in organic acids, such as acetic or citric, it gives only 1'3, its
--38 REPORT 1868.

usual equivalent in organic bodies. This seems to indicate a diilerence of consti-
tution in these two great classes of acids.

The well-kno-wn group of metals, iron, nickel, cobalt, and manganese give, in

their protosalts, respectively 5-7, 5-8, 5-4, and 5-9, the same number within limits

of probable error; but iron in its ferric salts or in the case of the compound
Acj'anides gives about double that number.
                                                                                          similar case of " Diphotism " occurs

with manganese in its ordinary salts, and in the condition of permanganate where

it was determined at 11'5. Chromiimi and aliuninium belong also to this group,

giving analogous numbers.

There is no appreciable difference in the refraction of solutions of tartaric aud

racemic acids; the first giving 45-25, the second 45'10.

The specific refractive energies of the metals already examined are (with oup or

two exceptions) in the inverse order of their chemical equivalents. If this should

prove to be a law, it may be the means of deciding between the multiple numbers

that are assigned as the chemical equivalents of certain elements.

Note on Metliylacetonamine, Ethylacetonamine, and Amylacetonamine.

Acetonamine is obtained by digesting acetone for many days in a large flaslc

containing dry ammonia, and evaporating off the excess of acetone in a water-
bath. The composition of acetonamine is dven as C^ Hj^ N,.

(011,1)2, or iodide of methylacetonamine

   Iodide of amyl gives rise to a similar body, but the formation of tlie am-,1
compound requires the application of heat. The iodide of amylacetonamiiie,

C^Ili Nj (OjHijI)^, crystallizes from alcoholic solution in pearly scales. Chloride
of amylacetonamine may be formed in a similar manner.

The iodide of ethylacetonamine is more difficiUt to obtain, but its composition

and properties are similar to the methyl and amyl derivatives.

               Note on the Vesicular Structure of Copper.

By Dr. MAXTniEssEif, F.R.S., and Dr. W.' J. ^vssell, F.C.S.

   At the Meeting of the British Association at Manchester, the authors described
some experiments on the vesicular structure of copper, and showed that it might be

produced by the action of such reducing-agents as hydrogen, carbonic oxide, coal-
gas, and charcoal on melted copper containing suboxide. The numerous experiments
made abundantly proved that, with pure copper fused entirely out of contact with

the air, no vesicular structure is produced; but, on the othe/hand, if fused copper

be exposed, even for a moment, to the air, and then charcoal be thrown upon it, or

it be exposed to the action of a reducing-gas as it cools, then vegetation and spitting

of the metal is always produced, and it is found to be more or less vesicular.

This explanation of the phenomenon is apparentl)- so complete and satisfactory,

that the authors would not have again returned to the subject if M. Caron h.""d

not obtained results which lead him to conclusions somewhat' different from theirs.
He fused considerable quantities of copper, some 200 grms. , in a boat within a large

porcelain tube, and was able to obsen-e the changes which the copper underwent.
On passing a current of hydrogen or carbonic oxide through the tube, the copper

being melted, he believes that an absorption of these gases takes place, and since

they are entirely given out again on the metal cooling, this elimination of the gas

causes a spitting aud a vesicular structure in the metal.

M. Caron states fm-ther, that when the vessel which contains the melted copper

is made of graphite, unglazed porcelain, or lime, there is no vesicular structure

procluced                                             in fact, as far as his experiments  go, the  spitting only occurs when the
                                                   ;

fusion takes place in a glazed porcelain vessel. The authors "have repeated M.

Caron's experiments, and can full_y confirm his results so far that, when copper is

fused in a rapid stream of hydrogen and in a f^raphite boat, the copper is not

vesicular, but when fused in a glazed porcelain boat, there are cavities in the
copper. Supposing, as M. Caron does, that hydrogen is soluble in meltecl copper,
it is difficult to explain how this solubility is diminished to such an extent as not
to be appreciable when the not glazed vessel is used. Fm'ther, there is no doubt
(for it is an experiment that has been repeated many times) if copper be fused with a

layer of charcoal over it, and a rapid cm'rent of hydrogen be bubbled through it,

no trace of the vesicular structure is ·\-isible. From the experiments they have
already made on the subject, the authors feel no doubt that the cavities in the

copper are owing to a decomposition of the glaze ; for they find that the glaze is

always much acted on by the copper, that the cavities are always in the lower

part of the ingot where it is in contact with the porcelain, and that the copper,

instead of being vesicidar throughout its mass, is very dense and tough, the

cavities full of crj-stals. What the decomposition is which takes place, and how

the gas comes to be eliminated in this waj^, it will take further experiments to

explain, but the authors have no hesitation in saying that they do not believe

hydrogen is dissolved at all by melted copper.

                        On Paraffin, and its Products of Oxidation.

                 By Dr. E. Meusel and C. Hattghton Gill, F.G.S.

    Paraffin, on being submitted to the prolonged action of dilute nitric acid, or of
potassic dichromate somewhat diluted, and sulphuric acid, becomes gradually
oxidized, and yields a number of fatty acids, the highest term of which is cerotic
acid, C^' H'* 0-, and the lowest acetic acid. The oxidation of nitric acid also gives
rise to the formation of succinic and anchoic acids, owing to a secondary action
of the oxidizing agent on the cerotic acid, formed by the first oxidation of the

paraffin.

   The fatty acids which are formed by oxidation of the hydrocarbons are sepa-
rated from unaltered paraffin by converting them into soda soaps, and dissolving
these out from the paraffin by dilute alcohol. They are then separated by Heintz's
method of partial precipitation, the cerotic acid being finally obtained" in a pure
state by repeated crystallization from a mixtm-e of alcohol and ether.

   The paraffin used melted at oB° C, but could be separated into portions, melt-
ing higher and lower, and was therefore a mixture of various hydrocarbons. It
would not combine directly with bromine, though its hydrogen was easily re-
placed by that element. It formed no compound with sulphuric acid, either fuming
or monohydrated. From all which experiments, the authors concluded that paraffin

is a mixture of various hydrocarbons, of the series C"H2«+2, and that in the
sample employed there was one term of the series having a carbon condensation
not lower than equal to C-'.

          On a Physical Pi-opertji of two Coloured Compounds.

                           By Dr. Edwakd Metjsel.

One of these compounds, consisting of mercuric iodide with argentic iodide, is

obtained by adding argentic nitrate to a solution of mercuric iodide in potassic
Aiodide.
          yellow precipitate is formed, which, well washed and dried at a low

temperature, turns instantaneously red when exposed to a temperature above 50"' C.

The other compound, consisting of mercuric iodide with cuprous iodide, is pre-

pared in the same manner, M-itli the difference of cupric sulphate being added

instead of argentic nitrate. At first a greenish-white precipitate is obtained,
which, when shaken and heated, darkens, gives ofi' iodine and turns red. The

latter precipitate is as sensitive as the silver compound, and rise of temperature

causes it to turn black.

   Both colom-s, allowed to cool, retui-n to their original tint, an experiment which

may be very often repeated with the same substance.

Besides these two new iodine compounds, the author has found corresponding

ones containing lead, gold, &c.

0)1 the Manvfachire of Sidpliur from AlJcali Waste in Great Britain.

                         Bij Dr. LuDATiG MoND.

--Tlie author called attention to a new industry tlie recover}' of sulpliur from

alkali waste, which had made very rapid progress during the past few years. The

importance of the subject had been very ably pointed out in 18G1 by Mr. Gossage,

in a paper " On a History of Soda Manufacture." Mr. Gossage stated that two-

lifths of the total cost for raw materials used for the production of a ton of soda-

ash was incurred for pyrites from which to procure a supply of sxUphur; and it

was well known that iiiue-tenths of this sulphur was retained in the material
Acalled alkali waste, which was thrown away by the manufacturer.
                                                                  problem

was thus presented for solution, which, if it could be effected, would cause a large

reduction in the cost of soda. The author stated that the problem had been very

near a satisfactory solution, and called attention to a process with which his name

was connected. lie took out a patent in 1803 for the process, and its merits had

--been very fully recognized in this countiy. The process was carried out in tlie

followini? wav : The first product of Leblanc's famous process for the manufac-

ture of soda, called rough soda or black ash, was now almost universally lixiviated

with water in an apparatus which was lirst used for this purpose in Great Britain,

and was composed of a number of iron tanks connected in a very simple manner

by pipes and taps, &c., so as to allow the water to enter a tank fiUed with black

ash already nearly spent, and thence to flow llirough others filled with black ash

richer and" richer in alkali, until it met fresh black ash in the last tank, thus

becoming an almost concentrated solution of alkali before leaving the apparatus.

Tlie alkali waste, or insoluble residue of the black n?h, remained thus iii these

tanks deprived of alkali, and as it had been immersed in the liquor throughout

, the whole time of lixiviation, it was consequently obtained in a very porous con-

dition. The tanks were always provided with a false bottom. The whole process

of oxidation and lixiviation of the waste, thougli it was repeated three times, was

Whenfinished in from sixty to seventy-two liours.  the waste left the tanks, all

the recoverable sulphur had been taken out of it, and could no more give rise to

the dreadful exhalations of sulphuretted hycb'ogen, or to the formation of tliose

well-known yellow drainage liquors which had hitherto caused the waste to be so

great a nuisance, the one poisoning the air and the other the water in the neigli-

bom-liood of the Aast heaps of waste surrounding many works. Almost all the

sulphur left in the waste existed in the form of sul]>hite and sulphate of calcium,

which were both innocuous; and together vrith the carbonate and hydrated oxide

of calcium, as well as with a little soda, alumina, and soluble silica, which were all

to be found in the waste, made this waste a very valuable manure for many soils

and crops. By other processes which the author explained, he obtained sulpliur

of a dark colour, the waste from which was turned to advantage and made com-

paratively harmless. By the author's processes fully one-half of the sulphur con-
Atained in the waste was recovered. The cost was small.
                                                         plant for the recovery

of 10 tons of sulphur per week would be about £800 ; and the sulphur could bo
made at £T per ton. The recovered sulphur being veiT pure, was not used to

replace pyrites in the manufacture of soda; but for purposes where Sicilian sulphrr

or brimstone had hitherto been employed, this Sicilian sulphur having a much
higher value than the snlphtir in pyrites, and averaging upwards of £0 per ton.
And so large were the quantities of brimstone used, that the British alkali trade,

in spite of its enormous extent, could 'm\\ produce a small portion of the sulphur

yearly exported from Sicily, which country had hitherto had the monopoly of the

supply of this article.

On Chloride of MeiJu/h'ne obtained from Chloroform hy means of Nascent
                       Hydrogen. B>j W. H. PEniciN, F.R.S.

  From the history of monocarbon derivative, as it stands at present, it would
appear that there exist several bodies isomeric with each other; thus we have tlie
description of two bromides of methyl, the one liquid and tlie other gaseous ; two
clilorides of methylene, the one boiling at o0°'5 ("., and the other at 40" C, &c. Y( t
it is considered by some chemists that this isomerism is improbable, and that
these substances, if reexamined, would be found to be identical.
TRANSACTIONS 01' THE SECTIONS.  41

   This question being one of considerable importance, and bearing- upon the nature

of the derivative of not only carbon but probably of all other polyatomic

elements, the author commenced a fresh examination of some of these monocarbon
derivatives, hoping that an experimental comparison of their properties might in

some degree help to a solution of this problem.
   In this communication only a short account was given of some experiments

upon the chloride of methylene, obtained from chloroform by means of nascent
hydrogen, and which had been previously used bj- Dr. Richardson as an anaesthe-
tic. The reagents employed were powdered zinc and ammonia, which react with

violence upon chloroform.
   The chloride of methylene obtained by this method boiled at about 40°-5 to

41° C, and would therefore appear to correspond to that obtained by Butlerow
from the iodide of methylene. Its formula was determined by combustion and
Gay-Lussac vapour-densities, and these gave results showing it to have the com-
position CHj cL.

   The author proposes to examine the products of decomposition, and also to
prepare a quantity of Regnault's chloride of metliylene from chloride of methyl
and chlorine, that he may compare these tv.'o substances.

Note on the Prejparation of some Anhydrous Sodium Derivatives of tlie Sali-

                       cylic Series. By W. H. Perkin, F.E.S.

   In the preparation of salts or other metallic derivatives of organic bodies by means
of oxides, there is always an equivalent of water produced, unless the substance
acted upon be an anhydride ; therefore if the resulting compound has any tendency
to form hydratcd products, such are nearly sure to be produced, and it often happens
that it is difhcult or impossible to remove this combined water. Having to pre-
pare a quantity of the hydride-of-sodium salicyl in an anhydrous state, it appeared
desirable, if possible, to obtain it anh^-drous at once, and thus avoid the blacKening
and loss which it is subject to unless dried veiy rapidly. This object was eilected
bv employing sodium-alcohol instead of a solution of hydrate of sodium, alcohol
oiilv being liberated wlieu this substance enters into double decomposition with
the'hvdride of salicyl. The hydride-of-sodinm salicyl obtained in this manner is
perfectly anhydrous, and of a beautiful pale primrose-yellow colour.

   Bv treatiuo- salicylic acid with sodium-alcohol, a new sodium derivative, crj-s-

tallizing in needles, was obtained. This product contains two equivalents of
sodium, and therefore con-esponds to the dimetallic derivatives of Piria. It has
the following composition, C^ 11^ Na^ O3.

   Salicine also yields a sodium derivative, when treated with sodium-alcohol,
having the formula C\^ H,. NaO-. This body is but slightly soluble in alcohol,

.and not very crystalline. It is deliquescent.

       On SuljjJiocycmide of Ammonium. By Dr. T. L. Phipson, F.C.S.

    In this paper the author alludes, first, to the estimation of sulphocyanogen in

a mixture of sidphate, chloride, and sulphocyauide of ammonium. He effects this

by precipitating the slightly acid solution 'by a mixture of equal equivalents of
sidphate of protoxide of iron and sulphate of copper. The precipitate dried at
100° 0. contains Cu-^, C" NS^.

   Attention is next called to some properties of sulphocyanide of ammonium.
The author finds that this salt produces a great degi-ee of cold in dissolving rapidly
in water. Half a litre of water at 96° C, poured on 500 grms. of the impure salt
extracted fi'om gas-liquor, caused the thermometer to sink to 2°._ In a more exact
experiment, 3.j grms. of pure sulpliocyanide of ammonium, stin-ed rapidly with
35 cub. centims of water at +20'' C.,the thermometer descended in a few seconds
to --10"; tliu moistm-o of the atmosphere condensed itself in plates of thin ice on

the exterior of the glass vessel.

   It is next shown that the alcoholic solution of this salt presents the peculiar
phenomena of siipersaluration in the highest degree.

very remarkable. Tliese bodies are absorbed in large quantities by the concen-

which agrees with the formula C'* H^ N^ S'* 0, formerly admitted by Herr Voelkel,

and not with that of Laurent and Gerhardt, which demands 24 of N, and nearly

55 of S (C" N" HS'') ; these authors, however, estimated only tlie CII and S ; theii-
nitrogen was obtained by difiereuce.

General Outline of cm original System of Chemical PhilosopJii/, comprising
   the Determination of the Volume-equivalents, as also a new Theori/ of the
   Specific. Volumes of Lic^uid and solid Substances. Bij Otto KicnTER,
    Ph.D.

In this paper the author proceeds upon the hypothesis that the chemical

elements consist not of individual atoms, but of entire groups of such atoms, in

other words, of molecules. The A-arious kinds of elementary molecules agree in

being, each and all, built up of precisely the same number of atoms, Avhich are

symmetrically disposed with reference to the three axes of space, according to the

same fundamental plan of arrangement. The constituent atoms of these elementary

molecules are each and all endowed with the same tliree fundamental properties of

graA-ity, original elasticity, and electrical euergy, aud these properties \axj in range

and intensity with each species. In harmony with the common practice, the

chemical elements are divided into the two principal classes of tlie metals and the

non-metals, represented respectively by the general l'ormid;e Mt^ and Nt.,. The con-

stituent atoms of the molecules, from the simplest to the most contplex, are fiu--

ther supposed to be in a perpetual state of Ailjration, in which they perform a

series of periodical contractions aud expansions, and thus, in their final eilect,

establish between contiguous molecides a permanent tendency to repulsion, the

result of which is the formation of a certain space round the centre of each mole-

cule, which constitutes its specific volume, and is always directly proportional to

the number of atoms set in motion. The voliune-equivalents represent the maxi-

mum specific volumes which the elementary molecules are capable of realizing

and the peculiar force, under the influence of which the vibratory movements of

maythe atoms  «^^ libitinn be arrested or restored, is cnlled. '^ the jmrali/tic force.'"

The order in which this force performs its operations in the complex molecules

materially depends upon the partictdar position which the various constituents

occupy in the system relatively to each other. This law of Rankorder is indicated

in the table of chemical equivalents, in so far as any chemical element which

stands to the left or to the right of any other is supposed to occupy in a certain

sense a similar position in comparison with any other with Avhich it happens to

be associated as a constituent member of the same type. Tlie science of chemistiy

is divided into two parts, "Pondo-chemistry and Impondo-chemistry.'' The former

treats exclusively of the molecular arrangement of the constituents, tlie latter exclu-

sivelyof their specificvolumes. Pondo-chemisti'yis di^aded into the twoprincipalsec-

and includes eleven distinct types, and of para-clieniistiy, which is subject to the

principle of parality, and includes three distinct types or forms of moleculftr gi'oup-

ing. After giving a general description of these various types, the author discusses the

law of volume-harmony, according to which the volumes of the constituent members

of a given volume-harmonious molecvde are always reducible to some simple ratio

volume-harmonious molecules are divided into two classes. The first class com-

prises all those compounds where the water of crystallization is excluded, and the

second class all those compounds where the water of crystallization is present. As

regards the latter class, it is a characteristic peculiarity that in the process of

reduction the saline molecule, with every fresh addition of one molecule of water of

crystallization, experiences a loss in volume amounting alwaj's to a constant quan-

tity. This quantity remains imaltered so long as this loss in volume is caused by

the successive paralj'sation of its envelope-molecules ; but when this process of

reduction extends to the molecules of the nucleus, the constant quantity in some

cases continues the same, but in general it merges into another constant quantit3^

              Analysis of the Homan Mortar of Burgh Castle, SuffoVc.
                                By John Spiller, F.G.S.

   The samples of ancient Homan mortar which form the subject of this memoir,

were detached for the purpose of analysis in the years 1803 and 180(5. They all
had the reddish colour (due to the admixture of pounded brick) which is con-
sidered to be characteristic of a Roman origin. The details of construction, dimen-
sions, and other particulars relating to Burgh Castle, the Gurianonum of the
Konians, were brietly described, and a water-colour sketch of the cantrum exhi-
bited. The walls, which are of rubble masonry and about six feet in thickness,
are faced with flints and triple layers of red tiles, set with great regularity.

   Adoptmg Mr. C. Roach Smith's opinion respecting the antiquity of the cas-

trum, the chemical problem resolved itself into a study of the following leading
points in reference to the hardening of the mortar, and changes occurring during

a period of about fifteen centuries, viz. :

   1st. To what extent the hydrate of lime becomes recarbonated by exposure to

air?

    2nd. ^^'hat is the physical condition of the carbonate sd prodhced ? and
   3rd. Whether in this long interval the silica and lime can directly imite with
each other ?
   The conclusion to which the author was led by the chemical examination

of the ancient mortars from Burgh, Pevensey, and other Roman castra, is that the

lime and carbonic acid are invariably united in monatomic proportions as in the
original limestone rock, and that there is no evidence of the hydrate of lime
having at any time exerted a power of corroding the surfaces of sand, flint, pebbles,
or even of burnt clay, with which it must have been for lengthened periods in
contact. Further, that the water originally combined with the lime has been
entirely eliminated during this process of recarbonation, and, this stage passed, the
amorphous carbonate of lime seems to have become gradually transformed by the
joint agency of water and carbonic acid into more or less perfectly crystallized
deposits or concretions, by virtue of which its binding properties must have been
very considerably augmented.

   The analytical method was described, and the following results were reported as

expressing the composition of the Roman mortar, and also of the red bricks or

tiles, which are remarkable for their fine texture and excellent manufacture.

 Oil the Ahsorption of Gases Ij/ Charcoal. Bij Dr. R. Angus Smitii, F.B.S.

   The author said that he had somewhat further extended his inquiries into the

laws of absorption of gases, as shown by charcoal. He had some years ago said

that he believed the actions were on the border between chemistry and physics, or
that physical phenomena were an extension of the chemical. Last year, in a short
note, he stated that the gases which he tried were absorbed in whole volumes, or

^·olumes which were multiples of hydrogen. He had now tried other gases, with

--the following results : Hydrogen,!; oxygen, 7'90; carbonic oxide, G-03 ; carbonic

acid, 22'05; marsh-gas, 1001 ; nitrous oxide, 12 -90; sulphurous acid, 3G-9o; com-
mon air, 40-003. Nitrogen was found to be 4-27 ]n-obabl3' this is a little too low,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

as there is always some nitrogen left in the heated charcoal. These numbers are
got by dividing the number of volumes absorbed by each gas by the A-olumes of

hydrogen absorbed. They are an average of many experiments. The numbers in

some cases differ considerably ; it is supposed that the reason lies in the constitu-

tion of the charcoal, but it mxy be partly owing to the mode of working.
   He considered that the ultimate particles of gas rested as strata or layers in the

charcoal ; the outer particles were tlierefore less forcibly held than tlie more dis-
tant. The latter were also most diflicult to remoA"e. If this physical action had
an analogy with chemical action, it would probably throw [light upon it, and it
seemed to point to compounds containing parts held together more or less loosely
than other parts. The gas and charcoal form such a compound, which in a sense is
not purely chemical

   Two of tlie nundjers seem to be very remarkabh' ; namely, those of oxygen and

carbonic acid, as the volumes are exactly tliose of the weights ofoxygen in water and
of an atom of carbonic acid. Eight volumes of oxj'gen are 128 times heavier than

ing to tlieir atomic ·v^eigllt3. By attention to this, lie boped that some light would

be thrown on the physical atomic coustitiition of bodies.
   In a practical point of view, he hoped to gain by the inquiry some knowledge

of the phenomena of spontaneous combustion to which several substances are sub-

jected.

   Experiments on the absorption of mixed gases had been made, but were left for
future description, and also those on the extrusion of one gas by another.

   Experiments on salts were not sufficiently telling, and a better mode of making
them had to be found ; but it was clear to him that (he charcoal took up most
readily those oxides the metals of which were less inclined to oxidize. Tlie com-
binations being weaker, the bases were removed from the acid, a struggle against

chemical action existing. In other words, an action with little chemical character
opposed itself to the purely chemical, and ljy aid of mass gained sometliing, a phe-
nomenon which is frequent whenever chemical action is weak, and one which in-

terferes much with exactness in analysis.

                  On the Action of Nuclei in inducing CrystaUization.

                                  B)j Charles Tomltnson, F.R.S.

   It had been noticed during the last three-quarters of a centmy that solids acted
as nuclei in liberating gases from their solutions (soda-water, champagne, &c.),

or in inducing crj-stallization in saline solutions, ouh' under certain conditions. If
they had been previously exposed to the air, they were " active ;" if kept in water,
and dried out of contact with the air, or if passed through llame, or boiled up with
the saline solution, they become " inactive "' as nuclei. Hence it was supjiosed

that there was some mysterious property in the air which converted " inactive "

into " active " nuclei.

   The anthor explains the action of nuclei with reference to differences in the force

of adhesion acting on chemically clean or chemically nucleau surfaces. If chemi-
cally clean, the solution, whether of gas in water or of salt in water, will adhere to
such surfaces as a whole, and there will be no separation either of gas or of salt.
But if by exposure to the air, or by handling, &c., a nucleus, such as a glass rod, be

made chemically nuclean, the force of adhesion will be different. The gas or the

salt of the solution will adhere to the unclean surface ; the water of the solution
will not do so, or, at any rate, but feebly ; hence there will be a separation of the
gas or of the salt, and the nucleus will be " active " when, in fact, it is simply

unclean.

  When supersaturated solutions are kept in clean tubes and protected from the

air by having the mouths plugged with cotton-w-ool, many of them may be kept
during a long period without any separation of the salt. They may even be re-

duced to low temperatures, approaching zero (Fahr.), without change of state.
During a rising barometer air enters the tubes, the cotton-wool liltering it from
the motes and dust which act as nuclei, the air itself not being a nucleus. During
a falling barometer, on the contrary, air escapes from the tubes, and drags away
with it some of the aqueous molecules of the solution. The effect of this action,
then repeated, is to depress the liquid-surface and leave a ring of salt just above it.
This salt being chemically clean does not act as a nucleus to the rest of the solu-

tion ; and the latter being supersaturated does not dissolve it. "VVe may even

lower clean crystals of the salt (the magnesic sulphate is well adapted to the expe-
riment) into a cold highly supersaturated solution, without any action on their
part as nuclei in inducing crystallization. The author described two experiments
of this kind with magnesic sulphate ; and in answer to an objection that in nursing

a crystal of alum, for example, we must be dealing with chemically clean surfaces,

he showed that in such a case none of the conditions of chemical purity were ob-
served ; the evaporatiug-dish and the solution exposed to the air were chemically
unclean, as was also the hair by which the crystal was suspended, while the crystal
itself was frequently handled, and abnormal growths chipped off with the thimib-
nail ; the result of all this being the production of an opaque octahedron from
the deposit of a multitude of minute crystals upon chemically unclean facets.

--46 REPORT 1868.

   The author's definition of a chemically clean surface is as follows :

  A chemically clean surface is one that has on it no film or coatinp: of any sub-

stance whatsoever Ibreig-n to its own composition. As oxidation by the air, organic
matter, and floating motes are the most usual forma of films, it may be said loosely,
that any substancethat has been exposed for some time to the air is chemically

unclean ; but speaking strictly, a film of any foreign matter will render a surface
unclean for some conditions or other in the experiments in hand.

  A chemically imclean surface, then, may be generally defined as anything that

is exposed to the products of respiration or of combustion, or to the touch, or to
the motes and dust of the air, and so Ijecomes covered with an invisible film more
or less organic. So also any vessel or surface wiped with a cloth that has been
exposed to the air is chemically unclean.

                Note on Sea-iuater. By Professor J. A. Wankltn.

   It has been shown during the pastj'ear that deep spring-water contains no organic
nitrogenous matter, and that the water of rivers and lakes contains nitrogenous

oro-anic matter in the proportion of about one part of nitrogenous organic matter to

a million of water. The water of the sea contains about one hundred times as much
solid matter as the water of rivers and lakes. The author aslced himself the ques-

tion whether the nitrogenous organic matter increases in anything like that pro-

portion. An examination of sea-water collected oft' the coast of Devonshire (at

TeigTimouth) has been made accordingly, with the object of answering this query.
The result is that there is about double or treble as much nitrogenous organic
matter in sea-water ; so that the total solids increase far more rapidly than the

organic matter.

             Researclies on the Ethers. By Professor J. A. W.^nklyn.

   Five cubic centimetres of good acetate of ethyl and 0-3 grm. of sodium were
sealed up in a small glass tube, and then heated in the water-bath to 100° C. imtil
all the sodium had disappeared. The tube was then opened under water, and the
gas which escaped measured 2o cubic centims. at the ordinary temperature of the
air. Reduced to 0° C. and 7G0 millims. pressure (dry), the volume of the escaped
gas is about 2.3 cubic centims. If the volume of hydrogen whicli is equivalent to
0-3 grm. of sodium be calculated, it will be found to be about 140 cubic centims.
Therefore this experiment establishes the fact that there is no evolution of hydro-
gen as a main product of the action of sodium on acetic ether. Moreover the 23
cubic centims. of gas which escaped must be regarded as due to traces of alcohol
in the acetic ether, and not as arising from minor secondary reactions on the acetic
ether. About 2 per cent, of alcohol present in the acetic ether (and such a quan-
tity was A'ery probably there) is suflicient to account for 23 cubic centims. of hy-
drogen. Another sample of acetate of ethyl, which had been very carefully pre-

--pared, evolved no gas at all when acted on by potassium or sodium.
   Acetate o^ Amj/l find Sadiiim. Tlie acetate of amyl was very carefully deprived
of all traces of amylic alcoliol by being treated with glacial acetic acid and hydro-
chloric-acid gas. After this treatment it gave correct numbers on titration. 0-6
grm. of sodiiun and 11 cubic centims. of acetate of amyl were sealed up in a small
tube and heated to 100° C, until all the sodium had dissolved : the tube was then
opened under water. Not a trace of gas was evolved. (Calculating the quantity
of hydrogen equivalent to the O'G gTni. of sodium, it will be found to exceed 250

tims. of dry common ether,

    Valerianate of Ethyl and Sodium. There is not the slightest evolution of gas

--when these materials act on one another.
   JBenzoate of Ethyl and Sodium. Pure benzoic ether and sodium and common
ether were sealed up and heated in the water-bath. There was action, but no evo-

lution of gas.

   From these experiments it is abundantly evident that free hydrogen forms no part

of the product of the action of sodium on the ethers of the fatty and aromatic acids.
   All the modes of explaining the action of sodium on acetic ether adopted by

Geuther, Franliland, and Duppa must therefore, in the author's opinion, be aban-
doned. The memoirs of these chemists agree in representing the action of sodium

as consisting in the evolution of an equivalent of hydrogen for every equivalent of
sodium consumed. Thus Geuther writes the following equation to express the

action of sodium on acetic ether :

        Acetic ether.        Ethylate of sodium. New body.

        aC^H^O, + Na, ="NaC,H3 -f- CeH.OjNa 4- H,.

Frankland and Duppa write :

        4C,H,02 + Na, = 2CjHeO + 2CeH3 03Na -f H,.

Also :  2C^H,02 + Na^ = CoH,0 -f C^U^O.^a., + H^.
Also :       2C,H3 0, + Naj = 2C,H,NaO, -I- H,.

Also :

                    C^HeO^ + 2sX = CiH^Na^O, + H,.

   All these equations affirm the evolution of as many equivalents of hydrogen as
there are equivalents of sodium consumed. From this view the author dissented.

   In order to accoimt for the different results given by the eminent chemists just
referred to, it wiU perhaps be enough to mate the remark that they appear to
have omitted to measure the equivalent of hydrogen, which nevertheless ap-
pears in their equations*. The author on former occasions represented the action

of sodium on valerianic ether as consisting in the replacement of the acid-forming

radical by sodium and the generation of free valeryl or sodium-valeryl, according

Ato circumstances.  mode of representation of this kind will have to be adopted

by chemists for the explanation of the reaction between sodium and acetic ether.
Geuther, Frankland, and Duppa agree (here the agreement rests on an expe-

rimental basis) in representing a body having the formula C,, H^ O, Na as a

product of the action of sodium on acetic ether. Geuther obtained and analyzed it,

and also the hydrogen, ethyl, and methyl derivatives of it. He also prepared some

derivatives containing various heavy metals ; and he investigated quantitatively a

very interesting decomposition in which vrater plays a part, and in which acetone,
alcohol, and carbonic acid are produced. Franlcland and Duppa have prepared the

ethyl derivative. Altogether it is well made out that C,, Hg 0, Na is produced, and
that it is the main, if not the only, new compound directly resulting from the action

of sodium on acetic ether. Verj^ complicated names have been given to it, ^dz.
" sethylen-dimethylencarbonsam'e-natrou " by Geuther, and " etliylic sodacetone-

it will be seen that it is equal to three equivalents of acetyl and one of sodiimi,

a new organic acid is the product, and that no gas is given off. (Aim. der Chem. und Pharm.
vol. xxxvi. p. 297.) In 1864 (Jouni. Chem. Soc. vol. ii. p. 371) I called attention to these
old researches and confirmed the result in a general way. I showed that sodium and acetic
ether might be heated in a bath, the temperature of which was 130° C, without any consider-

able evolution of gas of any kind.

   The formation of alcohol in this reaction is a virtual conversion of acetic acid
into alcohol, inasmuch as the triacetyl came from acetic acid.

   In the author's opinion the compounds mentioned in Frankland and- Duppa's

sodium triacetyl, and products derived from sodiimi triacetyl.

On Chemistry as a Branch of Education. By Thomas Wood, Ph.D., F.C.S.

The author divided chemistiy, for the purposes of education, into two distinct

and separate studies, first, chemistry as a branch of education teaching facts usefid

to he known, and secondly, chemistry used as an instrument or means of general,

intellectual, and practical training. To teach the former, the head of a school need

not invest in either apparatus or a lahoratoiy, as a few well-illustrated lectures are

sufficient to enable the pupils to read up the subject. For these the lecturer could

bring the necessaiy apparatus. The latter necessitates attendance in a well-ap-

pointed lahoratoiy. With respect to the former, the author considered the subject

imder three   heads                                    to whom could it be taught ?                                                                                                              how most easily and practically ?
                                           ;

when, and at what age ?

With regard to the first of these, he would say, from personal experience, that the

most elementary and usefid facts of chemistry might be taught to all, from the child

of six to the man of sixty ; but it woidd be impossible to teach chemical arithmetic
to a youth who had not learned common arithmetic.

As to the second, among the readiest means of communicating to a person the

facts of chemistry were well-arranged lectures and classes, where the master per-
formed the experiments and the pupil looked on, the latter not being allowed to

take part in the manipulation of the experiments. The mind of the pupil was thus

free to observe and store up all that occurred. The author drew a great distinction

Abetween lectures and lessons.                         lecture was a formal discourse, generally to a

comparatively large number of persons                                                                                                                                                   while a class  lesson implied a much more
                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

intimate communication with the master in the way of question, reply, &c. In a

class, although the subject might be diy and dull, the master could command an

amountof attention from a limited number of pupils ; whereas with one hundred

piipils, if the lecturer were dull, or the subject too dry, he would have little atten-

tion paid to him. All lectures should be interesting as one of their first recom-

mendations, and also attractive. At lectures questions should be rarely asked,

but at lessons continually. The plan of giving a printed list of questions on

each lectm'e to every boy, the lecturer to answer all the questions seriatim in

his lecture, and the boys to answer the questions on paper afterwards, was strongly

recommended. The author thought six was a good number for a chemical clas.^,

and it ought not to exceed eight. With reference to the age, although it was quite

true that many young persons were capable of receiving benefit from experiments

on the elementaiy parts of science, yet it must be confessed that few facts and little

real useful inforniation could be permanently lodged in their minds until they were
capable of working decimals.

   Under the head of chemistiy, as a means of general intellectual and practical

training, the author asserted that up to the present it had never been properly

taught in schools as a means of education. To use chemistiy with this object,

the student must spend not one hour, but hours at a time in the laboratory.

This took up so much time as to be impi-acticable in the present school cmTiculum,

and required a larger number and a better educated class of men than at present

existed aa teachers of practical science. The author also contended that laboratory

practice was only suited for boys of fourteen years and upwards. The plan never

having been thoroughly tried, heads of schools did not believe, from past experi-

ence, that there were really the benefits to be derived from chemical study which

its advocates maintained. The present method of teaching practical chemistry

in schools is b^ qualitative analysis only ; that is, by testing according to the
plan laid down in analytical tables. This gives neither accuracy of manipulation,

thorough or exact knowledge of the science, nor interest to the pupils, and is there-

fore  almost  useless                                  consequently chemistiy                                                                                                           had  as  yet never been  practically  t^nught

50 REPORT-- 1868.

Afi a means of intellectual training, mathematics or classics wore generally em-

ployed, and were greatly in favour ; but there was this main distinction between

--mathematics and practical laboratory work in mathematics the exact data were

all given, in practical chemistry they were not. Thus a student in the laboratory

ought to have con-ect reasoning inculcated, or, as Professor Faraday called it,

--judgment, independent thought on facts, habits of observation, and p.atience " to

learn to labour and to wait." It is because schoolmasters had hitherto seldom

seen a corresponding benefit accrue either to themselves or the boys for the

expense and frequent annoyance caused by the so-called teaching of practical che-

mistry, that this branch of study is in such ill odour. Chemistry could not be

taught in the same cut-and-dried manner as arithmetic &c. It required patience,

carefulness, thought, judgment, accuracy, and could not be hurried. Practical

science was not the accumulation of mere facts, but required the assistance of the

eye and touch. From experience the author could bear witness to the fact that

masters, university men, who had wished to learn chemistry so as to be able to

teach it to boys, were always in a hurry, and could not wait to properly perform

Atheir experiments, imagining that there was some royal road to the result.

student when in the laboratoiy should be made to perform each experiment

thoroughly. After the usual experiment (to make hydrogen, for example) had

been performed, he should be made to take an atomic proportion of zinc, say 650

grains, and dissolve it, collect all the hydrogen from it, and measure it, evcaporate

the solution of zinc, and estimate the quantity of sulphate formed. This could not

be done at one lesson. On the next occasion he would have his mind brought back
to the subject of hydrogen while commencing a new experiment. By the end ot

the third lesson he would probably have the first experiment finished, the second

to continue, and be ready to commence a third. But if from carelessness &c. ho

did not bring the first experiment to a satisfactory conclusion, he shoidd be made

to repeat it until he did. Thus he would for his own sake learn to be carefid and

patient. It may be objected that a great loss of time takes place in this way. But a

fortnight spent in the proper performance of such an experiment, if it be only even-

tually well done, is not time; lost or wasted. At present, boys nominally learn

chemistry ; but they do so without learning the great lessons that a proper study

of chemistry ought to teach. The author proposed, in order to meet the difficulty

of the study taking up so much time, that all large schools of, say, 150 boys should

have their own laboratory and a resident master thoroughly capable of managing

and teaching boys science. That all boys of fourteen and upwards shoidd give up

three days in the week, for at least six months, to the laboratory. For small schools

there should be a united ancillary establishment in each neighbourhood, for the

Aexpress purjiose of giving boys this practical laboratory education.  proper science

teacher ought to be a man of university education, and a thorough practical mani-

pulator. Men would devote themselves to this work if there wa.s a prospect

of their earning a livelihood. At the universities natiu'al science was looked down

upon and not encouraged. Talk of studying science for the love of her, very few

would, and very few could, make the necessary sacrifices, as long as all the money

and all the university honours were reserved for classics and mathematics. Thus
Athere was little inducement for the student to study natural science.
                                                                        man

could not be fitted to become a teacher of practical chemistry by reading alone, not

by six months' practical laboratory work ; the preparation required several years.
Heads of schools had no difficulty in getting first-class university men for £300 a

year ; but these could not teach in the laboratory. Chemical science had never yet

had a fair chance as a means of education ; nor had schoolmasters generally correct

ideas of what the science was capable of doing,

Address by Robeet A. C. Godwin-Attsteij, B.A., F.E.S., Sj-c, President

               of the Section.

The basiu of the Noi'th Sea, in tlie physical changes which it has undergone since                          \

the commencement of the Kainozoic period, is an area which well repays the study                            \/
of the geologist. Suffolk and Norfolk, which geologically, as they do ethnologically,
form one region, are part of the slope of this basin on its western side ; for the                           V
North-Sea valley is a true physical depression ; the whole secondary series of strata,
on one side, dips eastwardly towards it, and rises again above the sea-level, on the
opposite side, in Denmark. It is a depression which dates back its origin to some

distant time in geological history.
    It is to this area that I propose to restrict myself in those observations which,

in compliance with established custom, I have to make in opening the meetings of

this Section.

   The North - Sea depression, in its kydrographical featiu'es, deserves a passing

_^^notice. Compared with its breadth, its depth_at^_present is exceedingly smalL

There are central portions where there are only twelveTeei oFwater. The "Deep-

water Channel " of the charts, which runs parallel with the coasts of Essex, Suf-
A "^folk, and Norfolk, has a maximum depth of only 180 feet.
                                                 change to that

amount of depression of sea-level would lay bare the whole of the sea-bed from

Athe coast of Northumberland across to Jutland.  depression of only 120 feet

would produce nearly a like result ; the new coast-line would in this case run

from Flamborough Head to Heligoland and Holsteiu. There would be an extension

of the gi-eat Germanic plain nearly to our area. The " Deep-water Channel

alluded to would in either case become the course of the Thames and its tribu-

taries, till it found its way seawards to the west of the Great Banks. To such an

extent would this small amount of change of water-level alter the whole physical

character of Eastern Europe ; and yet this change would be insignificant, compared

with those which this very area has repeatedly experienced. There is one other

Afeatm'e presented by the North-Sea basin.  deep submarine trough has been

traced, at a mean distance of about fifty miles from the coast-line of Norway

it commences in the meridian of Christiania, and, conforming to the outline of
the land, goes north beyond N. lat. 60°. South of the Naze of Norway, there are

soundings of upwards of 200 fathoms; beyond they are less, but whether the

decrease is progressive is not clear. Across the line of greatest depth the change
is abrupt. This curious feature in the outline of the sea-bed is just what would

have been produced by the subsidence of the whole of the southern portion of

the Scandinavian region, together with fifty miles of area around, to a depth of

600 or 700 feet. There are good groimds for supposing that such has been the

process ; and the geological histoiy of the basin seems to supply the precise date of
the subsidence in question.

   As a point in physical geography, it was the depression of the Scandinavian

mass along the line indicated which produced the channels of the Skagerrach

and the Cattegat, and opened a commmiication from the North Sea into the Baltic

depression.

Geologically, some of the later stages or periods of the earth's past history are

so abimdantly illustrated over the East- Anglian area, it is a field in which there

have been so many labourers, as to which, too, there yet remain so many unsolved
points, that I cannot help hoping that this Section will follow to some extent the

example set by their brethren the geologists of France, at then- annual reunions
extraordinaires, and make local geology a prominent subject of their deliberations

at this Meeting.

   The points of interest alluded to belong to the great Kainozoic period ; indeed
it is in this portion of England alone that the complete sequence of change, as it
happened in this country, can be followed out ; and as the term Kainozoic is what

   Wonderful as the progress of research has been during the last fifty years, stiU

the geologist finds himself greatly wanting when he attempts to sketch out in

consecutive order the history of any district, however limited and however simple

it may be. He may know tliat the Nimimiditic period was subsequent to the

Cretaceous, and also that everjnvhere an interval of time has separated them

but he does not know, nor has he any means of ascertaining, how long that inter-

val was and though he may know all                                                                    the  details  of the  successive conditions  of

the thick series of depositions exhibited in the London basin, and have satisfied

himself of the great extension they must once have had beyond their present

area, yet of the process by which so much has been removed he does not Imow

anything, nor of what was being done in any other region of the globe when so

AUmuch was being undone here.                                                              that can be said is, that here, in the south

and east of England, the Nummulitic strata were cut back to a line along which

are now Sudbury, Ipswich, and Yamiouth, and that beyond, on the west and
north, stretched away the bare chalk hills of Suffolk and Norfolk, northwards

still, into the wolds of Lincoln and York.

  For our present outline we need not go further back than this in East-Anglian

Geology ; at the time of the early maiine formations of Kainozoic age the
British-Islands group was united, as a whole, with a broad European-continental

region.

The Kainozoic foiinations of Western Europe have a striking imifonuity in their
--general history those of Spain and Portugal
                                                                       ;                                   next, those of the Bordeaux basin
--and of Touraine, with its Breton dependency finallj^ that of our North-Sea basin,

were all indents from the great Atlantic, and, in all, the character of the fauna is

Atlantic. It is also noteworthj' that in each of these southern and now desiccated
sea-basins the fauna is more southern than that now living in the adjacent seas,

that the fossil moUusca of the Tagus beds present Senegambian relationships, that
so, too, do those of the Lower I3ordeaux beds. The Upper Bordeaux beds are

Southern and Lusitanian in their fauna, as are those of Touraine and Brittany, and

partly so the older Crag of Suffolk, Belgium, and Germany. The southern relations

of these several assemblages gi-ow weaker fi-om south to north, whilst in the North-

Sea basin distribution from anotlier quarter shows itself in the presence of its many

--Transatlantic forms. In this ther^ is evidence of a twofold change First, a set or ex-

tension northwards of a maiine fauna which in its recognized forms is West-Afi-i-

can, afterwards becoming less southern over the same areas; such was the zoolo-

gical change which the lapse of time brought with it. Next, the areas of these for-

mations are first presented as tei-restrial surfaces, then as lateral branches of the

Atlantic, lastly as laid bare again ; and this process seems to have proceeded from
south northwards. The comparison of the whole of the fauna of the Tagus beds with

the whole of that of the Bordeaux basin suggests that the first had been wholly laid

dry before the other had ; so likevrise between the Bordeaux basin and that of

the Loire.

The Crag-sea waters were expelled from the North-Sea area by the rise of the

land on the south of that great bay. The most southern points for the Crag beds
in Belgium ai"e now the highest above the sea-level ; this elevation decreases till
we come to this place, where, if any part of the so-called Norwich Crag or the
fluvio-marine be of that age, such estuary beds must have been then much in the
same position as they are now, or at the sea-level. On evidence such as this, the

North-Sea area, after the period of the earlj' Kainozoic fauna or true Crag, is seen

to be passing again to the condition of terrestrial surface.

This old depression of the North-Sea area, as had the other tertiary basins, again

became part of the general Em-opean land-surface--a nortliern extension of the

Rhine valley                                                                and again the  geologist  meets with    but  little guidance  as  to the
                                                                         ;

district in the area of their life-period is undoubted ; but as to how many of these

coexisted, or to what extent they indicate a successive occupation, is still an un-

decided question.

   The " Forest-bed " of Cromer gives a glimpse of what was the vegetation of this
period ; but here, again, it is more than probable that it must be taken only as the

iacies of the flora of the last stage of terrestrial conditions antecedent to the next
gi'eat physical change, rather than that of the whole period.

  The whole mammalian fauna, from the Norfolk Mastodon to the Mammoth

(Elephas immigenms), seems to ofler itself as an assemblage of the members of
nomad tribes, which have yet to be reduced to order of time. The general condi-

tion of Northern Eiu-ope was ten-estrial for the whole of the tertiary or Kainozoic

period ; dm-ing that time its conditions as to climate passed ii'om warm to tempe-

rate and to arctic. To its close belongs the evidence everywhere recurring, and at

every level, of its subaerial glaciation and greater elevation.

Just as the Crag and Falim beds come in here, on our East-Anglian district

and on the Continent, as breaks in the lapse of tertiai-y ten-estrial conditions, so

the accumulations of the great northern submergence come in as a second intercala-

tion ; only that the physical change in this case was gi-eater and of a different order.
To what this ultimately amounted, is represented on the map of the northern hemi-

sphere*. The arctic basin extended itself as low as to N. lat. 50° by a slow process

of submergence from north to south.

Again the northern hemisphere emerged, apparently, in a contrary direction, or

from south northwards ; again the agencies of ice and snow and excessive rainfall

are exhibited, till again, for its general aiTangement of land and sea, this immediate

district and England generally is presented with the like relations as it had at the

period of the Crag-sea.

The general character and the order of change of the Kainozoic period admit of

being thus briefly told ; but when it is attempted to follow out this change in its

details, it is found to be a long and complicated record.

Over the whole of the European area, as yet less accm-ately traced across the Asi-

atic, very distinct upon the American continent, there is a region which presents

broad expanses of waterworn detritus, sands, and loams, often placed at consi-

derable elevations above present water-levels, which, from their superficial ex-

tent, has caused them to be identified with the component members of another

detrital gi'oup (the glacial di-ift) peculiar to another area, from which they are

distinct as to conditions and mode of accumulation. The conditions indicated

are those of low winter temperatures, terrestrial surfaces with a configuration such

as the same countries have at present, alluvial and fluviatile accumulations, indi-

cative of torrential and periodic rivers.

  A line drawn across the European area, occasionally on one side or other of that

of north lat. 51°, defines the north limit of all this class of detrital accumulations

of the Kainozoic period ; on the south of this all these accumulations have their

limits, and the sources of their materials are within the areas to which belong the

existing river-systems of the South and Mid-Eiu-opean continent.

   North of this line the detrital accumulations are neither local as to composition,

nor have they much reference to surface configuration, although such configuration

preexisted. Over this area, too, are the indications of low temperatures and broad

alluvia. The distribution of the detritus over this area shows that the expanse

water was continuous, and was marine. Over one area are the results of a

general and uniform  submergence                                                      over the  other the  phenomena  are  local  and

alluvial.

 --Over the British and part of the European area there is a good break in Kaino-

zoic time into prreglacial and postglacial, by the term " glacial " being signified

the period of the great extension of the Arctic basin.

This Drift-formation, in one form or another, covers the whole sm-face of this

Wecounty, from the sea-level up to the svmimits of the chalk hills.                                                        have, in

Norfolk, evidence of submergence to the extent of 600 feet and upwards. There

are other parts of this island where the submei-genee exceeded this, even in this

latitude ; so that here the highest land may not be a measure of the greatest

amount of submergence. It was a time when the whole of the British-Islands

group became submerged, with the exception of a few salient points; and, taking

the levels to be derived from these points, together with the general character of

the phenomena, we may accept as certain that subaerial glaciation, in all its varied
modes of action, had long been at work here prior to that submergence. The change

of relative level was not sudden ;  it proceeded from north  southwards                                                and it is in
                                                                                                                    ;

the north that the amoimt of the submergence was the gi-eatest.

The Drift of Norfolk has good illustrations of these several sets of conditions,

and of the manner in which the phenomena of one period have been modified by

conditions which followed. It has been well said that in geological history time

is of no object ; but in a geological address, such as this, it has its claims ; so that

instead of dwelling at any length on the general condition of the British Islands

at the time of their greatest submergence, I have represented on a map of the

northern hemisphere the whole of the area which became submerged, and, for

the pui-^3ose of comparison, there is along with it another, showing the extent of

the Arctic basin at present.

The Drift-accumulations of this county are exceptional in this one respect, that

they attain imusual thicknesses. The Cromer cliff, which is wholly of this forma-
tion, is 270 feet in height : this is not so much an indication of the lapse of time

during the submergence, as the result of position. Situated on the eastern slope

of the English central area, towards the North-Sea depression, during the first

or subaerial stage, the form and slope of the land would favour the transfer

of materials downwards and outwards : in the subsequent stages, the areas of

greater depth would receive the gi-eatest amounts of the abraded spoil of the land-

areas encroached upon. So like-svise during the period of emergence, the transfer

of material would be outwards. The most reasonable explanation of the present
shallow condition of the North Sea, as compared with its depths when occupied

by the Crag sea, is, that it has been filled by the aggregate of the accumulations of

the Drift-period.

   The former extent of the Scandinavian region is of interest to the British

--geologist during several periods during the glacial period, from the spoil that was

drifted from it and scattered over our ea.stem counties.

  From early times this region was in the condition of dry land. No beds of the

age of the Crag have been met vrith on its surface ; the absence of this formation,
which occurs on the coast of Denmark, suggests that the land of Norway then stood

at a higher relative level. That this was so is indicated by the manner and extent

to which the surface is scored by glacial action, not only down to the present sea-

level, but far below it. The deep fiords were occupied by glaciers ; they passed

over the numerous islands off that coast, which, too, are all scored.

The submarine trough which contours Norway must ha-^e been produced subse-

quently to this greater elevation of the region. The Crag-sea coincided with part

of that period of elevation ; and its marginal beds in that quarter lay some fafty
miles or more from the Norwegian coast-lme. The subsequent depression amounted

to more than the depth of the trough, inasmuch as around the upper end of the

Gulf of Christiania there occur marine beds at elevations of 600 feet above the sea,

indicating a total change of level of at least 1200 feet.

Whatever the amount of this former elevation of the Scandinavian land and the

precise period of its glaciation may have been, the geological phenomena about

Christiania, so carefully described by the naturalist M. Sars, show clearly that the
whole has also been much below its present level. The phenomena, as a whole,

correspond with what took place over our area, but they are so much more definite

that they deserve brief notice as part of the physical history of the North-Sea basin.

From an elevation of 500 feet down to 300 feet there is a succession of marginal sea-

lines, with banks of littoral and sublittoral shells (SkJ£Blbanker). These have also

their deeper water-beds and shells (Mergelleret). These successive lines show that

the rise of the land through the 200 feet in question was at intervals.

   The marine fauna of this higher sea-level is given first in its littoral, and next in

--its deeper-water facies. Taken together, we have this result that all the species

are now living, that it is an Arctic-basin assemblage, and not at all that of the

neighbouring seas. This is the "glacial-formation series.

    Below tlie 800-feet leTel there occurs a belt or interval 150 feet broad, over which
 " shell-banks " are not niet with, below which a second series occurs. The sliella

 contained in these beds differ from those of the higher series in being less arctic.

 Certain of these characteristic forms have disappeared, numerous boreal shells have
made their appearance, together with forms of the Lusilanian region. Altogether

 this marine fauna approximates to that of the neighbouring seas, only that some
members of the earlier or more arctic series linger on.

    The subdivision of the Eaat-Anglian Kainozoic series is aa follows :

    A. Prseglacial; B. Glacial j C. Postglacial.

    Crag, in Suffolk, is a local agricultural name for any sandy, gi-avelly soil ; but

the early geologists and shell-collectors soon found that it was something more
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

its very perfect shells were recognized as in part agreeing with those of the neigh-
bouring seas, in part as unknown or foreign. Mr. S. Woodward, in his ' Outline

of the Geology of Norfolk,' 1833, has a detailed account of this formation. His

own views are admirable ; the range of the Crag formation, as he gives it, from
Cromer, by Norwich, to the Suffolk coast is nearly exact. Nor did the estuarian

character of the formation about Norwich escape him. Apart from this local
condition, he considered the Norfolk and Suffolk beds to be " decidedly contem-

poraneous."

    It was not till 1835 that a subdivision of the Crag was proposed by Mr.
Charlesworth ; and it was amended (in 1838) by the following classification :

   4. Upper Crag of Norfolk and Suffolk
   5. Red Crag.

    6. Coralline Crag.

    Thus far back Mr. Cbariesworth separated the Norwich Crag from that of
Suffolk. The Eed Crag at Tattingstone, RanLsholt, and Sudbourne was said to
overlie a worn and uneven surface of the white or coralline ; from this consideration

their relative dates or ages n'as inferred. This nominal subdivision may be said
to have been adopted from that time onwards down nearly to the present.

    The Bryvzoan Crag overlies London clay, and is under 20 feet thick. It is a
good division, because it is an indication of a definite range of depths, where the
sea-bed was not within reach of surface disturbance, yet where the drifting power
was considerable, and having its own proper fauna, of which the Bryozoa form a
very large proportion. The examples of this condition of sea-bed occur only in
Suffolk, where they are now about 40 feet above the sea-level. Assigning to these
beds depths of 40 fathoms, a difference of 300 feet is the least that can be assumed
as that of their original, compared vsdth their present positions. It is the lowest
condition, or the deepest, of which ovx English area offers any illustration. It does
not occur over any part of Belgium, where the lowest beds above the sea-level

belong to the deep-sea deposits of ooze, or to the 100 fathoms depth.

   The Red Crag, though a good division for the time when it was proposed, is a
complex assemblage, in spite of its small vertical dimensions. Of all that was
originally so grouped, a very smaUportion only (that of one locality) can now be
referred to as such, namely, the Crag at Walton Naze ; in this alone is to be
found an old sea-bed, a marine-life zone, undistui-bed since its original accumu-

lation.

   The Red-Crag beds of the valleys of the Stour, OrweU, and Deben, though re-
ferable to some part of the same general period, are wholly rean-anged or remanU
beds and of the later stages of the Crag-sea ; they are, relatively to the Walton
beds, very shallow-water accumulations, presenting that diagonal mode of accumu-
lation in varying directions indicative of surface disturbance and tidal movements.
Above them, in places, and on the land side of them, are certain thick accumula-
tions of red coarse sands, which have also been refei-red to the Red Crag, and
which atone time I supposed to represent a more marginal sea-zone, the'' ordi-
nary Red Crag being that condition of sea-bed known as dead- shell sand and
gravel. The shell-gravel of Antwei-j) corresponds with the Red Crag of Suffolk.

   Additions were subse(juently made, as in the case of the Chillesford Crag "of
Prestwich, and the Bridhngton Crag.
56 EEPORT-- 1868.

    The Norwich, orjluvio- marine Crag, the uppermost of Mr. Charlesworth's classi-

fication, was for many years the subject of difl'erences of opinion, as to its value and
distinctness as a division ; it had also gi'adually been made to include much more
than at first : any bed containing either mammalian and molluscan remains, or even
an admixtm-e of fresh- and salt-water moUusca, in any part of Suffolk and Norfolk,
had come to be put down as the equivalent of the Norwich Crag.

   General opinion seems now to have come round to the view which some geolo-

gists had long since taken. Writing in 1865, Mr. Searles "Wood states, " the Noi-wich
Crag is not geologically distinct from the Red, but a fluvio-marine condition of

the same period." He establishes this in an analysis of the molluscous fauna, such

as leaves little doubt as to this point ; and the only criticism which is suggested

--is may it not have been an equivalent of the whole Crag period F and may not the

Yar valley have been a tributary to the Crag Sea, dui-ing its whole duration as

such ?

   In Suffolk, the fluvio-marine accumulations at Thorpe, near Aldborough, Wang-
ford, and Biilcham, are considered by Mr. S. Wood to be of the same age as that

of Norwich.
    The Forest-bed of Cromer (1824), and some other places, to which Mr. R. C.

Taylor first called attention, and to which he assigned its true age and position, is

one of the most interesting points in Norfolk geology ; it is the immistakeable indi-
cation of a ten-estrial sm'face, antecedent to the period of the " glacial-drift " accu-

mulations. This old land-surface, at Cromer, is exposed at the sea-level ; but it

extends inland, and has been met with at considerable depths in the offing.

 --The arboreal vegetation buried in these beds compnses the Norway spruce,

Scotch fii', yew, oak, alder, all of them common North -European trees.
   What the Cromer coast-section demonstrates is, that by process of change

of level a forestial condition of the surface had been brought down to the sea-
margin, that the trees had died, and that mud-deposits had formed, partly imder

fresii, partly under brackish water lagoons.
   Subjacent to the " Forest-bed," and coveiing the surface of the Chalk, is a layer

of chalk flints; a like accumulation is seen resting on the Chalk in numerous

other places, as in the sections below this city (Holy Cross, Thoi-pe, &c.), and are
all referable to the same agency and period. The flints have been dissolved out of the

chalk by the action of rain-water, and left in situ ; they indicate a long period of
subaerial conditions ; and their formation is coextensive with the whole duration
of those conditions ; they are therefore of the same period as the " Forest-bed." All

collectors and observers seem now to be agreed upon this, that the Cromer mam-

malian remains are referable to this particular surface.

                        B. Glacial.

More recently the Norwich sections have been subjected to a closer examina-

tion ; and according to INIi-. J. E. Taylor (1867) these admit of a twofold division :

the iipper is a coarse and rubbly accumulation, with well-rounded pebbles of
Aflint ; the lower consists of finer sands.
                                             band of white cross-bedded sand inter-

venes. Such a change in the character of successive beds would not, by itself,

have been of much importance ; but zoologically the differences they pi-esent are

much more significant.

The fresh- and brackish-water forms, which long since gave the Norwich Crag

its fliuio-marine character, occiu' only in the lower division ; in this, too, the pro-

portion of littoral species of marine shells is gi-eater ; and here also are found ail

those fonns which are supposed to be extinct.

The upper division has its peculiar forms, such as Mwliola modiolus, Astarte

comjn-essa, A. sulcata, A. elliptica. Other shells are more abundant which in the

--lower are scarce ; here they occur as if in their " life-zone," instead of as single

valves, worn and broken such as Tellina ohliqua, Astarte horealis, Venus fasciata,

Cardium Gramlandicum, Cyprina Islandica, IthynchoneUa jysittacea.

It is only in respect of one shell (Tellina obliqua) that the forms of the upper

division have not  been recognized as  living                               and with respect  to  distribution, the
                                                                         ;

northern fades of the upper assemblage is more strongly marked than that of the

lower lastly, they indicate a somewhat gi'eater depth of water.

   Chillesford Crag. In 1849, Mr. Prestwich made known some marine beds in

the parishes of Iken and Chillesford, either yellow sands or laminated micaceous

clays. At Iken these beds are supei-posed upon a worn sm-face of the older or

Bryozoan Crag. There is no such direct evidence as to their relation to the Red

Crag ; but there is no doubt that they are unconformable to both divisions.

These beds are in striking contrast to the ti-ue Crag, in respect of their com-

position and the condition of the shells they contain ; they were tranquil depositions,

the bivalves at every place constantly exhibiting the two shells in contact, and in

--the positions in which the animals had lived. With respect to this faima, 2.3

species only were met with i Gasteropods and 19 Acephala. Mr. S. Wood re-

cognized the Arctic character of the assemblage, and considered the beds poste-

rior to the Red Crag, probably the equivalents of the Norwich. The agi'eement

with the Bridlington Crag was not very close, there being only six or seven species

in common.

   Differences of opinion as to detail, both of facts and inferences, might be cited,

as is well-known to those geologists who have attended to this very complicated
portion of the geological record ; but thus much seems to have been ascertained,
that the so-called Chillesford Crag is rather a subordinate member of the marine
glacial period than an upper member of the Crag, and that it is referable to a time
when the climatal conditions, as indicated by the marine mollusca, had undergone

a great change.

Bridlington Crag was a name given to a set of marine clay-beds occurring at

that place, about 30 feet thick ; they overlie an accumulation of chalk flints derived

fi'om the subjacent chalk.

   Mr. S. Wood, in his Monoo-raph, included these beds in the Crag, and considered

them the equivalents of the Norwich Crag (1855).

  I am not aware that the faiina of these beds attracted any pai-ticular attention
till Mr. S. P. Woodward prepared his general list of the Norwich-Crag accumula-

tions for Mr. Gunn's essay. In 1864 he undertook a fresh examination, not from

lists, as before, but from original specimens fi-om Mr. Bean's and Mr. I^eckenby's

collections ; this led him to the unexpected result that the Bridlington Crag coidd
no longer be considered an equivalent of the Norwich Crag. The list of marine

testacea had been increased to 64 (or by more than 20) ; of these, 3-5 are met
with in the Norwich Crag, whilst 29 species (or one-half) are now living in seas

north of Biitain, the proportion of Ai'ctic shells in the Norwich Crag being only

one-sixth.

   Mr. Woodward next compared the Bridlington fauna with that of the Clyde

beds belonging to the close of the " glacial period," and with this residt, that they

differed very nearly as much from these as they did from the Norwich assemblage

they must therefore be separated from the Crag series.
   The Bridlington testacea are more indicative of Arctic climatal conditions than

any assemblage in or about the British Islands. As an assemblage, it is wholly
recent and living, and marks a stage in the northern submergence dming the
glacial period, when the ^^'ctic-basin marine fauna had extended itself over our

seas.

for the Royal Agricultural Society (1847), it was the adoption of a theory gui-

ding his observations that enabled him to disentangle and harmonize all that mass

of confused materials (Drift) which till then had so perplexed him ; " each part then

soon fell into its appropriate place." In this case, fortunately, the adopted theory

was right, namely, submergence and emergence--that the accumulations of the

erratic group indicate a long period of accumulation over a ten-estrial surface,

--followed by denudation as it rose again. For the whole of the period and its pro-

ducts, he proposed two groups of Drift a lower and an upper. He seems to me to

have recognized certain distinctive characters in the Lower Drift, which are the

indications of the different conditions of accmnulatiou concerned, such as " the

masses of fragmentary chalk, with little or no admixture of other matter," "angu-

lar fragments, very slightly water-worn," and, on the other hand, the " detritus

from  gi-eater  distances  ;    the transfer  of this  chalk  material  in  the  direction  of  Cro-

                             "

mer had not escaped him.

Mr. Searles Wood, jun., had proposed for the "Drift or Glacial" series of the

upper Kainozoic period an upper and a lower; he subsequently subdivided the

lower, whence resulted :

      1. Upper Drift, or Boulder-clay, maximum thickness. . . .                  feet.
      2. Middle Drift, maximum thickness
                                                                                 160+
      3. Lower Drift (Tjoulder, till, and contorted beds of Cromer)
                                                                                  70

                                                                                 150+

   The Lower Drift immediately overlies the Chalk, except near this place, where it
has what has been designated as the " Norwich Crag " at its base, the inland
facies of this division being a mass of merely remani^ chalk rubble, without

any admixture of other materials ; this facies does not extend east of Norvdch.
Beyond and on to the coast the Lower Drift is of sand; above, on the coast
section, is a blue till with boulders, horizontally bedded, passing up into very con-
torted beds. Tliese lower sands west of Cromer contain the debris of the under-

lying Lignite beds. In the case of the inland, as of the coast-line facies, the

character of the accumulation is immediately dependent on the subjacent beds.

When we bear in mind that previously to the accumulation of this Drift-series
the boimdary line of the Nummulitic formation by Sudbmy and Ipswich had

been well defined, and consequently that High Suffolk and Norfolk presented a
range of bare chalk hills, we are prepared to adopt the supposition of Mr. S.
Wood, jun., and refer this division of the series to the agencies of subaerial

glaciatioiL

                                0. Postglacial.

   In the Nar valley, which joins the Ouse at Lynn, is met with a well-known set

of marine depositions of this age. They extend some nine miles along its course,

--and occupied what must have been a creek at the time when the whole of the Bed-

ford level was sea an inland extension of the Wash. Mr. Rose called attention to

this stage of the Kainozoic series in 1836, and assigned it to its true position. This

deposit, which is 40 feet in thickness and 60 above the present sea-level, contains

27 species of testacea, all of which are also North-Sea shells.
   These subjects have engaged many speculative and ingenious minds, from the

--middle of the last century, down to those now actively at work here such as

Arderen, WiUiam Smith the father of Geology, the Taylors, Robberds, the
Woodwards (of whom four generations), Clarke, Mitchell, Trimmer^ Gimn, Osmond
Fisher. But I should be wanting to the place in which we are now met, wholly

imworthy to fill this chair, wanting to the great subject which assembles so

many here, wholly forgetful of my own obligations, if I were not mindful that

fessor the Rev. Canon Sedgwick.

Ifotes on the Fossils from the Old Red Sandstone of KiJtorcan HiU, County

            Kilkenny. By Wm. Helliek Bailt, F.L.S., F.G.S., ^y.

  With reference to the plant-remains. Dr. W. P. Schimpor has communicated to
me some important information. He remarks that the fructified leaves of Cyclo-

pteris Hibernica slio-w' that this fossil fern belongs to the family of Hymenophyllse,

forming a peculiar genus, to which he gives the name of JEopteris.
   The species of Sagenaria he names S. Baibjana. In the fruit of this species,

which differs from <S'. Veltheimiana , the scales are exti-emelj long, and nearly suhu-

lated. On some specimens very large and distinct sporuJes were arranged at the

bases of the scales ; this he considered very remarkable, as no other species, of
which the fruit is known, have such large sporules, a proof, as he remarks, of
inferiority of the plant, probably the oldest of the genus.

    In the last collection of fossils made at this place by myself and the fossil-col-

lectors of the Geological Survey, parts of a crustacean, including the chelae or
pincers, were obtained, presenting clear evidence of the existence of Pterygotus

amongst this assemblage. This species I propose to name P. Hibernicus. The
discovery of these characteristic portions of a genus, which appears to have pre-
ceded Em-yptenis, is of considerable importance, both stratigi-aphically and as serv-
ing to explain the more exact relationship of specimens foimerly obtained from
this place, and doubtfully referred to the latter genus, but which will, I believe,

be found to be identical with P. Hibernicus.

    The fish-remains hitherto discovered are, for the most part, in the condition of
detached bones and plates or scales, and are therefore necessarily difficult of deter-
mination. Ghjptolejns and Coccosieus are the prevailing forms ; there are othei-s,
however, which require study and additional specimens for their elucidation.
It is hoped therefore that fm'ther explorations at this important fossil locality will
thi'ow considerable light upon the fossils of the Old Red Sandstone.

         On the Molhiscan Fauna of the Red Crag. By Alfred Bell,

   The results of a critical comparison of the shells of the different crags are con-
sidered by the author to justify hiin in the following conclusions :

   That the series of deposits constituting the Red Crag proper commences at
Walton-on-the-Naze, and does not extend further north than Chillesford, where it

appears as the base-bed of the pit under the church.

   That the molluscan fauna contained in this area Hved in the Red Crag seas, and

are tiot derived from the debris of an older foimation (except in a very few cases).
   That the beds containing these shells were deposited in quiet waters, and
   That the propoi-tion of recent forms is about 65 per cent, (exclusive of land and

freshwater shells).

   In support of these propositions it is shown that the lowest Red Crag deposits,

i. e. those at Waldringfield and Walton-on-the-Naze, while the nearest in their
relations to the preceding formation, containing such characteristic Coralline Crag
shells as Gastroma laminosa, Artemis lincta, Cardium decorticatum, Voluta Lamherti,

Fustis consocialis and alveolatus, Terebra inversa, EuUma polita, Cerithium inver-

sum, Pyramidella Iceviuscukt, and others, are marked by the introduction of at least
fifty new forms.

   Of the 400 species found in the Coralline, not more than about half range upwards to
the Red Crag, and the gi-eatest diversity in their respective faunae obtains where, as
at Ramsholt and Sutton, the two formations are seen in juxtaposition. The small
solid Pyramidella may serve for an exainple. Abundant in the White Crag at
Sutton, it is altogether absent in the Red Crag at the same place.

   The following short list will suffice to show the difference in the characteristic
shells in the older and newer Red Crags, most of the abundant forms of the lower
beds (Coralline Crag and earlier Red) being altogether absent, or but sparely
represented in the upper horizon, and also the reverse.

having yielded to the author Piqm marginata (2), Planorhis complanatus (2),
Limnmus pereger (1), truncattdus (1), and an imfigured? form.

   The quiescent nature of the Red Crag- seas may be judged from the exquisite
state in vrhich every species (not specimen) may be obtained, and the number of

perfect bivalves to be obtained in situ, as Terebratula, Mytilus, Cardium angusta-
tmn, and edide, Astarte, Gastrana, Solen, Mactra, and Pholas.

  A list of all the species of Red Crag shells known was appended to the paper.

             Recent Geological Changes on the British Islands.

             By the Rev. James Beodie (Monimail, Fifeshire).

In this paper the author arranged his observations and conclusions under the

following propositions :

    1. There has been no elevation of the coasts of Britain in consequence of subter~

--ranean agency since the time of the Roman occupation. St. IMichael's Mount in

Cornwall is now, as it was in the time of the Greek historian, an island at high

water, and a peninsula at the ebb. The remains of Roman buildings, roads,

embankments, and fortifications which have been discovered in Kent, in Norfolk,

in I^incolnshire, in the valley of the Forth in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh,

and of Stirling, and on the other side of the island in the valley of the Clyde in

Lanarkshire, show that the level of the sea and land, at the time when they were

formed, was the same as it is at present. On the north-east coast of Scotland,

rude sculptures on rocks, kitchen middens, and other traces of the prehistoric

races who were contemporary with the Romans, are found in such situations as

show that there has been no alteration of the coast-level since they were formed.

We therefore conclude that there has been no elevation of the coast of Britain,

either sudden or gradual, since the Roman occupation.

 --2. Hie last elevation of the Scottish coast was sudden. In the A^alley of the

Forth, near Stirling, several skeletons of whales have been foimd imbedded in a

bed of clayey loam, which is from 15 to 20 feet in thickness. The bones are so

entire, and lie in such regular position, as clearly to prove that they must have

been enveloped in the clay that suiTounds them, while the ligaments that bound

them together were still entire. They cannot have been exposed for any length

of time to the action either of the water or of the air. If the elevation of the

coast had been slow and gi-adual, as soon as the bed of loam came to be exposed to

the action of the wind and wave, it woidd have been washed away, and the skeletons

thus left xmprotected, the bones would have been weather-beaten, broken, and
Ascattered.
             similar argamient may be employed in regard to some shell-beds

which have been foimd in the same neighbourhood. These beds lie sometimes in

loam, sometimes in sand. They are from 5 to 15 feet above high-water mark.

The shells are numerous, and remain in the same position they occupied when the

animals they contained were alive. In the valley of the Clyde, near Glasgow,

similar beds of shells are found. In that quarter also a number of ancient vessels

have been found imbedded in loam. Some of them were 20 feet above high-

water mark. These vessels evidently owe theii' presen-ation, like the Stirling

skeletons, to the clay that sun'ounded them, and we conclude that, like them,

they must have been suddenly elevated.

 --3. Tlie extent of this elevation teas hetiveoi 30 and 40 feet. The surface of the

bed of clay in which the skeletons are imbedded, in its higher parts, is 28 feet

above ordinary high-water mark. As that surface nnist have formed the bottom

of the estuary before the elevation took place, we cannot estimate its amount at

loss than 30 or 40 feet.

  --4. This elevation took place some two thousand gears ago. Among the vessels
                TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.            61

found in the valley of the Clyde there were two which were artistically con-

Westructed, and had the appearance of ancient galleys. In one of the vessels was a
plug of cork.   may_ therefore conjecture that these were trading-vessels from

some of the Carthagenian settlements in Spain ; and we are led to suppose that

the date of the catastrophe that destroyed them was some centimes Ijefore the

Christian era.

   There are indications that some time previous to this elevation the coast of
Scotland must have been subject to earthquake tremors, like those that recently
occurred at Tortola in the West Indies, but of greater violence and extent. There
are also evidences of a succession of elevations and depressions of a remarkable
kind that must have prcAiously taken place.

   Jmie the coasts of Britain exhibit no trace of subterranean agency since the time
of the Roman occupation, previous to that date they must have' been subject to very

violent and extensive conmdsions.

On the Western Asia Minor Coal and Iron Basins, and on the Geology of the

                            District. By Dr. Hyde Clakke.

   The author describes the extensions of the basins first discovered by him, and
which includes an area of 120 miles by 120, extending over the disti-icts of the
Maeander and Ilermus. Dr. Clarke, refen-ing to his former obsen-ations on the
extension of mica-schist across the Bosphorus into Europe, suggests the possible
connexion of the Hurbklea coal-mines and the Asiatic shore of the Black Sea and
the lignite formations on the European shore. The latest discoveries in the main
basin are of coal at Birdik in the upper course of the Masander, and that at

Kayejik in the district of Chiordes, illustrating the easterly extension. Dr. Clarke
expresses his firm conviction that this old gold district of Pactolus will be found a
productive field.

On the Skeleton of a Fossil Whale recently exhumed on the Eastern Coast of

                         Suffolk. By Edwards Ceisp, M.D.

   The skeleton of this whale (the first perfect skeleton found in England) had
recently been exhumed by the author ; it was found in the Chillesford clay about

10 feet below the sm-face. It was 31 feet in length ; measurements, drawings

and models of all the bones, as they were zw situ, were taken. Many of the bones

the vertebras especially, were so soft that they fell to pieces on rernoval ; but the
whole skeleton, the author said, could readily be partly restored by means of the
clay models and plaster casts.

Dr. Crisp had examined and measured all the skeletons of modem whales in the

British Museum, and in the Museum of the College of Surgeons, and he came to
Athe conclusion that this was a new species of Balcsna.
                                                         careful comparison had

been made of the tympanic bones of this whale, and the same bones of many

fossil and modern whales, and they differed from all at present examined. Fossil
shells, impressions of shells, and fishes' bones were found in the clay around the
skeleton. Very careful investigations were needed, and much work had to be

done, the author said, before accurate conclusions could be arrived at. The paper

was illustrated by numerous drawings ; and some of the vertebrae, portions of the

ribs, and the tympanic bones were exhibited.

On the Parallelism of the Cretaceous Strata of England and the North of France
   with those of the West, South- West, and South of France and the North of

   Africa. By Prof. Henri Coquand, of Marseilles. Translated by John
   WiCKHAM Flower.

    In this paper the author observes that the divisions of the Cretaceous beds
which were originally established by English geologists, and which have been
generally accepted on the continent of Europe, are, in fact, altogether insufficient
in a great measure, and inapplicable as regards any other district than England

and the north of France. Thus, for example, as we approach the west of France
                                                                                                                               ;

extensive beds of limestone and sandstone, characterized by Ostrea hiaurimlata
(and which are entirely wanting in England and the north of France), known as
the Grhs du Mans, are found interposed between the base of the Lower Chalk and

the highest beds of Chalk-marl.

   Proceeding towards the Pyrenean basin more important modifications occur.
The Grks du Mans is much more largely developed, and comprises a gi-eat abun-
dance of Etidistes. Above this layer are foimd the marly beds of the Lower Chalk

and above these again, the Angoumie)i, Mornasien, and Provencien strata, equivalent

together to a thickness of 2000 feet.

In the basin of the Loire another horizon is found, which, in its turn, supports a

solid  limestone  abounding  in  other  species  of Rudistes                                              and with  this, the  Craie
                                                                                                       ;

moyenne of the south-west and south of France terminates.

The author then proceeds to describe the Upper Chalk as composed of four dis-

tinct layers, each characterized by a distinct fauna, and neither of which are met

with in England or in the basin of the Seine. Li the west of Provence these beds
are largely developed ; and M. Coquand has given diagrams and lists of the charac-

teristic fossils, which seem to diiFer essentially from those found in similar beds

elsewhere.

M. Coquand then gives a description of the Upper Chalk of Provence, dividing

it into Coniacien (ferruginous limestone), Santonien (of which the upper portion is
fluviatile), and Campanmi and Dordonien, both consisting of freshwater limestone,

with eighteen distinct beds of lignite, and attaining a thickness of from 1500 to
1800 feet. The Campanien and the upper part of the Santonien furnish large

quantities of coal ; and, indeed, Marseilles and the surrounding district are entirely
dependent upon these beds for their supply of this mineral.

   The cretaceous beds of Algeria are next described, and their coiTespondence, as
regards their faima and position, with the Provenfal strata before described is
shown ; and after obsei-ving that by a comparison of Algeria with Provence, Pro-

vence with Charente, Charente with Sarthe, Sarthe with Paris, and Paris with

England, we shall be able to recognize the various links of the Cretaceous system,

M. Coquand suggests that the divisions hitherto recognized by English geologists

are altogether inadequate to indicate the true character of the chalk, and that if a

general classification of these strata were now to be established, the preference

ought to be given to Provence, on account of the facility of finding those divisions

larger and more numerous, and, in short, presenting more classical types.

       On the Formation of certain Columnar Structures. By J. Cuekt.

                                 On the Oenus Clisiophyllum.
            By Dr. P. Maetin Duncan, FM.S., F. and Sec. Geol. Soc.

   Great numbers of specimens of several species of this genus abound in the
Lower Cai-boniferous limestone of the Scottish coal-field at Beith, Ayi-shire, Les-
mahagow, Lanarkshire, Bathgate, Linlithgowshire.

   Mr. J. Thomson, of Glasgow, whose photographs of sections of Carboniferous

Corals were exhibited at the last Meeting of the Association, has forwarded me

about 200 fine specimens, carefully cut in sections, and in excellent order.

  A careful examination of these has enabled me to arrive at the following con-

--clusions : Dana, the great American zoophytologist, originated the genus, and

M'Coy, following Dana, gave new species of it to science, and had sections of his
types lithographed in Sedgwick's celebrated work on the Palaeozoic fossils.

   Milne-Edwards and Jules Haimes retained Dana's name Clisiojjhj/lium in their

description of the genus in the Introd. Pal. Soc, in their Des. des Pol. des Ten-ains
Palaeoz., and in their Hist. Nat. des Corall. But they have added a most im-
portant structural peculiarity to the genus. Doubtless they had better specimens
than Dana and M'Coy; for nothing can be more evident than the existence in the

axis of the corals of the genus of a gi'eat lamella, ending at the bottom of the
calice in a prominent ridge. The ridge was noticed by the previous authors, but not
the lamella. Yet this lamella determines the peculiar construction of the central
parts of the coral. M'Coy. in the description of one of his species, says that a

large septum exists across the central area, but in another place, and in his draw-

ings there is nothing of the kind.

   Those palcBontologists who study from M'Coy are therefore at a very great dis-

adyantage. The correctness of the views of Milne-Edwards and Jules Haimes is
beyond a doubt, and Clisiophyllum of Ed. and H. is thus readily separable from
the closely callied genera AulophyUum and CyclophyUum. The genus is interesting,

because the apparent prolongations of the septa over the central boss to the colu-

mella are indications of the pali which abound in many Mesozoic genera, and also
because it is closely allied, from its minute structure, with the well-known com-
pound forms of Lonsdaleia and Lithostrotioti. This alliance was asserted by Dana.
The specimens prove that, although they may be arbitrarily divided into three

species, still the gi-adation of structiu'e between the types of these species is per-
fectly shown in some of the nimierous examples. Moreover, the vaiiation in some
of the structm-es, which are generally considered sufficiently stable to be safe
guides in species-making, is immense. In fact no better proof can be given that a

species is the sum of a greater or less amount of vai-iatiou, instead of a lixed and
definite matter, than that afforded by these Scottish corals.

   The specific differentiation must be decided, not by the shape, or size, or septal
number of the corals, but by the size of the central area, the obliquity, straightness,
and quantity of the endotheca generally, and the number and direction of the

septa which cover the centi-al area.

            On the Denudations of Norfolk. By the Rev. 0. Fishek.

   The author first called attention to the denudations upon the land surface,
stating that a certain amount of the fine material was being canied into the rivers,
and by them deposited at the heads of the broads or in the sea. This denudation by
pluvial action was undoubtedly gi'eater where the land was under the plough
than it would be otherwise. Upon the coast the sea was reducing the solid surface
to a uniform level. Where the land was high it cut away the bottoms of the
cliffs, which then foimdered down, and the fallen matter was in its turn carried off;
and where it was low the general contour of the coast was being continued by sand
dunes or " MaiTam Hills ; " so that where the end of a valley was submerged, its
bottom was being raised seaward, and reduced to a uniform level and continuous
coast-line. But when the waves had played their part, the action of the sea was
not ended. As the sea cut further into the land, the ground laid under water became
subject to the action of tides, so as to be kept, on the whole, at a uniform depth
for a given distance from land. If the waste of the shore was prevented by arti-
ficial means, the sea was foimd to deepen rapidly, and the inclination of the bottom
from the shore to be increased. This marine action, if considered, did not appear
possible to give rise to any very great inequality of surface, but, on the other hand,
it must tend to reduce those already existing.

   AU great inequalities of the sea-bottom must either have been caused by the

land having become submerged more rapidly than the sea had time to move its
coast-line, or else by elevations and depressions taking place beneath the ocean,
or, in a few instances, by powerful currents confined by local circumstances to a
narrow course. Since the tides deepen the sea below the level to which the waves
act upon the coast, it must follow that the harder rocks must be lowered more slowly
than softer ones, and shoals be formed. It was to such a denudation as that just
described that the form of the surface of this county might be supposed to be due
at the period preceding the deposition of the Crag. It might be safely supposed
that the sea-bottom at the period of the Crag consisted of a shoal bottom of chalk,
nearly level on the eastern side of our area, while the same stratum rose as dry
land to a considerable elevation towards its central and western portions. But
there was no distinct indication of the position and ancient coast-line of the Crag

sea, though, no doubt, it extended further inland than Norwich, Horstead, and
Coltishall ; indeed the author saw no reason to doubt that the remnants of ferru-

ginous shelly travel adhering to the surface of the chalk on the beach at Lower
Sherringham oelong to it. The appearance of the chalk at Bungay and of the
Upper Norwich Crag at Aldeby, near Beccles, would place the junction of the two
deposits somewhere between Beccles and Bungay.
--64 REPORT 1868.

   There were no data for determining the coast-line of the Crag, but it was pro-
bably a line of cliffs extending in a direction somewhat paralled with the present

eastern coast of Norfolk, and about twenty miles westward of it. At Yarmouth,
where the London clay covered up the chalk, a different condition of things must

have obtained. Indeed, in eai'ly postcretaceous times, there seems to have been a

depression of erosion in course of the valley of the Waveney and the Little

Ouse. There is no e\'idence that the sea of the Crag period occupied any part of
the present estuary of the Wash. It is probable, on the other hand, that the
chalk must have extended considerably to the westward of its present escarpment.

   Immediately upon the chalk at Thorpe, where the Crag rests upon it, is a thick
bed of angular flints, which appears to be the accumulated residt of the removal of
the chalk intervening between several successive layers. It is amongst these
flints that numerous bones, teeth, and tusks of Mastodon and Elephas meridionalis
and other mammalia occur. The author's opinion was that the chalk to which these
flints are due was removed by the erosion of currents, which were not strong enough
to remove the flints. To accoimt for the bones found amongst these flints there
was the alternative that the chalk formed a land surface on which bones were left,
the flints being accounted for by subaerial solution of the chalk. After discussing the
difficulties which this supposition raised, he proceeded to consider the succession

of events subsequent to the period of the Crag. As to the Chillesford clay, the
author recanted his formerly published \dew (refeiTed to by the President of the

Section), and added that, although he agreed with Messrs. Wood regarding the

sequence downwards from the Chillesford clay to the Crag, whether red or fluvio-
niarine, he did not think that its position relative to the Forest-bed and glacial
series above was yet satisfactorily made out, and expressed an opinion, rendered
probable by the occurrence of whales' bones in both, that it might be identical
with the soil in which the preglacial Forest-bed was rooted.

   The author then traced the course of events until the close of the glacial period,
adopting Mr. S. V. Wood, jun.'s views of their division into " Lower," " Middle,"

and " Upper Drift." He showed that the contortions in the lower drift were chiefly

due to the precipitation of large masses of gi-avel, chalk, &c. upon a soft bottom, and
proved that Mr. Trimmer's supposition of the sinking of blocks of ice was a neces-
sary result of the thawing of masses containing a portion of earthy matter ; and he
explained the anomalous position of patches of shelly gravels, containing abun-
dance of Tellina solidida, by supposing them portions of frozen beach deposited un-

thawed at the bottom of the sea.
   The author subsequently referred to the denudations by which the present con-

tour of the surface has been formed. He thought that we must look to the action

of the sea for the removal of the greater part of the strata which have disappeared,
but to subaerial action for the present contour ; and, referring to his published
views, attributed the latter to the action of land-ice. To this he considered due

the peculiar distm-bed condition of the flrst three or foui' feet of almost every sec-
tion, and the furrows often extending to more than twice that depth, filled with

materials from higher ground in rear. He adduced also the recurved edges of

vertical slate-beds, to be met with even on level ground, as evidences of the same

 action.

    The aiithor then remarked upon some of the peculiarities of the surface-contour
 of Norfolk, especially its Broads and Meres, and suggested that they had probably
 a glacial origin, and arose from the occupation of the surface hereabout by ice at a
later date than in other parts of England, as now the January Isothermal of 32° F.
 approaches nearest to this part of England. It must be premised that a low mean

 temperature is necessaiy for the production of land-ice, although not for floating

ice, which is carried by currents into temperate regions. He likewise attempted
 to explain the remarkable flat valley occupying the watershed at Lopham Ford

 by glacial denudation.

         On tJie ShuU and Bones of an Jguanodon. By the Rev. W. Fox.

    The object of this paper was to show that the author has discovered a new

 species of Iguanodon. In proof of this he exhibited a skull, which, from the cha-
 racter of its teeth, there could be no doubt belonged to an Iguanodon. The skull,
                                                                                    TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                 65

he argued, was too small to belong e^'oii to the newly hatched young of the species

/. MunteUi. Besides this, the skull showed that his new species had teeth in the

front of the luouth of a conical and prehensile character, which the well-known

species has not. The author further stated that he has discovered several other

almost perfect skeletons of Iguanodons similar in size to that to which the small

skull belonged                                                                      and that all these  remains  came  from  different  parts of  one and
                                                                                 ;

the same bed iu the Wealden formation near Brixton, in the Isle of "Wight. The

ntimber of these small specimens, unmixed, as it seems they were, by bones of

larger individuals, he assigns as another reason for regarding these bones as indica-

tive of a new species. It appears also that this new species had four toes in the
hind foot, whereas (if Owen has made no mistake) the large Iguauodon had but

three. Again, the new species, if it bo such, has its iliac bones much more ex-

panded and bird-like than the same bones in /. ManieUi. And lastly, the author

argued that the bones of these small specimens cannot have belonged to the young

of the I(/uanodo)i Mantelli, because he has specimens where he can see in situ liga-

mentnl Ijones stretching between the neural spines of the vertebrae ; for-, so far as

we know, the ligaments of animals never become ossified till they have attained

to considerable age. It appeared also from this paper that the author had made

a vast accumulation of Iguauodon bones and teeth of various sizes, and from these

he is led to believe that not only is the small Iguauodon in question a new species,

but that there were probably several species of the Iguauodon family existing at

the time when the Wealden formation was being deposited.

Artificial Roching-stones, an experiment. Bij W. E-. Grove, F.Ii.S.

   Some short time ago, during an excursion iu Cornwall, the author's attention
was naturally directed to rockiug-stones, and those approximations to rocking-
stones which are seen in the granite where it is exposed to the action of heat and
cold, air and water. It need hardly now be contended that rocking-stones are na-
tural results, and not superposed on their pedestals, as was once believed, by the
hand of man.

   Throughout the greater part of the granitic rocks of the west coast of Cornwall

formations are to be seen approaching in character to rockirg-stoues or to discoid

piles like the Cheese wing.

 --If we suppose a slab of stone of a parallelopiped form lying on another, both

having flat surfaces or, iu other words, such slabs as are formed by fissures in

--horizontal and perpendicular directions, which are common iu exposed granite

rocks the attrition and disintegration produced by changes of weather, of tempe-
rature, &c., would necessarily act to the greatest extent at the corners, and next to

that at the edges, because these parts expose respectively the greater surfaces com-
pared with the bulk of the stone. This would tend to round off all the angles and
gradually change the rhomb, more or less towards an oblate spheroid. This would

account for the Cheesewing &c. But then, it may be asked, why should this pro-
cess gradually work on to a rocking-stone ? in other words, why should the last

unworn point, points, or line be in the line joining the centre of gravity of the

upper stone with that of the earth ?

   Such an accident, it may be said, might happen, but the chances are almost
iuftnitj' to a unit against it. Not so. Assume the wearing away between the

slates to reach a point which is not in the line of centres of gravity : the upper
stone would then fall on one side, leaving the unworn point most exposed to cli-
niatal and probabty to electro-chemical action from the water h'ing in the angle
of the crevice, evaporation being less rapid there than at other parts. This pomt
would then be worn away aud the stone would fall back a little, then fredi action
upon new surfaces, another oscillation, and so on. The effects above explained as
taking place by steps would in fact take place by insensible progression. As-
suming this process^ unless there be some interfering action, it becomes not impro-

bable that the last point or line worn away would be the point or line on which,
from its being in the line of centres of gTayity, the upper stone would rock.

   After seeing the great Logan Stone near the Lands End, so many other approx-

imations to rocking-stones along that coast were traced that it seemed proved, as far

as could be expected on such a subject of inquiry, that this was a correct theory. If
this view were true, it seemed probable that the operations of nature might be

hastened so as to produce artificially (if such a term may be used) the rocking-stone

Arc"ults. very little thought suggested the experiment. Two pnrallelopipeds of

iron, which had been made for keepers of magnets, were taken, similar, but that one
was twice the length of the other. The shorter was superposed on the longe ·, and
both immersed in sulphuric acid diluted with three times its volume of water.
Some nitric acid was added at first to hasten the corrosion. Tne liquid was

changed from time to time as it became nearly satui'ated, but without changing

the position of the iron. At the erd of three or four days the pieces of iron were
taken out, washed, and examined, when the upper one was found to be a perfect
analogue of a rocking-stone, so delicately balanced on two points that it could be
made to rock by blowing on it with the mouth [result shown].

It was observed in this experiment that the iron rocked onlj- in one direction.

Such is the case with the great Loga'i Stone, and possibly with the greater num-

ber of rocking-stones. It is obviouslj' more probable that a stable equilibrium

Ashould be attained on two points than on one.  specimen capable of rocking or

spinning on one point has not yet been obtained [approximation to this shown by

two zinc disks, and explained]. If the surfaces of the slates be in such close contact

that there is not room for circulation of the saturated liquid, a formation like those
near the Cheesewing will be effected ; or if a number of disks or slates be supei-posed

and the lower ones more exposed to the weather, so as to catch the di'ipping and diift-

ing water from the upper, we should get a formation exactly like the Cheesewing,
which maybe called an incipient compound rocking-stone, in that each slab is worn
away at the edges, and the lower ones much more than the upper, so that, if left

alone, which it will not be, and if it does not topple over too soon, which it pro-

bably will, it might well end in a rocking-stone. Very possibly it may rock now

in a gi'eat storm.

On the Alternate Elevations and Subsidences of the Land, ami the order of

   Succession of Strata in Norfolk and Suffollc. By the Rev. J. Gunn.

This paper is supplementary to that read by the author at the Meeting of the

British Association at Dundee on the " Periodic recurrences of Oscillations of Level

and Changes of Climature," which may be said to have reached their maximum.

Some of a more limited and local operation, which appear to have taken place

during the progress of one elevation or subsidence to another, formed the subject

of this paper. Among these the author particularized an upheaval which toolc

place during the formation of the river-valleys, and may be seen at Lophamford

in Norfolk. There the singular phenomenon of a watershed presents itself in the

lower par'i of the valley, from which watershed the AVaveney and the Little Ouse

Atake their rise.   road traverses the valley descending from the high laud of

South Lopham , and leading to the high land on the opposite side in Suffolk. From

either side of this road the v^^ater rises which forms, or rather is the commence-

ment of these rivers, which, together with a few feet of the causeway, form the

boundary of Norfolk and Suffolk. It is evident that, had the watershed been

originally on tliis spot, the upper part of this valley (about fiftj' feet) could not have

been excavated, and that the present arrangement is clue to an uphearal, which

caused the water, which had previously flowed in one direction, to flow to the east

Aand to the west on either side of the watershed.  niagiiiiicent bed of valley-

gravel near the ford, on the Suffolk side, attests the power of the original stream,

which is now divided and dwindled to a small rill by this oscillation of levels.

The author next referred to the Forest -bed on the Norfolk and Suffolk coast and

the laminated series overlying it, observing that no deposit more strikingly exhi-

bited the effects" produced by alternate elevations and depressions than the Forest-

bad. It was formed, in part, at least, in a basin of chalk, which was covered ^-ith.

a mastodon-bearing bed of angular flints ; and its position was well defined, as it
was r early uniformly on the horizon of high-water level; and consequently,
wherever the chalk met that horizon, the Forest-bed existed upon it, as at Cromer
and Eunton. Though not easy to accertain its south-eastern boundary, as the
chaUv did not extend there, yet it might be presumed to be a mastodon-bearing
bed at Eastou Bavent, upon which the Forest-bed abutted, as it did upon the chalk,
without overlying ii. It was composed of a light blue clay remarliable for false
stratifications and an indurated gravel, auswev'ng to the loess and vallej'-gTavel,
which marked another point of agreement with the river-valley formations. These
component parts, especially the gi-avel, abound with the remains of several
species of Elephas and Cerviis, which were found not rolled but sharply broken,
together -ndth the bones of cetaceans of enormous size, and much drifted wood^
facts which indicated that the Forest-bed was a fluviatile or estuariue deposit open
to the sea, and that the Elephantine and Cervine remains had been carried into it

by some powerful current. He regarded the German Ocean as the vast trough or
river-bed, into which many tributary rivers poured their waters on the right and

left banks, but closed by chalk hills to the south, so as to afibrd a conunimication

between this country and the Continent, and a way for the mastodon, elephant,
and other mammals to traverse. The soil of the Fo-est-bed, after being thus

deposited, was raised to the surface, the forest grew upon it, a great cliange in
fauna took place, diti'erent species of elephants and deer were introduced, and
then, after remaining stationary for a long period, a gradual subsidence commenced
and the laminated series began to be formed. After showing, from the researches

of palaeontologists, that -^dth these laminated beds the temperature progi-essively

lowered, the author enumerated these beds ; namely, the fresliwater beds, as at
Mimdeslej- and Runton then the brackish beds, as the Pinna-bed at Mundesley

                                                                                                                                  ;

next, marine, and, among them, the Upper Norwich Crag, and the Chillesford

sand and clays, as the land continued to subside, were deposited successively in
deeper and deeper water, and ^\^th shells of an increasingly arctic character. In
thus placing the Chillesford sand and claj'S above the Fo 'est-bed, he had deviated
from the opinion entertained by ^Ir. Prestwich and other geologists, and formerly
by himself; but a close examination of the Chillesford clay at Chillesford had led

him to affirm the identity of the clay deposited at other places which he men-
tioned. Reference was then made by the author to the finding by Dr. Woodward
in the laminated series at Scratly, of a specimen of the Valuta LamheHii. The
identity of these beds was further increased by other gentlemen finding the same

shell in them.

   Passing over Mr. Woodward's corroboration of the true position of the Forest-
bed, the author referred to Sir C. Lyell's 'Principles,' wherein he remarked that
the refrigeration of the climate, evidenced by shells of an arctic character in the
Chillesford beds, was such as to render a change of climate and an oscillation of its
level necessary for the introdiiction of the Forest-bed, which he was inclined to
regard as interglacial. With all respect to Sir C. Lyell, the author said it appeared
to him that if such were the case, there would be shells of an arctic character
dicovered prior to the Forest-bed, whereas all the antecedents of the bed, especially
the mammalian remains, evidenced a continuous progression from the warmer cli-
mature of the Mastodon-bearing bed to the more temperate climature of the Forest-
bed. The Mastodon altogether disappeared in it, but the Elephas (Loxodon)
meridionalis retained all the rugosity of its disks. The author next spoke of the
niammaliferous bed of flints, containing remains of the Mastodon arvernensis, as
having been regarded as part of the mammaliferous Crag, but he considered that it
ought to be placed in the older Pliocene, while the upper parts of it shoidd be

assigned to the Pleistocene. No mention had been made by him of the Coralline
and Red Crags, because he was inclined to regard them as members of an entirely
distinct river-system. An examination of changes " of oscillation " of the levels

might be carried into the older strata, so as to aflord proofs of repeated subsidences
and reelevatious of the site of the present German Ocean, which would render the

above statements quite common-place.

            On some recent Blscoveries of Fossils in tlie Camhrian RocJcs.
                             Bi/ Henry Hices, M.R.C.S.E.

   lu tlie " Report on tlio Menevian Group and the other Foraiatlons at St. David's "
to the British Association in 1866, hy Mr. Salter and the author, it was stated tliat
no fossils had at that time bsen discovered bj' them during their researches in the
neighbourhood, below the topmost purple beds of the Cambrian rocks, or rather
in tliat series consisting of purple, red, and green sandstones, shales, and conglo-
merates, well known to belong to the " Harlech group " of Prof. Sedgwick, and
" Upper Longmynds "' of Sir R. Murchison.

  Tn the summer of last year,however, the author was fortunate enough to find a small
Linr/tdella in one of the red beds at the upper part of the series, and soon after-
wards the same species in beds much lower, along with indications of other fossils.
During the present summer, again, the author has been able to go still deeper, and
to prove beyond doubt the presence in the series of a really rich fauna, com-

prising species belonging to no less than t)i different f/cncra (in addition to the
tracts and burrows of Annelids), and consisting of Trilobites, Phyllopods, Brachio-

pods, and Pteropods. Thereifore that portion of the Cambrian rocks known
as the "Harlech group" or "Upper Longmynds," cannot henceforth (and as it

has hitherto been) be classed with the so-called sterile bases of the fossiliferous
rocks, but rather looked upon as a highh' important group, which contained the
imperishable monimieuts of almost the earliest states of life known. These dis-
coveries also seem to lead the mind at once to .anticipate the more than probable
fact, that wherever sedimentary rocks occur, evidence of former life, in some shape,

IS likely to be present, and also to be disclosed ere long.
   The section exhibited was taken across the line of strike of the Cambi-ian beds,

on the coast to the south of St. David's, extending from the central mass of
altered beds (syenite of the Survey map) to the base of the " Menevian group,"

Over 1200 feet of the section are now known to contain fossils, and to hare be-

longed to a period when the Crustacea, Brachiopoda, and the Annelida were in

existence ; the lowest fossils found, next to the Annelid markings and tubes,

being Liiu/uMIa and a small bivalved crustacean nearly allied to Leperditia. The

valves of the latter are found as small ovate, convex plates. The author's friend ]Mr.

Salter, to whom he sent some specimens, states that the " regular convexity and mar-

ginate outline show them to be nearly perfect valves. The oblique, parallel, but

inosculating plication agrees with crustacean ornament, and no other ; and the evi-

dently thin shell (with no lines of growth) suggests a carapace of a crustacean,

and not the shell of a Brachiopod, which is the only obvious alternative."' These

occur, along v/itli Lin^iuldlu fvrrwjinea, in some rather tine-grained red beds inter-

vening between the olive-green grits, almost at the base of the section, and the

purple sandstones above. They are also tolerably plentiful : but the colour of the

rock is rather unfavourable to the exhibition of their minute characters. In tbo

succeeding thick and compact beds of purple sandstones scarcel)' any traces of

sons why a Cambrian faima lias not been discovered before.

     Tlie fossils already discovered in this bed include a new genus, Pbikmia, with

species of Pdradoxkle^, Microdisnis, Conoconjphc, A//tiostu!f, Theca, Bisctmt, OhoMla,

and Liiif/iiMla ; the shells seem much like species in the " Menevian gi'oup," and

are probably identical ; but tlje Trilobites are all new species, and the new genus,

for which tlie author proposes the name Flxfoiu'a, is only kno-mi to occur in these beds.

This remarkable fossil is of very large size, equalling, indeed, in this respect Pff/-«f/o.i'-

ides IJavidi.s. It is perhaps also more nearly allied to the genus Piu-adoxides than

to any other known, but its peculiar character of being covered all over with very

strong tubercles, associated with an unusual position for the eye suture, and straight,

very long thoracic pleurfe, is sufficient to stamp it a new and distinct (/ouis.

     Resting upon the yellowish-grey rocks in which this richly fossiliferous bed

occurs, is another series of purple and red sandstones, also slightly fossiliferous

and these directly underlie the grey beds of the " Menevian group," which con-

tain Puradoxidcs Aurora and other fossils. Mr. Salter and the author have at dif-

ferent times proposed, in consequence of the lithological resemblance of the lower or

Paradoxides Aurora beds of the " Menevian group " to some of the beds of the " Har-

lech gi'oup," to have the " Menevian " included in the Lower Cambrian. This
now seems to the author more than ever necessary, and on palreontological grounds

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

for the genera, so far discovered, are either identical or very nearly allied ; and some

of the species are the same in both groups. On the other hand, there is very

little connexion palaiontologically between the " Menevian group" and the over-

lying " Ffestiniog group." No representatives of the more remarkable " I\Iene-

vian " gemra appear there ; Paradoxides, Micrndiscas, Erinnys, &c. are entirely

absent, tlie very far-ranging genera A(/nosttis and Cviiocori/p/ie seeming alone of

the Crustacea to reach upwards. Even with our present knowledge, therefore,

of the two faunas "Harlech" and "Menevian," an unusually close connexion

must be allowed to exist between them ; and doubtless the more wo know of

the two, the more intimate will this yet seem, and the more shall we see the

necessity of uniting both in the same geological division. To separate two such

groups even into Upper and Lower Cambrian seems scarcely possible or reason-

able                   but  to  attempt  to  have a boundary            for       the                       great  formations  " Silurian
                    ;

and " Cambrian " in the very heart of a period where such marked evidences

of similarity in the life which ranged through them occur, would only prove

once more the fallacy of artificial divisions instituted on purely h'f/iokr/ical grounds

instead of on evidence based on palseoutological facts. If the "Meneiian group"

be included along with the " Harlech group'' in the "Lower Cambrian " of Pro-

fessor Sedgwick or " Cambrian'" of Sir II. Murchison, we shall ha^e a well-marked

upper boundary to the formation defined by such genera as Paradoxides, 3Iicro-

diseus, Anopolenus, Erinnys, and other allied                           forms                               and as these are altogether so

very distinct from any yet found in the higher groups, this limit is not at all litely

to be disturbed by any future discoveries.

     On the Ferrufjinons Sandstone of the JS'eic/hhourJiood of Northampton.

                                   By Chaeles Jecks.

Having devoted some attention to the ferruginous sandstone of the Lower Oolite

in the immediate neighbourhood of Northampton, the author suggested the follow-

ing as the mode of its formation. Let the existence of a wide estuaiy be supposed,

into which mighty livers discharge themselves, depositing therein quantities of

sand, mud, &c. ; at times it may happen that one or more of the rivers above

referred to may, peihaps, in periods of unusual outflow, bring down and deposit in

the  estuary a certain amount of             iron                       let then  a subsidence be                  supposed,   followed

by the deposition of those shells inhabiting deeper water, and also accompanied

by the formation of what is called ironstone. Then after a long period of time

let (here be a gradual upheaval, and as the submerged land approaches the sur-

face, again an outpouring of iron, accompanied by the deposition of those shells

inhabiting shallower water, drift-wood, &c. ; and let this be continued for, it may

be, many hundreds, perhaps thousands of years, together with fresh depositions of

-would natm-ally be, in some measure at least, subjeeted"^ to more or less denudation,

and we have Tvliat seems to me an explanation of tlie formation of the ferruginous
sandstone encircling- the town of Northampton. Thus we have, in the first place,

accompanying a great subsidence, the deposition of deep-water shells, and the con-

version of the sand into so-called ironstone, often containing the casts of shells ; then
a certain amount of elevation, accompanied by the deposition of shells inhabiting

shallower water; then sandstone with nodules of clay and ironstone and small
pebbles, together vdth estuary shells *, ripple-marks, traces of serpuhe, and other

--marine annelides of which latter, ripple-marks &c., there is a very fine specimen

belonging to S. Sharp, Esq., in the Northampton Museum; and finally, layers of
waved bands of sand at times apparently pm-e from any trace of iron, and evi-

On the Oldest Beds of the Crags. By E. E.AT L.iNKESTEK.

In the county of Suffolk, lying on the London clay, wlierever the Red Crag or the

Coralline Crag is found, with few exceptions, is a Ijed from half a foot to three feet

thick, of large and small nodules, bones, and teeth. All the nodules are rounded

and waterworn, and so are the teeth and bones. They are e-\idenily the members

of an ancient stone beach, and form what the author calls the Suiiblk Bone-bed.

Most of the nodules are bits of rounded and worn clay, indurated with phosphate

of lime, for whirh the bed is worked, and by a misnomer this deposit has been

called the Coprolite-bed. I'he bits of clay which form the so-called coprolite are

bits of London cl?.y, just as in Cambridgeshire bits of gault and of oolitic clay are

similarly phosphatized and worked as coprolite. Besides these nodules, thcSuf-

follv bone-bed contains two distinct sorts of mammalian remains, those of terrestrial

mammals (Mastodon. Rhinoceros, Tapirus, Ursus) and those oi' whales. In many

of its features this bone-bed is similar to Mr. Gunn's stone-bed. containing, as it

does, nodides and mammalian remains. The terrestria] mammals in both were

v.-ashed, no doubt, from the same laud-surface ; but whence come all the great

whales' remains and great sharlcs which are so abmidant in this Suffolk deposit,

--and which are absent in Norfolk? The answer to this question is they come

from a great deposit of an earlier age, like that found in Belgium known as the

Diestien or Black Crag                                                                                                                                     and in this vre have evidence of a warmer  sea, of a  more

--Mioccnc-lilre fauna than in any of our well-proserved East-AngLan crags either

Coralline, Red, or Norwich. Most perfect remains of more than twenty long-

snouted whales, such as now live iu tropical seas, of huge sharks 80 feet long, and

of a great seal with huge tuslvs, are found in the Diestien beds freshly and sharply

preserved. In our Suif)llc bone-bed these same bones and remains occur much

washed and waterworn. They have been washed out of Biestien beds, and are

proofs to us of tlio former existejice of Diestien strata in Suffolk. But besides

these remains, we find in the Suffolk bone-beds certain sandstone nodules which

the author has lately foimd strong reason to believe are bits of the old Diestien

deposits indurated and waterworn. This sandstone is even found adhcnng to

the sharks' and whales' teeth and bones, but never to the mastodons'. But

besides tliat, the specimens exhibited show a great number of shells preserved

in that sandstone. These shells are not the shells of the Red Crag, nor even of

the oralline Crag, for they occur among the waterworn nodules quite below

either of these deposits. It* is true that all the constituents of the Suffbllc Ijone-

bed are sometimes dispersed in small numbers through the Red Crag, but this is
what we must expect iu the depo.'3it of so destructive a sea. The most important

   * Since the above paper was read, I find that a species of shell, which I believed to bo

estuarine, is not so, and therefore tlie statement about estuary-shells must be somewhat

modified. I believe, however, that these shells will still be found by a creful search after

them.--C. J.

fact about these nodules is the abundance of a. Black Crag or Diestien shell, Iso-

canlia hundata. The shell does not occur in either Red or Coralline Crag-; but out

of every forty nodules with fossils in them, you have seven specimens of Isocardia.

Even Isocardia cor is most rare in our English Crags. Only half a dozen speci-

mens have been found altogether in the Coralliue and Eed Crag. The presence of

this shell in these nodules proves that the nodules are bits of a very different

deposit, and probably of a Diestien age, not necessarily of eaaci equivalence with
Wethe Belgian Black Crag.
                           know how much a few miles of distance may affect

a marine fauna; and it is most probable that the Sutiblk deposits were always

littoral or sublittoral, while those of Belgium accumulated in deep water. These

--nodules, which probably are of gTeat importance, are supposed by some to be of

indurated Coralline or Red Crag by Mr. Searles Wood and, the author believed,

by Sir C. Lyell ; but a careful examination only is required to convince anv one

that such is not their mineral structure, and that the shells and bones they contain

are those of Diestien age. The ditlerence between the Diestien fauna and the

Red and Norfolk Crag fauna is very great. Great changes as to glaciation have

gone on between the two. The Coralline Crag bridges over the break in part, as

does the yellow Antwerp Crag. The presence of derived Mastodon-remains in

the Red and Norfolk Crag, and of Diestien Cetacea in the Red Crag too, is always

most deceptive, and tends to mislead the judgment as to the true character of

those beds.

         On the Range and Distribution of the British Fossil BracMopoda*.

                              By J. Logan Loblet, F. G.S.

    This paper was read in explanation of a series of Tables exhibited to the Section,
 and prepared with the view of showing, by a new arrangement, the range, distri-

 bution, increment, decrement, and maximum development of each subgenus, genus,

 and family, as well as of the class of Brachiopoda in British strata. The paper
 contained a summary of the results sliown by the Tables, and was accompanied by
 lists of the species hitherto discovered in each formation, or minor gTOup of rocks,
 in which the class is represented.

    The first of the Tables gives the range and distribution of each genus, the genera
 being arranged in the order of their incoming or earliest appearance in British
 strata. The number of species of each genus in any geological formation is repre-
 sented by short thicli: lines, each of wliich indicates the presence of one species.

These lines are so arranged that the increment, decrement, and maximum deve-

lopment of each genus is distinctly shown, and the number of species of each genus
in each formation in which it appears may be at once ascertained.

    The second Table gives the genera arranged according to their family alliances,
and shows the family to which each genus belongs, the order in which each family
has appeared, and the nuniljer of species as well as of genera in every formation in
which the family is found.

    The third table is a summary of tlie second, in order to show more distinctly
the increment and decrement of each family v.ithout reference to its genera, each

line representing a species as in the other Tables.

   The fourth Table is a siunmary of the third, to represent at a glance the relative

importance of the representation of the class Brachiopoda in each geological
formation.

   The following are some of the more prominent results shown by these Tables.
Of the fortj^-seven genera and subgenera, eleven are represented by species now
living in the seas of our globe, and are therefore recent as well as fossil genera.
Of these, Discina, Liiujula, Crania, lihyiichonella, and Terehruiida range from
Palreozoic recks. The genera Leptcena, Spirifcra, and Spirifcrlna range from

Pahcozoic inco Mesozoic, but do not reach Cainozoic strata, while each of the
following twelve genera is characteristic of a single formation : Kutorgina (Lin-
gida flags), Acrotreta (Llandeilo), Orthisina (Caradoc), Orbicidoidea (Wenlock),
Nacleospira (Wenlock), Merista (Middle Devonian), tincites (Middle Devonian),

(Middle Devonian), Terchrirostra (Upper Grernsand), Mar/as (Chalk). Tliiriy

genera are essentially PaUieozoic, and eiglit genera have not been found in any

other than Mesozoic strata, tliougrh four of these liave living- representatives, -while

not one genus can be considered characteristic of Cainozoic strata.

Of the nine families in which the forty-seven geneia and subgenera mav be

placed, one, rrochiriida-, is confined to PaLTozoic strata, and one, Thecidictcc, is

characteristic of Mesozoic rocks. This family, however, although not represented

in Cainozoic strata, has a species living in the present seas. iStropJiomeiiidcc and

Hph-ifend(e may almost be said to be Paloeozoic, .since very few species of either

of these families have been found in rocks newer than the Permian, while in older

strata the species of both are most numerous.

The families which range from the Palaeozoic rocks to the present time, and arc

represented by recent species, are L'Ju/uUdcc, Disci/rider, C'raiiiadcr, H/ii/ncJwiieUidfc,

and TcvchratuUda.

  When we consider the range and distribution of the class as a whole, wc find

tliat it is represented in British strata by a very large number of species, some of

which are found in almo.st every geological formation. Coming into existence, as

we find again a laige number of .species, which, however, become fewer as we

ascend Die scale until we reach the Portland rock.s, in which no Brachiopod has

been found. The class again increases in importance in Cretaceous strata, and

again diminishes in Tertiary formations, which Lave yielded hitherto not more than

eight or nine species.

On the occurrence of Spherical Iron Nodules in the Loivcr Greensand.

                                  Bij John Loave, M.D.

Two years ago a large number of spherical pieces of sandstone was found in a

railway-cutting at Walferton, near Lynn. They were mostly about the size of

ordinary marbles, and were found to consist of a variable number of concentric

laminae resembling the ordinary "car "-stone of the district, and containing in

their interior a (quantity of loose grains of pure sand, Mith occasionally a small

vitreous-looking fragment of organic matter.

 The  hill  througli    which  the  cutting  is  made  is  about 50 feet                                                                                                                                         in  height  at  its

_

highest point, and is composed of bands of yellow sand of variable degrees of hard-

ness, but always of a fiiable nature. On the summit is a thin layer of iron or car-

stone, which is largely used for building. There is no superincumbent chalk

nearer than Sandringham, a distance of about a mile and a half

   On examining the sides of the cutting, the sand was found to be perforated by

some boring animal (a large species of Teredo? or F/iohis?). The borings have

generally a horizontal direction, but sometimes pass upwards from one fayer of

sand into another. They are usually long and somewhat widely separate, never

apparently cro.ssing each other, as is "seen in Pholas-borings. Tli"ey are tilled with

sand of a niucli coarser quality than that which surrounds them", but when they

take an upward direction the sand they contain is of a tiner grain. The periphery

of the borings is hardened by the deposition of iron, so as to form a tube. At the

extremity of each there occurs one of the spherical bodies above described.

It is obvious that all the borings have been tilled with sand, carried in and

deposited by water, and that a stream of ferruginous water has subsequently per-
colated through the bed of sand, giving rise at the same time to the nodules and
to the hardened periphery of the tubes.

It .seems not improbable that the deposition of the iron has been determined by

trict, wood or other orsanic matter is commonly present, and seems to have served

as a nucleus of attraction for the iron. Even in the adjacent peat-beds logs of

wood are found converted into solid crystalline iron pyrites. [Specimens of iron-

On the roots of willow in sand-pits in Lincolnshire. There is therefore ground for

supposing that the remains of the boring animal in the end of the tubes gave rise

to the spherical nodules, and that the hardened circumference of the borings was

in the same manner due to the pi-esenco of traces of organic matter left in the

process of boring.

The position and general configuration and geological character of the colony

of Natal were described, and the presence of coal-deposits on the surlace in various

positions Avas explained. The histoiy of the gradual discovery of the deposits was

briefly sketched, and the quality and character of the coal was then considered.

In the last and most important trial recently made to determine the question of

quality, seven tons were used on board the surveying-ship ' Hydra,' and compared

with equal quantities of Cardilf and "West-Hartley coal. The result of this expe-

riment was, that steam was up with Carditl' coal in UO minutes, with 2(3 cwt. con-

   For easy steaming the Natal coal was deemed nearly equal in commercial value
to Cardiff coal ; but with full steam a larger quantity of Natal coal was required
on account of the masking of the combustion with ash.

   Specimens of the coal and of organic remains of Glossopteris, from the coal-
deposit of Bushman's Eiver, were exhibited, and the inference was drawn that in
all probability the Natal coal will prove to be of the Jurassic or Cretaceous age.

                     Graff. By Gi;op,ge Maw, F.G.S., F.L.S., 6fc.

   In connexion with a large diagrammatic section from the neighbourhood of Aid-
borough in Sufiblk to the Norfolk coast, and detailed sections of the strata at
different localities, drawn to scale, reference was made to the various disputed
points on the sequence of the more recent deposits of the eastern counties.
Although the supei'position of the Chillesford beds on the Norwich Crag had been
questioned so recently as during the late session of the Geological Society of
London, it was now, the author believed, admitted by every geologist acquainted
with the district. It was suggested in general tenns by Mr. Prestwich, eighteen
years ago ; and the recent labours of Mr. J. E. Taylor, in the Norwich district, in
distinguishing and separating the upper from the Lower Norwich Crag, had fixed
--74 REPORT 1868.

 an exact horizon. by which the series in Norfolk and Suifolk could he correlated.

 MawMr. considered that the whole of the beds above the oblique fen-uginous Red

 Crag in the well-known Chiliesford Crag-pit pertained to the Chillesford Clay-
 series. The Fluvioniariue, or Lower Norwich Crag, was here wanting ; but he

 disagreed with those who considered the obliquely bedded ferruginous Red Crag
 as the equivalent of the Norwich Crag ; for in its occurrence at Thorpe, in Suftblk,

 within three and a half miles of Chilleiford, it showed no approach in either its
 physical or paliBontological features to the Red Crag. The Chillesford beds ex-
 tend transgressively over the Coralline Red and Fluviomarine Crags, and do not
 appear to pass upwards in conformable succession from any of the subjacent beds.
 The upper part of the Chillesford beds probably graduate into the drift underlying
 the Boidder-clay of High Suftblk. These were considered older than the coast
 beds of Cromer," and appear to partake of the general denudation contoiu- of the
 country, having been extensively denuded in the excavation of valleys that are
 cut deeply through them into tne chalk and other older formations. The coast-
 beds, including the forest-bed of Cromer (with which the author identified the
 other forest-beds along the S.E. and S. coasts), the laminated beds, and the over-
lyino- Boulder-till and contorted drift, were considered more recent, being deposited
 after a long interval of denudation and disposed with reference to the existing
 coast outline. The resemblance in the fauna and flora of the Mur.desley fresh-
water deposit to that of the forest and laminated beds was noticed, and the
 Mundesley peat and other thin layers of similar matter in the Norfolk coast-till,
were considered to be merely a recurrence of the laminated beds at its base. The
Thames valley deposits at Grays Thurrock might be contemporaneous with the
Norfolk coast-beds, and they exhibit a contorted structure at their base. The
phenomenon of " trail " or surface furrowing and rearrangement of drift, which
had been described by the Rev. O. Fisher as the result of land-ice, did not appear
to be accountable on any other theory. It seems to have been one of the most
recent phenomena applied to the general denudation contour of the land-surface.
It was not confined to the east of England ; and the author exhibited a drawing
of a section of stratified drift at the Bangor Station, North Wales, which had been
rearranged in surface-furrows and pouches similarly to ]\Ir. Fisher's " Trail " in the
east of England. It was possible that it might have been contemporaneous with
the deposition of the glacial beds on the Norfolk coast, which were also deposited
subsequently to the land-surface receiving its present denudation contour.

   When examining an oolitic quarry at Falkland the author discovered in a fissure

at about 40 feet from the surface, a drift with a number of small teeth and bones
of mammals, and that subsequently he obtained them in great abundance, many
of them belonging to small rodents. His attention being thus directed to the
presence of mammalian remains in the fissures of the Oolite, he had since obtained
them of many genera under similar circumstances along the escarpments of the
Oolite through Somersetshire and Gloucestersliire, associated with freshwater
shells and bog- iron ore, which latter forms a considerable proportion of the
material tilling up the fissures. At Falkland twenty-two hut circles had been
destroyed in quarrying the stone within a few years, and the author suggested it
was probable the liiaterial filling the hut circles and the oolitic fissm'es was of the
same age, though at the present time he had no distinct evidence to prove such to

be the case.

   The information which we possess as to the geology of the province of Bahia is
scanty, but, as fivr as it goes, satisfactory. The engineers Halfeldt, Vivian, and
Catohave examined respectively the Rio di Sao Francisco, the route from the

city of Bahia to Joazeiro on the same river, and to S* Isabel de Paraguassu in

Chapada by the Mate, or forest of Orobo.

   The conclusions which may be arrived at from these and other sources are,

generally, that

   1. There is a imiform strike and dip throughout the province within these
limits, say, N.N.E. and S.S.W., with comparatively little variation.

   2. The province may be geologically divided into zones.

    (1) Conglomerate and schists near the coast.
   (2) Sandstone in the Reconcavo from the citj' to the Lago of the river Para-

guassu.

   (3) 0[ primitive rock extending to the pastoral district of the Serra da Man-

gabeira.

   (4) Of sandstone in that serra.
   (o) Of primitive rock ^vith nearly level surface (Taboleiros). This is some twenty
leagues in breadth, and is the district of cataracts on the rivers. It is traversed
by enormous masses of quartzose rock.
   (6.) Of forests iinder which probably sandstones predominate.
   (7) Of limestone.
   (8) Of conglomerates forming the Chapada, so called from the horizontal line
which the tops of the hills present to the eye. All these cross the province from
the Rio Paraguassu to the Rio di Sao Francisco.
   The Chapada is 200 miles from the west side of the Bay of All Saints, commonly
known as Bahia, i. e. the bay which is again twenty-seven miles from the city of
that name. It forms the eastern watershed of the Rio di Sao Francisco, aud has
within itself the sources of the rivers which fall into the sea within the circuit of the

great river. Its height above the level of the sea may be approximately stated as
iiOOO feet. The diamond workings are carried to the top. The conglomerates of

the Chapada diti'er from those of the coast principally in that the former are, and
the latter are not, highly metamoi-jihic ; they have also greater development in the

Chapada, as schistose formations, have on the coast ; both contain diamonds, but
those near the coast have been discovered but recently, and for local reasons the
workings, though rich, have been abandoned.

   The geological series at the Chapada is, descendiug-

These are traversed by dykes and veins of trap and chert, and intervening between
the harder rocks, veins of dirt are not uncommon, as also of sand and clay-slate.
These afford facilities for the entrance of water between the strata, by which their
rapid disruption is effected and caverns, named Granais, are often formed by the

disintegration of the softer rocks beneath the conglomerate.
   While at the Chapada (December 18uoJ the author ascertained that the quartzite

is the matrix of those crystals of iron pyrites the pre.-ence of which marks the dia-
mond caseallio or gravel, but saw no trace of diamonds in that rock ; and since they
abound in the Gruuais, of which the conglomerate forms the roof, concluded that
diamonds are formed in the softer veins and strata which separate the harder rocks.

When diamonds are found, cascalho (a water-wom gravel) is present. The most

marked constituents of this are :

1. Crj'stals of pyrites.                                             6. Pingua d'agoa (rolled hyaline

   What may be called imperfect diamonds are also found ; the most important of
these is the " Carbonate," which is now commonly used in cutting diamonds.

   The diamond-workings of the Chapada had, twenty years ago, the town of Santa
Isabel as their centre ; since then they have moved northward to Lencoes, now a
city, and hfive extended more than thirty miles beyond it.

   There seems no reason why the jield of diamonds should decrease so long as the
present price is maintained ; new localities, not only in the Chapada, but in other
parts of the province, as at Pitanga, near Bahia, already noticed, will be found when

required, and the province maintain its reputation of being the main source from
which the market is supplied. The value of diamonds raised cannot be accurately
determined, since only a small part conies to Europe through the regailar channels,

but it may probably exceed £500;000 in favourable seasons^ i. e. when water is

abimdant.

           On the Fossil Fislies of Cornwall. Btj C. W. Peach, A.L.S.

    In 1841 the author read a paper at the Meeting at PIj^mouth on Cornish Fossils,

in which he said that he had found, at " Punch's Crossquarry Fowey, portions of ttsh

remains." At the Meeting at Cork in 1843 he exhibited liner and better .specimens,

some of them found by Mr. Couch at Polperro, and still considered them portions

of fishes, and was supported in this opinion bj' the late Professor E. Forbes and

others present there. Up to 1849 he did all possible to extend his researches,

and on both sides of the county ho was fortunate enough to get fish-remains. In

December of that year he left Cornwall, and has not been there since. Fi.shes

these things were considered until 1855, when Professor M'Coy, after a visit to

Cornwall with Profes.'^or Sedgwick, stated, in ' The British Palaeozoic Fossils,'

published at Cambridge, '' that he had carefulty examined some of the specimens in

the museums of Penzance and Truro, and many others that he had collected

and had sections prepared for the microscope, and had come to tlie conclusion

that they were not Fishes, but Spoiif/ef:, of which he made out two species." I^p to

April last they have been considered so, wlieu Mr. E. Wyatt Edgell, in a letter in

the Geological ^Magazine, asserted that the so-called Stcganodiciywn, or sponges,

of JM'Coy, were true Jishcs, belonging to Iteraspk, and since Professor Huxley,

and Messrs. E. Pay Lankester, Salter, and Woodward have stated the same. Tlius,

then, although these fossils have been so loug under a cloud, light has broken in

upon them, and now their true history will be told by Messrs. Powrie and E. Ray

Lankester in their beautiful monogTaph of these hitherto obscure Pteraspid forms.

Since learning tlie change of opinion, he turned out the contents of a box pncked

in Cornwall in 1849, and, amongst a few pretty specimens of fish-remains, foimd

a   splendid    but  imperfect  cephalic  shield of Pteraspis, six inches  in  length                                                                                              it  is

beautifulh' marked with delicate waved lines, and .shows tubercles and cancel-

lated structure. As it is so innch larger tlian any figured in the monograph above-

mentioned, no doubt it will prove a new species. Although he has remained silent

so  long,  his  opinion has never  changed as  to the fish-nature  of these remains                                                                                                and
                                                                                                                                                                                ;

in all his rambles over the rocks of the Old Red Sandstone in Scotland, with the

exception of one small piece, tubercidated like the dermal plate of a Coccostens,

and also the cancellated structure in the decayed bones of Osteolepis, he has found

none like the Cornish ones. The same network cancellated structure is to be seen

in carboniferous fishes. This structure deceived Professor M'Coy and others, and
hence their objection, because no similar appearance is known in the bone of any

living animal.

face of the deposit when the block fell, that the deposit was capable of ottering- a

iiriu resistance to a lieavy falling mass, and that tlie Cave-earth was introduced into

the Cavern successively and at many different times.

The third class consisted of bones broken with an oblique fracture, and precisely

resembled the larger remnants left by Hyseuas, as the author had found by a series

of experiments which he had made at the Zoological Gardens, London.

The fourth class of bones were those which had been split longitudinally, with a

fracture more or less clean. Having shown that they were not divided by the

Carnivora, nor by exposure to the weather, the author proceeded to show experi-

mentally that Man, with no other tools than such as lie could readily have com-

manded in the Paloeolithic age, was perfectly capable of  splitting them                                                                                      and gave

               On the Crag at Aldehij. By C. B. Eose, F.G.S. Sfc.

  In the summer of 186.5 the author was shown some mammalian bones from a brick-
yard at Aldeby, near Beccles, but on the Norfolk side of the Waveney. Their colour
and character indicating the existence of a Crag deposit, the author took an early
opportunity of examining the spot from whence the bones were taken, and there
his suspicion was quickly confirmed. After repeated visits to the localitj' he was
enabled to give the following section. Beueatli the vegetable soil lies a bed of
coarsish flint gravel, 4 to 6 feet in thickness, followed by sand and shingle 1 to 2

feet thick. Immediately beneath this lies an excellent brick-earth loam, varying
in thickness from 3 to 7 feet ; this loam encloses a few subangular flints, and no

other en-atic bodies. To the loam succeeds a fine ferruginous sand to the depth of
6 feet, enclosing an abundance of the usual Upper Crag shells, the majority of the
bivalves with the valves disunited. At the depth of 3 feet in this sand occurs a

bed of Mya arenaria of all ages, with their valves united, and in the position in
which they lived and died. Two separated valves of Mya trimcata were only met

with. It was in the immediate \icinity of this il/^«-bed that the fragments of an
antler of a Cervus was found, and also the vertebra of a small cetacean.

    Cyprina islancUca was abundant, but, unlike the Mya, the valves were invariably

disunited.

   At the depth of 6 feet below the brick-earth is found a bed of shells in which

Astarfes predominated, with both valves united, whereas in the upper bed the valves
were almost invariably fojiud separated. Here the presence of water put a stop to
further digging. The author boi-ed beneath the ^4.s^ff/-^c-bed 8 feet; in a somewhat
loamy sand with traces of shells.

   In determining to what member of the Crag formation the Aldeby bed belongs,
the author compared it with the approximating Crag beds of Norfolk, iu preference
to those of Sutt'olk, and more particularly with the Brammerton Crag (see Richard

 C. Taylor's section, published iu the Geol. Trans, for 1823), a section to be
 depended on.

   jSow comparing the horizon of the Brammerton pit with that of Aldeby, the author
feels compelled to place the Crag of Aldeby and the upper beds at Brammerton in
the same category, and consequently under the denomination of Norwich Crag.

    Fifty-six of the usual mollusks of the mammaliferous Crag are met with at Aldeby,
viz. 40 bivalves, and 16 univalves. Also spines of Hpatanyus pnrptireus, and spines
 of an Echinus. Vertebra of a Delphinus, Otolites, and teeth of small fishes. Teeth
 of a small Rodent.

perfect. Its head very square ; the base of the svimmiug-foot small in proportion
to that of other species. The chelate antenure have the apices very greatly

                  On a Remarhahle Incrustation in Northamptonshire.

                           By Samuel Shaep, F.S.A., F.Q.S.

    In the section of a gi-avel-pit near Wold, about 14 miles N.N.E. of Northampton,
had been exposed a mass of incrustation of carbonate of lime, the nucleus of which
consisted of the water-plant Charu vidf/aris. This mass was 10 feet in horizontal
diameter as exposed in the section, and reached inwards about 4 feet from the
plane of that section, as first seen by the writer. Its thickness was about 2 feet to
2 feet Cinches. Above the mass of incrustation was a layer of a kind of calcareous
paste, of a thickness of from 6 to 10 inches ; and below it a similar layer of from .3 to
6 inches. This paste consisted entirely of the crushed material of the incrustation, of
which it contained many fragments. At the bottom was a mixture of gravel and
soil, of the thickness of about 9 inches.

   The gravel in the pit is stratified. The strata ran up to the mass of incrustation
on either side, sharply abutting upon it; and lower strata ran quite imdemeath,
showing that there had been no partial subsidence or disturbance below.

  --It was evident that there had been formerly a pool of water at this place about

10 feet across, and about 5 feet deep ; the form of which, as shown by excavation,
was basin-shaped, rounded at bottom, and spreading somewhat at top.

   The wi-iter concluded from these facts that this pool had been artificially formed
that the water had been highly charged with carbonate of lime ; that, when the
Chara came to grow in it, it became incrusted ; that, by the process of the alternate
or continuous growth and incrustation of the plant, th« pool ultimately had been
choked up, and becoming a mere quagmire, had finally been filled in with soil.
The mixed gravel and soil at the bottom he thought had been the bottom of the
pool ; and the lower calcareous paste produced by pressure of the superincumbent
weight, and the upper by the trampling of cattle in drinking.

   The pit is situated on the slope of a valley ; the gravel is % ery open, and over-
lies the porous beds of the ferruginous Northamptonshire sands ; these repose upon

the Upper Lias. No water had ever been known to, nor under existing conditions

--could possibly, stand in this gTavel-pit.
   The writer, therefore, contended as great alterations in the local conditions had
taken place since the time when this pool was formed and water accumulated in
it to such a depth as to allow the Chara growing luxuriantly to within a foot of
the surface : as those alterations probably in-\-ohed an ele-^-ation of the district and
the excavation in whole or in ]iart of the present valley ; and as the formation of
the pool could only reasonably be accounted for by attributing it to human agency
that we had here auot er item of evidence of the high antiquitj' of the human

race.

              On the recent Discovery of Diamonds in tJie Cape Colony.
                             By Professor Tennant, F.G.S.

   This gem, tlie author stated, had been found somewhat abimdautlj' recently in
the above district ; and he exhibited the casts of some weighing nine carats, worth
500/. Some agate, chalcedony, and other precious stones found in the same de-

posit had been sent him, but he would have prefen-ed some of the sand and mud

in which they were deposited. One diamond, found verj- recently, weighed as
much as fifteen and a half carats. The author was of opinion that before long we
should have a large collection of diamonds from the above country, adding that,
although we had heard a great deal of diamonds being found in Australia, those

stones were not worth now so many pence as poimds had been asked for them.

       Notes on certain Reptilian Bemains found in the Carboniferous Strata of Lanarh-

                             shire. By Jaiues Thomson (Glasyou>).

           The attention that has been given recently to the Eeptiles of the coal-period,
       makes the discovery of new forms or more perfect specimens of the utmost impor-
        tance, as it will tend to throw light on species established hitherto on imperfect
        materials, more especially since the description of Anthracosaurtis JRusselli by Prof.
        Huxley in the Quarterly JoiU'nal of the Geological Society, vol. xix. p. 50.

           The specimens which the author exhibited to the Section were found a few days
       before the meeting at Quarter, parish of Hamilton, Lanarkshire. They occur in
        the parting between a bed of ironstone-shale and coal. The ironstone varies in
        thickness from 1 to 14 inches, and overlies the coal, which is from 5 to 15
        inches thick. The specimens are found lying on the surface of the coal, and
        invested by the superincumbent ironstone.

           The whole of the remains retain their original structure, some specimens having
        their original form, while in others this has been somewhat affected by the pressure
        of the superimposed beds. The largest and most important specimen is the greater
        part of a skull of Anthracosaurns, measuring 10 inches long by 8 inches wide
        posteriorly ; opposite tlie vomerine tusks it is 4 inches wide. The under side is
        turned upwards, exposing the stumps of forty broken teeth around its contour.

          On the same slab, and partly resting on the posterior portion of the skull, there is

        an under jaw, wdth the anterior face thrown backwards, and which probably belongs
        to the same reptile. Also another upper jaw, which was found in the same locality,
        measuring 121 inches long by 4 inches wide at the widest part, with 7 perfect teeth,
         and the stumps of 18 exposed; a slab of ironstone with three ribs, and a vertebra
        greatly flattened, showing the neural canal &c. ; while on detached pieces of coal
        are numerous bones and scutes. Also the anterior portion of two jaws of the so-
        called liJu'zodiis lanceiformis (P) ; the one is 9^ inches long by 2 inches wide, with
         8 perfect teeth, and the stimips of 7 exposed ; the other is 7 J inches long by 2 inches
        wide, and exposing 9 teeth, 5 of which are perfect, while the other 4 are partially
        broken. There is another reptilian jaw, the specific name of which the author
        was not acquainted with.

            In the same parting there occurs, in remarkable abundance, specimens of the
         Gyracanthus, both lateral and dorsal spines, bones, and scales of various forms of
         fishes ; such as Mcycdichthys, S'trej)sodiis, Flenrodiis, CtenacantJius major, C. minor,
         Pleuracanthus, Gyracanthus, Ctenodiis, and preserved in the same condition as those

          of the Reptiles.

           Oi Hkizuctus lanceiformis (?) the author had discovered remains at Braehead,
        Renfrewshire ; the beds in which they are found are at the base of our Scottish
        coal-measm-es in this part of Scotland, thus showing that this form had existed
        during the long period of time necessary for the deposition of upwards of GOO fathoms

          of strata.

           The bed of ironstone referred to is of limited extent, and belongs to the upper
        members of the Scottish coal-measures ; and at Quarter is 40 fathoms below the
        surface, and is the equivalent of the better known Airdrie black-baud ironstone.
        It is a small basin, and situated on the south side of the River A^·on, on the banks
        of which the ironstone crops out, while at its southern extremity it is thrown to

                                           Bij Prof. Otto Toeeell.

   The author exhibited a series of slabs marked by the impressions of -sarious land-
plants known to geologists by the name of chondrites. lie had these fossil plants
from a formation much older than any from which fossils have hitherto been ob-
tained. The rocks from which they were derived were of an ag-e similar to those
of the Longmynd rocks in ^^'ales. The under sides of many of the slabs were pitted
with the markings of laiu-di-ops ; and the conclusion which the author came to was,
that the character of the plants and the meteorological markings upon tbem indi-
cated that they had been dejiosited under shallow-water conditions. This he cor-
roborated by showing- that a bed of shingle or conglomerate was associated with
them, which he judged to have been part of an old sea-beach. The same slabs
were marked by the trails of marine worms that had crawled over them. The casts
of some of these worms were distinctly to be seen on the surface of the slabs. The
slabs were handed romid, and scrutinized most minutely by many geologists present.

       On the Glacial and Posfc/lacial Structure of Norfolk and Suffolk.

                By Seaeles V. Wood, Juu., and F. W. "Haemee.

   This paper was a summary of the results arrived at by the authors from a survey
and mappmg of the Crag and Glacial beds of Norfolk and Suffolk, upon the

Ordnance (one inch to the mile) map, which they have been carrying on duiing

the last four years. The paper was illustrated with a large map, constructed from

their survey map, and copious detailed sections, traversing the counties in v.arious

directions, without which the paper itself is difficult to be understood. The prin-

cipal results at which the authors have arrived at are as follows :

   That the Fluviomarine C'rag of Thoi-pe and Eramerton, and of "\\'angford,
Bulchamp, and Thorpe, near Aidborough, is coeval with the newer part of the Red

Crag.

   That the Crag of Burgh, Horstead, and Coltishall, in the Bure Vallej', is a fluvio-
marine development of the Chillesford shell-bed, or Crag of Easton and Aldeby,

which, divided from the lied and Fkniomarine Crag by an interval of sand of vary-

ing thickness, overlies the Eed Crag at Chillesford, and the Fluviomarine Crag

(or old Norwich Crag) at Thorpe and Bramerton.

   That the so-called C!rag of Belaugh, in the Bure "S'alley, and the so-called Crag
of the Weybourne and Cromer coast, are newer than the" Chillesford beds (which,

unless the pebble-beds next mentioned be a still higher part of the Crag series,
form the uppermost of the true Crag series), being characterized by the presence in

profusion of a shell unkno\^-n to any bed of the true Crag series from the Chilles-

ford   clay  do's\mwards, viz.                                                                 the  Tellina  solidula                                             and  were  introduced  after an
                                                                                                                                                               ;

elevation of the Crag area had converted the southern portion of it into land, and

given rise over the northern portion to extensive sands with pebble-beds,
which rest on and indent the Chillesford clay in that northern portion. These

sands with pebbles occupy in the south of Norfolk and north of Suflblk the same

 )lace relatively to the Contorted Drift as is occupied on the Cromer coast by the
\'kVeybourne sand (or so-called '· Crag" of the Cromer coast), the Cromer Till, and

the indenting sand (or bed c after-mentioned). These pebble-beds may thus

represent in time either the whole or any one of the formations a, is, and'c (de-

scribed further on)                                                                            or they may form "merely the closing l^ed of the true Crag

depositlno- the so-called Crag coutaining- Telliiui solidula), represent a land surfoce
of some period anterior to tliis so-called Crag. That as this period extends from

the close of the true Crag series downwards, such land surface may be either con-

temporaneous ^\\ih the true Crag series (which has no place on the nortliern coast

of  Norfolk                           or  uiaj'    be  of a  period  intervening  between  the  close  of that  series      and
                                ),

the actual submergence of nortliern Norfolk, which was accompanied by the intro-

duction of TeUina solidula, and the accumulation of the Weybourne sand, or so-

called " Crag " of the Cromer coast *.

   That the mammalian teeth and jaw fragments of terrestrial Mammalia CgeneraUy
more or less rolled), obtained as j-et from the Fluviomarine Crag and Chillesfor'd

beds, do not represent the mammalian fauna of the deposit in which they occur,
but are derivative from some older bed.

   That, contrary to the views of the Rev. John Gimn and others, who discover an
Upper and Lower Boulder-clay in the clitfs between Weybourne and Eccles, and

identify the former with the great Boulder- clay formation of the East of England,

the autliors regard everything in those clifts as inferior, not only to the great

Boulder-clay, but also to the extensive sands and gravels termed by them Middle

Glacial                               these sands  and gravels (which underlie a large part of the great Boulder-

terj only capping with their base the cliffs in places, but in greater mass forming

the sand hills, which immediately inland occupy higher ground than the top of the
clifts, and are spread extensively over northern Norfolk.

That all the beds of the cliff-section between Eccles and Weybourne (except the

patches of the base of the Middle Glacial sands, which in places cap it) form a

series of themselves which they term the Lower Glacial, and are throughout cha-

racterized bv the presence of TeJlina solidula. These are divisible into the following,
which are given in the ascenduuf order.

A. The Weybourne Sand, tlie base of which, when resting on the Chalk, is

often occupied                            an accumulation of shell-patche.s          knoviTi    to collectors as " The

Norwich Crag "Jjoyf the coast. This sand becomes,

lignite, and often laminated with bands of lignitiferous clav, in which condition it

constitutes the " laminated series " of the Rev. John Gunu. In that condition it

is unfossiliferous, the lignite intermixture apparently renderuig it unsuited for

molluscan life, of which the remains are usually present when in its pure condition.

This sand passes up by interbedding into

   B. The Cromer Tilf, or " Lower Boulder-clay " of Mr. Gunn, a sandy clay with
numerous small stones, and with occasionally a' boulder of larger dimensions.

   c. Sands which, where the cliff is uncontorted, are seen to be indented into a

deeply eroded surface of the Till, and to have themselves been also denuded, so as
to form an even floor for the ensuing formation, viz. :

D. The Contorted Drift. This bed is the widest spread of the Lower Glacial

series. It begins in the north of Suffolk as a reddish-brown brick-earth, a few

feet thick, resting on the sands with pebbles, before described, but sometimes the
pebbly sands have been removed. It comes up at the base of Pakefield and Corton

chfts (where, as well as in the sections at Bishops Bridge, Norwich, it is called bv
Mr. Gunn and others " Lower Boidder-clay "), and thickening rapidly as it extends

northwards, comes out at the eastern terniination of the Cromer coast section at

Eccles, as the well-known Contorted Drift of that coast, from whence it extends

continuously, and as the uppermost bed of the cliff (except the sand cappings) to

Wej'bourne. The authors state that they have traced it from its attenuated com-
mencement in the north-east of Suffolk and south-east of Norfolk in every direc-

tion northwards, and found it at Cargate Green, near Acle (ten miles only south of

malian remains beneath the Middle Glacial sands at Kessinglaiid Cliff in Suffolk, seems,

the Cromer coast), overlain by tlie great Boiilder-clay (or Upper Glacial), and at
West Somerton (seven miles' soutli-east of the Eccles termination of tire coast
section) overlain by Middle Glacial sand, and that again by the great Bonlder-clay
in direct superposition. In its brick-earth condition it is sometimes full of small
stones, occasionally also of minute chalk fragments, and often contains large sand-
galls. In the direction of Weybourne this deposit becomes more marly by the in-
termixture of fine chalk sediment; and west of Mundesley, at which place it
begins to be contorted, gi-eat masses of pure white marl or reconstructed Chalk
(which have been described as chalk-masses l)y observers) occur in it, which, by
the weight of the bergs carrying them, have sunk in some cases into the subjacent
TiU, and even into the Weybourne sand. These marl-masses the authors describe
as being detached fragments from the more inland portion of the Contorted Drift
itself; which, inland from the coast, both southwards towards Eeepham and

Holt, and westwards towards Wells, becomes formed exclusively of this marl.
They attribute the formation of this marly portion of the Contorted Drift to a dis-
charge of gi-ound-up ChaUi fi-om the debouchure of a glacier that occupied the

Chalk country of Cambridgeshire and West Suflblk ; the brick-earth which forms

the easterly development of the Contorted Drift being due to a river discharge in
that part, the two sediments intermingling in the intermediate area, and pro-

ducing the alternations of marl and brick-earth there presented by this formation.

The detached ma.sses of the marl were, they consider, introduced into the brick-
earth portion of the deposit by the agency of bergs, which, breaking from the
glacier and grounding, picked up masses of the marl forming over the sea-bottom
in that part of the area. These masses the bergs caii-ied out into the area where
the brick-earth was accunudating, and groimding again, imbedded them in the
brick-earth, and even in the subjacent Till and Weybourne sand, contorting the
beds in the process. From detached porrious of this marl, which they have found
as far south as Claydon, near Ipswich, and Stanstead, near Lavenham, in Suffolk,
they infer that this deposit covered the west of Suffolk and Norfolk, but imder-

went great denudation in the former part by the waters of the Middle Glacial seas,
the sands of that sea, west and south of Diss, lying up to bosses of it in some parts,

and overlying it in others.

That the fauna of the Lower Glacial beds is marked by the disappearance of all

except the boreal and arctic moUusca of the Crag, rather than by the introduction
Aof a new faima, the principal introduction being the Tellinn solkhtla.
                                                                         list of

twenty-eight species of moUusca was given by the authors from these Lower Glacial

beds.

   That the sands and gravels, attaining frequently a thickness of fifty or sixty feet,
which underlie much of the great Boulder-clay in the six coimties before men-
tioned, and which, termed by the authors the Middle Glacial, pass over the Lower
Glacial series, a,b, c,and p, just described, contain a molluscan faima, of which they
enumerate twenty-three species. The interest attaching to this fauna consists in the
fact that Pectimadvs (/h/ciweris, which dies out in the newer part of the Eed Crag,

and is excessively rare in the Fluviomarine or true Norwich Crag, returned during
this formation in abundance, as well as Ostrea eduUs, a shell which similarly dis-

ajjpears in the newer beds of the Crag, and it is not known now within the Arctic

circle. Although a bed, a few feet thick, of Boulder-clay identical in composition

with the gTeat Boulder-clay, but of very limited extent, occurs at the base of this

formation at two places in north-east Suffolk, and at one place in Hertfordshire,
its features and fauna both appear to indicate that some considerable amelioration of
the very severe climate to which the marl of the Contorted Drift that preceded it
was due, occurred in the interval occupied by this formation.

   That the true '\\-idespread Boulder-clay of the east of England, termed by tlie
authors the Upper Glacial, ceases from denudation in northern Norfolk, along a
line drawn from Winterton on the north-east coast to Norwich, and thence passing
near Aylsham through Cawstou, Gucstwick, and Barney, to a point a little north
of Fakenliam. On the east of the county (that is to say, to the south-east of a
line joining Norwich and Happisburgh) the Middle Glacial sand and the under-
lying Contorted Drift crop out from beneatli the true Boidder-clay in regular
sequence ; but over the centre of Norfollc the authors describe a very anomalous

structure, whieli is that the true Boulder-clay (or Upper Glacial) has been depo-
sited in a great trough more than t-sveuty miles wide, which has been excavated
through the Middle Glacial sands and subjacent Lower Glacial beds down to the
Chalk. The efl'ect of this has been to bring the true Boulder-clay (or Upper Gla-
cial), resting on the Chalk, down to a level on the west and south-west of Nor-
wich, which in some parts is below that of the Crag, and nearly 100 feet below
the position which it occupies when resting on the older Glacial beds in undis-
turbed sequence of deposit, the Chalk iipon which the Upper Glacial thus rests

direct being generally in a glaciated or disturbed condition.

   That over the central part of Norfolk, where the Upper Glacial thus goes down
in solid mass to the Chalk, it is overspread by extensive beds of Postglacial
gravel*, which not only cap the plateaux, but spread over the sides of the valleys,
sometimes forming a continuous wrapping sheet down to their bottoms, and pre-

senting a general absence of teiTace structure. These featm'es the authors consider
as repugnant to any theory accounting for the excavation of the valleys hj river-

action. Similar old Postglacial gi-avels are also present, but less extensively, in

eastern Norfolk, where they rest on the denuded surfaces of the Upper and Middle
Glacial formations ; large sheets of them capping the former at Poringland, and
the latter at Mousehold Heath.

   That, in addition to these older gi-avels, sheets of a newer gravel, more or less
concealed by the alluvium, occupy the bottoms of most of the river-valleys. This

newer gravel they consider may be the deposits of rivers during the Postglacial

period, and after the valleys had been formed by tidal action.

   The sequence of the beds, omitting the Postglacial, may be summed up as fol-

lows, the beds being taken in descending order :

"Address hy the Rev. M. J. Berkeley, M.A., F.L.S., President of tJie Section.

After alluding to personal matters that had hitherto prevented him from car-

i-ying out his original intention of instituting a course of experiments illustrative
of the theories which have lately been broached by Dr. Hallier and others respect-
ing the origin of cholera and some other formidable diseases, the President pro-

ceeded as follows :

   Few points are of greater significance than those which touch upon the intimate

* In the small map of the Glacial beds of the east of England, printed by one of the

authors for private circulation in 1865, the centre of Norfolk, where these Postglacial

sands and gravels so extensively occur, was represented as principally occupied by the

sands and gi-avels of the Middle Glacial series. This error, which the prosecution of their

work has detected, the authors desire to call to notice.

connexion of animal and vegetable life. Fresh matter is constantly tnniiug- up,
nio?t clsai'ly indicating; that there are oi\ii\xnisnis in the vegetable kingdoni. which
cannot bo distingnished from animals. The curious observations which showed

that the protoplasm of the spores of Sotrytis infestans (the Potatoe mould) is at

times ditfereutiated, and ultimately resolved into active flagelliferous zoospores,
quite undistiuguishable from certain Infusoria, have met their parallel in a memoir

lately published by MM. Famintzin and Boranctzky respecting a similar ditferen-

tiatibn in the goiiidia of Lichens belonging to the genera Plnjscia and C'ladonia.

It is, however, only certain of the gonidia which are so circumstanced ; the contents

of others simply divide into motionless globules.

  A still more "curious fact, if true, is described by De Bary, after Cieukowsky, in

the division of Fungi knovv^n under the name of Myxogastres or false pufi'balls.

Their spores, when germinating, in certain cases give rise to a body not distin-

guishable from Amcebci, though in others the more ordinary mode of germination

prevails. In the first instance De Bary pronounced these productions to belong

to the animal kingdom, so striking was the resemblance ; but in our judgment

he exercised a wise discretion in comprising them amongst vegetables in a late

volume of Hofmeister's 'Handbuch.'

The point, however, to which I wish to draw your attention, and one of great

interest if ultimately confirmed, is that the gelatinous mass produced either inde-

pendently, or by the blending of these Ama-boid bodies, is increased, after the

manner of true Amoeba?, by deriving nourishment from different organisms involved

by accident from the extension of the pseudopodia. These sti-ange bodies, accord-

ing to our author, behave themselves precisely after the same manner as those en-

closed accidentally in undoubted animals. If this be true, it shows a still more

intimate connexion, or even identity of animals and vegetables than any other fact

with which I am acquainted.

You are all doubtless aware of the important part which minute fungi bear in the

Aprocess of fermentation.                                                           very curious contribution to our information on cog-

nate matters has lately been published by Van Tieghem, in which he shows that

tannin is converted into gallic acid by the agency of the mycelium of a species of

Aspergillus, to which he has given the name of 'Asperr/ilhis nir/er. The paper will

be found in a late Number of the ' Annales des Sciences Naturalles,' and is well

worth reading.

  We now come to the subject which I mentioned at the beginning of this address,

viz. the theory of Ilallier respecting the origin of certain diseases. His observa-

tions were at first confined to Asiatic cholera, but he has since made a commu-

nication to the authorities of the Medical Department of the Privy Council

--Office, to the effect that in six other diseases t^'phus, tj'phoid, and measles (in
--the blood), variola, variola ovina, and vaccinia (in the exanthemes) he has

found certain minute particles which he calls micrococci, which imder culture-ex-

periments give, for each of the above-mentioned diseases, a constant and charac-

teristic fungus. He states that in variola he gets the hitherto unknown pycnidia

of Eurotuim  Jicrban'onim                                                           in  vaccinia,                                                                                      Aspcrt/iUtis  f/laiicus,  Lk. ;  in measles, the

in typhoid, Pcnicillimn crustacemn, Fries. He adds that the culture-experiments,

--especially with the variola diseases, have been so very numerous as to exclude from

the results all supposition of accident that different districts, different epidemics,

and different times have given identical results. I am anxious to say a few words

about the subject, jjecause most of the reports which have been published in our

medical journals give too much weight, in my opinion, to his observations, as

though the matter had been brought to a logical conclusion, which is far from

being the case. I am happy to say that it has been talcen up by De Bary, who is so

well calculated to gi^e something like a conclusi\-e answer to the question, and also

that it has been taken in hand by the medical authorities of our army, who are

about to send out two of their most "promising young officers, perfectly unprejudiced,

who will be in close communication both -^ath De Bary and Hallier, so as to make

themseh-es perfect masters of their views, and to investigate afterwards the subject

for themselves.

The fault, as I conceive, of Hallier's treatise is, that while his mode of investi-
           TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                   85

gation is imsatisfactorj', he jumps far too rapidly to his conclusions. It is quite

possible that certain fungi may occur constantly in substances of a certain chemical
or molecular constitution, but this may be merely a case of effect instead of cause.
Besides, as I concei\-e, tlie only safe way of ascertaining what really originates
from such bodies as those which he terms micrococci, or the larger ones commonly

called yeast-globules, is to isolate one or two in a closed cell so constructed that a

pellicle of air, if I may so term it, surrounds the globule of Huid containing the

--bodies in question, into which they may send out their proper fruit a method

which was successful in the case of yeast, which consists of more than one fungus,
and of the little Sderutimn, like grains of gunpowder, which is so common on

onions. Any one who follows the growth of moulds on moist substances, and at

diiferents depths, as paste of wheat or rice-flour, will see that numberless diflerent

modifications are assumed in diflerent parts of the matrix, without, howe-\er, a

perfect identification with fimgi of other genera. Some of these will be seen in

the figures I have given in the ' Intellectual Observer,' and the ' Journal of the
Linnean Society,' of different forms assumed by the moulds to which that for-

midable disease, the fungus foot of India, owes its origin. This is quite a different

order of facts, from the several conditions assumed by the conidiiferous state of

--some of the vesiculiferous moulds as for example Hotrijtis Jonesii, which has

been ascertained to be a conidiiferous state of Mtwor mucedo, while two forms of
fruit occur of the same mould in what is called Ascopliora elei/ans ; or the still more
marvellous modification which some of the Mucors undergo when grown under
water, as evinced by some of the Saprolegnire, the connexion of which was indi-

cated by Cams some fifty years ago, but which has never been fully investigated.
  When Ilallier intimates' that he has raised from cholera evacuations such a para-

site as Urocystis occulta, he should have been content with stating that a form of

fructification occurred resembling, but not idenical with, that fungus. Indeed,

a comparison with authentic specimens of that species, published by Rabenhorst,

under the generic name of Ustilar/o, shows that it is something very different, and

yet tlie notion of cholera being derived from some parasite on the rice-plant rests

very much on the occurrence of this form. Eut even supposing that some Urocystis

(or Poli/ci/stis as the genus is more commonly named) was produced from cholera
evacuations, there is not a particle of evidence to connect this with the rice-plant.
In the enormous collections transmitted by Dr. Curtis from the southern United
States, amounting to 7000 specimens, there is not a single specimen of rice with
any endophytic fungus, and it is the same with collections from the East. Mr.
Thwaites has made very diligent search, and employed others in collecting any

fungi which may occur on rice, and has found nothing more than a small supei-fi-

cial fungus nearly allied to Clacloqwriinn Jicrburum, sullying the giunies exactly

as that cosmopolitan mould stains our cereals in damp weather. Kice is occa-
sionally ergoted, but I can find no other trace of fungi on the grains. Again, when
he talks of TUIetia, or the Wheat Bunt, being derived from the East--supposing

wheat to be a plant of Eastern origin, there is no evidence to_ bear out the asser-

tion, as it occurs on various European grasses ; and there is a distinct species
which preys on wheat in North Carolina, which is totally unknown in the Old

·World.

I might enter further into the matter, were it advisable to do so_ at the present

AUmoment.  I wish, however, is to give a caution against admitting his facts

too implicitly, especially as somewhat similiar views respecting disease have lately

reached us from America, and have become familiar from gaining admittance into a

journal of such wide circulation as 'All the Year Round,' where Hallier's views

are noticed as if his deductions were perfect!}' logical.

The functions of spiral vessels, or of vascular tissue in general, have long been

a subject of much controversy, and few matters are of more consequence as regards
Athe real history of the distributicn of sap in plants.
                                                           very able paper on the

subject, to which allusion was made by Br. Hooker in his address, has been pub-

lished by Mr. Herbert Spencer (than who few enter more profoundly into ques-
tions of physiology) in the Transactions of the Linnean Society. By a line of

close argument and observation he shows, from experiments with coloured fluids

capable of entering the tissues without impairing vitality, and that not only in
86 BEPOHT--1868.

cuttings of plants, but in individuals in wliicli the roots were uninjured, that the sap

not only ascends by the rascular tissue, but that the same tissue acts in its turn as

an absorbent, returning and distributing the sap which has been modified in the

leaves. That this tissue acts some important part is clear from the constancy v\'ith

which it is produced at a very early stage in adventitious buds, establishing a con-

nexion between the tissues of the old and new parts. This appears also from the

manner in which in true parasites a connexion is established between the vascular

tissue of the matrix and its parasite, as shown by our President in his masterly

treatise on Balanophorse, and more recently by Solms-Laubach in an elaborate

memoir in Pringsheim's Journal. It is curious that in organs so closely analogous

to the trachea3 of insects a similar connexion should long since have been pointed

out by Mr. Newport, in the case of certain insect parasites.

  A circumstance, again, which constantly occurs in the diseases of plants confirms

the views of Mr. Ilerbert Spencer. In diseased turnips, grapes, potatoes, &c., it

is especially the vascidar tissue Avhich is tii'st gorged with the ubnates which are

so characteristic of disease.

   Monsieur Casimir De CandoUe, in a clever memoir on the morphology of leaves,

has come to the conclusion, after studying the arrangement of their vascular tissue,

that they are branches in which the side towards the axis, which he calls the pos-

terior, is atrophied. This subject has been followed out in those organs which are

considered as modifications o± leaves, as, for example, stamens, in which he finds

sometimes the posterior .side, sometimes the anterior, atrophied. If his theory

is true, this would result from the waj^ in wliich they originated, and the reference

they bore to contiguous organs. The subject is well worth attention, and may

eventually throw considerable light on those anomalous cases in teratology which

wiU not accommodate themselves to the usual theory of metamoi-phosis. Some of

--these cases are so puzzling and complicated, that a very clever botanist once told

me, " Monstrous flowers teach us nothing," not meaning to abjure all assistance

from them, but simply to indicate that they may be deceptive. Such flowers as

double primroses, and the strange developments on the corollas of some Gloxinias,

may possibly receive their explanation from a careful study of the course of the

vascular tissue. As the colour on the anterior and posterior order in the latter

case is reversed, the doctrine of dedoublement does not at all help us.

Hofmeister, in his ' Handbuch der Pliysiologischen Botanik,' has an important

chapter on free-cell formation, which at the present moment is of gi-eat interest as

connected with Mr. Darwin's doctrine of Pangenesis. Mr. Rainey has showed

that the formation of false cells takes place in the solutions of gum and other sub-

stances                              and  if this  is  the  case  where  no  vital agency is concerned, we  may well
                                  ;

be prepared for the formation of living cells in organizable lymph, or in other

properly constituted matter. The curious cell-formation of Gum Tragacanth may

be an intermediate case. Be tliis, however, as it may, we have examples of free-

cell formation in the formation of nuclei, in the embryos of plants, and above all

in the asci of ascomycetous fungi. In plants whose ceils contain nuclei, new cells

are never formed without the formation of new nuclei, the number of which ex-

actly corresponds with that of the new cells.

   It would 1m unpardonable to finish these somewhat desultory remarks without

--adverting to one of the most interesting subjects of the day, the Darwinian

doctrine of Pangenesis. After the lucid manner, however, in which this doctrine

was explained by Dr. Hooker in his opening address, I should be inclined to omit

it altogether had I not looked at it from a somewhat difttn-ent point of view, so that

I should not be trespassing upon j'our time in going over the same g-rouud. Others,

indeed, as Owen and Ilerbert Spencer, have broached something of the kind, bnt

not to such an extent ; for the Darwinian theory includes atavism, reversion, and

inheritance, and embraces mental peculiarities as well as physical. The whole

matter is at once so complicated, and the theoiy so startling that the mind at first

naturally shrinks from the reception of so bold a statement. Like everything,

however, which comes from the pen of a writer whom I have no hesitation, so far
myas own judgment goes, in considering as by far the greatest observer of oxu* age,

whatever may be thought of his theories when carried out to their extreme results,

the suliject demands a carefid and impartial consideration. Like the doctrine of
                        TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                87

natural selection, it is sure to modify, more or less, our modes of thouglit. Eveu

supposLug- the theory uusound, it is to be observed, as ^Vhewell remarks, as quoted

by our author, " Hypotheses may often be of service to science when they involve

a certain portion of incompleteness, and even error." Mr. Darwin says himself
that he has not made Histology an especial branch of study, and I have therefore
less hesitation, though "impar congressus Achilli," in expressing an individual
opinion that he has laid too much stress on free-cell formation, which is rather the
exception than the rule. Assuming the general truth of the theory, that molecules
endowed with certain attributes are cast off by the component cells of such infini-

tesimal minuteness as to be capable of circulating with the fluids, and in the end to

be present in the unimpreguated embryo-cell and spermatozoid, capable either of

lying dormant or inactive for a time, or, when present in suiRcient potency, of pro-
ducing certain definite effects, it seems to me far more probable that they should

be capable under favourable circumstances of exercising an influence analogous to

that which is exercised by the contents of the pollen-tube or spennatozoid on the

embiyo sac or o^um, than that these particles shovdd be themselves developed into

cells ; and under some such modification I conceive that the theoiy is far more

likely to meet with anything like a general acceptation. Be this, however, as it

Wemay, its comprehensiveness \vill still remain the same.          must still take it as a

compendium of an enormous mass of facts, comprised in the most marvellous man-

ner within an extremely narrow compass.

1 shall venture to offer a very few words in conclusion, which perhaps may be

thought to have too theological an aspect for the present occasion.

It is obvious how open such a theory is to the charge of materialism. It is an

undoubted fact, however, that mental peculiarities and endowments, together with

mere habits, are handed down and subject to the same laws of reversion, atavism,

and inheritance as mere structural accidents, and there must be some reason for

one class of facts  as  well  as  the  other                       and whatever the explanation may be, the
                                                                ;

Wehand of God is equally visible and equally essential in all.     cannot now refer

evciy indication of thought and reasoning beyond tlie pale of humanity to blind

instinct, as was once the fashion, from a fear of the inferences which 'might be

made. Should any one, however, be still afraid of any theory like that before us,

I would suggest that man is represented in Scripture as differing from the other

members of the animal world, by possessing a spirit as well as a reasoning mind.

The distinction between i/'ux'V and Trv(Vfj.a, which is recognized bj'the Germans in

their familar words secle and (/ist, but wliich we have no words in our language *

to express properly, 3r in other terms between mere mental powers which the rest
of the creation possess in greater or less degree in common with oiu-selves, and an
immortal_ spirit, if rightly weighed, will perhaps lead some to look upon the
matter with less fear and prejudice. Nothing can be more unfair, and I may add

unwise, than to stamp at once this and cognate speculations with the charge of
irreligion. Of this, however, I feel assured that the members of this Association

will conclude with me in bidding this great and conscientious author God-speed,
and join in expressing a hope that his health may be preserved to enrich science
vdth the results of his great powers of mind and unwearied observation.

   There is a peculiar production which grows in the form of small sponge-like
masses on the stems of the larger h}'droids, and is especially abundant on Plu-
mularia falcata and S'ertularia ahietina from deep water.

   For the first published description of it we are indebted to Sir J. G. Dalyell,

wLo, recognizing its hydroid relations, placed it in the genus Sertularia under the

name of <S'. arcta.
   It -was afterwards described by Dr. Hassall, who insisted, with reason, on i(s

claims to constitute the type of a uew genus, to T\hich he gave the name of

Cnppinia.

  The Coppinia arcta is now familiar to every student of tlie Plydroida, but some

of the most interesting points in its structure have been entirely overlooked, and

we do not possess even a correct diagnosis of its genus.
   The two principal portions which, even on a superficial inspection, arc setn to

enter into the composition of the hydroid have been recognized h\ Dalycll and

others. These consist (T) of a continuous basal incrusting portion, and (2) of more
or less curved cylindrical tidies, which project from the free surface of the incrust-
ing portion. It has farther been shown that these tubes contain each a hydi'anlh

provided, in some cases at least, with a verticil of tentacles surrounding the base
of a short hypostome, and in such cases capable of protrusion from the tube and
of retraction within it. The tubes are thus true hj'droiheca:'. The hydranths are
conspicuous by their fine lemon-yellow colour.

   The incrusting base, however, has been entirely uiisundtrstood, and yet its
structure is full of interest. The hydrothecal tubes can be traced through it to
its attached surface, while vertical and transverse sections show that the rest of
the crust is composed of vertical chitinous tubes rendered pelygoual by nmtual
pressure. They adhere to one another by their sides, and each opens on the free
surface of the crust by a small circular oriiiee, which had been already poiuted out

by Dalyell.

These tubes are true gonangia. "SVithin each is a solitary gonosac which buds

apparently from a blastostyle, which, however, has been more or less suppressed

Aby the growing gonosac.  sufficiently obvious spadix may be recognized in the

gonosac, and between it and the walls of the female gonosac lies a single large

lemon-yellow ovum. In this ovum, during its earlier stages, may be seen a di-

stinct germinal vesicle, in which the place of the germinal spot is occupied by

numerous clear spherical bodies, which disappear in a few seconds after the ovum

is liberated from the gonosac and exposed to the infiuence of the surrounding

"water.

   Segmentation commences while the ovum is still Avithin the gonosac, and the
ovum becomes thereby converted into a granular plastic mass, which is now forced

out through the orifice in tlie suinmit of tlic gonangiuni. It carries out with it,
however, a hernial extension of the attenuated walls of the gonosac, which form
for it an acrocyst, in which it remains still for some time confined. It ultimately,

by the rupture of the acrocyst, escapes as a planula into the surrounding water.
The planula and its developnunt into a hydranth included in a chitinous tube
have been observed bj' Dalyell.

Both hydrothecre and gonangia spring from an adherent tubular and anasto-

mosing fibre, without the intervention of a distinct hydrocaulus.

  A knowledge of the structiue of C'uppinia arda wUl enable us to give a more

correct generic diagnosis than was possible as long as we were ignorant of the true

nature of this curious hj'droid. The following may be taken as expressing the

essential characters of the genus :

  --Trophosonw. Hydrocaulus absent ; hydrothecfo tubiform, sessile upon an ad-

herent retiform hydrorhiza, and having their proximal extremities plunged into

the  mass of  the incrusting gonosome                                                                                               hydranths with a  single verticil  of filiform

A few wlieelbaiTows full of soil were gathered from the garden generallj' in order

to make a hot-bed, and covered with a glass frame. The heat was communi-

cated by a flue, and shorth^ after the bed was formed, and before any seeds were
so'wn in it, plants of the En/simum oricntalc began to spring uj) in considerable
numbers, apparently developed by the heat of the line. None appeared elsewhere
in the garden, although the summer was unusually warm. From whate'^'er sources

the seed came, it would seem that in this locality more heat than the summer

aflbrded was necessai-y to their germination in Scotland, where this is the first

Arecorded instance of its appearance.  specimen in flower and seed was forwarded

to Professor Balfour for exhibition.

Nvtke of the Occurrence of Hieracium coUimira (Fries) in ScR-irlsJiire, with
   Memarls on some recent Additions to the Scottish Flora. Bij Professor

Balfoxje, M.D., F.R.S.

The author gave an account of some recent additions to the Scottish flora. He

stated that Hieracium cuUinum (Fries) had been gathered in June last on the

banks of tlie Ettrick, between Selkirk and Philiphaugh. This jilant belongs to

a section of the genus Hieracium, not previously represented in Britain. The plant

was CA-idently in a wild station. The author gave a description of the species, and

Heexliil)ited specimens.  also noticed the occurrence of 3Iedicaf/o clenticulata at

Dumfries and Melrose. This plant had not been recorded previously as a Scotch

plant. Among other new Scotch plants exhibited were Pohjcurpon tetraphyllum,

Irom the neighbourhood of Melrose, and a peculiar form of Luzula from the vicinity

of Peebles. He stated that Xunthium spina lun was becoming naturalized iu

many places.

llemarlcs on the Properties of Atropa rhomboidea (Hooler), in Connexion

     with its Botcmiccd Character. By Professor Balfour, M.D., F.R.S.

   The author exhibited fresh specimens of a ]>lant which had been cultivated for
many years in the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, under the name of Atropa
rhumhoidca (Hook.). It was discovered by Gillies at Buenos Ayres, and i.s figured
in Hooker's ' Botanical ^liscellany,' vol. i. The plant is herbaceous, leaves pube-

scent, rhomboidally oval, blimt peduncles 1-flowered, cernnons; festivation of the
                                                                                                                                                                           ;

corolla induplicate ; anthers subexserted ; embryo spirally curved. The stamens are
higher up in the tube of the corolla than in Atropa JJeUadonna, and the inside of
the tube of the corolla and the middle of the style have a belt of woolly hair.
The flowers are small, of a greenish-yellow hue. The plant does not appear to be
truly Atroi^aceous. It wants the imbricate lestivation of tliat order. Moreover,
it was found that the juice of the plant had no power of causing dilatation of the
pupil, which may be said to be characteristic of Atropas. In these circumstances
the author was disposed to think that further examination of the plant was neces-

sary.

               On Arboriculture as a Science. By William Beown.

   After referring to what he advanced on the same subject at Dimdee last year,
the author said that the practical observer and man of science agree in the belief
that man, to a great extent, can control and regulate certain climatic agencies.

He quoted Sir John Herschel in attestation of this, showing that it is in man's

selection of the kind of vegetation that such influences are perceptible. The gist of
Mr. Brown's argument last year was that, by a proper distribution of variously-
sized plantations, man may come to suit, in degree, the climate to the plant, and
not so much the plant to the climate, as he must do in present circumstances.
Reference was also )uade to Mr. Symons's paper in I860, on the Rainfall of the

--British Isles ; and it was shown that, narrow as Britain is, its climate is materially

influenced by local causes these causes having respect to the area of surface occu-

pied by trees. It is sometimes said, " Give me a good soil, and I will produce

abundant crops ; " but this sole condition as to quality of soil is not enough for a
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

favourable climate is even more important than a rich soil. It is a fact that, as
regards the primitive soil, there is no diSerence betwixt the slopes of the Himalaya
(where the Deodar and broad-leaved oak luxuriate) and a great part of Scotland,
the soil in each case being principallj^ from granite and mica-schist. The succes-
sion of pine to oak, or beach to pine, in indigenous forests, has no doubt depended
more on changes of temperature than any other phj'sical cause. The author then
showed that the geographical distribution of rain cannot meet the requirements of
all parts of a country, and thus the need of those modifying circumstances which

man can command being brought into play ; for while it is beyond his power to in-
terfere with the periodicity of events, to modify them certainly is not. Mr. Symons
aclaiowledges that " rainfall records evince a regulaiity not before expected." The
observations of half a century make it clear that the rainfall of these isles is, for
all practical or general purposes, a regidar oue. The present extent under wood in
Great Britain would make a belt two miles broad all round the coast, which

seems large, and might suffice both for health, shelter, and climatic uses, but it is
not distributed to suit the diiferent requirements of districts. Until this is done it

is perfectly plain we will never secure adaptable climates, or make meteorology

practically useful. But with the knowledge of these two facts (the general regu-
larity of rainfall, and that local irregularities are governed mainly by local injluences),

are we still to carry on the same plan of observing, recording, and deducing ? Is
it not time to amend our covu'se of procedure in relation to atmospheric science ?
The author proposed that a set of direct experiments should be established to test
the deductions drawn fi'om the general ones, which, if projierly conducted, would
doubtless lead to important results, and woidd at once \&y the foundation for a

--new era in the history of our rural economy. The question which he set before

meteorologists was at certain geographical positions, exposures, altitudes, and on
certain geological formations, with and without artificial drainage, to what extent,
and in what way, do trees and other vegetation exert their influences? The
author concluded his paper by claiming for arboricidture a more prominent place
under botany in connexion with the Association.

          On the Progress of Oyster and Salmon Cultivation in England.

                                  By Pkank Buckland.

   The author stated that, in his oflicial capacity as Inspector of Salmon Fisheries,
he had lately visited most of the rivers of England and Wales. The supply of
salmon had been much increased owing to the protection of the Acts of Parlia-
ment. Still there remained much to be done. lie complained bitterly of the im-
pediments caused by weirs, which prevented the parent salmon ascending to the
spawning-grounds. The author instanced Diglis weir, which was the " hall door"
TKANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                            91

of the great Severn ; Cliesier weir, that blocked the Dee ; Tadcaster weir, on the
Wharfe, &c. Besides these large weirs, there were mill-weirs innumerable on
most salmon rivers which would otherwise be highly productive. The study of

salmon-ladders was of the greatest importance. He exhibited several models of

ladders which might be applied to weirs at a reasonable cost, and without inter-
fering with the water supply. The question of pollutions was a very serious one,

not only for the fish, but also for the public health. He instanced the Dovey, the

Tees, tiie South Tyne, &c., which were suffering under "hush" from the lead
mines ; the Fowey,"the Camel, &c., which suiiered from the debris of China-clay
works and other mines ; and he deprecated the habit of allowing chloride of lime
to run into the rivers. Paper-makers were gTeat culprits in this matter. The law

of pollutions should be made much stronger. He earnestly requested the attention

of the Section to the question of "close time'' for salmon, as the evidence went
to show that the Welsh, Cornish, and Devonshire rivers were "later rivers" than
the Severn, Dee, Tay, Wye, &c. Mr. Buckland then expounded his theory as to
the cause of tlie failure of oysters for the last six years. The cause of the success

this year, he considered, was warm weather and tranquil water. He had pub-

lished, in ' Land and Water,' temperatures taken daily, during the mouths of J une,
July, and August, at five different oyster fisheries. The results, he thought, con-

firmed his theory. He had obtained a heavy fall of spat at his experimental
fisheiy at Eeculvers, near Heme Bay. There had also been a fall of spat in the
rivers Crouce, Roach, and on the grounds of the Heme Bay Oyster Company, but

he believed that the Colne and the Blackwater had not been so favoured. The author
called the attention of the public to his " Sluseum of Economic Fish Culture,"

at the Horticidtural Gardens, Kensington. The author had hatched and sent
away to different rivers nearly 40,000 salmon and tiout last year ; and in his col-
lection would be found models, coloured casts of most of the economic fish, fishing-
nets, and other implements connected with the improvement of British fisheries,
as well as a series showing the growth, de^-elopmeut, and natural history of

oysters. Samples of oysters from nearly all the British oyster fisheries were also

 exhibited.

On the Distribution of the principal Timber Trees of India, and the progress

                of Forest Conservancy. By Dr. Hu&n Cleghoen.

  When the British Association met at Edinburgh in 1850, a committee* was

appointed to consider " the probable effects, in an economical and phy,sical point
of view, of the destruction of ti-opical forests." Their report was presented in
1851 at Ipswich, and is printed in tlie volume for that year. Attention was thus
directed in India to the importance of preserving eveiy influence which tends to
maintain an eqiulibriuni of temperature and humidity, of preventing the waste of
valuable material, and the special application to their various uses of the indi-

genous timbers of tlie country-.

  A Bmmahfew years later, forest establishments were sanctioned in British

(1855), and in the Madras Presidency (1856); and in 1804 Government laid the
fotmdation of an improved general system of forest administration for the whole
Indian Empire, having for its object the conservation of state forests, and the deve-
lopment of this source of national wealth. The appointment of Inspector -General

of Forests was made, and it is now held by Dr. D. Brandis, formerly the able con-

servator in British Burmah.

   The executive arrangements were left to the local administrations, general princi-
ples being laid down, the most important of which is that all superior Govern-
ment forests are reseiwed and made inalienable, and their boundaries marked out
to distinguish them from waste lands available for the public. Act 7 of 1864, de-
fining the nature of forest rules and penalties, has been adopted by most of the local

Governments.

distribution of the more valuable trees, tbe rate of growth, and the normal yield of

the forests.

  --Benf/al. In British Sikkim and the Dooars of Bootan there are large tracts of

Sal ( Vatica rohusta), not yet surveyed. The produce of these forests is required

for any extension of the Eastern Bengal Railway which may be determined upon,
and for the doubhng of the East India line now in progress. In the Darjiling dis-

trict the higher slopes above 6000 feet have been reserved, and plautations^both
of temperate and subtropical trees ha-^-e been formed. In the Terai several thou-

--sand mahogany trees have been planted out raised partly from seed naturalized

at the Calcutta Botanic Garden, and partly from seed recei^-ed from the West

Indies through the Colonial Office and Dr. Hooker, Director of the Koyal Gardens,
Ivew. In Bengal the department had for two years the great advantage of being

                                            _

supervised by Dr. Thomas Anderson, whose botanical knowledge was of special

--value in the- exploration of the little-known forests in Sikldm and Bootan.
   North- West Provinces. The recent surveys have added much to our knowledge
of the forest resources of the north-west provinces. In Kuniaon and Gurhwal the

areasurveyed is about 400,000 acres ; a large part of tliis is covered with Pinus

hiif/lfolia, bearing an average of fifteen trees per acre. The Himalayan Box is plenti-
ful in certain localities, and has come into use in the schools of art for wood
engraving. The Goruckpore forests cover 120,000 acres, and consist mainly of

Sill ( Vatica rohusta), with an average of twenty-five well-grown trees to the acre.
   The northern limit of indigenous Teak is in Bundlekhund ; it has been planted

in the Punjab, but in that dry climate it is poor and stunted. The management

of the forests of the north-west provinces is second in importance only to that of
Burmah.

  --Oudh. From the survey in Oudh it appears that more than half of the Govern-

ment forest consists of Sal ; the other reserved woods of greatest value are Sissoo
{Dalbergia Sissoo), Toon (C'edrela Toona), and Ebony (Diosjn/ros Ehemnn). Con-
siderable sums have been expended in clearing the Sal trees of destructive twining

--plants, particularly Bauliinia Vahlii, Art/yreia speeiosa, and other Conrolvulaceee.
   Punjab. In the Punjab, the forests growing on the banks of the Five Ilivers

have been formed into so many ranges under skilled officers, and timber operations
have been conducted witli more or less success in the intra-montane districts.
Long leases of the Deodar forests, in the territories of the Ilajahs of Chamba and
Bussahir, liave been negotiated. AVood is the onlj' fuel at present available in

quantity for locomotive purposes. Tlie requirement of the railway alone is esti-
mated at 50,000 tons annually, and the yield of the old skikargahs, or fuel

reserves, being inadequate, skilled management has been brought to aid the in-

creased production of fuel.

   Selected tracts have been trenched and ploughed before planting, and cattle and
camels are strictly excluded. The services of two trained foresters have been se-
cured. The suitability of some Australian trees to tlie arid plains of the Punjab is
remarkable, and se-\-eral species of Acacia, Casvarina, and Eucahjptus have been
tried with apparent success. The nortliern limit of the Sal is on the bank of the
Beas River, in tlie Kangra Valley, but here it is small and stunted.

   Dr. J. L. Stewart is the conservator of the Punjab forests ; he has contributed
some valuable papers to the Journal of the Agricultural and Horticultural Society
of India, as "Tour in Hazara and Khagan," " Flora of the Peshawur Valley," and

--"Bijnour and its Trees."
   Central Provinces. In the csmtral provinces, tlie revenue settlement was pro-
ceeding when the Forest Department was sanctioned, and the demarcation of re-
served tracts took place simultaneously, which was a gi-eat advantage. Six ranges
have been established, and Teak plantations have been commenced on the Taptee
and Nerbudda Rivers, and are to be steadily pursued on the plan of the Conolly

])lantations in Malabar. Two trained foresters from Scotland have been employed

for some time. The attention of the department in this province is directed
equally to Teak and S.al timber. The other reserved woods are Sissoo (Dalhcnjia

--*SVssoo),Saj {Terniinalia fontentusa), and Bijasal {Pterocarpus niuraujAuni).

llydrabad assigned districts. The character of the vegetation resembles that of

the Central Provinces, and tlio same species of trees are reserved. The only Teak

--tract is at Mailghat, north of EUichpore, and it is carefully preserved.
   Mysore. The territories of the Kajah of Mysore have always been famous for

Sandalwood and Teak ; the former occupies a remarlcable belt about 30 or 40 miles

inland from the crest of the Ghats, though tine self-sown patches are dili'used

over the whole tableland. In the adjoining- district of Salem, a considerable

quantity of Sandalwood has lately been discovered in the Collamullj^ and Putcha-

mully Hills, and two small patches occur in South Cauara, but these are at a

lower elevation, and the timber is inferior in quality. The western part of Mysore

is clothed with fine forest, but much has of late given place to coft'ee culture.

Tectona grandis, Dalbcrgia latifolia, and Cahphyllum elatum (Beddome) furnish

--the most valuable timbers.
   Burmah. The progress of forest administration in British Burniah has been

stead}^, with a large increase in the forest revenue. In 18i34:-6-5 nine Teak forests

were demarcated in the Tharawaddee di\'ision ; the aggregate area of these is

about 50 square miles. The necessity and importance of forming plantations is be-

Acoming every year more apparent.  recommendation to plant on a large scale

was made forty years ago by Dr. Wallich, and afterwards by Ur. Heifer. It was

again strongly 'urged by Sir 'A. Phayre and Ur. Brandis, in their joint report of

June 186J:, and planting is now systematically carried out. There are eight Teak

plantations, which are being added to by annual increments, and planted in dif-

ferent ways to test the expense which must be incurred in raising- Teak on a large

scale. The facts recorded in the last report as to the germination of seed from

different localities, and the measurement of growth of young trees, are interesting

for comparison with the results obtained in Malabar and in Java. Further experi-

ence in management is annually gained, and it will be ascertained how far the

same system is applicable to different provinces.

In Arracan, the most valuable timber is the Inga .rylocarpa, termed Ironwood,

from its exceeding hardness. The wood has been found useful for railway sleepers,

--and is exported to Bengal.
   3Iadras. The forests of Madras hare for twelve 3'ears been under the care of a

special department. The most valuable timber is Teak, which is to the south of

India what Deodar is to the nortli, and Sal to the central provinces. Energetic

efforts are being made to restore the woods in this Presidency, and very extensive

plantations are formed, particularly in Malabar and South Canara (Teak), Neil-

gherries {Eucalyptus and Australian Acacia), Cudapah (Red Sanderswood),

Shevaroys (Toon and Teak), and Sigur (Sandalwood). By far the most impor-

tant of these are the Conolly Teak plantations in ilalabar, which are rapidly in-

creasing in value by the growth of the old plantation, and the annual increment

of fresh planting. In 1866-67, 120,000 seedlings were planted out. The consump-

tion of wood for railway fuel is enormous ; a special train laden with wood for

locomotives leaves Coimbatore, and another leaves Cudapah every da}', in addition

to the regular trains taking in wood at fuel stations. The natural jungles, which

have hitherto supplied this large quantity, are in some districts so nearly ex-

hausted that the mere protection of those which now exist will not yield a per-

manent supply. The natural reproduction of the indigenous jungles (where cattle

are excluded) is expected to furnisli a large supply of fuel, but it is further intended

to form plantations for locomotive requirements. These, in accordance with the

instructions of the Secretary of State, are to be under the management of the

Forest Department, and their cost to be a charge in that department. These ope-

rations involve present and prospective outlay, with no returns till after the lapse of

seven or eight years. This important braneli of forest work must increase -with

the extension of railways, and it is hoped that the example set hj Government

may have the effect of stimulating pri^·ate individuals to form similar plantations.

The financial condition of the forest department in Madras is so far satisfactory.

The total net surplus in eleven years, including- the value of timber in store on 30th

March 1867, is £180,000, or from £15,000 to £20,000 a-year. Within the last

few years much has been done in the way of improving forest communications in

remote and difficult places. Major Beddome, at present in charge of the forests,

has done much for science, and is well Icnown by his work on Indian Ferns,

 --Bombay. In the Presidency of Bombay the forest department is of old stand-

ing. Mr. N. A. Dalzell succeeded Dr. GIIdsou, the first conservator, and is an ac-
complished botanist. For some years the receipts have exceeded the expenditm-e
by several lakhs, say, £30,000 annually. The demarcation of reserves in the Decean
has been in progress, and is a most important measure. The administration of the
forests in Sind has received the commendation of Government. The demand for
firewood for large towns, steamboats, and railways has augmented very con-
siderably, showing the absolute necessity of husbanding the resources, so as to
keep up a regular and abundant supply of fuel. Acacia arahica is the tree which

thrives best in Sind, and the timber is much prized for many purposes.
   The importance of continuing the forest surveys and of demarcating the reserved

tracts was urged, and the want of a Flora sijlvatica of India insisted upon.

On some of the Principal Moclijications of the Receptacle, and their Relation
  to the " Insertion " of the Lecf-organs of the Floiuer. By Alexander
   DrcKSON, M.D., Regius Professor of Botany in the University of Glas-

    goiv.

   The author called attention to some of the principal modifications of the recep-
tacle affecting the " insertion" of the leaf-organs of the flower, which may be

classed as follows :

   A. Modifications with superior ovary.
       («) Floral envelopes and stamens hypogynous : ex. Ntiphar, &c.
       (6) Floral envelopes perigVTious (/. e. inserted on a more or less cup-shaped
           exjDansiou of the receptacle) ; stamens hypogj'nous : ex. Passi/lora, &c.

       (c) Floral envelopes and stamens perigynous : ex. Primus, &c.

   B. Modifications with inferior ovary.
       (a) Receptacle not expanded or prolonged beyond the flower ; floral enve-

           lopes and stamens simply epigynous : ex. Hedera, &c.
       (6) Keceptacle expanded beyond ovary as a cup or tube, bearing the floral

         envelopes and stamens, which may here be said to be peri-epigyuous : ex.

    Fuchsia, Victoria, &c.

(c) Receptacle prolonged beyond the ovaiy as a stalk-like process t, expanded
   at its extremity into a small cup which bears the floral envelopes and sta-

  mens, which here may be called hyper-peri-epigynous : ex. Circcca.

id) Floral envelopes simply epigynous. Within these the receptacle is pro-
   longed as a stalk, bearing the stamens and the true style (here almost

  reduced to stigmatic portion) at its extremity. The stamens may be here

           called hyper-epigynous : ex. Stylidium.

      (e) Floral envelopes hypogynous ; stamens epigynous : ex. Nymphaa.
       (/) Calyx hypogynous; corolla and stamens epigynous: ex. Codonopsis

           Experimental Studies on Annular Incisions on Mulberry Trees.

                                 By Professor E. Faivee.

   The following propositions are the result of the experiments which the author
has made for several years :

    1. Annular incisions on mulberry trees produce general or local eifects. The
general eflects consist at first in a greater activity given to the growth above the
parts in which the incision has been made, then in a gradual diminution of the
gTowth, the consequence of which is the destruction of the branches upon which
the operation takes place. The local effects consist

    A. In the alteration of the ligneous layers which have been deprived of the pro-

tective influence of the bark.

    B. In the ordinary production of a reparative "-bourrelet " on the upper lip of
the incision.

    C. In the growth of the branch above the incision.

    D. In the production of shoots more or less vigorous imder the inferior lip of
the incision ; occasionally in the production round this inferior lip of a small

"boiuTelet."

   2. The time in which the incision is made has a great influence on the effects
produced. The reparative tissue and the growth above the incision are essentially
connected with the state of vegetation. If the vegetation is suspended by winter,
no "bourrelet'" is visible, and growth is at a standstill; on the contrary, if the
vegetation is active as in summer, and especially in spring, the formation of the
reparative tissue is easy and rapid. The formation of the "bom-relets," in aU

times of healthy vegetation, testifies to a continuous activity in the circulation of
the sap.

   3. The incision differs in its eflects according as it is made upon the stem or
root, or the young herbaceous shoots or branches of several years' gro^-. th.

   The incision made on the stem causes the destruction of the p..rts situated
above the incision, whilst the incision made on the root destroys the parts above

the incision.

   The "bourrelets" then are situated on the destroyed parts, in the case of stems

or branches, but, on the living parts, in the case of roots.

   The incision made on the root causes a growth of numerous small roots ; this
development (of small roots) has become practically usefid.

   If the branches subjected to incision are young and herbaceous, the formation
of the "bourrelet" is quicker, and the destruction of the superior parts is less
likely than if the operation were performed on ligneous branches.

   These results may l)e practically applied to the propagation of cuttings.
   4. The presence or absence of leaves has great influence upon the formation of a
"bourrelet" and the production of small roots, and on tlie healing of the wound
made by the incision. The absence of leaves produces the absence of a reparative

" bomi-elet."

   Hence the leaves manifestly influence the elaboration and the descent of sap, to
which the formation of a "bourrelet" is due. The influence of the leaves on the
nutrition of the roots is an important and practical consequence on the aforesaid '

facts.

   ·5. The age of the branch operated on, and the depth of the incision, modify

remarkably the results of the operation. If one operates on a .small ligneous branch
of two or more years' growth, on the removal of the surrounding ligneous layers, if

the annulation is made in the summer, the leaves fade in one or two dajs, the
branch dies, and no " bourrelet" can be formed. If one operates in the same man-
--90 REPORT 1868.

iier on an herbaceous slioot, the operation is not fatal, the leaves continue health j%
the part of the branch above the incision survives a long- time, and a '· bourr.>let"

may be produced.
   The author has, by experiment, established that these diflerent results are due

to the ascent of sap through all the ligneous layers in the herbaceous shoots, and
only through the exterior layers in shoots of two j'ears or more.

   G. The positions given to the incision have a real influence on the consequent
physiological phenomena ; thus the partial incisions made, one above the origin of
a )n-anch, another under the origin of a branch (i. e. if subject to the same condi-
tions), cause in one branch the formation of a voluminous "bourrelet" on the
superior lip of an annulation made above the first incision : in the other branch, if
the incision is made under the origin of the branch, the "bourrelet" is scarcely

visible.

Experiments already made on this subject indicate an evident relation between

the ascent and descent of sap with respect to the Cjuantity and the movements.

7. The nature of the matter with which the wound made by the incision is covered

has an influence upon its healing. In apphang the mastic emplo^'ed in grafting,

either to the branches in a normal state or to the cuttings, we have discovered

that it quickens the vegetative power in the branches, and prolongs it, but does

not ensure their preservation.  India-rubber acts  more eiHcaciously                                                                                    it accelerates
                                                                                                                                                     ;

considerably the formation of the reparative tissue, and its use might be recom-

mended in horticultiU'C.

8. The starting-point of the effects of annular incision is the alteration of the

ligneous layers exposed to the air and to evaporation, in consequence of the re-

moval of the bark. The ascent of the sap can no longer take place through the

wounded tissues, hence the leaves fade, the course of the descending sap is im-

peded, and Anally suspended ; consequently the formation of the reparative tissue
becomes impossible. Such is the mechanism which seems to the author to explain

more rationally the facts, at any rate, concerning stems and small branches.

On a new British Moss, Hypnum Bambergeri. Bi/Jokn Feasee, 21. A., M.D.

One day towards the end of July 1867, while botanizing on Ben I^awers, the

author foimd a moss which appeared to be new. It was afterwards submitted to

Mr. "Wilson of Warrington, Mr. G. E. Hunt of Manchester, Dr. Braithwaite, and

whomothers, all of  were satisfied that it had not previously been observed in this

country. It was the Hj/pmim Bamhergeri of Schimper, which was discovered by

Bamberger on the Stockhorn, Switzerland, afterwards on the Bavarian Alps, and

in Norway. It was found by the author, not on low swampy ground, as might

have been expected, but high up among the broken rocks, near the summit of the

moimtain. Its range appears to be from 3500 to 7000 feet, and its position in the

genus Jli/pnuin between //. impotu-ns and //. callichroum.

 --The following is a pretty correct description of it: It occurs in rather small

dense tufts, yellowish-green above, passing to yellow fuscous at the base ; stem

withotit radicles, subpinnate, with a few fastigiate branches; leaves densely

crowded, secuud, strongly circinnate, ovato-lanceolate, elongated, entire, with a

long ovate point ; nerves two, faint, one usually longer than the other ; alar cells

few, rather obscure, yellow, upper ones linear, elongate, pale ; fruit unknown, but

female flowers not unfrequent.

                                      B>/ Eor.EET Gaexer, F.L.S.

   Amongst a parcel of Cephalopoda from Sardinia occurred a specimen of a male
animal which the author thought possessed some interest. Were one not aware
that the male Argonaut is a very diminutive animal, and also the curious process
bj' which the eggs of the female are fertilized, one might have set down the
specimen in question as the male of that moUusk. This cannot well be done, and
therefore the author supposed it to be a species of Tremoctopus, and, indeed, it had
aquiferous pores, at the base of the lowest arms or feet, leading into cavities above
                            TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                97

tlie eyes. Of one species of Tremoctopus the male is known, diminutive like that

of the Argonaut. The colour, spots, and texture in the specimen in question were

the same as in the female Arg-onaut ; whilst the aliform appendages to the feet,
and the shape of the body moulded somewhat to the shell, were characters want-

ing in the specimen, but present in the Ai-gonaut. It was no Octopus ; it had,

like the Argonaut, a very perfect mechanical arrangement at the base of the siphon

for the inlet and exit of the water in respiration and progression; sockets to

receive prominences within the margin of the mantle or sac, and the sockets them-

selves with cartilaginous hooks at the lower part to lock the mantle to them. The

lingual ribbon was that of the Argonaut, not of the Octopus. Tlie eyes and their
lids or membranous coverings (which differ much in the whole tribe) were like those

of the Argonaut, consisting of two crescentic portions of skin overlapping. There

were not the little side cartilages to be found in Octopus or its .ally Eledone ; there
were appendages to the branchial hearts absent in Octopus according to Cuvier,

but not in Eledone, and not wanting in Argonaut ; and lastly, there were two

genital pores in the animal in question, though there is only one in the male Oc-

topus                       and the excretory ducts were not complicated  and  glandular in the former,
                         ;

whilst the single one is so in the latter. In fact the internal anatomy is in every

respect the same in the specimen described as in the Argonaut. If a male Tre-

moctopus, the two genera must be v(>ry nearly allied. The stomach contained

conical shells of Pteropoda, lingual spines of moUusks, and portions of the eyes of

cuttles and fishes, such fragments as are commonly found in the stomach of the

Argonaut. In the same parcel was a small Ai-gonaut in its shell, which was less

than three inches in length, but had a mass of ova in the spire, over which the

winged arms were folded, and around them the fine extremities of the next pair of

arms curled. In the ovaries of this and of another larger specimen, the author

noticed a few threadlike bodies, an inch and a half long, tapering behind, and

having a hair-like portion at the blunter extremity ; he supposes these to be en-

tozoa. Sepiola Aflantica occurred with the other Cephalopoda, therefore it is not

exclusively an Atlantic species it has eye-pores leading to the subocular glands.
                                                                                                                                                                          ;

Hossia microsoina also occurred, its internal structure differing in nothing from the

last. In both there is a clear membrane stretched over the eye with only a slight

duplicature before and below ; the ink-bag is somewhat quadrate in form, with

two attached glands. There was a young and an old specimen of Ommastrephes

todarus : in this species the tentacles are evidently not retractile ; the eyeball is

much exposed, having a large spade-shaped opening in the integument in front of
the lens, whilst in Lolir/o it is covered over completely by a clear membrane ; the

pits at the base of the funnel are triangular, not linear as in Lolir/o media, which

also occurred as a Sardinian species Eledone cirrhosus and Octopus vulgaris com-
                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

plete the list of species. In both these the anterior chamber of the eye seems

closed by an anterior, thicker, and posterior clear crescentic fold. Almost all

Cephalopoda have ducts from the subocular gland opening externally, and

very often other pores opening from cavities about the head.

The author, after describing the geographical situation of Norfolk as being

especially favourable to the production of this class of animals, proceeded to notice

what pre\ious accounts relating to this subject had been placed on record by

various authors. After briefly describing the valuable products of the fisheries as

giving employment to a great proportion of the population near the coast, and

noticing the subject of the whitebait and sprat, he proceeded to more fully de-

scribe the occurrence of the principal rarities, commencing with the accounts of

Sir Thomas Browne, and noticing the fact that some species, apparently rare in

his time, are now of common occurrence, instancing as familiar examples the two

species, the lunip-sucker and laniprev. Amongst the rarities enumerated are the

meous and sordid dragouetts, ancliovy, Ray's bream, plain bonito, opah, blue and
fox-sharks, hammer-headed shark, sawhsh, flj'ingfish, and many others. Of the ham-
mer-headed shark, the head of the only specimen obtained in Europe of late years
is now preserved in the Xor-viach Museum, and a single specimen of the sawfish
was obtained off Lynn, in the time of Sir T. Browne, this being apparently the
only instance ou record of the occurrence of this species in the British seas. The

flying-fish, Exocetus volitans, have on several occasions been observed in the British

seas, and in about three instances have been captured, the last capture being off
Yarmouth this last season ; one of the pectoral fins of this specimen (now in the

author's possession) was exhibited at the reading of this paper.

   He next enumerated some singular malformed varieties, viz. double-headed had-

dock, whiting w\\\\ three eyes, and a malformed basse.

  A brief account of the river-fish, with remarks on some varieties of sticklebacks,

   The total number of species enumerated is 123, leaving a reasonable hope that
when the subject is more fully investigated several further additions may be made

to the Norfolk list.

On the possible introduction of South European Plants in the Vest and South
                   of Ireland. By Professor Hennesst, F.B.S.

The author's inquiries into the climatology of the British Islands had led him to

examine the physical conditions which aftect the distribution of vital phenomena

in Ireland. So far back as 1860 he had already caUed attention to the relations

between the peculiar distribution of the flora in the western districts of Ireland

and the position of the isothermal lines in the map which he had previously pub-

lished*. These relations have been pointed out more recently, and with more pre-

cision, in the map appended to a paper by Dr. David Moore and ]Mr. A. G. More,
"On the Climate, Flora, and Crops of Ireland," in the Report of the International

Horticultural Exhibition and Botanical Congress, held in London during May 1866.

The author briefly presented geological and geographical grounds for rejecting the

hypothesis of the late eminent naturalist, Professor £. Forbes, and he also adduced

similar criticisms from other inquirers f.

   The author next presented a summary of all the South European plants found

in the West and South-west of Ireland, specifying minutely their localities both in

Ireland and on the Continent. The former are limited to two coast districts bor-

dered by numerous navigable inlets and fishing-grounds ; namely, first among the

maritime baronies of the cormties of Galway and JNlayo ; and secondly, a part of
Kerry, together with the south-western exti-emity of Cork. On the Continent

the plants in question are abundantly found, as already remai-ked by Forbes, in

the northern part of Spain, and especially the province of Astiu-ias. " The author

calls these plants, for brevity, the Asturiau flora ; and the two districts where

they are found in Ireland, the West Asturian and South-West Astmian districts,

respectively. It has been admitted by Forbes that there does not seem to be

evidence of any local assemblage of animals in these districts corresponding to

the Asturiau flora, and the inquiry is therefore entirely limited to discover the

origin of the plants. The physical conditions accompanj-ing the gTowth of the

Asturian flora, both in Spain and in Ireland, are fully discussed. The climate of

the province of Asturias is characterized b}^ great moisture and a mild winter tem-

perature                                         thus, at 0\-iedo, which is about the centre of the province, the mean an-
                                              ;

nual fall of rain is nearly 75 inches, and the wettest months are April and May.

The mean annual temperature is 55°--i F. ; the mean winter temperature, from

45°-4                           the mean simimer temperatm-e is QS'-2 ;  the mean  vearly maximum is 88°
                             ;

the soil is said to be generally retentive of moisture. Although the geology of the
other provincess in the North of Spain is in some respects essentially different, there

are good grounds for believing that their climate is similar to that of the Asturias.

When -we turn to the Astui-ian districts of Ireland, we lind more features of geolo-

gical and physical resemblance to the North of Spain than in any other districts of
equal area in Ireland. The infiuence of climate, which seems of paramoimt impor-
tance in relation to plants, is very remarkable in the Lish Asturian districts. The
author illustrated his views by reference to a Map, on which were projected the iso-
thermal lines of mean annual and mean winter temperature for Ii'eland. These lines

were dra\^Ti by the aid of observations made at some new stations, in addition to
those on which he had to rely when projecting the isothermals already published.
Among these stations he especially referred to Galway, fi-om its position in the West
Asturian district. From the Map, it appears that the greater part of the areas of

both of the Asturian districts lie between the annual isothermals of 52° and 51°, and
between the winter isothermals of 45° and 44°. These are the lines of highest tem-
perature in Ireland, and the winter lines correspond almost identically with those

belonging to the middle of the province of Asturias itself. On the other hand, the
summer temperature of the Irish Asturian districts is from 57°'5 to 59°'3 respec-

tively, and therefore from 6° to 8° lower than that of the North of Spain ; whence

it follows that if plants were introduced into an Asturian district from Spain,

some of which required a warm summer, while others required only a mild winter,

the former would die, while the latter might survive, and even spread over exten-
sive areas. The condition of great summer warmth seems to be especially required
for annuals belonging to southern climes, as the ripening of the seeds woidd be in-
evitably checked by a single cold and wet summer. The growth of perennials ap-

pears to depend principally on the condition of winter temperature, as these plants

may spread by roots and suckers. After referring to the generally admitted fact

of the moisture of the climate of Ireland, the author concludes, fi'om observations

made at Galway, Innishgort, in Clew Bay, and Lough Oon-ib, that the annual rain-
fall in the West Astmian district must at least exceed 50 inches ; while observa-
tions made at ^'alentia, Killarney, Gahirciveen, and Castletownsend show that the

fall is probably still greater in the South-west district.

   Corresponding conditions exist with regard to the relative humidity of the air.
If, as before supposed, different varieties of plants from a southern clime were by
accident introduced into our Astmian districts, for some of which moisture was
more favourable than to others, the fonner would have a far greater chance of be-
coming widely spread, while the gTOwth of the latter might be checked instead of

being promoted.

   The infiuence of cultivation in promoting or checking the inti-oduction of wild
plants into the Asturian districts was next discussed. It appears from returns fur-

nished to the Registrar-General of Ireland during five years, that the greatest pro-

portion of weedy groimd was observed in the Asturian districts ; and from returns
made during several years of the relative areas under tillage, pasturage, and in a
totally uncidtivated condition, that the Asturian districts were the lowest in general
cultivation among districts of equal extent.

   Although annuals and the class of weeds generally accompanying crops are at
first favoured by cidture, which opens the soil for their propagation, it seems that
the tranquil development of perennial wild plants takes place most completely
where culture is imperfect or entirely suspended ; whence it follows that if any
perennial wild plants suited by their habits to the Asturian district happened to be
introduced into them, their chance of existing and spreading would be greater than
in other districts of Ireland. In addition to the evidence furnished by the returns
of the Registrar-General, the author referred to the wi-itings of ^Vrthur Young, and
to the Agricultural Smweys of the counties of Ireland, in order to show that the
same relative condition of the Astm-iau districts with reference to cultivation had
been in existence as long as the subject had attracted any notice. It was sho-s\ai by

numerous references, that a great many well-authenticated instances of the intro-

duction of plants through commercial and general intercourse have greatly changed
the flora of difierent countries. These changes were often effected within a com-

paratively short period of time, and they were more or less complete in proportion
                                                                                                           7*

to the move or less favoiiraUeness of the climatic condition of the new stations of

--the introduced plants. After fully discussing these results, the author puts forward

his -s-iews in the following propositions :

   During two periods of prolonged and intimate intercourse between the northern
coast of Spain and the whole of Ireland, tlie conditions for bringing the seeds of
various plants into the latter country from the former probably existed; and during
the more recent of these periods, the existence of such trading and fishing inter-
course between Spain and the Asturian districts of Ireland is so well established,
and was of such a kind as to render the introduction of accidental seeds almost cer-
tain. Such seeds as required a warmer climate than that of Ireland for their ger-
mination necessarilj' foiled, while those which were suited to the physical conditions
into which they were thrown became naturalized. The winter isothermals, and

the corresponding distribution of minimum temperature, confined the range of these
plants to the two narrow Uttoral districts where thej' are found. The cold and wet
summers which often exist in Ireland woidd speedily destroy such annuals as hap-
pened to be introduced from the warmer summer climate of the North of Spain

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

but a few of the perennials might still continue to exist, owing to the favourable
conditions of winter temperature in the West of Ireland.

   The author briefly discussed the grounds which we possess for believing in a for-
mer intercourse between Spain and Ireland at a very remote epoch ; and he examines,

with great minuteness and detail, the evidence of such intercourse during a more
modern period. It appears that from the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries in-
clusive, the west and south-west of Ireland were in close communication with the
ports of Biscay and Asturias. Local histories and traditions, popular poetry, and
unpublished documents were referred to in support of this conclusion ; and it ap-
pears that many of the stations of the Asturian flora, where plants are actually
found, were also trading or fishing stations of Asturian or Biscaj'an mariners.

    In the two instances where names in the Irish language had been ascertained for
the Asturian plants, these names, in the opinion of Celtic scholars, clearly indicate
the introduction of the plants from foreign countries. It is also remarkable that
one of the plants of the Asturian flora has been observed in other parts of Europe
namelj^, Belgium and the islands ofl' the coast of Friesland, districts where the
Spaniards had considerable intercourse before the Netherlands had finally achieved
their independence. The winter climate of the Netherlands was probably not .suf-
ficiently favourable to the development of the other plants belonging to the Astu-
rian flora, and these are therefore confined to those parts of Ireland where all
the phj-sical and social causes favouring their growth have long existed in a suf-
ficiently high degi-ee of intensity.

 On the Wellingtonia gigantea, with remarls on its Form and Sate of Qroivth,
  as compared ivith the Cedrus Libani. By John Hogg, M.A., F.li.S., F.L.S.

    The author commenced his paper with a brief historical notice of the discovery
of this magnificent North-west American tree b}' Mr. Whitehead in June 18-jO, in
the Calaveras Grove in California.

   This grove is situated in a sloping valley on the moimtain-ridge between the South
 Antonio branch of the Calaveras, and the north fork of the Stanislaus Rivers, in
 lat. 38° N., and long. 120° 10' W., at an elevation of 4370 feet above the Pacific.
Having traced the subsequent and fuller accounts of the finding of more of these

immense evergreen conifers, by Messrs. Dowd and Lewis, Mr. Hogg enumerated

 some of the largest trees, and gave their dimensions, which are to be seen in the
 Calaveras Grove, to which he assigned the title of the " Original Grove." One of
 these, called the " Father of the Forest," measured 110 feet in circumference at the
 ground, and about 4.35 feet in height. It was shown that other trees of great size
 were also found in Crane Flat in Calaveras county, on one of the tributaries of the
 Big Creek, on an upper branch of the Frezno liiver, and in the Maripora Grove,
 between the Big Creek and the Marced. Also it appeared that in the year 1857

 INIr. Clark came upon two smaller groves of the same splendid tree. And more re-

 centlj' an eighth and larger grove was noticed about twelve miles east of the Frezno

 Grove,

   The author mentioned the names of some of the most remarkable of these " Mam-

moth Trees," with their dimensions, and stated that, instead of there being only tico
groves, as was at first supposed, there existed eight or nine in all; the° whole of

these localities are considered to possess from 1250 to 1300 trees.

   He then adverted to the generic differences of the JFi'lluir/tonia--a, name inap-

propiiately given by the late Dr. Liudley, instead of the more proper one " AVash-
mgtonia."

   Dr. Lindley, thinking that this conifer did not grow " above two inches in diameter
in twenty years," being equivalent to 24 lines in twenty years, concluded that its
age was 3000 years. In the year 1857 ]Mr. Hogg made another estimate of its age
after having examined some of the breadths of the annual zones in a section of a
part of the stem itself; and taking three lines, or a quarter of an inch in diameter
as its mean annual growth, especially as it is a tree of quick growth, this woidd
make the tree to be 1344 years of age. So Dr. Torrey subsequently came to a very
similar conclusion, from his own more accurate computation, that 'the tree had ex-

isted for 1200 years only, instead of 3000 years.

The author then remarked that that method of computation is not strictly to be

depended  upon                      and that it  is  a  question whether or not certain trees do undergo
                                 ;

two growths in even/ year, or only in certain favourable seasons. Several botanists

consider an annual double growth to be probable                                                                                                                                                                                  and especially, with regard to the

                              ;

and the second much broader and looser.

Dr. Hooker visited in September 1860 the ancient Cedar Grove in Moimt Leba-

non, at the elevation of about 6000 feet above the Mediterranean ; and he calcu-
lated from the concentric rings of a branch of an old tree, 8 inches in diameter

(xvithoid its bark), which had "no less than 140 rings," the younqest trees in that

valley of the Lebanon (Kedisha) would average 100, the oldest 2500 years in age.
Both of these estimates, however, Dr. Hooker considered to be " wide from tbe
mark."

   Mr. Hogg compared the annual increase in height of a healthy young Welling-

tonia, eight years old, with a Cedar of Lebanon, ten years of age, which was, accord-
ing to Loudon, planted in a very favourable situation near London.

   The Wellinf/tonia, growing in' the south extremity of the county of Durham, was
found to have increased in height in two years (when aged eight years) 3 feet 6^
inches, making it in Jidy 1868 to be 7 feet 6i inches in total height ; whilst the
young Cedar had only reached 7 feet in ten years.

   The same able Dendrologist says that the Cedar of Lebanon " does not begin to
produce cones till it is twenty-five or thirty years old," whereas this joimgirel-

linf/toniahoi-e two cones and one male tiower when six years of age, w'hich was in
Jime 1866 ; the last, or male flower, presented some scales with the anthers (small

balls of an orange colour) placed within them.

   The mode of growth with the young Cedar is by spreading out into horizontal

branches, whilst that of the young Wellinf/tonia is pj-ramidal and uprif/ht, with all
its lower portion beautifully branched. As the latter advances in age, it loses its
lower branches for about one-third or more of its total height. Thus, in that
colossal individual, the " Father of the Forest," it had lost its branches for about
200 feet from the ground ; its entire height being 435 feet.

   The author, in concluding, observed that the growth of largo trees, and the for-
mation of wood in the concentric zones or rings of the stems, required to be fur-
ther and more attentively investigated, as it is a very important question in vege-

table physiology.

and also one, representing a glorious primeval Cedar, taken last year in the Lebanon,

On the Necessity of Photographing Plants to obtain a better Jcnoivleclge of them.

                                   By Dr. Karl Koch.

   The author drew attention to the advantage of photographs to the systematist for
the comparison of plants. There are many plants of which the dry specimens in

the herbarium are not sufficient, especially in the case of trees, where the best de-
scriptions cannot give an idea of their physiognomy. The Liliaceous plants, and

nearly all the Monocotjdedous, in a divj state, give a bad view of their physiognomy.

In the Botanic Garden and glasshouses at Berlin, such plants are cultivated which

Afor their description or their diagnosis.  collection of plant-photographs is being

made at the Botanic Gardens at Berlin ; and the author would thank possessors of

gardens and greenhouses to send him photogi-aphs of interesting plants and trees.

The author exhibited the photograph of an Aroideous plant, from which he was

alone able to determine that the plant was new and to give a good diagnosis and

description.

On the Specific Identity of the Almond and the Peach. By Dr. Kael Koch.

   The author stated that he had travelled over the mountains of the Caucasus, Ai--
menia, some parts of Persia and Asia Minor, during four years, for the purpose of

studying the origin of our fruit-trees. Although the author could not assert that

ho had found them perfectly wild or run wild, he nevertheless had collected much
interesting material. The author believes that our pears and apples, cherries, most

plums, also peaches and apricots, are not natives of Europe. Only certain bad
varieties of plums have their origin from Prunus insititia, the ti-ee which grows
in a vnlA condition in the woods of Europe. After discussing the wild stock of our
cherries and pears, the author stated that apricots do not grow wild in Oriental

countries, but may perhaps come from China and Japan, as also the peaches. In

the east of Persia, however, a peach-shrub grows, which is intermediate between
the almond and the peach-trees. For some time natm-alists and gardeners have
asserted that there is no difference between almond and peach-trees; that the latter
is merely a variety in which the dry rind of the almond has become Heshy, and
where at the same time the stone has acquired a rough surface. Botanists say also

that the petioles of the almond-tree have ii.t the superior end small glands, which
are absent in the peach. But the nectarine, which is but a smooth-sJdnned peach,
exhibits these same glands. The flowers are not readily distinguishable of peach

and almond. On the shores of the Rhine a double-flowered variebi' grows, as to
which it is not certainly known whether it is peach or almond. In England and
France also there is a plant which is well known as the peach-almond, and which

is a constant variet3^ This plant occasionally produces a branch bearing good
peachen, but, as a rule, its fruit is intermediate in character. The property of ata-
^·ism seems to prove the derivation of the peach from the almond ; for occasionally
a sound peach-tree will produce a branch bearing almond-like fruit.

matiou of genera ; we liare thus obtaiuecl, not natural, but artificial gi-oups. For
the formation of natimil genera it is alwaj's uecessar}' to Imow also the vegetation

and the habit, both of which are very often in intimate connexion with the Howers
and fruits. The author has studied for a long time the crocuses and their -cegeta-
tion. The flowers of these plants do not always furnish good characters ; the pro-
portionate length of the stamens and the style, on which botanists lay great value,
is only relative, and is not always siu-e. Better characters for the great di-^-isions

are to be drawn from the vegetation. The author has observed that many crocuses
twist the leaves spirally when they are dry. The same crocuses have also a corm

in which the scales or the sheaths are cut across transversely at the base. In this
tribe of crocuses are foimd blue, pui-ple, white, and yellow flowers, as in the other
tribes, where the leaves are straight, and so tenacious that they can be used as
twine. The corms of the latter have the scales minutely or strongly reticu-

lated.

   The author gave another example where the vegetation is of the greatest value
for the systematist. Besides the leaves, the sheaths of the corms of the crocuses

are also verj^ important. He distinguished by this means four groups; first,

crocuses with corms in which the scales are circumscissile near the base ; secondly,
crocuses where the scales are furnished with long and straight nen'es; thirdly,
crocuses where the scales or sheaths are finely, or, foiu'thly, where they are

strongly reticulated.

   The bracts and the number of the flowers give also good marks for the distinc-
tion of the species ; we have crocuses with one and with two bracts, and ^vith one

or many flowers. When the author has finished his observations about the fruits

and seeds, he hopes to publish a treatise on the subject.

                                   Notes on the Flora of Sl-ye.

By M. A. L.iwsoif, Professor of Botany in the University of Oxford.

   During a short stay of a fortnight in the Isle of Skye in company with Pro-
fessor Oliver and Mr. II. S. Fox, the author drew up a list of all the plants that
came under their notice, and, since his return, compared it with others of the
neighbom-ing islands and mainland. Of this comparison the following is the

result.

   Besides these two lists 120 species from the Hebrides have never been recorded
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

while .51 species are recorded from the Hebrides -n-hich either do not grow in Skye,
or, what is much more probable, were overlooked by the author.

   Rihcs spicatum, Robson, with densely tomentose leaves, especially on the under
surface, was discovered first at Uig, and then in large quantities on the dills
about Dunvegan Head.

  Any botanist with a month to spare would be yet amply repaid in further

investigating the llora of this island; the more southern portion called the Sleat
was hardly examined, and as it is quite different in its geological formation to the
rest of Skye, a large number of species will in all probability be found, as yet un-
known to the subproviuce.

                 On the Discovery of Buxbaumia aplij'lla near London.

    By M. A. Lawson, Professor of Botany in the University of Oxford.

   One day towards the end of April last during an excursion to Virginia Water,

the author found on the freshly upturned clearings of a ditch, skirting a pine-wood,
six specimens of this curious and interesting little moss. Although recorded from

many parts of Scotland, it is but the third time it has been found in England.
The first to find it in Great Britain was the late Sir AVilliam Hooker, who, when

he was almost a boy, discovered it on some stumps of trees while shooting in
Sprowston "Woods in the neighbourhood of Norwich. Justly elated with this
piece of good fortune, he gave himself up (he had thought little of botany before)

to the study of plants. What, then, do we owe to this insignificant little" moss ?
   The third locality was Sawley Moor in Yorkshire, and both here and at Sprowston

it has been found only once.

    On Type Variation and Polymorjjhism in their relation to Mr. Bartvin's

           Theory of the Origin of Sjjeeies. By Bexjamin T. Lowne.

   The author considered the absence of any great departure from type directly
opposed to_ any considerable modification having taken place by selection, that the
simple absence of connecting links between different groups was in itself very diffi-
cult to explain, although pigrhaps the imperfection of geological record might fairly
be urged in explanation, yet that the diificulty is vastly increased when we re-
member that if such forms ever existed, they have left no diverging descendants.
If such a complex organ as the eye had been formed by natural selection, its
identity of type and structure throughout the Vertebrata'is inexplicable ; whilst
such forms as Taljm, Spalax, and ChrysocMoriis do not represent connecting links in
                                                                                                                             TRANSACTIONS OE THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                          105

the gi-adual development of the visual organ, since it must have been perfected long

before such creatures could have come into existence under the genetic theorv.

   Between the conflicting evidence afforded by such facts, which the author desig-
nated " rigidity of type," and the plasticity or variability of form shown to exist
by 'Mi: Darwin, in both the animal and 'vegetable kingdoms, he thought there
was but one safe theory, i. c. " that animals and plants varied, and are modified by

natural selection icithin certain limits."

   The author endeavoured to show that variability was a character inherent in

certain organisms capable, like other characters, of being increased or diminished by
selection in a number of successive generations. The slight amoimt of variation
known to exist in nature compared to that of domestic and cultivated forms, was
noticed at length, together ^\^th the amount and nature of variation in polymorphic
or protean genera. Mr. Lowne thought it highly probable that accidental

characters neither of use or the contrary to the individual, became fixed by isolation,

especially amongst insects, where a single male is often capable of impregnating a
whole isolated colony of females.

   The nature of the variation in Eucalyptus was stated to be quite unlike that of
most variable forms, the leaves and flowers, according to the author's obseiTations,
being -^-ery varialjle in each species in characters usually most constant in other
groups, so as to produce tlie greatest confusion in herbariums and scientific

descriptions, although he admitted that further evidence was wanted upon the

subject.

Divergence of character under competition was next discussed and stated to be

extremely exceptional                                                                                                        the gi-adual                                      extinction  of thirty species of Elephant                                                            and
                                                                                                                          ;

    On tlic Bor'inr/ of certain Annelids. Bi/ W. C. M'^Intosh, M.D., F.L.S.

   This paper was brought forward with a view to show that the chemical or acid
theory, advanced last year by Mr. Lankester, cannot be applied to the borino- of
Annelids, any more than it has been found to explain all the f;icts connected with
the perforations of Echinoderms, Gephyrea, Mollusca, Bryozoa, and Sponges, and
to maintain the statement of the author (which j\Ir. Lankester had doubted), viz.
that Lcucodorc cUiatus bores in aluminous shale.

   Instead of the boring of the latter species being new, as asserted by Mr. Lan-
kester, it, as well as the chemical theory in regard to annclidan boriDgs,'was shown
to be very old. Moreover the perforations occur in sandstone, as well as in alu-
minous shale, calcareous rock and shell. The author also described the borings of

supposed to have been introduced, and another locality in the county of Louth,
where the plant occupies a stono wall, the author pointed out the limited geo-
graphical range of the species, considered hitherto to be coniiued to a small area
of the moimtain-limestone district bordering on the counties of York, Lancashire,
and Westmoreland. Beyond this it had not been observed in the British Isles till
its discovery last year near Llangollen by J\Ir. George R. Jebb, of Ffrith Hall,

Wrexham. It occurs abundantly in a recess of the escai'pment three and a half
miles north of Llangollen, immediately to the soutb of Craig Arthur, which forms

the western extremity of this part of the mountain-limestone range.
   Its limited distribution as regards altitude was noticed here as in the Yorkshire

habitats. In both districts it appears to be confined to a range of altitude between
1000 to 1100 feet above the sea-level, and also occupies the same position on the
mountain limestone, occurring within 200 or 250 feet of its base both in Yorkshire
and Denbighshire. The fern is also said to have been found on the Eglwyseg
rocks, a little to the east of Llangollen, about four miles from the Craig Arthur

habitat.

On tTii " Muffa " of the Sulphur Springs of Valdieri in Piedmont.

                      ' By M. MoGGRiDGE, F.G.S.

    MuiFa is found in those springs which have a temperature of about 50° Centi-
gi'ade. It first appears as tender minute filaments, soft and floating, of a greenish-
white colour. It soon becomes more substantial, changing to violet, then light-
yellow, and finally to pale-green.

    It was considered by Allioni to be ZTlva lahyiinthiformis, Linn. In 1837 Fontan
describes it as composed of filaments j J-q to ^iro of ^ millimetre in diameter,
tubidar, cylindi'ical, simple, devoid of septa, containing semiopake globules, coUo-

cated when yoimg, separated towards the ends when mature. He named it <Sm/-

Discoverri o/Scirpus parvuliis in Ireland. By A. G. More, F.L.S.

The author found Sciipus parvulus a few weeks ago growing abundantly in some

salt-marsli creeks bordering on the north side of the river Ovoca, where it falls into

the sea at Arklow. The station of the plant is peculiar, as it grows quite by itself

on the surface of the soft mud which is overflowed at high water, and where no

other sea-side plants seem able to secure a footing. The creeks are bordered by a

luxuriant vegetation of Jimcus maritinms, J. Gerardi, Poa maritima, &c., but the

author did not find Scirpus parvulus  mixed with  them                             it  occurs only towards the
                                                                                ;

deeper water upon the soft mud, which we usually find quite bare of vegetation

and it was from observing the little green tufts in such an unusual situation that

he was led to examme them more closely, when the spikes of a Scirpus left no
doubt as to what it was.

Scirpus xxtrndus is truly subaqueous for a large portion of its existence, and shows

some resemblance to Isoetes in the structure of its stems, which grow with their

lower third buried in the mud, and are cellular and transparent, being composed of

four (or rarely five) longitudinal tubes divided at intervals by numerous trans-

verse partitions. Finding among authors considerable difterences of opinion as to

the presence or absence of sheaths, the existence of leaves, and the duration of the
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                 107

root, the author has taken some pains in examining many specimens, and thinks
he may say that nearly all the stems are sheathed at the base by a very thin close-

pressed transparent membrane, wliich is always to be seen surrounding the rising

stems, and which the author is disposed to think may have fallen or decayed away

in the lew cases where he did not see it on the adult stem. Fm'ther, he inferred

that these sheaths should be considered to represent the leaves, and that the so-
called leaves are only barren stems ; and certainly these outer stems do not sheathe

the innei', as occurs, for instance, in the fronds of Isoctes, but each rises indepen-

dently from the side of its neighbour. The little tufts throw out numerous white
fibrous roots, and also very slender filiform runners ending in minute tubers, which
he believes are hybernacula, and serve to propagate the plant*. Hence, even if the
tufts die away annually, the tubers will still remain and the root be perennial.

    This little plant seems widely scattered along the coasts of Europe, from the

Baltic and German Ocean in the north to the Adriatic in the south, occurring
especially in many localities on the western coast of France, but is everywhere a
rare and local species, and is said to be more abundant in some seasons than at
others. In England it has not been gathered since 1837, when the Rev. G. E.
Smith collected specimens near Lymington in Hants, so that its discovery at Arklow
may almost claim to restore to the British flora a very curious and interesting species.

Fresh specimens of Svirpiis jxirvtdus were exhibited to the Section.

On tJie Difficulties of Darwinism. By the Rev. F. 0. Morris.

   Mr. Darwin's fh'st work on ' Selection by Species ' is alone referred to in this
paper. The old belief was that a species, subject indeed to variety, was a separate
kind of itself, and had so continued from the original creation. The new theory,

viz. that so-called species are not descendants of originals of the same kind, but
the offspring and offshoots in the lapse of vast ages of a more linnted number of
forms by process of natural selection, leads to the startling result that all species,

genera, orders, classes had one common source of being in some one first parent.
One cause imagined to operate in this subdivision of species is an internal impulse

acting on accidental advantages and conrpelling a continued change in the form.
It is quite true that energies of the mind called forth by exigencies of the body do

--produce changes and improvements in the body for a time, but not permanently,

not beyond the indi^'idual concerned as in the case of the blind, vv'hose other senses
are quickened to make up for the loss of sight. Examples were given of the adap-

tation to circumstances in their case, and the capacity to improve the condition of
the individual corporeally. But these powers only serve the occasion. They are
not permanent or hereditary.

Again, if by the retention of accidental advantages, such as superior streno-th,

new species are formed, how can this apply to insects and birds only distinouish-

able by colour, and with few gradations in relative strength ? If the sti-ongest

creatures were intended to prevail, why have the Dinotherium and Plesiosam-us

and Mammoth perished ? If insects with elaborate organs live but a few days or
weeks, how could those organs have been produced by process of natural selec-

tion ? If there was only one species'at first, whence and why that diversity of plants

suitable for the food of various species ? Why, if natural selection acts for the good

of the creature, are so many transmutations of a downward tendency ? Is not every

variety of pigeon a pigeon still, and so of the horse, ox, dog ? May not each species

be at once seen in the variety ? Was the primordial form both male and female ?
How came it to reqiure improvement in its normal condition ? Was it of animal
Whyor vegetable nature ?
                          do lower forms exist still ? Can a strong or handsome

man secure the transmission of his strength or beauty, wish as he may ? Yet man

is the highest creature, and he, if any, might desire to benefit his offspring by per-

petuating natural advantages. And why should not this supposed power of natural

selection avail a man to get rid of disadvantages, as in the case of a blind person
Whyor otherwise deficient ?
                             the retrogressions and degradations seen amono-st

mankind ? Some such disadvantages are temporarily hereditary, and no volitfon

can remove them. If the power of selection can perpetuate change of form, why

cannot it alter the ordinary condition ? Dfedalus could not throw out wings with

spheric and other causes that sweep ofl' the rest, leaving- those horn earlier or later

Howto survive ?  do hoth parents ohtain the same improved condition at once ?

Do the creatures trouhle themselves about their ofispring ?

With regard to the reversion of varieties to their original forms, which Mr.

Darwin doubts, is not the pansy an example of the difficulty of keeping varieties
distinct ? and so with other flowers which have a tendency to revert to their inferior

originals.

 --After touching on various other difficulties, the questions were put, Whence do

birds derive the migi-atory impulse ?
   Again, the great object of numberless creatures is the mere perpetuating of their

kind^ which is no sooner attained in the last and briefest stage of existence of the

majority of insects than they die, leaving their progeny to the same course of long
existence in the egg, caterpillar, and chrysalis state, and then for a similar destruc-
tion to follow immediately on the deposit of their eggs. There is no time for the
supposed exercise of natural selection. They are born, lay their eggs, and die,
having been dormant in the egg and chrysalis states. They can only energize in

the imperfect caterpillar stage. And what thought can the caterpillar take for

improving its condition in the imago state ? Only the perfect insect could desire
a change, but the perfect insect has no wants to supply, and therefore can wish for

no change.

  Why do no characteristics of the earliest forms sometimes show themselves in

animals of the present day ?

The author believes that the multiplication of races is liuiited, not b}' their

warring against each other, but by laws of nature inscrutable to us.

   On the Zoological Aspect of Game Laivs.
B)j Professor Alfred Newton, M.A., F.L.S.

The term " CTame Laws " seems to express most conveniently all those regula-

tions which have been adopted in various coimtries to control the relation of man

to wild animals, and in this sense the phrase is here used.

The subject of the destruction of animals is rarely discussed in the public prints

without great exaggeration, and the most one-sided views of the question are con-

stantly presented. Some advantage, however, has arisen from the attention of

the public having been called to the question. The most efl'ectual protection to

Aanimals is that attbrded by public opinion.  most striking instance of its influence

is that presented bj' the fox. Not much more than a century ago, the British

farmer was only induced to permit the galloping of horses and hounds over liis

corn by the reflection that they were doing him a gxeat service in ridding him of

a pestilent marauder, and he would hear with grim satisfaction that the scourge

of his wife's hen-roost had been run into, or he would ^^·illiugly at a vestry-meeting

pass the chm-chwardens' accounts giving rewards for the destruction of a vixen

and her cubs among other so-called vermin. Now-a-days the British farmer is

generally in the first flight of the horsemen, and the fox has no friend so stauncli.

A similar change in public opinion witli regard to other wild animals is most

desirable. The public should feel that they have an interest in the protection of

wild animals, especially during the season of reproduction. The decrease of these

animals, however, is often attributed to secondaiy causes, and not to direct

slaughter. Man had no great spite against the Bustard or the Great Copper

--Butterfly, but both have been extirpated mthin living memory the latter pro-

bably owing to the drainage of tlie fens, thougli tlie precise mode in which its

extinction has been accomplished is not exactly known. Both, however, might

possibly have been preserved by a little judicious care. At any rate, if the progress

of civilization unconsciously demands some few victims, we sliould abstain from

wilfully adding to their number. Mr. Tristram contended, at the last Meeting of

the Association, that birds of prey were the .sanitary police of nature, and that if

they had existed in their original stiength they would have " stamped out " the

gi-ouse disease, just as the Orders in Council "stamped out" the cattle-plague.
                 TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTION'S,                109

Hawks, by preference, make sickly birds their quarry. lu Norfolk there is no

moor game, and therefore no grouse disease. But the game-preservers of the

county believe that their stock of pheasants and partridges is materially increased

by the destruction of everything which they are pleased to call vermin. Now

the abundance of game has but little to do with the scarcity of birds of prey, and

iu some foreign countries the existence of numerous birds of prey is a pledge of the
Jlentifulness of game. Owls are undoubtedly the game-preserver's best friends.

lis most serious foe is the rat, and owls consume more rats and mice than any

other description of food, an assertion proved by the investigations of Dr. Altum

(Journ. fiir Orn. 1863, pp. 41-46, 1864, pp. 429-434 ; Ber. xiv. Versamml. D. 0. G.

pp. 30-34, and Zool. Gart. 1867, pp. 262-266) and others. So with regard to
polecats, stoats, and weasels. With reference to sea-fowl, a certain amount of

sentiment may be confessed. No animals are so cruelly persecuted. At the

breeding-season they come to our shores, throwing aside their wary and suspicious

habits, and sometimes settling far inland. No one has ever complained of them as

injurious, as raising the price of herrings, sprats, or oysters. Yet excursion trains
convey the " sportsmen " of Loudon and Lancashire to the Isle of Wight and

Flamborough Head, for the purpose of destroying these harmless birds. Each bird

shot was a parent, and its young were thus exposed to death from hunger. Could

men blaze away hour after liour at those wretched birds without being morally the
Weworse for it?
                 thank God that we are not as Spaniards, gloating over the

brutality of bull-fights, whilst we forget the agony inflicted on thousands of innocent

birds on our coasts to which that of a dozen horses and bulls in a ring is as nothing.

The enormous demand for the feathers of sea-fowl bj^ the modern fashion of ladies'

hat plumes has added to this cruel destruction.

Tlie legislative appointment of a " close time," to be proclaimed by the local

authorities, during which the mere carrying of a gun should be an ofl'ence, is abso-

lutely necessar)'. This plan has been adopted in several countries, including some

of the most democratic, as shown by the Game Laws of Switzerland, Norway, the

United States of America, and several British colonies. The question is one wholly

unconnected with party politics, and it should be so regarded. If the present state

of things continues much longer, far greater changes will take place with regard to

the fauna of this country than most persons suspect, and they will be changes for

which the zoologists of future generations will not thank us.

the top with a triangular opening, from which springs a gold-coloured bayonet-

          On the Structural Peculiarities of certain Sajpindaceous Plants,
                                By Professor Radlkofer.

   The ordinary mode of growth of the stem of dicotyledonous plants is by the
continual addition of a cylindrical layer of tissue between the bark and wood, a
110 REPORT--1868.

new stratiim of wood being fonned by tlie cambium outside the old wood, and a
new stratum of bark on the inside of the full-grown bark. From this ordinary

mode there are occasional deviations. In a former paper I directed the attention

of botanists to one exception in the case of Menispermacea;, where at the end of
every three or four years the cambium becomes inactive, and a new one is formed

outside of the bast.

   Having been for some time engaged in the systematic study of the difficult tribe
of Sapindacese (the " crux Botanicorum "), I have had abundant opportunities of

examining the structural peculiarities of this most interesting tribe of plants, the

small branches of herbarium specimens exhibiting the same peculiarities which
strike observers with so much surprise in large trunks.

I do not propose at present to explain in detail the development of these irregu-

larities in iSapindaceje, nor to trace their relations to other families, such as

MyBiguoniacese, Malpighiaceas, &c.  object is to state as briefly as possible the

most remarkable modihcations of wood structure which I have observed. To enter

into details, it would be necessary to have the specimens themselves at hand,

but it would not have been possible to bring with me the numerous materials

which I ha\e had from the Berlin, "S^ienna, Copenhagen, St. Petersburgh, and other

Herbaria.

The two genera in which I have observed anomalous stem-structure are Serjania

and Paullinia, and in both normal stems also occur. In Fmdlima I have noticed

only one type of irregularity with some slight modifications, and as the same type

with nearly the same modifications is found in Serjania, I shall confine my remarks

to the latter genus.

   If we examine transverse sections of young branches (one to thi-ee years old) of
Serjania, we seldom find a circular wood. In most species it is angular, trigonal

or pentagonal. In some species the angles are verj' prominent, so that the wood

is deeply furrowed, or, what is j^et more striking, the angles become detached from

the centre, so that the wood is compound.

   Difierent kinds of compound wood occur in difierent species. There may be as
many peripheral detached parts as there are angles, or there may be fewer, some-
times only one ; or again, there may be more, often as many as eight or ten nearly

touching one another, so as to form a ring round the central wood. The peripheral
parts may be either cylindrical with the stem indented, or the parts may be flattened

in difierent degrees, and in the latter case the stem is smooth, without any indica-

tion of the internal irregularity.

Besides all these modes of irregularity, there is yet another which cannot be

brought into connexion with them, and which I have not seen anywhere described.

It consists in the wood being split by radial divisions into five nearly equal portions.

This I call divided wood.

  We can thus distinguish in difierent .species of Serjania, round wood, ^)oA/-

f/oual wood, furroived Avood, compound wood, with as many or more parts

Nowthan there are angles, and finally divided wood.  I have found that in each

species of Serjania and Paullinia the form of stem is constant, provided the obser-

vation be made in the right place, namely about the middle of the branch, and not

at the lower part near its origin, where the difierent parts of the compoiind and
divided wood are commonly united into one single wood. The section must also

not be made immediately below a leaf ; for there the number of peripheral parts is

frequently diminished by their union with the central wood. The neglect of these

precautions has led to the belief by former observers that there is no constancy in

each species. There is, however, certainly such constancy, and as it is now for the

first time pointed out, I desire particularly to dkect attention to it, as well as to the

further fact, that the structure of the wood corresponds closely vnth the specific

characters derived from the flower and fruit, so that gTOups of species formed from

the wood-structure will be nearly identical with those based on flower and fruit-

structure, and yaaj therefore be considered as quite natural.

   It would lead me too far were I to attempt to lay before you an abstract of these
natural groups thtis formed. They will appear in a general work which I am

publishing on Sapiudacere, where they will be accompanied by the necessary plates.

I may mention here, that the grouping of the species of Paidlinia and Serjania

by the form of the leaves, the only method hitherto tried, is in no way natural, and
is therefore of no value. By the careful study of the stem-structure I hope that it

will iu future not be more difficult to determine the species of these two now so very

confused genera, than those of Saxifraga or any other very large genus. It is to be

regretted that the earlier botanists have never in their descriptions or figm-es given

any particulars of the structure of the stem. Had they done so, many mistakes

would have been avoided. For example, it would never have been possible to
confound the Serjania triternata of Willdenow with the PaulUnia curassavica of

Jacquin, or the Serjania lupuUna of Schumacher, as has so often been done. The
only instance in which I have met with a recognizable figure of stem-structure iu

the copious literature of Sapindaceae is in Pavon's figure of his Semarillana alata,

the PauUinia alata of Don.

There is yet another structural peculiarity which will probably aiford a good

character for distinguishing the species of Serjania, which I find nowhere noticed.

It is the epidermis of the leaves, which in some species is formed of what is called

My" Collenchyma," like the epidermis of the seeds of Limim.  observations on

this point being still in progi-ess, I content myself here with the mere notice of the

fact.

           On the Extinction of tlie Great Bustard in Norfolh and Suffolk.

                               By H. Stevenson, P.L.S.

   After referring to some veiy early allusions to the existence of the bustard in
this country, and to the gradual diminution and extinction of the species in the
different English counties, the author said that Norfolk was the last county to
reckon the bustard amongst its resident species. The two latest " droves " had
their headquarters in the open country round Swafiham and in that near Thetford.
The Swafl"hani drove formerly consisted of twenty-seven birds, but the number
subsequently decreased to seventeen, sixteen, and eleven, and finally dwindled
dowTi to five and two. All accounts agreed in stating that the last remaining birds
were hens. One great cause of the extinction of the bird was the introduction of
improved agricultural implements, which destroyed the eggs. The precise time of
extinction could not be determined with accuracy. The last known specimens
were seen about the year 1838 ; but it had been stated that some of the birds had
lingered on till 184.3 or 1845. The other drove, near Thetford, consisted of thirty
or forty birds; but the number gradually declined to twenty-fom-, eighteen, fifteen,

nine, seven, six, five, and two, the last" survivors being hens only. Some persons
suppose that the bird could be taken by dogs, but this was not confirmed by the
testimony of trustworthy eye-witnesses. The autlior referred to the local distribu-

tion of the bustard in the coimty, and to the appearance of occasional immigrants
from the Continent.

                              By Feancis E. Anstie, M.D.

   The aiithor described certain effects of alcohol upon the pulse which he had ob-
served with the aid of Marey's sphygmograph. Tliis instrmnent, which -wi-ites the
form of the pulse-waves upon paper or smoked glass, has recently been rendered

presses upon the pulsatiug artery may be calculated iu grammes. The subject of

the author's researches was the febrile pulse of typhus and other fevers, and of

pneumonia and some other acute intfanimations. In all these diseases the arterial

tension is lowered throughout the period of fevers and elevated temperature. The

pulse-curve always becomesdicrotous: insteadofthe wave being slightlv</;;-ee-pointed,

it presents only /ico elevations with a gap or notch between them, which is more or

less deep in direct ratio with the violence of the febrile symptoms and the lowering

Whenof arterial tension.  alcohol acts fa-^'ourably (as indicated by the decline of

temperature, shwirifi of the pulse, and cessation of delirium or stupor), it is univer-

sally found that the pulse-curve becomes less dicrotous [elevated tension] ; on the

contrary, when alcohol confuses the intellect and aggravates the feverishness, the

pulse-trace is invariably rendered more markedly dicrotous, the notch being
deepened [lowered tension]. It is therefore of first-rate importance, when we are

in doubt as to the propriety of administering alcohol in fe\ers or inflammation, to

give an experimental dose, taking comparative sphygmographic traces before, and

15 minutes after tlie administration. If arterial tension has been increased, the

alcohol maj' bs confldently continued if it has been diminished, the alcohol must
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

be at once diminished or altogether discontinued, for the experimental dose has

acted as a depressant.

   The above rules are chiefly applicable to the cases in which the pulse is of a
certain volume, and its sphygmographic curves are large. But there are many

cases in which the pulse is small, although it presents all the true dicrotism of the

febrile pulse. It is then of great consequence to ascertain whether the smallness

of the pulse is due to impairment of the heart-power ; and the new arrangement

discover, namely, the exact amount of spring-pressure under which the pulse-

curves are produced of tlie maximum size. If the pressure required to develope the
maximum curve be as much as 200 or 250 grammes, this indicates a good amount
of heart-power ; if, on the contrary, the maximum curve be obtained with a
pressure of only 100 to 120 grammes, we may be sure the heart is decidedly feeble

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

and it is preeminently a case for the administration of alcohol.

   Such are the empirical facts which the author has established by an experience
of many hundred cases of fever and inflammation. The physiological explanation

of them is by no means so certain. Is the elevation of arterial tension which is

certainly produced by a dose of alcohol which (under the circumstances) acts as a

reviving stimulant, while it simultaneouslj' reduces tlie feverishness, brought about
by a stimulation of tlie ^·a,so-motor nerves, causing contraction of the arterioles ?
Or is it produced by a stinmlatiou of the vagus, whose centi'al power over the

heart it increases ? Or does it act b}^ a general stimulation of the spinal cardiac

centres, wliich also might antagonize the excessive action of the heart ? The

author is of opinion that stimulation of the sj/mpathetic is at anj' rate the earliest,

and probably throughout the chief, p.art of the effect of alcohol on the circulation.

On the other hand, Professor Behier of Paris (who has also observed with the

sphygmograph the remarkable effects of alcohol upon the pulse in acute disease),

while admitting the extreme complexity of the problem, is more inclined to believe

that stimulation of the central power of the vagus has the principal share in the

tonic and slowing eflects of alcohol upon the circulation.

illa5tratioii3 were accepted as liiglily satisfixctory ; but the tlieory itself, beino-

so:ne\vliat novel iu relation to physiology , has remained altogether unappreciated
by the prot'ossion. The object of the present paper, therefore, was to bring forward

a case of similar action occurring in situ, in connexion with the teeth, which should

afford a more decisive illustration of the fact of electrolysis having taken place in
the mouth under corresponding circumstances, and the elements ot^the tooth sub-

stance having become so disposed of The proof tendered was as follows : On
removing a ligature of silk twist which had been placed upon some upper front

teeth, a deep groove was found to have been formed in the enamel along its entire

course                            at the same time the fibres of the silk                                                                                                       had  become  matted     together with
                               ;

an incrustation of crystals of lime, showing an unmistakeable case of "electrolytic

transfer, in which the lime-salts of enamel had been dissolved and recrystallized

upon the silk.

In the theory of dental decay by electrolysis, particles of charcoal arising from

eremacausis or slow combustion, which like the silk are electro-negative, are re-

presented as playing the same part with the enamel and dentine as" the silk had
done in tlie present instance
                                                                                                                                                          ;  but  it was  also  stated  that pressure,  renderino-  the

part non-homogeneous, was equally capable of producing a negative centre^froni

which local galvanic action would arise. The characters peculiar to decayed

--dentine are its entire decalcification and absence of lime solution, but havino- in

its stead an abundance of free acid two features which aU other theories°are

incapable of accoimtino' for. If a piece of ivory be placed for a few days in water

under the electrodes of a small sustaining battery, the spot beneath and around the

anode, or positive electrode, will be found to have become decalcified, softened, and

strongly acid, j ust as these conditions occur in natural decay. In addition to this, the

lime \\-ill be transferred to the cathode inthe same manner as it was to the silk, a fact
which affords the only intellioible explanation of the formation of tartar yet offered.
Tartar may be thro-s\m down from the saliva as an electro-deposit ; it is repelled by

the electro-positi\-e crown of the tooth, but adheres to the electro-negative root at

its neck. This polar condition of the tooth, illustrated in the different modes of
growth between the crown and the root, is refen-ed to as a very important character

and one to be well considered ; for all remedial and reparatory measures, to be'

successful, must be in harmony with such an arrangement.

    Professor Cleland pointed out that in ordinary circumstances the tube is

ment he mentioned that he had had the opportunity of seeing the orifice of this
tube in a patient with a limited ulcer of the palate, and that he had made this
patient swallow with his mouth open, and had the satisfaction of demonstrating to

several pupils that the Eustachian orifice was then momentarily closed. He pro-

ceeded to take up the anatomical part of the subject, and showed that the disposi-
tion of the palatal muscles was in harmony with this observation, and such as to
render Mr. loynbee's theory untenable.

On tlie Belative Weir/ht and Form of the Eye and Colour of the Iris in Vertebrate
                        '^Animals. By Edwards Crisp, M.I).

   This paper on the relative weight, form, and coloiu- of the eye in the vertehrata
was illustrated by drawings and casts of the eye of more than 1000 animals. The
eyes of 600 anim'als, quadrupeds, birds, reptiles, and fishes, fiUed with plaster of

Paris, and coloured by the author after nature, were also exhibited with wax casts of

the eye and muscles of the Lion, Elephant, Giraffe, Walrus, and Whale. According
to the author, brown was the prevailing colour of the eye in aU mammals, birds,
and reptiles ; whilst in fishes yellow, yeUow-brovra and whitish-yellow were the
most frequent hues. Fishes have proportionately the largest eyes among the yer-
tehrata, and among the laud-quadrupeds the Giraffe, Horse, Eland, Elk, and Bison
have the visual organ of the greatest size. The preparations of the eye were in-
tended to show the great advantage of the use of plaster of Paris in certain anato-
mical preparations, a method first made known by the author at the Meeting of the
Association at Bath in 1864, and at the Zoological Society of London in 1853.

On some Points relating to the Visceral Anatomy of the Thylacinus.

                         By Edwards Crisp, M.D.

The author in this paper on the intestinal canal of the Thylacinus (Tasmanian
Awolf), said he was the first to notice it in 1854.
                                                     male and female sent over in

spirits had been recently dissected, and in the stomach of the male a marsupial,
weighin^about two poimds, was found, with the skin nearly entire and many of the

bones. The animal has the most remarkable alimentaiy canal, according to the

author, of any animal in existence. It barely exceeds twice the length of the body,

--and is covered with villi so as to extend the absorbing surface a beautiful and

wise provision in an animal that travels long distances for its food. The duodenum

c^ose to the pylorus is thickly studded with slender villi ; these become larger, and

are more closely packed in the central part of the tube, and extend to about 18

inches from the" anal opening. They resemble somewhat the villi in the small

intestines of the Rhinoceros and those in the third stomach of the Hippopotamus,

as was shown in various drawings to the Section.

              On the Intestinal Canal and other Viscera of the Gorilla.
                                By Edwards Crisp, M.D.

   The author in this paper compared the visceral anatomy of the Goiilla, Chim-
panzee, and Orang with that of Man. The paper was illustrated by numerous

drawings, and a model of the viscera of the Gorilla. Two of these apes (Gorillas),

a yoimg one and an adult, the author had examined, the last named by permission

--of the Council of the Royal College of Surgeons. The subjoined were some of his

conclusions : That the thoracic and abdominal viscera of the Gorilla generally

difier considerably more from those of Man than the same parts in the Chim-

panzee and Orang ; and looking to majiy other brutal characters in this animal the

line of demarcation between it and Man is so wide and definite that we may dis-
claim all relationship with him and his four-handed colleagues. Among the dif-

ferences pointed out in the visceral anatomy of the Gorilla, were the enormous

capacity of the csecum and large intestines, the peculiar glandular stiucture of the
former," and especially the tripartite division of the liver.. Comparisons were made
between the length of the intestinal canal of this ape and that of !Man, the Orang,

Chimpanzee, and many of the lower quadrumana. The intestinal tube of the adult

Gorilla measured 34 feet 7 inches in length, that of the young animals (aged about

12 months) 13 feet 9| inches.

Viewing the faculty of speech as an instrument of thought and language, as the
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  115

ininister and interpreter of the thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the mind, the
author maintained that, in all cases of loss of speech which are of cerebral origin,
there is involved either structural change or functional derangement in the nervous
apparatus of the intellectual consciousness. The author briefly narrated two illus-
trative cases out of a number which had come under his observation, one of struc-
tm-al change, and the other of functional derangement, both of striking significance.

But the point which he wshed especially to impress upon every physiological

psychologist was this, viz. that the power of giving utterance to our thoughts and
ideas in appropriate language depends upon the due relation being maintained in

its integiity between the centres of intellectual action and the encephalic motor

--centres through whicli the volitional power is exercised in articulate speech in

other words, between the cerebral hemispheres and the corpora striata. For
thoughts and ideas might be moulded for expression in the seat of intellectual
action, but the agency of the will or volitional power to give them utterance re-
quires the integrity of the motor centres, through which the volitional impulses
operate on speech. The author said a special cerebral organ had been assigned to
the faculty of speech, and that the illustrious Gall was the first to locate it in the

anterior lobes ot the brain. Since his time the subject had undergone much dis-
cussion in France, and conflicting evidence had been adduced. He adverted to the
hypothesis of Dr. Dax, that the left hemisphere of the brain was iU exclimve seat,
but to which he could not subscribe. The brain is a double organ ; the functions

of both hemispheres are identical, in harmonious accordance with the doubleness

of the organs of sense, as double inlets to knowledge. Professor Broca, who

claimed the honour of being the fu'st to discover that the third convolution was the
seat of the faculty of articulate speech, was constrained to admit that the function
was not exclusively exercised on the left side of the brain, although disease there,
with hemiplegia of the right side, was almost universally characterized by aphasia.
The author, in proof that the right hemisphere exercised the same function in regard
to articulate speech as the left, adduced a case in which there was extensive disease
in the left hemisphere, on the very site of Broca's organ, and yet dm'ing life the
faculty of speech was not impaired.

            On the Homologies and Notation of the Teeth of Mammalia,
                          By W. H. Flower, F.R.S., F.L.8.

   After some introductory observations, the author stated that the subject which

he proposed to bring before the Meeting was an endeavour to ascertain how much

of the generally adopted system of classification and notation of the teeth of the

--Mammalia a system mainly o\Aang to the researches of Professor Owen, whose

labours in this department of anatomy no follower in the same field could fail to

--recognize gratefully stands the test of renewed investigations, how much seems

doubtful and requires further examination before it can be received into the

common stock of scientific knowledge, and how much (if any) is at actual variance

with well-ascertained facts.

   One of the most important of the generalizations alluded to is the division of
the class Mammalia, in regard to the times of formation and the succession of

--their teeth into two groups the Monophyodonts, or those that generate a single

set of teeth, and the Dijihyodonts, or those that generate two sets of teeth.
The Monophyodonts include the orders Monotremata, Edentata, and Cetacea ; all
the rest of the class being Diphyodonts. The teeth of the former group are more
simple and imiform in character, not distinctly divisible into sets to which the
terms incisor, canine, premolar, and molar have been applied, and follow no known
numerical law. The group is, in fact, equivalent to that to which the term Ho-

inodont has been applied by some authors. On the other hand, in the mammaliaH

orders with two sets of teeth, tliese organs are said to acquii'e fixed individual
characters, to receive special denominations, and can be determined from species

to species, tlie animals so characterized being Heterodonts.

   The author then .showed that among the homodonts, the nine-banded iVrmadillo
vi\a3 certainly a diphyodont, having two complete sets of teeth, and among the
heterodonts, many were partially, and probably some completely, monophyodont.

                                                                                                        8*
IIG REPORT--1868.

Moreover that almost every intermediate condition between complete dipliyodont
and simple niouophyodont dentition existed, citing especially the Sirenia, Elephants,

Rodents, and Marsupials. He then, by the aid of diagrams, showed particularly

--two modes of transition between monophyodont and diphyodont dentition one in

which the number of teeth changed was reduced to a single one on each side of
each jaw, as in Marsupials, and the other in which the first set of teeth, retaining
their fidl number, were reduced to mere functionless rudiments, .and even disap-
pearing before birth, as in the case of the seals, especially the great Elephant seal.
These observations showed that the terms "monophyodont" and "diphyodont,"
though useful additions to our language, as means of indicating briefly certain
physiological conditions, have not, as applied to the mammalian class, precisely the
same significance that their author originally attributed to them.

   The classification and special homologies of the teeth of the heterodont mammals
was next discussed. Certain generalizations as to the prevailing number of each

kind of teeth in different groups of animals were sustained, but deviations were

shown from some of the rules laid down, such as that when the premolars fall short
of the typical number, the absent ones are from the fore part of the series. The
 general inference was, that, although in the main the sj'stem of notation of the
mammalian teeth, proposed by Professor Owen, was a gi-eat advance upon any one
previously advocated, we must hesitate before adopting it as final and complete in
 all its details, and need not relax in our endeavour to discover some more certain

 methods of determination.

On the Anatomy of the Carinaria Mediterranea. By Eobekt Gaknee, F.L.S.

In this paper the author gave the anatomy of a male and female specimen, with-

out any reference to the descriptions of previous observers, as Delle Chiaje, Verany,

and others. The cylindrical form of the animal, finned tail, curiously modified

molluscan foot, and the viscera excluded, as it were, by hernia, from the body, and

covered by the delicate shell, are tolerably well known. The envelope or tegument,

though tuberculated or spiny, as well as covered with small and larger granulated

opacities, and mottled with brown, is so diaphanous that the stomach and first

Apart of the intestine can be seen through it.  second inner coat is composed of

a beautiful network of muscular fibres, but the tail has fascicles only from this coat.

The foot or abdominal fin, earned, however, upwards as the animal swims, is neatly

reticulate and tinged with rose-colour, and has a little suctorial disk on its posterior

edge. The sea- water is admitted into the body of the animal by a pore behind this

fin. The animal has a retractile trunk, and tentacles with well-developed eyes.

Within the muscular sac, besides the stomach and first part of the intestine, is little

else but the buccal apparatus, two salivary glands opening near the commencement

of the gullet, the brain and pedal ganglion, and aorta. The ribbon of lingual teeth

--is pretty simple a tricuspate broad tooth in the centre, a large hook on each side

laterally, and between the two another piece with a long and short point. These
teeth dissolve in boiling nitric acid, and consequently are not siliceous. The buccal

box itself is ample, with six or seven pairs of extraneous muscles, besides powerful

intrinsic ones attached to its cartilaginous basis. The stomach, which immediately

succeeds, contained remains of Pteropoda (small conical Cleodora;), of small Cepha-

lopoda, and portions of the lingual ribbons of its owii species ; also beautiful discous

and other Diatoms. The bulk of the viscera are covered by the shell, which also

has attached to it the muscles, with much the same disposition as is seen in a Pa-
tella. The intestine entering this nucleus makes many con-\-olutions at the front

of the shell, and then opens on the right side under the margin of the shell and

mantle. Tbe brain is supra-03Sophageal, and is seen to consist of three amalgamated

pairs of ganglia. Of course it gives nerves to the ej'es and feelers close at hand,

the former having large lenses covered by the transparent skin ; also to the mouth,
and is connected with two little ganglia situated on the buccal box. Four nerves

go backwards from the lateral and posterior parts of the brain, two forming a lobed

ganglion near the abdominal fin, supplying it and the tail, and two rising towards

nervous enlargements near the pylorus, and auditory sacs on the pedal ganglion.

The branchiae, about twelve-divided, lie across the fore part of the mouth of the

shell, attached on the left side, where are the heart and branchial veins ; on the right

is the branchial artery, receiviuo- a larg-e branch from tlie renal organ situated above.

Higher still in the shell is the liver with its bile-ducts, and above the liver, in the

recess of the shell, the testis in the male and the ovary in the female. The duct

from each goes downwards ; in the male it opens into a sinus of the integument of

the right side, where is also seen, at its termination, a little twisted exsertile body,

but which sinus does not exist in the female, the opening being higher, close to the

vent, where  it  is  also joined by niditamentary organs                                                                                                                                                                        one  elongated,  the  other

structure these seemed to be composed of small globular bodies. The testis con-

tained globules, probably endosmosed spermatozoa ; the ovary, evident ova. The

female specimen was a good deal the larger, and the tail more obtuse than in the

male.

                      By E. E. Lank ESTER and H. N. Mosely.

   The authors pointed out the arbitrary and misleading nature of the division of
teeth into incisors, canines, premolars, and molars, since to these terms might
fairly be added sectorial, bicuspid, tricuspid, laniary ; secondly, they show that
maxillary and premaxillary are the only divisions admitting of homological identi-

fication, the maxillarj' teeth being further divided into an anterior and posterior
series in most diphyodonts, by means of the fovu-th so-called premolar. They
pointed out that there is no homology of upper with lower jaw teeth, and that the
present rule for their identification is most arbitrary and unscientific. They show
that the so-called canine of the mole is a premaxillary tooth, that animal being

thus the only placental mammal with eight premaxillaiy or incisor teeth. The
authors further describe a new tooth in the badger, making its dentition identical

with that of the glutton ; this tooth belongs to that series of " premolars " wliicli
have no milk-predecessors as described by Mr. Flower recently in the dog and pig,
and very rapidly drops out of the jaw.

Notes on the Homologies and Comparative Anatomy of the Atlas and Axis.

                      By Alexanber M.\c\i,is,tv.t., L.li.C.S.I.

It seems to bo a principle in morphology that the gieater the amount of special-

ization of function manifested by any organ, the further does the structure so spe-

cialized depart from the form of the primordial type to which it belongs. This

principle is particularly exemplified in the case of the two upper cervical verte-
bra, the atlas, and the axis, as on account of the special varieties of motion of this
region it is in some instances diflicult to assign to the parts of these bones their

exact positions as serial homologues of the processes in other vertebral segments.

We owe much of our knowledge of the relations of these bones to Cwen, IJathke,

Cleland,  and Robin                                                      but a  few points yet  require to  be                                                                                                                  wrought out with      regard
                                                                      ;

to them, so as to enable us to uiiderstand more clearly the homologies of their

several portions. In order to present a more complete series of relationships be-

tween these bones and the ordinary cervical vertebrpe, the points to be consi-

--dered are the following: (1) the nature and homologies of the bod}', of the axis,

and of the odontoid process; (2) the nature of the preodontoid half-arch of the

atlas (3) the serial homologies of the trans-^-erse .atlantal ligament and of the
                            ;

occipito-axial or check ligament (4) the third occipital condyle of Meckel and
                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

transverse processes of the cervical vertebra; in general, and of these two in par-

ticular.

   These may be briefly summarized thus :
   (1) The odontoid process is the body of the atlas ; a considerable amount of evi-

dence on this point is contained in the 'original paper.

   (2) The preodontoid half-arch of the atlas is considered by Koster as a hsemal
arch by Owen as a h}-papophysis ; but in the author's paper reasons are given

for considering it as an ossified anterior conjugal ligament, like the middle slip of

the stellate thoracic ligament.

   (.3) The transverse ligament of the check-ligaments are serial with the con-

jugal ligament of the ribs.

   (4) The third occipital condyle is homologous with the central part of the orni-
thic and reptilian condyle.

   And lastly, the articular siu-faces of the atlas and occipital bone are striictm-ally

double the anterior part being in series with Luschka's Ilahtcirbel, the posterior
part be'ing probably related to the true oblique process.

On the Transmission of Light through Animal Bodies.

          By Dr. Richakdson, M.A., F.R.S.

   The author exhibited a lamp which he had constructed for transmitting light

throu"-h the structures of the animal body. He believed the first idea that such

transmission could be eflected was given in Priestley's work on Electricity. That

great experimentalist, the Shakspeare of physical science, had observed, on passing

a discharge of a Leyden battery through his finger, that the structm-e seemed to
present luminosity, but the operation was extremely painful. The author had
repeated this expeximent with similar results. Of late years research had been
made with the microscope in the transparent web of the foot of the frog ; and

last year Dr. M'Intosh had shown that young trout coidd be used experimentally,

they beiuo- sufliciently transparent for the investigation of the action of various

poisonous substances on then- internal organs. The suggestion of Dr. M'Intosh

had been acted upon by the author, and the motion of the heart and of the re-

spiration had been observed by direct ocular demonstration while those oroanswere

under the influences of various bodies belonging to the ethjd and methyl series. This

research had led the author to extend the principle fm-tlier ; and he had now ad-

vanced so far that he was enabled to transmit light through various tissues of the

bodies of large animals. He had thought it was best to begin by testing each

tissue separately ; and this investigation had been carried out on nearl}^ all the

structures of the body which admit of being individually examined. The structure

the most diaphanous was the skin ;  after that, and  singularly enough, bone                                                                                                                then
                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

thick membranes ; next, thin superficial muscles, lung tissue, fat, and the dense

tissues of the liver and the kidney. Various lights had been tried, viz. the

electric, the oxyhydrogen, the lime-light, and the magnesium. For all practical

purposes, the magnesium light was the best : it was the most convenient to use,

and the light had the advantage of penetrating deeply. In the lantern wliich the

author exhibited the light was also unattended with heat at the point of observa-

tion, so that the hand could be put in at the brightest illuminating point. The

lamp was made by Solomon, of lied Lion Square. The additions consisted in a

tubular arrangement and a sliding groove. The structure to be examined was placed

in the groove inclosed between two disks of perforated wood, and the object was

surveyed from the further end of the tube. In illustration, a thick piece of bone

(the fiat rib of an ox) was placed in the lantern, and light was distinctly trans-

mitted through it. " It was," said the author, " important to speak with care as

to the extent to which this lantern could be used practically." He did not con-

sider it perfect, but thought it promised results of the greatest interest and value.

In the first place, it might be used for a variety of physiological purposes. Animals

whose tissues were thin, such as fish, could be placed in the lantern, and the con-

dition of their circulation and respiration could be carefully studied under tlie

action of various agents. In the human subject, especiaUy in the young, having

fragile tissues, the thinner parts of the body could be distinctly rendered trans-

parent ; and in a child the bones, imder a somewhat subdued light, could be seen

Ain the arm and vrnst.  fracture in a bone could, in fact, be easily made out, or

growth from bone in these parts. In a very thin young subject, the movements

and outline of the heart could also be faintly seen in the chest ; but the light he

had as yet employed had act been sufficient!}' powerful to render this demonstration

all he could desire. It would be possible, lasth', to see through some diseased

structure, so as to ascertain whether, within a cavity, there was a fluid or a solid

body. The author concluded by stating that his object had been rather to mark

the origin of a new and progressive step than to explain a perfect instrimient, or

record an extended series of successful results.

                    On Effects of Extreme Cold on Organic Function.

                                        Bij Dr. EiCHAEDSON, F.R.S.

   The author passed in brief review his experiments performed at Dundee in

relation to the effects of feezing the centres of the nervous system. He showed

that in the lower classes of animals, such as frogs, the nervous centres can be
frozen for long periods of time, with recovery after entire unconsciousness and

apparent death. The points added on this occasion were in continuation of this
line of research. The author first dwelt on the question whether frozen animals
(such as frogs) respire dming insensibility, and explained that they did not. In
proof of this he said that ivuimals so treated could be placed without harm in gases
which would not support life, such as nitrogen and hydrogen, and could be re-
covered at the precise moment of solution from the frozen state when respiration

was recommencing. He had placed animals in this way in hydi'ogen, nitrogen,
and carbonic acid. In other experiments, when the animal was frozen, it was

immersed in ether, and allowed to lie under the fluid imtil, by the rising of bubbles
of air, indications of returning life were gained : then, taken out, the animal would
recover. The gradual return of heat was thus a pure restorative, and the facts

helped to explain many accounts as to restoration after freezing, which up to this

time had been stated as strongly on one side as the)' were doubted on the other.
The second point considered had relation to the effects on the circulation of freez-
ing the brain. The author here showed that in warm-blooded animals the effect
of reducing the temperature of the brain was to produce a gradual slowness of the
circulation, and, when the freezing was carried to the lower part or base of the
brain, to produce the condition of heart and pulse known as intermittency, fol-

lowed, if the operation were continued, by the entire cessation of the heart's
movement. This was a point of great practical moment as indicating the influence
of the brain on the heart. Whenever the brain was reduced in physical power, as
from intense mental fatigue, or shock, or anxiety, ii'regular action (intermittency of
the heart) was almost the necessary result. Most people were conscious of this, and
often thought with great alarm that they were suffering fi'om disease of the heart,
when in fact they were merely labouring under temporary exhaustion of the brain.
The third point went to show that under the influence of extreme cold on the
nervous centres (the brain and spinal cord) the extreme effect of such active poi-

sons as strychnine could for a time be entirely suspended. This raised a hope that

in such diseases as tetanus, a new and successful mode of treatment might be gi-a-
dually evolved. The fourth point had relation to the influence of extreme cold in
preventing and even in removing the rigidity of death. Because the body after
death cools, the inference had been drawn that the rigidity of death was due' to the
process of cooling. This was the exact reverse of the fact. The rigidity of death
was quickened by heat, and prevented by cold, probably for an illimitable period
of time, the cold being sustained. Further, by taking an animal already rigid,
freezing it, and thawing, the first rigidity could be removed and the body become
ffaccid. The last point touched upon related to the effect of freezing and rapidly
thawing the skin of certain regions of the body. It was shown that birds treated
in this manner presented the extremest irregidarity of movement, and other signs
of nervous disturbance. Thus by freezing and rapidly thawing the skin on the

side of the neck of a pigeon, the bird for a time walked sideways in the opposite
direction. The author designated this effect as peripheral nervous shock.

                                   By Edwaed B. Tyloe.

   The treatment of accoimts of the civilization of tribes of man as details of local

geography is connected with a popular notion that these topics are finally dippo!?ed
of by descriptive treatment ; and this notion, in the -n-rfter's opinion, is' prevalent
enough to he a serious obstacle to knowledge. Thus it is far from being a trivial

matter of classification that details of human culture should come mider discussion .is
topics of biology, where, if they have any claim to attention, thc-y must be treated
as facts to be classified and referred to uniform and consistent laws. To show that
the phenomena of civilization, in spite of their extreme difficulty and comjilexilv,
are amenable to such treatment as would be applicable to other biological investiga-
tions in which law and order are to be sought for throughout masses of multifarious
details, was the object of the present paper. Certain special points of culture
taken from language and mythology, were brought foi-n'ard to shovi' how the no-
tion of arbitrary causeless spontaneity in human action di.-appears when phenomena
are classified in their proper gi-oups. In examining the different languages of man-
kind abundant traces are found of the art of counting by word-numbers having
grown up from that primitive plan of counting on the fingers still so familiar to

mankind. Ajjain, as savages have reckoned on their fingeis and toes, it appears to
have struck them that their words for finger, hand, foot, &c. might be used to ex-
press numbers. Thus the Polynesians form the word lima, i.e. ''hand," into a
numeral meaning .5. Thus the Caribs have made words expressing '· L'and," "both

hands," "feet and hands," into numerals equivalent to 5, 10, 20. Even among the
rude nations of West Australia, who are usually found to possess no nimieral be-
yond 2 or ?>, the formation of hand-numerals has locally broken out, as they have
been found to use the expression marh-jin-h(iju/-fia, or " half the hands,'' for 5, and
thence to count on to 15, which they call " tli'e hand on either side and half the
feet." The immense series of facts of which these are illustrative exemplify the
uniform results of a similar process of mental development which has occurred
again and again among remote and savage tribes. As a second instance of such
uniformity, examples were quoted from among a large number of the languages of
the world, in which the interjections of aflirmation and negation display a remark-
able tendency to fall into vowels, mute or aspirated, as aye, ii, hi, Sec. for " yes,"

 and into labials, as aan, nani, kc. for " no." Thirdly, the repeated occurrence in

remote and disconnected languages of the practice of" differentiating" by vowels

pronouns and adverbs of distance, is to be ascribed to the uniform action'of simi-

lar processes. Of this a single instance may be quoted from the Javan language,

(further oft'). .Vgain, the popixlar notion of myths is that they are free and im-
restricted growths of fimcy, and that the study of such baseless, unsubstantial
fabrics of the imagination can lead to no precise or seientific residts. But wider
knowledge must dissipate this idea by showing that myths are intellectual deve-

lopments to be traced to definite causes, like other products of the human mind.
Thus the myth that on a certain hill there was a battle of giants and monsters,

will be probably interpreted by the fact that great fossil bones are really found on

the spot. Again, the story of the presence of a race of men with tails in a parti-

cular district is apt to indicate the real existence of a tribe of aborigines or outcasts,

like the Miautsze of China or the Cagots of France. The author dwelt especially
on two " philosopliic myths,'' invented again and again in the iufaucy of science to
account for strictly physical phenomena. The Polynesian myth of Mafuie, the
subterranean god who causes the earthquake by shifting from shoulder to shoulder
the earth which he carries, and many other similar myths, come under the common
heading of myths of an earth-bearer, formed in various regions to account for the
occun-ence of earthquakes. The myth of the Guarauis of Brazil, that a jaguar and
a huge dog pursue the sun and moon and devour them, which causes eclipses, is

an instance from the widespread group of eclipse-myths of a similar kind. On

this and other evidence the writer argued for the possibility of discovering in the
phenomena c;f ci^ilization, as in vegetable and animal structure, the presence of

distinct laws, and attributed the now backward state of the science of culture to

the non-adoption of the systematic methods of classification familiar to the natu-

ralist.

GEOGEAPHT AND ETHNOLOGY.

Address hy Capt. Kichabds, li.N., F.Ii.S., President of the Section.

Ox the present occasion of opening the Section of Geography, and the science which
has been associated with it, it is not my pui-pose to impose upon you any set address,

or to enter into any of the detail of geographical research during the past year

and my reasons for departing from what appears to have grown into a practice of

mylate, are, first, that the nature of  official duties have not left me the leism-e

to do so ; and secondly, the geographical events of that period have been so amply

dealt with by the President of the Uoyal Geographical Society, in his Annual

Address delivered in May last, and printed in the Society's Proceedings, that a

repetition of them seems unnecessary, and would probably be wearying. I .shall,

therefore, 'SA'ith your indulgence, in the few remarljs which may occur to me on

this occasion, confine myself to a consideration or biief review of the general state

cif our geograj)hical knowledge, adverting to those portions of the earth's surface

to which the attention and the labours of future explorers may he advantageously

directed, and dwelling briefly on the results which are certain to follow those

labours in the interests of knowledge and science, and of humanity, no less than

in those of the national honour and credit, keeping in view, so far as I may, the

present and the futiu-e, rather than the past.

The Science of Geography, as accepted in its ordinary and every-day sense, is

^^^thin easy reach of us all : it requires no abstruse knowledge to follow its study

or its discoveries, or to unravel its mysteries, if there are any ; thus the navigator,

the traveller, the ordinary observer may be, and are, geographers in this sense

yet, regarded under its many aspects, each of them bearing practicall}' more or less
on all that concerns the existence and well-being of the human race, limited only

by the earth's surface which it is its province to describe, embracing as it does,

within its sphere, most other branches of physical science, it must be confessed

that is not the least important of them, nor is it sarjjrising that it should be one of

the most popular, or that men should have been found in all ages ready to sacrifice

their ease and comfort, their fortunes, or to hazard their lives in the pursuit of any

geographical adventure which might seem to otter a possible or even impossible.

path to fame and distinction,
laa REPORT--1868.

   In tracing the history and progi'ess of geogi-aphical discovery, we find that mari-

time exploration always has been, and indeed necessarily always must be its pre-

cursor. When the coasts of h country have been thoroughly explored and defined

on the map by the aid of astronomy and other branches of science, then, according

to various circumstances (to the nature of the climate, the character and extent of
the population, and other physical conditions), Avill the geographical features of
the interior be developed with greater or less rapidity : all history and experience

confirms this, and there are not wanting familiar instances within om" own obser-

vation.

   Wherever, then, it has been possible for navigation to penetrate, there the shores

of the world are sufficiently known for all the purpose of geography proper,
although in the interests of navigation itself, and of the commerce and intercourse of
nations, we have ever been, and probably ever shall be, as long as the world lasts,
adding to and refining on this knowledge. The science then, indeed, assumes
other phases, such as Hydrography, and the Meteorology^ and Physical Geography
of the ocean, the latter becoming every day of more interest and importance in a
practical point of view, and therefore demanding in a proportionate degree the

aid of science in its development.
   In the physical geography of the ocean must be included a knowledge of its

depths, the natm-e of its bed, its temperature, its currents at the sm-face and beneath
the sm-face, and other information necessary to meet the requirements of the present
age : for instance, without this knowledge it would not have been possible success-

fully to lay the submarine cables which now connect Great Britain -with America,

and which it is reasonable to suppose, so soon as the requirements of commerce shall
justify the outlay of the capital, will be followed by siniUar ones, until the whole
globe is encircled. France and America are about to be united bj^ such a tie : a cable
will probably be shortly laid through the centre of the Mediterranean Sea, connec-
ting Gibraltar, ^Nlalta, and Alexandria, thence through the Red Sea, and across the
Indian Ocean to Bombay ; a portion of this will certainly be completed within
a few weeks. The connexion of India with China on the one hand, and with

Australia and New Zealand on the other, will probably not be long delayed. These

great undertakings require not only a Imowledge, but a very accurate knowledge
of all the conditions I have mentioned, the obtaining of which demand an amount
of skill and patience and perseverance on the part of both engineers and seamen,
which those not fully con^-ersant ^\'ith the subject can little conceive. Our efforts,
then, of late years have been directed to this end, and by the aid of science, and
the modern mechanical appliances it has supplied, instead of the vague and imper-

fect knowledge which we possessed up to a comparatively late period, we are now
in the possession of far more accurate data : we know the depth and nature of the

bed of the North Atlantic between Europe and America by three different routes,
and that it does not in an}' part much exceed two geographical miles, or about
13,000 feet. The Mediterrranean Sea has been accurately measm'ed, and its
gi'eatest depth has been found scarcely less than that of the Atlantic. But a few
weeks since the Indian Ocean, between the Red Sea and Bombay, and over other

portions, has been sounded with remarkable accuracy, the maximum depth ob-

tained being something over two geographical miles. Between China and Aus-
tralia a gTeat portion of the distance has been accurately examined, and the re-
mainder is at present in progress ; Vv'hile but a few days since accounts have been
received of the bottom of the sea having been reached in the South Atlantic, be-
tween the Cape of Good Hope and the Equator, the greatest depth obtained being
18,000 feet, or nearly three geographical miles : and no doubt or uncertainty exists
in any of these operations, for in all cases the bottom has been brought up in con-
siderable quantities. I caiinot myself but regard these results as of infinite impor-
tance, and second to none of the geographical discoveries of past years ; many of

them, indeed, are the results of the past year.
    In connexion -with this subject, I would desire to call the attention of those in-

terested in it, to a series of Pliysical Charts of the Atlantic Ocean, lying on the

table ; they are among the latest of the labours of the Hj'drographical Department

distant time they will be followed, I trust, by a similar series for the Pacific and

Indian Oceans.

Following- up the progress of geographical discovery from early times, and

imder conditions which have been the most favom'able, we find that in Europe

and over the greater portions of North and South America, where freedom of in-

tercom'se and travel are unrestricted, we have coniparativelj^ little to learn.

Over the gi-eater part of Asia also, throughout the great Empires of China and

Japan, there is no reason to doubt but that the science of Geography is well imder-

stood and cultivated, although from the peculiar customs and institutions of these

coimtries, and the jealousy of their rulers, they are still in a great measure closed

to the observation and enterprise of Eiu-opeans.

Of that neutral ground, as it were, in Central Asia, between the northern fron-

tiers of India and the southern boundaries of the Russian Empire, and in Western

Tartarj^, which has been attracting much attention lately, there is yet much to
learn, although through the zeal and enterprise of our own Indian officers on the one

hand, and from the Russian armies of exploration, not to say encroachment, on the

other, we are adding something to our knowledge each succeeding year ; and but

a few weeks since a traveller left these shores, under the auspices of the Royal

Geographical Society, in the pursuit of new geographical encroachments in this

region.

   Even with the geography of the A'ast groups of Islands strewed over the Pacific
and Indian Oceans, we are for the most part tolerably acquainted, thanks to mari-
time discovery, in many cases aided hy the labours and researches of the church

missions, which have taken no inconsiderable share in the work. But there is an-

other side to the picture, and it must be confessed that it is a darker one. If we

turn to Africa, even to Australia, to New Guinea, to Borneo (to that sealed book

of the north lying almost at our very threshhold), the mind can barely contem-

plate the vast problems that geography has yet to solve, and we almost sicken at
the reflection how little (how comparatively little) has resulted from all the great

efforts and noble sacrifices which have been made by individuals in our own time

and in the times before us.

Let us turn to Australia : here a great English nation may be said to have

sprung up within the present generation, and yet scarcely more than a corner of it

can be considered as fairly occupied ; with its sea margin alone, and not even all

that, are we thoroughly acc^uainted ; and notwithstanding the dauntless energy and
courage of the numerous explorers, too many of whom have given up their lives in

the cause, it is no exaggeration to say that by far the greater part of the interior

of this sea-girt continent is as little known as it was when Cook first visited its

shores a huudi'ed years ago.

   In the interest, then, of any future explorations, the question seems to arise.

To what causes are we to attribute the comparatively small measure of success
which has hitlierto been attained ? It may be that there are undertakings beyond the

scope of individual enterprise, or indeed of any enterprise not under the direct aid

and auspices of a government ; doubtless great physical difficulties existed, yet

they  were not in  most  instances underrated                                                                                                                                                                           means  and resources may have  been
                                                                                                                                           ;

inadequate, organization and combination may have been wanting ; but j';· this as

it may, it is cercaiu that as yet no etl'ort has been made commensurate with the

Adifficulties to be overcome and the importance of the results to be gnined.                                                                                                                                                                           per-

fect knowledge of the geography of a country must doubtless inevitably follow, and

not precede occupation and civilization                                                                                                                                                                                 but these conditions exist now to a certain
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

exteut'in Australia, and it does seem that the time has come when a combined eftbrt

should be made to clear up what must be almost considered a reproach to geogra-

phy. Those who have read or studied the history of geogi'aphical discovery, can-

not fail to have remarked how seldom any great results have been attained until

after repeated efforts and many failures, and how often, when hard-earned experi-

ence has made success seem almost certain, the prize has been relinquished when

almost within our grasp. This can scarcely remain the case long as regards

Australia : an organized exploration of the interior indeed has been proposed, and

is still mider consideration; it has received the warm approval and countenance of

the Geographical Society, before which a paper has been read on the subject by its

autlior, Dr. Neuniayer, a resident of Australia, and intimately connected ^Titl^ most
of its scientific intitutions ; but on a question of such dimensions no Societj' can do
more than give its sympathy : it is a problem for the united go'^'ernments of
Australia to solve, and it is to be lioped that when undertaken it will be with

such adequate means, organization, and cooperation, both afloat and on shore,

as vs'ill render failure impassible.

   There is yet another terra incof/nita almost within view of the northern coast of

Australia, in the great island of New Guinea, whose shores even have scarcely been

correctly traced on the map. It has been visited, however, by navigators of dif-

ferent countries, and there is little doubt but that, like the smaller islands in its
neighbourhood occupied by the Dutch, it is rich in all the choicest products of the

earth.

It is to be feared, however, that the time is distant when this interesting coimtry

will be opened up to commerce  and civilization                                                                         its great extent,  and the  hostility

of the natives, among other causes, place it far beyond the reach of any individual

eftbrts, and none of the maritime nations seem yet prepared or disposed to set their

mark upon it.

I am unwilling to leave these southern regions without a few passing words on

that latest acquisition, and perhaps most flourishing dependency of the British

Empire, New Zealand : as an instance of the rapidity and success of exploration

and colonization almost coincident witli each other, it is probablj' the most remark-

able in the annals of the world's history ; undoubtedly it possesses in a high de-

--gree almost all the conditions favourable to .such a result an extent of country

equal to Great Britain, of a form and distribution the most favourable for develop-

--ment by nautical exploration, with a climate admirably suited to Europeans it

seemed indeed to invite civilization.
   Scarcely thirty years ago almost its sole white occupants were a few English

missionaries, who, indeed, have generally been the pioneers of civilization in these
distant regions ; ten years later, when colonization was first seriously undertaken on
a great scale, the sagacious nobleman then at the head of the navy, Lord Auckland,
foresaw that the shortest and most certain road to success was a complete nautical
survey of its coasts, which, under his auspices, was at once commenced, and com-
pleted within seven years. Dm'ing this interval colonization progressed with rapid

Newstrides ; and at the present time, despite the drawback of j^ears of native wars.

Zealand, or, as it has well been called, the (4reat Britain of the south, is peopled
throughout its length and breadth by Englishmen, in the possession of the luxuries,

wealth, and prosperity of an old and long settled country.

  There is one incident in the history of New Zealand which is not generally

known or remembered, and it is an instance of what momentous results to a whole
nation may sometimes arise from apparently trifling or accidental causes. The in-

--cident is this : that but for the fortuitous presence of a little brig of war there in,

I think, the year 1830 or 1840, commanded by the late Captain Owen Stanley, a
name that will be lamiliar to many in this old city, that flourishing country, or at
any rate the largest and fairest portion of it, would now have been imder the flag of

another nation, and there would have been the singular coincidence of a second

English Channel at the Antipodes, with our opposite neighbours looking at us

across what is now known as Cook's Straits.

I now turn to Africa, fruitful, if in no otherrespect hitherto, yet certainly in geo-

graphical adventure and daring; and if we do not approach the subject without

hope as to its future, I think we must do so with feelings of misgiving and doubt.

It is a mighty subject, full of the weightiest interests to millions of the human

--race too weighty, indeed, to be more than touched upon here ; and the few words

--I shall say ^^·ill have reference chiefly to the great oljject of iuterest to English-

men at the present time the fate of the great traveller whose life has been so in-

timately associated with Africa, and who for the last two years and a half has been

wandering almost single-handed over that great continent, in pursuit of the objects

to which that life has been mainly devoted. For all wo know of the interior of

Africa we are indebted almost entirely to our own adventurous countrymen, and

Welet us inquire briefly what do we know.                                                                               know that a vast chain of lakes

exist, reaching nearly from the Zambezi on the south to the head waters of the

Nile on tlie north, tlioug-h of their extent, their heig-ht, physical features, and the
functions which they perform in relation to the mighty rivers of the great continent,

much as we do Imow, much more is still left to conjecture ; we know that the climate

of the high lands of Central Africa is not unfavourable to the European constitution

--that it has, or had a dense population, and has the resources of legitimate com-
--merce and wealth within itself that slavery, ^vith its concomitant evils, exist in

their most appalling forms, encouraged and fostered by the traders of nations pro-

fessing to be civilized or semicivilized ; but the one thing hopeful we do know is,

that it is undoubtedly within the power of any civilized nation, and especially of

this great country, which has banished slavery from its own empire and from the

sea, to adopt measures wJiicli at an inconsiderable cost would strike an effectual

blow at the source of tliis great e-(-il. I have said that we have gained all this
knowledge through the enterprise of our own countrymen. No words of mine

could add anything to their well-earned fame. There will doubtless always be

such men found who, for honour and renown, and in the search of knowledge and

the love of science, will be ready to devote their means and their lives to such en-

terprise. Livingstone was not insensible to any of these high motives, but with

--him they were secondary and entirely subservient to the great dream and aim of

his life the blotting out of slavery in Africa and the regeneration of the race.

   I am anxious now, if I can, to make it plain what are the probabilities or otherwise

asto the safety of our great traveller. There is a mistiness on the subject in the
minds of the public o-enerally which is not surprising, and there is an anxiety

among most of us which is natural, and for which, hopeful as many are, there is
but too much reason. Livingstone has been in Africa now for two years and a
half, and for eighteen months he has not been personally heard from. He left on

his last expedition, it will be remembered, in March 1866, disembarking at the
mouth of the Rovuma river, on the east coast, accompanied by eight of his own
liberated Afi-icaus and ten natives of the Comoro Isles, who have since gained an
unenviable reputation among geographers as the Johanna men. His intention was
to strike the north end of Lake Nyassa with the view of settling the question as to

its connexion with the North Lakes, and then to proceed on to Lake Tanganika

the hostility of the natives, however, in this region frustrated these plans, and he
consequently bore away and crossed Nyassa at its southern end. Shortly after-

wards he was abandoned by the Johanna men, who returned to the coast with a

circumstantial account of his murder" and of that of his whole party ; and here,

without being the advocate of these much-abused individuals, let me say a few

words which I think are in justice their due. They were hired with beads and
calico, and were bound to Livingstone by no other ties : during their jom-ney to
Nyassa they had been in imminent peril of being murdered by other savages, and
as they preferred their own lives to roaming through Africa in pursuit of what
they may be excused for considering a tour of mere curiosity, they took the first

opportunity of retm-ning, and like a good many other savages of different colours,

they excused what they probably felt was a rather shabby proceeding bj^ a resort

to falsehood.

   I have never, I confess, been able to understand why so much obloquy and vir-
tuous indignation has been expended on these savages, or why so high a standard

of morality should have been expected of them; I suspect Livingstone himself
would have been slow to condemn them : it was his custom to surround himself

with people whose safety was dependent on his own safety, and no doubt if he
could have got the JNIizitu tribes between them and the sea, the Johanna men

would have remained faithful to him. Howe-S'er, their story was generally credited,

and Sir lioderick Murchison was among the few who doubted it principallj', I
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

may say entirely, through his exertions a small expedition was sent out by the

Government under AIi-. Young, of the Royal Navy, to ascertain the truth or false-
hood of the report. jNIr. Young ascended the Zambezi and the Shire, and carrying

his steel boat over the cataracts with great labour and perseverance, he got on to
Lake Nyassa, where he soon obtained abundant proof that Livingstone had passed

on in safety towards Lake Tanganika. Mr. Young returned early in this year, and

has written an accoimt of his successful search.

   From Lake Nyassa to the native settlement of Ujiji on the east side of Tanganika,
--126 REPORT 1868.

where Livingstone's course was now directed, is over 700 miles, and liy a letter

received from himself, dated Bemha, 1st February, 1867, and brought to Zanzibar

by traders, we know of his safety up to that date ; he had then 400 miles to travel
before reaching- Ujiji, which he expected to do in June. He described in this

letter the hardships he and his seven natives had suffered from h\mger, the loss of

his medicines, which was a real loss, and, to use is own words, he was little more

than a bag of bones ; still he wrote hopefully and in good spirits, as no one ever

knew him otherwise, and this is the last positive information we have of

Livingstone.

   An ivory ti-ader, who left Ujiji on October 6, 1867, and arrived at Zanzibar early
in February 1868, reports that Livingstone had not reached that place when he left,

but that he was expected, and that ten days afterwards he heard from native report

that he had an-ived a few days subsequently ; therefore we have indirect informa-
tion of his having reached Ujiji about the middle of October 1867. Before we specu-
late on his subsequent operations we may premise that he would have lost no op-

portunity of writing to Zanzibar an account of his discoveries up to that time with
his future intentions, and this is the first information we must look for, and most

anxiously we do look for it.

   Assuming, however, that he did reach Ujiji during October 1867, he would have
found there the medicines and other small supplies which were sent him at his own.
request by Dr. Kirk, our consul at Zanzibar ; he would also have learned the dis-

coveries of Sir Samuel Baker, and received his map, by which he would see that he
might, from the head of the Albert Nyanza, pass down the Nile ; but whether,
supposing him to have chosen tliis route, he would have had sufficient goods and
presents to have satisfied the rapacious chiefs whose countries he must have passed

through is very doubtful, indeed unlikely.
   But, arrived at Ujiji, Livingstone's real work would seem but to have begun :

there were great problems to solve ; there was the correct determination of the
height of Tanganilia to be established ; its communication or otherwise with Vic-
toria Nyanza and the new lake of Sir S. Baker, to be ascertained ; the heights of

both these great sheets of water to be corroborated ; the extension of the latter to

the southward and westward; all circumstances intimately connected with the

great question among African travellers, which is the  real  source of the Nile                                                                                   and
                                                                                                                                                               ;

the latter (that is, the extension of Albert Nyanza to the west) perhaps involving

questions of equal importance to geographers, viz. the sources of the Congo and
others of the great western rivers. With so much to do here, Livingstone was not

the man to be lured away by the mere eclat of having traversed Africa from the

Zambezi to the shores of the Mediterranean.

   At Ujiji he woidd, with his people, have required a long rest after the fatigues
of so considerable a journej^ and difficulties and delays may have occun-ed which
it would 1)6 useless here to speculate upon. As to his absence, the work there
was before him is more than sufficient to account for it ; the non-an-ival of any

direct intelligence from himself from Ujiji is the least liopefid feature of the case,

though it is possible to accoimt for this by the irregularity of the an-ival of earners

at Zanzibar; those, liowever, who know the great explorer best are most sanguine
of his safety. Some believe that he may reach the coast b^' the Atlantic, some by

the Mediterranean, and others again by the Indian Ocean. If he is spared to return

to us again, as all who know him must earnestly hope, on personal grounds, as well
as in the belief that there are great things yet for him to achieve, I incline myself

to the belief that it vr\\\ be by Zanzibar; but until some positive information
reaches us of his arrival at ITjiji, it would seem useless to institute a search in any

other direction with a hope of success. Once establish the fact of his arrival or
non-arrival there, which would not appear difficult to do, and the question is re-

duced to far narrower ]n'oportions.

  I now approach a subject of geographical discovery which has always been re-

ceived with favour in this country, viz. the exploration of the North Polar regions,

but in order to a clear understanding of the present state of our geograpldcal

knowledge there, and the prospect of its future, I must revert briefly to the past.

So early as the middle of the sixteenth century the efforts of Englishmen were

directed to the discovery of a passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific by the north,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

                                                                                        TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                        127

or what is called the north-west passage ; not only would such a passage infinitely

shorten the distance to the Pacific and China, but it was the fashion in these days
for each maritime nation to have its own route, and Spain and Portugal, ^vith the
good offices of the Pope, laid claim to the monopoly of the present highways of
Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope. To possess such a short and exclusive
one, therefore, close to our own doors, was a great inducement to persevere
many then were the efforts made, with no approach to success beyond additions to

geographical knowledge, and after the middle of the eighteenth century Ai-ctic en-

terprise appears to have slept for nearly a hundred years. The end of the long war,

however, left the navy without much occupation, and the subject was again revived,

chiefly owing to the able advocacy of the late Sir John Barrow, who was its con-

sistent supporter to the end of his life. The voyages of Parry, Franklin, and others,

in 1819 and subsequent years, to tlie west and the north are" familiar to all. Parry,

however, never succeeded in reaching further westward than Melville Island, in

about the meridian of 115°                                                                                                                              and no .ship has ever since penetrated to the westward

of his. The subsequent expedition of Franklin in the ' Erebus ' and ' Terror,'

which left England in 1845, and was never again heard of until M'Clintock disco-

vered the records of its sad fate in 1857, was the last attempt to discover a north-

west passage, though more in pursuit of scientific investigations than in the belief

that any passage existed which could be turned to practical advantage. But it

was this iuterval of twelve years which was fruitful in Arctic discovery. Expedi-

tion after expedition was despatched by the Government, from the east and from

and with the frequent cooperation of the citizens of another nation (the United

States)                                  who  shared                                    with  us                                                        some important geographical                                                                                                           discoveries ;  and it was

dming these j^ears that the north-west passage may be really said to have been

made by a ship's crew, which entered the Arctic Ocean by Behring's Straits, and

returned nearly four years afterwards by the Atlantic. But no ship has ever yet

passed through this                                                                     frozen                                                          ocean                               though                 from the day that Parry first stood on

Mehille Island (in 1819) and looked out upon it to the westward, no reasonable

doubt could be entertained but that there was water- or ice-communication between

the two oceans.

 --The manner of the accomplishment of this passage was thus : In 1853 M'Clm-e

reached the Bay of Mercy in Banksland, where his abandoned ship, the ' Investi-

gator,' now lies                                                                        at the same                                                     time lay the ' Resolute ' at                                                 Melville                                                 Island, scarcely
                                                                                     ;

more than 150 miles distant; the crew of the former walked over tl.e ice to the

latter, and were conveyed to England in a third ship.

Whether another attempt will ever be made to force this 150 miles of ice or

water is immaterial ; it is certain that it can never be tui-ned to any practical

account ; but that vessels will yet pass from one ocean to the other by this route
many are sanguine enough to believe. The north-west passage, however, has been

settled, and the great question with geographers now, and especially among those
who shared in the labours and the honours of the search for Franklin and his com-

panions, is the exploration of the Polar Sea and the discovery of the North Pole

itself.

   English naval men naturally look upon this as their inheritance, and are very
jealous of it, though it may be in some respects a barren one. Geographers of all

nations, while they earnestly desire its accomplishment, have, with one consent,

generously accorded the honour of its fulfilment to us. The Council of this Asso-

ciation and the Roj-al Geographical Society of London have exerted all their in-
fluence to promote the undeitaking ; the great geographical authoritv of this

coimtry, Sir Roderick Murchisou, has been a consistent and untiring supporter of

Arctic entei-prise, and geographers of all countries are deeply indebted to him, and

have acknowledged their indebtedness                                                                                                                                                                               but I must  take  leave here respectfully to
                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

dissent from Sir Roderick when he infers, as I think he does, in his Annual Ad-

dress, that the disagreement among Arctic men themselves as to the proper route

to be followed has been the principal cause of no action being taken. I cannot

think this : doctors frequently difi'er as to the mode of eflecting a cure, but never-

theless it is very often efl'ected, and by different modes. Geographers may differ as

to the road by which they would                                                                                                                         prefer to reach the Pole                                                                                                              but there  is no Arctic

officer of experience who does not believe tliat he could reach it, whether by Smith

Sound or Spitzbsrgen.

Let it be reiueuiljered that we can never }'et be said to have brought steam to

bear upon Arctic discovery ; that all our costly searching expeditions of late years

have been searching for Franklin, and that all the discoveries they have made have

been incidental to that search. Any one of those expeditions would certainly have

discovered the North Pole if such had been the object ; but even to look toward

the Pole in these days wa? little short of treason. It must be admitted there are

enthusiasts as well as geographers strong on this question : the eminent (rermau

geographer, Dr. Petermann, is so much an enthusiast in the cause, that at his own

cost he has just sent a little vessel of eighty tons, without steam-power, to reach

the Pole between Greenland and Spitzbergen ; I wish I could hope that he would

reap the success he deserve?. But the error which, as I think, the advocates of

Polar exploration have fallen into is that they look upon tlie Admiralty as respon-

sible for the discovery of the North Pole. If there was an enemj' there, or a known

friend in distress, it would undoubtedly be their duty to look after either, but

imder present circumstances, it is no more within their province, as it appears to

me, than to place a squadron of steel gunboats on the lakes of Africa to suppress

slaverJ^ I can imagine tliat nothing would be more congenial to the individual

members of that branch of the Government than to adopt both these glorious ex-

pedients, which would reflect so much lustre ou the country and on themselves
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

but it is the country that must do these things, and if the country wishes them

done and will provide the means, they will be done speedily and efi'ectually. Thy

North Pole is j ust as much a public question, if I may make the comparison, as tlie Irish

Church, and if canvassed, possibly might considerabl}^ afiect the approaching elec-

tions. Perhaps one of the most powerful arguments in favour of Arctic exploration

or Antarctic exploration at the present time is the necessity of educating officers

and seamen in preparation for the great astronomical problem, which must be

solved in a few years' time, as near to the South Pole as we can get ; for it is diffi-

cult to believe that this country v^^ll not take an important part in the solution of

that great problem ; and Arctic seamen will not last for ever, nor can they be made in

a year. I will only add further ou this question of the North Pole, that it appears

to me to be one of those cases of success all but attained, and within our grasp ; and

I trust that the country which has borne the heat and burthen of the daj- will not

be robbed of the crowning honours.

There is another subject connected with geography in which I believe a large

section of the public of this country feel a special interest, and which it would be

improper therefore to pass unnoticed here. I allude to the research which has been,

and is still being carried on in Palestine under the direction of oificers of the Hoyal

Engineers, and to the projected exploration of a portion of the Peninsula of Sinai,

which it is hoped will be shortly commenced.

The latter project originated with the late Captain Butler, of the 5oth Regi-

ment, who made considerable explorations there, but ou the breaking out of the

late war was recalled to his regiment, and subsequently fell at Inkerman. It was

afterwards warmly taken up Ijy his brotlier, the llev. Pierce Butler, supported by

many friends, and but for the sudden and lamented death of the latter gentleman

a few months since, it would doubtless have been now in progress. Tliere is every

Areason to hope, however, that it is only postponed.  few hundred pounds in ad-

dition to the funds in hand will suffice to defray the cost of the undertaking, and a

cause of so much interest is not likely to fail for want of public supjjort. On

the table will be found printed papers setting forth the objects of the expedition

and the results which it is hoped will be attained. I will onl}' add that the name
of Captain Palmer, of the Royal Engineers, who has been selected to conduct the

Survey, is a sure guarantee that it will be well and completely performed.

I have little now to add. I said I woidd dwell brietly on the practical results

which might be expected to follow the geographical research I ha^-e briefly sketched

out ; but it appears to me they almost tell their own tale. There is one great re-

sult, however, I will advert to, and wliich, in the interests of this country and two

--of her great dependencies, I hope will not be long delayed, at least the commence-

ment of it, I mean overland commimication between the dominion of Canada and
                                                                                      ;

Biitisli Coluiubia on tlie shores of the Pacific. It is impossible, I believe, to over-

rate the importance of this work to all concerned ; it will practically imite tliese
two great colonies in British America, and open up a vast and fertile country where

our surplus population may live under their own Hag instead of seeking a home

under another. It must be remembered that we are living side by side on that

great continent with a people second to none in their enterprise and perseverance

that already they have carried a railway from the Atlantic almost to the Pacific,

and that they are completing it under difficulties as great as any we should have

to encounter ; but a few days since I received a letter from our Consul at San

Francisco, in which he says " the Pacific railway is rapidly progressing, and in 1870

passengers will be carried from New York to San Francisco in five dajs." If

British America is to progi-ess under the Hag of this country, and if we are to

maintain our commercial position in the Pacific and in China, we must not be slow

to follow this example geographers have done enough to prove that the imder-
                                                                                                          ;

taking is feasible ; Canada and British Columbia are alive to the importance of it,

and as to the latter, its very existence, I believe, depends upon it.

I will ask your permission still to trespass on your time for a very few moments

on a subject which has lately seriously engaged the attention of the Council of the

Royal Geographical Society, and which will probably be of iaterest to some pre-
sent. I regret very much that Mr. Francis Galton, a distinguished and well-known

member of the Association, should not have been present himself to introduce the

subject to you, for it is a child of his own, and he would have done far more jus-

tice to it than I can. There has been a pretty general feeling among geographers

that, popular as geography is in a practical point of \'iew, it does not receive that

attention at our great public educational establishments which its importance entitles

it to ; and when it is considered and acknowledged how essential an acquaintance with

geography is in the pursuit of the study of histoiy and other branches of education,

this cannot but be regretted. The Council of the Geographical Society, then,

with the countenance of the heads of certain of the principal schools of the

United Kingdom, have decided to offer a certain number of medals to be com-

peted for annually, for the encouragement of the study of geography, the first

competition to take place in May 1869. The pamphlets containing the particulars

of this proposal vn\l be found on the table, and the object of mentioning the

subject here is to invite a discussion on it, and that it may be known before the

meeting of the schools in autumn possibly those present who have sons eligible
                                                                                                                                                                  ;

for the competition may feel inclined to encourage them to compete ; this must

be considered as a first effort on the part of the Council of the Society, and

it is entirely due to Mr. Galton. If attended with success, it cannot be doubted

but that it will be followed b}' further encouragement in the same direction.

  I may not conclude these remarks witl'out expressing my sincere regret (in
which I am sure I shall be joined by all present) at the absence of the man

who, above all others, has done so much for the advancement of the science

which this Section of the Association represents. This Section, indeed, was his

own creation ; and I venture to think it has not been the least of his contribu-

tions to geography, great as they have been. I need scarcelj^ say I allude to Sir

Poderick Murchisou. You will rejoice to know that it is no serious indisposition

which keeps him away from us. In a letter received from him onlj' yesterday he

says to me, " Tell the Section that nothing would have induced me to be absent

from the Association, of which I have been a constant attendant for more than

thirty years, but the absolute necessity of rest." The truth is that he has de-

voted himself to public duties, and especially those connected with our science

dm'ingthe past j'ear, in a manner that would have severely taxed the energies of a
far younger man ; and with all his hopefulness he cannot but have felt deeply the

uncertainty attaching to Livingstone's fate. I believe myself that the hope nearest

his heart is once more to welcome home this great man, great in everv sense of the
word ; and we must all earnestly hope that so fitting a consummation of a lono-
and distinguished public cai'eer may be in store for him.

I am aware tliat it may be questioned whether this is the place or the occasion

to record an obituary notice ; and, indeed, the one I shall allude to has been already

recorded in a more  fitting  place,  and  bv one  more  entitled  to  pronounce it :  but

if I were to omit on their behalf a jiassing- tribute of regard and respect to the

memoiy of one whose benevolent and familiar face -svill be moiu-nfully missed by
many here to-day, and whose long and industrious life was passed, even np to its
latest days, in tlie piu'suit of every object which could tend to the acquisition of
knowledge or the advancement of science--to the memory of John Crawfurd.

   And now it remains only for me to thank you for the patience with which you
have followed me through" these rambling remarks, which have extended fai- beyond

the limits I had intended.

   You will remember that on the occasion of the deliveiy of the President, s Ad-

dress last evening allusion was made by one of the speakers to the " cohesion of
atoms," or the affinity between certain particles. I do not fancy that Professor
Huxley applied the remark iu a scientific or philosophical sense, but rather as a
metaphor implying the attraction or drawing together which existed between two
seafarin"- atoms, such as the President and himself; and it was precisely this feeling
wiiieh, when Dr. Hooker did me the honour to ask me to preside over this Section,

--prevented me from saving what I really felt prompted to say you had better find

a more competent authority ; and this 'is my apology for haA'ing accepted the posi-
tion. I certainly have felt a pride and satisfaction in being associated -svith men

 whose early predilections in the search of knowledge and' of truth led theui to

adopt my profession as affording the widest scope to careers which have since

 ied to eminence, though the very attainment of that eminence has necessarily
 removed both to a sphere of wider and more extended usefidness.

    Isolated by the arid regions which sim-ound it, the elevated region of Abys-
 sinia forms a gem apart in torrid Africa, the perfection of a temperate and healthy
 climate. The people of Abyssinia are a mixed race, tho offspring of divers in-
 vaders ; and it is doubtful if such a thing as a pure specimen of the primordial Abys-

 sinian race at present exists. The Shankalas, a negro tribe who dwell in the

 woods of the low country on the north-western frontier, are certainly not that
 race. They are a dark-skiimed, woolly-haired, flat-nosed people, ignorant and
 fetish-worshipping, clad in the skins of animals and armed with the club. It was
 not probable that they were originally inhabitants of the highlands, driven to the
 malarious jungles which constitute their present abode by a superior race of in-
 vaders. The oldest records represent the Abyssinian race as powerful, enterprising,
  and possessing a civilization superior to that of other African peoples ; and it is
 probable they have since degenerated from their ancient condition. The Abys-
  sinians of the present day are a mixed race, in which the Arab, Jewish, andGalla
  elements are more or less combined. The first of the divisions of the race admitted
  by themselves is the Amhara, a word which serves to designate the majority of
  the population. The Araharas are all Christians. They are a handsome and pre-
  possessing people, well proportioned and with large heads, in which there is but a
  slight preponderance of basilar development. The face is small in proportion to

 -- --the cranium, the eyes large and black, but somewhat devoid of expression, the
 -- --nose straight, or slightly curved, the lips small, often rosy, the beard generally
 -- --scanty, the teeth white and even, the hair coarse, curly, sometimes woolly and

  sometimes long. The hue of the skin varies from dark brown to a dirty j'ellow.
  Tho language is an impure Gecz, with a mixture of Arabic and Galla words. The
  people of Tigrd inhabit the greater portion of the northern provinces. They differ

 --but slightly from the .\mharas ; the head and face are somewhat longer, the
 -- --teeth luoie irregular, long, and prominent, the eyes smallerand brighter, and

  the face more angular ; the hair, especially of the women, is longer and finer.
  They are generally darker than the Amharas, and the Tigre dial'ct has still more
  connexion -with Geez. The people of Lasta seem to combine the best points of
  the Amharas and Tigre nation ; although they are below the middle height they

atrre remarkably well made, and notorious for their strength and anility. They

speak the Tigre dialect. The people of Shoa as a rule are darker an'd taller than

the Amharas, but speak the same language. In Tigre and Shoa a large portion of
the people are Mohammedans. Besides these four sections of Abyssinians there

are several separate tribes. Of tliese, the Falashas are the most important ; they
are found in gi-eat numbers in Wolkait, AVaggara, and Koura, and are imdoubtedly

of Jewish descent. To this day they have retained many of the customs of theii-

race, observing the Sabbath and being very particular in then- food and other ob-

sei-vances of the Mosaic law. Another tribe are the Kammcnts, a peculiar people

inhabiting the district at the north-western extremity of Lake Tana. They re-

semble in appearance the Falashas, and are not improjjably a derivation from the
saine tribe. They observe tlie Jewish Sabbath, and retain some of the Jewish

prejudices. Although they have a sacred language of their own they speak Am-
hai-ic. They are a quiet and inoffensive people,' but so brave in the defence of their

homesteads and sanctuaries that they are but seldom molested by their crafty but

cowardly neighboiu-s the Amharas. "A third tribe are the A(jaics',vf\LO are of Galla

origin, and mhabit districts at the southern end of Lake Tana and to the westward

of Lasta. They are fairer in skin than the Amliaras, have handsome features and

are remarkable for the delicate form of their hands and feet, and for the fine tex-

ture of their hair. The land of the Agaws, bordering on the district of Damot, is

one of the finest provinces of Abyssinia. These Agaws form a wealthy and

powerful tribe. "When Mr. Eassam's mission (of which the author was a member)

passed through their country their hospitality knew no bounds, and their amiable

and courteous manners and pleasing smiling faces will ever be remembered.

Although they have Christian chiu'ches and priests they are not looked upon

as orthodox by the Amharas. They are a courageous people in defence of their

Ahomes, and the Emperor Theodore always took care to leave them alone.
fourth people, the Za/aiis, are rather a caste than a tribe ; they inhabit Dembea,

isolated in small villages, tending their herds of cattle, and are uncouth in ap-
pearance. The Waitos, a fifth tribe, inhabit the shores of Lake Tana, and are

despised on account of their predilection for the flesh of the hippopotamus. They

are expert fishermen and ply the lake in their bulrush canoes. Their hair is short

Aand woolly, but they have lio further resemblance to the negro Shankalas. sixth

tribe, the Fiffens, inhabit a well-wooded country, south of Lake Tana, abounding

Ain elephants, which they hunt, and bring the ivory twice a year to the markets of
Godjani.  seventh and last tribe are the IFallo r/allas, a large, wealthy and

powerful tribe inhabiting the fine plateau that extands from the Bechilo to'Shoa.

They came originally from equatorial Africa about the middle of the sixteenth

century, and are a brave race, professing the Mohammedan religion. Now that

their gi-eat enemy Theodore is no more they bid fair to overrun Abyssinia, and

impose on the_ debauched and sensual Christians the false creed of "the Koran.

There is nothing to praise in the character of the Abyssinians in general.

Beggars infest the land; the priests are ignorant and bigoted. The people

are adepts at low treachery, lazy, pretentious, and pompous. If their timorous

nature made them recoil from th'e daring act of murdering the white men, their

guests, they enjoyed at least for a while the idea of their importance, and swag-

gered, full of pride, before the few helpless individuals their king detained in cap-

tivity and in chains.

   During service in the autumn of 1807 and the spring of the present year, the
author was instructed to proceed to the African coast, between Berenice on the
west and the Egyptian frontier on the east, a region embracing Lybia and that fertile

strip of Africa called the Cyrenaica. It is the author's obiect'to give a sketch of

the condition and nature of the tribes now settled among the plateaux and ruined

sides of its ancient roads and on the faces of tlie vallejs the most artistic and

extensive rock-cut tombs in the world. The excavations conducted by Commander

Porcherand Major Smitli, R.E., had also revealed sculptures not inferior to those

of the best period of Greece. The coast was dangerous to approach by sea, a

defect mitigated dm-ing Roman occupation by the construction of harbours. Gy-

rene is situated on the summit of hills overlooking the sea at a height of 2000 feet.

After the cities were destroyed by successive barbaric invasions on the fall of the

Roman Empire, tribes of Bedouins occupied the region, and pitched their tents under

the shadows of amphitheatres and Christian churches. The fanatical Islamism of

other countries of Northern Africa is unknown amongst the present inhabitants of

the Cyrenaica, who only comply -svith a few of the external forms enjoined by the

Koran. They are incapable of comprehending the signihcauce and grandeur of the

ruined cities they occupy, or of protiting by this beautiful and fertile tract of coun-

--tr}^ The present population consists of three socially distinct classes of Arabs the

.stationarv, or city Ai-ab, the armed Nomads, and the Bedouins. On the eastern

frontier there is a mixture caused by the importation of Nubian or negro slaves.

At Bengazi (the ancient Berenice) may be seen every possible shade of mixture,

the result of cross-breeding. The chief elements are the fair and high-bred Arab,

the tall, well-shaped, black Nubian, and the woolly-haired negro ; a resident

Tm'kish garrison also takes its part in the general mixture. The CjTenaica con-

sists of a long strip of table-land, bounded on three sides by the desert, and on the

fomth by the Mediterranean. Its geological formation consists of limestone, and

the rock is much hollowed by caves. The country is remarkably fertile, and

nothing can exceed the beauty of the scenery on the heights and among the ra-

vines. From the upper plateau, on which Cyrene was built, the land descends in

terraces to the coast, and it is on the slopes of these terraces that the Bedouin wan-

derers are most seen. They are physically a finer set of people than the Bedouins

of Syria, and more warlike and aggressive. When young, their skin is bronzed

but very soft, and their dispositions timid and gentle ; but as they grow older they
become dai'ker, their voices rough, and their manners thievish and treacherous.

The women do much to destroy whatever charm Nature has given them by the

habit of tattooing and, in some tribes, of slitting the right nostril. It is also common

for mothers to lengthen the lower lips of their female children and tattoo the in-

side, carrying over the lines of tattoo down to the chin. The Bedouins keep their

tj'pe pure and their customs distinct ; nowhere can there be detected among them

any mixtm-e of race. Negroes are sometimes emploj"ed as labourers and are treated

kindly                                   but  the  author doubted if the}' are  allowed  to  take  a wife  out  of the  tribe.
                                      ;

The Bedouins with their cattle settle on the maritime plain in the spring and

autumn, obtaining their supply of water, after the rains, from the old Roman

reservoirs or wells. They have but few camels, but goats in abundance. Many

families find excellent shelter in the nmuerous limestone caves, which also serve

for herding the goats. On the plain are numerous surfiice cavities with small

openings, which are used as caches, for the purpose of storing the fodder when the

Bedouins retire to the upper groimds. The rock-cut tombs at CjTene are inhabited

Aby the Sheikhs and other chief Arabs. large entrance, raised slightly above the

road, opens into a chamber of considerable height and size, and this usually com-

municates with smaller chambers formerly used as sarcophagi. In one of these

tombs the author was received by the governor and his staft'on the occasion of his

oflieial visit. The Nomad tribes are dangerous and aggi-essive. The men are never

without their guns, and if superior in numbers are menacing to strangers. They

have a facility for rapidly converging upon any given point in considerable num-

bers                       and although many parts of  the  coast               appear   uninhabited, there     is  no part
                        ;

where, in a few hours, some hundreds of armed Bedouins would not assemble.

On one occasion, when examining some ruins on an apparently uninhabited plain,

covered knee-deep with wild roses, camomiles, and oleanders, the author and

his party of officers and men were sui-prised to obser\-e, in the course of half an

hom-, streams of Bedouins running down the neighbouring ravines to meet them.
The Arab Nomads are not a joyous race; they have no amusements or games,

and by disposition are sullen and" solitary.

Physical Geography of the Queen Charlotte Islands. By R. Beown.

These islands, situated off the north-west coast of America, were first discovered

by Juan Perez in 1774, in the Spanish corvette ' Santiago ; hut they owe their
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        '

designation to Capt. Dixon, of the merchant ship ' Queen Cliarlotte ', who visited
them in 1787, and applied the name of his ship to the groiip. Of late years the

discovery of copper and gold on these islands, and their proximity to the colony of

Vancouver's Island, had attracted more attention to them                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       but their coast  line is

still imperfectly known and their interior is entirely imexplored. The author

spent a few weeks on them in the spring of 1866, and was enabled to obtain some

information regarding the islands and their productions. The chief islands are

three in number, separated by two narrow channels. Their western shores are

much more rugged and ])recipitous than their eastern sides. Deep sovmds enter

the coasts in many places dividing the land into numerous peninsulas. The whole

sm'face is densely covered -^v-ith forests, chietiy of coniferous trees aud a thick under-

gro-R"th of shrubs, rendering land exploration extremely difficult ; it is possible, how-

ever, to investigate a large portion of the country by boats through the narrow

inlets, which in some cases nearly meet from opposite sides. The forests contain

no deer, and are nearly destitute of large game for food. The general geological

structure of the islands appears to be beds of conglomerate, coal, and metamorphosed

sandstone resting on erupted greenstone. The coal has all the appearance of an-

thracite, altered by igneous rock in a remarkable manner. Two companies have

made efforts to work these mines, but hitherto without much success, the seams

of hard anthracite being varied with masses of soft powdery material, like wet

Agunpowder.  fine slate associated with the coal is easily carved, and is exten-

sively used by the Indians for making ornaments, such as elaborately ornamented

pipes, flutes, images, &c., for sale to the whites and many have found their way
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

to European museums. In the metamorphosed sandstone, casts of a bivalve shell

are seen in considerable numbers. Copper, chiefly in sulphates and carbonates,

has been foimd at several places. Though situated so far north (between 51° 55'

and 54° 20' N. lat.), the climate is much milder than that of the mainland further

south. Great humidity prevails, as in the rest of the zone of coastland north of

Frazer river, aud includmg Sitka. On the 1st of April, when the author first

landed, all the snow had disappeared from the lowlands, and the weather was mild

and pleasant ; towards the end of the month humming-birds made their appear-

ance. The Indians (who are still the only permanent inhabitants) are known by

the general name of Hydahs, and form one homogeneous people. Physically they

are a finer race than is anywhere to be seen on the North American continent. The
women are very good-looking, often tending to enibonjwiiit ; but they have a cus-

tom of disfiguring the lower lip by transfixing it with a large bone ornament,

causing the lip to protrude in a shell-like form. Both men and women have erect,

tall figures. The head is well formed, and not disfigured by compression, as in

most of the southern tribes. Their hands and feet are small, and well shaped.

The colour of the skin is fair, and in the women there is a mixture of red and

white in their cheeks not seen in any other American race. The eyes are hori-

zontal. Few of the men have any beard or whisker, but some have a bushy

moustache and " imperial." Tattooing is sometimes practised, in patterns, on the

back of the hands and arms, and, in the womeu, a few slight streaks on the cheeks.

The average height of the men is o feet 10 inches, some of them reaching 6 feet,

and their gait and bearing are dignified, totally different from the lounging, wad-

dling walk of the flathead tribes of ^'ancouver's Island. The Hydahs are bold

warriors, but cruel and vindictive ; though generallv friendly to visitors they are

not to be trusted, and have been guilty of attacking and nuirdering the crews of

small trading vessels. The claim of territorial rights and famil}- pride prevail to

a great degree amongst these people. Every head man has his arms, which are

beautifully engraved on large copper plates in most grotesque quarterings, aud on

boxes and other articles belonging to his family. The plates are about 3 feet long

by ly broad, rather arched, and about a quarter of an inch thick. The Hydahs

excel all other tribes of the red man in artistic skill, especially in carving, although

their only tools are generally a broken knife and a file. Gold bracelets of elegant

design, busts in slate and ivory, and designs for iron railings to public buildings in
Vancom'er's Island have been executed by individuals of this tribe. Engravings

of xVssyrian sculptures in the ' Illustrated London News ' have served them for

copies of these objects in slate. Their language differs from that of all other Indian
languages of North America, and is spoken with slight variations throughout the
islands ; the author stated his intention of giving the vocabulary he had noted
down, in a general accoimt of the Indian languages of North-western America

which he was about to publish. No sort of cultivated plant is grown by the

Hydahs except potatoes, which are produced in greater abundance than by any
other Indian tribe, and are of excellent quality.

On the Formation of Fiords, Canons, Benclies, Prairies, and Intermittent

                              Eivers. By E. Browij.

  With regard to fiords, or deep narrow inlets in hiUy sea-coasts, the author pointed
out that they existed only in high latitudes. They varied in length from two or
three miles to one hundi'ed or more, and were known by the different names of
inlets, canals, fiords, and lochs. Their nature was everywhere similar, so much
so as to suggest a common origin. The author had investigated them on the north-
west coast of North America ; the soundings in them showed a great depth of
water, high precipitous cliffs hemmed them in on both sides, and at their he.ad a

valley generally existed. They existed on the western side of Vancouver's Island,

but not on the eastern, showing that the island once formed part of what is now

British Columbia, its western coast being then the shore of the contiment. Jervis

Inlet might be taken as the tj'pe of these inlets ; it is forty miles in length, while
its -wddth rarely exceeds one mile and a half; the depths below almost rival the
heig'hts of the precipitous sides ; bottom is rarely reached under 200 fathoms, even
close to the shore. The author concluded that glaciers were the agency by which

inlets were scooped out, in all parts of the world where they are now seen. Every-

where in British Columbia marks of ice-action are seen on the sides of the fiords.
Not far fi-om the heads of most of them glaciers are newfound in the Coast Range
and Cascade Mountains, and marks of old glacier-action can be seen 2000 to -3000
feet below the summit, and even near the sea-margin. Canons, or the deep ravines

through which many rivers of Western America for many miles pursue their course,

the author attributed to erosion by the ffu-\-iatile currents, the action of which
was stronger during the period when glaciers filled the northern fiords, and when
the atmospheric precipitation would be much greater over the whole region than it
is now. Benches, or terrace-like formations on tlie sides of narrow river valleys,
far above the present level of the rivers, were due to sudden sinkuigs of the level
of the rivers, on the wearing or breaking down of rocky baniers which impeded
their course, thus leaving the traces of their old beds in the form of " benches."
The existence of Prairies, or treeless plains, in the interior of North America was
attributed by the author to the same cause as the formation of steppes and deserts

in other parts of the world, namely, the deficiencj^ in the rainfall in the interior
of continents. Under the head of "intermittent rivers" the author enumerated
the streams of this natm'e that he had observed on the eastern side of the Cascade

Mountains in Oregon and Washington Territorj^, and explained them by the general
aridity caused by tlie interception of the rain-supply from the Pacific by the Cas-
cade Range, by the sudden melting of the snows on the Rocky Mountains, where
the rivers mostly take their rise, and l\v the cavernous, volcanic natm-e of the sur-

face.  .

                      On the Scjyidchral liemains of Southern India.

                        By Sir Walter Elliot, K.S.I. , F.L.S.

   In most parts of India ancient monuments of the dead are found, the relics of
people that no longer exist, or whose descendants, if not wholly extinct, do not

now resort to the same practices. Tlie most common kind are circles of rough

stones placed close to each other, in which are deposited one, or sometimes two or

three terra-cotta vessels containing biu-nt bones and beads or metal utensils.

Others of greater pretension are formed by fom- large stone slabs inclosing a

square space, and covered by a fifth slab forming a lid. The fi'ont stone, in some

cases, has a circular hole in the centre or at the upper edge, which the country

people believe to be an entrance to the dwellings of an aboriginal race of dwarfs.

Sometimes the structures, which pass under the general name of randu-ladis, are

oblong, and consist of two slabs on each side and two covering stones. These are

occasionally divided by an internal slab into two chambers. The JPandu-kuIis are

for the most part above groimd, but some have been found below the surface and

covered with earth. Another sort is peculiar to the Malabar or Western Coast

and the table-land above it. They consist of a subterranean chamber, excavated

to receive an earthen vessel 4 or u feet deep and 3 or 4 in diameter, like a Roman

amphora, containing the relics, the whole covered by a large discoid stone," which,

from its resemblance to a native kodi or umbrella, has received the name of Kodi-

kal. Similar convex slabs, propped on three or fom* upright stones, occur with

them, and bear the name of Topi-kals or "cap-stones; " out no remains have been

found under them.

The structures on the Nilagiri Mountains in Southern India, which fonned the

more immediate subject of the paper, diifer from all these. Some, crowning the

summits of the hills or elevated ridges are circular walls, constructed of rough

stones, having much the appearance of the old-fashioned draw-well. Others are

Aformed of tall, unhewn stones set on end, and inclosing a circular space.  third

kind are excavated and lined with similar upright slabs, from which the earth

Aoutside slopes down on all sides.  fourth description are conical earthen mounds.

In all these, however much they differ in form, the internal arrangement is the

same. On digging out the soil from the inner circle one or more horizontal nar-
row slabs are discovered, always lying N.E. & S.W., the intervals between which

and the external boundary are filled with broken pottery of a peculiar character,

being the remains of tall cylindrical vases, without feet or handles, formed of a

succession of rings, as if turned on a lathe, with lids surmoimted by grotesque

figures of men or animals, aud sometimes by monstrous shapes, the products of the

potter's fancy. Underneath each horizontal stone is a flat vessel of finer pottery

containing the deposits, general!}^ consisting of fragments of burnt bone, gold

ornaments, metal cups and tazzas, iron (or more rarely, bronze) implements, as

knives, spear-headS; sickles, razors, &c., mixed with a little fine black or brown

mould.

The paper then went on to describe minutely the excavation of two of the more

remarkable deposits, with the articles found in each, and concluded by an inquiry

into the people who had formed them. These were traced to a race called Cu-

rumbars, formerly the dominant inhabitants of the Dekhan. They professed the

Buddhist faith, were eminent for the culture of literatm-e and the arts, but were

destroyed utterly in a religious persecution headed by a Chola King of Tanjore, in

the sixth century. This would give the tombs an antiquitj- of from 1600 to 2000

years. The sera so assumed is supported by the fact of a number of irregrdar-

shaped silver punch-coins ha^ing been found in a kudi-kal tomb in Coimbatore,

which were exactly similar to another deposit discovered in the same district, among

--which was a denarius of ^Vugustus by no means a rare occurrence, a large number

of Roman coins having been dug up from time to time not oidy in Coimbatore,

but in other parts of Southern India.

  On the Peninsula of Sinai, and its Geor/rajDliical Bearimjs on the IIistor)j of
                     the Exodus. By the Eev. P. W. Holland.

   The author had twice wandered through the Peninsula of Sinai on foot, tracing its
wadys, chiefly with a ^iew to ascertain the route of the Israelites. The author
discussed, in the first place, the evidence for fixing the position of Mount Sinai
itself. The long range of Jebel Tib, forming a remarlvable barrier across the pe-
ninsula, enables us to decide that the Mount must lie to the south of this line ; and

·within this limited region the claims of three mountains had been adTocated.

Of these, the first, Jebel Odjmeh, in no -way met the requirements of the Bible
narrative, being a mountain not apart from otliers round which bounds could be

placed. The second, Jebel Serbal, was excluded by reason of its having no plain
before it, and being approached only by narrow, rocky wadys. The third, Jebel

Miisa, the " mountain of Moses," standing alone and rising abruptly from the plain

of Wady Er Rahar, seemed to answer most of the requirements, and is, the author

believes, the true Mount Sinai. Yet there are many who believe that the plain

in fi'out of it, which is only two miles long and scarcely half a mile broad, is too
small for the encampment of the Israelites. The author was surprised last year to

discover another plain, similarly situated, at the foot of an imposing mountain, which

was at least four miles broad and seven miles long; aiid this being only eight miles
distant from Jebel Musa, is a striking proof of liow little we jet know of the topo-

Umgraphy of the country. This plain is called Senned, and its mountain Jebel

Alowee. Up to within the last five miles, the road which leads both to Jebel

Musa and Jebel I'm Alowee is identically the same ; so that if the latter be
ever brought forward as a rival Mount SinaiJ^Twill in no way tend to unsettle
any opinions that may be formed with regma to the previous route of the Is-

raelites. The author next described the situation of llephidim, which he be-

lieved he had satisfactorily determined to be at a spot about twelve miles to the

north of the two mounts, where there is a narrow pass tln-ough a granitic range,

formed by the "Wady Es Sheikh, suitable as the post of defence of the Amalekites.

All the requirements of the scriptural account of the battle of Rephidini were found

at this spot. With regard to the route of the Israelites before reaching this point,

the author belie'^'ed that further research might possibly pro-\e that a large plain

called Es Seyh, south of .lebel Tih, extending for a distance of nearly thirty miles,

had the highest claims  to be considered the                                                                                                                                            IVilderiicsa of  iS'iu                  the distance  from

the south-eastern end of which to Eephidim was about thirty miles, and would

correspond with the three daj-s' march of the Israelites. Along this they may
have marched after their journey along the sea-coast as far as Wady Ghurimdel,

and inland round the back of the headland of Jebel Ilummam to Wady Useit.

The author had an-ived at the conclusion that no great change in the features of

the peninsula of Sinai had taken place since the remote period of the Exodus.

On the Nomade Races of European Russia. By H. H. Howoeth.

Russia, as the scene of the latest ethnographic changes, offers a good field to

begin an inquiry into the earlier ethnology of Europe, it being, according to the

author, a more scientific metliod to commence such an inquiry with the known,

Aworking back to tlie unknown, than the reverse process.                                                                                                                                                 wide induction from

facts and a careful balancing of authorities had led him to a generally consistent

--theory on the peopling of southern Russia by successive waves of nomades,

story which is very confused as told Ijy earlier writers. The following is a brief
summary of the results :--In 1030 the Kalmucks first crossed the A^olga with a few

Turcomans in their train. Their number had since decreased verv materially, and

they are all found in the government of Astrakhan. In 1218 the Tartars, or Turcic

race, officered by Moguls, crossed the same river, and subsequently founded the three

Khanates of Kasan, Astrakhan, and Crim, which were successively swallowed up

by Russia. Previous to 1218 tlie valley between the .laik and the Volga, known

as the Kisschabe, was occupied by a corrupt Turcic race, represented mainly by the

Nogais, while in the Western Steppes were found Comans and Petcheneys, both

also Turcic races. The extension of the power of the Khalifat and the spread of

Islamism first brought the Turcic races in contact with the Volga. In the ninth

--and tenth centuries they drove the Ughry out of their settlements, a portion of

them, the Voguls, northwards                                                                                                                                             the rest, the  Magyars,  westwards                     into  Hungary.
                                                                                                                                                                      ;

Preyiously to this date the Turks were unknown in Western Europe. Under

their several names of Huns, Avares, Bulgars, Khazars, and Hungars, or Hungarians,
wave of invaders had succeeded wave across the Steppes, and gradually infiltered

their blood and even a trace of their language into Central Europe. ' But these

races were all Finnic or Ugrian. They all came from the same area, the crowded

cradle-land of Great Bulgaria and Great Hungary, and were essentially the same
race under different names. This southward extension of the Ugrian race (the
underlying race of all the European area) at so recent a period is an important fact,
and seems to ofler a key to the unlocking of that Pre-Aryan period of European

history known as Pre-histoiric.

          To])ogra])hy of Vesuvius, ivith an afcount of the recent eruption.

                           By J. Logan Lodley, F.G.hi.

   The topography of Vesuvius was described in detail in this paper, which was
accompanied by a map showing the points of interest on and around the volcano,
as well as the com'ses taken by the lava streams emitted during the eruption of 1631
and the succeeding eruptions of the last and present centuries. The portion of the
surface of the mountain covered by the lava of the late eruption np to the time of
the author's asceut, was also indicated on tliis map. The author then pointed out that
the mountain previous to the tirst of the historical eruptions, that of a. p. 79, was
a simple widely-spreading cone having a single great crater, and that it then had
every appearance of being an extinct volcano. Besides overwhelming Herculaneum,
Pompeii, and Stabia;, the eruption of 79 left another great memorial of its occur-
rence in the destruction of half of the enclosing wall of the great and ancient cra-
ter, and in the formation of that which has gradually grown, by the accumulation

of the ejectamenta of successive eruptions, to be the present great cone of Vesuvius.

It was thus that this memorable catastrophe changed Vesuvius from a simple trun-
cated cone to the double-peaked and picturesque mountain of modern times, to a por-
tion of which the Italians give the name of Monte Sunitna, and to the remainder
Vesuvio. This part of the paper was illu.strated by a series of diagi-ams showing
the changes which have successively taken place in the form of the volcano.

   The succeeding portion of the paper described the author's ascent to the crater
during the eruption of 1868, and gave particulars of the phenomena displayed by
the volcano and observed during the month of March in that year. The inclina-
tion of the sides of the gxeat cone was found to be 40°, and the lava was ilowing
in many small streams near the Hermitage at the rate of 300 yards per hour.

The Gold-JieJd of South Africa. By Dr. Manx, Superintendent of Education

                    and Specicd Commissioner of the Natal Government.

   In this paper Dr. Mann described Carl Mauch's discovery of old workings for
fold on the high ground between the Limpopo and Zambesi rivers. Herr Mauch

  as been for some time bent on making his way through the African continent
from south to north. He started from Natal some four years since, and in 1804 was

in the Transvaal territory. In that year he accompanied an old, well-known ele-
phant hunter, Mr. Hartley, on one of his expeditions beyond the Limpopo. The
trip led them from the neighbourhood of Pretoria across the Limpopo, and along its

west side, until the river entered upon its eastward bend, when the himter climbed
a high granitic table-land forming the water-shed between the Limpopo and

Zambesi rivers in Mosilikatze's territory, about the 28tli meridian of longitude. In
this region, on the 27th day of July, Mr. Hartley directed his companion's attention
to some curious holes that he had stumbled upon, obviously made artificially in

masses of quartz rock. HeiT Mauch found in the situation indicated a vein of
 quartz rock about 4 feet thick, penetrated in one place by a pit 10 feet in diameter,
 and containing at the bottom ti-agments of quartz, slag, coal, ashes, and broken
 blast-pipes made of clay. On commencing his search he lit upon a considerable
                                                                                  :

138 REPORT--1868.

number of other pits scattered about in various directions, and from these pits he

collected bright lead-ore containing silver, and fragments of quartz rock impregnated

with gold. The pits were spread over a tract of land about two miles long and a

mile and a quarter broad. The exploration was subsequently carried in a north-

east direction to within 40 German miles of the Portuguese settlement of Tete, on

Athe Zambesi ; and other tracts unquestionably gold-bearing were noted.  limited

number only of gold-bearing specimens of rock were taken away, in consequence of

the jealous watching of natives appointed for the purpose by the chief; but pre-

cious metal of the value of 200 dollars was extracted from one of the fragments.

The distance from the Megaliesberg, in the Transvaal, to Mosilikatze's chief place

was found to be 224 hours of actual travelling by ox-wagon. Gold was observed

through a territory stretching around this centre for about 200 miles in a direction

from south to north. Tlie southernmost part of the gold district lies on the Um-

kosi river and in a mountain-range to the east of jMosilikatze's Kraal, and also at

Kumalo, near the 19th parallel of south latitude. The water-drainage of this part

of the country is southwards into the Limpopo. The nortlieru part of the district

lies upon the rivers Sechwechene, Sepakwe, Umzwerve and Umfule, all tributaries

of the Zambesi, and flowing to the north. The southern portion of the auriferous

tract is upon about the same meridian of longitude as the mouth of the Kei river,

the northern portion on the same meridian as the capital of the colony of Natal.

Carl Mauch entertains no doubt whatever that there is a very large and rich tract

of gold-bearing land in this high table. It is well known that gold is worked for

Portuguese goldsmiths at Tete, and that it has been exported for a long period of

time from Sofala, possibly the source whence it was sent to Ophir, in tlie Persian

gulf, in the days of Solomon. It appears almost certain that Carl Mauch has stum-

bled upon the great source whence the gold of Tete, and of tlie ships of Tarsliish,

has been primarily derived, and that there were rude workings, most probably by

natives, for procuring the precious metal on this very spot in past times. In one

place there was a vein of quartz that had been worked out to a depth of six feet,

and that had then been tilled in with earth, in which trees seven inches in diameter

were now growing.

Very considerable attention has naturally been drawn to the discoveiy of

Herr Mauch, who had gone down himself into Natal to communicate his observa-

tions in detail to the colonial authorities. 'S^arious prospecting and exploring parties

were in the course of formation, and there is no doubt that under the powerful

influence of the proverbial " sacra fames " the exact character and value of this

interesting district will shortly be ascertained.

On the PJii/sical Geor/rapJty of the Portion of Ahi/ssinia traversed hi/ the
            English Exjyeditionarii Force. Bij Clehents 11. Markham.

   The region traversed by our military expedition consists of a series of mountains
and plateaux, extending north and south upwards of 300 miles, and forming the
water-shed between the Nile and the lied Sea. It is divided, with reference to

--the streams which form the sources of Egypt's fertility, into three distinct regions
   1. The region drained by the INIareb ; 2, that th-ained by the Atbara ; and 3,
that by the Abia, or Blue Nile. From the eastern flanks of these moimtains only
small torrents flow down, which are dried up by the scorching heat as they
approach the Red Sea ; while on the western side the rivers have long courses
through deep vallej^s. But the Abj'ssinian highlands, though from their elevation
of 7000 to 10,000 feet above the sea they enjoy a delightful climate, are not so
favourably situated with regard to moisture as several other temperate regions
within the tropics. But a small sprinkling of rain falls on the eastern coasts,
opposite the arid wastes of Arabia, dmiug the winter and spring months, when
easterly winds prevail. Abyssinia has to look to the equator for most of her
moisture, when the sun marches to the north, after having pumped up the neces-
sary water from the Indian Ocean. Then, from June to September, she gets her
rainy season ; for her mountains are liigh enough to reach and condense the mois-
tnre that is hurrying northwards, and to bring it down to deluge and fertilize the
plateaux and valleys. As the clouds progress northwards much of their moisture
                                                                                 ;

has already beeu discliarged, aud the northern part of the country, which is

drained by the Mared, is consequently much drier than the more southerly pro-

vinces. The first part traversed by the British troops comprised the southern

portion of the province of Alnda-guzay and that of Againe. It consists of plateaux

at an elevation of 8000 feet above the sea ; of mountain masses and ridges rising

to a height of from 9000 to 11,000 feet ; of wide valleys surrounded by the plateaux,

at a height of 7000 feet, and of deep ravines and river-beds elevated from 4500 to

6000 feet above the sea. The plateaux are composed of sandstone overlj-ing a forma-

tion of schistose rock, 4000 feet thick, which rests on gneiss. Grand peaks rise

from the plateaux, frequently with flat tops and scarped sides. The valleys, sur-

rounded by the steep, scarped sides of the plateaux, are tolerably well watered

and yield good crops of grass aud corn. One of these valleys is seen from the

road leading from Senafe to Adigerat, and well illustrates some of the most strik-

ing featm-es of Abyssinian scenery. Just as peaks rise from the smface of the

plateau, so hills rise up out of the valley itself, from sides exactly like those

descending from the plateau, and with Hat-topped summits corresponding exactly

with the plateau le^el. One of these valhij hills is the Amba of Debra Damo,

famous in Abyssinian history. The general effect of such scenery is most striking.

It gives the idea of a dead level plain, which had been cut uito by floods, forming

ravines and valleys, but leaving portions of the plateau in their midst as islands,

just as navwies leave earth-pillars to measure the depth of their excavations. The

third great physical feature is the deep ravines and river-beds, which carry off the

drainage, on the one hand to the Mareb, and on the other to the coast. The

deepest of these gorges are towards the Red Sea, and form the magnificent scenery

of the passes. On leaving Adigerat the expedition entered upon the second phy-

sical region, drained by the affluents of the Atbara, and extending to the valley of

the Taccaze. The northern half, as far as Antalo, consists of sandstone and lime-

stone, the southern half wholly of volcanic rocks. The important mountain knot

of Haral ends abruptly towards the south at a point about eight miles south of

Adigerat, and divides the drainage of Mareb from that of the Atbara. Looking at

these mountains from the great plain of Haramat to the south, they appear like a

mighty wall rising suddenly from the plain, bold sandstone cliffs with flat tops,

surmounted here aud there by tiamcated cones, AA-ith higher peaks in the interior

of the mountain knot rising above them. At the southern end of the plain of Hara-

mat the character of the country changes ; there is a descent of upwards of 1500

Afeet, and the scenery passes from a temperate to a dry subtropical type.  broken

hilly country continues thence to the great stony plain of Antalo. The country

between i\jitalo and Magdala is a mountainous region entirely composed of vol-

canic rock, but it is divided into two very distinct parts by the river Taccaze. That

to the north is an elevated ridge, crossed by several lofty ranges of mountains

that to the south is a plateau of still greater height, cut by ravines of enormous

depth. The latter is drained by the principal affluents of the Blue Nile. South

of Antalo the scenery becomes grander, the vegetation more varied and more

abimdaut, and the supply of water more plentiful. The peculiar feature

of the whole region is that, while the backbone of the mountain system runs

north and south, it is crossed by ranges of great elevation running across it in

the direction of the drainage and dividing it into sections. The mountainous

country between Makhan and the basin of Lake Ashangi is about fourteen miles

across. It is well wooded, the hill-sides being covered v/ith junipers as tall as

Scotch firs, flowering St. John's-worts growing as trees, and a heath with a white

flower. The view from the southern edge of this highland is magnificent. Far

below lies the bright blue lake of Ashangi, bordered by a richly-cultivated plain

and surrounded by mountains on every side. The lake is without an outlet,

although lying on the edge of a vast extent of country at a much lower elevation.

It is some 4 miles long hy 3 broad, and lies 8200 feet above the sea-level. As the

water is fresh, the outlet is probably obtained by percolation at some point on the

eastern side. The part of the Lasta province south of the lake is broken up into a

succession of mountain spurs and deep ravines, fertile and well watered. South of

Athe Taccaze the nature of the country again entirely changes.  mighty wall

rises up, 2600 feet high, and ends in a level summit, forming the edge of the
140 KEPOKX--1868.

Wadela plateau. With tlie exception of clumps of kosso and juniper round the
churches, Wadela plain is without either trees or shrubs. The scenery is wild and
desolate, not unlike that of the interior of the Orkney Islands. The Jidda river
separates the Wadela from the Dalanta plateaux. The height, where the river

separates them, is about 9200 feet, and it seems evident that they formed
once a single mass of columnar basalt, through which the Jidda, in the course of

ages, has gradually worn its way down to a depth of 3500 feet, carrying countless
millions of tons of earth away to fertilize the plains of the Lower Nile. The flora

on the Dalanta plateau is very English, consisting of dog-roses, the nettle, yellow and
pm'ple Compositae, clover, and plantain. The ravine of the Bechilo, on its southern
edge, is even deeper than that of the Jidda, being only 5640 feet above the sea.
To the south of the Bechilo rises the Magdala system, or knot, of mountains.
Magdala itself is a mass of columnar basalt, with scarped perpendicular sides, and
with a plateau on the top, about two miles long by half a mile wide. It it 9050
feet above the sea-level. Besides Magdala, the system is composed of the peak of
Selassie and the plateau of Fala, the three being connected by saddles at lower
elevations. They are not in a line, but form an angle, of which Selassie is the
apex and Magdala and Fala the two legs. The Magdala district is simply a portion
of the great basaltic mass of Dalanta, which has been cut up and furrowed by the

action of water during many ages, leaving the hills as isolated bits of the original

plateau.

                  On the North-East Turkish Frontier and its Tribes.
                                By W. GiFFOED Palgeave.

   The region treated of by the author was the mountainous district bordering

--Russian Georgia, and lying parallel to the range of the Caucasus a journey

through which he performed in the summer of 1867. The country is diversified by

fertile valleys, admirably adapted for himian habitation and increase. An unex-

--pected sight met his view in these remote places a teeming population, which

had been gathered together during the last few years, and which presented signs

of the formation of a new nationality. The difficulty of access to the valleys,
owing to the nature of the mountain passes by which they are reached, gives them

the advantages of natural fortifications, and they are well provided with all the
inhabitants could require, either for successful defence or to gather forces and to
issue forth against an enemy. Fifty years ago this part of the world was thinly
peopled, hardl}' exceeding the proportion of ten or fifteen inhabitants to the

square mile ; at the present moment it is teeming with life, consisting of emi-
grant Turcoman tribes, Kurds, Georgians and Circassians ; some having crossed

the frontier to escape from the overwhelming tyranny of Russia, and others
driven from their homes by the resvdts of Persian anarchy. The author's journey
commenced at Kars, accompanied by the Pacha and a numerous cavalcade of

chieftains and their followers, who wished to manifest by this display their

respect for a British official ; the author's course, in a straight liue, was about
140 miles, but the ground travelled over was nearly double that distance, as he
diverged to the right and the left to visit the various places. The scenery
throughout was most maguificent and beautiful, far surpassing anything seen in
Switzerland. All the chieftains and governors in the region belong to one ruling
family, which, by intermarriage with fresh arri\als, and forming an advantageous
admixture of races, has continually produced men of good sense and great power

in action. The intellectual and phj^sical superiority which the men of this family

display was, doubtless, due to their Georgian mothers, the chiefs having mostly

married women of this race, who are still distinguished for their beauty. From
every height the author crossed, new vistas were opened out of valleys dotted with
flourishing villages full of new white houses, surrounded generally with a ring of
gardens and a much wider circle of outer cultivation. One Pasha told the author
that in his father's time there were fifteen villages they now numbered eighty-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

three, some with twenty, some with sixty, and some with two hundred houses.

He also explained whence the population came. The Turcomans, whose country

has been conquered by the Russians, are discontented with the Russian Govern-
                                                                TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                     141

ment, and are continually on the look-out for opportunities to settle elsewhere.

Agents were employed to let these people know that if they would come and settle

within the Turkish territory they would receive grants of land and assistance to

build their houses, with the enjoyment of full civil and religious liberty. The
consequence was, that every year an average of about 5000 individuals of this
character cross the frontier. The Russians are also driving out the warlike Cir-
cassians, who, imder Schamyl, so long resisted their forces, and along with them a
large number of entirely peaceful Circassians, by the vexatious and arbitrary arrange-
ments to which they are exposed. These people all seek a refuge in Turkey, and are
located in the Mount Ararat district. Besides these the lands are further colonized
by Kurdish tribes, driven out of their own country by the anarchial state of Persia.
These people, who are herdsmen, and prefer a pastoral life, find a new home in
these rich pastures. All these men of diiferent races are not only nobles and

--peasants, they are soldiers, all animated by a common spirit in favour of an

Asiatic nationality a spirit which has been aroused by the sense of a common
danger, and which supplies a common bond of imion. The ruling family of the
incipient nationality was generally known as that of the Trebizondes, from the cir-
cumstance that its founder was appointed Governor of Trebizond in the time of Mo-
hammed the Second. Speculating upon the prospects of this new people, the

author said they might remain united with the Ottoman Empire, and become an
effectual barrier to the further encroachments of Russia, or they might form an

independent nationality, and, as our allies and friends, help to develope the great
means of communication between Europe and India by the valley of the Euphrates
and Tigris, of which they hold the key.

              Description of Hong Kong. By Granville Sharp.

              On tlie Uigurs. Bii Prof. A. V.\mb£ey.

The Uigurs are the most ancient of the Turkish tribes, and formerly Inhabited a

part of Chinese Tartary, which is now occupied by a mixed population of Turks,

Mongols, and Kalmucks. They were the first who reduced the Turkish language

to writing, borrowing the characters from the Nestorian Christians, who came to

their country as early as the fourth century of our era. The manuscripts of this

language, written in the characters mentioned, afford, therefore, the most ancient

--and valuable data in investigating the history of Central Asia nay of the whole

Turkish race. But these monuments are of great scarcity ; the author believed he
had collected all that had been discovered of the Uigur language. It was an inte-

resting fact that the Uigurs had a literature, and were very fond of books, at a

time when our western world was involved in ignorance and barbarism. The

most valuable manuscript the author had obtained bore the date of 1069, and was

written  in  Kashgar                                            it treats of ethics  and political subjects, and  forms a kind of

manual of ad\'ice to kings how to govern with justice and success. It reveals to

us the social condition of this interesting people, and forms, so to say, the basis of

the later regulations by which all Turks are governed. The author, ha^dng com-

pleted last year his ' Philological Researches in the Turkish of Central Asia,'

was now about to publish a treatise on ' Uigur Linguistic Monuments,' which

would contain more of the remains of Uigur literature than had hitherto been made

known. He intended also to show that the Tartars of ancient times were not

such barbarians as they now are, and that their civilization was earlier than that

of the West,

     Overland Route through British North Arnerlci. Bij A. WADDixaioiT,

   The author had devoted seA'eral years in British Columbia to the exploration by
himself and his agents of the various routes through the Cascade and Rocky
Mountain ranges, with a view to discovering the best line for an overland route
extending from Canada to the coast of the Pacific. The author believed that he

had satisfactorily solved this question, and that a practicable line, even for a rail-

road, had been found to exist from the plains of the Saskatchewan throng'h Yellow

Head Pass and across the central plain of British Columbia to Bute Inlet. The

latter, wliich penetrates the coast about 100 miles to the north-west of the Frazer

River, had moreover the ad\'antag-e of possessing- a fine and secure harbour, and of

being accessible to ·\essels all the 3-ear round. The author pressed the great prac-

tical importance of this subject, o^nng to the approaching- completion of the great

Pacific llailroad through the United States, which would lead to the transfer of

the China and Eastern trade from Europe to the New World, whilst at the same

time a shorter and a better route through British territory cotdd be shown to

exist. The result of the author's geographical investigations was to prove that

the physical diflicidties standing in the way of a railroad-undertaking through

British ground were not of great magnitude. It had, in the first place, been

hitherto g-enerally believed that the country north of Lake Superior was broken

and barren in the extreme, thus rendering it totally unfit to ser-\-e for an over-

land connnunication with the West ; so that the only feasible road to connect

Canada with the north-west territory and the Pacific must be through ISIin-

nesota. But tlie explorations which were made last year by the Canadian Go-

vernment showed that a vast tract of level country lies to the north of the hills

which surround Lake Superior, and that good crops of wheat are raised in this

region, in lat. 49". From Ottawa to the mouth of the Montreal river, 280 miles,

the country presents no serious obstacle. The ground hence to within a distance

of 280 miles of the River Nipigon, in long. 88° 25', was found to be " most favour-

able."  Further Avest there is a considerable amount of sterile country                                                                                                                                                                                                                                but beyond
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

the Lake of the Woods commences the great plain of the Saskatchewan, which

extends to the foot of the IJocky ^fountains, and presents one tliousand miles of

easy ground for the construction of a railway, besides possessing a fine climate and

a fertile soil. Unlike the arid American desert further south, through which the

Pacific Railroad of the United States has to pass, the British line would pass over

one of the richest countries in the world, and one of the best adapted for settle-

ment. The most practicable and suitable line for crossing the moimtains was the

northern route, by the Yellow Head Pass and over the Cailcoaten Plain, which

led to the road explored and ojjened by the author to the Pacific port at the head

of Bute Inlet. Thus the road throughout lay at a considerable distance from the

ITnited States boundarj'. The distance across the continent, from Montreal to

Bute Inlet, by this line was almost exactly 8000 miles, whilst the distance from

New York to San Francisco bj- the Pacific Railroad was 8230 miles. In winter,

when access to INIontreal by the St. Lawrence is prevented by the ice, the starting-

point would be Shippigan, which would reverse the difl'erence by 359 miles in

favour of New York. The whole country, from Ottawa to the Rocky Mountains,

along which the ]Droposed railway would run, is fertile, and fit for settlement,

except some portions of the interval of 285 miles between the Nipigon and Wini-

peg rivers, which are composed of Silurian rocks, and are comparatively sterile.

The difficulties in regard to climate are not so great as they have been supposed to

be. As a general rule, railway trains run regularly all winter, vrith the exception

of  an  occasional  snow-storm                                                           and  further  to  the  west  the  cjuantity                                                                                                                                                                   of  snow in
                                                                                      ;

winter diminishes with the decrease of atmospheric moisture. On the plain of the

Saskatchewan snow does not pack more than 14 inches thick, and evaporates

quickly. The isothermal lines, indeed, in crossing the North American continent,

curve northwards towards the Pacific coast, and .show an increase in mean tem-

pernture over the Atlantic coast equal to 11° of latitude. At Victoria, in Van-

couver's Island, snow rarely falls, and the Arhutus grows in the open air to the

size of a tree, the climate resembling that of Nantes in France, owing to the

direction of the trade-winds in the Northern Pacific. "S^ancouver's Island lies

nearer Eastern Asia, at least to sailing-vessels, than California ; for, according to

Capt. ]\Iaury, "the trade-winds place Vancouver's Island on the wayside of the

road from China and Japan to San Francisco so completely, that a vessel trading

under canvas to the latter place would take the same route as if she were bound

to Vancouver's Island ; so that all return cargoes would naturally come there, in

order to save two or three weeks, besides risk and expense." The author concluded

North American continent was through Britisli territory.

Explorations in Greenland. By Edwaed Whymper.

  On the Seychelles Islands. By Prof. E. Perceval Wright, M.D., F.L.S.

   The Seychelles group lie in the Indian Ocean, about 950 miles from Mauritius, and

about 340 from Madagascar, which may be considered the nearest land ; they are

thirty in number, and from their productions, which the author went out last year
to investigate, possess a gTcat deal of interest. The group was probably discovered

by Vasco de Gama as early as 1502. Capt. Picault in 1742 landed ou the largest
island and took possession of the group in the name of France. Their present
name was given subsequently in honom- of a French ofKcial, the Viscount Herault
de Seychelles. At the time of the French Revolution, and at different periods after
it, the French made use of the islands for transporting to them political offenders

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and thus members of the noblest and best families of France found themselves left
on their shores, with a grant of land and but little else to depend upon. In course of
time many of them were mariied to black slaves imported from Mozambique ; and

it may be said that French gentlemen with their black consorts laid the foundation
of the present population of these islands. Under the governorship of the Chevalier
de Quincey in 1794 the Seychelles were surrendered to the English Commodore
Newcome, imder threat of bombardment of the chief town. At present the islands

are in charge of a Civil Commissioner, dependent ou the government of Mauritius.

The largest of the group is Mahe, about 18 miles long and 7 miles broad ; the second
in size is Praslin, about two-thirds the area of Mahe. The chief town is Port Vic-
toria, situated ia a beautifid ba}-, land-locked, but with two entrances quite safe,
not only for the large steamers of the ^lessayeries Imperiales, but for some of the

largest ships of war which have as yet formed part of the slave-trade squadrons

in those seas. Although lying out of the reach of the hm-ricanes that devastate

the southern shores of India and Mauritius, the islands were once visited by a most

destructive typhoon. It rained for five consecutive days ; at the end of the fourth

day a great storm arose, and a landslip, 300 feet in width, rushed down the preci-
pitous sides of the principal mountam, carrying down everything on its surface,
blocks of granite fifty and sixty tous in weight rolled down in the vast avalanche,
destroying almost the whole ioYra. of Victoria. The town was restored imder the
superintendence of the present Commissioner, Mr. Swiubm-ne AVard, and has now a

very handsome appearance. The houses are nearly all built of coral and roofed vsdth
wood. At the last census the popidation of the whole group numbered about
7500. The temperatm-e during the cold season averages 83° F. (28°-3 C.) during the
day and 75° F. (23f° C.) at night. The climate is excellent, and the heat scarcely ever
disagreeable. The only serious disease is leprosy ; one of the smaller islands is, per-
haps, the only station imder the British Crown that has a leprosy es.ablishment.
This island, called Cun'eitse, is also the home and centre of one of the most re-
markable vegetable productions of the world, namelj', the lofty palm-tree which
produces the double cocoa-nut. The language spoken in Seychelles is French,
but very curiously corrupted among the lower classes of the population. There
would appear to be no grammar, no tenses to the verbs, and no declensions to the
pronoims. There is no phrase more common than " nioi ne cent pas," for I do
not kno2V. Many words are lengthened by the intercalation of vowels: thus,
" gelisser " for ylisser, " belouse " for blouse, &c. To trace the process of this
remarkable deterioration would be a curious philological study ; for we know that
the language was three generations ago spoken in perfect purity by the original
French settlers. The highest moimlain in Mahe rises to a heioht of from 3500 to
4000 feet. With the exception of a few porphyrilic veins, the islands may be said
 geologically to consist of nothing but the remains of a large chain of granitic moun-
 tains, which are clothed up to the summit with tropical vegetation. The coral

 reefs lie generally at some distance from the shore. It is evident that the land is

 gradually subsiding. Looking at the land from the sea, there are two well-marked
144 REPORT--18G8.

zones of vegetation encircling the slopes. The lower one consists of an enormous

assemblage of tropical plants, including dense groves of cocoa-nut palm, -which
form the wealth of the islanders, £20,000 worth of the oil having been exported in
1866. Manihot, rice, cinnamon, banana, the bread-fruit tree, aud pine-apple are

cultivated in the lower zone. The birds of the Seychelles have been recently
collected by Mr. Edward Newton, and found to offer several peculiar species.
Magnificent displays of phosphorescent light are observed at times by night in the
sea off the harbour of Victoria. Ou oue occasion, when the author was out in a
boat at night, two white clouds of light were seen comiug along the surface of the
water ; the boatmen were alarmed at the cxtraordinar}^ appearance, but on dashing
into the midst the clouds broke up into a number of large white sheets of light : t
phenomenon was caused by a species of mullet of gregarious habits ; countless
thousands were seen, each fish gleaming with phosphorescence on its scales.

ECONOMIC SCIENCE AND STATISTICS.

Address hy Samuel Brown, F.S.S., President of the Institute of Actuaries,

                                              President of the Section.

In the able and eloquent addresses which have been given in preceding years at

the opening of this Section, the nature .and objects of the divisions of science in

which we are more especially concerned have been so clearly pointed out, that I

do not propose to occupy your time with definitions and reflections, but rather to

take a hasty view of the principal questions which, since our last Meeting, have

come prominently before the public, and which are likely more especially to in-

terest the students of our science.

Whether under the head of Economic Science or Statistics, the range of subjects

is so wide, the interest so intense, and their importance to the public so vast, that

it is almost as dithcult to select, as it would be to confine within proper limits the

full history of the past year. Thought is so busy, and civilization (if we may use

the term generally to indicate an improvement in the social condition of nations)

advancing \vith such rapidity, that new subjects are continually thrusting them-

whomselves into notice and discussion by the different classes  thej' most affect.

It is essential, however, to make choice of a few leading features, and one topic

which has during the past j'ear, and is now exciting a very lively interest, is that

--Aof technical education.  very strong impulse has been given to the discussion
    Technical Education.

of this question by the various comparisons of the world's industry, which, ever

since the Great Exhibition of 1851, the success of which was so much owing to

the far-seeing intellect and earnest purpose of the lamented Prince Consort, have

enabled all nations to measure their respective progress in science aud art, by the

actual results of their manufactures and industries in every branch. Manj' persons

have expressed alarm lest other nations which have discovered their deficiencies, and

have set to work with energy and determination to remove them, should leave this

country behind in their applications of knowledge, by introducing and maintaining

a more practical, if not a higher standard of general education amongst the people.

Without going too far back to the frequent discussions to which this subject has

given rise, it will be sufficient to refer to the Report of the Committee appointed

by this Association to consider the best means for promoting scientific education

in schools, which was presented at the last Meeting at Nottingham. Tlie Com-

mittee admit the existence of a general and even national desire to facilitate the

acquisition of some scientific knowledge by boj's at our public and other schools
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

and a very interesting account is appended of the progress which has already
been made in Oxford, Cambridge, the University of London, and the College of

Preceptors, as compared with the French find German schools. The conclusions

of the report are highly practical, and recommend that in all schools natural

science should be taught ; that at least three hours a week should be devoted to
                         TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.              145

such scientific instruction ; that as to honours and prizes, it shoukl be placed on
an equal footing with mathematics and modern languages ; that universities and
colleges shoukl be invited to make it a subject of examination, and that the im-

portance of appointing lecturers, and oft'eriug entrance scholarships, exhibitions,

and fellowships, should be represented to the authorities of colleges.

  No mention is hero made of the extent to which, or the mode by which, the

Government might be called upon to aid in improving the technical education of

the countr3^ In the early part of this year, however, a conference, called by the
Society of Arts, brought together a great number of the most eminent statesmen,

men of science, teachers, and representatives of manufactures and commerce, by
whom this important subject was for two days discussed imder all its varied
aspects. It would be invidious to mention names, when nearly all the distinguished
thinkers who have so long worked for the educational improvement of the people

contributed their part to the discussion. The resolutions were general, giving

only tbe broad outlines of the opinion of the meeting, as it was intended to appoint

a subcommittee to carefully examine and report on the details.

The report of the Committee, which was not delivered in till the 21st of July

last, states that the conclusions they had arrived at were in substance, that tech-

nical education, as referred to them, excludes the manual instruction in art given

in the workshop, rather meaning general instruction in those sciences the prin-

ciples of which are applicable to the various employments of life. It should be

given, not in separate professional institutions, but in those for general education.
It is desirable that schools should be established, having for their main object the

teaching of science as a mental discipline. It is necessary to introduce scientific

teaching in all secondary schools. The higher scientific instruction should be
tested by juiblic examinations, and the proficiency of the students certified by

diplomas. In detailing the course of instruction for certain businesses, such as

agriculture and gardening, chemical manufactures, metallurgy, mining, civil engi-

neering, mercantile marine, that of the naval architect and marine engineer, the

mechanical engineer and machinist, the architect, and the merchant, the scientific

instrviction should be followed by practical pupilage in efficient workshops or

Aestablishments.  great advance in technical education might be expected, if the

employers of labour would generally give the preference to those who produce

evidence of having been adequately instructed in the sciences applicable to their

particular occupations.

These are practical suggestions, but the question itself opens up nearly all the

points or theories to which the discussion of the general education of a people has

given rise. Is it to be expected that ignorance would seek for instruction of its
own accord ? If scientific instruction is to be brought down to the lower class of

labourers, by what means shall the parent who prefers utilizing the manual labour
of his child at an early age, be compelled to spare him for the higher duty of in-
struction in order that he may be enabled to earn more for himself hereafter ?

It seems admitted that if better instruction is given in the secondary schools, it

must also be improved in the primary, as there is evidence to show that there is

little disposition in scholars to take to the higher class of learning without having

received the elements of it at least in the earlier stage. It is also proposed that

Howchildren shoidd remain longer at school.  will this affect the labour market,

and will the greater skill acquired compensate for the delay ?
   The attempts which have been hitberto made to bring lectures and labora-

tories within reach of the working classes, do not appear to have been very suc-

cessful, nor, as a general rule, do the employers of labour, who, we shovdd imagine,
would most benefit by the increased intelligence of their workmen in their special
art, give much encouragement to the efforts of those who have so patriotically

devoted themselves to this object. In Cornwall the Mining Institution failed in

its expected effects by the original defective education of the working classes, who,

unable to read easily, or to take notes, or to do the simple arithmetic required for
the calculation of the percentage of ores, soon grew tired of lectures they could not
follow with interest. Professor Huxley points out that the School of Mines in

Jermyn Street was not established by the mining interests, but by the eminent
geologist, Sir H, De la Beche, and that very few pupila attended until reeentlv,

wlieu, by tlie ofier of pecuniary rewards and niedals, and the prospect of appoint-
ments hereafter, 600 or 700 average papers were sent in for competition in some
branches of science, and 1200 or 1300 in chemistry. This seems to indicate the
right method by which the friends of technical education might stimulate the

classes to whom the higher rewards are not accessible. Associations might be

formed, so that in the \'arious branches of study the xmited subscriptions would

allow of studentships being given, tenable for three or four years. By these means
the young workman, or even one more ad^-ancod in life, may not only gain the

reward of his ability, but obtain some compensation for the diminished wages

which may temporarily follow the giving up a portion of his time to increase his
skill hereafter. The emploj'ers of labour of all kinds, but especially those in which
the higher ability required renders a considerable premium only a fair price for
admission to the business, might tempt many from the overcrowded professions

by a judicious offer of remitting the premiums where high distinction has been
gained. Probably the cost to themselves would be in many cases soon more than
compensated bj' tlie higher theoretical knowledge brought earlier into use.

    In connexion with this subject, it is impossible not to feel that the munificent

gift of Mr. "Whitworth deseiTes the heartfelt gratitude of the nation. What effects

will be produced by thirty scholarships of tlie annual value of £100 each, in a
single branch of applied science so important to this comitry as engineering, and
mechanical industry, it is difficult to calculate. Not merely the succession of new
aspirants every three years, but the numbers who, though falling a little short of
the splendid prize, will yet have given all their powers of mind to obtain it, may
be expected to create an impulse and maintain a mental activity which will not
allow England to fall behind in her continental rivalship. It is not to be expected

that many individuals can offer singly so noble and patriotic a gift, but they may

combine together, and thus, by tlie xmion of isolated efforts, institute similar
rewards for proficiency in other arts or occupations. That there is amongst our
industrial classes a large number of intelligent and skilled workmen, with ability

to compete for similar prizes, may he seen in the admirable volume of reports of

the artisans selected by the Society of Arts to visit the Paris Exhibition, and
published by the Society. I'he deep knowledge of their particular industry, the

general keenness of observation, the common sense, and in many cases talented
style of writing, besides the variety of the contents, make it a volume of remark-
able interest, highly creditable to the class from whom they were selected.

    In the higher branches of science, the rmiversities, colleges, and great schools,
with their wealthy endowments, will be called upon to move with the times
and there are signs of their already preparing to respond in a suitable manner to
the voice of the nation. The offer of fellowships, scholarships, and exhibitions

may be made to suit all grades of scientific requirements. Though it may sensibly
diminish the number of classical rewards, it is probable that it would not really

lower the high standard of classical excellence in the coimtry, whilst it would

raise up a fresh career in which renown maj' be vron. Many who by other in-
clinations may not be the first in classical studies, may achieve a world-wide

fame for the university or college of their choice, by their attainments in science

instead.

   In what manner the Government may best be able to second the efforts of the
friends of education is as yet undecided. Some suggest that they should establish

secondary or higher schools in the locality of a particular industry, and adapt the
teaching to the special wants of the population around. But the question arises,
are these schools to be founded in places where no special desire is felt for the
higher instruction offered, or in other places where the voluntary efforts, either of
the masters or worlanen, or both, only require additional aid to render them effec-

tive ? It may be said that the former need it most ; for how are we to overcome

ignorance or apathy, if the State will not be at the expense of exciting at least a
desire for improvement, and teaching the people the advantages and pleasures of

knowledge. On the other hand, are those who have proved their earnestness by
pecuniary sacrifices to be left to struggle on feebly, whilst others who are indifferent

to scientific education have it brought to their doors ? Others, again, consider
that schools for special science, at any rate for the labouring classes, have gene-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        H

                  TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                                                                         147

rally failed of success, and that the best plan is to improve education generally,

giving it a higher tone, both in the primary and secondary schools, and making

science more a part of the general study, but with special application of it for the

pupils of more ad^·anced ages.

The evidence in the Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons

on the subject, which has recently appeared, gives an encouraging view of the

practical skill of oiu- workmen in nearly all branches of industry, leaving no reason

to fear the ri'ialrv of foreigners in mere handicraft. But the competition in com-

merce and manufactiu-es is so close in the markets of the world, that the superior

technical education of the continental workman, enabling him to adopt so readily
any new processes or improvements, gives him manifest advantages over the

English workman. It is essential for our industrial classes to be better instructed

in science and its applications, and be less liable to fail by climisy inventions and

costly errors.

On the whole it would seem that the action of the Government will be most

beneficially exei-ted in the iirst instance by extending the system of grants in

aid of local exertions, by adding to the emoluments of teachers who produce

evidence of the higher class of instruction having been efficiently imparted, and by

aiding in the cost of buUding where new schools of a special scientific character

are needed. Above all, the stimulus of endowments or exhibitions of adequate

value, or the oiler of Government appointments in such departments as science can

be most usefully applied in, will probably produce the most profitable results for -a

national expenditure.

 --Labmtr and Capital. Another subject, vitally connected with maintaining the

position of this countrj' in its competition abroad, as well as with its peace and

prosperity at home, is the relation of wages to capital. For many j'ears the most

violent discussion has been going on                                                                                                                                         but it really appears as if some progress  has
                                                                                                                                                                          ;

been made diuing the past year in an amicable solution of the difficulty. The

opinion that labour and capital must be in antagonism, each trying to subdue the

--other to its own terms an opinion which can only be entertained in complete ig-
--norance of their relative functions is becoming gradiutlly imdermined, and the

earnest efibrts of some of the most practical and enlightened employers of labour,

aided by the increased intelligence and better feeling produced by conciliation on

the working classes, have allowed some important experiments to be fairly tried to

reconcile the two opposing foes, and to bring them mto harmonious working to-

gether. It is true the beginning is feeble, and what is accomplished small, com-

pared with what remains to be done. It is now generally admitted that a better

knowledge of the principles of political economy, and of the laws which regulate

wages and capital, the production and distribution of wealth, would be beneficial

Ato all parties.  most influential general committee has been formed imder the

auspices of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science. In an

evening meeting, at which the Eight Hon. W. E. Gladstone presided, the question

was debated, and certain general principles laid down for the course of proceeding.

But the vrork to be accomplished is of the most laborious character. The mass of

prejudice to be overcome on both sides is the growth of years, and it yet remains

to be seen how the interference of a third party, though professing to represent im-

partially the interests of the public and the true principles of economic science, will

be received by either. It is to be hoped, at any rate, that the clumsy and barba-

rous system of strikes and locks-out, which destroy both the small savings of the

workmen and the capital out of which he hopes to increase his wages, and which

keep ttp a perpetual somx-e of irritation and ill-feeling, "5%all be abolished as an in-

sensate and reckless process. Trades' Unions are contended for by some as useful

and effective, if not carried on to the injury of the trade, or to the detriment of the

nation, and provided the members pursue their own objects without undue coercion

The limitation of times of labour, the depression of the sober, industrious, and most

other countries or other trades, and thus leave the infatuated workman with worse
prospects of success than when he began the strike. Nor can we pass over the
selfishness with which one branch of occupation frequentlj' pursues this system of
strikes without reference to others, who, though unwilling to throw up their em-

ployments, are forced into unprofitable idleness, misery and want, that other classes

may better themselves by higher wages. The whole of this false and dangerous

system must be superseded by some other scheme or schemes which will unite in
harmonious working labour and capital. It is not necessary that there should be
but one remedy. The excesses of the working classes of France in the Revolution
of 1848, and their vote to expel the English workmen, led to the indignant remon-
strances of the French political economists, and eventually to the institution of the
 Conseil des Prud'hommes, courts of arbitration, and industrial partnerships, which
have had the happiest eflects. In France, in the ten years 1830-40, Mr. Mundella
 informs us the courts of arbitration have adjudicated on 135,730 cases, of which
 128,319 were amicably settled, 3530 withdrawn by consent, 3881 judgments
 pronounced, fi-om which there were only 155 appeals. In Nottingham especially,
 according to the testimony of Mr. Mundella, the working of the Board for seven
 years up°to the present time, has been most favourable, and in the highest degree
 satisfactoiy both to the employers and the employed. The Board consists of an
 equal number of masters and workmen on each side, with a president chosen by
 consent, and for three years and a half they have been enabled to agi-ee on all points
 in debate without the necessity of coming to a vote. The system has recently been
 extended to Hawick, North IBritain, and to the Potteries. The Coimcil of the
 Amalgamated Trades Unions passed a resolution, desiring the establishment of these
 Boards in all branches of their Union ; and there seems little doubt that the courteous

 and kindly meeting together to settle in common questions which were formerly

 sources of hostility and irritation, would, if introduced in all trades, have a won-
 derful effect in uniting two classes so essentially necessary to each other as the

 capitalist and the labourer.
     But there appears to be even a more powerful mode of cooperation, because it

  appeals more directly to the self-interest of the working classes, viz. industrial

 partnerships, in which the masters and workmen may unite together. Cooperative

  stores imply a combination of consumers to cheapen the price of articles pur-

  chased, but their tendency is naturally to dispense with the class of dealers or

  middlemen, and by the saving of the profits formerly gained by them, the consu-
  mers benefit at the cost only of the relatively small expenses of managing the stores.
  But what would become of the class of dealers or tradesmen, if this principle was
  generally acted upon ? In admitting the workmen into partnerships of production,

  the greater part of the difficulties between labour and production seem to vanish.

  As every one of the partners is interested in increasing the profits, he can have no
 wish to stint his own labour, or to check in any way the labour of others. He not

  only is careful not to waste the materials himself, but he keeps a vigilant eye that

 his fellow workmen may be equally careful. He is led to understand the accounts

  of a firm, and the causes of depression and prosperity of trade. Strikes frequently
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

  occurred when from the closeness of foreign competition the market could least
  bear them ; the workman, when a partner, sees that at such times his profits would

  be diminished by any check to, or increased price of labour.

     The most remarkable and encouraging example of the new system was given in

  a aper by Mr. Briggs, read before the Social Science Committee of Maj^ last on

  the Whitworth collieries. In ten years there had been four strikes, involving

  cessation of work for seventy-eight weeks. During the whole of that period the

  annoyance and anxiety of the partners were extreme. The profits were reduced
  to little more than 5 per cent, on tlieir invested capital. They were compelled to
  evict families fi'om their cottages, in order to introduce new labourers for their

  works. The police were required in large numbers for the protection of the non-

  union men. At last the painful struggle terminated in a riot in the village, the
  ringleaders of which were convicted at the York Assizes in 1863. But in 1864

  the proprietors determined to take the whole of the men into partnership, and

   a limited liability company was formed from 1st July, 1865, of which they re-

   tained two-thirds of the capital, the remainder being allotted in shares to be pur-

chased by tlie men. After paying a moderate rate for wages and management, and
the proper allowance for reserves and depreciation, any excess over 10 per cent, of
the profits was to be allotted half to the capital, and the other half as a bonus to
the workmen in proportion to their earnings. At first they were suspicious, but

mthe plan succeeded so well, that the very first year the dividend was 12 per cent.,

and the 2 per cent, which was allotted as a bonus on wages, allowed of an average

increase 7i per cent, to the work-people on their earnings. In the second year, 80 per

cent, of the workmen took shares ; the profits were 13 per cent., and the 3 per cent,
bonus allowed an average increase of 10 per cent, on the workmen's earnings, besides
setting by 9 per cent, on the capital as a reserve fund. The village Las been per-
fectly peaceful, the work-people have become sober, industrious, and respectable in

their conduct, and they generally invest their profits in the extension of the business.
There has been no dispute and no charge of neglect of work made. This is not a

small experiment, 1200 men and boys have benefited by the operation, and £90,000

of capital is invested in the concern.

   With modifications adapted to different trades, this system seems worthy of a
wide extension. The proper rate of bonus for labour must, no doubt, depend on the
proportion which the labour bears to the other costs of production and of bringing

the article to market. Competition of foreign countries, variations in supply and

demand, may prevent wages bearing a fixed proportion to the other capital required,
consequently the bonus to wages may have to be adjusted in diiferent manufactures
or trades. But some of the best of the trades' unions have declared themselves in

favour of the trial of this scheme, and the commercial greatness of England is deeply

--interested in its success.
   Insurance. Leaving subjects still so full of doubts and difficulties, we turn to

one which, though established upon laws of nature equally recondite, has been
pushed iuto practice with an energy and success higlily creditable to this country.
It would be inexcusable in this city (in which have been founded two amongst the
greatest and most enterprising of om* insurance companies, which under the able
management of Sir Samuel Bignold, one of the Vice-Presidents of this Section, have
obtained so wide a reputation, and to whose representative in London, Mr. C. J.

Bunyon, we are indebted for the best works which ha-\e appeared on the law of

fire and life assurance) not to allude to the progress which these valuable institu-

tions have made in this country. Vital statistics are now assuming a form which
enable the most complicated problems of human life to be dealt with as if they were

certain and simple events. Yet little more than a century has elapsed since the
Attorney- and Solicitor-General of that day, when reporting on the application for

a Roj^al Charter to the first society formed on scientific principles for the assurance
of life, objected to it on the ground that its success must depend on calculations
taken on tables of life and death, whereby the chance of mortality is attempted to
be reduced to a certain standard. " This is a mere speculation," they observe,
"never j^et tried in practice, and consequently subject, like all other experiments,
to various chances in the execution." Further, considering that the general tables
include both healthy and unhealthy lives, they thought that " the register of life
and death ought to be confined, if possible, for the sake of exactness, to such per-
sons only as are the objects of insurance." It was argued, to show the small pro-
bability of success for the society, that the Eoyal Exchange Assurance, in forty
years, had taken only £10,915 in premiums, of which the profits, amounting to only
£20-31, must have been nearly exhausted in the charges of management. They
would hardly expect a more considerable capital to arise from lower premiums, and
the hazard of loss will be increased in proportion as the dealing will be more ex-
tensive. The petition was dismissed, but the Society (the Equitable) was formed,
and in spite of the gloomy prognostications at its birth, had afterwards, at one time,
nearly £20,000,000 of assirrances on lives in force together. About six years back,

from an estimate made on a large proportion of the companies in the United King-
dom, it was computed that about £372,000,000 were assured upon lives ; and at the
rate of progress made of late years, it is probable that this is now increased to
£400,000,000. But a still more remarkable extension of this kind of business has,
within a few years, taken place within the United States of America. At the close

of 18G6, thirty-nine companies doing business in the State of New York, had about
--150 . REPORT 1868.

305,390 life policies in force for upwards of £173,000,000, whicli at the end of 18G7
Ahad increased to 403,841 policies for £233,400,000.
                                                      single company, the Mutual

of New York, had issued in that one year 19,400 policies for £12,450,000, takiug

in new premiums upwards of £801,000. The assurances in that Company alone

amounted to nearly £39,000,000, being almost three times the amount at present

existing in our largest office in this country.

   Considering the gi-eat pecimiary interests at stake, the discovery of the true law

of mortality is of deep importance. The theory of that eminent mathematician,
Benjamin CTompertz, F.R.S., that there is in the human frame a power to oppose

destruction, which loses equal proportions in equal times, and consequently that
the intensity of mortality is represented by a series in geometrical progression, was
founded upon actual observations of numerous tables. Sucli a theory is congruous

with many natural effects, as, for instance, the exhaustions of the receiver of an

air-pump by strokes repeated at equal intervals of time, and it has been confirmed
for long periods of life in most of the tables of original observations which have

been made. There is a marked difference, however, in the constants of mortality
in three principal periods of life, childhood, manhood, and old age. There are also
exceptional or climacteric years of life, and from the variety of circumstances which

may effect health or life, such as occupation, locality, habits, exposure to disease,
&c., so many peculiarities in each class of observations, which themselves may have

been incorrectly or imperfectly collected, that it is very difficult to detect in any

what may be called the true or universal law of mortality.

  A very important inquiry is now being made, under the auspices of the Institute

of Actuaries, into the actual experience of some of the older companies. The facts

relating to 147,000 persons admitted after medical examination as liealthy lives, of

whom about 24,000 had died, afi'ord ample materials for many interesting deductions

Ain vital statistics, and are especially valuable for the accuracy of the records. _

similar investigation is being made in Germany and in the United States of America,

conducted by scientific institutions of a like character, and by some of the leading

mathematicians of those coimtries.

   It is to be regretted that no authentic information as to the total amounts in-
sured in various branches is known in this countrj'. In fire insurance a rough es-

timate, dediiced from Ihe duty, would give about £1,445,000,000 in 18(37, inclu-

ding nearly £80,000,000 on farming stock. The total amount of marine insurance

business is' equally xmcertain, though it must be increasing with the rapid strides
of commercial enterprise. Mr. jMorris Blaclc, in his analysis of the accounts of marine
insurance companies established since 1859, gives the premiums received by eleven

of these companies in 1867 as nearly £2,800,000, insuring about £227,000,000 ; but
this does not include the five oldest and largest companies, nor the great amount

undei-written by the members of Lloyd's. The total value of shipping and com-

mercial products liable to risk in voj'ages between difierent ports would be the

more interesting, as the Statistical Committee of Lloyd's have for the last two
years, by the aid of their honorary secretary, Mr. Jeula, collected and compared some

"of the most striking results of the accidents and losses in which, as a great maritime

nation, we take so great a share. In 10,587 vessels in 18GG, to which accidents of soma

kind happened, and 11,424 vessels iu 1867, the accidents of different kinds, whether
sailing vessels or steamers (the latter being about 10 per cent, of the total), show

a remarkable regularity in the percentage, and indicate the value of a more exten-

ded inquiry. The taljles comprise losses and casualties in all parts of the world,

and are divided into thirty-one geographical sections, for the voyages between the

ports in each section. With these and the annual wreck registers of the Board of
Trade for the dangers nearer our own coasts, and fuller statistics from our own and

foreign countries, on a uniform plan, of the amount and value of shipping and car-

goes passing from port to port in difierent trades, we may expect a great increase in

our general knowledge on these subjects.

   At the Statistical Congresses held in Paris in 1855, and at Berlin in 1863, it was

recommended to collect tlie statistics of all branches of insurance, in such a form
that the progress of nations therein might be compared. The heads of the Govern-

ment Statistical Departments of several countries are now engaged in maturing a

plan for comprehendmg these and other c-ommercial statistics iu a full report.

 --Electric Telegraphs. One of the mobt important aids to the social and commer-

cial progress of any country, is the facility in the means of personal intercourse,
and especially of frequent commimications by post and verbal messages. Good
roads and railroads, giving rapid and cheap means of transport both for passengers
and goods, are essential to the increase of internal trade. But equally essential is
the power of sending swift and accurate messages, and receiving prompt and cor-
rect replies. The annual extension of the postal and telegraph system is a striking
proof of the mental activity and growth of the internal trade of the countiy. In
1867 the letters delivered had readied nearly 775,000,000 in the United Kingdom
(being 3^ per cent, excess on the previous year, and averaging 144 letters to each
inhabited house). The book packets were more than 102,000,000, being an in-
crease of one-half per cent, on the pre^dous year. The receptacles for letters were
17,225, being 1 to every 312 inhabited houses.

   Whoever originated the idea of the penny post, tlie nation will always feel that
it is to the ability, the energy, and the perseverance of Sir Rowland Hill that we
are indebted for the inestimable benefits which have followed the realization of
the idea. In the history of the progress of the age his name will be always

conspicuous.

   The success of the Post Office, and the enlightened readiness with which every
improvement is adopted and the wants of the public supplied, give us reason to
hope that what many regard as a very questionable interference with jirivate
enterprise, in the proposed purchase of the telegraph property of the whole king-
dom, in order to place it under one management, will prove eminentlj' for the
public benefit. The facilities possessed by the Post Office in having money-order

officers and employees who, at a very slight additional expense, may work the

telegraph in localities in which it would scarcely pay profits to the companies to
form new stations, are likely to create and satisfy the demand for numerous

extensions. In populous places, from which the profits are mostly now derived

(it is stated that 75 per cent, of the entire receipts are from fifteen towns, and
one-half from Loudon ), the combination of the pillar-post and stamped paper for

telegraphs in the suburbs, the saving of extra charge for distances in the delivery,

and all over the country a uniform and cheap rate, will no doubt lead to an im-
mense development of the system. It is highly probable that in a short time a
uniform charge of Gd. a message of a certain length will be established. The con-

sequence will be felt as v/ell in the convenience of private intercourse, as in the
internal trade of the country in bringing distant markets together, and, by increas-
ing the competition, obtaining a greater approach to equalization of prices for the

great benefit of the public. It is assumed that the number of telegraph messages
is increasing at the rate of 10 per cent, per annum, and that on the 1st July, 1869,
the Government wiU start with the estimated number of 7,500,000. Supposing
that present charges of £65,0C0 a-year may be saved by amalgamation of all the

lines, and allowing for various costs, for extension, Szc, a maximum net revenue of
£358,000, or minimum of £203,000 per annum is Mr. Scudamore's calculation,

with which Government credit would more than raise the capital of £6,000,000
required for the purchase. But it is scarcely possible that with so many interests,
stiU to be settled by arbitration before the monej^-bill can be brought in in the
next Parliament, that even this large sum will suffice to complete the purchase.
There is nothing to prevent the Government competing, if the public interest
required it, without lapng out so large a sum for the pm'chase of interests which
are not vested. But besides the natural feeling of the public against the unfairness
of destroying, and the risk of discouraging, private enterprises which have produced,

or are calculated to produce, such good results for the country, there is no doubt
that the machinery and arrangements already complete, and the facilities affijrded
by the railway leases, form a basis for immediate improvements which will so

much the earlier repay the outlay. The other objections, that Government may

use the lines for favouritism or for political purposes, that they would have the

command of all the secrets of private individuals, as well as those of their public
opponents, that they might harass the press by delays, or transmit news to one

journal to the exclusion of another, appear either to excite no alarm, or to have
been met, as in the last case, by a judicious compromise, and the formation of a
153 EEPOBT-- 1868.

company to collect news for themselves. On the whole, there seems reason to
hope that this great experiment may be tried in the course of next year, and that

no fresh agreement with the companies, which would be still more costly, will be

--rendered necessary by delay.
    Conference on Weights and Measures. During the past year there have been

several important Congi-esses in which the British Association has been either

interested or represented. The Metric Committee, which was reappointed in

1866, imited its efforts to those of the International Decimal Association, to obtain

a special exhibition of the weights, measures, and coins of all countries in the

Paris Universal E.xhibition. The Imperial Commission applied to all the Govern-

ments of Europe and America to send copies of their standards, and to appoint

delegates to take part in a conference to be called for a full discussion as to the

best means of obtaining a uniform system for all nations. The exhibition, which

appeared to excite great interest, was held in the pavilion, in the central garden.

It had the great advantage of showing, by contrast, tlie singular simplicity and

beauty of the metric system of weight? and measures as compared with all others.

The Conference, at which delegates oilicially appointed by the governments of all

the leading cotmtries attended, was presided over with great ability, tirst, by M.
Slathicu, Member of the Institute of France, and afterwards by His Imperial

Highness Prince  Napoleon                                                 and  after a full  discussion  on an  able  report prepared
                                                                       ;

by Dr. Jacobi, Member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences at St. Petersburgh,

--it was decided to recommend the imiversal and sole adoption of the metric svstem,
   not a single voice being given against it, nor a single word said in favour of any

other system. Strong resohitions were unanimously passed also at the International

Statistical Conn-ress, held at Florence in October last, recommending its universal

adoption, advising that Assoinations should be formed in all countries where it is

not j-et introduced, to prepare the way for it and make its advantages known, and

that it should be taught in goveramental schools, and used in all post offices,

custom houses, and public establishments.

In this country, where the Metric Weights and Measures Act, 1864, venders the

use of the system legal, the singular anomaly still exists that no provision is made

for stamping and verification by the standards, and consequently parties may be

liable Ijy one Act to the usual penalties for using such weight's and measures,

although by another contracts made by them therein are lawful. The Act indeed

is so defective, and the progress of the system so great, that another Act was intro-

duced in the session just closed, to make it compulsory, within some given period

to be fixed in committee. J\L-. Ewart, together with "Mr. I'azley, Mr. Baiues, Mr.

J. B. Smith, and Mr. Graves took charge of the Bill, and after an animated debate,
the second reading was cai-ried by the large majority of 217 to Go. It was set

down for committee on 1st July, but the state of public business prevented its

being proceeded with. It will be one of the questions of great, if not pressing, im-

portance for early consideration by the new Parliament.

The tirst report of the Standards Commission wliieh has just been presented, shows

the necessity of the establishment of the Standards' Department, which carried

out one of the recommendations of Mr. Ewart's Committee. Several indications

are given of progress in the decimal system. The metre also has been laid down

from the authentic metre in the possession of the Royal Society, and the kilogram

verified by Professor Miller, transferred from the Royal Observatory at Greenwich,
and steps have been taken to procure a complete series of the weights and capa-

city measures of the metric system. But as to the probable effect of its introduc-

tion into this country, the Commission have not j'et had time to examine the
numerous papers which have been collected, but admitting its importance, will
give it their early and best attention.

   In the meantime the confusion and intricacy of the weights and measures in our
vast dominions in India have led to the appointment of Commissions to introduce a
thorough reform. The metric system has been recommended by Colonel Strachey,

F.R.S., President of the Indian Committee, as the best system for entire and exclusive
adoption throughout India, aud this view has been supported by two Commissions.
Mr. Charles F. Cover, in a very able paper on uniform metrology for India, proves
that formerly not only was the decimal system universal in India, but that the

aucient measures of land, and the original basis of the present system of linear

--measures, was almost identically the same as the metre 39-3 inches (for 39-37079

inches).

   The only cause for delay in introducing- a uniform system in India, seems to be
the idea that the imperial -^veig-hts and measures will still retain their position in
England, and that their system must have some easy relationship -with -n^hat pre-
vails here. But the metric system is admitted to be the best, and if it should be
finally adopted hero, all that vast population would be exposed to the inconveni-

ences of a second change.

In the United States of America, the metric system is permissively legalized,

but more completely than iu England, by the introduction of the standards for

verification. The official delegates of America have declared that the United States
Kwould follow England iu making the use compulsory.
                                                                                               England took the lead,

India and all her colonies would unite with us. The system which is now

legal, in whole or in part, and either compulsory or permissive, amongst 275,000,000

of people, would then comprise upwards of 450,000,000 of people using the same

weights and measure, with decimal subdivisions and multiples in the simplest and

most perfect form either for calculations or commercial use.

One hundred years ago such an idea might indeed seem Utopian, as would also

now be the notion of finding acceptance for another imiversal unit. But when,

by peculiar circumstances, such rapid progress has been made towards uniformity,

it is practical wisdom to seize every opportunity to promote it. In science, in

commerce, in education, in international intercourse, in statistical inquiries, it is

difficult to picture the vast benefits that would result from the adoption of one

--and the same unit by aU civilized nations.

the way of a monetary lunt of accoimt, or even uniformity of metallic currency for

the leading commercial nations yet a great movement has been going on therein

during the past year. The Conference, in connexion with the Universal Exhibition

at Paris, over which Prince Napoleon presided, discussed and agreed to resolu-

tions that the different Governments should adopt a common base or unit in the

issue of their gold coins ; that it should be of the same fineness, nine-tenths ; and

that in each country there should be one piece at least equivalent to one of the

pieces in another country, so that there might be a point of contact in the cur-

rencies of all coimtries. The 5-franc piece in gold was finally adopted as the

basis, since the multiples thereof would very nearly accord with the monetary

units of several countries. M. Wolowski, the distinguished economist, defended

with great eloquence and energy the double standard of silver and gold, but he

Afound no seconder.                        single gold standard, and everywhere the decimal subdivi-

sion of the unit, were carried as the nearest means of obtaining some coin every-

where current, and values easily translated into those of foreign nations.

But the International Monetary Conference, which was called about the same

period in June of last year by the French Government, is likely to produce still

more definite results. All the leading Governments of Europe and America sent

official delegates to represent them. The basis taken by the Conference, subject to

such improvements as miglit be suggested, was the convention concluded the 2.3rd

December, 1865, between Switzerland, Belgium, France, and Italy, for a common

currency ; by Article 12 of which convention the right of accession was reserved

to any State which would accept the obligations and the monetary system of the

union, as far as regards the gold and silver coins. The delegates did not appear to

have any authority to bind their respective Governments, except that of Austria,

for whom Baron von Hock at the end of the Conference negotiated and signed a

preliminary treaty of adhesion to the Convention of 1865. In the early part of

1867 the Papal Government had joined the Convention, and in April of the same

year the currencj" of Greece was remodelled on the same system.

The French Government were anxious to obtain some definite answers to the

propositions of the Congress, in order to call a new Congress with more extended

powers                                     but no definite time  was  fixed for the  replies,  some voting for replies by

Mr. Rivers Wilson, of the Treasiuy, has been referred to a Royal Commission for
their opinion, whether Great Britain would be justified in making any changes in
her currency which would allow in any way of her joining the Monetary Conven-

tion. This report, with the evidence taheu, is anxiously expected.

It does not appear that a merely international currency of one or more coins

would compensate for the trouble and inconvenience of altering, even to a slight

degree (one grain is all that would be required), the quantity of pure gold in the

pound sterling. But a common unit of account would ofler manifold advantages.

An international imit of 10 francs, which would have many advantages over

5 francs as the smallest gold coin, subdivided decimally, would at once give, in all

commercial quotations, and in all statistical records, precisely the same figures.

All nations who accepted it would use the same language of value, and instead of

the 5, 15, and 25 francs, as suggested by the Congress, which would require con-

stant computations in the translations of diflerent languages, only 1, 10, or 100
would be used, in which values in every country would always be expressed in the

same figures.

   If pure theory were to be insisted on for all the nations adopting the metric
system of M'eights and measures, 10 grammes of pure gold, without alloy, slioidd

=be the unit of value 34-44: francs, or very nearly £1 7s. Gd. But tliis would

necessitate the coinage of all their gold and silver afresh, the gold alone being

estimated to be £'280,000,000 sterling in those States which have joined the Con-

vention, as well as £-jC)0,000,000 in other continental States which may join

it hereafter, and £60,000,000 in the United States. In Great Britain the gold

coinage, though uncertain in amount, is not sj-euerall}^ reckoned at more than

£100,000,000.

WeI       must  therefore  talie  a  practical view of the  proposition                                             and it would not

be to the credit of this countrj', with its great influence in commerce, and its pre-

tensions to a high place in social progress, to withdraw from conferences in which

other nations are taking so active a part, in questions so likely to promote the

   Statistical C'lmfp-ess. The other Congress in which this Section is particularly

interested, was the International Statistical Congress, which, foiu' years after its
previous meeting in Berlin, was invited by the Government of Italy to meet in
Florence in the early part of October last year. The statesmen, learned professors,

and social reformers of Italy formed a larger Ijody of natives, U2o, with 85 foreigners,
than even the Congress in London in 18(j0. The King had nominated his eldest
son. Prince Humbert of Savoy, as general President, and His Excellency the
Minister of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce (S. de Blasiis), took a most

active part in the proceedings. 1 he effect of these Congresses, of which six have

been held since 1853, is seen in the great improvement in the form of collecting

government statistics of all kinds. ' By imiformity of methods and principles, not
only may the relative progress of nations be compared, but the phenomena of poli-

tical and social economy examined under different conditions and varying aspects.

Thus the law of the production and distribution of wealth, of the growth or decay

of popidation, the causes of early or late marriages, the effects of emigration on the

country left or adopted, the best means of the prevention or suppression of crime,

the evil effects of great standing armies, interfering with the production, or caus-

ing wasteful consumption in a country, and numerous other questions of the

highest interest to society at large, may be traced on the broad map of a c intinent,

instead of the narrow limits of a single country.

   At each successive meeting, the able and earnest men who, as government offi-

cials, really have influence to carry out the resolutions agreed to, have discussed

nearly all the subjects on which national prosperity depends. The summaries of

the previous reports by Dr. Engel of Berlin, and Dr. Maestri of Florence, are full
of matter for reflection, laying down the principles on which every possible statis-

tical question ought to be studied.

  An attempt is now being made by some of the leading members, animated and
guided by M. Q,uctelet, who may be considered the founder of these Congresses,

to collect on a uniform plan the comparative statistics of all nations under the

principal heads. The first volume, on popidation, was presented by M. Quetelet
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  155

at the last Congi-ess, and is an admirable resume of hundreds of scattered official
volumes. It is to be followed by other compilations in different branches of statis-
tics, showing that these meetings have not ended in idle discussions, but will assist

the philosopher in his studies, as well as the practical man in his efforts to pro-

mote the social improvement of the people.

   On the suggestion of M. Quetelet, a Section will be formed in the next Con-

gress, especially to examine statistical subjects in their direct relation with the
theory of probabilities. The laws of the recurrence of events will thus be elimi-

nated, and many questions which are now obsciu'e ma_v, by due value being given

to the weight of observations, be reduced to correct or approximate theory.

   iSuch CongTesses and meetings like the present enable all those who are engaged
in a common pursuit, to benefit by the laoour and skill, b}' the depth of thought,
or wide experience of their fellow-workers in the same field. They bring the

kindly feelings of friendship to the aid of scientific investigations; thej allow no

man to feel that he can repose, as if he had done enough for society; for he finds
in the brief interval since we last met, what new questions have agitated the
world, and how he must bestir himself to keep pace with the intellectual progress
of the age ; they point the way to unexplored tracts of knowledge ; they utilize
the smallest contributions of thought whilst filling the mind with suggestions of

the extent and variety of the problems which still remain to be solved in the

social condition of man. The domain of statistics is so vast, that we should wel-
come any new labourers who will cultivate the new fields of research constantly

opening up. If not strictly a science, it is at least a method of investigation which
requires to be conducted in a scientific manner, and in an earnest spirit of search

for truth. Even undeniable facts may be so collected as to serve the cause of pre-

judice, to perpetuate error, or to conceal the laws which they sliould reveal. In

social science and political economy, statistics may be considered the collection of
experiments, by the results of which we observe the hidden workings of the laws
which regulate the social condition of man, and his progress in civilization. The

growth and decay of population, the freedom of capital, and the rights of labour,

the duty of voluntary or enforced education, the extent of Government inter-

ference in labour or manufactures, the competition of prices, tlie true principles of

commerce, the most effectual means of suppression or prevention of crime, the
theory of taxation and national Joans, and multitudes of similar questions are aU
governed by subtle laws affecting the free will of man, checked and kept in place
by similar action in others, of which we catch a glimpse sometimes by their

irregular action in enforced or abnormal conditions, and sometimes by our having
discovered and acted in harmony with the natural law which governs them. But
as society is perpetually changing, what we have discovered and thought to be
truth seems fi'equeutly inadequate to account for the new phenomena presented.
It is only by extending om- observations from the narrovv^ spliere of a single

country or a single class to all countries and all classes, by such a uniform collection

of statistics as is now being made by all the Governments of Europe, by noting

differences as well as analogies, and confessing and correcting errors, and compa-

ring the operations of the same causes under various conditions of interference, that

we shall throw light on the many imsolved problems of social and political eco-
nomy which modern civilization presents.

On some supposed Differences in the Minds of Men and Women with regard to
                   Educational Necessities. By Ltdia E. Becker.

  When subjects are debated respecting politics, literature, or science, as they

affect the interests of humanity, there is usually no reference to the feminine por-
tion of the race. In questions relating to the supply of food, or to sanitaiy
arrangements, there is no need to refer to women, because every one admits that

they are equally liable with men to suffer from hunger and disease, and that they

have an equal right to be guarded, as far as possible, fronr the effects of these evils.

Were the same principle of common wants recognized in other questions than

those affecting mere physical existence, there would be no occasion to remark on the
156 REPORT-- 1868.

absence of provision for women. But women are supposed to have equal needs

with men only as regards the conditions of physical life. Their moral and intel-

lectual necessities are imagined to be widely different. The conditions which men

iind most profitable for the development of their faculties, and the promotion of

the highest enjoyment of which a moral and intellectual being is capable, they

appear to regard as unsuitable or imnecessary for women. Among these conditions
-- Whenare 1, a liberal education ; 2, political representation.
                                                                                          measures are under

discussion for securing these advantages to the people at large, it invariably

appears that the absence of provision for women proceeds, not on the ground that

they are included as a matter of course, but from the absolute exclusion of one-

half of humanity, as persons who have no part nor lot in the need for a liberal

education, nor for political representation. This systematic and wilful neglect,

and the legislative sanction given to it, has produced its natural fruit in the pre-

valence of the belief that women are endowed with an inferior order of intellect,

that they are incapable of being taught to the same extent as men, and that they

are naturally unable to appreciate the enjoyment derived from the exercise of the

higher intellectual powers. It is a question of serious importance to determine

how far this belief is a sound and scientific one. Is there, in truth, such a distinc-

tion between the moral and mental constitution of the two sexes, that what is

found to be beneficial  to   the  one  must be  assumed to be prejudicial to the other
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

that what a man likes and desires, a woman dislikes and deprecates ; that the mind of

one is progressive, of the other non-progressive ; or, admitting that both are capa-

ble of development, that then natm-e is so diverse as to require totally difterent

methods of promoting this development ? Because, if there is no such difference in

fact, the feminine portion of the race, being debarred from opportunities enjoyed

by others of cultivating their mental and moral faculties, must suffer serious de-

privation and loss. The magnitude of the privation may be estimated by consi-

dering the difference it would make to the men of England if there were neither

public schools nor universities to stimulate their intellectual powers, no career or

profession open to them wherein they could, by the exercise of these powers,

achieve honourable distinction ; if in all public movements the position assigned

them was that of mere spectators, if their rights and duties as citizens consisted in

obedience to the will of others, and if their wishes and opinions were never taken

into account in estimating the verdict of the people on questions of national im-

portance. If men woidd feel the loss of these conditions of mental life to be an

incalculable deprivation, it necessarily follows that withholding them from the

feminine half of the people must cause equally grievous injury, unless it can be

proved that there is a specific and ineradicable distinction between the minds of

the two sexes, and that what is good for men is bad for women. Whether such a

distinction  exists  seemed  a    proper subject of  investigation by a scientific society
                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

therefore the following propositions were submitted to the judgment of the Sec-

--tion : 1. That the attribute of sex did not extend to mind; that there is no dis-

tinction between the intellects of men and women corresponding to, and dependent

on, the special organization of their bodies. 2. That any broad marks of distinc-

tion which may at the present time be observed to exist between the minds of

men and women collectively are fairly traceable to the influence of the difterent

circumstances imder which they pass their lives, and cannot be proved to inhere

in each class in virtue of sex. 3. That in .spite of the external circumstances which

tend to cause divergence in the tone of mind, habits of tliought, and opinions of

men and women, it is a matter of fact tliat these do not differ more among persons

of opposite  sexes than they do   among  persons of the  same                             that on  comparing
                                                                                       ;

individuals, or classes, of men witli women, the differenoe between their mental

characteristics will not be greater than may be found between two individuals or

classes compared with others of the same sex.

   Agriculture lias been favoured by emigratiou, but very little by machinery.
The restoration of cotton culture, which had made great progress, under the
encouragement of the Government, is checlied by the fall of prices. There is an
increase in the quantity and value of imports and exports. The increase in the
revenue has been regular, but notwithstanding this there has been an increase of
expenditure, and the embarrassments of the Government are notorious. The rail-
way system is producing only limited results, but the telegraph is producing a

great effect throughout the empire, has a great effect on the provisional market,
and stimulates enterprise to a remarkable degree. There is no ground to believe

that any of the elements of the population are becoming extinct. The progress of
schooling among all classes, and the development of political rights amono- the
former subject-population, all attest the greater vigour and energy now diffused
but the Government is still far in advance of its subjects, and real progress is

dependent on the progress of general practical instruction.

        The Past, Present, and Future of the Wage-paid Classes.

                          By F. S. CORKANCE, Ji.P.

   After a review of the total, or partial failure to correct or cure, by modern legis-
lation, the social evils of which we most complain, and bringing forward as in-

stances the laws of settlement, poor laws, present and past, prisons, free labour,

emigration, and even our sanitary laws and regulations, the author stated his

opinion that these unfortunate results had arisen both from an imperfect knowledge

of antecedent circumstances, and the ulterior consequences arising out of them.

Of the wage-paid class, even the records we possessed were defective and incor-
rect ; and if we wished to form some idea of their social state, no better index could

be found than a careful review of the enactments affecting their state. Beyond

this our knowledge was confined to some great cataclysms, such as the Black

Death in the 14tli century, and the Reformation in the reign of Henry VIII.

These enactments embraced laws of settlement and laws of wages and labour,

the rate of which it was constantly attempted to fix ; instances of this sort occm-red
under local jurisdiction, even up to the commencement of the present centmy.
Both Lord Kaimes and Andrew Fletcher testify to this.

   Under such circumstances and popular conditions we found ourselves brought up
to the great developments of the lyth centurj% when the repeal of most of these
laws took place. Some however .survived, like the Poor Law and Apprentice Acts,
to be denounced by great men like Sir Matthew Hale, Locke, and Mr. Pitt, who

foresaw some of the future evils they were calculated to produce. Their fuU de-

velopment was nevertheless delayed to a later date.

In the early part of this century a great change took place in the habits of the

labouring class ; and under the impulse given to production by the introduction of

steam power, they emigrated in vast numbers from the south. In Lancashire,

which in 1801 had 692,7.31 inhabitants, there were in 1831 1,33.3,800 in York-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

shire, East Riding, 1801, 563,953, 1831, 976,400. Cottage industries were given

up, and the mass of this population were swept into mills, and constituted a wage-

paid class ; 35,000 handloom weavers became a pauperized class. To meet this

change, what were our legislators about ? ^Ve had seen their activity at pre-

vious periods. This was met by neglect, and a whole generation grew up in

ignorance and vice. Yet we wondered at trades unions and strikes.

Up to this time the old Poor Laws were still in force, and though constantly

Atinkered up, the evils did not fail to increase.                    few distinguished men, besides

those already named, appeared as reformers of the abuse. After Bentham, came

Sidney  Smith                            and in 1834 some effective  legislation took place.  The followino-

it was 61, so that while one person in 28 died at Chelsea from phthisis, only one in

61 died from the same disease at Hampstead. With regard to pulmonary consump-

tion, the returns showed that the death-rate corresponded generally with the density

of the population ; that the general mortality of England and Wales was at the rate
of 24-47 per thousand ; that in the healthy and more thinly populated districts the

rate was only 17'o3 per thousand ; while in the large towns it was 2801. In the
agricidtural part of Surrey it was IS per 1000, in Westmoreland 18, in Sussex 19,

in Lincolnshire 19, and in Dorsetshire 19 ; while iu the metropolitan part of Surrey

it was 25, in London 24, Staflordshire 25, Lancashire 27, Yorkshire 23, West
Hiding 24, and North Riding 19. At Bromley in Kent, at East Hampstead, in

Berkshire, and Dulverton, in Somerset, the rate was only 16; at Tenbury, in Wor-

cester, lung's Norton, near Birmingham, Hampstead, Pershore, in Worcestershire,

Haltwhistle, Bedford, Long-town, and Bootle, the rate was from 14 to 17; at Belling-

ham, in Northumberland, it was only 14, and at Glendale and Rothbury it was 15.

In Wales, the least mortality was at Ivnighton, where it was 16 ; in England, the
lowest rate was at Bellingham. The total deaths in the ten years were 4,210,715, of

which 508,923 were from phthisis, the deaths of females exceeding those of males

--by 30,313. In the twelve districts of England and Wales, the proportion of cases to

population was: North West 31, Monmouthshire and Wales 32, London 34,

Eastern Coimties 37, Yorkshire 37, North Midland 39, South Eastern 39, South

Midland 40, South Western 41, West Midland 42, Northern Counties 42, so that
the West Midland and the Northern Counties were the most exempt, and in the North

Western Counties andWales the disease was the most prevalent. Among sailors,

the most fatal stations as regarded phthisis were the western coast of Africa and the

AMediterranean.  dry atmosphere, cold or hot, was most frequent in districts

where phthisis was comparatively rare. Among some of the causes of phthisis

were possibly included, atmosphere, soil, climate, amount of population, natm-e

of occupation, hereditary predisposition, food, and the communicability of the

disease. There was no doubt that one frequent exciting cause of phthisis wa? the

exposed state of our railway stations and steamboat piers, which people would

--they were in cold weather liable to a sudden chill a matter that should be brought

before the House of Commons as one materially affecting the public health.

The object of this paper was especially to show that a moist damp atmosphere,

which by many had hitherto been considered the best for those predisposed to

tubercular affections of the Imigs, was the worst that could be selected. Thus,

talcing the county of Norfolk, at Thetford, and iu the surrounding districts, where

stagnant water and fogs were prevalent, the mortality was 1 in 28; whilst at
King's Lynn, Downham, and St. Faith's and other places it was considerably less.

The results are obtained by dividing the amount of population by the number

of deaths from phthisis duritui the ten years named. Fractions are pm'posely avoided,

. because the data are necessarily imperfect, and because such a comparative method

for general purposes is better understood.

engaged with Mr. Seely in investigating, imoificially, tlie various Estimates,

Finance, and otlier accounts annually presented to Parliament, and more especially

those of the Admiralty.

  A description of existing Admiralty accomits and of certain changes made from

time to time, will be necessary for this purpose.

  In 1864 he commenced his investigations. He found the principal Admiralty

documents annually presented to Parliament were,

   1. The " Navy Estimates ; " giving the monies required to he voted by the House
of Commons for the whole Na-\-al Service for the forthcoming year.

   2. Finance Accounts, called ''The Savings and Deficiencies on the Grants, &c.,"

whicli at the end of the financial year are published to show how much more or

less than the amomits voted has been paid for the Na^-al Service.

   3. Accounts called "Navy Ships" Accounts which profess to give the expen-

diture on each ship building or repairing, and the total so expended during the

past financial year.

   4. Accounts called "Navy Dockvards and Steam Factories " Accounts, which

profess to give the expenditure in each of the 12-j Dockyard " Manufactories,"
the 2.5 " Factories," and for the various conversions of timber at the saw-pits and
saw-mills of each yard. These documents also profess to give the cost and the
rate-book price of the several descriptions of articles made or timber converted at
each of these manufactories, factories, saw-pits and saw-mills. The rate-book price

of articles professes to be the previous year's average cost of articles at the tvJwle

7 Home Dockyards.

   5. Navy Labour Charts, giving details of labour employed on each ship. [Not
now published.]

   He fouud it diflicult to ascertain correctly what items of expenditure the Admiralty
had or had not included in their given cost of ships built and repaired. He there-
fore wont carefully through the Navy Estimates and Sa^-ings and Deficiencies

Accounts from 18G0-G1 to 18G.3-64 (four years), and picked out, first, merely the
amounts voted and paid for wages and ship-building stores bought, thinking the
Admiralty must have at least included these. But he found that tlie amount he thus

obtained exceeded the Admiraltv given expenditure in ship-building and repairing

by about two millions (£1,870;000) [see Hansard, Mr. Seely, March 2, 6, 9, and

April 3, 1865, p. 705]. In other words, he ascertained that eitlier the Admiralty

stock of ship-building stores had increased £1,870,000, or that £1,870,003 for
wages and materials had been omitted from the Admiralty cost of ships built and

repaired, or that both causes had operated to bring about this apparent deficit. He

then picked out other items from the " Estimates " and " Savings and Deficiencies "

that he thought properly chargeable to ships built and repaired, such as wages of

foremen, salaries of clerks employed in connexion with shipbuilding, &c., pensions

to shipwrights and others, who in consequence of these respective pensions work

for about '2s. a day less tliau other ship-\\Tights, and found that these additional

items amoimted to £1,.".G3,111 [see Hansard, Mr. Seel}', March 6, 1865, pp. 1198-
Naw1199; also
               Ships, 'Frederick William,' No. 538, Aug. 13, 1867, p. 27]. Early in

Februury 1865^866 Hansard, Mr. Seely and Mr. Childers, March 2, 1865, pp. 1012-

1018], Mr. Seelj' gave notice that he should bring the subject before the House of

Commons, and at the same time he showed these calculations and results to

Lord Clarence Paget, the Secretary, and to Mr. Childers, the Civil Lord of the

Admiralty ; and on the 2nd of March, and again on the 6th, Mr. Seely made speeches

on the subject in the House of Commons. To the credit of Mr. Childers, he, as

Chairman of a Committee of Admiralty oflicials then sitting, at once issued instruc-

tions to include these omitted items in future Admiralty Accounts [see Navy Dock-

yard Accounts, No. 465, 4th July 186.5, p. 27]. Directly after, Mr. Fellows went to

the Admiralty at the request of Lord Clarence Paget, Mr. Childers, and Mr. Seely,

where he met Mr. Childers and others, and these calculations were examined and

fouud to be correct ; and the Admiralty Navy Ships' Accounts for 1864-05, pub-

lished in February 1866, No. 44, included for the first time these omitted items,

and were consequently far more correct than all preceding accounts ; and in the

Army Manufacturing Accounts for 1864-65, published 7th March 1866, No. 96, he

found for the first time there are additional Balance Sheets, called No. 2, of all

 tlie mauufactories made out in a similar iiiauuer, and iucludiug similar items to
 his sheet of 1864, shown Admiralty, in 1865 (for copy see Navy' Ships, ' Frederick
 WilUam,' Aug. 18(37, Xo. 538).

    The Admiralty in their accounts adopted some of the omitted items thus brought
 to light, and their forms of balance sheet and accounts were similar to those by
 which he had been enabled to discover these omitted items. The.se principles and
forms, though the best for his purpose, which was to ascertain the total amount
 omitted, and the average percentage to be added to ships in consequence, were,
however, not the best principles and forms to adopt for an ordinary Admiralty
balance sheet ; for the proper method in the latter case is to add the indirect and
omitted items in each Dockyard to that Dockyard's Ships, and not to bring them
altogether into one lump sum for all the yards and then distribute it at one imi-

form percentage to every ship built or repaired at any of the 7 Home or 15 Foreign

 Dockyards.

   Later in the session of 1865, at the suggestion of Mr. Seely and Lord Palmerston,

on the 16th of June [see Hansard, 16th June, pp. 390-399] he went again to the
iidmiralty, and early in 1860, on Lord Clarence Paget stating on the 1st of March,
1860, that "The Hon. Member for Lincoln (Mr. Seely) had asked whether his

secretary coidd be permitted to go to the Admiralty in order to correct certain mis-

apprehensions respecting the accounts of the Accountant General of the Navy.
The Hon. Gentleman had been of great service to the Admiralty, and he should be
extremely glad to go into the matter with him " [see Hansard, March 1, 1860,
Paget, p. 1866], he entered into an investigation of the manufacturing accounts
(as arranged between Lord Clarence Paget and Mr. Seely) in conjunction with
the Accountant General and other Admiralty officials.

   Early in 1867 a correspondence occurred between the Controller of the Navy

(Admiral Robinson), Mr. Seely, and Mr. Fellows, and an investigation into the true

cost of the ships 'Frederick William,' ' Brisk,' and ' Cadmus,' the Admiralty having
disputed INlr. Seely's figures. In order to get the true cost of the ' Frederick
William ' which was commenced in 1841, and not finished till 1865, Mr. Fellows had
to ascertain the percentage to be added to ships generally for the omitted items for

each year, from 1841 to 1805. He found that up to 1801 the only items the Admi-

ralty reckoned as having formed part of the cost of ships were the mere labour
and materials employed directly in and upon each individual ship ; none of the
labour or materials used about the ship-yard, and necessary to ship-building, were

included. From 1861 to 1804 he found the latter items had been included, and in

1804-05 for the first time were added the items he had discovered as having been

formerly omitted.

   For this purpose he made balance sheets or tables [see Return, Navy Ships,
' Frederick William,' &c., No. 538, 13th August 1807, pp. 14-18], giving for each

year, first, the total cost of ships built and repaired, reckoned for each year, as
the Admiralty reckoned, up to 1801. In another column he gave the amounts

for each year, consisting of similar items to those included in Admiralty accounts,
from 1801 to 1864 ; in a third column he gave for each year the additional amount
of the items, added to Admiralty accounts in 1804-65. So that he had thus for

every year, from 1841 to 1865,
      1st. The cost of ships, for each year, reckoned as the Admiralty reckoned, up

   to 1801. This he called Method No. 1.
      2ndlv. The cost for each year, reckoned as the Admiralty reckon their accounts,

   from 1801 to 1804, or Method No. 2.
      3rdly. The cost for each year, reckoned as the Admiralty reckoned, in 1864-66,

   or Method No. 3.

He thus obtained the average percentage to be added to the Admiralty given cost

for each year, to get the cost as reckoned by the Admiralty in 1864-65.
   The Admiralty', in their accounts for 1805-06, published 22ud July 1807, No. 454,

changed for the second time the form of their accoiuits, and gave the three columns
as he had given them in the balance sheets, which were intended merely to enable
him to ascertaia the approximate percentages to be added for each year to tlia

Admiralty given expenditure in each year of the 'Frederick William,' 'Brislc,' and
* Cadmus,'

--163 REPORT 1868.

   Here, again, though these divisions were imperative for his pui-pose, it does not
by any means follow that they were the best for an ordinaiy account.

   He had already completed with Mr. Seely a special system of accounts for the

H7 ome and 15 Foreign Dockyards and their 150 different manufactories ; and

with the \iew of getting it introduced, Mr. Seely early in 1867 obtained a Com-
mittee of the House of Commons to inquire into Admiralty monies and accoiints,

and finding on inquiry ii'om the Accountant General that an Official Committee
(which had been appointed directly Mr. Seely gave notice that he should move for
a Committee of the House) had no forms or schemes to propose, and could come to
no aoi-eement or conclusion amongst themselves, Mv. Fellows gave and explained the
new^scheme of accounts to Mr. Beeby (the Accountant General), Mr. Walker, and
Mr. Brady, of the Admii-alty, before Easter. Mr. Seely s Committee finally recom-
mended the adoption of this scheme in its entirety, with certain minor modifi-
cations that had been jointly agi-eed upon between the Admiralty officials and
Mr. Fellows at their interviews before Easter [see Report, Admiralty Monies and
Accounts, 27th July 1868, No. 469, p. iv, par. 10; p. v, par. 13 ; pp. xv,xvi, pp. 306
to 322 p. 362. Q. 5761 ; and on p. 370. Q. 5899 ; and Appendix, pp. 698 to 603].

                                 ;

This scheme is now being introduced into the Admiralty. It reverses the previous
system of Admiraltv accounts. The practice had been to treat the whole 22 Dock-

yards with their l50 manufactories, as one gi-eat establishment, so that articles

made for ship-building or timber or materials converted, say, at Devonport, costing

on an average 20 per cent, heloic the average of the other yards, were yet charged
to Devonport's ships at the average cost of all yards ; and articles Sec. costing, say,
at Portsmouth, 20 per cent, more, were similarly charged; so that, though there
 might be a diflerence of 40 per cent, between the cost of articles &c. at Devonport
 and Portsmouth, yet these articles &c. were charged at the same prices to ships

 built at both places.

    Respecting the 150 manufactories and the saw-nulls and saw-pits in which are

 made or converted the articles or materials used in the construction or y( ; air of
 ships at each yard, he found that the so-called cost of timber converted or articles made
 excluded many items forming part of their real cost ; as, for instance, the timber as
 charo'ed to ships did not include the cost of freight, measuring, receiving into and

 issuing from store, the expenses or labour in taking it to or iTom the saw-mills or
 saw-pits, or to the ships where used (these items in 1805-66 being about £200,000) ;

 nor the wages of converters of timber, measurers, foremen, and clerks connected
 witli the timber conversions, though he found that in one yard he examined the
 omitted salaries amounted to a larger aimual sum than all the wages paid for the

 sawing and conversion of the timber itself, this latter being tlie only item for labour

 of any kind charged to the timber when converted ; in fact it only included part

 of the cost of labom-, and really only part of the cost of material, since freight &c.
 really adds to such cost. The same remarks will also apply to aU the manufactories
 and factories ; the only items reckoned and included in the cost of their articles
 being part, and part onh', of the cost of labour and material, all charges for fore-

 mens' wages and supervision and indirect expenditure being omitted altogether

 from such cost.

    The new Scheme reversed all this, and was based on the principle that each

 manufactory should be treated as if it were the only manufactory carried on by the
 Admiralty ; that all items of expenditure connected with it, direct or indirect, should
 be charo-ed to its products, and the thus properly enhanced price shoidd be the
 price at which the articles should be issued and charged to ships ; that all indirect
 charo-es in each dockyard that could not be appropriated and charged to the pro-

 ducts of any manufactory in any yard should finally be distributed on the ships
 built and repaired in the yard where such expenses were incun-ed. Lastly, it esta-

 blished a connexion between the Navy Estimates [which give the luoney to be voted]
 with all the succeeding accounts, by which the money as voted by the House could
 be readily traced and checked in all of them. This introduced a new principle into
 both what may be called the parliamentary accounts and the departmental accounts
  or detailed accounts of expenditure, such as cost of ships, articles made at the manu-
 factories, &c. By it a imity was created which did not exist before between the

  parliamentary and the departmental accoimts. This Mr. Fellows considered one of
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

the best and most novel parts of the scheme. The particular i-esult, so far as
the Admiralty is concerned, is that in future when the House votes money it will

practically ensure its proper appropriation, and the given cost of ships built and re-

paired must balance in each yard certain sums of money, as voted or arranged and

tabulated in the  estimates when voted by the House                                                                                                                                          therefore in future it will be
                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

impossible for the Admiralty to add or omit items at pleasure from their given

cost of ships. The importance of this will be at once seen when we consider that

a ship costing- £100,000, reckoned as the Admiraltv reckoned up to 1861, would be

given as costing- £-120,000, reckoned as the Admiralty reckoned from 1861 to 1864,

and from £140,000 to £1()0,000 reckoned as in 1864-65 and 1865-66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        or, in  other
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

words, of the £11,000,000 voted for the whole naval service, it was in the power

of the Admiralty to make out their accounts of the cost of ships so that it might

appear that tliey had spout £2,000,000 only for ship-building, when £.3,000,000

had been actually expended, or vice versa.

Finally, the great practical result that is to be expected from this reversing of the

previous system is, tliat a competition in efficiency and cost will be established
between manufactory and manufactory, between yard and yard, which was wanting-

before, and thatin future Devonport's or any otheryard's economyshall not be hidden
and taxed to hide and to pay for Portsmouth's or any other yard's extravagance.

0)1 Educational Endoiuments. Bi/ J. G. Fitch, one of the Assistant Cotmnii-

                          sioners of the late ScJiools-Inquiry Commission.

   The Commission had been presided over by Lord Taimton, and had presented
an elaborate report within the last year. It had not been instructed to inquire into
those endowments which were designed to promote elementary education, nor
into those of the nine great foimdation schools, including Eton, Harrow, and Win-
cliester. Its work had extended over the whole of the vast field of investigation
lying between these two extremes ; and -svithin this area it had found no less than
820 endowed foundations which had been intended to give, or which were now
actually giving secondary or higher education. The gross annual revenue of the
charities to which these schools belong is £336,201. But of this sum a part is
appropriated to the maintenance of almshouses or other eleemosynary objects, and
that income, after all deductions are made for management, amounts to £195,184
for the maintenance of the schools, besides £14,264 in the form of exhibitions,

generally intended for the use of such pupils as proceed to the universities. These
sums, however, represent very inadequately the resources of the foundation schools

for besides these there is in nearly every case a freehold school-room, besides

grounds and a dwelling-house or houses for the master and for the reception of

boarders. All this is, of course, additional to any fees which may be charged to
parents, and may be considered as a provision either for enabling scholars to

obtain superior education -without payment, or at least for cheapening education

for those who could only afford to pay a portion of its market price. The amount
of endowment varies considerablj'. The richest foimdation in the kingdom is
Christ's Hospital, with a net income of £42,000, while a few are endowed with

nothing more than a small tenement which serves as a school-house, and a rent-
charge of £5 or £10 per annum. There are nine foundations -with incomes exceedino-

£2000, thirteen others -witli upwards of £1000, fifty-five with less than £1000 and
more than £500, 222 with less than £500 but more than £100, while the remainder
are endowed with less than £100 per annum each. Similar inequalities appear in
the local distribution of the schools, although the modei-n facilities of commimica-
tion render this a minor evil, one which scarcely calls for a remedy, except so far
as day schools are concerned. Yet the Commissioners report that in the London
district the net sum arising from grammar-school endowments is £56,000 ; in
Yorkshire, upwards of £18,000; in Lancashire, £9000.; Lincolnshire, £7000;
while Cornwall, which stands lowest on the list of counties, has no more than
£400, and buildings of very little value. But the most serious revelations of the

Commissioners relate to the educational condition of the schools. On this point

the evidence is very copious, occupving nearly twenty volumes, and it is almost
                                                                                                  11*
164 REPORT--1868.

impossible to summarize it. But the total number of boys professing to belong

to these 820 schools is 9279 warders and 27,.595 day scholars, a number wholly

inadequate when the capacity of the school-rooms and the resources of the trustees

are considered ; and of this number very few are receiving the classical education

contemplated by the founders, while the general instruction in other subjects is,

as a rule, of very inferior quality. Indeed the very existence of the statutes pre-
scribing the ancient learning often serves as an excuse for withholding any modern

addition to it. It had been his own duty as Assistant Commissioner to visit

about 120 schools, and to report thereon to the Commission. Of these there were

perhaps twenty which deserved the name of good schools, including five or six

which stood in the foremost rank for efficiency ; but of the rest scarcely any would

pass muster as respectable National Schools, while the large majority were, in

material equipment, in method, in the quality of the instruction, and in the

brightness and mental activity of the scholars, very much below even that hum-

ble standard. Similar evidence abounded in the reports of the Assistant Commis-

sioners, particularly in those of Mr. Fearon and of Mr. Bryce. The paper proceeded

to discuss the constitution of bodies of trustees, the freehold tenurerof the master-

ships, and other hindrances to the proper development of the schools. At present

--three authorities exist for rectifying abuses and creating new schemes Parliament,

initiates proceedings, or deals with a school or gi'oup of schools on any general

plan. They provide no security for the continued efficiency of the schools, or for

their development according to the future needs of the people. Above all, Par-

liamentaiy and Chancery schemes for single institutions are all alike hampered by an

--attempt to keep as close as possible to the intentions of the founders an attempt

which often perpetuates capricious and mischievous regulations, and puts a bar to

future improvement. The statesmanship of the future would probably reverse the

whole law of inheritance, and ask boldly by what right the pious founders of these

institutions were to go on for generations legislating on a subject on which private,

irresponsible, and local regulations were likely to be especially mischievous, and

on which the supreme intelligence of the nation, as represented in Parliament,

ought first to be heard. By the law of France, no man is permitted to bequeath

money for any public purpose to a private corporation of trustees nominated by

himself; every such bequest, if made at all, must be confided to the administra-

tion of a persunne cioile, or some Corporation, municipal or otherwise, known to

the law, and responsible to the civil authority. Instances were given showing the

need of some energetic restraint in this country on the power a testator now pos-

sesses of enacting laws with a view rather to gratify his own vanity or selfishness,

or to promote some false theory of education, than to promote the public interest.

Meanwhile the Royal Coinmissioners had not recommended any change in the

law of  inheritance                                                       but they had put fortli a plan for organizing and utilizing the
                                                                       ;

existing endowment, which deserved the earnest attention of the public. They

proposed to establish in each of the eight divisions of the Registrar-General a

local Board of Commissioners, with power to fix the grade of each endowed

school, to convert useless or effete endowments into exhibitions, to rearrange,

where necessary, the local distribution of the schools, to institute periodical in-

spection, and to report publicly on each of them. These local Boards are to work

in harmony with a central authority, to be formed by enlarging and strengthening

the present Charity Commission, and by giving to it a more distinctly educational

character. Another of the Commissioners' recommendations was, that there

should be a Council composed of representatives of the Universities, which should

be empowered to examine and to certify teachers of all grades, and to give unity

and system to other general examinations, whether obligatorj' on the endowed

schools, or voluntary in relation to private schools. By this and other means, which

were described in detail, it would be possible to introduce order and organization into

the chaos of our secondary instruction, and possibly at some future time to absorb tlie

present machiuer}' of the Privy Council Office, and thus to give unity to the educa-

tion of the whole country. Pleasures lilce this would, when the time came for dis-

cussing them in Parliament, encounter much opposition, partly from self-interest, and

partly from a traditional tenderness towards the wishes of testators, which had

The Condition of the Agnndtuml Labourer, specicdli/ in the West of Enr/lmuh
          By the Eev. Edwaed Giedlestone, M.A., Canon of Bristol.

The progress of manufacture so far from lessening has rather increased the \alue

of land. Fortunes made in manufacture are generally invested in land. .Skill

acquired in manufacture is applied to laud. Great Britain retains and is likely

always to retain its character as an agricultural country. Landowners occupy the

highest positions and enjoy the greatest social previleges. Public opiuion, the

reform of universities and public schools, the facility for foreign travel, and the

admixture of the manufacturing classes with the old landed proprietors have much

raised the character and improved the tone of these last, fetill, especially in the

West of England, there are many persons remaining who resist all progress. The

race of farmers is also much improved, but not so much in the West of England

as elsewhere.  The  land  is  also  much  improved                                                                                                                                        a larger  acreage  is  brought  into
                                                                                       ;

cultivation, and each acre is made to yield more. In this respect, also, in the

West of England there is less improvement than elsewhere. Nowhere has the

improvement of the agricultural labourer kept pace with that of the landowner,

the farmer, and the land itself In the AVest of England the condition of the

labourer is very little improved, and in some respects is worse than it used to be

wages are low, fuel and provisions dearer. Education has become a necessary

of life for a famih^ The poor-rate is so administered as to quench every feeling

of independence. In the West of England an agricultural labourer had, till lately,

only 7s. or 8s. a week, and now only 8s. or 9s. Unless he is a horsekeeper or a

shepherd, he has to pay out of this from Is. to Is. (id., or more, a week, for house-

rent, and to provide food, clothing, medical attendance, fuel, and evei-y other

necessary for himself, wife, and family. Potatoe ground he pays a high rent

for; and fuel he seldom gets except at a cost of as many hoiu-s of hard work in

Hegetting it as are its full value.       has three pints or two quarts of cider a

day, and has a poi-tion of his wages often paid in gTist, which when corn is dear is

an .advantage, but otherwise a loss to him. He is often not allowed to keep a pig

or poultry for fear of stealing food for them from his master. He works, nomi-

nally, ten or ten and a half hours a day, with an hour and a half deducted for

meals. He is almost always, however, in reality kept a much longer time than this,

and is seldom paid anything for overtime, except by bread and cheese in harvest

time. Women get 7d. or 8d. a day for outdoor work, with a quart of cider,

and boys smaller sums in proportion. The men breakfast before they leave home

on teakettle broth, wliich consists of an infusion of bread and water with a

little milk, when it can be got. For luncheon or dinner, which they take with

them, they have coarse bread and a little hard, dry, skim-milk cheese at 3d. per
lb. For supper, on their return home, th'ij have potatoes or cabbage, with a

very small slice of bacon sometimes to give a ilavour. Butchers' meat they

seldom get except it is given to them. They are unable to lay by anything ; and
few comjjaratively belong to benefit societies. They are long-lived, but even in

their prime feeble, and at the age of hfty often crippled with rheumatism, the re-

sult of poor living, sour cider, a damp climate, hard work, and anxiety combined.

There remains nothing for them then but parish pay and the Union. There
are many exceptions to this general ride, often even in contiguous parishes, owing

to the presence of an intelligent resident land-owner, or the immediate neighbour-
hood of a large town, mines, or manufactures. In other parts of England the rates of
wages difler much. The wages of tlie agricultural labourer are alwaA's higher in
the neighbourhood of towns, mines, and manuiactures. More than 100 labourers
have been sent from the parish of Halbertou raid other parts of North Devon into
Bedfordshire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, Durham, Glamorganshire, Hampshire, Hert-
                                                                                                                ;

fordshire, Kent, Lancashire, Shropshire, Sun-ey, Yorkshire, more than half being

married men with families, at wages rarying from 12s. a week, the lowest, with

house and garden rent free, to 20s. a week, with house and garden rent free. In
all cases the house and garden were rent free, and in some cases there has been

fuel and potatoe groimd, one or more, given in addition. The single men who
have been sent away are getting from 6s. to 8s. a week; with board, lodging, and

washing.

   From the above statement it is clear that the condition of the agi-· icuijl. tmaii
labourer is in different parts of the country very difterent. But notwithstandmg

statistics, which in this, as in the case of education, are very deceptive, and general

statements made by persons of no experience, the fact that in agricultural districts

the poor-rate is very high, that there are more marks than signatures in the

maiTiage registers, that recruits from the same district are seldom able to read or

write, that our prisons are tilled from the same districts, and the general convic-

tion that agricultural labourers are wholly unfit to be trusted with the franchise,
are real and reliable evidences of the low condition of this class of men. That

which is really required for the agricultm-al labourer  is, in one word,                  independence
at present he is the most dependent of any class of
                                                        labourers. To                      effect this :--

First, good wages in proportion to quantity and quality of work, but always, in the

case of an able-bodied and industrious man, enough to keep him and his family,

with a margm for insiu-ance against old age and sickness, are required. Secondli/,

also well-drained and ventilated houses, vn(h at least three_ bed-rooms, and all

other appliances for decency, with a pro^nsion also against taking in lodgers, such

houses to be in the  control" of  the  landowner  rather than of the  farmer.                                   Thirdly.

                                                                                                             _

Greater facilities for education. Even a penny a week for each child in a large

family is a heavy tax on a very small income. The temptations held out
by the farmers of a few pence for bovs to keep birds and do other child's work

is too great for the poor laboiu-er to resist. No child should be allowed to work

till he can read and wi'ite well, and has a fair knowledge of the first rules of
arithmetic. Fourthly. All mops and hiring fairs shoiUd be abolished, and a good

system of registration be generally adopted and made known through the instru-

mentality of the penny papers "throughout the country. Fifthly. Agricultural

Labourers' Unions, of a"strictlv protective character, and well guarded against in-

timidation to either employers "or fellow workmen, might be formed with advantage.
The whole system of unio'ns is not to be condemned because of the outi-ages com-

mitted by a few. All professions, all trades, even landowners and farmers, in
Whytheir Chambers of Agricidture, have their unions.
                                                           are agricultural labourers

alone to be left to struggle hopelessly, because singly, while all others are com-

bined ? Sixthly. There should be legislation in favour of the agricultural labourers,

specially as regards education, and the administration of the Poor Law by a cen-

tral board of disinterested officers instead of a local board of landowners and

farmers. Legislation, so far, has done less for this than for any_ other class.
Landowners and farmers have a special pecuniary interest in the improvement

of the agricultural labourer. The clergy have a spiritual interest. All bread-
winners ought to help him to raise himself to the same independence to which all

except he has attained. All that can be done by an individual is to cooperate

with  any persons who  are willing to take this good work  in  hand                       or,  failing the
                                                                                       ;

   That part of the" great level of the fens called the Bedford level, extending into
the counties of Cambridge, Norfolk, Suffollc, and Huntingdon, comprising about
300,000 acres, was first attempted to be drained in the eariy part of the seventeenth
century, and has been gradually improved fi-om that period up to the present time.

new rivers, to convey the drainage waters to their outfall.

bad state of the new rivers, were compelled to erect a great number of windmills

for their drainage, and continued to use them till the early part of the nineteenth

century, when very powerful steam-engines driving large scoop wheels were sub-

stituted for the  windmills                                                  and  at  the  present time all the low lands are drained
                                                                          ;

artificially by these engines, which amount to about 1000 horse-power.

In the year 1821 a very important work was carried out for the improvement

of the outfall by making a new cut above the town of Lynn, called the Eau Brink

Cut, which is 3 miles long, and which lowered the water in the upper river in flood

time 10 feet ; this work cost about £100,000.

  The next work of importance was the New IMiddle Drain, which was completed

in the year 1848, which was 11 miles long, and which commenced at Upwell and

extended to Saint Clermans, and was dicharged at the upper end of the Eau Brink

Cut. This di-ain, with the outfall sluice, and making the internal rivers of the

middle level correspond with the new drain, cost upwards of £400,000, which was

apportioned upon the 110,000 acres of the middle level.

In the year 1862, the outfall sluice of this drain gave way, and allowed the tide

to flow up, and ruptiu-ed one of the banks, and inundated about 6,000 acres of land :

since that period the middle level has been drained by sixteen s}-phons, 3 feet 6

inches diameter and 20 feet high, which are worked by a ten horse-power engine,

exhausting the air from the inside by means of an air-pump, and up to the present

time they have drained this large tract of land.

In the year 18.52, a fiu-ther improvement to the outfall was made by the making

of the Norfolk-estuary cut, 3 miles long, below Lynn, which cost about £250,000,

.and which again lowered the water at low water from 3 to 4 feet.
  Notwithstanding these great improvemonts, and these large sums of money

which have been laid out, the greater part of the fen-country is drained by artificial

means, and will continue so till some further great works are carried out for the

improvement of the same.

   Sanitary state of Indians in the Settlement of KanyeageJi, Canada, 1868.

                          By JjVmes Heywood, M.A., F.R.S.

  A considerable number of Indians are scattered as farmers and farm-labourers in

the Indian reserve of Tuscarora, near Brantford, in Canada. The New-England
Company have several missions for the Indians of that reserve, and a new church

has been recently erected at Kanyeageh, in the north-west portion of the district,

which on Sunday contains about"300 Indians, the half of whom are males and the

other half females. The Kev. R. J. Roberts, Church of England missionary at this

station, has collected the following details respecting the health of the Indians in

his neighbourhood who are connected with the Chm-ch of England.
   Ague is the most common disorder in the Indian reserve, and this malady is at-

ti'ibutable to the numerous swamps in the forest. The Indians of that locality
may be regarded as perhaps somewhat more liable to consumption than the

whites.

   During the half-year from the 1st January to the 30th June, 1868, there were
seventeen interments of Indians, either in Kanyeageh Churchyard or in some other

burial-grounds within four miles of that station ; and the diseases in these cases,

where known, are thus enumerated :

two last rivers rising one on each side of the high road at Lopham. There is a
system of small streams that flow into the sea on the north, a similar system flows
into the fens on the west, and all the rest of the drainage of Norfolk, including
about two-thirds of the county, flows into the sea imder Yarmouth bridge.

   The navigation for twenty miles from Yarmouth to Norwich is fairh' kept up
but generally the drainage system is in a deplorable state, as might be expected in
a very flat country where human ingenuity seems to have been employed in ob-

structing instead of helping oft" the water.

On the Progress of Learned Societies, iUustrative of the Advanceynent of Science
  in the United Kingdom during the last Tliirty Years. Bg Prof. Leone

^ Levi, F.S.A., F.S.8.
          The author drew attention to the number and description of our learned societies,

Aand to their progress, as a sure indication of the advance of science.    scientific

census could not be taken by the number of their members, many men of the

highest scientific attainments not belonging to them, many who have several initial

total number of men directly contributing, by their learning or their wealth, to

the promotion of science constitutes about 15 in every 10,000 of the population.

Taking, moreover, the total income of such societies as a basis, it appears that the

resources of science amounted to £4 to every £10,000 of the national income charged

to income tax, such facts contrasting most favourablj' with the time when Mr. Bab-

bage wrote his ' Reflections on the Decline of Science in England,' and when the

British Association was first formed, in th§ year 1830. Having dwelt at length on

--the Professor concluded his observations with the following statement : 1. That

during the last thirty years there has been a large increase in the nimiber and

membership of learned societies in the United Kingdom, a fact indicative of a

decided advancement of science. 2. That, classified into distinct groups, the mem-

bership of learned societies has advanced in the following ratio :

blished principle 8. That the institution of a medal annually granted to dis-

tinguished merit, appears, from the experience of some societies, well calcidated to

afford stimulus to the pursuit of science. 9. And that a united meeting of the

members of aU learned societies should be held for the presentation of such medals,

and for the greater encouragement to science, in the " Royal Albert Hall of Arts

and Science," now in the course of construction, as a memorial to that munificent

patron of science, who with so much wisdom and dignity presided over one of the

            0)1 t7ie Present State of the Question of International Coinage.

                              Bij Prof. Leoxe Levi, F.S.A., F.S.S.

   Having shown the practical character of the question at issue, and the im-

portance attached to it by the jiu-ies of international exhibitions, the statistical
congresses, the chambers of commerce, the Society of Arts, and other public bodies,
he examined the respective advantages of either adopting a new unit altogether
for all nations, or one of the existing units by all of them, or a correlation of all

the different imits. The first plan, of adopting five or ten grains of gold as a new

unit, would be impracticable, because it would require a general recoinage by all
nations. The second plan, that of choosing one from the existing imits, was

better ; and the choice would depend on the number of persons among whom the

same unit is already in circulation, the amount of trade which is regulated by such
unit, the amount of coinage of the same already issued, and the relative conve-
nience of the different systems. As regards the population, the pound circulates in
England with 30,000,000 of people ; the franc in trance, Italy, Belgium, Switzer-
land, which have collectively 70,000,000 ; the dollar in the United States, which
have 31,000,000 ; the florin 'in Austria, which has 34,00,000; the thaler in Ger-
many and Prussia, which have 54,000,000 ; and the rouble in European Russia,
having 59,000,000 of people. The franc, therefore, prevails among the largest
number of persons. As regards trade, whilst the imports and exports of England
in 1865 amount to £490,000,000, those of France, Italy, Belgium, and Switzerland
in the same year amounted to £480,000,000, and those of the United States to
£105,000,000.' England here has the preeminence, though not so decided as one

might imagine. And as regards the amount of coinage issued, whilst up to 1850 the

issue of gold coin in England f^xr exceeded that of France and the United States, it

has not been so since that time. From 1793 to 1806 France issued £262,500,000

of gold coins ; the United Kingdom, from 1816 to 1866, £187,000,000 ; the United
States, from 1792 to 1849, £109,000,000. Since 1850, France, £197,000,000 ; the
United Kingdom, £91,000,000 ; the United States, £152,006,000. As regards the
relative convenience of the diflerent sj'stems, it was a fact that, whilst this country
has been for years labouring to establish a decimal coinage, France and the United
States long possessed it ; whilst, moreover, for international purposes, the pound
was too large a unit. In three, therefore, out of the four elements, France has
the advantage, and that induced the Congress to take the French coin as a basis.
But the Congress did not recommend the franc as a imit for all nations, nor did it

recommend the pound. As a step in advance, it recommended a mode of har-
monizing the different systems in existence, according to which we should alter
the pound to 2~> francs exactly, instead of 25 francs, 20 cents., as it is now intrin-
sically worth. Can this be done ? Should this compromise he accepted, the

evil war', that it would cause a great change in nil the monetary systems. It
would require us to lower, though in an intiuitesimal manner, the gold standard,
and yet leave all the existing units in existence. The accounts would still be

kept in diiferent ways, the divisional coins would in uoA\dse agree, and wp should
not get a good decimal coinage. The author thought that tlie 10-franc piece in gold,
of the value of 100 new pence (slightly diminished in their present relative value),

with the unit of 100 francs, or £4, for larger financial operations, was the best
rmit offered for all nations. Such a unit, divided into ten silver pieces of lOcl
each, would give also an excellent decimal coinage, producing immense facilities in

education and great ease in calculations. And in that way vco should have one unit
identicall)^ alike everywhere, instead of the 100 units now in existence, and tlie

identity would be obtained, not onlj' in the gold unit, but in its subordinate coins
of sih-er and copper. Allowing that the International Monetary Congress had
immensely ad%-anced the question, he trusted that tlie Iteport of "the Royal Com-
missioners would recommend the holding of another conference for tlie purpose of

considering the possibilitj' of agreeing in one common system of coinage, instead
of the proposod adaptation of many systems.

        Some Statistics relating to tlie Civil Service. By Horace Mann.

   The object of the paper was to supply a few facts and figures, so that outsiders
might obtain a notion of the Civil Service. This was done under the heads of
the numerical force of the service, the number of its departments, its nomencla-

ture, remunerations, comnetitive examinations, sehei.irs of examination, and limits

of age. The paper concluded by the expression of the belief that it had made
confusion conspicuous, and had indicated a picture of disorder, the natural result
of a disintegrated service. The paper would fail of its design if it did not leave
on the mind an impression, however faint, of the Ci's'il Service as a chaotic mass

--of unorganized elements an aggTegate of separate departments, governed in many
--points by no common principles with difierent kinds of work for the same kind of

officer, and with varying nomenclature, varying remuneration, varying standards of

examination, and varying practice as to the mode of appointment", all these varia-

tions being out of all proportion -with the real variations existing in the subject-

matter dealt with. What would be the appropriate reniedj^ for some, at least,

of the evils of this state of things was a question which must bo reserved for

   The special comLinatiou considered in tlie paper, liowever, was the third, as
showing the low rate of mortality among iron- and coal-miners, in comparison

with the same of tin, lead, and copper. This was accounted for principally by

the very inferior ventilation in the latter three classes of mines, the temperature in

one copper-mine mentioned being as high as 125° F. (51°-6 C), whilst, at the same

time, this great heat engendered the absorption of deleterious matter into the

system, as regarded lead- and copper-miners, and without doubt greatly increases
Athe noxious efiects of their occupation.
                                                                                                                                                    table was also given showing the

mortality of the different classes of miners for the forty years _of life interveniuo-

between twenty-five and sixty-five years of age, from which it appeared that,

whilst the same among iron- and coal-miners was at the rate of 13 and 14 deaths

per 1000 living, among lead- and copper-miners it was as high as 20 and 24

per 1000.

Of occupations in general, all those connected with agriculture were shown to

be by far the healthiest, these occupations, being those of labourers in rural

districts, husbandmen, gardeners, and farmers ; and their position as regarded

health was in the order they are respectively placed. Sawyers, millers, shoe-

makers, weavers, labourers in towns and cities, and bricklayers were, in the order

given, above the average in health, whilst shipwrights, servants, blacksmiths,

carpenters and joiners, and whitesmiths were in the same degree below it.
Butchers, and others engaged in connexion with animal food, such as fishmongers,

poulterers, and provision-curers, were given as experiencing a very high mortality,

infiuenced, most probably, by the inhalation of an air always more or less im-

pregnated with animal matter, whilst at the same time the partaking of an undue

amount of animal food would, no doubt, have a veiy deleterious effect. Chronic

bronchitis, engendered by the large quantities of dust always pervading the occu-

pation of stonemasons and those engaged in the earthenware manufacture, renders

their calling very unhealthy, so that the mortality in these classes is high. In the

factoiy occupations, independently of the diseases produced by special branches,

the influence of bad ventilation is more or lees prominent throughout. In no

other class of persons, however, was the mortality shown to be so liigh as amono-

those connected with drinks and stimulants, which class, it may be specified,

comprised beersellers, wine and spirit merchants, publicans and licensed vic-

tuallers, and inn-keepers and hotel-keepers. In these occupations the effect was

most marked at the younger ages, namely, twenty-five to forty-five ; for in

these only does the mortality at this period of life attain as high a rate as 17 per

1000 living'; as, notwithstanding all the unhealthy and injurious influences to

which those engaged in mining, the earthenware manufacture, and several of the

most obnoxious factory occupations are exposed, in none is the mortalitv for this

period of life above 14 per 1000, whereas in England and Wales generally it

would be but 10 per 1000, and among labourers in rural districts and gardeners as

low as at the rate of 6 per 1000 living.

In conclusion it was stated, as affording perhaps the best exemplification of the

great influence of occupation upon health, that, if the mortality for the period of

life under observation, namely, twenty-five to sixty-five, was compared with those

two of the standard tables at present in use which may be supposed to represent

the two extremes of longevity, tiie mortality would be confined between the two

rates of  13 and 16-7 per lOOO living                                                                                                         yet,  great as  is  the  eftect of  occupation, the
                                                                                                                                           ;

mortality in one class is over 188 per cent, more than that in another.

and Military Stations.

   Connected with the Female Hospital, an Asylum has been in existence for the
last eighty j-ears, aftbrding to those desirous of its advantages a home for the
present, and a prospect of useful and respectable employment for the future.

   An extension of the female hospital took place in connexion with Government

on the passing of the Contagious L)iseases Act, and at present one hundred and

twenty beds are at the disposal of the War Office, which defrays the expenses of

the Government wards, the patients being sent from naval and military stations.
    It has been officially stated that, since the operation of the Contagious Diseases

Act, disease amongst the naval and military population has been reduced 50
per cent.

   There are thirty beds in constant occupation at the Female Lock Hospital for

ordinary patients.

   At the Male Hospital, Dean Street, there are only fifteen beds for ordinaiy male
patients ; but it is hoped that the number maj' be increased to thirty, as there are
many cases requiring constant care and treatment.

As gold must be the ultimate standard of monetary value, it will be admitted to

be of great and lasting importance that it sliould be made so in the form which is

theoretically the simplest; in other words, «« that form irhich trill vieritiibb/ prove

Nowmost convenient in the long run.  tlie gTam of pure gold in a coin has the

requisite properties in the greatest attainable degree, and it happens to have a rela-

tion to existing coins which very much smooths the way for its introduction.

It has the requisite properties, because it is more natural to take pure gold as our

standard than an alloy, just as it is most natural to take distilled water, and at a

natural though unusual temperature, as om' standard of specific gravity; and a

little consideration will show that in both cases the same kind of permanent con-

venience will be the result. And if some mass of pure gold is to be our radix, it

vrill at once be conceded that the quantity to be taken should bear the simplest

attainable relation to the best system of weights. The gram of pure gold is there-

fore the Natitial Standard.

   Calling, then, the value of each gTam of pure coined gold a monad, we may (in

conformity with metrical nomenclature ) form the following decimal series :

Ivilion, or kilogram of gold.        Decim, or decigi'am of gold.
Hekat, or hektogram of gold.         Cent, or centigram of gold.
Deka, or dekagram of gold.           Mil, or milligram of gold.
Monad, or gram of gold.

   The present silver and copper coins of Great Britain are of less than their nominal
values, but the artificial values of these coins are kept up by their being made
exchangeable with gold at the rate, fixed by statute, of 20 shillings to the sovereign
and by providing that silver and copper shall not be legal tenders for others than

very small debts, so that no one can be forced to talce a large quantity of the coins

Nowwhose value is artificial.  our existing coinage would be adjusted to the new

one by slightly altering this artificial value, and legislating that after a certain

date the sovereign shall be exchangeable for 20 shillings and 4 pence, and the

half-sovereign for 10 and 2 pence. In this way the present nominal values of our

existing silver and copper coins would be lowered to the extent of one-sixty-first

part, which is less than half the change which would be required in some part of

om- coinage upon the adoption of either the pound and mil, or the five-franc

scheme. Moreover, all contracts above one pound sterling would be wholly un-

--affected, and the relation of our silver to our copper coins would be undisturbed

the former of these being the condition which it is of most importance to observe

in regard to large transactions, and the latter what is of most importance in regard

to small.

   After the change, the sovereign and half-sovereign would maintain their present
values in virtue of their being gold: there would still be 7 monads and 32 cents
in the sovereign, 3 monads and 66 cents in the half-sovereign. The penny would
become precisely three cents, and the only British coins which would not fall in
with the new ones would be the halfpenny of 15 mils and the farthing of 7^ mils.

   The copper coins proper to the new system would be the cent, the two-cent, and

the three-cent or penny. In comitries where smaller coins wo^lld be useful a five-

mil piece (equivalent to one-sixth of a penny) might be added. In silver we should

have the decim (about the size of a threepenny piece), the two-decim, the tbrce-
decim (value for tenpeuce), the five-decim, and" the seven-decim. The half-crown
is a nine-decim piece, and would add another coin of the series so long as it remains
in circulation. The gold coins would be a seven-monad piece (about the size of a
sovereign), a five-monad piece, and a three-monad piece, worth 100 pence. The

monad is worth 33 pence and a cent. These coins are so selected that very small
payments can be made by exchanging the larger coins, and that change of a large
coin can be obtained in several different ways. These are both of them matters of

much practical convenience. The gold coins should have the weights of pure gold
they contain stated on them ; for example, on the largest coin, " This coin contains
7 grams of gold." If the alloy for the three gold coins were jfths fine, they would
weigh exactly 77 grams, 5-5 grams, and 3'3 grams. Accounts would be most con-

veniently kept in three columns of dekas, monads, and cents.
   The pound and mil scheme has the advantage over that which is here advocated

that it would retain permanently the British pound and shilling ; hut at the same
time it woidd do great violence to the values of our copper coins to force them into
accordance with it : it would alter the relation between the existing silver and
copper coins, the relation with which ignorant people have to deal ; and above all

it is arbitrary, and has little chance of becoming international or permanent. On

the other hand a truly natural system, if once adopted by Great Britain, would
inevitably make its way by its intrinsic merit among all sufficiently intelligent
nations : just as the metrical system of weights and measures, after it was adopted
by one great nation, is thns spreading, because it is not only a decimal system but
natural also, /. e. one in which the measures of length, of surface, of capacity, and
the weights are all related to one another in that way which is theoretically the
simplest, in other words, in the way which is sure to prove practically the most
convenient upon a sufficiently wide experience.

   The proposal to make the dollar of five francs our unit is undoubtedly recom-
mended by the circumstance that this dollar is a coin which agrees tolerably with

some part of the existing coinage of several countries. But the advantage is tran-

sitory, and coidd only be secured at the price of fastening upon the world a coinage
with the following three permanent defects :

   1. The dollar is a unit less adapted than a larger unit for estimating considerable
sums, and at the same time its next decimal multiple, the ten-dollar piece, lias

been found inconveniently large.

    2. It does not fall in with the metrical system of weights and measm-es, since

the dollar of five francs, being the fourth part of a napoleon, contains 145 centigrams

of gold. This defect entails many lasting disadvantages, and among them that
   3. On this account it would be exceedingly difficult, or rather quite impracticable,

to keep it up to its value in the units of all nations.

   There is only one coiu-se which -n-ill provide in the most effectual way that is

attainable against the tampering with coinage of which the world has' seen so

many disgraceful examples, and that is to make the numerical relation between

the weight of pure gold in a coin and the statement of its value the simplest pos-

sible ; and there is but one way of doing this, viz. by taking the gTam of pure
gold as the imit of value. The number that represents the value of a coin would
then bear the simplest relation that is possible to its fineness and its weight. Thus
if the coin be }|ths fine, weigh it in centigrams, subtract one-twelfth from the
number of centigrams, and the remainder expresses the value of the coin in cents.

   Finally, it would be well to keep in view that there is something which men

will naturally regard with approval in the maintenance of a gold coinage at as high
a standard of fineness as is compatible with wear.

   It may reasonably be lu-ged that it is by a regard to such feelings, and by con-
siderations of durability and other valuable physical properties, that we should be
principally guided in deciding what fineness shall he given to our coins. The

coinage of Great Britain stands foremost in reputation over the world, a position

partly won by its fineness, a position which does credit to us as a nation, and which
we ought not lightly to resign. If we rendered our coinage a truly natural system
by bringing it into harmony with the metrical system of weights and measures, so
as to blend all (weights, measures, and coinage) into one consistent whole, we
should be lasting benefactors of mankind in the same sense in which the French

--were when they gave existence to the metrical system a system which, wherever

it is adopted, is destined to benefit all posterity.

   The best way to begin the inti-oductiou of the natural system of coinage woidd

probably be to coin copper cents with the inscription, " This coin is worth one
centigram of gold." The cent shoidd pass current as one-third of a penny. This
might be followed up by withdi-awiug the halfpenny, the farthing, and the three-
penny piece from circidation, and by issuing a silver decim or ten-cent piece. This

coin would be worth o pence and a cent, and should bear the inscription, " Worth

one decif^'am of orold,"

                          MECHANICS.

Address by George Parker Bidder, C.E., F.R.G.S., President of the Section.

--Gkntlejien and Ladies, In opening the proceedings of the Section, I have to

offer a few remarks, which I do with the utmost diffidence, because this is the lirst
occasion on which I have liad the honour of being present at these Meetings. The
leading object of the Association, as stated in the first paragraph of the programme,

is to give a stronger impulse and a more systematic direction to scientific inquiry

and ifI wanted an illustration of the manner in which this object is to be carried out,
I should take it from the discussion upon Ur. Richardson's proposition, which was

to the effect that the scope and object of this Section is to consider the application
of the laws of mechanics to all mechanical operations for the benefit of the world in

o-eneral, and of this country in particular. I may here say that we have at least

this advantage, that the laws v^^e seek to apply are undoubted and imquestioned,
and that their best application must conduce to the benefit of mankind at large.
I propose, on the present occasion, to refer briefly, and only very generally, to

some of the topics which are at the present moment engrossing the attention of

the public.

  First I will deal with what I may call the great water question. In speaking

upon this subject, I desire, at the outset, to congratulate the Section upon the pre-
sence at this Meeting of several of the highest and most eminent authorities upon

this question, among whom I may mention Mr. Hawksley, whose name is associated

with almost all the water-works of the United Kingdom, and with many foreign
works of analogous character; and Mr. Bateman, who, among other works, has
been the author of the great system by which the water of Loch Katrine is now

conveyed to the city of Glasgow. I trust, therefore, that this Section will

not disperse without having obtained that amount of useful and valuable in-
formation which these gentlemen are so capable of commimicating. The entire

question of water supply is one which has already assumed considerable pro-
portions. It deals with the supply of water to the large cities and towns of

this kingdom, with the utilization of that water for a variety of purposes^ con-

nected with our manufactories, with the preservation of the beauty of our rivers,

and the prevention of their pollution by the drainage of our towns and the

refuse of our factories. Indeed a more beautiful and interesting subject can

hardly engage the attention of engineers ; and it may be said that it constitutes,

in point of fact, the sensational literature of our profession. Whether we look to

the circumstances and the constitution of the great rivers which flow through

India, through America, and through the continent of Europe, or whether we

--turn to the smaller streams which circulate in this neighbourhood, we find one

general law pervading the whole a law which is well understood, and about which

there can ho no possibility of doubt. jS'ature, we know, always perforins her

functions by means of general laws, and we find these general laws always
Weconduce to one result.
                          find that nature has provided, for the flow of

water in our rivers, that the greatest rainfalls shall take place in the highest

re"-ions. The mountains receive the water from the clouds, and the water is

brought down to the plains, where it is utilized for supplying om- towns, for con-

veying our commerce from place to place, and, to a large extent, in some parts

of the world, for irrigation. And we know that if this supply were properly pre-
served, irrigation might be considerably increased. The rainfall is conducted down

the sides of the nioiuitains, amidst rocks and through substances where it can do

little harm, with the velocity due to the slopes of the region, and by the time it

approaches the plains, it converges into streams which flow in an even and gentle

course, conferring the greatest blessings upon mankind, although occasionally, but
very seldom, committing some amount of ravage and harm. To show what

nature eftects in this way, I may state that in the Himalayas the quantity of

water which falls from the clouds amounts to something like 400 inches per

annum. In some of the mountains of Cumberland the rainfall has been gauged

to the extent of 200 inches, and in this neighourhood it is said to be very little
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  181

over 20 inches per anmim. The late Mr. Eohert Stephenson told me that upon
one occasion in the Andes, the rainfall amounted to as much as 8 inches within the

short space of an hour. This is a question assuming so great importance that I
think this Association ought to use all its power and influence to induce the
Government to aid it in these investigations, by which alone the engineer can
be guided in the application of the laws to which I have alluded. I think that
the quantity of water which falls along the whole coiu-se of our rivers should be

ganged, that the rainfall at diflerent intervals should also be measured, and that

there should likewise be meteorological observations, for the purpose of ascertain-

ing the condition of the atmosphere under which these rainfalls occur. I think

that if these observations were persevered in for a few years, a mass of facts might

be collected which might, by the aid of the great and extensive knowledge of my

friends now present, be applied to the permanent benefit of this country.
   The remarks I have just made may, to some extent, be illustrated bj' circtmi-

stances connected with the rivers in this immediate neighbourhood. As you are
aware, the rivers Wensum and Yare converge at a point a little below this city.
The river Waveney joins them a little below Eeedham, and the river Bare flows
into them at a point not far from Yarmouth, the whole of the water being con-

veyed thence through the harboiu* into the sea. There is no doubt that formerly
there was in this locality a gi-eat estuary open to the ocean, but the travelling
sands which form the dunes upon this coast seem to have confined that water
within the narrow channel which falls into the ocean at Gorlestone. I believe

that at one period the \Vaveney flowed through Mutford lock, and that a dam was

erected there by the advice of some Dutch engineers, with a view to prevent the

incursion of the sea, which doubtless inflicted upon the upper lands much greater

injury than could be caused by the freshwater floods. But, be this as it may, if
you trace the Wensiun from its course down the valley, flowing at a gentle rate, and
aftbrding nourishment to a considerable tract of country between Norwich and Yar-
mouth, )-ou will find that the entire flow of the water is maintained by a fall of
something like 4 or o inches in the mile. This circumstance is undoubtedly attended
with great advantage to the neighbourhood. In the first place, the waters of the Yare
are free from any large amount of deposit, while the velocity of the stream is so slight
that it does not have the eflfect of destroying or injuring the banks, which are com-
posed of a soft material, and the river being deep, enables a large amount of com-
merce to be carried on between Yarmouth and Norwich by those beautiful craft,
the wherries, which navigate these waters. Such is the facility aflbrded by the
river for the conveyance of traffic, that these wherries maintain to this moment an
active competition with the railway which runs between this place and Yarmouth.

Near Yarmouth we have the entire body of water belonging to this district con-

verging at the head of Breydon, and all the circumstances connected with these

waters are subject to laws which we can estimate with perfect certainty. But
beyond the point I have alluded to they come in contact with the tide ; and here

commences a disturbing element, upon which a great variety of opinion is main-

tained, and which has, I am aware, led to much litigation.

   Yarmouth has also this fm-ther natural condition, that being surroimded by a
vast amoimt of sand, which forms the roadstead, the residt is that, although on
both sides of the coast, at Aldborough and on the estuary near Lynn, the tide
rises from 16 to 18 feet at springs, neveitheltss it only rises some 5 feet at Y'ar-
mouth. The consequence is that the tidal scour at Yarmouth is very much
reduced, and the effect is so much modified that it occasions a large outlay in
maintaining even the present depth of water over the bar, inadequate as that may be.
But if the range of the tide through the port of Yarmouth had con-esponded with that
upon each side at the places I have mentioned, it is a question whether its effect

Myupon the estuary of the river would not be of the most disastrous character.
own opinion is that such would he the effect ; but my more immediate object is to

call attention to the tidal influences, combined vdth the fresh water from the land,

in the maintenance of the bar at Yarmouth. Upon the question of how much is
due to the land floods, and how much to the flux and reflux of the tide, there is
great diiference of opinion among philosophers and engineers. It is, indeed, a

difficult question ; but I think it is one that ought to be grappled with, and one
182 REPORT~1868.

the solution of ·«-liich this Association ought to keep in ^iew. I think that

by the collection of records of accurate and well-established facta, we might he

enabled to arrive at something like a sound practical conclusion upon it; and this

leads me to a suggestion as to what this Association might do in the matter.

Let us take the case of the Yarmouth estuary in particular. If before coming to

Norwich notice had been given to the Commissioners at Yarmouth and the autho-

rities at Lowestoft, I have no doubt that the -i^ssociation might have been sup-

plied with a series of tidal observations and charts showing the condition of the

harbour at diiferent periods, due to the -sarious works which had been executed.

This information might have been rendered of exti'eme utility. Next year you meet

at Exeter, near the estuary of the Exe, which is, to some extent, analogous to

the locality of which I have been speaking ; and I would,suggest that this Associa-
tion should apply to the authorities at Exiuouth for such information as they possess

with reference to their harl^our.

The result of the convergence of the rivers at Y'"armoulh was to give to that port

a monopoly of the whole trade of this district ; and the effect of that monopoly

was, as in the case of most other mouopolies, though doubtfully beneficial to the

port of Yarmouth, certainly not advantageous to this city or to the neighbour-

ing district. So much had this been felt that, forty-three years ago, the late Sir

William Cubitt obtained an Act of Parliament for the construction of the harbour

of Lowestoft, and I think the capital required to carrv out that undertaking was

chiefly provided by this city. But the capital was insufficient for the execution of

the worivs upon such a scale as would enable the harbour to be used to any great

extent, and until the railway Company took the matter in liand, and made Lowes-

toft what it is, the full advantages which Yarmouth could give to this district

were never realized. The Yarmouth authorities then set about improving their

harbour, reducing the charges, and conferring other advantages, of which this city

has reaped the beneiit. And now you have two harbours within a few miles of

each other, constituted on totally dift'erout principles. You have that of Yar-

mouth, maintained by the flow of the land waters of the Yare, the Yv'aveney, the

"\^'eusuni, and the Bare ; and you have that of Lowestoft, which is maintained

entirely bj" di-edging, there being no land water, with the exception of the small

quantity which is allowed to pass through during the process of locking the

myvessels. It is  belief that the result of a thorough investigation of this ques-

tion, conducted by competent persons, would show tbat the land waters conduce

but little, if at all, to the maintenance of the port of Yarmouth, and that they

might be allowed, to some extent, to pass tiirough to the sea in otlier directions,

by which means a large area of land would be effectually drained, other land irri-

gated, an unfailing supply of water rendered available for tlie towns, and the har-

bours of Yarmouth and Lowestoft be maintained and rendered accessible to vessels

of larger burthen. This is, however, a topic of purely local importance.

There is another topic, which is of worldwide celebrity, to which I must call

attention. It is one of vast interest to science, and may throw a light on some

other questions. I allude to an undertaking which has excited considerable atten-

tion, from its pretensions to connect the Mediterranean with the Eed Sea by a

canal across the Isthmus of Suez. Tliat canal is now approaching completion. I
believe that eycvj man of liberal nrind would desire to see that great work

successfully completed. Tlie canal passes in its course through what is kno^vn

as the Bitter Lakes, which have a depression of some 40 feet below the level
of the Red Sea. The depression is perfectly dry, and is covered by a stratum

of salt, which is used by tlie natives. This depression must be filled with water

from the Red Sea, from which it is distant about eighteen miles. The most inter-

esting circumstance connected with this undertaking is, the filling and tlie mainte-

nance of the Bitter Lakes with water. The area of the lalces has been stated to be

about 300 square miles ; but it is given by the French at five hundred millions of

square yards, which amounts to about loO square miles, or 100,000 acres. Now

the rate of evaporation of water in Egypt is about 1 inch per diem. Consider

how much this would be over an area of five hundred millions square yards. It

will, I believe, amouut to three himdred and sixty millions of cubic feet per diem,
which means something like two himdred and fifty thousand feet per minute. The
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS,  183

contents of the sectional area of the canal are between 6000 and 7O0O square
feet, and the amount required to supply the evaporation would require a velocity
in the canal of 40 feet per minute. Xow, as I have said, this water must come

from the Red Sea, which is depressed by the northerly winds prevailing during

--about nine mouths out of twelve, and is raised by the southerly winds, the varia-

tion being at times as much as 7 feet, ordinarily about 5 feet. The mean level

of the water in the canal can therefore only be maintained at a level below

that of the extreme depression of the Red Sea, in addition to the inclination

necessary for the flow of the water into the Bitter Lalces, to provide for the

evaporation.

    It this Association would endeavom* to obtain information in reference to all

the phenomena which may attend the filling of these great lakes from the Red Sea,
it would be doing considerable service to science. The enormous evaporation of

one inch per diem is equal to a rainfall of 365 inches per annum, and it cannot but
exercise some influence on the atmosphere of the smTounding district. This, I say,

ought to be carefully watched, and the most accurate observations ought to be

constantly made.

   I have now to approach a question which has excited a great amount of public
attention and discussion. It is a subject which ^vill come home to every man in

this country. I do not know how far my remarks may come into collision with
some of the papers which are to be read, but I offer them entirely on my own

authority. · I allude to the state of our Navy. I may begin by saying that, how-
ever satisfactory the general condition of our navy may be to the departments, it
must be admitted that in many essentials its condition is not satisfactory to the
country at large ; and I liope I may be enabled to point out to you in what way
pubhc opinion may be beueiicially brought to bear upon tliis important subject.
I feel certain I shall carry you all with me in saying that we in this country have
but one desire vnili regard to our navy, and that is, that, whatever may be the cost
to the nation, we should have the very best ships which the ocean can carry, and
which machinery can propel. I am speaking in the presence of men of great pro-
fessional skill and experience, men who have conducted ships through every sea
throughout the world, and among them I may mention the name of Admiral Sir
Edward Belcher. 1 think that he will agree with me in saying that the qualities of

a vessel in reference to her speed and steadiness ought to be thoroughly ascertained

before she is built. There is no merchant who builds a steamer for the con-
veyance of passengers or goods vv ho does not cler.rly lay down the object which
the ship is intended to accomplish, and who does not require that this .should be

considered by the )juilder. I say that the same rule ought to apply in the Royal

Navy, and that before any vessel of war is built her speed should be in the first

instance determined. And here I may .say that when I speak of speed, I do not
meau speed as talcen in the trials at Stolies Bay ; I refer to sea-going speed, which
depends upon many other qualities than those which a trial at Stokes Baj- can

possibly determine. The evolutions of a fleet, to be effective, must be conducted

with precision and certainty. This cannot be attained unless the speed of all
the ships of a squadron be nearly the same. Of course, you cannot obtain

exact uniformity, but you may approach it very nearly. But to have a fleet

in which some sliips will steam at the rate of 14 knots, some at the rate of
12 knots, and others at tlie rate of only 10 knots, is very much like en-

deavouring to get up a pack composed of all the dogs in a tov^ai, including tlie
swdftest greyhounds and the very commonest curs that can be met with. The

speed of a vessel ought to be the first element of consideration ; for it is useless to

carry guns which may sweep aiiother vessel out of the water if the ship carrying

those guns can only steam at the rate of 10 knots an hour, while the vessel she is
pursuing is enabled to go 14 knots. The next point is to utilize the speed.
I will not attempt to enter into the question of broadside and turret ships, but

I may sav that whatever may bo the difficulty in broadside ships of getting fine

lines for the head and stern, this difficulty ought not to exist in tm-ret vessels.
Having settled the battery, it ought to bo subject to as little disturbance as pos-
sible but the question of the relative utility of a gun, whether on a fixed platform or

                          ;

on a moveable one, is too obvious to need further comment. At present, however, it is
181 REPORT 1868.

unfortunately tlie case that -when we send a ship to sea we do not Iraow how much
she -svill roll. I am now speaking in the presence of gTeat mathematicians, and I

have no hesitation in saying that the laws which regulate the rolling of a ship are
as well known and determined as any laws upon which we act. Therefore I say
that the extent to which a ship will roll when sent to sea ought to he ascertained
before we are put to the expense of building a new ship at a cost of a quarter of a

million of money. I am, of coiu'se, aware that whatever may he the certainty

with which science may determine the conditions of the rolling of a ship, and the
degree of steadiness she may exhibit under canvas, another element will come in

which will defy mathematics, and that is, the different form and action of the

waves. Further than this, in specifying the conditions of the rolling of a ship,

niathematics will not determine what may be the exact motion of any particular
vessel. It cannot do this, but what it will do may be readily ascertained. For
instance, if we compare one vessel with another of the same class, knowing the
conditions of the two with regard to the distribution of weights and so on, we

shall be able to determine whether one particular ship will roll more than an-
other. If you have a vessel of 40 feet beam, or of 00 feet beam, she must be

compared with another vessel of the same breadth of beam. There can be no

doubt that any one seeing the 'Great Eastern' steaming down channel where there
was not sufficient sea to cause her to roll, would imagine her to be incapable of that

--action; but in reality when she is subject to the heavy swell of the Atlantic her

rolling is said to be " a caution " in fact she will roll in the Atlantic ©cean to an
extent that is almost intolerable. In short, what I mean is, that in all future ves-

sels their rolling should be fixed in reference to some standard vessel of a similar

class.

"\Miilst on this subject I may mention a circumstance which occruTed about two

months since, and which I admit did much astonish me. I was talking to a fi'iend

about the experiments then making at Shoeburyness, when a third gentleman

joined us, and the conversation turned upon ships. I expressed the opinion that it

was not creditable to the Admiralty that, in the construction of the Navy, ships

were sent to sea before it was known how much or bow little they woidd roll ; and

I referred to a statement, which appeared in the ' Times,' as to the discreditable

condition of the fleet during the cruize to Lisbon. The third gentleman I have

mentioned emphatically denied the correctness of the reports that had appeared,

in reference to the rolling of the ships ; and he added, " I have letters from the

captains of those vessels, stating that they were as firm as rocks, and that there

had not been any occasion when they could not dine in the cabins without requi-

ring any protection for the dishes." I then said, '' Do you mean to say that the

official statements which have appeared, and which have remained uncontradicted,

are untrue ?" The reply that I received was, " What I have stated is what I have

bad from the captains themselves." The gentleman who made this statement

having quitted us, I inquired who he was, and was surprised to learn that I had been

Nowlistening to ]\Ir. E. J. Eeed, the chief constructor of the Nav3^  if there are

in existence private documents entirely at variance with those furnished for the

information of Parliament and the public, either the Admiralty must be leaving the

public in the dark, or they must have been themselves deluded.

  Now next to stability in a vessel is sea-worthiness, and the ability of a ship to

go easily through a very heavy head sea depends very much on the disposition of the

weights near her head and stern. If you try the sailing qualities of two A'essels in

Asmooth water, you will probably find that vessel may go two knots an hour faster

Bthan vessel ; but if you take them out into a head sea, you may possibly find that
Bvessel goes two knots an hour faster than vessel A. Every time a vessel makes

a plunge into the sea the amount of power taken otit of her is immense ; and I

maintain that the trials of vessels which take place at Stokes Baj' are pure delu-

sions. The trials of all oiu- iron ships ought to take place at sea, and I think they

ought to be conducted by men of experience and of good scientific knowledge, who

are altogether independent of the Government or any other influence ; and until

this is done we shall not be able to appty that check to the constructive depart-
ment of the Admiralty which I think the country ought to exercise. The next

question with regard to ships is that of the amount of protection. In my opinion
                                                                                                                ;

                   TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                185

tlie question Avliether we sliould give more or less pi'otection to our A-essels by

means of armour plates must be subordinate to the purposes to which the ships

are to be applied as iioatiug- batteries. I say that you oug-ht, in the first place, to

obtain a fast sliip and one that will carry her battery so steadily as to make it most
useful and efFectiyc, and she ought to be able to go through a head sea ; then, sulj-
ordinate to these requisites, protect her as well as you cau. It is of no use to have

a ship so protected and overweighted that she becomes inefficient as a moveable

fort.

  Before concluding my remarks on shij)s I would say a few words on propulsion,

upon which subject there is a paper, and in reference to which Ur. Fairbairn has a

report to make. You must all be aware that within the last year or two a new
mode of propulsion by the emission of water has been introduced, and that the ex-

periment has cost the comitry about £40,000. It has been broadly asserted that

there are no means of obtaining- from that mode of jiropulsion more than 2o per
cent, of the power applied. I saj', therefore, that before experiments of this sort

are tried, the Government, or at all events this Association, ought to investigate

the subject in order to see whether the new mode be the most economical applica-
tion of power or the most wasteful that can be adopted. The matter is not to be
worked out by experiments with ships which only go eight knots an hour in smooth
water. Admiral Sir Edward Belcher assures me that the speed attained was ten
knots, and that she beat the other vessel against which she was tried ; to which I
would reply that she might easily accomplish that, as the other was one of the

worst designed ships in the Navy.

This leads me to another question in which we are all interested, and that is our
Wecoast defences.
                   have all been frightened for some years by the statement that

we may be attacked by an invading force, and that we are or have been peculiarly

open to the assaults of an enemy, aud therefore ought to take the best possible

measures for protecting our shores. The theory of this no one can deny, but the

mode in which the protection is to be afTorded is another thing. I happen to be-

long to a Volunteer Staii' Corps whose especial business it is to consider this question

and to advise the Government upon it. The tirst question we had to consider was

the defence of the east coast of England, and especially of the coast of this dis-

trict. It is obvious that there is no part of our coast which is so vidnerable as

this particidar division                                                                                        that there is no part of the country which oilers the same
                                                                                                             ;

Howinducements to an enemy to attack it as this district.                                                       this district is pro-

posed to be defended, and what are the operations to be undertaken in providing

for that defence, are matters of confidence between the corps I represent and Her

--Majesty's Government ; but I have the satisfaction of being- able to sav that

we have come to this conclusion that, easily as the coast in this district might

be attacked, it would by the adoption of judicious means be just as easily defended,

and this, too, without the erection of those ponderous forts which have been con-
structed on the southern coast. But it would have been expected that no sooner
were the Armstrong and the Whitworth gims invented, and the power and precision

·with which projectiles could be fired against any fort or vessel were understood,
than the authorities would have turned their serious attention to the question, and
would have applied the strictest scientific investigation to the new condition of
things. Indeed from the moment when the Armsti-ong- and Whitworth guns were

produced the days of embrasures were numbered. Any man who knows anvthing-
of the question wiU agree with me that he is safer in the open country than be-

hind an embrasure. In the open country he aflbrds but one small point of attack,

and the chances of his being hit are comparatively small, but beside a gun inside

the embrasure of a fort, if a shot strikes within that space he is subject to

casualty fi-om splinters. The introduction of the new mode of gunnery marked an

epoch at which the whole method of fortification should have l^een reconsidered

and if this had been done I feel sure that we shoidd not have had to regi-et the

construction of many large useless forts, not however including some of older date,
for the design of which it is impossible to discover who is responsible.

  A Commission has been instructed to report on the soundaiess of construction of

these forts ; I woidd venture to suggest that another Commission sliould be ap-

pointed to report on their military efficiency.
186 REPORT-- 1868.

   You liave all read tlie accounts cf the vast experiments tliat liave lately been
made in gunnery. I believe Dr. Fairbaim has been connected with those expe-

riments on the shields designed for tlie purpose of resisting the heaviest modern
artillery. I will not for a moment deny the ^alue of these experiments ; but I

must say that, in my opinion, they would have been more valuable if they had

been based on the well-known laws of the resistance of metals of the same
quality to impact due to weight and velocity. I think that improvement in the
structure of guns would have been advanced with more certainty if the action
of gunpowder upon the projectile had been clearIj^ ascertained and detined. It
is perfectly certain that gimpowder when exploded cannot act with less power
than sixty tons upon the square inch ; it is also certain that unless that power

be immediately reduced we have no gun which it will not destroy ; but the fact
is that the moment the projectile myves, the enormous expansion of the pow-

der is reduced with such rapiditj' that the metal has not time to yield and break
before the pressure is removed and the danger is gone. This shows that the
kind of metal you use, whatever its tenacitj- and hardness, should be capable
of yielding to a certain extent, without absolntely breaking ; but it is quite cer-
tain that this sort of action is of such a nature that if it be continued to a cer-
tain extent it must lead to the destruction of the gun, and that the question

as to the life of a gim is only one of how many charges may be tired from it before

it is absolutely destroyed. I say that the whole question of the mechanical action
of the gunpowder gases should be absolutely determined and settled, and that it

ought to be clearly understood b}' those who are engaged in designing guns. If

they go on without this knowledge they are merely proceeding at " hap-hazard,"
and are groping in the dark.

   The improvement of the communication between England and the Continent is
now daily exciting more and more attention. Admirably as the service is con-
ducted, imder existing circumstances, still the horroi s and delaj-s of the middle

passage, across the Straits of Dover, will, so long as they continue, restrict free
intercourse with the Continent. Indeed, until a traveller can reach his destination,
at Paris or Brussels, in the same carriage in v,-hich he started from London, this
great desideratum cannot be said to have been attained.

 --There are now two projects, more or less, before the public, one for bridging the

Channel, and the other for tunnelling beneath it. Before analyzing these projects
I would make one general observation, viz. that any jjroject involving an outla}'
(inclusive of interest during progress) of from forty to iifty millions sterling, and
requiring from forty to hfty years for its execution, cannot with reason he enter-

tained.

   With regard to the Bridge project, the latest proposition would appear to be to

span the channel by a viaduct consisting of openings of three thousand feet each.

The platform must of necessity be upwards of two hundred feet above the level of
the sea. The piers woidd be erected on islets founded in a depth of water of thirty
fathoms. Now, bearing in mind that to bridge the Thames in the most economical
manner involves a cost of about £"12o per lineal foot, and applying this as a stand-
ard, contrasting the facilities in the one case with the obvious enormous dilficidties
and contingencies in the other, the relative cost of the latter must greatly exceed
four times that of the former ; the minimum cost, therefore, of the channel -s'iaduet
cannot be taken at less than £-500 per lineal foot, which at once brings the cost up
to fifty millions sterling, without taking into account cmTent interest. With these
remai'ks we may dismiss the Bridge question.

  A recent article in the 'Times ' describes the Tunnel project: the main tunnel

is to be constructed at such a depth below the bottom of the channel as, it is hoped,
would enable a stratum to be reached which would be impervious to infiltration.
Nevertheless there is sonre uncertainty on this point. It is proposed to commence
by driving a trial heading at a cost of two millions sterling. The estimated cost
of the main tunnel was stated at, I believe, eight millions, raiding the total esti-
mated cost to ten millions. Without going into all the details of construction, I

--will only allude to the two main features the driving of the heading, and the

completion of the maui tunnel.

   It is obvious that the heading can only be driven from the two ends ; and as-
                                         TRANSACTIONS OF THK SECTIONS.                                                                       187

Buniiug that the stratum is foimd to be so favouraLle as to admit of an imiuter-

riipted dail}' progress of two to three yards being made at each face (a rate of pro-

gress which is beyond my experience), twenty years will be absorbed iu this trial

only, and the two millions to be expended will become nearly three millions, by the
addition of interest. Assuming the trial heading to be completed, and that ar-
rangements had been made for working the main tunnel from as many as ten faces

(four intermediate points and the two ends), and assuming the same absence of

contingencies and an unbroken period of peace, a progress of 20 yards per week is

the greatest that can be anticipated ; but for the purpose of my argument I will

assume the progress to be 30 lineal j-ards per week. Upon this basis an additional
period of twenty-five j^ears will be required to complete the main tunnel. By that

time the three millions expended in forniiug the heading will, by the addition of

interest, have reached the sum of seven millions, and the eight millions spent in the

main timnel will, for the same reason, have become twelve millions : thus, without

taking into account innumerable unforeseen contingencies necessarily attendant on

such a work, the outlay mav be taken at twent}^ millions sterling, and the time

occupied at not less than forty-five years. The carrying on Ihe tunnel works at four

intermerliate points through a heading of sucli enormous length is clearly imprac-

ticable                                  three or four shafts in mid-channel would therefore become  essential.                              Let
                                      ;

us consider what the construction of a shaft in mid-channel would involve. It has

to be founded in water of the depth of 30 fathoms, then to perforate a water-bearing

stratum of uncertain thickness ; then let us see what work this shaft has to do.
From tlie verj^ nature of the locality (a sea much vexed b}' storms) there must

be a barrack for the workmen, space for the materials of construction, and a pier

for shelter and for discharging the vessels laden with stores and materials. I

must therefore confess that, to my mind, although such a work cannot be assumed

to be mechanically impossible, it woidd appear to be commercially and nationally

myinfeasilile. If                        views are correct, this great international problem still remains

for solution.

   There is one other subject to which I will allude, and in the presence of so

distinguished a man as Mr. Siemens, who has attained so eminent a position as an
electrician, and who is now, I am happy to say, engaged in the completion of

the Indo-European Telegraph, while he is at the same time appljdng his great

powers to oiher subjects, I could hardly close my remarks without saying a few

words  on electricity,                   with which he  has  for many years been  connected                                                  and it is
                                                                                                                                          ;

more especiallj^ interesting, as the Electric Telegraph was first practically applied

by the late Mr. Robert Stejihenson and myself to working the single line of rail-

way, as originally constructed, between this city (Norwich) and Yarmouth, and

about the same time it was adapted, at our suggestion, to working the stationary
engine system on the Blackwall Railway. The experience derived from these

adaptations induced me, at a later period, to originate couuuercial telegraphy, by

question vrhicli has been greatly agitated in this country is that of the telegraph

to the East, which is undoubtedly an undertaking of extreme utility. There is

a company seeking to continue the telegraph to and tlirough Egypt by way of
the Red I'^ea, and they urge the great advantage it would be in making us more

independent of foreign influences ; but a chain is always estimated by the strength

of its weakest link, and there is one weak link in this proposed telegraphic chain,

and that is the passage through Egypt. This latter point demands grave conside-

Aration.                                 telegraphic line established via Gibraltar, the Cape of Good Hope, and

Ceylon woidd be 3000 miles longer than the direct route, and would no doubt cost

a considerable additional sum ; but if such a line were established, the only poten-

tate with whom we should have to contend for possession of that telegi-aph would

be Old Neptune. I wish our friend every success in the operation he is carrying on,
but I should be better pleased to see his name associated with the successful com-

ple(ion of an integral line of telegraph to India.

   There is another subject to which I would refer, and that is the question of tech-

nical education. I think that education of this ];ind ought to be directed more

especially to the branch which the student intends to pursue in after life. You

would not give the same education to the engineer that you woidd give to the
--188 REPORT 1868.

artist or to the agriculturist ; but all teclmical education should he accoDipanied by
a sound knowledge of the elementary laws of mechanics. Indeed I would have this
knowledge instilled into the mind of tlie student over and over again until it
became almost a part of his nature ; and I make this observation on an experience
of five and forty years. I have known some of our greatest engineers and most
eminent philosophers make the most discreditable errors tlirough not having been
thorougl)^ acquainted with the elementary laws of mechanics, which, 1 repeat,
ought to form the basis of all technical education *. Before any engineer would
entrust a yoimg man, however well educated, with any -n'ork of the smallest im-
portance, he would require that he should have had some practical acquaintance
with the branch to which that work belongs. I think, also, that the theory on
which the technical education of the Royal Engineers is conducted ought to be
modified, and that they ought to have a certain amount of practical apprenticeship
in the great operations they have to carry on ; as, for instance, in the construction

of forts, and especially before taking charge of gun and other factories. I am well
aware that IMr. Whitworth, who has made such a ])rincely endowment for tech-

nical education, feels strongly on this point, and he has expressed his conviction
that if this principle were adopted vastly greater economy and eiKciency for the
public service would be attained.

   Looking at the achievements of Sir William Armstrong and Mr. Whitworth in
revolutionizing the construction of artillerj^, we have an example of what can be
effected by the concentration of the minds of accomplished mechanicians upon

special subjects.

   In conclusion I may say that, beyond all these things, we should never lose sight

--of that pursuit to which a powerful Commission has directed its attention I refer

to the application of machinery to the economical working and ventilation of
mines ; and this being accomplished, the economic use of the products of those
mines ought next to engage attention, whether as applied to the worlring of our

manufactories and the turning of our spindles, to cheering the poor man in his

humble home, or to propeUiug through the water those ironclads which represent

the might and genius of this great covmlry-- the might they may represent, the

genius they caricature.

Let us see what amount of power would be requisite to propel a balloon capable of sup-

porting the weiglit of one person only.

For this purpose I will assume a perfectly calm atniosjihere, also that a gas can be obtained

with sufBcient tension, but without weight, and tliat the balloon can be made of a material

so light that its weight may also be omitted from the calculation.

With these favourable and impracticable conditions, it would require a balloon of Ifi feet

diameter to support the weiglit of a man in our atuiosjjliere.

To propel this at the sjieed of 20 miles per hour (about one-h.alf of that of an express

train) would reqinre an engine of at least five horse-power.

   It may, however, be said that a spherical form is not the best adapted for displacing the

--air; on the other hand, I would observe that tliis only liolds in dead calms that when

the course of the balloon is across the current of the atmosphere the resistance would be

increased in a much greater ratio.

                   On London Sreet Tramways. By H. Bright.

   The author said the London omnibuses were notoriously mismanaged ; and when
it was remembered that there were 600 of these vehicles in London, each capable
of carrying, on an average, twenty-three passengers, the question became an im-

portant one. There coiild he little doubt that a judicious system of street tram-
ways, or horse railways, would supply a great and rapidly growing demand, which
could not be met by steam locomotion on the ordinary railway, where the trains

could not work like' omnibuses, taking up passengers at every moment when re-
quired, but must run through from station to station. Street tramways had proved
a success wherever they had been judiciously tried, andwould doubtless yield an
enormous profit if laid down in Loudon and other large towns. They were ex-
tensively used in America and Canada, and had been adopted at Copenhagen and
the subiu-bs of Paris ; while it was proposed to apply them to Berlin, Brussels, and
Vienna. The objection which might be urged against the interference of tramways
with the ordinary traffic would be met by taking the many good and available

lines afforded by back streets, taking care to bring the line at certain points into
close proximitj' to the main traffic. The system he proposed to adopt was some-
what similar to that which was at present in use in Manchester and Geneva, the
vehicle being kept on the track by means of a wheel, which the driver could at plea-
sure drop into or lift up from a grooved rail in the centre of the track. The forma-
tion of the lines for the carriage-wheels was peculiar, there being a slope with a

depression of only one inch for each wheel, which would be so made as to fit the

wheel-ways, while the depression will be so slight that it could not obstruct the

progress of any ordinary vehicle. The vehicle would be enabled to turn the
sharpest curves, and would carry forty-eight passengers, exclusive of the driver
and conductor. It was proposed, by an efficient system of breaks, with a carefully
devised scheme of compensation for the horses, to enable the driver to stop the

vehicle at any moment.

                               By Latimer Clark, C.E.

   This was in continuation of a paper on the same subject last year. The writer
showed that there were many different gauges now in use, and that it had become
almost a usual thing for each manufacturer to set up his own gauge. The evils of
this system were obvious, and were much felt by wire-drawers, as well as by en-
gineers. If a gauge were authorized by the British Association, he beheved it
would be universally adopted by engineers, manufacturers, and wire-drawers.
The gauge proposed by the writer differed very little from that now in use, and
known as the Birmingham gauge ; and he suggested that the question was one
upon which the Association might appoint a Committee.

0)1 the Unsatisfactory Character of Coroners' Inquests consequent on Steam-

                 Boiler Explosions. By Latington E. Fletchek.

  It appears that since tlie coiiimencemeut of 1835 up to the 31st of May last there
occurred in difl'erent parts of the kingdom as many as 4G4 explosions, hy which

789 persons were hilled and 924 injured; and these are not all, as in the earlier

years the records are not complete. It may be stated, in roiuid numbers, that

about fifty steam-boiler explosions occur on an average every year, resulting in the

loss of seventy lives. In the author's opinion, derived from a very extended expe-

rience, whatever may be the precise circumstances of each ease, the cause of every

one may be given in one word, viz. nei/Jed, while the simple preventive is care.
The author proceeded to say, let every coroner be empowered and instructed, when

holding an inquirj^ on a boiler explosion, to call in two competent and perfectly

independent scientific engineers to investigate the cause of the explosion, and re-

port to the jui-y. These engineers should visit the scene of the explosion, examine

the fragments of the boiler, attend to the inquest, hear the evidence given by

parties concerned in the charge of the boiler, and aid the coroner in conducting the

inquiry ; while, in addition, they should report to him, either jointly or severally,

on the cause of the ex]3losion, and accompany their report with suitable sealed

drawings of the exploded boiler, showing its original construction and the lines of

fracture as well as the flight of the parts, as far as they can be ascertained. The

inquest to be open to the public, under the control of the coroner, and also to the

press, both scientific and general, so that the entire proceedings may have as wide

Aa circulation as possible.  full account of the inquiry, including the engineers'

reports, accompanied with the sealed drawings to be printed and deposited at the

Patent Office, and to be accessible to both the purchase and inspection of the

public, as is at present the case with the specification of patents. Also a report of

each inquiry to be sent to the members of both Houses of Parliament as issued.

Such a course, he thought, woidd stimulate coroners to make searching and full

investigations ; and if at the outset incompetent engineers were selected by the

coroner, the publicity given to their proceedings, as recommended above, would

bring them under the criticism of the press and general engineering public, which

it is thoiight might be relied on as a corrective. If full investigations were

brought to bear upon boiler explosions, and those persons who produce them by

working old worn-out boilers were fairh' brought to the bar of public opinion,

and compelled, when necessary, to compensate the widow and orphan for the

results of their negligence, the mystery of boiler explosions would soon be dispelled,

and their occurrence put a stop to. He cousiderd this plan superior to any govern-

ment inspection, which led to the fettering of trade and destroyed responsibilitJ^

On the Irrigation of Upper Lomharch/ by Xeiv Canals to he derived from the

      Lakes Lugano and Maggiore. By P. Le Neve Foster, Jim., C.E.

   The author, after referring to the high pitch of perfection to which irrigation in
Lonibardy has been carried, pointed out that, although the lower part of Lombardy
is well watered by existing canals, the whole tract of country to the north of Milan,
extending to the foot of the hills of Tarese and the Brianza, is too high to be
watered by them, and is almost unirrigated. The author then described the tech-
nical details of a scheme undertaken Ijy Signori Villoresi and Meraviglia, by which
it is proposed to irrigate the higher lands by canals from the Lake Lugano and
the lower lands by canals from Lago Maggiore, this Ijake being situated at too low
a level to water the whole region, while the supply from Lugano is not more than
sufficient to water half the whole district. Permission has lieen obtained from the
Swiss Government to store up the flood-waters of Lugano, and regulate their dis-
charge for use in droughts. The same system will be adopted in reference to Lago
Maggiore, and works for this purpose, consisting of dams, gates, and locks, will be

--erected in connexion with both lakes. The waters will be distributed by principal

canals five in number, secondary canals, communal canals, and private canals.
The total number of the works to be constructed, such as locks (of which there
will be forty-seven), bridges, aqueducts, siphons, &c., will be about 260, and the

canals are estimated to supply 8000 horse-power for mills &c., and to irrigate and
thus improve the agriculture of 400 comnumes. The cost is estimated at two mil-
lions and a quarter sterling. One of the most remarkable features of the scheme is
the manner in which it is proposed to raise the capital : Consordi. or societies of
consumers of water, are to he promoted by the local authorities. In this manner, the
provinces, communes, and other corporate bodies bind themselves to take a certain

quantity of water, either by payment of a fixed sum down or by annual payments,
which payments they are able to guarantee from the receipts they will derive from

the sale of the water to the various consumers, or, if necessary,' from their other

som-ces of revenue, and the capital is raised on bonds issued on this basis. The
concession is granted for ninety years, after which the works become the property
of the State. The works will probably be commenced in the course of the autumn.

Description of a Ventilatim/ Fireplace, with Experiments upon its Heating

     O.B., F.R.S.

   By means of A^ery simple arrangements, described by the author, but which are

unintelligible without diagrams, the rooms are heated by an open fireplace of an
 ordinary character, whilst the heat which would otherwise be lost in passing up
the chimney is utilized in warming a current of fresh air from without, brouo-ht

in for the supply of the room. The author stated that it was now laro-ely used°iu

health and comfort of the troops. Upwards of 5000 had been erected in various
places, and were now in use, and it was no longer an experiment. The stove
was not expensive, and the arrangements could be adapted to existing buildino's.

  The Broads of East Norfollc, having reference to the Water-supply, Stowage,
                         and Drainage. Bij E. B. Grantham, C.E.

   The author commenced by alluding to the derivation of the word " Broad " from
the Anglo-Saxon Bradan or Bradene, meaning to make broad. Breydon AVater, near
Yarmouth, has undoubtedly the same derivation. As Inspector of Drainao'es under
the Land-Drainage Act, he had visited the neighbourhood to report upon some
applications for drainage, and while there he was struck by the existence of such
large and singular bodies of water, of which he could fiiid no similar instance

except on the opposite coast of Holland.

   The particidar object of the paper was to point out the uses to which these
" Broads " might be put as a means of water-supply and storage to towns and
villages, and also to show that the improvement of the surrounding land mio-ht be
eflected by combined drainage systems. The supply of water to Yarmouth from
Ormesby, Rollesby, and Filby Broads (about 500 acres) was referred to as an
instance of water-supply, and the improvements cari'ied out at Martham, Somerton
and Wintertou, and Beccles were mentioned as cases of combined drainage

systems.

 " Geologically considered, this part of Norfolk consists of posttertiarv, alluvial,

lacustrine, and estuarine deposits, contorted sand-beds. Upper and Lower Boulder-
clays, laminated beds of clay resting on Norwich Crag, which lies partly upon the
Clialk, which is about 400 feet thick, and dips towards the south-east, and partly
upon the London Clay. The waters conforming to the slope of the Chalk are dis-
charged into the sea at Yarmouth. The collection of the Museum at Norwich

contains the characteristic fossils of the different formations.

   According to history, it was shown that the sea at one time ilowed up to Nor-
wich, and enabled ships to sail up there.

 ^The author then proceeded to describe tlie general character of the valleys of the
Y'"are, the Bure, and the Waveuey, giving their respective areas ; the Yare con-
taining 533, Bure 338, Waveney 339 square miles, making a total of 1210 square

miles.

  He then explained what he conceived to be the origin of the "Broads.". The

sea receding from these valleys left wide channels in the low parts of the country
which became receptacles for the drainage. The growth and decay of vegetation
and the detritus brought down by the streams gradual^ narrowed the channels,
and confined them to the present course of the rivers. Large spaces were, how-

ever, left occupied hj the water, which are now termed " Broads." They are

thirty in number, and vary ui size from 578 to llf acres.
   The mean rainfall in the country for seven years is 24'41 inches.
   The depths of the " Broads " were stated as varying considerablj'. Some of the

bottoms of them are on a level with the sea at low water at Yarmouth.
   All the " Broads " are supplied by the streams from the minor valleys and by

spi'ings, and there is no doubt that they are of great service in times of flood,

when they store up the flood-waters and prevent them from overflo^ving· the lands
below; and it is in the capacity of reservoirs that all these "Broads" might be
made most useful.

   With regard to the drainage, the author was of opinion that the marshes which
surround them might be treated in a similar manner to those at Winterton and at
Hemesby. The injurious eftects of marshes upon health are well known, and he
therefore thought the reclamation would remove the cause.

           On some Points affecting the Economical Manufacture of Iron,
                                   By John Jones, F.G.S.

   The author estimated tlie production of pig iron in Great Britain at 4,500,000
tons per annum, and the make of finished iron at about .3,000,000 tons. The author
adduced these statistics to show the immense issues involved in the improvements
he wished to notice. The author then referred to the economical application of
fuel in the iron-manufacture, more particularly in the finislied iron processes, and
remarked that the newer blast-fui'nace plant left little to be accomplished in the

economical use of fuel, except in utilizing the waste products given off in coking
the fuel. In puddling, however, gi'eat waste of fuel went on, and two modifica-
tions of the ordinary puddling-furnace were to be noticed as calculated to save
from 20 to 2o per cent, of fuel, and to consume all the smoke usually produced.

The Wilson furnace, in its most recently improved form, consisted of a sloping
chamber, into which the fuel was fed at the top ; and the volatile matters gene-
rally forming smoke were reduced by passing over the incandescent mass of fuel
further along the chamber. The air for combustion was delivered into the furnace
in a heated condition, and a steam-jet was delivered underneath the grate, by
means of which the formation of clinkers was avoided. The Newport furnace,
Middlesborough, had a chamber constructed in the ordinary chimney-stack ; and
in this were placed a couple of cast-iron pipes, with a partition reaching nearly to
the top. These pipes were heated by the waste gases from the puddling-furnace,
and through them the air required for combustion was forced by means of a steam-
jet, and was thus delivered in front of the grate in a highly heated condition.
These furnaces, of which a considerable number were in operation at the Newport
works, effected a saving of at least 2.5 per cent, in fuel. The structural modifica-
tions would invoh-e comparatively little outlay, and the saving to be effected would
recoup that outlay in a single year. Tlie economy represented by applying the
new plans to the whole iron trade would amount to about 1, 500,000 tons of coal
per annum. The author next proceeded to describe the mantifacture of iron by
what is termed the Eadcliffe process, which had been for some time in operation at
the Consett Ironworks, Newcastle. The puddled iron, which was usually rolled
into rough bars, straightened and weighed, allowed to get cool, then cut up, piled,

heated, rolled into blooms, reheated, and, finally, rolled into finished iron, after a

complicated series of operations, was, by the new method, finished off' by a con-

tinuous and simple process. Five or more puddled balls were put together into a

large bloom, under a very heavy steam-hammer, shingled down into a bloom,

passed for a short time through a heating-furnace, and rolled oft' into finished iron

not more than half an hour after the iron left the pudtUing-fumace. Specimens of
Airon made by the process were exhibited.
                                           great saving in the cost of manufac-

ture was represented by this process in all departments of the manufacture of

finished iron ; and it was calculated that a saving of 1,500,000 tons of coal alone

woidd result from the general application of this system. Particular stress was

laid upon the fact that, in carrying out this process, no extensive or expensive

alteration of existing works was requu-ed, and a saving of from 3^ to 4 c\vt. of

puddled iron would be secured upon each ton of finished rails or plates now turned

out, the cost of making malleable iron being reduced to a very considerable extent.

The importance of the whole question, in a national point of view, was also dwelt

upon.

      On the recent Progress of Steel Manufacture. By Fekdinand Xohn.

    The author had, at the previous Meeting at Dundee, drawn attention to a pro-
 cess of manufactming steel upon the open hearth of a Siemens's furnace by the

--mutual reaction of pig iron and wi-ought iron upon each other a process which

 had at that time commenced to gain groimd upon the Continent, but had not been
 brought into conmiercial practice in this country. This process, which had been
named the Martin process by its inventors, Messrs. E. and P. Martin, in Paris,

should, in justice to both the inventors to whom its success was due, obtain the

name Siemens-Martin process.

    The Siemens-Martin process had within this last year been brought into opera-
tion in this country at the Newport Steel AVorks, in Middleborough-on-Tees, be-
longing to the well-known firm of Messrs. Samuelson and Co. ; and it had been
worked with great regidarity and with very satisfactory results, employing in a
very considerable proportion the puddled iron from the Cleveland district as the
raw material. The Siemens-Martin process realized the old idea of melting

wi-ought U'on in a bath of liquid pig iron, and thereby converting the whole mass
into steel. The principal elements of its successfid operation, and the points which
distinguish it from all previous unsuccessful attempts, are the high tempera-
ture and the neutral or non-oxidizing flame of the regenerative gas-furnace, and
the method of charging the decarburized iron into the bath of pig iron in mea-
sured quantities, which are added at regular intervals, so that each followino-

chai'ge in melting or being dissolved increases the quantity and the dissolviuo-

power of the bath until the stage of complete decarburization is arrived at. The
operation is then completed by the addition of pig iron containing manganese;
and by regulating the quantity of that addition, any desired degree of hardness
could be obtained with certainty. The prime cost of the Siemens-Martin steel did
not exceed that of Bessemer steel, made from hematite iron in this country. The
author did not apprehend any danger for the Bessemer process from the competi-
tion of this new mode of steel manufacture, which, working with different raw
materials, could only assist and stimulate the Bessemer process and the spread of

steel manufactm'e in general.

On the Abrading and Transjiorting Power of Water. By T. Login, F.B.S.E.

On the Necessity for further Experimental Knowledge respecting the Projnilsion
                  of Shij)s. By Charles "W. Meeeifield, F.B^S.

The author began with a short review of what was already known on the sub-

ject of the law of the resistance to which a ship was subjected by its having to

force its way through the water. The author showed that although there was a

general consent that the resistance varied, with a certain degree of approximation,

according to the law of the square of the velocity, yet there was abundant proof

that that law was inexact, and that the nature and causes of this discrepancy,

although much discussed, were still in need of experimental determination. lie

considered that the first requisite -was to liave the direction and velocity of the

cuiTents of water which accompany a ship's motion determined by actual observa-

tion. For this purpose he submitted to the Section a rough scheme of experi-

ments, which, liowever, he wanted to get corrected by the experience of a Com-

mittee of the Association. He suggested that a vessel of the corvette class should

' (at separate times) be towed, and also driven by her own screw, instrmuents

being used to measure both the power employed, the speed of the vessel, and the

velocity and direction of the accompanying water, at various rates of speed. He

pointed out serious difficidties in ascertaining the direction of the cm-rents of

water, and was unable to suggest for this purpose anything better than direct

vision. The author exhibited certain instruments for assisting the eye in looking

--through the distm-bed surface, one of them being a common water-glass, a simple

trumpet with a sheet of plate glass at the bottom, which was dipped below the

water, the other beiug Arago's scopeloscope. He also described an electrical log,

patented by M. Anfonso, of jMende. But he thought all these things required

further consideration. He proposed to apply for a Committee of the Association

to discuss the subject, with a view of considering what experiments might best be

made                               and if  the Committee  were of  opinion  that  satisfactory results  might  be
                                ;

expected fi-om such experiments, then to memorialize the Admiralty to detail

vessels and officers for the purpose of carrying them out in the course of the

summer.

0)1 Dynamite, a recent Preparation of Nitro-r/li/cerine, as a Blasting Ar/ent.

                                                          B)j A. Nobel.

The author stated that by mixiug nitro-glyceriue and powdered silica in the

proportions of 75 per cent, of the former to 2-5 per cent, of the latter, a substance

was obtained which, wliile it retained all the valuable properties of nitro-glycerine

for blasting, was no longer dangerous, inasmuch as it could be handled freely, and

did not explode by fire alone, or when accidentally subjected to percussion. He

Ainstanced experiments lately made at Glasgow and Merstham.                       box containing

about 8 lbs. of dynamite (equal in power to 80 lbs. of gunpowder) was placed over

a fire, where it slowly burned awaj' ; and another box -ndth the same quantity

was hurled from a height of more than (30 feet on the rock below, uo explosion

ensuing from the concussion sustained. It appeared that the explosion when required

was produced by means of a percussion-cap, which acted both by percussion and

by fire, the combination of the two producing the effect, whilst neither alone was

efiective. The value of the material as a blasting agent appeared to be very gTeat;

and if it be as safe as the author believes, it cannot fail to be of great assistance

both to the engineer and the miner.

On a Probable Connexion between the Resistance ofS7iips and tlieir Mean Depth
   of Immersion. By Prof. "W. J. Macqtjoen EaisTiine, O.E., LL.D., F.R.S.

   The author, after referring to previous researches of his own and of Mr. Scott
Russell in relation to waves, stated that the object of his paper was to call the

attention of the British Association, and especially of the Committee on steam-
ship performance, to the probable existence of an element in the resistance of
ships hitherto neglected, viz. that every ship is accompanied by waves whose
natural speed depends on the virtual depth to which she disturbs the water*, and
that consequently, when the speed of a ship exceeds that natural speed, there is
probably an additional term in the resistance depending on such excess. The
author suggests that suitable observations and calculations should be made in
order to discover its amount and its laws, .(\juongst observations which would be
serviceable for that pui-pose might be mentioned the measurement of the angles of
divergence^ of the wave-ridges raised by various vessels at given speeds, and the
determination of the figure of those ridges, which were well known to be curved;
and amongst the results of calculation the mean depth of immersion as found by
dividing the volume of displacement by the ai-ea of the plane of floatation; and that

not only for the whole ship, hut for her fore and after bodies separately, it being-
probable that the virtual depth of uniform distiu'bance, if not equal to the mean
depth of inunersion, is conufctod with it by some definite relation. In an appen-
dix the author gave the results of three observations he had been able to make
and, few as they had been, he thought they were sufficient to prove the existence
of waves whose speed of advance depended on the depth to which the vessels
disturbed the water. The connexion between these waves and the resistance re-
mained for future investigation.

constructed that they will be capable of maintaining their grip upon curves of 20-
feet radius, thereby giving the vehicles the power of turning corners with the
greatest facility, the inventor thinks his principle peculiarly adapted to locomotion
through new countries, and for passing through ravines, or up and down the sides

of mountains, up any gradient not exceeding 1 in 12. He proposed to propel the

carriages by steam-traction engines, although they might also be drawn by horses
or other beasts of burden. The adhesion of the traction- wheels coidd be regidated
to any weight, and by the application of a special apparatus the engine might be
made to lift the traction-wheels out of a soft place. The cost of the new railway

he estimated at about £500/. per mile.

          On the Proper Form of Projectiles for Penetration under Water,
                         By Joseph Whitwokth, LL.D., F.Ii.S.

   The author exhibited a photograph showing the actual effect produced on an
iron plate in an experiment made by him -^ith three descriptions of projectiles.
The iron plate shown in the photograph is 50 in. long, 13 wide, 1'2 in. thick, and
was inmiersed in water 39 in. deep. The gun used was the 1-pounder, from which
all the former experiments were made previous to the first penetration of 4-in.
armour from his 70-pounder rided gun in October 18-38. The angle of depression
of the gim was 7° 7", the distance which the projectile passed through the water from
the point of entering it to the bull's-eye is 80 inches. No. 1 projectile is Whitworth
steel, and of the flat-headed form always advocated by the author for use at sea. The
photograph showed that it was not deflected by passing through the water. No. 2
shot, with hemispherical form of head, was deflected, and struck O^ in. above the
bull's-eye. No. 3 projectile is of white cast iron, commonly called the Palliser, or
chilled shot, and it struck 19 in. above the bidl's-eye, its conical form of head causing
it to rise quickly out of the water. The advantages of No. 1 projectile are, first, its
power of penetration when fired even at extreme angles against armour plates

secondly, its large internal capacity as a shell; thirdly, the capability of passing

through water and of penetrating armour below the water line. The No. 3 projectile
is advocated by Major Palliser, on account of its cheapness and its power of penetra-
tion, which latter quality, however, depends upon its being fired at a near approach
to right angles against armour plates ; its adoption is also supported by the Director

of Ordnance (at the War Office) and the President of the Ordnance Select Committee.

The author regretted that he had for so many 3-ear3 been so frequently obliged to differ

in opinion on mechanical subjects with these gentlemen. His objections to this pro-

jectile are, first, that when it is fired at any considerable angle against an armour

plate its form induces it to glance off, and the brittleness of the metal causes it to
break up ; and it is to be observed that in naval actions oblique fire is the ride, and
direct fire is the rare exception ; second, that the brittleness and consequent weak-

ness of the metal necessitate a greater thickness of the sides, and reduce its internal

                                                                                                    13*

capacity as a shell ; and, third, that its form renders it useless for penetration under
water. If the First Lord of the Admiralty would have a few roimds tired at sea
from the Whitworth 7-iu. gun and the Woolwich 7-in gun, with each kind of
projectile, at a range of, say, 500 yards, and at various angles, against an armour
plate fixed on the side of an old ship, the result would show which description of
projectile was the best adapted for the service. This power of penetration under
water, with the flat-fronted projectile, was first brought by Mr. Whitworth under

the notice of the War Office and the Admiralty in 1857, simultaneously with the
introduction of armour plating ; and, by desire of the late Lord ilardinge, who

was then Commander-in-Chief, a 24-pounder howitzer was rifled and was sent,
with some projectiles, for trial to Portsmouth. The experiment was perfectly
successful. Capt. Hewlett, of the ship ' Excellent,' says, in his report to the Admi-
ralty, January 2oth, 1858, " The penetration into wood at this depth under water

has, I believe, never before been obtained." In 1864 the matter was brought be-
fore the Armstrong and Whitworth Committee, and an experiment was made from

On Patent Monopoly as affecting the Encouragement, Improvement, and Pro-

  gress of Science, Arts, and Manufactures. By Henbx Diecks, C.E,,

    LL.D., Sfc.

   The object of this paper was to show that patent monopoly had for centiu'ies
been conceded to inventors, but that up to the early part of the eighteenth centmy
inventors were not bound to describe any particular kind of machine or process,
and that the tirst descriptive specification dates no earlier than 3rd October, 1711.
Especial notice was taken of the abuses of the system during the reign of Queen

Elizabeth, and the successive improvements in Patent Law from the accession of

James I. to the present time. As inventors can have no protection beyond a
patented or a secret process, it is shown that secret inventions are a truer monopoly

than patent right aifords, while at the same time secrets are open to the practice of
every species of deception. Tables were exhibited of Patent Inventions chrono-
logically arranged, fioni March 1617 (14 James I.) to October 1852, when the first
great improvement took place in reducing patent fees to at least one-third of their
xisual previous cost ; and reign by reign patent progress bore no comparison with
what is made in that of the present reign. There were only 4 patents per annum
during the reign of James I., 02 per annum in that of George III., and not above

297 per annum up to 185.3, or twenty-three years of Victoria, whereas they now
rate at .3000 per annum. By other tables was shown tha number of patents from

the eighteenth to the nineteenth century obtained by various eminent patentees,
all contributing to show tlie decided advantages reaped by arts, science, and manu-
factm-us through improved liberal patent laws.
