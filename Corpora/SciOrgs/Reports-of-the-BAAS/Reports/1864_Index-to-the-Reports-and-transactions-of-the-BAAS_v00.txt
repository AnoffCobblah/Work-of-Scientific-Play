                         NOTICE.

    The Index, now completed, to the Reports and Transactions of the British
     Association for the Advancement of Science from the beginning of its labours
    in 1831 to 1860, was projected by Professor Phillips while holding the office
    of Assistant General Secretary. He had hoped, by the cooperation of his
    friend Mr. Griffith, and the aid of Mr. William Askham, who had been
    engaged in many ways as an able and zealous assistant at the annual meet
    ings and in the printing of the volumes, to have been able to see this work
    finished before retiring from office. By the regretted death of Mr. Askham
     an unexpected delay occurred, and a larger share of personal labour has
     fallen on the present Assistant General Secretary.

        The Proceedings of the Association, except those of the first Meeting, are
    printed in two portions ; the first consisting of Reports and Researches in
     Science, which have been drawn up by request of the General Committee,
     and a larger number of Communications offered to the several Sections com
    posing each Meeting. For each of these portions an Index has been pre
    pared and printed in the Annual Volumes.

^- The present work is not merely a collection of these separate elements
 - into one Catalogue ; it was intended to bear the character of a revised and
    arranged Table of Reference, assigning to each Author his share of the work,

 

     to each Place the descriptive passages, and to each Subject the principal

   notices relating to it. It was thought desirable to continue the plan of

     separate reference to Reports and Sectional Proceedings,' and to con
     struct for each of these parts, separate registers of Authors,' Places,' and

    Subjects.' In cases where Reports were drawn up by Committees appointed

.. by the Association, all the Members of the Committee have usually been
     quoted as Authors, though in some instances only one signature annexed,

v and in others, as in the Report on Zoological Nomenclature, the principal

~ features of plan and execution were impressed by one mind firmly directed
     to every part of the subject.
