REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.

Report of the GouncAl for the year 1881-82, presented to tlio General
          Committee at Southamjjton, on Wednesday, August 23, 1882.

     Tlie Council have received reports during the past year from the
General Treasurei% and his account for the year will be laid before the
General Committee this day.

   --Since the meeting at York the following have been elected Corre-

sponding Members of the Association :
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,

Hubrecht, Dr. A. A. W.

     It is with the deepest regret that the Council announce the untimely
death of Professor F. M. Balfour, F.R.S., so lately appointed a General
Secretary. In him science has lost a student of i-are genius and un-

wearied industry, the Association one who would have served it well and

ably.

     In respect of the Resolution referred by the General Committee :
' That the Council be I'equested to consider the number and position of
delegates from Scientific Societies, and the regulations which should

be adopted for governing their relations to the Association,' the Council

beg leave to make the following recommendations to the General Com-

--mittee : (1) The omission in the rules (General Committee, Class B

Temporaiy Members Д 1) of the words 'and the Secretary of such
Society ' which follow the words ' or, in his absence, a delegate repre-
senting him.' (2) The appointment of a Committee in order to draw up
suggestions upon methods of more systematic observation and plans of
operation ibr local societies, together with a more uniform mode of pub-
lication of the results of their work. If is recommended that this Com-
mittee should draw up a list of local societies which publish their

proceedings.

     Upon the resolution of the General Committee requesting the Council
to consider how far it may be expedient to take steps to ascertain the

feeling of foreign Scientific Associations as to the advisability of holding
an International Scientific Congress, the Council have to report that
while recognising the difficulties which will attend the endeavour they

recommend that steps be taken to ascertain the feeling of foreign

Scientific Associations, similar in character to the British Association,
EEPOET OF THE COUNCIL.                                     lix

upon this question, and they request authority to make the necessary

communications to foi-eign Societies.
     In regard to the resolution of the General Committee empowering the

Council to confer with the Royal Geographical Society on the subject of

the Exploration of the Snowy Mountain Range of Eastern Equatorial
Africa, and to contribute the sum of 100/. towards the expenses of an

expedition, the Council have been informed by the Council of the Royal
Geographical Society, in a letter dated June 26, that they have decided
upon undertaking the expedition, and have secured the services of the
well-known and experienced explorer, Mr. Thomson; the Treasurer has
accordingly paid the above-named contribution.

    An invitation to visit Canada in 1883, warmly supported by the

Governor-General, His Excellency the Marquis of Lome, was received at
the end of last year, but the Council were obliged to reply that the vote
of the General Committee at York accepting the invitation to Oxford
precluded them from entertaining the question for that year. With
reference, however, to the Meeting for 1883, the Council regret to inform
the General Committee that unforeseen difficulties have recently obliged

their intended hosts at Oxford to express a desire that the proposed visit

of the Association should be for a time postponed. Under these circum-
stances Southport and Birmingham have renewed their invitation for
1883, and invitations for 1884 have been received from Birmingham,
Southport, Aberdeen, and Nottingham.

     The Council propose that, in accordance with the regulations, the five
retiring members shall be the foUowino- :

Mr. Abel.                            Professor Newton.
Mr. J. Evans.                        General Pitt-Rivers.
Professor G. C. Foster.

                                                             desirable.

     That the Council be empowered to take steps for amalgamating the
Departments of Zoology and Botany and of Anatomy and Physiology

for the ensuing year, should this seem desirable.

     That the Council be empowered to appoint a Committee, as recom-
mended in their report adopted by the General Committee on August 23,
in order to draw up suggestions upon methods of more systematic obser-

vation and plans of operation for local societies, together with a more

uniform mode of publication of the results of their work. It is recom-

mended that this Committee should draw up a list of local societies

which publish their pi'oceedings.

That the Council be empowered to communicate with Foreign Scientific

Associations with the view of promoting the organization of an Inter-

national Scientific Congress.

That the Council be empowered to appoint a Committee, upon which

the several sections of the Association be equally represented, for the

purpose of co-operating with the Council in considering the best arrange-

ments for securing a representative gathering of the Association at the

meeting pi-oposed to be held at Montreal.

                C. WILLIAM SIEMENS,

D.C.L. (Oxon), LL.D. (Glasc. and Dabl.), Ph.D., F.R.S., F.C.S.,

                               PRESIDENT.

In venturing to address the British Association from this chair, I feel
that I have taken upon myself a task involving very serious responsibility.
The Association has for half a century fulfilled the important mission of
drawing together, once every year, scientists from all parts of the country
for the purpose of discussing questions of mutual interest, of endowing
research, and of cultivating those personal relations which aid so power-
fully in harmonising views, and in stimulating concerted action for the
advancement of science.

A sad event casts a shadow over our gathering. While still mourning

the irreparable loss Science had sustained in the person of Chai-les Darwin,

whose bold conceptions, patient labour, and genial mind made him almost

a type of unsurpassed excellence, telegraphic news reached Cambridge,

just a month ago, to the effect that our General Secretary, Professor

F. M. Balfour, had lost his life during an attempted ascent of the Aiguille

Blanche de Peteret. Although only thirty years of age, few men have

won distinction so rapidly and so deservedly. After attending the

lectures of Dr. Michael Foster, he completed his studies of Biology under

Dr. Anton Dohrn at the Zoological Station of Naples in 1875. In 1878

he was elected a Fellow, and in November last a member of Council

of the Royal Society, when he was also awarded one of the Royal Medals

for his embryological researches. Within a short interval of time Glasgow

University conferred on him their honorary degree of LL.D., he was

elected President of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, and after having

declined very tempting offers from the Universities of Oxford and Edin-

burgh, he accepted a professorship of Animal Morphology created for

him by his own University. Few men could have borne without hurt

such a stream of honourable distinctions, but in j^oung Balfour genius

and independence of thought were happily blended with industry and

personal modesty                                                                                 these won for him  the friendship,  esteem,  and admira-
                                                                                              ;

tion of all who knew him.

It affords me gi-eat satisfaction to qualify the sad impression produced

1882.                                                                                            B

by this event, by the happy one of the safe return to these shores of that
most persistent and disinterested Arctic explorer, Mr. B. Leigh Smith,

together -with his much enduring crew and valiant rescuers.

     Since the days of the first meeting of the Association in York in
1831, great changes have taken place in the means at our disposal
for exchanging views, either personally or through the medium of type.
The creation of the railway system has enabled congenial minds to
attend frequent meetings of those special Societies which have sprung

into existence since the foundation of the British Association, amongst

which I need only name here the Physical, Geographical, Meteorological,
and Anthropological, cultivating abstract science, and the Institution of
Mechanical Engineers, of Naval Architects, the Iron and Steel Institute,

the Society of Telegraph Engineers and Electricians, the Gas Institute,

the Sanitary Institute, and the Society of Chemical Industry, repre-

senting applied science. These meet at frequent intervals in London,

whilst others, having similar objects in view, hold their meetings at

the University towns, and at other centres of intelligence and industry

throughout the country, giving evidence of great mental activity, and

producing some of those very results which the founders of the British

Association wished to see realised. If we consider fui-ther the extra-

ordinary development of scientific journalism which has taken place,

it cannot surprise us when we meet with expressions of opinion to the

effect that the British Association has fulfilled its mission, and should

now yield its place to those special Societies it has served to call into
existence. On the other hand, it may be urged that the brilliant success

of last year's Anniversary Meeting, enhanced by the comprehensive address

mydelivered on that occasion by      distinguished predecessor in ofiice,

Sir John Lubbock, has proved, at least, that the British Association is

not dead in the aflections of its members, and it behoves us at this, the
first ordinary gathering in the second half-century, to consider what are

the strong points to rely upon for the continuance of a career of success

and usefulness.

If the facilities brought home to our doors of acquiring scientific

information have increased, the necessities for scientific inquiry have

increased in a greater ratio. The time was when science was cultivated

only by the few, who looked npon its application to the arts and

manufactures as almost beneath their consideration ; this they were

content to leave in the hands of others, who, with only commercial aims

in view, did not aspire to further the objects of science for its own sake,

but thought only of benefiting by its teachings. Progress could not be

rapid under this condition of things, because the man of pure science

rarely pursued his inquiry beyond the mere enunciation of a physical

or chemical principle, whilst the simple practitioner was at a loss how

to harmonise the new knowledge with the stock of information which

formed his mental capital in trade.
   ADDRESS.  3

        The advancement of the last fifty years has, I venture to submit,
   rendered theory and practice so interdependent, that an intimate union

   between them is a matter of absolute necessity for our future progress.

   Take, for instance, the art of dyeing, and we find that the discovery of

   new colouring matters derived from waste products, such as coal-tar,

   completely changes its practice, and renders an intimate knowledge of

   the science of chemistry a matter of absolute necessity to the practitioner.

   In telegraphy and in the new arts of applying electricity to lighting, to
   the transmission of power, and to metallurgical operations, problems

   arise at every turn, requiring for their solution not only an intimate

   acquaintance with, but a positive advance upon, electrical science as
   established by purely theoretical research in the laboratory. In general
   engineering the mere practical art of constructing a machine so designed
   and proportioned as to produce mechanically the desired effect, would

   suffice no longer. Our increased knowledge of the nature of the mutual
   relations between the difierent forms of energy makes us see clearly
   what are the theoretical limits of effect; these, although beyond our
   absolute reach, may be looked upon as the asymptotes to be approached
   indefinitely by the hyperbolic course of practical progress. Cases arise,
   moreover, where the introduction of new materials of construction, or the
   call for new effects, renders former rules wholly insufiicient. In all theso
   cases practical knowledge has to go hand in hand with advanced science

   in order to accomplish the desired end.

       Far be it from me to think lightly of the ardent students of nature,

   who, in their devotion to research, do not allow their minds to travel into
   the regions of utilitarianism and of self-interest. These, the high priests

   of science, command our utmost admiration ; but it is not to them that we
   can look for our current progress in practical science, much less can we
   look for it to the ' rule of thumb ' practitioner, who is guided by what
   comes nearer to instinct than to reason. It is to the man of science
   who also gives attention to practical questions, and to the practitioner
   who devotes part of his time to the prosecution of strictly scientific
   investigations, that we owe the rapid progress of the present day, both

   merging more and more into one class, that of pioneers in the domain of

   nature. It is such men that Archimedes must have desired when he

   refused to teach his disciples the art of constructing his powerful ballistic

   engines, exhorting them to give their attention to the principles involved
   in their construction, and that Telford, the founder of the Institution of
   Civil Engineers, must have had in his mind's eye, when he (at the sug-

   gestion of Tredgold) defined civil engineering as ' the art of directing the

   great sources of power in nature.'

       These considerations may serve to show that although we see the men

   of both abstract and applied science group themselves in minor bodies for
   the better prosecution of special objects, the points of contact between
   the difierent branches of knowledge are ever multiplying, all tending to
   form part of a mighty tree--the tree of modern science--under whose

ample shadow its cultivators will find it both profitable and pleasant to
meet, at least once a year; and considering that this tree is not the
growth of one country only, but spreads both its roots and branches
far and wide, it appears desirable that at these yearly gatherings other
nations should be more fully represented than has hitherto been the case.
The subjects discussed at our meetings are without exception of general

interest, but many of them bear an international character, such as the

systematic collection of magnetic, astronomical, meteorological, and

geodetical observations, the formation of a universal code for signalling

at sea, and for distinguishing lighthouses, and especially the settle-
ment of scientific nomenclatures and units of measurement, regarding all
of which an international accord is a matter of the utmost practical im-

portance.

     As regards the measures of length and weight it is to be regretted
that this country still stands aloof from the movement initiated in France

towards the close of last century ; but, considering that in scientific

work metrical measure is now almost universally adopted, and that its

use has been already legalised in this country, I venture to hope that
its universal adoption for commercial purposes will soon follow as a
matter of course. The practical advantages of such a measure to the

trade of this country would, I am convinced, bo very great, for English
goods, such as machinery or metal rolled to current sections, are now

almost excluded from the continental market, owing to the unit measure
employed in their production. The principal impediment to the adoption
of the metre consists in the strange anomaly that although it is legal
to use that measure in commerce, and although a copy of the standard
metre is kept in the Standards' Department of the Board of Trade, it
is impossible to procure legalised rods representing it, and to use a non-

legalised copy of a standard in commerce is deemed fraudulent. Would

it not be desirable that the British Association should endeavour to brino-
about the use in this country of the metre and kilogramme, and, as a
preliminai-y stop, ask the Government to be represented on the Inter-
national Metrical Commission, whoso admirable establishment at Sevreg
possesses, independently of its practical work, considerable scientific in-
 terest, as a well-found laboratory for developing methods of precise
measurement ?

Next in importance to accurate measures of length, weight, and time,

stand, for the purposes of modern science, those of electricity.
     The remarkably clear lines separating conductors from non-con-

ductors of electricity, and magnetic from non-magnetic substances, enable
us to measure electrical quantities and efi'ects with almost mathematical

precision                                     and,  although the ultimate nature of this, the youngest
                                           ;

scientifically investigated form of energy, is yet wrapt in mystery, its
laws are the most clearly established, and its measuring instruments

(galvanometers, electrometers, and magnetometers) are amongst the.

most accurate in physical science. Nor could any branch of science or

industry be named in which electrical phenomena do not occur, to exer-

cise their direct and important influence.

If, then, electricity stands foremost amongst the exact sciences, it

follows that its unit measures should be determined with the utmost

accuracy. Yet, twenty years ago, very little advance had been made

Ohmtowards the adoption of a rational system.  had, it is true, given

us the fixed relations existing between electromotive force, resistance and

quantity of cnrrent ; Joule had established the dynamical equivalent of
heat and electricity, and Gauss and Weber had proposed their elaborate

system of absolute magnetic measurement. But these invaluable re-

searches appeared only as isolated efforts, when, in 1862, the Electric

Unit Committee was appointed by the British Association, at the instance

of Sir William Thomson, and it is to the long-continued activity of this

Committee that the world is indebted for a consistent and practical

system of measurement, which, after being modified in details, received

universal sanction last year by the International Electrical Congress

assembled at Paris.

At this Congress, which was attended officially by the leading

physicists of all civilised countries, the attempt was successfully made to

bring about a union between the statical system of measurement that had

been followed in Germany and some other countries, and the magnetic or

dynamical system developed by the British Association, also between the

geometrical measure of resistance, the (Werner) Siemens unit, that had

been generally adopted abroad, and the British Association unit in-

tended as a multiple of Weber's absolute unit, though not entirely fulfil-

ling that condition. The Congress, while adopting the absolute system

of the British Association, referred the final determination of the unit

measure of resistance to an International Committee, to be appointed by

the representatives of the several Governments ; they decided to retain
the mercury standard for reproduction and comparison, by which means

the advantages of both systems are happily combined, and much valuable

labour is utilised ; only, instead of expressing electrical quantities directly

in absolute measure, the Congress has embodied a consistent system,

based on the Ohm, the Centimetre, the Gramme, and the Second, in which

the units are of a value convenient for practical measurements. In this,

which we must hereafter know as the ' practical system,' as distinguished
from the ' absolute system,' the units are named after leading physicists,

the Ohm, Ampere, Volt, Coulomb, and Farad.

I would venture to suggest that two further units might, with advan-

tage, be added to the system decided on by the International Congress

at Paris. The first of these is the unit of magnetic quantity or pole.
It is of much importance, and few will regard otherwise than with

satisfaction the suggestion of Clauslus that the unit should be called a

' Weber,' thus retaining a name most closely connected with electrical

measurements, and only omitted by the Congress in order to avoid the
6 Heport--1882.

risk of confusion in the magnitude of the unit cilrtent with which his
name had been formerly associated.

     The other unit I would suggest adding to the list is that of power.
The power conveyed by a current of an Ampere through the diiFerence of

potential of a Volt is the unit consistent with the practical system. It

might be appropriately called a Watt, in honour of that master mind

in mechanical science, James Watt. He ifc was who first had a clear

physical conception of power, and gave a rational method of measuring it.

A Watt, then, expresses the rate of an Ampere multiplied by a Volt,

whilst a horse-power is 746 Watts, and a Cheval de Vapeur 735.
     The system of electro-magnetic units would then be :

(1) Weber, the unit of magnetic quantity  = 10* C.G.S. Units.

(2) Ohm      ,,        =,, resistance 10^          ,,
                         =electromotive force 10^
(3) Volt
                       current            = 10"'
(4) Ampere

(5) Coulomb            quantity           =10"'

(6) Watt               power              =: 10'^

(7) Farad              capacity           := 10-^

Before the list can be looked ujion as complete two other units may

have to be added, the one expressing that of magnetic field, and the

other of heat in terms of the electro-magnetic system. Sir William

Thomson suggested the former at the Paris Congress, and pointed out

that it would be proper to attach to ifc the name of Gauss, who first

theoretically and practically reduced observations of terrestrial magnetism

Ato absolute measure.  Gauss will, then, be defined as the intensity of

field produced by a Weber at a distance of one centimetre and the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

Weber will be the absolute C.G.S. unit strength of magnetic pole.
Thus the mutual force between two ideal point-poles, each of one Weber

strength held at unit distance asunder, will be one dyne; that is to

say, the force which, acting for a second of time on a gramme of matter,

generates a velocity of one centimetre per second.

     The unit of heat has hitherto been taken variously as the heat re-
quired to raise a pound of water at the freezing-point through 1░ Fahren-

heit or Centigrade, or, again, the heat necessary to raise a kilogramme of
water 1░ Centigrade. The inconvenience of a unit so entirely arbitrary

is sufficiently apparent to justify the introduction of one based on the

electro-magnetic system, viz. the heat generated in one second by the
current of an Ampere flowing through the resistance of an Ohm. In
absolute measure its value is 10^ C.G.S. units, and, assuming Joule's

equivalent as 42,000,000, it is the heat necessary to raise 0*238 grammes

of water 1░ Centigrade, or, approximately, the riyoo^^ part of the arbitrary
unit of a pound of water raised 1░ Fahrenheit and the ^Vij^h of the

kUogramme of water raised 1░ Centigrade. Such a heat unit, if found
acceptable, might with great propriety, I think, be called the Joule,
                          ADDRESS.                                             7

after the man who has done so mucli to develop the dynamical theory

of heat.

     Professor Clausius urges the advantages of the statical system of
measurement for simplicity, and shows that the numerical values of the
two systems can readily be compared by the introduction of a factor,

which he proposes to call the critical velocity ; this, Weber has already
shown to be nearly the same as the velocity of light. It is not imme-
diately evident how by the introduction of a simple multiple, signifying
a velocity, the statical can be changed into dynamical values, and I am

indebted to my friend Sir William Thomson for an illustration which

struck me as remarkably happy and convincing. Imagine a ball of con-

ducting matter so constituted that it can at pleasure be caused to shrink.

Now let it first be electrified and left insulated with any quantity of

electricity on it. After that, let it be connected with the earth by an
excessively fine wire or a not perfectly dry silk fibre ; and let it shrink
just so rapidly as to keep its potential constant, till the whole charge is
carried ofi". The velocity with which its surface approaches its centre is

the electrostatic measure of the conducting power of the fibre. Thus we
see how 'conducting power' is, in electrostatic theory, properly measured
in terms of a velocity. Weber had shown how, in electromagnetic

theory, the resistance, or the reciprocal of the conducting power of a
conductor, is properly measured by a velocity. The critical velocity,
which measures the conducting power in electrostatic reckoning and the
resistance in electromagnetic, of one and the same conductor, measures

the number of electrostatic units in the electromagnetic unit of electric

quantity.

     Without waiting for the assembling of the International Committee
charged with the final determination of the Ohm, one of its most dis-
tinguished members, Lord Rayleigh, has, with his collaborateure, Mrs.
Sidgwick, continued his important investigation in this direction at the
Cavendish Laboratory, and has lately placed before the Royal Society a
result which will prolaably not be surpassed in accuracy. His redetermi-
nation brings him into close accord with Dr. Werner Siemens, their two
values of the mercury unit being 0-95418 and 0-9536 of the B.A. unit

=respectively, or 1 mercury unit 0-941.3 X 10^ C.G.S. units.

     Shortly after the publication of Lord Rayleigh's recent results, Messrs.
Glazebrook, Dodds, and Sargant, of Cambridge, communicated to the
Royal Society two determinations of the Ohm, by difierent methods;
and it is satisfactory to find that their final values differ only in the fourth

decimal, the figures being, according to

Professor E. Wiedemann, of Leipzig, has lately called attention to the

 importance of having the Ohm detei'mined in the most accurate manner

 possible, and enumerates four distinct methods, all of which should
 unquestionably be tried with a view of obtaining concordant results,
 because upon its accuracy will depend the whole future system of
 measurement of energy of whatever form.

      The word Energy was first used by Young in a scientific sense, and

 represents a conception of recent date, being the outcome of the labours
 of Carnot, Mayer, Joule, Grove, Clausius, Clerk-Maxwell, Thomson,

. Stokes, Helmholtz, Macquorn-Rankine, and other labourers, who have
 accomplished for the science regarding the forces in Nature what we owe

 to Lavoisier, Dalton, Berzelius, Liebig, and others, as regards Chemistry.

 In this short word Energy we find all the efforts in nature, including

 electricity, heat, light, chemical action, and dynamics, equally represented,

forming, to use Dr. Tyndall's apt expression, so many 'modes of motion.' It
will readily be conceived that when we have established a fixed numerical
relation between these different modes of motion, we know beforehand
what is the utmost result we can possibly attain in converting one form

 of energy into another, and to what extent our apparatus for effecting
the conversion falls short of realising it. The difference between
ultimate theoretical effect and that actually obtained is commonly called

loss, but, considering that energy is indestructible, represents really

secondary effect which we obtain without desiring it. Thus friction in

the working parts of a machine represents a loss of mechanical effect, but
is a gain of heat, and in like manner the loss sustained in transfen-ing
electrical energy from one point to another is accounted for by heat
genei'ated in the conductor. It sometimes suits our purpose to augment
the transformation of electrical into heat energy at certain points of the

circuit, when the heat rays become visible, and we have the incandescence

electric light. In effecting a complete severance of the conductor for a
short distance, after the current has been established, a very great local
resistance is occasioned, giving rise to the electric arc, the highest develop-

ment of heat ever attained. Vibration is another form of lost energy in
mechanism, but who would call it a loss if it proceeded from the violin of
a Joachim or a Norman-Neruda ?

      Electricity is the form of energy best suited for transmitting an effect
from one place to another ; the electric current passes through certain

--substances^the metals with a velocity limited only by the retarding

influence caused by electric charge of the surrounding dielectric, but
approaching probably under favourable conditions that of radiant heat
and light, or 300,000 kilometres per second; it refuses, however, to pass
through oxidised substances, glass, gums, or through gases except when

in a highly rarefied condition. It is easy therefore to confine the electric

current within bounds, and to direct it through narrow channels of
extraordinary length. The conducting wire of an Atlantic cable is
such a narrow channel; it consists of a copper wire, or strand of
                    ADDBESS.                                        9

wires, 5 mm. in diameter, by nearly 5,000 kilometres in length, con.
fined electrically by a coating of guttapercha about 4 mm. in thick-

ness. The electricity from a small galvanic battery passing into

this channel prefers the long journey to America in the good con-

ductor, and back thi'ough the earth, to the shorter journey across the

4 mm. in thickness of insulating material. By an improved arrange-

ment the alternating currents employed to work long submarine cables

do not actually complete the circuit, but are merged in a condenser at

the receiving station after having produced their extremely slight but

certain effect upon the receiving instrument, the beautiful syphon recorder

of Sir William Thomson. So perfect is the channel and so precise the

action of both the transmitting and receiviug instruments employed, that

two systems of electric signals may be passed simultaneously through the

same cable in opposite directions, producing independent records at either

end. By the application of this duplex mode of working to the Direct

United States cable nnder the superintendence of Dr. Muirhead, its

transmitting power was increased from twenty-five to sixty words a

minute, being equivalent to about twelve currents or primary impulses

per second. In transmitting these impulse-currents simultaneously from

both ends of the line, it must not be imagined, however, that they pass

each other in  the  manner of liquid  waves belonging to  separate  systems
                                                                                                     ;

such a supposition would involve momentum in the electric flow, and

although the effect produced is analogous to such an action, it rests upon

--totally different grounds namely, that of a local circuit at each terminus

being called into action automatically whenever two similar currents are

passed into the line simultaneously from both ends. In extending this

principle of action quadruples telegraphy has been rendered possible,

although not yet for long submarine lines.

The minute currents here employed are far surpassed as regards delicacy

and frequency by those revealed to us by that marvel of the present day, the

telephone. The electric currents caused by the vibrations of a diaphragm

acted upon by the human voice naturally vary in frequency and intensity

according to the number and degree of those vibrations, and each motor

current in exciting the electro-magnet forming part of the receiving

instrument deflects the iron diaphragm occupying the position of an

armature to a greater or smaller extent according to its strength. Savart

found that the fundamental la springs from 440 complete vibrations in a

second, but what must be the frequency and modulations of the motor

current and of magnetic variations necessary to convey to the ear,

through the medium of a vibrating armature, such a complex of human

voices and of musical instruments as constitutes an opera perforroftnce ?

And yet such performances could be distinctly heard and even enjoyed,

as an artistic treat, by applying to the ears a pair of the double tele-

phonic receivers at the Paris Electrical Exhibition, when connected with

a pair of transmitting instruments in front of the footlights of the Grand

Opera. In connection with the telei^hone, and with its equally remarkable
10 EEPORT-- 1882.

adjunct the microphone, the names of Riess, Graham Bell, Edison, and

Hughes will ever be remembered.

Considering the extreme delicacy of the currents working a telephone,

it is obvious that those caused by induction from neighbouring tele-

graphic line wires would seriously interfere with the former, and mar the

speech or other sounds produced through their action. To avoid such

interference the telephone wires if suspended in the air require to be

placed at some distance from telegraphic line wires, and to be supported

by separate posts. Another way of neutralising interference consists in

twisting two separately insulated telephone wires together, so as to form

a strand, and in using the two conductors as a metallic circuit to the

exclusion of the earth ; the working current will, in that case, receive

equal and opposite inductive influences, and will therefore remain un-

affected by them. On the other hand two insulated wires instead of one

are required for working one set of instruments ; and a serious increase

in the cost of installation is thus caiiscd. To avoid this Mr. Jacob

has lately suggested a plan of combining pairs of such metallic circuits

again into separate working pairs, and these again with other

workiflg pairs, whereby the total number of telephones capable of being

worked without interference is made to equal the total number of

single wires em^sloyed. The working of telephones and telegraphs in

metallic circuit has the fui'ther advantage that mutual volta induction

between the outgoing and returning currents favours the transit, and

neutralises on the other hand the retarding influence caused by change in

underground or submarine conductors. These conditions are particularly

favourable to underground line wii'cs, which possess other important

advantages over the still prevailing overground sj'stem, in that they

are unaffected by atmospheric electricity, or by snowstorms and heavy

gales, which at not very rare intervals of time put us back to pre-

telegraphic days, when the letter-carrier was our swiftest messenger.
    The underground system of telegraphs, first introduced into Germany

by Werner Siemens in the years 1847-48, had to yield for a time to the

overground system  owing to technical  difficulties                                               but  it has  been again
                                                                                               ;

resorted to within the last four years, and multiple land cables of solid

construction now connect all the important towns of that country. The

first cost of such a system is no doubt considerable (being about 38L per

kilometre of conductor as against 81. 10s. the cost of land lines) ; but as
the underground wires are exempt from frequent repairs and renewals,
and as they insui-e continuity of service, they are decidedly the cheaper
and better in the end. The experience aff"orded by the early introduction

of the underground system in Germany was not, however, without its

beneficial results, as it brought to light the phenomena of lateral
induction, and of faults in the insulating coating, matters which had to be
understood before submarine telegraphy could be attempted with any

reasonable prospect of success.

Regarding the transmission of power to a distance the electric current
               ADDRESS.  11

has now entered the lists in competition with compressed air, the

hydraulic accumulator, and the quick running rope as used at Schaff-
hausen to utilise the power of the Rhine fall. The transformation of
electrical into mechanical energy can be accomplished with no further
loss than is due to such incidental causes as friction and the heating of

wires ; these in a properly designed dynamo-electric machine do not exceed
ten per cent., as shown by Dr. John Hopkinson, and, judging from recent

experiments of my own, a still nearer approach to ultimate perfection is

attainable. Adhering, however, to Dr. Hopkinson's determination for

safety's sake, and assuming the same percentage in reconverting the
current into mechanical effect, a total loss of 19 per cent, results. To

this loss must be added that through electrical resistance in the connecting
line wires, which depends upon their length and conductivity, and that

due to heating by friction of the working parts of the machine. Taking

these as being equal to the internal losses incurred in the double pro-

-- =cess of conversion, there remains a useful effect of 100 38 62 per

cent., attainable at a distance, which agrees with experimental results,
although in actual practice it would not be safe at present to expect more

than 50 per cent, of ultimate useful effect, to allow for all incidental losses.

In using compressed air or water for the transmission of power, the

loss cannot be taken at less than 50 per cent., and, as it depends upon
fluid resistance, it increases with distance more rapidly than in the case of

electricity. Taking the loss of effect in all cases as 50 per cent., electric
transmission presents the advantage that an insulated wire does the work

of a pipo capable of withstanding high internal pressure, which latter

must be more costly to put down and to maintain. A second metallic

conductor is required, however, to complete the electrical circuit, as the
conducting power of the earth alone is found unreliable for passing

quantity currents, owing to the effects of polarization ; but as this second
conductor need not be insulated, water or gas pipes, railway metals

or fencing wire, may be called into requisition for this purpose. The

small space occupied by the electi-o-motor, its high working speed,

and the absence of waste products, render it specially available for the

general distribution of power to cranes and light machinery of every

Adescription,  loss of effect of 50 per cent, does not stand in the way

of such applications, for it must be remembered that a powerful central

engine of best construction produces motive power with a consumption

of two pounds of coal per horse-power per hour, whereas small engines
distributed over a district would consume not less than five ; we thus
see that there is an advantage in favour of electric transmission as
regards fuel, independently of the saving of labour and other collateral
benefits, which more than compensate for interest on the cost of instal-

lation.

    To agriculture, electric transmission of power seems well adapted for
effecting the various operations of the farm and fields from one centre.

Having worked such a system myself in combination with electric lighting
12 REPOBT-- 1882.

and horticulture for upwards of two years, I can speak with confidence
of its economy, and of the facility with which the work is accomplished
in charge of untrained persons.

     As regards the eflPect of the electric light upon vegetation there is

Alittle to add to what was stated in my paper read before Section

last year, and ordered to be printed with the Keport, except that in
experimenting upon wheat, barley, oats, and other cereals sown in the
open air, there was a marked difference between the growth of the plants
influenced and those uninfluenced by the electric light. This was not
very apparent till towards the end of February, when, with the first
appearance of mild weather, the plants under the influence of an electric
lamp of 4,000 candle power placed about 5 metres above the surface,

developed with extreme rapidity, so that by the end of May they stood
above 4 feet high, with the ears in full bloom, when those not under its

influence were under 2 feet in height, and showed no sign of the ear.
     In the electric railway first constructed by Dr. Werner Siemens, at

Berlin, in 1879, electric energy was transmitted to the moving carriage
or train of carriages, through the two rails upon which it moved, these
being sufficiently insulated from each other by being placed upon well
creosoted cross sleepers. At the Paris Electrical Exhibition the current
was conveyed through two separate conductors making sliding or

rolling contact with the carriage, wliereas in the electric railway now in
course of construction in the north of Ireland (which when completed

will have a length of twelve miles) a separate conductor will be pro-
vided by the side of the railway, and the return circuit completed
through the rails themselves, which in that case need not be insulated

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

secondary batteries will be used to store the surplus energy created in
running downhill, to be restored in ascending steep inclines, and for passing
roadways where the separate insulated conductor is not pi-acticable.

The electric railway possesses great advantages over horse or steam-power
for towns, in tunnels, and in all cases where natural sources of energy,
such as waterfalls, are available ; but it would not be reasonable to sup-
pose that it will in its present condition compete with steam propulsion
upon ordinary railways. The transmission of power by means of electric
conductors possesses the further advantage over other means of trans-

mission that, provided the resistance of the rails be not very great, the

power communicated to the locomotive reaches its maximum when the

--motion is at its minimum that is, in commencing to work, or when

--encountering an exceptional resistance 'whereas the utmost economy is

produced in the normal condition of working when the velocity of the

power-absorbing nearly equals that of tl^e current-producing machine.

     The deposition of metals from their solutions is perhaps the oldest of

all useful applications of the electric current, but it is only in very recent

times that the dynamo current has been practically applied to the refining
of copper and other metals, as now practised at Birmingham and else-
where, and upon an exceptionally large scale at Ocker, in Germany,
   ADDRESS.  1

   where the motive power is derived from a water-wheel. The dynamo
   machine there employed was exhibited at the Paris Electrical Exhibition
   by Dr. Werner Siemens, its peculiar feature being that the conductors

   upon the rotating armature consisted of solid bars of copper 30 mm.

   square, in section, which were found only just sufficient to transmit the
   large quantity of electricity of low tension necessary for this operation.
   One such machine consuming 4-horse power deposits about 300 kilo-
   grammes of copper per 24 hours.

       Electric energy may also be employed for heating purposes, but in

   this case it would obviously be impossible for it to compete in point of
   economy with the direct combustion of fuel for the attainment of ordinary

   degrees of heat. Bunsen and St. Claire De Ville have taught us, how-
   ever, that combustion becomes extremely sluggish when a temperature of

   1,800░ C. has been reached, and for effects at temperatures exceeding that

   limit the electric furnace will pi'obably find advantageous applications.
   Its specific advantage consists in being apparently unlimited in the degree

   of heat attainable, thus opening out a new field of investigation to the

   chemist and metallurgist. Tungsten has been melted in such a furnace,
   and 8 pounds of platinum have been reduced from the cold to the liquid
   condition in 20 minutes.

        The largest and most extensive application of electric energy at the
   present time is to lighting, but, considering how much has of late been
   said and written for and against this new illuminant, I shall here
   confine myself to a few general remarks. Joule has shown that if an
   electric current is passed through a conductor the whole of the energy
   lost by the current is converted into heat; or, if the resistance be
   localised, into radiant energy, comprising heat, light, and actinic rays.
   Neither the low heat rays nor the ultra-violet of highest refrangibility

   affect the retina, and may be regarded as lost energy, the effective rays

   being those between the red and violet of the spectrum, which in their
   combination produce the effect of white light.

        Regarding the proportion of luminous to non-luminous rays proceeding

   from an electric arc or incandescent wire, we have a most, valuable
   investigation by Dr. Tyndall, recorded in his work on ' Radiant Heat.'

   Dr. Tyndall shows that the luminous rays from a platinum wire heated

   to its highest point of incandescence, which may be taken at 1,700░ C,

   formed oV^h part of the total radiant energy emitted, and ^^V^^ P^^^ i^

   In order to apply these valuable data to the case of electric lighting
   by means of dynamo currents, it is necessary in the first place to deter-
   mine what is the power of 50 Grove's elements of the size iised by

   Dr. Tyndall, expressed in the practical scale of units as now established.
   From a few experiments lately undertaken for myself, it would appear

   that .50 such cells have an electro-motive force of 98-5 Volts, and an

   internal resistance of 13'5 Ohms, giving a current of 7"o Amperes when
   the cells are short-circuited. The resistance of a regulator such as Dr.

the power is given out as luminous rays, as against ^'jth in Dr. Tyndall's

--incandescent platinum a result suificiently approximate considering the

wide difference of conditions under which the two are compared.

These results are not only of obvious practical value, but they seem to

establish a fixed relation between current, temperature, and light produced,

which may serve as a means to determine temperatures exceeding the

melting point of platinum with greater accuracy than has hitherto been

possible by actinimetric methods in which the thickness of the luminous

atmosphere must necessarily exercise a disturbing influence. It is probably

owing to this circumstance that the temperature of the electric arc as well

as that of the solar photosphere has frequently been greatly over-estimated.

The principal argument in favour of the electric light is furnished by

its immunity from products of combustion which not only heat the
lighted apartments, but substitute carbonic acid and deleterious sulphur

compounds for the oxygen upon which respiration depends ; the electric

light is white instead of yellow, and thus enables us to see pictures, furni-

ture, and flowers as by daylight ; it supports growing plants instead of

poisoning them, and by its means we can carry on photography and

many other industries at night as well as during the day. The objec-

tion frequently urged against the electric light, that it depends upon

the continuous motion of steam or gas engines, which are liable to

accidental stoppage, is met by the introduction into practical use of the

secondary battery ; this, although not embodying a new conception, has

lately been gi-eatly improved in power and constancy by Plante, Faure,

Volckmar, Sellon, and others, and promises to accomplish for electricity

what the gas-holder has done for the supply of gas and the accumulator

for hydraulic transmission of power.

It can no longer be a matter of reasonable doubt, therefore, that

electric lighting will take its place as a public illuminant, and that, even

though its cost should be found greater than that of gas, it will be

preferred for the lighting of drawing-rooms and dining-rooms, theatres
ADDRESS.  15

and concert-rooms, museums, cliurclies, warehouses, show-rooms, print-
ing establishments and factoiries, and also the cabins and engine-rooms of
passenger steamers. In the cheaper and more powerful form of the arc
light, it has proved itself superior to any other illuminant for spreading
artificial daylight over the large areas of harbours, railway stations, and

the sites of public works. When placed within a holophote the electric

lamp has already become a powerful auxiliary in effecting military opera-
tions both by sea and land.

    The electric light may be worked by natural sources of power such as

waterfalls, the tidal wave, or the wind, and it is conceivable that these

may be utilised at considerable distances by means of metallic conductors.
Some five years ago I called attention to the vastness of those sources

of energy, and the facility oS'ered by electrical conduction in rendering
them available for lighting and power-supply, while Sir William Thomson
made this important matter the subject of his admirable address to

ASection last year at York, and dealt with it in an exhaustive manner.

     The advantages of the electric light and of the distribution of power
by electricity have lately been recognised by the British Government, which
has just passed a Bill through Parliament to facilitate the establishment

of electrical conductors in towns, subject to certain regulating clauses to

protect the interests of the public and of local authorities. Assuming the
cost of electric light to be practically the same as gas, the preference for
one or other will in each application be decided iipon grounds of relative
convenience, but I venture to think that gas-lighting will hold its own
as the poor man's friend.

     Gaa is an institution of the utmost value to the artisan ; it requires
hardly any attention, is supplied upon regulated terms, and gives with
what should be a cheerful light a genial warmth, which often saves the
lighting of a fire. The time is moreover not far distant, I venture to
think, when both rich and poor will largely resort to gas as the most
convenient, the cleanest, and the cheapest of heating agents, and when
raw coal will be seen only at the colliery or the gasworks. In all
cases where the town to be supplied is within say 30 miles of the

colliery, the gasworks may with advantage be planted at the mouth, or

still better at the bottom of the pit, whereby all haulage of fuel would
be avoided, and the gas, in its ascent from the bottom of the collieiy,
would acquire an onward pressure sufficient probably to impel it to its
destination. The possibility of transporting combustible gas through
pipes for such a distance has been proved at Pittsburg, where natural gas
from the oil district is used in large quantities for heating purposes.

     The quasi monopoly so long enjoyed by gas companies has had the
inevitable effect of checking progress. The gas being supplied by meter,

it has been seemingly to the advantage of the companies to give
merely the prescribed illuminating power, and to discourage the inven-
tion of economical burners, in order that the consumption might reach a
16 REPOET-- 1882.

maximum. The application of gas for heating purposes has not been
encouraged, and is still made diflScalt in consequence of the objectionable
practice of reducing the pressure in the mains during daytime to the

lowest possible point consistent with prevention of atmospheric indraught.

The introduction of the electric light has convinced gas managers and
directors that such a policy is no longer tenable, but must give way to
one of technical progress ; new processes for cheapening the production
and increasing the purity and illuminating power of gas are being fully
discussed before the Gas Institute ; and improved burners, rivalling the
electric light in brilliancy, greet our eyes as we pass along our principal

thoroughfares.

     Regarding the importance of the gas supply as it exists at present,

we find from a Government return that the capital invested in gasworks

in England, other than those of local authorities, amounts to 80,000,000Z.;
in these 4,281,048 tons of coal are converted annually, producing 43,000
million cubic feet of gas, and about 2,800,000 tons of coke ; whereas the

total amount of coal annually converted in the United Kingdom may be

estimated at 9,000,000 tons, and the by-products therefrom at 500,000
tons of tar, 1,000,000 tons of ammonia liquor, and 4,000,000 tons of coke,

according to the returns kindly furnished me by the managers of many
of the gasworks and corporations. To these may be added say 120,000

tons of sulphur, which up to the present time is a waste product.

  --Previous to the year 1856 that is to say, before Mr. W. H. Perkin

had invented his practical process, based chiefly upon the theoretical
investigations of Hofman, regarding the coal-tar bases and the chemical

--constitution of indigo the value of coal-tar in London was scarcely a

halfpenny a gallon, and in country places gas-makers were glad to give

it away. Up to that time the coal-tar industry had consisted chiefly in

separating the tar by distillation into naphtha, creosote, oils, and pitch.

A tew distillers, however, made small quantities of benzene, which had

-- --been first shown by Mansfield, in 1849 to exist in coal-tar naphtha

mixed with toluene, cumene, &c. The discovery, in 1856, of the mauve
or aniline purple gave a great impetus to the coal-tar trade, inasmuch

as it necessitated the separation of large quantities of benzene, or a
mixture of benzene and toluene, from the naphtha. The trade was
further increased by the discovery of the magenta or rosaniline dye,
which required the same products for its preparation. In the mean-
time, carbolic acid was gradually introduced into commerce, chiefly as

a disinfectant, but also for the production of colouring matter.

     The next most important development arose fi-om the discovery by
Grsebe and Liebermann that alizarine, the colouring pi*inciple of the
madder root, was allied to anthracene, a hydrocarbon existing in coal-tar.
The production of this colouring matter from anthracene followed, and
is now one of the most important operations connected with tar-distilling.
The success of the alizarine made in this manner has been so great that
it has almost entirely superseded the use of madder, which is now culti-

also used in their preparation. These splendid dyes have replaced

cochineal in many of its applications, and have thus seriously interfered

with its use. The discovery of artificial indigo by Professor Baeyer is

of great interest. For the preparation of this colouring matter toluene is

required. At present artificial indigo does not compete seriously with

the natural product ; but should it eventually be prepared in quantity
from toluene, a further stimulus will be given to the coal-tar trade.

    The colour industry utilises even now practically all the benzene, a

large proportion of the solvent naphtha, all the anthracene, and a portion

of   the  naphthalene  resulting    from  the  distillation                         of  coal-tar                                      and  the
                                                                                                                                   ;

value of the colouring matter thus produced is estimated by Mr. Perkin

at 3,350,000Z.

     The demand for ammonia may be taken as unlimited, on account of

its  high   agricultural value  as  a    manure                                  and, considering the failing
                                                                              ;

supply of guano and the growing necessity for stimulating the fertility of

our soil, an increased production of ammonia may be regarded as a matter

of national importance, for the supply of which we have to look almost

exclusively to our gasworks. The present production of 1,000,000 tons

of liquor yields 95,000 tons of sulphate of ammonia ; which, taken at

20Z. 10s. a ton, represents an annual value of 1,947,500L

     The total annual value of the gasworks' by-products may be estimated

as follows :

     Taking the coal used, 9,000,000 tons, at 12.s., equal 5,400,000Z. ; it

follows that the by-products alone exceed in value the coal used by

very nearly 3,000,000?.

     In using raw coal for heating purposes these valuable products are

not only absolutely lost to us, but in their stead we are favoured with
those semi-gaseous by-products in the atmosphere too well known to the

denizens of London and other large towns as smoke. Professor Roberts
has calculated that the soot in the pall hanging over London on a

winter's day amounts to fifty tons, and that the carbon present as

hydrocarbons and in the half-burnt form of carbonic oxide, a poisonous

compound, resulting from the imperfect combustion of coal, may be

taken as at least five times that amount. Mr. Aitken has shown,

moreover, in an interesting paper communicated to the Royal Society of

     1882.                                c
18 REPORT-- 1882.

Bdinburgh, last year, that the fine dust resulting from the imperfect

combustion of coal is mainly instrumental in the formation of fog ; each

particle of solid matter attracting to itself aqueous vapour ; these glo-

bules of fog are rendered particularly tenacious and disagreeable by the

presence of tar vapour, another result of imperfect combustion of raw
fuel, which might be turned to much better account at the dye-works.

The hurtful influence of smoke upon public health, the great personal

discomfort to which it gives rise, and the vast expense it indirectly

causes through the destruction of our monuments, pictures, furniture,

and apparel, are now being recognised, as is evinced by the success of

recent Smoke Abatement Exhibitions. The most effectual remedy would

result from a general recognition of the fact that wherever smoke is

produced, fuel is being consumed wastefnlly, and that all our calorific

effects, from the largest down to the domestic fire, can be realised as

completely and more economically, without allowing any of the fuel

employed to reach the atmosphere unburnt. This most desirable result

may be effected by the use of gas for all heating purposes, with or without

the addition of coke or anthracite.

The cheapest form of gas is that obtained through the entire distilla-

tion of fuel in such gas-producers as are now largely used in working

the furnaces of glass,i iron, and steel works ; but gas of this description
would not be available for the supply of towns, owing to its bulk, about

two-thirds of its volume being nitrogen. The use of water-gas, resulting

from the decomposition of steam in passing through a hot chamber filled

with coke, has been suggested, but this gas also is objectionable, because

it contains, besides hydrogen, the poisonous and inodorous gas carbonic

oxide, the introduction of which into dwelling-houses could not be

Aeffected without considerable danger.  more satisfactory mode of

supplying heating separately from illuminating gas would consist in

connecting the retort at different periods of the distillation with two

separate systems of mains for the delivery of the respective gases, as

has been proposed by me elsewhere. Experiments made some years ago

by Mr. ElLisen of the Paris gasworks have shown that the gases rich in

carbon, such as defiant and acetylene, are developed chiefly during an

interval of time beginning half an hour after the commencement and

terminating at half the whole period of distillation, whilst during the

remainder of the time marsh gas and hydrogen are chiefly developed,

which, while possessing little illuminating power, are most advantageous

for heating purposes. By resorting to improved means of heating the

retorts with gaseous fuel, such as have been in use at the Paris gasworks

for a considerable number of years, the length of time for effecting each

distillation may be shortened from six hours, the usual period in former

years, to four, or even three hours, as now practised at Glasgow and else-
where. By this means a given number of retorts can be made to produce,

in addition to the former quantity of illuminating gas of superior quality, a

similar quantity of heating gas, resulting in a diminished cost of production
ADDRESS.  19

and an increased supply of the valuable by-products previously referred

to. The quantity of both ammonia and heating gas may be further

increased by the simple expedient of passing a streamlet of steam through
the heated retorts towards the end of each operation, whereby the
ammonia and hydrocarbons still occluded in the heated coke will be
evolved, and the volume of heating gas produced be augmented by the
products of decomposition of the steam itself. It has been shown that

gas may be used advantageously for domestic purposes with judicious

management even under present conditions, and it is easy to conceive
that its consumption for heating would soon increase, perhaps tenfold, if
supplied separately at, say, Is. a thousand cubic feet. At this price gas
would be not only the cleanest and most convenient, but also the cheapest
form of fuel, and the enormous increase of consumption, the superior
quality of the illuminating gas obtained by selection, and the propor-
tionate increase of by-products, would amply compensate the gas com-
pany or corporation for the comparatively low price of the heating gas.

     The greater efficiency of gas as a fuel results chiefly from the cir-
cumstance that a pound of gas yields in combustion 22,000 heat units,
or exactly double the heat produced in the combustion of a pound of
ordinary coal. This extra heating power is due partly to the freedom
of the gas from earthy constituents, but chiefly to the heat imparted to it
in efiecting its distillation. Recent experiments with gas-burners have
shown that in this direction also there is much room for improvement.

     The amount of light given out by a gas flame depends upon the
temperature to which the particles of solid carbon in the flame are raised,
and Dr. Tyndall has shown that, of the radiant energy set up in such a

flame, only the o^th part is luminous ; the hot products of combustion

carry ofi" at least four times as much energy as is radiated, so that not more

than one hundredth part of the heat evolved in combustion is converted
into light. This proportion could be improved, however, by increasing

the temperature of combustion, which maybe effected either by intensified

air currents or by regenerative action. Supposing that the heat of the
products of combustion could be communicated to metallic surfaces, and
be transferred by conduction or otherwise to the atmospheric air sup-

porting combustion in the flame, we should be able to increase the tem-

perature accumulatively to any point within the limit of dissociation

this limit may be fixed at about 2,300░ C, and cannot be very much
below that of the electric arc. At such a temperature the proportion of

luminous rays to the total heat produced in combustion would certainly be
more than doubled, and the brilliancy of the light would at the same time

be greatly increased. Thus improved, gas-lighting may continue its rivalry

with electric lighting both as regards economy and brilliancy, and such
rivalry must necessarily result in great public advantage.

      In the domestic grate radiant energy of inferior intensity is reqiiired,

and I for one do not agree with those who would like to see the open
fireplace of this country superseded by the continental stove. The

advantages nslially claimed for the open fireplace are, that it is cliecrful,

* pokable,' and conducive to ventilation, but to these may be added another

of even greater importance, viz. that the radiant heat which it emits passes
through the transpai'ent air without warming it, and imparts heat only
to the solid walls, floor, and fui'niture of the room, which are thus con-
stituted the heating surfaces of the comparatively cool air of the apart-
ments in contact with them. In the case of stoves the heated air of
the room causes deposit of moisture upon the walls in heating them,
and gives rise to mildew and germs injurious to health. It is, I think,
owing to this circumstance that upon entering an apartment one can
immediately perceive whether or not it is heated by an open fireplace

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

nor is the unpleasant sensation due to stove-heating completely removed

by mechanical ventilation ; there is, moreover, no good reason why an
open fireplace should not be made as economical and smokeless as a stove

or hot-water apparatus.

In the production of mechanical efiect from heat, gaseous fuel also

pi'esents most striking advantages, as will appear from the following con.

sideration. When we have to deal with the question of converting

mechanical into electrical effect, or vice versa, by means of the dynamo-
electrical machine, we have only to consider what are the equivalent

values of the two forms of energy, and what precautions are necessary to

avoid losses by the electrical resistance of conductors and by friction.

The transformation of mechanical efiect into heat involves no losses, except

those resulting from imperfect installation, and these may be so completely

avoided that Dr. Joule was able by this method to determine the equivalent

values of the two forms of energy. But in attempting the inverse operation,
of efi"ecting the conversion of heat into mechanical energy, we find our-
selves confronted by the second law of thermo-dynamics, which says, that

whenever a given amount of heat is converted into mechanical efiect,

another but variable amount descends from a higher to a lower potential,
and is thus rendered unavailable.

In the condensing steam engine this waste heat comprises that

communicated to the condensing water, whilst the useful heat, or that

converted into mechanical efiect, depends ui3on the diS'erence of tem-

perature between the boiler and condenser. The boiler pressure is

limited, however, by considerations of safety and convenience of con-

struction, and the range of working temperature rarely exceeds 120░ C.

except in the engines constructed by Mr. Perkins, in which a range
of 160░ C, or an expansive action commencing at 14 atmospheres,

has been adopted with considerable success, as appears from an able

report on this engine by Sir Fredei-ick Bramwell. To obtain more ad-
vantageous primary conditions we have to turn to the caloric or gas engine,

mbecause  them the coefficient of efiiciency expressed by  may be

greatly increased. This value would reach a maximum if the initial
                                   ADDRESS.                            21

absolute temperature x could be raised to that of combustion, and t'

reduced to atmospheric temperaturOj and these maximum limits can bo

much more nearly approached in the gas engine, worked by a combustible

mixture of air and hydro-carbons, than in the steam engine.

Assuming, then, in an explosive gas engine a temperature of 1,500░ C.

at a pressure of 4 atmospheres, we should, in accordance with the second

law of thermo-dynamics, find a temperature after expansion to atmospheric

pressure of 600░ C, and therefore a working range of 1500░ - 600░= 900░,

and a theoretical efficiency of    ---- =--'
                                                   about one-half, contrasting

very favourably with that of a good expansive condensing steam engine,

=--in which the range is 150 30 120░ C, and the efSciency    " =^-

                                                                         ^

A good expansive steam engine is therefore capable of yielding as

mechanical work th parts of the heat communicated to the boiler, which
                                                                    -f

does not include the heat lost by imperfect combustion and that
carried away in the chimney. Adding to these the losses by friction and
radiation in the engine, we find that the best steam engine yet con-

structed does not yield in mechanical efi'ect more than |th part of the

heat energy residing in the fuel consumed. In the gas engine we have
also to make reductions from the theoretical efiiciency, on account of the

rather serious loss of heat by absorption into the working cylinder, which
has to be cooled artificially in order to keep its temperature down to a
point at which lubrication is possible ; this, together with frictional loss,
cannot be taken at less than one-half, and reduces the factor of efficiency

of the engine to jth.

     It follows from these considerations that the gas or caloric engine

combines the conditions most favourable to the attainment of maximum
results, and it may reasonably be supposed that the difficulties still in
the way of their application on a large scale will gradually be removed.
Before many years have elapsed we shall find in our factories and on

board our ships engines with a fuel consumption not exceeding 1 pound
of coal per eSective horse power per hour, in which the gas producer takes
the place of the somewhat complex and dangerous steam boiler. The
advent of such an engine and of the dynamo-machine must mark a new

era of material progress at least equal to that produced by the intro-

duction of steam power in the early part of our century. Let us con-

sider what would be the probable eSect of such an engine upon that most

--important interest of this country the merchant navy.

According to returns kindly furnished me by the Board of Trade and

' Lloyds' Register of Shipping,' the total value of the merchant shipping

of the United Kingdom may be estimated at 126,000,000^., of which

90,000,000^.  represent  steamers  having a net tonnage of  3,003,988  tons

and exports, or 500,000,000Z. of goods in the year, and of the more

precious lives connected with it, is a question of paramount importance.

It involves considerations of the most varied kind : comprising the con-

struction of the vessel itself, and the material employed in building it ; its

furniture of engines, pumps, sails, tackle, compass, sextant, and sounding

apparatus, the preparation of reliable charts for the guidance of the

navigator, and the construction of harbours of refuge, lighthouses,

beacons, bells, and buoys, for channel navigation. Yet notwithstanding

the combined efforts of science, inventive skill, and practical experience

the accumulation of centuries--we are startled with statements to the
effect that during last year as many as 1,007 British-owned ships were lost,

of which fully two-thirds were wrecked upon our shores, representing a

total value of nearly 10,000,000Z. Of these ships 870 were sailing vessels

and 137 steamers. The number of sailing vessels included in these

returns being 19,325, and of steamers 5,505, it appears that the steamer

is  the  safer                               vessel,  in  the  proportion  of 4'43  to  3'46                     but  the steamer
                                                                                                              ;

makes on an average three voyages for one of the sailing ship taken over

the year, which reduces the relative risk of the steamer as compared

with the sailing ship per voyage in the proportion of 13-29 to 3"46. Com-

mercially speaking, this large factor of safety in favour of steam- shipping

is to a great extent counterbalanced by the value of the steamship,
which bears to that of the sailing vessel per net carrying ton the pro-

portion of 3 : 1, thus reducing the ratio in favour of steam shipping as
13"29 to 10'38, or in round numbers as 4:3. In testing this result

by the charges of premium for insurance, the variable circumstances

of distance, nature of cargo, season and voyage have to be taken into

account                                      but judging  from  information received from shipowners and
                                          ;

 underwriters of undoubted authority, I find that the relative insurance

 paid for the two classes of vessel represents an advantage of 30 per cent,

m favour of steam- shipping, agreeing very closely with the above de-

 ductions derived from statistical information.

     In considering the question how the advantages thus established in

 favour of steam-shipping could be further improved, attention should be

 called in the first place to the material employed in their construction.

A new material was introduced for this purpose by the Admiralty in

1876, when they constructed at Pembroke dockyard the two steam

corvettes, the Iris and Mercury, of mild steel. The peculiar qualities of
this material are such as to have enabled shipbuilders to save 20 per
cent, in the weight of the ship's hull, and to increase to that extent

its carrying capacity. It combines with a strength 30 per cent,
superior to that of iron, such extreme toughness that in the case of
collision the side of the vessel has been found to yield or bulge several
feet without showing any signs of rupture, a quality affecting the

question of sea risk very favourably. When to the use of this material

there are added the advantages derived from a double bottom and
from the division of the ship's hold by means of bulkheads of solid
ADDRESS.  23

construction, it is difficult to conceive how sucli a vessel could perish by
collision either with another vessel or with a sunken rock. The spaces

between the two bottoms are not lost, because they form convenient
chambers for water ballast, but powerful pumps should in all cases be
added to meet emergencies.

     The following statement of the number and tonnage of vessels building
and preparing to be built in the United Kingdom on the 30th of June last,

which has been kindly furnished me by Lloyds', is of interest as showing

that wooden ships are fast becoming obsolete, and that even iron is
beginning to yield its place, both as regards steamers and sailing ships, to
the new material mild steel ; it also shows that by far the greater number
of vessels now building are ships of large dimensions propelled by engine
power :
24, REPORT-- 1882.

persistent labours of Dr. William B. Carpenter deserve the highest com-
mendation.

     Our knowledge of tidal action has received a most powerful impulse
through the invention of a self-recording gauge and tide-predicter,
which will form the subject of one of the discourses to be delivered
at our present meeting by its principal originator, Sir William Thom-
son ; when I hope he will furnish us with an explanation of some
extraordinary irregularities in tidal records, observed some years ago
by Sir John Coode at Portland, and due apparently to atmospherio

influence.

     The application of iron and steel in naval construction rendered the
use of the compass for some time illusory, but in 1839 Sir George Airy
showed how the errors of the compass, due to the influence experienced

from the iron of the ship, may be perfectly corrected by magnets and soft

iron placed in the neighbourhood of the binnacle ; but the great size of the
needles in the ordinary compasses rendered the correction of the quadrantal

errors practically unattainable. In 1876 Sir William Thomson invented
a compass with much smaller needles than those previously used, which
allows Sir George Airy's pi-inciples to be applied completely. With this

compass correctors can be arranged so that the needle shall point ac-
curately in all directions, and these correctors can be adjusted at sea

from time to time, so as to eliminate any error which may arise through

change in the ship's magnetism or in the magnetism induced by the

earth through change of the shijj's position. By giving the compass card
a long period of free oscillation great steadiness is obtained when the ship

is rolling.

     Sir William Thomson has also eni'iched the art of navigation by the
invention of two sounding machines; the one being devised for ascertaining

great depths very accurately, in less than one-quarter the time formerly
necessary, and the other for taking depths up to 130 fathoms without
stopping the ship in its onward course. In both these instruments steel

pianoforte wire is used instead of the hempen or silken lines formerly
employed ; in the latter machine the record of depth is obtained not
by the quantity of wire run over its counter and brake wheel, but through
the indications produced upon a simple pressure gauge consisting of an
inverted glass tube, whose internal surface is covered beforehand with
a preparation of chromate of silver, rendered colourless by the sea-water
up to the height to which it penetrates. The value of this instrument for
guiding the navigator within what he calls ' soundings ' can hardly be
exaggerated ; with the sounding machine and a good chart he can generally
make out his position correctly by a succession of three or four casts in
a given direction at given intervals, and thus in foggy weather is made
independent of astronomical observations and of the sight of lighthouses

or the shore. By the proper use of this apparatus, accidents such as

happened to the mail steamer Mosel, not a fortnight ago, would not be
possible. As regards the value of the deep-sea instrument I can
ADDRESS,  25

speak from personal experience ; on one occasion it enabled tbose in
charge of the cable s.s. Faraday to find the end of an Atlantic cable,
which had parted in a gale of wind, with no other indication of the

locality than a single sounding, giving a depth of 950 fathoms. To
recover the cable a number of soundings in the supposed neighbourhood
of the broken end were taken, the 950 fathom contour line was then
traced upon a chart, and the vessel thereupon trailed its grapnel two
miles to the eastward of this line, when it soon engaged the cable
20 miles away from the point where dead reckoning had placed the

ruptured end.

     Whether or not it will ever be practicable to determine oceanic depths
without a sounding line, by means of an instrument based upon gravi-

metric differences, remains to be seen. Hitherto the indications obtained
by such an instrument have been encouraging, but its delicacy has been

such as to unfit it for ordinary use on board a ship when rolling.

    The time allowed me for addressing you on this occasion is wholly

insufficient to do justice to the great engineering works of the present
day, and I must therefore limit myself to making a short allusion to a few
only of the more remarkable enterprises.

     The great success, both technically and commercially, of the Suez
Canal, has stimulated M. de Lesseps to undertake a similar work of even
jiore gigantic proportions, namely, the piercing of the Isthmus of
Panama by a ship canal, 40 miles long, 50 yards wide on the surface,
and 20 yards at the bottom, upon a dead level from sea to sea. The
estimated cost of this work is 20,000,000Z., and, more than this sum

having been subscribed, it appears unlikely that political or climatic
difficulties will stop M. de Lesseps in its speedy accomplishment.
Through it, China, Japan, and the whole of the Pacific coasts will be
brought to half their present distance, as measured by the length of
voyage, and an impulse to navigation and to progress will be given
which it will be difficult to over-estimate.

     Side by side with this gigantic work. Captain Eads, the successful
improver of the Mississippi navigation, intends to erect his ship railway, to
take the largest vessels, fully laden and equipped, from sea to sea, over a
gigantic railway across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, a distance of 95
miles. Mr. Barnaby, the chief constructor of the navy, and Mr. John
Fowler have expressed a favourable opinion regarding this enterprise,
and it is to be hoped that both the canal and the ship railway will be

accomplished, as it may be safely anticipated that the ti'affio will be

amply sufficient to support both these undertakings.

effect the third great enterprise with which his name has been promi-

nently connected, the flooding of the Tunis-Algerian Chotts, thei-eby

accurate surveys ; but the beneficial influence of a large sheet of water
within the African desert could hardly be matter of doubt.

     It is with a feeling not unmixed with regret that I have to record
the completion of a new Eddystone Lighthouse, in substitution for the
chef-cVwuvre of engineering erected by John Smeaton more than 100
years ago. The condemnation of that structure was not, however, the
consequence of any fault of construction, but was caused by inroads of
the sea upon the rock supporting it. The new lighthouse, designed and
executed by Mr., now Sir, James Douglass, engineer of Trinity House,
has been erected in the incredibly short time of less than two years, and
bids fair to be worthy of its famed predecessor. Its height above high
water is 130 feet, as compared with 72 feet (the height of Smeaton's
structure), which gives its powerful light a considerably increased range.
The system originally suggested by Sir William Thomson some years ago,
of distinguishing one light from another by flashes following at varied
intervals, has been adopted by the Elder Brethren in this as in other
recent lights in the modified form introduced by Dr. John Hopkinson, in
which the principle is applied to revolving lights, so as to obtain a
greater amount of light in the flash.

     The geological difliculties which for some time threatened the accom-
plishment of the St. Gothard Tunnel have been happily overcome, and
this second and most important sub-Alpine thoroughfare now connects
the Italian railway system with that of Switzerland and the south of
Germany, whereby Genoa will be constituted the shipping port for those

parts.

     Whether we shall be able to connect the English with the French
I'ailway system by moans of a tunnel below the English Channel is
a question that appears dependent, at this moment, rather upon military
and political than technical and financial considerations. The occurrence

of a stratum of impervious grey chalk, at a convenient depth below the
bed of the Channel, minimises the engineering difficulties in the way, and
must influence the financial question involved. The protest lately raised
against its accomplishment can hardly be looked upon as a public verdict,
but seems to be the result of a natural desire to pause, pending the institu-

tion of careful inquiries. Such inquiries have lately been made by a Royal
scientific Commission, and will be referred for further consideration to a
mixed Parliamentary Committee, upon whose Report it must depend

whether the natural spirit of commercial enterprise has to yield in this

instance to political and military considerations. Whether the Channel
Tunnel is constructed or not, the plan proposed some years ago by Mr.
John Fowler of connecting England and France by means of a ferry boat
capable of taking railway trains would be a desideratum justified by the
ever-increasing intercommunication between this and Continental countries.

      The public inconvenience arising through the obstruction to traffic
by a sheet of water is well illustrated by the circumstance that both
the estuaries of the Severn and of the Mersey are being undermined in

order to connect the railway systems on the two sides, and that the
Frith of Forth is about to be spanned by a bridge exceeding in grandeur
anything as yet attempted by the engineer. The roadway of this bridge
will stand 150 feet above high- water mark, and its two principal
spans will measure a third of a statute mile each. Messrs. Fowler and

Baker, the engineers to whom this great work has been entrusted, could

hardly accomplish their task without having recourse to steel for their
material of construction, nor need the steel used be of the extra mild

quality particularly applicable for naval structures to withstand collision,

for, when such extreme toughness is not required, steel of very homo-

geneous quality can be produced, bearing a tensile strain fully double

that of iron.

     The tensile strength of steel, as is well known, is the result of an ad-
mixture of carbon with the iron, varying between -j^th and 2 per cent., and

the nature of this combination of carbon with iron is a matter of great
interest both from a theoretical and practical point of view. It could

not be a chemical compound which would necessitate a definite propor-
tion, nor could a mere dissolution of the one in the other exercise such

remarkable influence upon the strength and hardness of the resulting

Ametal.  recent investigation by Mr. Abel has thrown considerable

Alight upon this question.  definite carbide of iron is formed, it appears,

soluble at high temperatures in iron, but separating upon cooling the

steel gradually, and influencing only to a moderate degree the physical
properties of the metal as a whole. In cooling rapidly there is no time
for the carbide to separate from the iron, and the metal is thus rendered
both hard and brittle. Cooling the metal gradually under the influence
of great compressive force, appears to have a similar effect to rapid
cooling in preventing the separation of the carbide from the metal,
with this difference, that the effect is more equal throughout the mass,

and that more uniform temper is likely to result.

    When the British Association met at Southampton on a former

occasion, Schonbein announced to the world his discovery of gun-cotton.

This discovery has led the way to many valuable researches on explosives

generally, in which Mr. Abel has taken a leading part. Recent investiga-

tions by him, in connection with Captain Noble, upon the explosive action
of gun-cotton and gunpowder confined in a strong chamber, (which have
not yet been published), deserve particular attention. They show that
while by the method of investigation pursued about twenty years ago by
Karolye (of exploding gunpowder in very small charges in shells con-
fined within a large shell partially exhausted of air), the composition of
the gaseous products was found to be complicated and liable to variation,
the chemical metamorphosis which gun-cotton sustains, when exploded
under conditions such as obtain in its practical application, is simple and

very uniform. Among other interesting points noticed in this direction

was the fact that, as in the case of gunpowder, the proportion of
carbonic acid increases',) while that of carbonic oxide diminishes with
28 EEPOET-- 1882.

the density of the charge. The explosion of gun-cotton, whether in

the form of wool or loosely spun thread, or in the packed compressed

form devised by Abel, furnished practically the same results if fired

--under pressure, that is, under strong confinement the conditions being

favourable   to  the  full  development                                                       of its  explosive  force but                       some
                                                                                                                                              ;

marked differences in the composition of the products of metamorphosis

were observed when gun-cotton was fired by detonation. With regard to

the tension exerted by the jji'oducts of explosion, some interesting points

were observed, wliich introduce very considerable difficulties into the

investigation of the action of fired gun-cotton. Thus whereas no marked

differences are observed in the tension developed by small charges and by

very much larger charges of gunpowder having the same density (i.e.

occupying the same volume relatively to the entire space in which they

are exploded) the I'everse is the case with respect to gun-cotton. Under

similar conditions in regard to density of charge, 100 gi'ammes of gun-

cotton gave a measured tension of about 20 tons on the square inch,

1,500 grammes gave a tension of about 29 tons (in several very con-

cordant observations), while a charge of 2'5 kilos gave a pressure of

about 4.5 tons, this being the maximum measured tension obtained with

a charge of gunpowder of five times the density of the above.

The extreme violence of the explosion of gun-cotton as compared with

gunpowder when fired in a closed space was a feature attended with

formidable difficulties. In whatever way the charge was arranged in the

firing cylinder, if it had free access to the inclosed crusher gauge, the

pressures recoi'ded by the latter were always much greater than Avhen

means were taken to prevent the wave of matter suddenly set in motion

from acting directly upon the gauge. The abnormal or wave-pressures

recorded at the same time that the general tension in the cylinder was

measured amounted in the experiment to 42'3 tons, when the general

tension was recorded  at 20 tons                                                         and  in another, when the pressure was
                                                                                      ;

measured at 29 tons, the wave-pressure recorded was 44 tons. Measure-

ments of the temperature of explosion of gun-cotton showed it to be about

double that of the explosion of gunpowder. One of the effects observed

to be produced by this sudden enormous development of heat was the

covering of the inner surfaces of the steel explosion-vessel with a network

of cracks, small portions of the surface being sometimes actually fractured.

The explosion of charges of gun-cotton up to 2'5 kilos in perfectly closed

chambers, with development of pressures approaching to 50 tons on the

square inch, constitutes alone a perfectly novel feat in investigations of

this class.

Messrs. Noble and Abel are also continuing their researches upon fired

gunpowder, being at present occupied with an inquiry into the influence
exerted upon the chemical metamorphosis and ballistic effects of fired
gunpowder by variation in its composition, their attention being directed

especially to the discovery of the cause of the more or less considerable

--prosion of the interior surface of guns pi'oduced by the exploding charge
an effect wlilcb, notwitbstanding the application of devices in the building
up of the charge specially directed to the preservation of the gun's bore,

have become so serious that, with the enormous charges now iised in our

heavy guns, the erosive action on the surface of the bore produced by a

single round is distinctly perceptible. As there appeared to be primii
facie reasons why the erosive action of powder upon the surface of the

bore, at the high temperatures developed, should bo at any rate in part due
to its one component sulphur, Noble and Abel have made comparative
experiments with powders of the usual composition and with otters in
which the proportion of sulphur was considerably increased, the extent of
erosive action of the products escaping from the explosion vessel under

high tension being carefully determined. With small charges a particular
powder containing no sulphur was found to exert very little erosive action
as compared with ordinary cannon powder ; but another powder, contain-
ing the maximum proportion of sulphur tried (15 per cent.), was found
equal to it under these conditions, and exerted very decidedly less erosive
action than it, when larger charges were reached. Other important con-
tributions to our knowledge of the action of fired gunpowder in guns, as
well as decided improvements in the gunpowder manufactured for the
very heavy ordnance of the present day, may be expected to result from a

continuance of these investigations. Professor Carl Himly, of Kiel, having
 been engaged upon investigations of a similar nature, has lately pi'oposeda
 gunpowder in which hydrocarbons (precipitated from solution in naphtha)
take the place of the charcoal and sulphur of ordinary powder; this
powder has amongst others the peculiar property of completely resisting

the action of water, so that the old caution, ' Keep your powder dry,' may

 hereafter be unnecessary.

      The extraordinary difference of condition, before and after its ignition,
 of such matter as constitutes an exjDlosive agent, leads us up to a con-
 sideration of the aggregate state of matter under other circumstances.
 As early as 1776 Alexander Volta observed that the volume of glass was
 changed under the influence of electrification, by what he termed electrical
 pressure. Dr. Kerr, Govi, and others have followed up the same inquiry,
 which is at present continued chiefly by Dr. George Quincke, of Heidel-
 berg, who finds that temperature, as well as chemical constitution of the
 dielectric under examination, exercises a detei'mining influence upon the
 amount and character of the change of volume effected by electrification ;

 that the change of volume may under certain circumstances be effected

 instantaneously as in flint glass, or only slowly as in crown glass, and
 that the elastic limit of both is diminished by electrification, whereas in
 the case of mica and of guttapercha an increase of elasticity takes place.

      Still greater strides are being made at the present time towards a clearer
 pei'ception of the condition of matter when particles are left some liberty

 to obey individually the forces brought to bear upon them. By the dis-

 charge of high tension electricity through tubes containing highly rarefied
--30 REPORT 1882.

gases (Geissler's tubes), phenomena of discharge were produced whicli

were at once most striking and suggestive. The Sprengel pump afforded

a means of pushing the exhaustion to limits which had formerly been
scarcely reached by the imagination. At each step, the condition of
attenuated matter revealed varying properties, when acted upon by elec-
trical discharge and magnetic force. The radiometer of Crookes imported
a new feature into these inquiries, which at the present time occupy tho

attention of leading physicists in all countries.

     The means usually employed to produce electrical discharge in vacuum
tubes was Ruhmkorff's coil ; but Mr. Gassiot first succeeded in obtaining
the phenomena by means of a galvanic battery of 3,000 Leclanche cells.
Dr. De La Rue, in conjunction with his friend Dr. Hugo Miiller, has gone

far beyond his predecessors in the production of batteries of high potential.

At his lecture ' On the Phenomena of Electric Discharge,' delivered at
the Royal Institution in January 1881, he employed a battery of his own

invention consisting of 14,400 cells (14,832 Volts), which gave a current
of 0'054 Ampere, and produced a discharge at a distance of 0'71 inch
between the terminals. During last year he increased the number of
cells to 15,000 (15,450 Volts), and increased the current to 0-4 Ampere,
or eight times that of the battery he used at the Royal Institution.

    With the enormous potential and perfectly steady current at his dis-
posal, Mr. De La Rue has been able to contribute many interesting facts
to the science of electricity. He has shown, for example, that the beautiful
phenomena of the stratified discharge in exhausted tubes are but a modi-

fication and a magnification of those of the electric arc at ordinary atmo-
spheric pressure. Photography was used in his experiments to record the
appearance of the discharge, so as to give a degree of precision otherwise

unattainable in the comparison of the phenomena. He has shown that

between two points the length of the spark, provided the insulation of the
battery is efficacious, is as the square of the number of cells employed.

Mr. De La Rue's expei-iments have proved that at all pressures the

discharge in gases is not a current in the ordinary acceptation of the

term, but is of the nature of a disruptive discharge. Even in an appa-
rently perfectly steady dischai^ge in a vacuum tube, when the strata as
seen in a rapidly revolving mirror are immovable, he has shown that
the discharge is a pulsating one ; but, of course, the period must be of a

very high order.

     At the Royal Institution, nn the occasion of his lecture, he pro-
duced, in a very large vacuum tube, an imitation of the Aurora Borealis ;

and he has deduced from his experiments that the greatest brilliancy
of Aurora displays must be at an altitude of from thirfcy-seven to

--thirty-eight miles a conclusion of the highest interest, and in opposi-

tion to the extravagant estimate of 281 miles, at which it had been pre-

viously put.

     The President of the Royal Society has made the phenomena of elec-

trical discharge his study for several years, and resorted in his important
                                                                   ADDRESS.                                                                                                                            31

experiments to a special source of electric power. In a note addressed

to me, Dr. Spottiswoode describes the nature of Lis investigations much

more clearly than I could venture to give them. He says : ' It had
long been my opinion that the dissymmetry, shown in electrical discharges

through rarefied gases, must be an essential element of every disruptive

discharge, and that the phenomena of stratification might be regarded

as magnified images of features always present, but concealed under

ordinary circumstances. It was with a view to the study of this ques-

tion that the researches by Moulton and myself were undertaken. The

method chiefly used consisted in introducing into the circuit intermittence

of a particular kind, whereby one luminous discharge was rendered

sensitive to the approach of a conductor outside the tube. The applica-

tion of this method enabled us to produce artificially a variety of pheno-

Wemena, including that of stratification.                                     were thus led to a series of

conclusions relating to the mechanism of the discharge, among which

the following may be mentioned :

' 1. That a stria, with its attendant dark space, forms a physical unit

of a striated discharge ; that a striated column is an aggregate of such

units formed   by means of                                    a    step-by-step j^rocess                                                                                           and that the  negative
                                                                                                                                                                                ;

glow is merely a localised stria, modified by local circumstances.

' 2. That the origin of the luminous column is to be sought for at its

negative  end that                                       the  luminosity is   an expression                                                                                        of  a demand for
                                ;

negative electricity ; and that the dark spaces are those regions where

the negative terminal, whether metallic or gaseous, is capable of exerting

sufficient influence to prevent such demand.

' 3. That the time occupied by electricity of either name in traversing

tube is greater than that occupied in traversing an equal length of wire,

but less than that occupied by molecular streams (Crookes' radiations) in

traversing the tubes. Also that, especially in high vacua, the discharge

from the negative terminal exhibits a durational character not found at

the positive.

' 4. That the brilliancy of the light with so little heat may be due in

part to brevity in the duration of the discharge ; and that for action so

rapid as that of individual discharges, the mobility of the medium may

count as  nothing                                        and that  for these  infinitesimal                                                                                        iieriods  of  time  gas
                                                      ;

may itself be as rigid and as brittle as glass.

' 5. That strise are not merely loci in which electrical is converted into

luminous energy, but are actual aggregations of matter.

     ' This last conclusion was based mainly upon experiments made with

--an induction coil excited in a new way viz. directly by an alternating

machine, without the intervention of a commutator or condenser. This
mode of excitement promises to be one of great importance in spectro-

scopic work, as well as in the study of the discharge in a magnetic field,

partly on account of the simplification which it permits in the construction

of induction coils, but mainly on account of the very great increase of

strength in the secondary currents to which it gives rise.'
--32 EEPORT 1882.

    These investigations Sssume additional importance wten we vidW

-- --them in connection with solar I may even say stellar physics, for evi-

dence is augmenting in favour of the view that interstellar space is not

empty, but is filled with highly attenuated matter of a nature such as

may be put into our vacuum tubes. Nor can the matter occupying

stellar space be said any longer to be beyond our reach for chemical and
physical test. The spectroscope has already thrown a flood of light upon
the chemical constitution and physical condition of the sun, the stars, the

comets, and the far distant nebulte, which latter have yielded spectro-

scopic photographs under the skilful management of Dr. Huggins, and

Dr. Draper of New York. Armed with greatly improved apparatus the

physical astronomer has been able to reap a rich harvest of scientific

information during the short periods of the last two solar eclipses ; that

of 1879, visible in America, and that of May last, observed in Egypt

by Lockyer, Schuster, and by Continental observers of high standing.
The result of this last eclijjsc expedition has been summed up as follows :

* Different temperature levels have been discovered in the solar atmo-

sphere ; the constitution of the corona has now the possibility of being

Adetermined, and it is proved to shine with its own light.     suspicion

has been aroused once more as to the existence of a lunar atmosphere,

and the position of an important line has been discovered. Hydro-carbons

do not exist close to the sun, but may in space between us and it.'
    To me personally these reported results possess peculiar interest, for

in March last I ventured to bring before the Royal Society a speculation

regarding the conservation of solar energy, which was based upon the

three following postulates, viz. :

1. That aqueous vapour and carbon compounds are present in stellar

or interplanetary space.

2. That these gaseous compounds are capable of being dissociated by

radiant solar energy while in a state of extreme attenuation.

3. That the effect of solar rotation is to draw in dissociated vapours

upon the polar surfaces, and to eject them after combustion back into

space equatorially.

It is therefore a matter of peculiar gratification to me that the results

of observation here recorded give considerable support to that speculation.

The luminous equatorial extensions of the sun which the American ob-

servations revealed in such a striking manner (with which I was not

acquainted when writing my paper) were absent in Egypt; bat the

outflowing equatorial streams (I suppose to exist) could only be rendered

visible by reflected sunlight, or by electric discharge when mixed with

dust produced by exceptional solar disturbances; and the occasional

appearance of such luminous extensions would serve only to disprove

the hypothesis entertained by some, that they are divided planetary
matter, in which case their appearance should be permanent. Professor
Langley, of Pittsburg, has shown by means of his bolometer, that the

solar actinic rays are absorbed chiefly in the solar instead of in the
       ADDRESS.  33

terrestrial atmosphere, and Captain Abney has found, by his new

photometric method, that absorption, due to hydro-carbons, takes place
somewhere between the solar and terrestrial atmosphere. In order to test
this interesting result still further, he has lately taken his apparatus to the
top of the RifFel with a view of diminishing the amount of terrestrial
atmospheric air between it and the sun, and intends to bring a paper on
this subject befoi-e Section A. Stellar space filled with such matter as
hydro-carbon and aqueous vapour would establish a material continuity
between the sun and his planets, and between the innumerable solar
systems of which the universe is composed. If chemical action and

reaction can further be admitted, we may be able to trace certain con-
ditions of thermal dependence and maintenance, in which we may

recognise principles of high perfection, applicable also to comparatively

humble purposes of human life.

   We shall thus find that in the great workshop of nature there are no

lines of demai'cation to be drawn between the most exalted speculation
and commonplace practice, and that all knowledge must lead up to one
great result, that of an intelligent recognition of the Creator through His
works. So then, we members of the British Association and fellow-
workers in every branch of science may exhort one another in the words
of the American bard who has so lately departed from amongst us :

                                         Let VIS then be up and doing,
                                          With a heart for any fate

                                               Still achieving, still pursuing,

                                            Learn to labour and to wait.

Report of the Comniittee, consisting of Professor Sylvester, Pro-
   fessor Cayley, a7id the Eev. Gteorge Salmon, D.D., appointed in

   connection with the Calculation of Tables of Fundamental In-
   variants of Binary Quantics.

It has been thought advisable to extend the calculation of tables of
invai-iants (proper) to ternary systems of binary quantics, and the follow-
ing systems have been selected for the purpose.

    Two quadrics and a quartic ; a quadric and two quartics ; three

quartics : a quadi'ic, cubic, and quartic : say the systems (2) (2) (4) ;

(2) (4) (4); (4) (4) (4); (2) (3) (4).

    By far the most considerable amount of the work belongs to the cal-

culations connected with the last-named system.

     The entire work covers 52 sheets of paper of dimensions 31 in. by 23
in., divided into 93x69, i.e. 6417 ^rd-inch squares, each enclosing one
numerical coefficient ; the total number of such spaces, of which only a

moderately small fraction remains vacant, being accordingly 333,684.

     The work of compilation was actually performed by Messrs. Healy
and Durfee (fellows), under the able superintendence of Dr. F. Franklin

--(associate) of the Johns Hopkins University who is of opinion that

at least nine-tenths of the labour and time that would otherwise have been
required for the calculations has been saved by the method of operation
above indicated : a method called by its presumable inventor or originator,
Professor Sylvester, the method of cage-work or occlusion, which has
also been found by Dr. Franklin applicable with very considerable
advantage to certain operose astronomical computations with which he
has been entrusted in connection with one of the public departments in
Washington.

     The leading results will be published in the ' American Journal of
Mathematics ' in a form similar to that of the tables of like kind, calcu-
lated at the expense of the British Association, which have already
appeared there.

      It is sufficient for present purposes to state that the fundamental in-
variants (the absolute constant not included) for the systems (2) (2) (4) ;
(2) (4) (4) ; (4) (4) (4) ; (2) (3) (4) are respectively 19, 29, 25 and
04 in number ; the first, second, and fourth of these totals, viz. 19,
29, 64, it will be noticed, are very nearly the same as the numbers of
invariants of the systems (1) (2) (4) ; (1) (4) (4) ; (1) (3) (4) which
are, as is well known, identical with the numbers 18, 28, 61, of the in-
and CO- variants belonging to the quadri-quartic, quarto- quartic, and cnbo-
quartic systems respectively.

    It may also be stated that the invariants of the three systems in which

only quadrics or qnartics are contained are all unique for a given type
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

that is, in each of the three systems there is never more than a single

invariant of given degrees in the coefficients of the three constituent
quantics resjpectively.

Report {'provisional) of the Committee, consisting of Mr. Robert

   H. Scott {Secretary), Mr. J. Norman Lockyer, Professor H. J. S.
   Smith, Professor Gr. Gr. Stokes, Professor Balfour Stewart, and

   Mr. Gr. J. Symons, appointed for tlie jpurpose of co-operating
   with the Meteorological Society of the Mauritius in their pro-
   posed publication of Daily Synoptic Charts of the Indian Ocean

  from the year 1861.

The Committee have no report to submit, for it appears from the latest
letters received from Dr. Meldrum that the actual printing ofi" of the pro-
posed Synoptic Charts for the Indian Ocean has not yet been com-

menced.

    No expense has therefore been incurred as yet, and there has been no

occasion to apply for any portion of the grant of 50Z. made at the York

meeting.
     However, the Meteorological Society of the Mauritius contemplates

the issue of the charts in the course of the coming year, so that the

Committee request that they may be re-appointed, and the grant re-

newed.

Report on Recent Progress in Hydrodynamics.

               By W. IM. Hicks, M.A.

                  Part II. Special Problems.

This second part of tlie report will deal with matters of more purely

mathematical interest than the first, and will chiefly comprise the con-

=sideration of those particular solutions of the equation ^-(j) o, which

satisfy conditions given over the boundaries of various surfaces, and the

determination of the effective inertia of the surrounding fluid when

solids of diSerent forms move in it. The problems here considered may

be regarded in different lights, according as the investigator has

accustomed himself to think from a hydrodynamical, an electrical, or a

conduction of heat point of view. Consequently, it will be found that

several of the hydrodynamical solutions will bo found in papers with

electrical or other titles. In the following the motion of a perfect

fluid in (a) two and (6) three dimensions, and (c) of a viscous fluid, will

be taken in order, the latter from a mathematical standpoint, without

reference to the experimental researches which have been carried out by

a large number of investigators. But, before passing on, it may be well

here to add a few remarks in the way of correction or addition to the

first part of the Report published last year.

    Professor Larmor has drawn my attention to the fact that the theory

of the ignoration of co-ordinates, mentioned on page 60, is essentially

due to Ronth, who gave the complete theory in his Adams' prize essay

'On the Stability of Motion' (p. 60). The application of the theory to
fluid motion is due to Thomson and Tait. The statement on p. 65,

* that the circulation round any closed curve in the fluid is equal to twice

the surface integral of the resolved part of the vortices perpendicular to

the surface over any surface whose boundary is the curve,' is a theorem

due to Thomson, is not correct. Beltrami и states that Hankel gave the

theorem in 1861,  in a paper ^ which I have not  been  able  to  obtain                                but
                                                                                                    ;

it seems to have been given by Stokes, in 1854, in a Smith's prize ^ paper

for that year. This would, therefore, appear to be the first publication.

In the consideration of viscosity on p. 81 a notice of a paper by

Helmholtz ' ought to have been given, in which he proves two general

theorems. These are that, if squares and products of the velocity be

neglected, and if the fluid be not supposed to glide over the surfaces of

bodies immersed in it, then, (1) if the motion be steady, the currents in

the viscous fluids are so distributed that the loss of energy due to

viscosity is a minimum, on the supposition that the velocities along the

boundaries of the fluid are given ; and (2) a floating body is in equi-

librium in a viscous fluid flowing with slow steady motion, if the loss is

also a minimum, when the velocities of the fluid along the surface of the

possible motions.

On the same page it should be noted that the theory of similitude

given by Helmholtz had already, more than twenty years before, been

stated by Stokes,' though not so fully as to include different coefficients
of gliding over the surfaces of bodies immersed. The applications by

Helmholtz are new.

  --Sources and SinJcs. The simplest motion possible is that where fluid

moves in an infinite plane, streaming from certain points (sources) and
into others (sinks). Its importance consists in this, that all potential

functions can be considered as due to certain distributions of sources or
sinks at definite points, or along certain lines and surfaces, as has been
shown by Stokes.^ Regarded from this point of view they have been

called the ' Green's functions of the given distribution of matter.' Many
examples will occur in the succeeding pages of their application. W. R.

Smith ^ has developed some of the general properties of the stream-linos
and equipotential lines for two dimensional motion when the number of

singular points is finite and all are of the same magnitude. When the

system is complete, i.e. when the numbers of sources and sinks are equal,

the degrees of both the stream-lines and equipotential lines are equal to

the whole number of singular points. When the numbers are unequal

this is still true for the stream-lines, but the degree of the equipotential

line is double the greater number. The general nature of the lines is
clearly different, according as the system is complete or not. In the
former case one stream-line goes to infinity, and is, at most, of a degree
one less than the number of singular points, whilst if the system be not
complete, eveiy complete stream-line has a number of asymptotes equal
to the difference of the numbers of sources and sinks. More jjarticularly
he considers the cases of two, three, and four singular points, and gives
figures when they are at the corners of a rectangle and of a regular
trapezium. Cases of the same kind have also been noticed by Kirchhoff "^

from the electrical point of view.

As sources and sinks may be regarded as the origin of all non-cyclic

motion, so may the vortex-filament bo looked upon as the basis for cyclic

motion. The cases of one or two vortices, discovered by Helmholtz,

have been already referred to.^ When more than two are present the

general treatment of their motions involves mathematical difficulties of

calculation, though the theory is quite straightforward. Particular cases

have been worked out with much detail by W. Grobli''' (1877), in a

paper which has much interest from the number of figures it contains
illustrating the paths in certain cases. He considers the cases (1) of

three vortices (Ф) equal, but one of different sign from the other two,
(/3) equal and of the same sign, (y) two equal and opposite and double the
third ; also the conditions that they shall always lie at the angles of a

triangle (o) of constant size and form, (e) of constant form (4) with two
--equal sides
                                                           ;
(2) of four equal vortices with a plane of symmetry           which

comes to the same thing as two equal vortices in an infinite fluid

bounded by a plane ; and (3) of 2n equal vortices with n planes of
symmetry, or one vortex in the fluid bounded by two planes inchned

at an angle win. In this last case each describes the Cotes' spiral,

=r sin nd const. It would lead us too far to describe more fully the

results arrived at, which, after all, are only particular cases of the

general problem. The last question has also been discussed by Green-

hill^ (1878), who shows that a vortex of strength m, in an angle w/n,

will describe its Cotes' spiral as if it were a particle under the attraction

of a force varying inversely as the cube of the distance from the angle,

The theory of the fluid motions resulting when portions of planes are

held in a stream has been referred to in the last report,^ and it will be

sufficient here to give for reference the cases already solved. The case of

fluid flowing from an infinite space into a canal bounded by two parallel

planes is historically the most interesting, being the first example of dis-

continuous motion which yielded to the genius of Helmholtz.* The only

other solutions at present known are those discovered by Kirchhoff.^

These reduce to special cases of the two general jn-oblems (1) where fluid
issues from between two straight lines drawn in any direction from two

points, and (2) where a straight line is opposed in a stream of fluid at any
angle. The solution of the equation of continuity for all the space outside

a line can be deduced from the case of the ellipse referred to below. It

is of importance from an electrical point of view, but is only of purely

mathematical interest as far as hydrodynamics is concerned.

Passing on now to spaces bounded by straight lines, we have to notice

the cases of two parallel lines, triangles, and rectangles. Sources and

sinks between parallel planes have been discussed by the writer, but they

may be regarded as limiting cases of the rectangle, which is referred to
below. When the triangle is equilateral, the motion for a rotation was

discovered by F. D. Thomson,' and Stokes^ has shown that for this the

effective moment of inertia of the equivalent solid is two-fifths of that of

the solidified fluid. The potential and stream functions for a vortex inside

Buch a triangle have been given by Greenhill,^ and the path described by

the vortex, also the same functions when there is a source at one corner

and a sink at the other. For the right-angled isosceles triangle the case

for a source and sink at the base angles have been given by the writer,''

and are, I believe, the only ones solved for this triangle. If the vertex of

a triangle move off to infinity jierpendicular to the base, we get the space

bounded on three sides by two infinite parallel lines, and a third line per-

pendicular to them. The potential and stream function for a source, or a

vortex (electric point) in such a space are given in the same paper, as well

as figures illustrating them in particular cases. This may be regarded as

a limiting case of the rectangle, to which we now proceed.

   This form has received much attention from the time when Stokes^

first discussed it in ] 843. He determined the velocity potential for the

internal motion when the boundary rotates, in the form of an infinite series,

and in the same form evaluated the moment of inertia of the equivalent

solid. His method is based on determining the coefficients of an infinite

series to represent the motion of rotation of two opposite sides when the

other pair are at rest, and then combining them for the whole motion.

The same problem is considered in * Thomson and Tait's Natural Philo-

sophy.' ^ Ferrers^ (1878) attacks the question differently. He first

shows that if the density of matter at every part of a plane be given by

+ Nowmxp cos
            cos vy, its potential is 4<7rp cos vix cos ny /(m^ n^).                                                                                              the

analytical conditions for the stream function of the motion of fluid in a

rotating rectangle are the same as for the potential for a distribution of

+ --matter of density 1, and 1, in alternate equal rectangles. This

density is expressed as the product of two Fourier's series, and the before-

mentioned theorem applied. Greenhill* (1878) gives expressions for the

velocities at any point in a very compact form as definite integrals of

Hecertain elliptic functions of the position of the point.                                                                                             arrives at this

1*08016 by taking tlie series for the velocity and stream functions given
in Thomson and Tait, and expressing the series for the velocities derived
from them in the above way. The upper limits of the integrals are the
co-ordinates of the point. Definite integral expressions, with constant
limits for the velocity and stream functions, and the velocities, have
been determined by myself,' by taking the values of these functions for
a source inside a rectangle, and distributing sources and sinks over the
sides of the rectangle, proportional to the normal motion of the boundary

at the point.

The two functions for a source inside a rectangle were first (1865)

determined by Jochmann^ by summation of the corresponding functions

for the whole set of images of the source. They depend in general on the

Theta functions, and for particular positions take simple forms. The same

problem for vortices has been solved by Greenhill,^ who has also found

the equation to the path of a single vortex inside the boundary. The

form is so simple that I venture to reproduce it here. If the origin be at

Kthe centre, and if : K' be the ratio of the sides, the equation to the path
+ =of a vortex is ctn2(Ka;/a., Zc) ctji^(K'y jb, h') const, whilst, if the vortex

=is at the centre, the stream-lines are cn(K,i;/a, h) cn(K'7//6, Jc') tanh>^/m.

  --The Circle. This naturally was amongst one of the first boundaries

for which the velocity potential was fonnd. It was given by Stokes* in

1843 as a particular case of the general motion of the surfaces of two

concentric circles, and he showed that the mass of the equivalent solid

Awas equal to that of the fluid displaced.  very full discussion of the

motion of the particles of the fluid, by Clerk-Maxwell,^ will be found in

the ' Proceedings ' of the Mathematical Society, a discussion which is ren-

dered all the more insti'uctive from the figures which accompany it. Both

these papers treat of non-cyclic motion ; but the space in two dimensions

about a circle being cyclic, admits of a many-valued velocity potential.

Rayleigh ^ and Greenhill ^ have shown that when there is a cyclic motion

about the circle it will itself move in a circle in the same direction as that

motion, whilst the latter has shown that if it also moves under the action

of gravity it will describe a trochoid. The image of a source in a circle

--has long been known, and that of a vortex is a natural corollary.
    Two Circles. This is another boundary for which we owe the first

discussion to Stokes^ (1843). He considered them concentric, with any

general motion of the points of the surface, and in particular for the

initial motion, when one circle has a motion of translation. He shows

that in this case, which serves very approximately to determine the small

vibration under gravity of the inner circle, the mass of the equivalent

+ --solid is (5^ a.^)/(6^ a^) times the mass of the flaid displaced ; a, b

being the radii of the circles. I ' have discussed the most general motion

of two circles, either internal, or external to one another, treating the

two cases separately where the circles touch or not. The velocity and

potential functions are given for any motion of the two circles, and the

following particular cases are considered more in detail : (a) the motion

of a pendulum inside a circular case, (/3) of a circle in fluid bounded by a

straight line, (y) of two circles rigidly connected, (I) the motion of one

when the other is fixed, and lastly (e) some properties of the general

motion of two free circles, in all cases without cyclic motion. It may be

interesting to give some of the results, which admit of quantitative de-

termination in finite terms. If (as in /3) a circle be projected from con-

tact with the boundary line, in a direction perpendicular to it, the limiting

velocity as it moves off to an infinite distance is increased in the ratio

+ -- +(jTT- () 1)- (p l)""'- If it be projected from any point, the future

path will have its concavity turned towards the plane, and will turn

round and meet the plane or not, according as the direction of projection

makes an angle with the perpendicular to the plane greater or less than

a certain angle a, which depends only on the distance from the plane.

When the circle is projected from contact, the values of a for densities of

the circle 0, 1, 10 are about 41░ 22'; 51░ 14' ; 70░ 15' respectively. If in

(ci) the circles are equal, and one is projected directly from contact with

+ +the other, the limiting velocity is (^tt"^ p --1)- (p 1)"^' times the

initial velocity. If it were projected in any way it will move as if attracted

on the whole by the fixed circle, the path will have its concavity turned

towards it, and will have two asymptotes, whose distances from the

+ +centre of the fixed circle are (p F^^y (p 1)"- times the apsidal dis-

tance, where Po is a certain number depending only on this distance. If,

= --for example, they touch when nearest Pq ^ tt- 1. If, on the contrary,

both are free to move (as in e), and they are projected so that the whole

'momentum' of the system is zero, they move as if they repel one

another, and the jDatli of one relatively to the other has its convexity

towards that other. If they are equal and touch one another at their

nearest distance, the distance of the asymptote of the path of one from

Q + -- +the centre of the other is
tt- p ly (p l)"-x sum of radii.

If there is cyclic motion between the circles it is possible to have them

moving steadily forward through the fluid, always keeping at the same

distance, provided the circles are equal. The discussion^ of this motion

shows that when the radii and distance of the centres are given there are

two possible relations between the velocity of translation and the relative

motion, one in which they are in the same direction between the circles

and the other in the opposite. If 2 a be the angle between the two

internal tangents to the circles, then when a is not nearly ^ tt, the two

ratios of the velocity due to cyclic motion alone, at the point half-way

between the cylinders, to the velocity of translation is very approximately

Stokes. In his paper ' On the critical values of the sums of periodic

of a circle of angle 2 a in the two forms of an infinite series and of a
definite integral, and expresses in the same two forms the moment of

inertia of the equivalent solid. The square of the radius of gyration is

and circular functions. The semicircle is the simplest,^ next comes the

quadrant of a circle, and a sector of 60░, the two last given by Greenhill,^

who has investigated the case of the sector very fully. In this paper

the case when the angle is any sub-multiple of two right angles is also
considered. The expressions obtained are naturally rather complicated,

but they are finite and in terms of circular and logarithmic functions.

For the two particular cases of the semicircle and quadrant he shows

that the ratios of the squares of the radii of gyration of the equivalent

--solid, and the solidified fluid, are IG/tt^ 1, and (16 log 2)1^^--^,

respectively. He again takes up the question in a later paper'' (1880),

and obtains a finite expression for the functions when the angle of the

sector is commensurable with two right angles. The square of the ratio

of the radius of gyration of the equivalent solid to the radius of the

circle is in this case

    When sources and sinks exist inside a sector the motion may easily be

determined by means of what is already known for the space between
two lines. The position of rest of a vortex inside a sector has been de-

termined by Lewis.^ It lies on the line bisecting the angle at a distance

being x/^i. The general motion both for vortices outside and inside a

without straight boundaries, is given by Greenhill ^ with figures illustrating

the paths for two, four, and six vortices respectively.

the limiting case of an ellipsoid when one axis becomes indefinitely large.
Green may be regarded as the first worker in this field (1833) ; but the
first to consider definitely the ellipse was Stokes (1843) in his before-
mentioned paper 'On some cases of fluid motion'; but in this he only con-

sidered the motion approximately, in the space outside an ellipse of small
eccentricity, for translation and rotation. He*' has also shown that con-

focal conies are possible forms for stream lines, though the motion is only

irrotational in the case of the rectangular hyperbola. In 1873 Beltrami^

gave the velocity potential for the motion of an elliptic cylinder as a case

of the ellipsoid, whilst Ferrers ^ determined the stream function two years
later (1875) for motions of translation and rotation. In the latter year
also Lamb-' published the expressions for ^j and \p in the forms which

are now generally used, and given in KirchhofF's ' Vorlesungen ' and

Lamb's ' Theory of Motion.' In this paper will be found diagrams of
the lines of flow. The path and motion of an ellipse moving in an infinite

fluid have been worked out by Greenhill, '" who has given figures illustrating
the motion for the three cases when it is projected, so as to make (1)
oscillations, (2) whole revolutions, and (3) when it is projected in the

direction of the major axis with infinitely small angular displacement.

from the solations for the circle obtained by Greenhill.
     The images inside an ellipse due to either a source, or a doublet

outside it, have been determined by the writer.' In general it may be

taken to consist of a line distribution of sources and doublets along the
straight line joining the foci, and of an isolated image or not, according

to the position of the original soni'co. When this lies beyond a certain

confocal ellipse, determined by the size of the bounding ellipse, there is
no isolated image, -whereas, if it lies within, there is an isolated imago
lying on the confocal hyperbola through the 'object.'

     Where the ellipse degenerates into the line joining the foci the

isolated image is always absent, and there is only a distribution of
doublets along the line. The densities at a point are given throughout
in terms of the position of the point and of the object soui'ce or doublet

these expressions for certain particular positions of the source become
very simple. Thus, in the case of a line AB, and a doublet at P,, on

P on the line is proportional to

     The motion of a mass of fluid in the form of an elliptic cylinder
rotating about its axis under the attraction of its own mass has been
touched upon by Dirichlet and Riemann in their investigations on the
similar problem for the ellipsoid referred to below. More particularly,

Lipschitz 2 gives equations for the motion of such an ellipse, both for
vibrations of form and rotation, and shows that they are purely periodic
between definite limits. Kirchhoff '^ has given a simple case, where the

--boundary rotates without change of form a case which is embraced in a

more general solution of the same problem given by Greenhill.^ The
latter considers the motion to be generated by supposing the fluid to
rotate within a rigid boundary as a solid body with angular velocity w, and

an additional angular velocity w' to be impressed on the boundary. He
finds that we may suppose the boundary removed, provided the relation

between these quantities and the axes is given by

general too complicated. The mathematical interest attaches itself to
solutions for the case of given boundaries or given conditions, and

reduces itself often to a suitable transfoi'mation by conjugate functions,

whereby the given boundary maybe transformed to one consisting of lines

or circles, the solution of which is known. This has been applied in
some of the preceding examples. Of direct solutions other than those

already mentioned two require notice here. One by Ferrers,' who has

determined the (]i and -^ functions for the spaces (1) inside an ellipse and
between the two branches of a confocal hyperbola, and (2) between an
ellipse and one branch of a confocal hyperbola, when the boundary
rotates; also for two confocal parabolas, the limiting case of (2). The

  --Non-plane Two-dimensional Motion. The hydrodynamical interest of

plane two-dimensional motion consists in its physical application to the

motion of cylinders in an infinite fluid, or of cylinders of finite length in
the space between two planes perpendicular to and touching the ends of

the cylinder. When the space considered is not plane, the motion may

be represented physically by the steady motion of electricity, the surface
being supposed a conductor. The surface of a s^iherc is one which has
received some attention. The case of the motion for a source and sink
at opposite extremities of a diameter was discussed by Robertson Smith ^

in his paper referred to above. Beltrami* has given the general
solution of the equation of continuity for the surface of a sphere which is

analogous to that for plane space in terms of polar co-ordinates. He

shows that, d and (p being the co-latitude and longitude of a point, the

general solution for the potential is in the form

+ B +(a log tang
j (af -f &) 4- 2 i Antan^^ 2  B,,cot" jcos(?i^ 4- a).
                                          ^

This he applies to the case of the motion of a spherical cap on the sphere,

and finds that, a being the spherical radius of the cap and (6q . ^tt) the

co-ordinates of the instantaneous centre of rotation, the potential is pro-

portional to sin fio(sin ^aycot ^0 cos <j>, the centre of the cap being at the
=pole. The lines of flow are given by cot ^9 sin (j) const., and of flow
-- + =relative to the cap by (cos a cos 0) cot ^0 sin f cot 0^ cos
                                                                    const.

These are the intersections with the sphere of hyperbolic cylinders

whose asymptotic planes are, one parallel to the boundary of the cap (a

small circle of the sphere), and the other to the great circle of the sphere

which gives the instantaneous direction of motion of the centre of the

cap. He also discusses the time a particle takes to describe its path, and

particular forms of the paths. The f and \p functions for sources and
sinks on a sphere, or certain portions of spheres, bounded by circles, have

been investigated by Hill,' who arrives at the necessary expressions by
transforming the variables so as to make the equation of continuity of

the same form as in plane motion, and taking similar functions of those

variables. Amongst many interesting results may be mentioned those

for equal source and sink. Hero the stream lines ai'e the small circles
through the source and sink (intersections of sphere with planes through
the chord joining the points), and the potential lines are the system of
small circles orthogonal to the foregoing (the intersections with planes
passing through the line of intersection of the tangents to the sphere
at the source and sink). Allen '^ has made a valuable remark, that the
transformation which Hill has used is geometrically equivalent to trans-
forming the equipotential and stream lines for any motion on a plane by
a stereographical projection into a corresponding motion on the sphere.
This might be regarded as making the theory for the spherical surface as
complete as for the plane, were it not that the projections do not always
correspond in simplicity to the original curves. For instance, he shows
that confocal conies project into quartic curves, and that confocal sphero-
conics are the projections of quartic curves. The case of motion on
the surface of a cylinder is also touched upon, as it has also been by

Boltzmann.^

  --Planes. The image of a source in presence of an infinite plane has

long been known, and is obvious. Stokes was, I believe, the first to
employ it. The velocity-potential for a source between two parallel

--planes which is the sum of the same functions for the infinite train of
--images has been given by myself,* whilst Greenhill ^ has solved the

corresponding problem for the case of a rectangular box. When the

origin is at one corner and a single source at the point Xi-y^.z^ the poten-

tial is

case of a liquid, and he showed that the effect of an incompressible fluid
is to increase the inertia of the sphere by one-half the mass of the fluid
displaced by the sphere. His investigation was published in 1832, and,
the year after, Green read a paper on the same subject before the Royal
Society of Edinburgh, in which he considered the ball of the pendulum to
be ellipsoidal. His investigation was carried out without a knowledge of
Poisson's work, but he gives the same result as to the effect of the sur-
rounding fluid. In 1835 Plana и also took up the subject in a long paper
of 166 pages, in which he attempted to take account of the friction, and

of small differences from the spherical form of the pendulum. He con-

sidered the friction on the spherical surface to be proportional to the
relative motion of the fluid over the surface, and that this relative motion
was the same as if there were no friction. For frictionless fluid his
results agree with Poisson's, as do Stokes^ deduced in 1843 as a special

case of a more general one.
     In 1852 the same problem was solved by Dirichlet ' independently.

He found, in addition, the equation to the stream lines. The chief im-

portance of this paper lies in the impulse it gave in Germany to the study

of hydrodynamics, forming as it does the first of a series of important
papers by himself, Clebsch, Riemann, Helmholtz, and Kirchhoff . Clebsch *
(1856) also gives the stream lines as a particular case of those for the
ellipsoid, and discusses with more detail the motion of a spherical ball-

pendulum. Amongst new results may be mentioned the equations to the

paths of particles, the co-ordinates being expressed very elegantly in

terms of elliptic functions of one arbitrary parameter. The motion of a
sphere in fluid when its centre of gravity is eccentric is the subject of a

paper by G. J. Michaelis.^

     It is well known how Thomson discovered that the electrification

induced on a sphere by a quantity of electricity at a point outside it,

produces the same effect on an external point as another portion of elec-

tricity at the optical image of the first, and how from this he developed

his theory of electric images. This theory suggested to Stokes to search

for an analogous theorem in fluid motion, and he found ^ that a doublet

(n) outside a sphere, with its axis directed to the centre of the sphere,

--has an image also at the inverse point, whose magnitude is fia^jr^,

\7here a is the radius of the sphere and r the distance of the external
doublet from the centre. The importance of this lies in the fact that the
motion of a sphere produces the same motion in the fluid as a doublet at
its centre, and thus it gives the means of solving the case of two spheres
moving along the line joining their centres. The general case, of which
the preceding is a particular instance, for the image of a source of fluid

    It is curious how, even down to the present moment, Dirichlet is regarded on
the Continent as the first investigator in this region, and how the work of Green and

outside a sphere has been given by myself ' (1879), and may be thus

stated. If a source, of strength ;h, is placed at a distance r, from the

centre of a sphere of radius a, the 'image' consists of (1) a source at

the optical image of m, and of magnitude majr ; and (2) a constant
line-sink extending from this isolated image to the centre, and of line-

density, mja. The image of a doublet (/u) with its axis in any direction

is then easily deduced by making a source and sink approach indefinitely

near to one another. When the axis points towards the centre, it is

clear that the line-distribution disappears, and we get the result found by

Stokes ; when the axis is perpendicular to the line joining it to the

^centre, the image consists of an isolated doublet /xa^'/r^ at the inverse

point, and a line doublet thence to the centre, whose line-density at a

--distance p is fipjar. It is curious ^ that if there is a source at a point
P and a constant line-sink betAveen P and Q, where Q is a point on the

line from P to the centre, then, provided the whole amount of the line-

sink is equal to the amount of the source, the * image ' of this arrange-

--ment is an arrangement of the same form viz., a source at P' the inverse

of P, and a constant line-sink between P' and Q', the inverse of Q, the

whole amount of the line-sink being equal to that of the source at P'.

This is of importance in the treatment of the motion of two sjDheres,

when one at least changes its volume.

The image of another kind of singular point, that of the element of a

vortex filament, has been determined by Lewis. ^ In this case the image

of a small element of a vortex line is the optical image of the element,

and their strengths are iuvei'sely proportional to the square roots of their

distances from the centre. Hence, any complete vortex filament has a

complete image, provided it lies on a concentric sphere. By means of

this theorem Lewis has investigated the motion of a circular vortex fila-

ment inside a sphere when it moves symmetrically with respect to a

Whendiameter.  it occupies a position of rest, its radius (r) is given by
_ _ --(0,2
}-2^ jQg f3j^j.3^Q,2  r'^yi^a^h^}      4a^ ; where a is the radius of the

sphere, and b is the radius of the sphere whose volume is equal to that of

the filament.

The motion standing next in simplicity is that of the initial motion of

the fluid contained between two concentric spheres when the inner begins

to move. This forms one of the examples considered by Stokes * in his

paper ' On some cases of fluid motion' (1843). He first finds the velocity

potential for any motion of the bounding surfaces, and shows that if the

inner sphere performs a small oscillation within the outer as a fixed boun-

dary, the motion is the same as if the inertia be supposed increased by a

+ --mass equal to ^(P 1a^)l{h^ a^) times the mass of the fluid displaced,

where a, h denote the radii of the inner and outer spheres respectively.

He then passes on to the case where a sphere moves in fluid bounded by

an infinite plane. This is important as the first application in hydrody-
namics of the principle of successive ' reflection ' of motion. Taking first

the motion of the sphere perpendicular to the plane, he finds the normal

motion at points of the plane due to the motion of the sphere on the

supposition that the plane docs not exist, and then adds the motion
obtained by impressing on every point of the plane velocities equal and
opposite to those at the same point produced by the motion of the sphere,
and again, takes account of the ' reflected ' motion of this from the surface
of the sphere. If the fourth powers of the ratio of the radius to the
distance from the plane be neglected he found that the mass of the

+equivalent solid is i(l Sa^/Sh^) times the mass of fluid displaced. When

the sphere moves parallel to the plane, the problem is treated by supposing
the plane removed, and an equal sphere to move as the optical image of
the first. Here under the same circumstances the mass of the equivalent

+solid is -5(1 oa^ jlGP) times the mass of the fluid displaced. In both

cases h denotes the distance of the centre from the plane. His discovery
of the image of a doublet whose axis goes through the centre of the sphere
enabled him to solve further problems ' which, however, he did not
publish at the time. One of them is printed in the first volume of his
collected works and is referred to below. The fact that a sphere projected

from the bounding plane moves as if accelerated, whilst if it is projected
parallel to the plane it moves as if attracted to it, was deduced from

general reasoning in Thomson andTait's ' Natural Philosophy,' published

in 1866.

     The whole question of the general motion of two or more spheres has
been considered very fully by Bjerknes in a series of papers dating from
18G8 onwards. In his first paper ' he treats of the movement of two
spheres moving in their line of centres, and shows how a series for the

velocity-potential may be obtained. He investigates more particularly

the case when their distances are so great that inverse powers of the
distance greater than the seventh may be neglected, and shows that the

uniform motion of one sphere, along the line of centres produces an

apparent repulsive force towards the centre of the other : also the general

movement of several spheres whose distances from each are so large com-
pared with their radii, that inverse powers of this ratio greater than the
fourtb can be neglected. Under these circumstances the action between

any two spheres is independent of the presence of the others. Forces occur
depending on the acceleration and the kinetic energy of the spheres, that due
to acceleration varying inversely as the third power of the distance, whilst

that due to the square of the velocity depends on the inverse fourth power.
     In 1871 Guthrie 3 published a curious theorem, due to Thomson,

Thomson found that if two spheres are in fluid and oscillating along the

than that of the fluid it is repelled or attracted according as the ratio of
its radius to the distance between the centres is less or greater than

+1 _4/||(l 2p)}. In the same year also, Bjerknes^ extended his

former investigations by taking into consideration changes of volume.
The velocity-potential is obtained in an infinite series in which the terms
are multiple integrals, which are integrable when the spheres move along
the line of centres. This was followed by a series of papers ^ in 1875 and
]876, in which the consequences of the motion were developed more fully.
If inverse powers of the distance above the fourth be neglected, the vibra-
tions of one sphere produce only oscillations of the other, if that other
does not also vibrate. Simultaneous vibrations of the same period produce
mean forces of the second, third, and fourth powers of the inverse dis-
tance ; thus, two spheres with concordant pulsations attract proportionally
to the inverse square of the distance, and repel according to the same law,

if they are in opposite phases. If a, b be the radii of the spheres then the

1^ j(force on (h) due to pulsations of (a) is  a~h '-^\ the density of

the fluid being unity. Two oscillating spheres behave in the opposite man-

ner to two magnetic poles. These actions have suggested to Herr Bjerknes
analogies with electricity and magnetism, which he has illustrated by a
series of beautiful and striking experiments.^ It must be remembered,

however, that the actions are the opposite of those of electricity and

-- --magnetism for instance, like oscillations attract nor is it easy to see

how the rotatory effects of magnetism can be illustrated in this manner.

In his ' Vorlesnngen iiber mathematische Physik' (1876), Kirchhoff

has given a short treatment of the question of two moving spheres, and

this has been carried somewliat further by Lamb in his treatise on the

motion of fluids. The present writer' has also applied the theory of

images, referred to above, to the solution of the same problems, and has

attempted^ to sketch out an explanation of gravitation on Thomson's

vortex-atom theory of matter. When two spheres intersect at an angle

which is a submultiple of two right angles, the number of successive

images is finite, and the velocity-potential has a finite form. Stokes,^ in

the reprint of his papers, has worked out in detail the case when two

spheres cut at right angles. 1Б r,d; r', 6' и r,, 8^, be the polar co-ordinates

of any point referred to the centres of the spheres, and the middle point

--The Ellipsoid. The solution of the problem of the most general motion

of an ellipsoid in fluid is due to the successive labours of Green (1833),

Clebsch (1856), and Bjerknes (1873). To the first we owe the velocity-

potential for a motion of translation, to the second that for a motion of

rotation and the stream-lines both for translation and rotation, whilst

the third has given us the solution when the axes of the ellipsoid change

in any manner with the time.

Green's^ paper was read in 1833. In this he finds the velocity

potential for translation only, and the effective momentum of the fluid.

In finding the effective momentum Green neglected the term in the ex-

pression for the pressure at a point which depends on the square of the

velocity, and he supposed, therefore, that his result was only true for

small vibrations. It was not till ten years later, when Stokes proved that

this term produces no effect on the i-esultant pressure on a single body in

an infinite fluid, that it could be seen that Green's value of this momentum

was rigorously true. His solution for the sphere has already been men-

tioned                                he also gave the analogous expressions for the spheroids.  In 1835
                                   ;

Plana, in his before-mentioned paper, showed how to determine the velocity,

potential for a surface of revolution only slightly differing from a sphere

and moving parallel to its axis. Nothing more seems to have been done

for twenty- three years, until Clebsch's^ investigations were published in

1856, although the paper seems to have been finished in 1854. The first

part deals with the general theory of fluid motion, and has already been

referred to in the portion of this report presented to the Association last

year. Here we confine ourselves to his results bearing directly on the

ellipsoid. Clebsch was unacquainted with Green's work, and rediscovered
his values of the velocity-potential for a motion of translation. In addition
to the potentials for translation and rotation he gives the equations of the
lines of flow for translation, in terms of eUipsoidal co-ordinates, in the

=form log y  fV(^)<^^> ^liere X.fi.v are the ellipsoidal co-ordinates of a

point (xAj.z), with a similar expression for log z, which is so related to

the former that yz may be expressed in terms of an elliptic integral of the
second kind. The case of rotation is a more complicated one, and was

only completed in a note^ to this paper. Here the co-ordinates fi.i' are

expressed as integrals of functions of X, and thus the solution is reduced

to a question of quadratures. All these simplify very much when tho

ellipsoids are spheroids. Another period of nearly twenty years followed,

until Bjerknes ^ completed the general solution by investigating the poten-
tials when the boundary itself changes its form, yet so as to remain ellip-

soidal. He considers the generalised problem of motion in space of ?*

dimensions, and extends the former results to this case. The second paper

is divided into two parts, the first devoted to the motion in the infinite
fluid outside the ellipsoid, the second to that inside. His results are

given below, for space of three dimensions.

     As the results are important, and extremely interesting, I have thought

it would be well to give a short notice of the results of the three foregoing

writers, expressed in a consistent notation.

    The effective mass and the effective moment of inertia have been given

by Green and Clebsch respectively in not very comjDlicated forms, but it
does not seem worth while to reproduce them here. The function il also
serves to determine the stream-lines for a spheroid moving parallel to its
axis. They are given by Kirchhoff in his ' Vorlesungen ' in the form

 -- =< C +|-p > const, (p.a;) being the cylindrical co-ordinates of any

point, and the other equation being given by any plane through the axis.

    When the space in question is that inside an ellipsoid, the functions

become extremely simple. For translation the velocity is, of course, a

linear function of the rectangular co-ordinates, whilst for rotation about

I have not been able to discover who first determined the potential

for the internal motion when the boundary rotates. It was given by

Bjerknes,' Beltrami,^ and Clerk Maxwell,^ all in 1873, but I believe tho

results must have been known before. Maxwell set it in a fellowship

examination at Trinity College, Cambridge, with a rider, that after a
certain number of revolutions, all the liquid particles would occupy the
same positions relatively to the boundary.

Several other writers have discussed the motion of the ellipsoid, but

their work has either been based on that of Green or Clebsch, or their

Aresults have been developed anew.  short notice, in order of the several

papers, will therefore suffice here. Ferrers и (1875) deduces the velocity-

potential for translation and rotation, and finds the vis viva of the fluid
motion by showing that the velocity-potential for a point just outside the

surface, bears a constant ratio to that just inside. This is a valuable re-
mark, and shortens the calculation very much, for since the normal motion
is the same in both cases, it follows that the energy of the motion outside

has the same ratio to that within. It is seen at once how this enables

us to deduce immediately the energy for translation. Sharpe^ (1876)

uses the methods of Green developed in his memoir on the determination

of the attractions of elHpsoids of variable densities, to obtain the velocity-

potentials for translation and rotation, but he does not refer to Green's
memoir on the same subject. In 1879 GreenhilP discussed the motion of
an ellipsoid in general, and in particular of a spheroid. Amongst the

results obtained may be mentioned the condition that a prolate spheroid
projected through a fluid may keep its point in front. He found that it

must have an angular velocity about the axis

where Cn, C33 are the effective masses along and perpendicular to the axis,
and Cgg, c^^ the effective momenta of inertia about the axis, and a line
perpendicular to it.^ In this same paper he has determined the initial
motion of an ellipsoidal solid within a confocal ellipsoidal shell, when the
shell has any motion of translation or rotation impressed on it, also the
small oscillations of such a body about the jjosition of confocality. In
the same year also Craig-* published a paper dealing with the same
questions with reference to a single ellipsoid, and containing transforma-

tions to the notation of elliptic functions.

    By making one of the axes of an ellipsoid indefinitely small we arrive

at a solution of the equation of continuity with conditions over a jDlano
elliptic disc, but which does not satisfy the hydrodynamic conditions that

the pressure must be everywhere finite. The solution of the discon-
tinuous motion which ensues when a disc is moved perpendicular to itself

through a perfect fluid has yet to be found.
     Another motion in connection with surfaces of the second degree is

that where the stream-lines are the lines of curvature on a family of one

--kind of confocal quadrics or are the intersections of two families and

orthogonal to the third. By supposing the hyperboloid of one sheet to
degrade into the space outside the focal ellipse we get the solution of the

equation of continuity for fluid flowing through an elliptic hole in a

plane.

   --Fluid ElUpsoid and Sphere under their oion Attractions. The problem

of the ellipsoidal forms of equilibrium of a rotating fluid, under the attrac-

tion of its own particles, is naturally the next object for consideration.

Since Maclaurin's discovery of the spheroidal form of equilibrium, and
Laplace's discussion of it, little seems to have been done until Jacobi
announced to the French Academy, in 1834, that particular ellipsoids,
with three unequal axes, could also be forms of equilibrium for fluid rota-
ting about the least axis. The fact being discovered, several proofs were
given by different writers, Liouville,"* Ivory, '^ Pontecoulant,^ and others.
The first to discuss the case with any fulness was C. O. Meyer,'' of

Koenigsberg, who set himself to do for Jacobi's case what Laplace had

done for Maclaurin's. If w be the angular velocity, and if the ratio of
w-/27r to the force between two unit volumes of the fluid at unit distance, be

denoted by V, then the combination of Meyer's investigation and Laplace's,

gives the following results. If an ellipsoid is to be a form of equi-
V V = V = Vlibrium, must lie between the values
                                          and  -2246. ... If

= Vlies between and Vq и18711 . . . then for a given value of there is

one ellipsoidal form with unequal axes, and two spheroidal forms, whilst
V =for Vq the former coalesces into that spheroidal form which has the
V Vless axis of rotation. When is between Vq and there can only be hvo
V = Vspheroidal forms, which for
                                  coalesce into one. The ultimate

Vspheroid to which the ellipsoid approximates when := Vq has the ratio
V =of its axes equal to и5827. . . . For
                                          the limit for the ellipsoid is the
--circular cylinder, whilst the spheroids are one a sphere and the other an

infinite disc. It is clear that the most natural datum to take is not the

angular velocity but the angular momentum, which remains constant,

however the fluid may change its form. This was a point of view adopted

by Laplace in treating of the spheroidal form, and Liouville ' took up

Meyer's problem in the same way in a paper read before the French Aca-

demy of Sciences in 184.3, in which he showed that the ellipsoidal form

with unequal axes is only possible provided the ratio of the angular mo-

mentum to the mass is greater than a certain limit, thus differing from

the spheroids, which are forms of equilibrium for any given angular mo-

mentum. What happens when the angular velocity of a spheroid is too

great for it to keep its form ? This could be answered generally from

the foregoing theories, viz., that tbe spheroid would become flatter, so

decreasing its angular velocity, and that it would vibrate about some

mean position ; but whether its external form would always be spheroidal,

or what the precise manner of the movement might be, could not be

decided. This question was answered, and the complete theory of the

motion of sjiheroids of fluid investigated, in a posthumous paper by

Dirichlet,2 edited and enlarged by Dedekind. The extremely beautiful,

and in its fundamental idea simple, theory of Dirichlet threw open to

mathematicians a new and rich field for further investigations, of

which they were not slow to avail themselves, so that now it may be said

that we know the general pi'operties of the motion of a mass of fluid

moving with a free ellipsoidal surface under its own attraction. Dirichlet's

first conception dates from the winter of 1850-1857, so his editor, Dedekind,

says ; but the author, wishing to extend them further, did not publish his
results in full, and they did not appear until 1859, after his death, when

Dedekind published them with some further results of his own. I will

first attempt to give a genei'al idea of his method, then refer to the chief

results of his investigation, and afterwards pass on to notice the work

done by other mathematicians, following on the lines laid down by him.

Considering that the Lagrangrian method of treating fluid motion is

better fitted than the Eulerian when the boundary surface changes with

the time, he asks the question. Is it possible to have the co-ordinates of a

particle at any time linear functions of its original co-ordinates, and if

BO, to what kind of motion does it refer ? It is clear at once that those

particles originally lying on an ellipsoid must always do so, though not

in general tlie same. The coefficients of the original co-ordinates will be
nine in number, and functions of the time alone. Substituting the
velocities and the attractive forces in the equations of motion, it is found
that the initial co-ordinates enter linearly, and hence, in order to have a
free surface, the pressure must be of the form

              ^A+P ,, _ _ ^' _ V>^

where the coefficient of a equated to zero gives the initial surface, and o-

is a function of the time alone. Equating to zero the coefficients of

^Oi 2/0. ^0 there result, with the equation of continuity, ten equations to

determine ff and the nine coefficients. This is the fundamental idea и

for the development I must refer the reader to the paper itself, contenting

myself here with giving some of the chief physical results of Dirichlet's

investigation. This was confined, so far as he worked it out in detail, to

surfaces of revolution. When there is no rotation, and the original form

is an oblate or prolate spheroid at rest, the form vibrates through the

sphere to a prolate or oblate spheroid respectively, and he finds equations

to determine the limits and the time of vibration. If in any position the

velocity of change of an axis surpasses a certain limit the form does not

vibrate, but the spheroid either lengthens infinitely or flattens infinitely,

but the presence of the slightest amount of rotation prevents the former

ultimate state, a result easily foreseen from the constancy of ano-ular

momentum. When rotation occurs three cases present themselves, dis-

tinguished by the relation of the angular velocity to the momentary form.

The first gives no change of form, and  leads  to  Maclaurin's  spheroid                                   in
                                                                                                        ;

the second the spheroid vibrates as well as rotates ; and in the third it

rotates and either flattens itself without limit, or, in the reverse direction

tends to an ultimate form not of infinite length. In the second case the

motion is only possible without a uniform external pressure over the

surface, provided the angular velocity at the moment of greatest

lengthening is less than a certain limit. The last section of this paper is

nearly all due to Dedekind. In the foregoing the same particles always

form the principal axes of the ellipsoid. Dedekind states here that there

are only two other cases in which this is the case, one in which an ellip-

soid vibrates without rotation, for which the co-ordinates are propor-

tionate to their initial values, and the other is Jacobi's ellipsoid. He

further states another possible motion where an ellipsoid satisfying

Jacobi's conditions retains its form stationary in space, with an internal

motion of the particles given by

This may be referred to as Dedekind's ellipsoid.

     The proof of these theorems Dedekind gave in an appendix ' to
Du-ichlet's paper republished in Borchardt's Journal, and in addition a
remarkable reciprocal law between two correlated motions with the same
boundary surface. It is thus stated by him. To every motion of a fluid

really wanted is the variation of the axes, their motion, and the motion of

the fluid relative to the ellipsoidal axes at any time. Riemann,^ taking

up the problem where left by Dirichlet and Dedekind, adopted as his

unknowns, a, the axes, their instantaneous rotations about themselves,

and the instantaneous rotations of a second set of axes, which give the

relative motion of the fluid, and which may be defined as follows. The

particles originally lying on the axes, at all future time lie on a set of

--conjugate axes of the momentary ellipsoid are, in fact, tho lines to which

the axes are deformed by a pure strain. If the momcntaiy ellipsoid be

changed by a pure strain to a sphere these become an orthogonal system,
and are the second system referred to.

Having formed the difierential equations, and the integrals equivalent

to constant impulsive couple, the equation of energy, and the surface

integral of vortex strength, Riemann devotes his attention to considering

the general question of persistence of form, where therefore the axes

are constant, and for which his form of the equations is very suitable.

He proves that if the form is to be persistent the axis of rotation of the

fluid must lie in a principal plane of the ellipsoid, and must be fixed rela-

tively to it. Calling a h c the axes in descending order of magnitude we
may state his results as follows. For the more general case where tho

axis of rotation lies in a principal plane there are three sub-cases (a)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

sary an external pressure in order to preserve the continuity of the fluid,

unless a, h, c are subject to another condition. In the more special case (^)
of motion about a principal axis, this axis must be either the least or the

mean. In fact calling c the axis of rotation and a the greatest axis, c

+ --must lie between h a and h a' where a, a' depend on the solution of

a transcendental equation. If a decreases towards coincidence with I,

=these limits for c become h and -303327 l, but if a 6 exactly (Mac-

laurin's spheroid) c can have any value between o and a. Jacobi's and

Dedekind's motions belong to this case, which also serves to connect con-

tinuously cases (a) and (y), whilst case (/3) remains isolated.

    Riemann gives the following way of representing the foregoing per-

     1 'Ein Beitrag zn den Untersiichungen liber die Bewegiing eines fiussigen

sistent motions. Suppose the particles to describe similar ellipses in

parallel planes perpendicular to a principal section of tlie ellipsoid in the

same way as if attracted to the centres of their paths. Then the actual
motion may be represented by supposing the whole system to have an

extra motion of uniform rotation about an axis in that principal plane.

In other words we may suppose the motion set up in the same way as

imagined by Greenhill, referred to below. In the latter part of his paper
he shows that when the axis of rotation is not a principal axis the motion

is unstable, that Jacobi's and Dedekind's ellipsoidal forms are stable, and

that in the other cases the motions are not stable if the two rotations

which represent the motion are in the same direction.

     In the same year as Riemann's researches appeared, Brioschi ' pub-
lished a paper in which he investigated equations for the moving axes
of the ellipsoid and the molecular rotations. Dedekind's reciprocal law
follows also easily from his forms of the differential equations. The in-
vestigations of Dirichlet and Riemann have been co-ordinated and pub-

lished in Italian by Padova^ with some extensions of his own, when the

ellipsoid changes its form periodically.

     In 1879 and 1880, in the ' Proceedings ' of the Cambridge Philosophical
Society, GreenhilP took up the same problem so far as it relates to
motions with persistent form, but from quite a different point of view
from that of Dirichlet. Instead of the Lagrangian equations he uses
the Eulerian referred to moving axes. The fluid is supposed enclosed in
a rigid envelope without mass, the whole system to have a rotation as a
rigid body communicated to it about one line through the centre, and

then a rotation of the shell alone about another. This is quite as general
as Dirichlet's, and has the advantage of expressing the motion in terms

of quantities whose dynamical meanings are evident. As the velocity-

potentials for the last rotations are known, the equations are obtained
with the greatest ease, and it only remains to find the condition that the

pressure of the fluid on the shell may be everywhere the same, in which
case the shell may be removed and the fluid mass will move as before.

In the first paper the case of rotation about the principal axis is alone
considered, and the relations between the axes and two rotations deduced.
This is case (3) of Riemann. In the second paper he takes up the
general question, and gives the condition for a free surface, but does not
discuss the equation giving the condition. The calculations can be even

here much simplified by considerations adduced at the end of the paper.

     On the same subject reference may be made to papers by Lipschitz^

 (1874) and Hagen^ (1879). The former uses Riemann's form of

 Dirichlet's expressions for the positions of the particles, finds the action,

and applies Hamilton's principle. The latter does not refer to any of the

are very small or very large. The motion of a sphere under its own

attraction vrhen slightly deformed, according to a spherical harmonic of

order n, is the subject of a paper by Thomson.' The time of oscillation

+ --is shown to be 2ir\/ {(2n l)a/2Ф(ii 1)</}, where g is the acceleration

at the surface produced by the gravitation. This is independent of the

size, and depends only on the density of the sphere. The forced oscilla-

tions of liquid spheres have been shortly treated by G. H. Darwin ^ in a

similar manner.

All the foregoing go upon the supposition that the density throughout

the mass is constant, but this is not the case with the planetary masses,

at least with the earth. This led Betti^ to take up the question of the

equilibrium of heterogeneous ellipsoids, the surfaces of equal density

being similar to the external surface. The investigation is not pressed to

fluids througli tubes and along canals. Stokes,' in Lis fii'sfc paper on vis-

cosity, worked out the case of watei' flowing down an inclined circular

cylinder under the action of gravity, as an example of the methods

developed in the paper. In a cylinder of radius a, inclined at an angle a,

-- + Uthe velocity at a distance r from the axis is h(a'^ r'-) U, being
=the velocity at the surface, and lc ^g sin a jfj. In 1860 Helmholtz

considered the analogous question where the motion is caused by a dif-

ference of pressure at the two ends, allowing also for a certain amount of

slipping at the surface of the tube. Here the velocity is given by
-- =A;(a* -1- 2Xa r^), where h
                                (diff. of pressures) /4/iZ, which gives a

+flow of ^Trkp(a'*' Xa^), agreeing well with experiments. The same

question has also been treated by Stefan, Boussinesq, Butcher, Graetz, and

Greenhill. Stefan ^ takes into consideration a motion of rotation of the

vessel as well. Boussinesq's * investigations are more general than the

others, and extend to tubes of non-circular sections. Considering the

-- + + =equation - -4r 4Z.- 0, which gives the velocity parallel to the axis,

he shows, from the principle of similitude, that in tubes of similar sections

the velocities at corresponding points are proportional to h and the areas

of sections, and that the flows in the same times are proportional to the

--fourth powers of the constant of similarity the forces acting being the

same. He then solves for the j^articular cases where the sections of the

--tubes are (1) elliptic, (2) rectangular, and (3), in a note at the end of

Athe paper, where the section is an equilateral triangle. If be the area

of the section, the flow for the elliptic tube is kAa-b"^ l(a^ + h'^) for the

=triangular (sides 2a) is IcLa^jh, whilst for the rectangular the expres-

sion is naturally more complicated. After noticing the case where in

a straight tube the section gradually changes, he passes on to consider

the motion where the axis of the tube is circular. This is interesting, as

a steady motion in circles is impossible if the boundary is at rest. Treat-

ing the velocities in any section of the tube as small compared with the

velocity across it, he solves the equation when the section is a rectangle

whose height is small compared with its breadth. The motion consists

of two circulations combined with a translatory motion along the tube of

greater magnitude. If the rectangular section be divided by a medial

line in the plane of the tube, the circulations may be represented by

supposing the particles of fluid near it to move outwards, increasing

their distance from it, and at last, on nearing the outer boundary, revers-

Aing their direction, and coming back nearer the longer sides.                                                                                          similar

lias publislied fartlier investigations on tlio same subject, but more from

the point of view of tlie liydraulic engineer.
     In 1876 Bntcher, in Lis paper before referred to,^ also touches on

the question of the motion in straiglit tubes, but without adducing new

results. Besides this he finds the general form for Stokes's stream func-
tion for a motion taking jjlace in planes through an axis. Graetz ^ has
worked out precisely the same questions as Boussinesq, to whose work

he does not refer. He has taken the trouble to calculate numerical

results for a tube with a square section, and has also followed out St.
Venant's idea by taking algebraical solutions of the equations, and finding
for what shaped tubes tbey are the solutions.

     Greenhill ^ has made a valuable remark by which the motion of a
viscous fluid in a straight tube of any section, without gliding at the
surface, may be deduced at once from the solution for the case of the
motion of a perfect fluid in a cylinder of the same section rotating about
its axis. This is seen at once when it is noticed that the difierential

equation for the velocity parallel to the axis in the first case has precisely
the same form as that for the stream function relative to the boundary,

rotating with an angular velocity 21c ; and that the bounding condition for

the two functions is the same, if in the first case the fluid is supposed to
stick fast to the boundary. In this way the velocities in tubes whose
sections are a circle, an ellipse, an equilateral triangle, two hyperbolas,

--a sector of a circle, and a rectangle, are written down at once.
     Cylinders. If two co-axial cylinders rotate with difiereut velocities,

wi, m, the velocity of the fluid between at a distance r from the common
axis, when steady, has been given by Stokes,'* with a single cylinder in
an infinite fluid as a particular case. When the motion takes place

--between two co-axial cylinders at rest being produced and kept up by
--pressures across two plane sections through the axis the expression for

the velocity is not algebraical as in the previous case. The solution for
this is due to Boussinesq, and is given in his paper in Liouville just

referred to. Rohrs ^ treats a similar question, taking account of non-

permanent motion. The determination of the motion of the fluid when a

cylinder oscillates in a direction perpendicular to its axis, forms one of
the chief problems considered by Stokes ^ in the second of his classical
papers on viscosity. The method employed is precisely similar to that

adopted for the corresponding problein for the sphere (noticed below)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

but, unfortunately, the solution of the differential equations occurring

cannot be represented in finite forms, as in that case. The functions
entei'ing are cyliudric harmonics, and this introduces a diSiculty in ap-

plying the condition of finite motion at an infinite distance, to determine

the arbitrary constants appearing in the solution, but that is surmounted.

The results are used to determine the effect of the wire by which it is

suspended on the time of oscillation of a ball-pendulum. If it be pro-

posed to determine the state of motion of the fluid due to a uniform

translation of the cylinder, it will be found that a steady motion of the

fluid will be impossible, but that as the time increases the quantity of

fluid carried forward with the cylinder continually increases. In fact, if

the differential equation for the stream function be integrated on the

supposition of steady motion, it will be found that, though the integral

takes a simple finite form, there are not arbitrary constants sufficient to

satisfy the conditions.

  --Plane and Disc. The determination of the motion of a disc in a viscous

fluid is important, as it forms a useful method to determine experimen-

tally the value of the coefficient of viscosity for different fluids. The

method was first employed by Coulomb, but first received mathematical

treatment by Stokes (1850), and afterwards (1861) by Meyer. Stokes *
begins by investigating the motion when an infinite plane oscillates in its

own plane, so that its displacement at any time is given by c sin nt. The

displacement at any point in the fluid at a distance x is then given by
-- -- Ac sin {nt .r\/(?i/2^4)} x exp x v/(ii./2^).
                                                      given phase is therefore

propagated with a velocity ^/2im. This for air, treated as incompres-

sible, andfor a time of vibration of one second, is about "2908 inch per

second. The solution for a disc oscillating in its own plane can then be

obtained by treating each element of it as a portion of the above plane, a

solution which is exact if the squares of the velocities are neglected, except

in so far as the action of the rim is concerned. In this way he finds the

change in the'time of vibration due to viscosity, and also the logarithmic

decrement of the arc of oscillation, with a correction to be applied,

because the observations are made soon after the disc is set in motion,

and before the motions, due to the starting in a fluid at rest, have dis-

appeared. The results obtained enable him to discuss the observations of

Coulomb.

     Without a knowledge of Stokes' work, O. E. Meyer ^ attacked the

same problem about ten years later. He supposes the angular velocity

of the fluid to depend only on the distance from the disc, and not on the

distance from the axis of rotation. This is equivalent to Stokes' appli-

cation of the motion for a plane to that for a disc. He also determines

the logarithmic decrement.

  --The Sphere. The analytical difficulties connected with this surface

may be considered to have been surmounted, chiefly through the work of

Stokes, Meyer, and Oberbeck. In his second paper on viscosity of

fluids Stokes ' attacks the problem of the motion by expressing the velo-

-- --cities in terms of the stream function first introduced by him ana

making the determination of this stream function the basis of the investi-

gation. The motion is supposed so small that squares and products of

the velocities may be neglected. In this case the stream function -^ must

from rest is worked out in detail. If the displacement of the centre of

    He then passes on to investigate the effect of a concentric spherical
boundary. When the effect of the boundaiy is small it is sufiicient to

treat it as absent, and then add small corrections to the results. If the
viscosity is small, or if the time of oscillation is small, this correction is
the same as if there were no viscosity.'

    We have seen (p. 27) that a steady motion of the fluid when a

cylinder moves uniformly through it is impossible. This is not so with

Vthe sphere. In this case Stokes shows, that, if be the velocity of the

= --sphere, ip :j aW(Srja ajr) sin ^6 (axes fixed in the sphere), and

that the force necessary to maintain the motion is G-rrf^iaV. This varies
only as the radius of the sphere, ' accordingly, fine powders remain
nearly suspended in a fluid of widely different specific gravity.' If a
sphere of density o- be descending through a fluid under gravity, the

--limiting velocity (if it is not very great) is 2g(t7 p)a^/9/u'; this for a

globule of water in air, of "001 inch diameter, is 1"593 inch per second,
whilst for one with a diameter of "0001 inch, it is less than one-sixteenth
of an inch per second.

     In a note at the end of this paper it is shown that if a sphere rotate
about a diameter the particles of the fluid move, when the motion is

=steady, in annuli, with velocities given hjv a'w sin 6 jr^, w being the

angular velocity of the sphere ; and that, in general, the motion is given

=by V v' sin d, where v' is a function of r alone. This steady motion in

annuli is only possible when the motion is slow ; if it is not so, then with

the annular motion is combined one in planes through the axis : ' In
fact it is easy to see that, from the excess of centrifugal force in the
neighbourhood of the equator of the revolving sphere, the particles in
that part will recede from the sphere and approach it again in the
neighbourhood of the poles, and this circulating motion will be com-

bined with a motion about the axis.' ' This may be compared with

Boussinesq's results for a circular tube of rectangular section, referred to
above.

     This investigation by Stokes is a most important one, forming as it
does the first application of mathematical reasoning with any success to
the problem of the motion of pendulums in non-perfect fluids. The second
part of the paper, forming about one-third of the whole, is devoted to the
discussion of the observations of Baily, Bessel, Coulomb, and Dubuat, and
the values of /u for water and air are deduced from their experiments. The
investigations with reference to cylinders and vibrating discs have been

already referred to.

     Stokes had considered the case when the fluid was originally at rest
without vortex motion in any part, and had, therefore, taken only those
particular solutions of the difierential equations which i/^i, \p2 satisfy, in
which d enters as the factor sin ^d. In 1870, O. B. Meyer ^ took up this
question and showed that the general solutions are expressed in the forms

   = =^b^ S(Aen + BZ,,)E,, exp (XH), .//^ 2(09^ + DZ,,)Sn exp (XH)

where 9, Z are functions of d alone, and R, S of r, both of flnite forms.

In fact, the 9, Z are proportional ^ to sin ddP /dd, where P is a zonal

spherical harmonic. The work is too complicated to be described with
any fulness here, but it is carried out with much skill, account being

taken of a concentric boundary. He proves, amongst other things, that

the motion due to the original state of the fluid decreases indefinitely with
the time, i.e., that the equation giving the values of X has all its roots

= =pure imaginaries except for the case ?i 1 or 9; sin^fl (Stokes' case),

in which it is complex, giving periodic vibrations with decreasing ampli-

tudes. In the particular case where the external boundary is infinitely

large, Meyer's results agree with those of Stokes for the time, but there

is a slight difference for the log decrement. When the surrounding fluid

is elastic the results must be modified ; this has also been considered by
Meyer '' who has determined the log decrement under these conditions,
and has shown that when the velocity of sound in the fluid is very great

the correction may be neglected without sensible error. Meyer refers to
a paper by 0. J. H. Lampe ^ on the same subject, but this I have not

seen.

     The investigations both of Stokes and Meyer are based on the stream
function, but this is only suitable when the motion takes place in planes

through an axis. When this is not so, recourse must be had to the

quaternion potential first introduced by Helmholtz ^ in his paper on
vortex motion. The investigation on these lines has been carried out by

     The above theory applied to a sphere moving uniformly gives values
for the velocities which agree with those of Stokes. Expressions are also
given for the vortex rotations, from which it can be easily proved that the
vortices of equal strength lie on concentric spheres, and that the strengths
are inversely as the squares of the radii of the spheres on which they lie.
The theory given by Craig is almost identically the same, as indeed any
theory, starting from the basis of Borchardt's theorem and the quaternion

potential, must be.
     The motion of fluid inside a sphere was first investigated by Helm-

holtz,-' allowance being made for a slipping of the fluid over the surface
of the boundary. The paper in which his investigation appeared was
a joint one, containing the mathematical theory by Helmholtz, and the
experimental by Piotrowski. The motion is considered so small that
squares of the velocities may be neglected, and in this case the motion is
such that it may be represented by supposing concentric shells of the
fluid to revolve as if rigid with an angular velocity depending on the
radius of the shell, the most general expression for which is a sum of

terms of the form

w,,= Ae"* < -^ cosli /3r  = ▒sinh (Sr > where /3  >/(o//i'),

and a is in general a complex. The motion can be represented as a series
of waves propagated to the centre with rapidly decreasing intensity, and
there reflected. If, for example, the boundary have a simple har-
monic motion of period -, the velocity of propagation of these waves
will be 2^ (^iTr/r), and is therefore dependent on the time of vibration.
Whilst the wave moves through a wave-length 2\/(/i7rr), the amplitude

--diminishes in the ratio 1 to exp.( 27r), or from 1 to 1/535. Helmholtz

works out the motion for the sphere as applicable to the data in
Piotrowski's experiments. These experiments contain the first attempt
to approximate to the value of the coefficient of gliding. The values
of this found for alcohol and ether are so small that they are probably

The same problem has been investigated by Liibeck ' (1873), starting

from Meyer's solution of the equation for the stream function, and by

     The oscillations of a viscous spheroid have been treated by G. H.

Darwin and Lamb. In the investigations of the former,'' which are devoted
more directly to researches on the past history of the earth, the motions

are treated as very slow, and the coefficient of viscosity as large, so that
the problems considered belong more to the domain of elastic solids than

to that of hydrodynamics. The latter ^ has considered the general solution
of the equations of motion when the velocities are so small that their

squares can be neglected. The first part of his paper is devoted to the

result agrees with that of Darwin's and the displacement subsides without
oscillation. For very small, the time of oscillation agrees with that for a
perfect fluid, found by Thomson,' whilst the 'modulus of decay,' i.e. the
time in which the amplitude decreases to 1/e of its original value, is

variation of resistance per degree was 0'0258 per cent. The same wire
was next placed in an iron tube which was filled up with sand and left

in the fire and cool slowly, as in the last-mentioned experiment. The
variation of resistance was now 0'095 per cent, per degree, and the wire

was as soft as pure silver and very fragile. After being heated to red-

ness and quenched in water, the corresponding variation of resistance of

the same wire was 0076 ; and when the wire had been drawn down

through two or three jewel-holes, it was 0'0732.

These results indicate a connection between the temperature-coefficient

of wires and their degree of hardness, and tend to reopen the question as

to the most trustworthy material for a permanent standard of resistance.

The Committee understand that Mr. Taylor will continue his experiments

with the co-operation of Dr. Muirhead.

     The Committee are pleased to be able to report that there is a pro-

spect that Lord Rayleigh may be able to organise, at the Cavendish

Laboratory, Cambridge, a system of testing resistance-coils and issuing

certificates of their correct value at a specified temperature.

    As stated in the Report presented last year, Dr. Muirhead has con-

sented, at the request of the Committee, to issue standards of capacity

upon his own responsibility.

The Committee regret that they are not able to report any progress

towards the construction of a standard of Electromotive Force.

     They are unwilling to conclude without expressing their deep sense of
the loss which not only they, but all friends of physical science, have
snffisred in the death of one of the most valued of their colleagues, Mr,

   in various Localities of Dry Land and under Water. Dragon
   up by Professor Everett (^Secretary).

 One portion of the duty assigned to the Committee is the investigation
 of the rate of increase of underground temperature downwards under

 luater. This part of their task has remained in abeyance until the past year,
 but through the good oflSces of Professors Lebour and Merivale observa-

tions have now been obtained from a colliery which runs to a considerable

 distance under the sea at Whitehaven, Cumberland.
      The observations were taken in holes bored upwards for the purpose

 to a distance of 4 feet in the roof of the ' Main Band,' at Croft Pit, under
 the direction of the manager, Mr. G. H. Liddell.

      The holes were well plugged with clay, and the thermometer (one of
 the Committee's slow-action instruments) was in each case left in the
 hole for 7 days. The distance beyond low-water mark was 430 yards in
 the case of two of the boreholes, and 1,340 yards in the case of the other
 two. The depths below ordnance datum were 1,140 feet for the two
 former, and 1,250 feet for the two latter. The depth of the sea in all
four cases is estimated at 12 fathoms. The temperature observed was
 exactly the same in all four holes, namely, 73░ F., and, in one instance,
this was verified by reinserting the thermometer with its bulb upwards
instead of downwards. These data give 1,195 feet as the mean depth
below ordnance datum, and 1,123 feet as the mean depth below the bottom
of the sea. Assuming 48░ as the mean temperature of the bottom of
the sea, we have, therefore, an increase of 25░ F. in 1,123 feet of ground,
which is at the rate of 1░ F. in 45 feet.

      Mr. E. Garside has furnished two more observations, one of them

--from the same neighbourhood as his previous observations the East

--Manchester coal-field and the other from South Stafibrdshire. They

were made with the slow-action thermometer, used in precisely the same
manner as before.

     The former observation was taken on May 4, 1882, in Denton Colliery,

Lancashire. The hole was drilled at 1,317 feet from the surface, nearly
vertically below the bed of the river Tame, which divides the estate of
Denton Colliery from that of Bredbury Colliery, and the temperature
observed was 66░ P. Assuming a surface temperature of 49░, this gives
an increase of 17░ in 1,317 feet, which is at the rate of 1░ in 77^ feet,
being nearly identical with that found at Bredbury Colliery.

     The other observation was made at Lye Cross Colliery, Dudley (north
of Wolverhampton). The thermometer was placed, as usual, ia a hole
about 4 feet deep, drilled for the purpose in ground newly opened, free
from cracks or other visible irregularities, and also free from any strong
air-current. It was at the depth of 700 feet from the surface, in the hard
        ON THE EATE OF INCREASE OF UNDERGROUND TEMPERATURE. 73

shales which are 8 feet in thickness, forming the floor of the ten yards
coal and roof of the Heythen coal, the total thickness of the seam worked
(with small parting) being about 52 feet. The temperature observed
was 57░-5 F. which, with an assumed surface temperature of 49░, gives
an increase of 8░-5 in 700 feet, being at the rate of 1░ F. in 82 feet.

     The colliery is situated on the summit of a hill 822 feet above sea-
level, so that the point at which the observation was taken was 122 feet
above sea-level. The convexity of the ground must be taken into account

as one element in endeavouring to account for the slowness of the ob-

served rate of increase. Of the 700 feet of superincumbent shales, about
470 consist of coal measures, 165 of clay marl, and 65 of basalt, connected
with dykes whose many branches traverse the coal at slopes varying from
vertical to horizontal. The basalt is found to contain, when newly cut
open, a remarkable quantity of salt water ; and the charred coal next to
the dyke is as porous as ordinary coal cinders for a distance of several inches

from the dyke.
     The Secretary has had a correspondence with Mr. Garside respecting

the quantity of water found in the East Manchester coal-field. This
quantity is very large, as appears from a list furnished by Mr. Garside of

the number of gallons pumped per minute from each of thirteen pits

during the sinking, the list being given on the authority of William

Seddon, Esq., mining engineer, who was contractor for the sinking of
them. The average is 360 gallons per minute for each pit, the highest

being Denton Colliery with 1,000 gallons, and the lowest Valley Pit,
Denton, with 120 gallons. Particulars are also given of the quantity

now pumped from some of the collieries, amounting in some cases to 800 or
900 gallons per minute. Some of the collieries have been repeatedly

flooded, and one is mentioned (Lord's Field Colliery) which was aban-
doned on account of water, though its owners were makers of hydraulic
machinery, and tried their utmost to keep the water down. Some of the

pits were formerly the sources of water-supply for towns in the district.
In Astley Deep Pit, Dukinfield, the shaft is ' tubbed ' with cast-iron rings

to keep the water back ; and most of the shafts in the district are made
as water-tight as possible. Mr. Garside refers to the ' Memoir of the

Geological Survey round Oldham,' as stating, on page 45, that five million

gallons a day are estimated as being raised from the New Red Sandstone.

     The question naturally arises whether this abundance of water does
not exert a powerful cdnvective action, and furnish the explanation of the
slow increase of temperature downwards, which has been observed not
only in the coal mines of this district but also in a still more marked

degree at the Liverpool waterworks at Bootle.
      Nine years having elapsed since the last observations were furnished

from the great well at La Chapelle in the north of Paris, which was then

in course of sinking, the Secretary has put himself in communication with
the contractors to learn what progress has been made, and has received a
letter dated July 8, 1882, giving a history of the undertaking during the

interval.

     The continual crumbling down of the sides rendered tubing necessary,
and a tube was accordingly constructed 677m. long, l-3m. in diameter,
and 2 centimetres thick. During the lowering of it, a portion 120m.
long broke ofi" and fell to the bottom, leaving another piece 100m. long

into four lengths by a new and special tool, and three of these were

raised                               but   the  fourth                                                                             was  so  broken  and  jammed that the extracting
                                  ;

tool could not remove it. Dynamite was tried, but its explosive violence

was so deadened by the superincumbent pressure, that it proved power-

less, and a special engine had to be constructed for crushing the broken

pieces. This task has now been successfully accomplished, and the work

is accordingly just as forward as it was before the tubing was com-

menced. The Municipal Council of Paris have now ordered the con-

tinuance of the operations, and the tubing will be recommenced. Owing

to the difficulties above described, the well is now no deeper than it was

when the last observations of temperature were taken in it nine years

ago.

Two slow-action thermometers have been sent to Mr. "W. Galloway

(Member of the Committee and Inspector of Mines, Cardilf), for obser-

vationa in mines.

One slow-acting and one Negretti maximum thermometer have been

sent to Mr. T. W. Rumble, Engineer of the Southwark and Vauxhall

Water Company, for observations in a deep well now sinking at Tooting.

   A slow-acting thermometer has also been supplied to Mr. Grifi&th,

Manager of a Colliery at Wrexham.

This, the iifteenth Report of the Committee, is accompanied by a

summary, which has been made by the Secretary, of the fourteen pre-

ceding Reports, together with as much as it was possible to include of

the present Report.

            ON THE RATE OF INCREASE OF UNDERGROUND TEMPERATURE. 75

 --of two kinds slow-action thermometers and maximum thermometers.

   The present pattern of slow-action thermometer consists of a thermometer
   having its biilb surrounded by stearine or tallow, the whole instrument
   being hermetically sealed within a glass jacket, and had its origin in a
   conference between the Secretaiy and Dr. Stapff in the St. Gothard
   tunnel (VIII., IX., XI.) Other slow-action methods described in the

 --reports are Angstrom's thermometer in bottle of water (I.), large spirit

   thermometer (I.), Symons' thermometer in a thick casing of felt (II.).

     --Our present patterns of maximum thermometer are two the Phillips,
 --and the Inverted Negretti both being hermetically sealed in strong glass

  jackets to prevent the bulbs from receiving pressure when lowered to a

   great depth in water.
        Both instruments are used in a vertical position, and it is necessary

   that they register truly in spite of jolts in hauling up. The Phillips pat-
   tern was used fii'st (I., II., III.), and there were continual complaints of
   the detached column shaking down, till it was pointed out by Professor
   Phillips himself, that the fault arose from the bore not being small enough.
   This defect was remedied (VI.), and the instilment has since worked
   perfectly, but it requires good light and sharp eyes to read it.

        The Inverted Negretti (IV.) was contrived by the Secretary with the
   view of overcoming the difficulty as to jolts, but the contrivance had been

  anticipated many years before by Messrs. Negretti & Zambra themselves.

   It is easily read and managed, but it has a theoretical defect in requiring
   a slight correction for the difference between the tem^Dcrature at the time

  of taking the reading and the maximum temperature recorded.
       References to some other kinds of maximum thermometer will be found

   in some of the reports, namely, to Walferdin's (IV.), Lubimofif's (IV.,
   v.), and Magnus' (IX.), all these being of the class of overflow ther-
   mometers.

        References to Becquerel's thermo-electric method of observing under-
   ground temperature were made in three of the reports (1., XI., XII.), and
   some laboratory experiments were subsequently carried out by the
   Secretary which led to the conclusion that the method could not he re-

  lied on to yield sufl&ciently accurate results. It may be mentioned that

   Becquerel's observations are only carried to the depth of 100 feet, whereas

  we require observations at the -depth of 1,000 or 2,000 feet.
        2. As regards subsidiary (that is non-thermo metric) apparatus, Mr.

   Symons' apparatus for lowering and raising thermometers to and from
   any required depth in a deep well (1,000 feet deep in this case), is de-
   scribed with an illustration in the second report.

         Plugs for preventing convection-currents in a bore or well are suggested
  in the first report, Herr Bunker's two forms of plug successfully employed

  by him at Sperenberg, are described in the ninth, and Professor Lebour's
  umbrella-like plug in the ninth, tenth, and twelfth. In its final form

   (XII.) it appears to be very convenient, as it requires only one wire. It
  remains collapsed so long as the wire is taut, but opens out and plugs the

  hole when ib becomes slack.
       B. Methods of Observation. These have chiefly been of two kinds.
        1. Observations in holes bored to the depth of a few feet in newly

  opened rock, either in the workings of a mine or a tunnel, or in a shaft
  during the sinking. The rock should not have been exposed for more

  than a week when the hole is bored, and a day may be allowed to elapse

  for the heat generated by boring to escape before the thermometer is

inserted. Very complete plugging is necessary to exclude the influence
of the external air. Ifc is desirable to use about two feet of plugging, of
which the outer part should be made airtight with plastic clay or greased
rag. After the lapse of a few days, the tliermometer is to be drawn out
by means of a string attached to the handle of its copper case, and the
reading taken. The slow-action thermometer above described is employed
for this purpose, and there is time to read it with suGBcient deliberation
before any appreciable change occurs in its indication. It is recommended
that the thermometer be then reinserted and plugged as before, and a
second reading taken after the lapse of a week. The majority of our
successful observations have been made by this method.

      2. Observations in deep bores of small diameter.

     The first report contained a successful application of this method to a
bore about 350 feet deep, near Glasgow, which gave very regular results in

a series of observations at every sixtieth foot of depth ; but in the majority
of instances in which it has since been applied, there have been marked
irregularities, due apparently to the influx of water from springs at

particular points. One of the most valuable of our results was obtained
by the application of the method to a bore 863 feet deep, executed at the
bottom of a coal mine 1,066 feet deep, giving a total depth of 1,929 feet.
The bore in this case was dry at the time of its execution, though full of
water at the time of the observation. It was in South Hetton Colliery,
Dui-ham, and the observer was Mr. J. B. Atkinson (V., VI.). The instru-

ment generally employed in the observations of this class was a maximum

thermometer of either the Phillips or the Inverted Negretti construction,

as described above.

     The larger the diameter of the bore the more uncertain does this
mode of observation become. The South Hetton bore had a diameter of

2h inches. The Kentish Town well, 1,000 feet deep, in which Mr. Symons'

observations were made, had a diameter of 8 inches (II., III., IV.), and
the well 660 metres deep at La Chapelle, in the north of Paris, had a
diameter of 4^ feet (V., VI., VII.). The temperatures in this last were
proved to be largely afiiected by convection, the water at the top being too

warm, and that at the bottom not warm enough. The observations of

Herr Dunker, in the bore at Sperenberg, near Berlin, with a depth of
3,390 feet and a diameter of 12 inches, proved a similar disturbance,

amounting at the top and especially at the bottom to several degrees. As
regards the bottom, the proof consisted in showing that when a ther-
mometer at the bottom was protected by a tight plug from the influence

of the water above, its indications were higher by 3░ R. (= 6|░ F.), than

when this precaution was not employed.
     3. Where a shaft contains only a few feet of water at the bottom, a

thermometer lowered to the bottom of this water may be assumed to give

pretty nearly the normal temperature of the soil at this depth, and a few
of our observations have been taken in this way. 'No observations of any
valne for our purpose can be made in the portion of a shaft or well occu-
pied by air, as the temperature of such air is largely influenced by that
of the air at the surface. This is clearly proved by Mr. Symons' observa-

tion in 200 feet of air at Kentish Town (II., III.).

      C. Questions affecting the Correctness of the Observations made
might theoretically include questions as to the correct working of the
instruments employed, and as to the personal reliability of observers ; but
the latter topic has not come into discussion, and the former has not arisen
ON TIIK EATE OF INCEEASE OF UNnERGEOUND TEMPERATDEE. 77

since our present patterns of instrument came into use. The questions
for discussion are thus confined to those which relate to possible diiferences
between the temperature of the point at which the thermometer was

placed and the normal temperature at the same depth in its vicinity.

1. The heat generated by the action of the boring tool will vitiate the

observation if snfScient time is not allowed for its escape.

   A very full discussion of this subject in connection witli the great

artesian well at La Chapelle will be found in reports V., VI., and VII.,
clearly establishing the fact that the temperature at the bottom both on
the third and the sixth day after the cessation of boring opei'ations, was
7j░ F. higher than after the lapse of four months, though the water had
been left to itself during this interval. Further evidence showing that

the temperature in the lower part of a bore full of water may thus be

raised several degrees, is furnished by the Snb-Wealden bore (VI. 255).

The heat generated by boring will increase with the hardness of the

rock, and Mr. Garside, in report XIV., testifies that he has found two

hours a sufiScient time to give the permanent temperature in holes 3^ feet

deep and 2 inches in diameter drilled in the sides of a deep mine in the

East Manchester coalfield.

    2. The generation of heat by local chemical action is well known to
be a powerful disturbing cause when pyrites is present. In the tentli

report, the observers in the mines of Schemnitz say, ' Pyrites and also

decaying timber were avoided, as being known to generate heat.' In the

uinth report, p. 210, the observations in the coal mines of Anzin show

a temperature of 70f░ F. in shaft IV. (a very dry one) at the depth of
21'2 metres, or less than 70 feet. This must be about 15░ F. above the

normal temperature. In shaft II. the observer mentions that there was at

a depth of 90 m. a seam of coal in which heat was generated by oxidation.

At Talargoch lead mine in Flintshire (XIII., XIV.), the discrepancies

between the temperatures at the six observing stations are suggestive of

local chemical action.

3. Convection of heat has proved a very troublesome disturbing cause.

As to convection of heat by air in a shaft or well not filled with water,

evidence will be found in the second report, both in the case of Mr.

Hunter's observations in the shafts of two salt mines at Carrickfei'gus,

having the depths of 570 and 770 feet respectively, and in the case of

Mr. Symons' observations at Kentish Town, where the first 210 feet of the

well are occupied with air. At the depth of 150 feet the temperature was

52'1 in January and 54'7 in July.

Convection of heat by water in old shafts whicli have heen allowed to

become flooded, is very manifest in some of the observations communicated

by Mr. Burns in the second and fourth reports. In Allendale shaft

(Northumberland), 300 feet deep, with about 150 feet of water, the

temperature was practically the same at all depths in the water, and this

was also the case in Breckon Hill shaft, where the observations extended

Afrom the depth of 42 feet to that of 350 feet.  similar state of things

was found in a shaft at Ashburton (Devon), by Mr. Amery (III. 7), who

observed at every fiftieth foot of depth down to 350 feet.

Convection by water in the great well at La Chapelle, 660 m. (2,165

feet) deep, and 1 35 m. (4 feet 5 inches) in diameter at the bottom,

appears probable from the following comparisons.

     Very concordant observations (communicated by M. Walferdin to

Compies Bendus for 1838) at three different wells in the Paris basin of
78 KEPOET-- 1882.

the respective depths of 263 m. 400 m. and 600 m., show, by comparison

with one another and with the constant temperature in the artificial

caves under the Paris Observatory, a rate of increase of 1░ F. in 56 or

57 feet (IV. 24, 25). These data would give at the depth of 100 m., or
328 feet, a temperature of 57░, and at the depth of 660m., or 2,165 feet,
a temperature of 90░ ; whereas the temperatures actually observed at those

depths in the well at La Chapelle in October 1873, when the water had

been undisturbed for a year and four months, were 59░'5 and 76░ (VI. 254)

It thus appears probable that the upper part of the well is warmed, and

the lower part cooled, by convection. Further light may be expected to

be thrown on this point when the well reaches the springs, and the water

Aspouts above the surface, as it does at the Puits de Grenelle.                         letter

received by the Secretary in July 1882 states that engineering difficulties

have prevented any deepening of "the well since the above observations,

but that arrangements for this purpose have now been made.

     More certain and pi'ecise information as to the effect of convection in
deep bores is furnished by the experiments of Herr Dunker at Speren-
berg (IX. 204-208). The principal bore at Sperenberg has a depth of

4,052 Rhenish, or 4,172 English feet, and is entirely in rock salt, with

the exception of the first 283 feet. Observations were first taken (with

a maximum thermometer on the overflow principle) at numerous depths,

from 100 feet to the bottom, and showed a fairly regular increase of tem-

perature downwards. The temperature at 700 feet was 16░"08 R., and at

3,390 feet 34░-l R. Plugs were then contrived which could be fixed

tight in the bore at any depth with the thermometer between them, or

could be fixed above the thermometer for observinfj at the bottom.

Convection was thus prevented, and a difference of one or two degrees

Reaumur was found in the temperatures at most of the depths ; at 700 feet

Wethe temperature was now 17░'06 R., and at 3,390 feet 36░-15.                          have

thus direct evidence that convection had made the temperature at

3,390  feet  2░-05  R.,  or  4░-6 F.  too  low                      and  this, as Herr  Dunker
                                                                 ;

remarks, is an under-estimate of the error, inasmuch as convection had

been exerting its equalising action for a long time, and its effect could

not be completely destroyed in the compai'atively short time that the

plugs were in position. Again, as regards the effect of convection on the

upper part of the bore, the temperature 11░'0 R. was observed at the
depth of 100 feet in the principal bore when no plugs were employed,

while a second bore only 100 feet deep in its immediate vicinity showed

a temperature 9░*0 R. at the bottom. This is direct evidence that the

water near the top of the great bore had been warmed 2░ R. or 4^░ F. by

convection.

Suggestions for observations in filled-up bores will be found in the

eleventh report, but they have not yet taken a practical shape.

D. Questions affecting deductions from Obseevations.

1. In many instances the observations of temperature have been con-

fined to considerable depths, and in order to deduce the mean rate of

increase from the surface downwards it has been necessary to assume the

mean temperature of the surface. To do this cori'ectly is all the more

difficult, because there seems to be a sensible difference between the mean,

temperature of the surface and that of the air a few feet above it.

In the third report some information on this point is given, based on

observations of thermometers 22 inches deep at some of the stations of

the Scottish Meteorological Society, and of thermometers 3 (French) feet
        ON THE BATE OF INCEEASE OF UNDERGROUND TEMPERATURE. 79

deep at Greenwich and at Edinburgh. These observations point to an

excess of surface temperature above air temperature, ranging from half a
degree to nearly two degrees, and having an average value of about one

degree.

     Dr. Schwartz, Professor of Physics in the Imperial School of Mines

at Schemnitz, in sending his observations made in the mines at that

place (X. 195), remarks on this point :
     ' Observations in various localities show that in sandy soils the excess

in question amounts, on the average, to about half a degree Centigrade.

In this locality the surface is a compact rock, which is highly heated by

the sun in summer, and is protected from radiation by a covering of
snow iu winter ; and the conformation of the hills in the neighbourhood
is such as to give protection against the prevailing winds. Hence the

excess is probably greater here than in most places, and may fairly be

assumed to be double the above average.'

    Some excellent observations of underground temperature at small
depths were made at the Botanic Gardens, Regent's Park, London, for

the six years 1871-76, along with observations of air temperature, and
have been reduced by Mr. Symons. They are at depths of 3, 6, 12, 24,
and 48 inches beneath a surface of grass, and their joint mean derived
from readings at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. for the six years is 49 '9, the mean for
the 48-inch thermometer being 60'05. The mean air temperature derived
in the same way from the readings of the dry-bulb thermometer is
49 '6. Hence it appears that the excess of soil above air is in this case

about 0░-4.

     Quetelet's observations for thi-ee years at Brussels (p. 48 of his

'Memoire') make the earth, at depths less than 1^ foot, colder than
the air, and at greater depths warmer than the air.

     Caldecott's observations for three years at Trevandrum, in India,

make the ground at the depth of three feet warmer than the air by 5░'7 F.

     Dr. Stapff, in his elaborate publications on the temperature of the

St. Gothard tunnel, arrives at the conclusion that the mean temperature

of the soil on the surface of the mountain above the tunnel is some degrees

higher than that of the air, the excess increasing with the height of the
surface and ranging from 2░ or 3░ C. near the ends of the tunnel to 5░ or
6'^ C. in the neighbourhood of the central ridge.

Connected with this is the question

     2. Whether the mean annual temperature of the soil increases down-

wards from the surface itself, or whether, as is sometimes asserted, the

--increase only begins where annual range ceases to be sensible say at a

depth of 50 or 60 feet.

     The general answer is obvious from the nature of conduction. Start-

ing with the fact that temperature increases downwards at depths where
the annual range is insensible, it follows that heat is travelling upwards,

because heat will always pass from a hotter to a colder stratum. This

heat must make its way to the surface and escape there. But it could
not make its way to the surface unless the mean temperature diminished

iu approaching the surface                                                                                                                          for if two superposed layers had the same
                                                                                                                                                 ;

mean temperature, just as much heat would pass from the upper to the

lower as from the lower to the upper, and there would not be that excess

of upward flow which is necessary to carry off the perennial supply from

below.

This reasoning is rigorously true if the conductivity at a given depth
3 feet
        ON THE RATE OF INCREASE OF UNDERGROUND TEAirERATURE. 81

bear oafc these predictions from theory. The discussion of the former

occurs in the fourth report, p. 15,

    As regards the St. Gothard tunnel, Dr. Stapff reports (XII. 41) :
    ' The mean rate of increase downwards in the whole length of the

tunnel is "02068 of a degree Centigrade per metre of depth, measured

from the surface directly over. This is 1░ F. for 88 feet. Where the

surface is a steep ridge the increase is less rapid than this average ; where
the surface is a valley or plain the increase is more rapid.'

     4. The question whether the rate of increase downwards is upon the

whole the same at all depths, was raised by Professor Mohr in his com-

ments upon the Sperenberg observations, and is discussed, so far as these
observations bear upon it, in the 9 th and 11th reports.

     Against the Sperenberg observations, which upon the whole show a

retardation of the rate of increase as we go deeper, may now be set the

Dukinfield observations begun by Sir William Fairbairn (III.), and con-

tinued by Mr. Garside (XIII. 3). Taking Mr. Garside's observations, and
assuming a surface temperature of 49░, the increase in the first 1,987^
feet is at the rate of 1░ in 79-5 feet; in tlae next 420 feet it is at the rate

of 1░ in 70 feet, and in the last 283^ feet it is at the rate of 1░ in 51^ feet.

    From a theoretical point of view, in places where there is no local

generation of heat by chemical action, the case stands thus :
     The flow of heat upwards must be the same at all depths, and this

flow is equal to the rate of increase downwards multiplied by the conduc-

tivity, using the word 'conductivity' (as above explained) in such a sense

as to include convection. The rate of increase downwards must, there-

fore, be the same at all depths at which this conductivity is the same.

     This reasoning applies to superposed strata at the same place, and
assumes them to be sufficiently regular in their arrangement to ensure that

the flow of heat shall be in parallel lines, not in converging or diverging

lines.

     5. If we have reason to believe that the flow of heat upwards is nearly
the same at all places, then the above reasoning can also be applied

--approximately to the comparison of one place with another that is to

say, the rates of increase downwards in two masses of rock at two difierent
places must be approximately in the inverse ratio of their conductivities.
In the cooling of a heated sphere of heterogeneous composition, the rates

of flow would at first be very unequal through different parts of the sur-

face, being most rapid through those portions of the substance which
conducted best ; but these portions would thus be more rapidly drained
of their heat than the other portions, and thus their rate of flow would
fall ofl" more rapidly than the rates of flow in the other portions. If the

only differences in the material were diff'erences of conductivity, we might

on this account expect the outflow to be after a long time nearly the

same at all parts of the surface. But when we come to consider

differences of ' thermal capacity per unit volume,' it is clear that with
equal values of ' diff'usivity ' that is of ' conductivity divided by thermal

capacity of unit volume ' in two places, say in two adjacent sectors of

the globe, there would be the same distribution of temperatures in both,
but not the same flow of heat, this latter being greatest in the sector in
which the capacity and conductivity were greatest.

    Where we find, as in Mr. Deacon's observations at Bootle, near
Liverpool, and to a less marked degree in the observations of Sir William

Fairbairn and Mr. Garside, near ]\Ianchester, an exceptionally slow rate

        1882.  G
--82 EEPOET 1882.

of increase, -without exceptionally good conductivity, it is open to us to
fall back on the explanation of exceptionally small thermal capacity per

unit volume in the underlying region of the earth, perhaps at depths of

from a few miles to a few hundred miles.

   A6. question which was brought into consideration by Professor Hull,

in connection with the great difference between the rate of increase at

Dukinfield and that at Rosebridge (III. 33), is the effect of the dip of the
strata upon the vertical conduction of heat. Laminated rocks conduct

heat much better along the planes of lamination than at right angles to

them. If ki denote the conductivity along, and k.2 the conductivity
normal to the planes of lamination, and if these planes are inclined at an
angle 6 to the horizon, the number of feet per degree of increase down-
wards corresponding to a given rate of outflow through the surface, will
be the same as if the flow were vertical with a vertical conductivity :

                                  +7i;, sin^        Jc^ cos^ 0,

     The following is the proof. Let the number of feet per degree of in-

crease in the vertical direction be n, so that - of a degree is the increase

                                                                     n
for a foot measured vertically. Then the increase for a foot measured in
the direction of dip is - sin 6, and the increase for a foot measured per-

n^endicular   to  the  laminae  is  -   cos   d.    The flow of heat in the direction

                                     n

of dip is, therefore, - Ici sin 6, and the flow perpendicular to the laminae

- Tc2 COS Q. Resolving each of these in the vertical direction, and adding,

e░et     the  vertical  flow -    (Jci  sin-        Icc, cos- 0), which must be equal to

tivity.

     Professor Herschel finds about I"3 as the ratio of the two principal
conductivities in Loch Rannoch flagstone, and 1'875 as the ratio in Fes-

tiniog slate.

     The dip of the strata at Dukinfield is stated by Mr. Garside to be 15░,

= =and we have sin^ 15░ '07, cos^ 15░ -93.
   =If we assume Ti^ 1"3 h.2, as in the case of flagstone, we find for the

+ =иeffective vertical conductivity 1;^ (-09 "93) 1-02 h.^, so that the number

of feet per degree would only be increased by 2 per cent.

   =If we assume ^i 1"875, as in the case of slate, we find

                        + =7^2 (13                  1-06 1-2,
                                              -93)

or the number of feet per degree would be 6 per cent, more than if the
strata were horizontal.

     It is not likely that the two conductivities in the strata at Dukinfield
are so unequal as even in the case of flagstone, so that 2 per cent, is a
high estimate of the effect of their dip on the vertical rate of increase so
far as pure conduction is concerned. The effect of dip in promoting the
jiercolation of water (III. 32) is a distinct consideration, but the workings

in the Dakinfield mines are so dry that this action does not seem to be

important.^

   WeE. now proceed to a comparison of results. The localities at

which definite results have been obtained may be thus classified :

     1, Metallic mines. 2. Coal mines. 3. Wells and wet borings.

4. Tunnels.

     1. The mines at Pkzibbam in Bohemia (VII. 15), with a depth of 1,900
feet, are in very quartzose rock, and give a very slow rate of increase,
viz. 1░-1 in 136 feet. As all the shafts are in lofty hills, an allowance of
-jLmay be made for convexity, leaving 1░ F. in 126 feet. Quartz is found
by Professor Herschel to have a conductivity of about '0086.

     The mines at Schemnitz in Hungary (X. 194), with a depth of 1,368
feet, give an average rate of 1░ F. in 74 feet, the rock being a green
hornblende-andesite (in German, G^-ihistein-Trachjt), which is a compact,
igneous, more or less vitreous rock. Professor Lebour estimates its
conductivity as being probably nearly the same as that of Calton Hill
trap-rock, which Professor Herschel found to be about и0029.

     The Talakgoch lead mine (Flintshire) (XIII., XIV.), with its veins
running across carboniferous limestone, has a depth of 1,041 feet, and gives
in various parts rates varying from 1░ in 47 feet to 1░ in 113 feet. The
average may be taken as 1░ in 80 feet.

     2. The results from coal mines are as follows, beginning with foreign

mines :

     The mines of the Societe Cocqueril at Seraing (Belgium) (VII. 17),
with a depth of 1,657 feet, give an average rate of 1░ F. in 60 feet. The
reck is coal shale. Professor Herschel found for shale the low conduc-

tivity of -0019.

     The mines of Anzin, in the north of France (IX. 210) with a depth of
658 feet, gave in the deepest shaft an increase of 1░ in 47 feet.

     EosEBRiDGE CoLLiERT, near Wigan (III.), with a depth of 2,445 feet,
gave a mean rate of 1░ in 64 feet.

     The four following are in the East Manchester coalfield :
     Astlet Pit, Dukinfield (III., XIII.), with a depth of 2,700 feet, gave

1░ in 72 ft.

     AsHTON Moss Colliery (XIV.), with a depth of 2,790 feet, gave 1░ in

77 feet.
     Bredburt Colliery (XIV.), with a depth of 1,020 feet, gave 1░ in 78-5

feet.

     Nook Pit (XIV.), with a depth of 1,050 feet, gave 1░ in 79 feet.
     Denton Colliery, Lancashire (XV.), with a depth of 1,317 feet, gave

an increase of 1░ in about 77 feet.
     South Hetton CotLiERY, Durham (V. 132, VI. 254), with a depth of

1,929 feet, including a borehole at bottom, gives very consistent observa-

tions at various depths, and an average rate of 1░ in 57'5 feet.
     Boldon Colliery, between Newcastle and Sunderland (X. 197), with a

depth of 1,514 feet, and excellent conditions of observation, gives an

average rate of 1░ in 49 feet.
     Whitehaven Colliery, Cumberland (XV.), in workings under the sea,

with a depth of 1 ,250 feet beneath sea-level, or about 1,178 feet beneath the
sea-bottom, gave an increase (from the sea-bottom) of about 1░ in 45 feet.

      KiNGSWooD Colliery, near Bristol (XII.), with a depth of 1,769 feet, and

и Though the workings are dry, there is a large quantity of water in the super-

incumbent strata. See Report XV.

remarkable consistency between observations at various points, gives 1░ in

68 feet.

Radstock Collieries, near Bath (XIV.), witb a depth of 1,000 feet, give

a doubtful average of 1░ in between 60 and 70 feet, the results in different

Weparts being irregular.  have adopted 1░ in 62 feet.

Fowlee's Collieet, Ponttpeidd, with a depth of 8-55 feet, gave, by one

observation at the bottom compared vpith the known surface-temperature,

a rate of 1░ in 76 feet.

Professor Phillips' observations in Monkwearmouth Colliery, published

in ' Phil. Mag.' for December 1834, showed a temperature of 71░2 in a hole

bored in the floor of a recently exposed part at the depth of 1,584 feet.

The surface of the ground is 87 feet above high water, and the mean

temperature of the air is assumed by Professor Phillips to be 47░'6. If, as

usual, we add 1" to get the soil temperature, instead of assuming, as

Professor Phillips does, that the temperature 100 feet deep is identical

with the air temperature at the surface, we obtain a rate of increase of

1░ in 70 feet.

3. The following are the most trustworthy results from wells and

borings :

The Sperenberg bore, near Berlin (IX. 204), in rock salt, with a depth

of 3,492 English feet, to the deepest reliable observation, gave an average

of 1░ in 51'5 feet. This result is entitled to special weight, not only on

account of the great depth, but also on account of the powerful means

employed to exclude convection.

Rock salt, according to Professor Herschel, has the very high conduc-

tivity -0113.

     Three artesian wells in the chalk of the Paris Basix gave the following-

results (IV. 24) :--

Military School

    The great well of La Chapelle, in the same basin, is not yet finished,
and a very great change in its indications may be expected when it

strikes the strong springs which it is intended to bring to the surface.

Up to the present time the deepest observation has been at 2,165 feet,

and this, by comparison with the known temperature in the artificial caves

under the Paris Observatory, gives a rate of 1░ in 90-5 feet, which is

probably much slower than the truth, by reason of convection. The

temperature at 328 feet compared with that at 2,1 65 feet, gives 1░ in

111 feet, this result being affected by convection at both ends.

   An artesian well at St. Petersburg (IV. 22), in the Lower Silurian

strata, with a depth of 656 feet, gives about 1░ in 44 feet.

   A -well sunk at Takoutsk, in Siberia (IV. 22), to the depth of 540 feet,

disclosed the fact that the ground -was permanently frozen to this depth,
and probably to the depth of 700 feet. The rate of increase of tempera-

ture -was 1░ in 52 feet.

     Of the English wells in which observations have been taken, the most

important is that at Kentish Town (II., III., IV.), in which Mr. G. J.
Symons, F.R.S., has taken observations to the depth of 1,100 feet. The

temperatures at different depths form a smooth series, and have been con-
fii'med by observations repeated at long intervals. The only question that

can arise as to the accuracy of the results is the possibility of their being
affected by convection.
           ON THE BATE OF INCREASE OF UNDERGROUND TEJU'ERATURE. 85

       The well is 8 feet in diameter, with brickwork to the depth of 540 feet,
  and this part of it is traversed by an iron tube 8 inches in diameter, which
  is continued to the depth of more than 1,300 feet from the surface. The

  tube is choked with mud to the depth of about 1,080 feet, so that the

  deepest observations were taken under 20 feet of mud. The temperature
  at 1,100 feet was 69░"9, and by combining this with the surface temperature
  of 49░'9 observed at the Botanic Gardens, Regent's Park, we obtain a rate
  of 1░ in 55 feet. These data would give at 250 feet a calculated tem-

  peratui'e of 54'5, whereas the temperature actually observed at this depth
  was 56'1, or 1░"6 higher; the temperature at 300 feet and at 350 feet being
  also 56'1. This seems to indicate convection, but it can be accounted for
 by convection in the 8-foot well which surrounds the tube, and does not
 imply convection currents within the tube. Convection currents are

 much more easily formed in water columns of large diameter than in small
 ones, and the 20 feet of mud at the bottom give some security against

 convection at the deepest point of observation. It is important to remark
 that the increase from 1,050 to 1,100 feet is rather less than the average,
 instead of being decidedly greater, as it would be if there were convection

 above, but not in, the mud. The rate of 1░ in 55 feet may therefore be

 adopted as correct.

      Mr. Symons also made numerous observations in this well (VI., TX.,

 XII.) to determine whether the temperature at the depth of 1,000 feet
 remained exactly the same at all seasons and from year to year. The
 result was that the changes, if any, were so small as not to be distinguish-

able from the necessaiy errors of observation. The research was finally
 abandoned, because the gradual silting up of the well, which was found
 to be going on, would itself be competent to account for any small secular
change that might have been detected by further observation.

      The strata, consisting of tertiary sti-ata, chalk (586 feet thick), upper
 greensand and gault, are given in detail on the last page of the third

 report.

     The Kentish Town temperature at the depth of 400 feet (58░) is con-

firmed by observations in Mr. Sich's well at Chiswick (VIII. 159), which
is 395 feet deep, and has a temperature varying from 58░ to 57░'5.

     The BoOTLE well, belonging to the Liverpool Waterworks, is 1,302 feet
deep, and the observations were taken in it during the sinking (XI., XII.)
The diameter of the bore is 24 inches, and convection might have been
suspected but for the circumstance that there was a gradual upward flow
of water from the bottom, which escaped from the upper part of the well
by percolation to an underground reservoir near at hand. This would
check the tendency to downflow of colder water from the top ; and as the
observations of temperature were always made at the bottom, they would

thus be protected against convective disturbance.

     The temperature at 226 feet was 52░, at 750 feet 56░, at 1,302 feet
59░, giving hj comparison of the first and last of these a mean rate of 1░
in 154 feet. The circumstance that the boring ceased for six weeks at
the depth of 1,004 feet, and the temperature fell during this interval from
58░'l, to 57░"0, would seem to indicate an elevation of 1░ due to the heat

generated by the boring tool. An assumed surface temperature of 49░

(only 0░-9 lower than that of the Botanic Gardens in London), would give
by comparison with 57░, at 1,004 feet, a rate of 1░ in 125^ feet, and by
comparison with 59░, at 1,302 feet, a rate of 1░ in 130 fe'et, which last

may be adopted as the best determination. The rock consists of the
86 BEPORT-- 1882.

pebble beds of the Bunter or Lower Trias, and the boring was executed at

the rate of nearly 100 feet per month.

     The boring at Swinderby, near Scaele (Lincoln), in search of coal

--(VIII., IX.), was carried to a depth of 2,000 feet, with a diameter at the

lower part of only 3^ inches a circumstance favourable to accuracy, both
as impeding convection and as promoting the rapid escape of the heat of
boring. The temperature at the bottom was 79░, the water having been

undisturbed for a month, and this by comparison with an assumed surface
temperature of 50░ gives a rate of 1░ in 69 feet.

    The rocks are Lower Lias, New Red Marl (569 feet thick), New Eed

Sandstone (790 feet thick). Red Marl, and earthy Limestone.
     The following results have been obtained from shallow borings. The

first three were made under Sir William Thomson's direction, with a
thermometer which could be read by estimation to hundredths of a

degree :

     Bltthswood bore, near Glasgow (I.), with a depth of 347 feet, gave a
very regular increase of 1░ in 50 feet.

     KiRKLAND Neuk bore, in the immediate vicinity of the above (II.),

gave consistent observations at difPerent seasons of the year from 180 feet
to the bottom (354 feet), the rate being 1░ in 53 feet. This bore passed

through coal which had been ' very much burned or charred.'

     South Balgeat bore, near Glasgow, and north of the Clyde, with an

available depth of 625 feet, gave, by comparing the temperature at the
bottom with that at 60 feet, a rate of 1░ in 41 feet.

Shale extends continuously from 390 to 450 feet from the surface, and

the increase in these 60 feet of shale was 2░-02, which is at the rate of
1░ in 30 feet. This rapid increase agrees with the fact that shale has
very low conductivity, averaging -0019 in Professor Herschel's experi-

ments.

     The only small bore remaining to be mentioned is that at Manegaon,

in India (X. 198), which had 310 feet available, and gave by comparing
the temperature at this depth with that at 60 feet a rate of 1░ in 68 feet.
The rocks consist of fine softish sandstones and hard siltJv clayJs,' the difp
being 10░.

     The following results, obtained from observations at the bottom of

shafts with only a small depth of water, are not altogether without value,

^ihough the circumstances are not favourable to accuracy :

    Two shafts of salt mines near Cakrickfergus (Ireland) (II. 12, 13),

with depths of 570 feet and 770 feet, gave by comparison with an assumed

surface temperature of 48░ rates of 1░ in 40 feet and 1░ in 43 feet. The

sod in both cases was yellow clay, a substance for which Professor

Herschel finds the low conductivity of "0025.

In  a  ' sump                                at  the  bottom  of  Slitt  mine,  in  the  Allenheads  lead
                                          '

mines, Weardale (Northumberland) (IV.), at 660 feet from the surface,

the temperature 65░-0 was found, which, by comparison with the surface

temperature, 45░-3, assumed by the observer (Mr. Burns, of H.M. Geo-

logical Survey), being a degree higher than the observed air temperature

in the neighbourhood, gives a rate of 1░ in 34 feet. The strata consist

of alternate beds of sandstone and shale, with a few beds of limestone,

4. Tunnels.--The Mont Cenis tunnel (IV. 15), which is about 7 miles

long, is at a depth of exactly a mile (5,280 feet) beneath the crest of Mont

Frejus overhead. This was the warmest part of the tunnel, and had a
           ON TUE RATE OF II^CREASE OF UNDEllGROUND TEMPERATURE. 87

  temperature of 85░1 F. The mean air temperature at the crest overhead
  was calculated by the engineer of the tunnel, M. Giordano, by interpolating
  between the known temperature of the pass of San Theodule and that of
  the city of Turin, the former being 430 metres higher, and the latter

  2,650 metres lower, than the point in question. It is thus calculated to

 --be 2░-6 C. or 27░'3 F. If, according to our usual rule, we assume the

  ground to be 1░ warmer than the air, we have 28░-3 to compare with 85░-l.

  This gives a rate of 1' in 93 feet ; but, inasmuch as the convexity of the
  surface increases the distance between the isotherms, a correction will be

 necessary before we can fairly compare this result with rates under level
 ground. As a rough estimate we may take Д of 93, and adopt 1░ in 79 feet

  as the corrected result.

      * The rocks on which the observations have been made are absolutely
 the same, geologically and otherwise, from the entrance to the tunnel, on
 the Italian side, for a distance of nearly 10,000 yards. They are not
 faulted to any extent, though, highly inclined, contorted, and subjected to
 slight slips and slides. They consist, to a very large extent indeed, of
 silicates, chiefly of alumina, and the small quantity of lime they contain

 is a crystalline carbonate.'

      The St. Gothaed Tunnel (VIII., XI., XII.), which has a length of
 about 9 miles, has been subjected to much more minute observation, a
 skilled geologist. Dr. StapiF, having, under Government direction, devoted

 bis whole time to investigating its geology and physics. He not only

 observed the temperature of the rock in the tunnel at very numerous
 points, but also determined, by observations of springs, the mean tempera-
 tures of the surface of the mountain at various points, and compared
 these with an empirical formula for air temperature deduced from the-
 known mean temperatures of the air at Gbschenen, Andermatt, Airolo,

and the Hospice of St. Bernard. He infers from bis comparisons a con-

 siderable excess of soil above air temperature, increasing from 2░ C. at the
 ends of the tunnel to 6░ C. at the crest of the mountain over the centre
of the tunnel. The highest temperature of the rocks in the tunnel was
at this central part, and was about 30░-6 C. or 87░ F. The soil tempera-

--ture at the crest above it was about 0░'6 C. or 31░ F., giving a difference-

of 56░ F. The height of the crest above sea-level was about 2,850 m., and

that of the tunnel at this part 1,150 m., giving a difference of 1,700 m^

or 5,578 feet. The rate of increase here is, therefore, about 1░ F. in 100-
feet ; and if we apply the same correction for convexity as in the case of
the Mont Cenis tunnel, this will be reduced to about 1░ F. in 87 feet, as
the equivalent rate under a level surface. From combining his observa-
tions in all parts of the tunnel, through the medium of empirical
formulEe, Dr. Stapff deduces an average rate of 1░ F. for every 88 feet
measured from the surface directly overhead. Where the surface is a
steep ridge, the increase was lesj rapid than this average ; where the sur-
face was a valley or plain, the increase was more rapid. As this average
merely applies to the actual temperatures, the application of a correction
for the general convexity of the surface would give a more rapid rate.
If we bring the isotherms nearer by one part in 15, which seems a fair
assumption, we shall obtain a rate of 1░ F. in 82 feet.

     Collecting together the foregoing results, and arranging them mainly
in the order of their rates of increase, but also with some reference to
locality, we have the following list :

 Sfc. Gotharrl tunnel and for the numerous deep mines of the East Man-

 Chester coalfield, will have only a trifling effect on the rates of increase

 assigned to these localities.

     To obtain an approximation to the rate at which heat escapes annually
from the earth, we will first reduce the above rate of increase "01566 to
Centigrade degrees per centimetre of depth. For this purpose we must
multiply by -0182, giving -000285.

     To calculate the rate of escape of heat, this must be multiplied by the

conductivity.

     The most certain determinations yet made of the conductivity of a

portion of the earth's substance are those deduced by Sir William

Thomson by an indirect method, involving observations of underground

thermometers at three stations at Edinburgh, combined with laboratory
measurements of the specific heats and densities of the rocks in which
the thermometers were planted. The specific heats were determined by
Regnault, and the densities by Forbes. Specific heats and densities can
be determined with great accuracy in the laboratory, but the direct
determination of conductivity in the laboratory is exceedingly difficult, it

being almost impossible to avoid sources of error which make the con-

ductivity appear less than it really is.

      Professor Herschel, in conjunction with a Committee of the British
Association, has made a very extensive and valuable series of direct
measurements of the conductivities of a great variety of rocks, and
has given additional certainty to his results by selecting as two of the
subjects of his experiments the Calton Hill trap and Craigleith sand-
stone, to which Sir "William Thomson's determinations apply. Comparison
shows that Professor Herschel's results for these two substances, as given
in the fifth Report of the Conductivity Committee (1878), must be multi-

plied by about 1"4 to make them agree with Sir William Thomson's.'
     The following list, condensed from that Report, will be useful for our

purpose :

we have

     This then is our estimate of the average number of gramme-degrees
of heat that escape annually through each square centimetre of a hori-

zontal section of the earth's substance.

Report of the Committee, consist! nr/ of Professor Schuster (Secre-
   tary), Sir William Thomson, Professor H. E. Eoscoe, Professor

   A. S. Heeschel, Captain W. de W. Abney, Mr. E. H. Scott, and

   Dr. J. H. Gladstone, appointed for the purpose of investigating
   the practicability of collecting and identifying Meteoric Dust,

   and of considering the question of undertaking regular observa-

   tions in various localities.

1. In their first Report the Committee confined itself to giving a short
abstract of some of the work which had hitherto been done to clear up the
important question with which they are concerned. Since that time the
previous literature has been more thoroughly studied, and a microscopic
investigation of different specimens of magnetic dust derived from various
sources has been undertaken.

    A good deal of the literature confines itself to the dust-falls which

are frequently observed in the Atlantic, in the southern parts of Italy,

and sometimes in the Red Sea. These dust-falls were at one time sup-
posed to be of meteoric origin, but it has now been conclusively proved

that the dust has its origin in the sandy deserts of Northern Africa,
whence it is carried by the winds often through considerable distances

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

the grosser particles falling down first, so that ultimately only the finest
remain in suspension. With these dust-falls we are not directly con-
cerned, but we wish to point out that because as a whole they are proved

to be of terrestrial origin it does not follow that everything they contain

is terrestrial. Granting for a moment that meteoric dust exists, that
dust would accumulate in the desert as well as anywhere else, we should
expect that some of the magnetic particles carried hj these dust-storms
would show the same peculiarities which, in other cases, have led to the
supposition of their meteoric origin. Such indeed is the case ; but before
entering into details on this point we must give a short account of the
very clear line of argument by means of which Tissandier has to most

minds established the existence and general prevalence of meteoric dust.

      Tissandier has fully discussed the question in his interesting little

book 'Les poussieres de I'air,'' and has described the result of the micro-

scopic examination of the dust gradually settled down in dry weather, or

                                             ' Paris, Gauthier Villars, 1877.

Weprecipitated by rain and snow.                          are concerned here chiefly with the

magnetic particles contained in this dust. These particles are of various

shapes, but the most remarkable form is perfectly spherical, which at
once conveys the obvious information that the particles at one time must

have been in a state of fusion. These spherules have been found in the

snows on the slopes of Mont Blanc, at a height of nearly 9,000 feet in the

sediment of rain collected at the Observatory of Sainte-Marie-du-Mont,

and in the dust collected at different elevated positions. There are other

particles, not spherical but of equally characteristic forms, which generally

accompany these spherules, and some of these shapes we find in the

iron dust extracted by Nordenskjold from the sand of the polar regions.

If we confine ourselves, however, at present to the spherical particles,
and accept the conclusion that they have been in a state of fusion, we
are practically reduced to three alternatives. The particles may be of

volcanic origin, they raay have been fused in our terrestrial fires, or they

may be meteoric. All the volcanic dust which the writer has had at his

disposal was carefully examined under the microscope, and its appearance

was found to be altogether diffei'ent from the supposed meteoric dust.

Such also seems to be the conclusion arrived at by Tissandier. No iron

spherules have, as far as I know, been found in volcanic dust.

The smoke issuing from the chimneys of our manufacturing towns

can and does contain iron particles similar in appearance to those to

which Tissandier ascribes a meteoric origin. That some of these particles

are found very far from any terrestrial sources which can produce them

would not perhaps tell conclusively against their terrestrial origin, but

chemical analysis seems to settle the point. The iron particles issuing

from our chimneys contain neither nickel nor cobalt ; while these metals

were found by Tissandier to exist in the microscopic magnetic particles

found in rain-water collected at the Observatory of Sainte-Marie-du-Mont.

We are, therefore, driven to ascribe a cosmic origin to these particles.

    2. The author of this Report has, during the last year, made a few

microscopic investigations of small iron particles found in different places.

can be no doubt that they form an integral

part of the sand, and are due to the debris

some of them are even larger. Fig. 1 shows
some of these spherules as seen under the microscope. Figs. 2 and 3

     The greater part of these latter particles are metallic iron, as is shown

by the deposition of copper on them when a drop of a solution of sulphate

of copper is added. In fig. 2 all the light parts represent the metallic

iron. The total quantity of this metallic iron must, however, have been

small, for it could not be traced by chemical analysis.

shooting star is not an uncommon phenomenon, and on certain nights in
the year we often find them counted by hundreds. Each of these meteors

will leave traces behind in our atmosphere, for it seems hardly possible

that when white hot, owing to the friction with our atmosphere, part of

this surface should not fuse and be left behind in a finely divided state.
         ON MKTEOEIC DUST.                                  93

In addition to this we also hear of larger meteors passing through the
air more slowly, but leaving behind trains of luminous clouds remaining
visible for a considerable length of time. What becomes of all this
matter, and how should we expect it to look after it has settled down on

the surface of our earth ? Tissandier has examined microscopically some
powder which he has detached from the surface of a meteoric stone found
in Bohemia, and it was found to resemble in appearance the magnetic

particles found in different places to which he had attributed a meteoric

origin.

4. An interesting question arises in connection with the iron particles

which are found in the metallic state in the sand of the desert of Sahara

Howand in other localities.  did they escape oxidation, either when first

detached from the molten mass of the meteoric dust, or subsequently.

Several explanations of this fact may be offered. If the particles are

really meteoric they would contain a considerable proportion of nickel,

and such iron is able to resist oxidation to a high degree. But the pre-

sence of nickel would not prevent their transformation into magnetic

oxide when red hot, as they must have been when they separated from

the meteor. I wish, however, to point out that possibly, and even pro-

bably, the separation has taken place at a height at which the atmosphere

contains only comparatively small quantities of oxygen. It is known by

the laws of diffusion that, assuming everything to be in a state of equili-

brium, each gas will form an atmosphere round the terrestrial globe

independently of any other gas which may be present. It follows that at

great heights the lighter gases will be present in preponderating propor-

tions, as compared with the lower regions. Calculating, for instance, the

proportion of oxygen which we should expect at different heights if the

temperature is the same throughout, we find as follows :

         At a height of kilometres 21 per cent, of oxygen.

         5,,                 ,,  19'5  ,,  ,,

         ,, 200              ,,  0-8

     Convection currents would, no doubt, especially within the lower
regions, tend to equalise the difference between the higher and lower
parts, but the fact must remain that, at a height at which luminous,
meteors have been seen luminous, the oxygen can only form a small
fraction of the atmosphere. But matters become still more striking if

we consider that probably some other and lighter gas is present in ad-

dition to the oxygen and nitrogen.
     Spectroscopic observations of the Aurora Borealis show the presence

of a green line which no one has as yet obtained from any known constituent

of the atmosphere. I have myself observed nitrogen, and oxygen and

some of the carbon compounds, under so many different conditions that
I am fully convinced that the line is not due to them, but must be due to
the presence of some unknown gaseous body. As we cannot detect it

near the surface of the earth, this gas must be very light. Supposing, for
the sake of argument, that it is as dense as hydrogen, and that at the surface

of the earth its quantity per cubic centimetre is only the millionth part

of the oxygen present in the same space, it would certainly escape all our

methods of analysis. But from these suppositions we can calculate that,
94 EEPOBT-- 1882.

--at a height of 200 kilometres, it must exceed the oxygen in proportion of

170,000 to 1 that is to say, at that height the atmosphere would practi-

 cally contain no oxygen. If the gas is less dense than hydrogen this

 proportion would still further be increased. Even those who do not feel
 inclined to assume the presence of an unknown gas will not deny the
 possibility that free hydrogen may be present in our atmosphere in such
 small quantities as we have assumed. Electric discharges which are

и constantly going on partially decompose the aqueous vapour of the

atmosphere, and some of it will escape recombination. If then free
hydrogen exists even in quantities only which are very small on the

surface of the earth, it may be hi preponderating proportion in the upper

regions.

     After having considered the above explanation of the fact that some

of the meteoric iron may be in the metallic state, I have made a few
experiments which tend to show that iron dust may separate from a red-

hot meteor even in atmosphere containing considerable quantities of

oxygen, and yet escape oxidation. Tissandier has shown how by burning
an iron wire in oxygen we may often obtain iron spherules of exactly

the same nature as those floating in our atmosphere. I have obtained
similar spherules by using an iron file as one pole of a dynamo-machine,

and pas.sing the file over a copper wire connected with the other pole.

The sparks flying off in all directions are found to consist chiefly of iron

globules  like  those  to  which Tissandier ascribes a meteoric origin                                                                                                                                                                                               but
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

in addition we have small spongy masses which are metallic, and present

exactly the same appearance as the metallic iron found in the Saharah
desert. The most remarkable fact, however, is this, that we find even a
few globules of iron which are metallic. These globules must have been

in a state of f asion, and yet they did not oxidise at the contact of the air,
no doubt owing to the fact that a large number of particles used up the

free oxygen of the air in the neighbourhood of the few particles which

thus escaped,

     5. The question of meteoric dust suggests another interesting reflec-
tion. Mr. Aitken has recently shown how a condensation of aqueous

vapour only takes place round a nucleus of solid matter. It is no doubt
one of the most interesting questions to decide what forms in different

Welocalities the most common nucleus for fogs, rain, snow, or hail.

conclude this Report by mentioning the very suggestive fact, that

Nordenskjold has found iron particles as a nucleus to hailstones at Stock-

holm, and that observations of the same kind have been made in Spain,

where also hailstones were found to contain iron particles as a nucleus.

Other observations of the same nature seem to exist.

     There is every reason to believe that the blue colour of the sky is due

to minute particles scattering the light. These particles must be much

more minute than any which the Committee has at present investigated

they must, in fact, be beyond the limits of microscopic power. It might,

however, be possible ultimately to find out the nature of these small

particles. It is interesting to record the observation made by the author

of this Report, that in the valleys of the Himalayas which are cultivated,

the colour of the sky is much whiter than in the valleys which are

barren and devoid of any vegetation.
ON THE MEASUBEMENT OF THE LUNAU DISTURBANCE OF GBAVITY. 95

Second Report of the CoviTtiittee, consisting of Mr. Gr. H. Darwin,
   Professor Sir William Thomson, Professor Tait, Professor Grant,

   Dr. Siemens, Professor Purser, Professor Gr. Forbes, aoid Mr.

   Horace Darwin, appointed for the Measurement of the Lunar

   Disturbance of Gravity. Written by Mr. Gr. H. Darwin.

     Shortly after the meeting of the British Association last year (1881),

the instrument with which my brother and I were experimenting at the

Cavendish Laboratory, at Cambridge, broke down, through the snapping

Aof the wire which supported the pendulum.  succession of unforeseen

circumstances have prevented us, up to the present time, from resuming

our experiments.

The body of the present Report, therefore, will merely contain an

account of such observations by other observers as have come to our

knowledge within the past year, and it must be taken as supplementary to

the second part of the Report for 1881 . The Appendix, however, contains

certain theoretical investigations, which appear to me to throw doubt

on the utility of very minute gravitational observations.

The readers of the Report for 1881 will remember that, in the course

of our experiments, we were led away from the primary object of the

Committee, namely the measurement of the Lunar Disturbance of Gravity,

and found ourselves compelled to investigate the slower oscillations of

the soil.

It would be beyond the scope of the present Report to enter on the

literature of seismology. But, the slower changes in the vertical having

been found to be intimately connected with earthquakes, it would not

have been possible, even if desirable, to eliminate all reference to seismo-

logy from the present Report.

The papers which are quoted below present evidence of a very mis-

cellaneous character, and therefore this Report must necessarily be rather
disjointed. It has seemed best in our account of work done rather to

classify together the observers than the subjects. This rule will, however,

be occasionally departed from, when it may seem desirable to do so.

     The interesting researches in this field made during the last ten years
by the Italians, are, I believe, but little known in this country, and as the

accounts of their investigations are not easily accessible (there being, for

example, no copy of the 'Bulletino' referred to below at Cambridge), it

will be well to give a tolerably full account of the results attained. I

have myself only seen the ' Transactions ' for four years.

The great extension which these investigations have attained in Italy

has been no doubt due to the fact of the presence of active volcanos and
of frequent sensible earthquakes in that country. But it is probable that

many of the same phenomena occur in all countries.

     In 1874 the publication of the ' Bulletino del Vulcanismo Italiano '

was commenced at Rome under the editorship of Professor S. M. de

Rossi, of Rome.' As the title of this publication shows, it is principally
occupied with accounts of earthquakes, but the extracts made will refer

almost entirely to the slower oscillations of level.

    ' I am compelled to make this abstract from manuscript notes ; but my papers
having become somewhat disarranged, I am not absolutely certain, in one or two

places, of the year to which the observations refer.
96 REPORT-- 1882.

     I learn from the ' Bulletino ' that in 1873 Professor Timoteo Bertelli,
of Florence, had published an historical account of small spontaneous
movements of the pendulum, observed since the seventeenth century up to

that time.'

     In 1874 (Anno 1 of the ' Bulletino ') Rossi draws attention to the
fact that there are periods lasting from a few days to a week or more, in
which the soil is in incessant movement, followed by a comparative cessation
of such movement. This he calls a 'seismic period.' In the midst or at
the end of a seismic period there is frequently a sensible earthquake.

     At page 51 he remarks, in a review of some observations of Professor
Pietro Monte (Director of the Observatory of Leghorn), that he was led
to suspect that the crust of the earth is in continuous and slow movement
during the seismic period, and that this movement is influenced by varia-
tions of barometric pressure. This suspicion was, he says, confirmed by
finding, in his observations of a pendulum at Rocca di Papa (of which
we shall speak again below), that during the seismic period the excursions
of the pendulum were mostly in the S.W. and N.E. azimuth. This is
perpendicular to the volcanic fracture, which runs towards the Alban
lake and the sea. The lips of the fracture rise and fall, and there result
two sets of waves along and perpendicular to the fracture. In an earth-
quake these waves are propagated with great velocity (the phenomenon
being in fact dynamical), but during the seismic period the same class of

changes takes place slowly. This view accords with observations at

Velletri made by Professor D. G. Galli.
     With regard to the influence of barometric pressure Rossi elsewhere

quotes M. Poey (October 15, 1857 ?) as having attributed the deviations
of the vertical to this cause, and remarks :

     ' Although he (Poey) gave too much weight to the baro-seismic action

of large variations of atmospheric pressure, yet after very numerous ob-

servations made by me in these last three years (I suppose 1871-4), I

can affirm that no marked barometric depression has occurred without
having been immediately preceded, accompanied, or followed by marked
micro-seismic movements ; but besides these there are other irregular,
often considerable and instantaneous movements, which occur under high
pressure. To distinguish them, I have called the first baro-seismic, and
the second vulcano-seismic, movements.' The reader will find a theoretical
investigation on this subject in the Appendix to the present Report.

     Rossi states (page 118, Anno 1 ?) that whilst Etna was in a condition
of activity his pendulums at Rocca di Papa were extraordinarily agitated

at the beginning of each barometric storm.

     At page 90 of the second year are given graphical illustrations of the
simultaneous deflections of pendulums at Rome, Rocca di Papa, Florence,
Leghorn, and Bologna. There is some appearance of concordance between
them, and this shows that the agitations sometimes affect considerable
tracts of land, but that the minor deflections are purely local phenomena.

     M. d'Abbadie, in presenting a memoir on micro-seismic movements
by Father Bertelli to the French Academy, relates (' Comptes Rendus,'
1875, vol. 81, p. 297) the following experiment made by Count Malvasia,
as proving the independence of the disturbances of the pendulum from

the tremors produced by traffic. Two batteries of artillery were marching

through Bologna, and it was arranged that at 30 meters from the Palazzo

Malvasia they should break into a trot. The pendulum, situated only 6

meters from the street, was observed to be unaffected by this, and continued

Aits oscillations in the B.W. azimuth.  pool of mercury was violently

agitated, and it was concluded that the motion communicated to the

ground by the artillery was exclusively vertical.

At page 5 of the ' Bulletino ' for 1876 (January to May), Rossi

writes a ' Guida pratica per le osservazioni sismiche.' This article con.

tains a description of the instruments which have been used by the

Italian observers.

Bertelli used a pendulum protected from the air, with a microscope

and micrometer for. evaluating the oscillations. The upper part of the
support of the pendulum consisted of a spiral spring, so that vertical

movements of the ground could be recorded. This instrument he calls a

tromo-seismometer.

     Professor Kgidi, of Anagni, proposed to use the reflection from mer-
cury. The object observed was to be a mark fixed on a wall, and the

reflected image of the mark was to be observed with a telescope. The

deviation of the vertical was to be evaluated by noting the amount of
movement required to bring the cross-wires of the telescope on to the

mark. This instrument has not, I think, the advantages of M. d'Abbadie's,
because the light was incident at about 45░ on the mercury, and thus
the mark and telescope were remote from one another ; whereas in the
arrangement of M. d'Abbadie the mark and microscope are close together,
and only a micrometer wire in the microscope is movable.

     Cavalleri used ten pendulums of graduated length, and found that
sometimes one of the pendulums was agitated and sometimes another.

Rossi observed the same with his pendulums at Rocca di Papa. It thus
appears that the free period of oscillation of the pendulum is a disturbing

element.

     In order to obviate the discrepancies which must arise in the use of
various kinds of pendulums for simultaneous observations in different

places, Bertelli and Rossi propose a normal ' tromometer,' of which a
drawing is given. The length of the pendulum is 1^ meters, the weight
100 grammes, and it makes forty-nine free oscillations in a minute. To
the bottom of the pendulum is attached a horizontal disk, on the under-

side of which are engraved two fine lines at right-angles to one another.

These lines are observed, after total internal reflection in a glass prism

placed immediately below the disk, by a horizontal microscope, f-irnished
with a micrometer. The azimuth of the deflection of the vertical is
observed by a position-circle.

     This paper also contains a description of the author's observatory at
Rocca di Papa. It is established in a cave at 700 meters above the sea, on

the external slope of the extinct Latian volcano. There is a large central

l^endulum hanging from the roof, and there ai'e four others with dif-

ferent weights and lengths hanging in tubes cut in the native rock. Only

the ends of these pendulums are visible, and they are protected by glass at

Athe visible parts. great part of this paper is occupied with descriptions

of seismometers, and this is outside the scope of the present Report.

     In presenting a pamphlet by Father Bertelli, entitled ' Riassunto delle

osservazioni microsismiche, &c.,' to the Academy (' Comptes Rendus,'

1877, vol. 84, p. 465), M. d'Abbadie summarises Bertelli's conclusions
somewhat as follows :

1882.               H
--98 BEPORX 1882.

     The oscillation of the pendulum is generally parallel to valleys or
chains of mountains in the neighbourhood. The oscillations are indepen-
dent of local tremors, velocity and direction of wind, rain, change of

temperature, and atmospheric electricity.
     Pendulums of different lengths betray the movements of the soil in

different manners, according to the agreement or disagreement of their

free-periods with the period of the terrestrial vibrations.

     The disturbances are not strictly simultaneous in the different towns

of Italy, but succeed one another at short intervals.

     After earthquakes the ' tromometric ' or microseismic movements are
especially apt to be in a vertical direction. They are always so when the
earthquake is local, but the vertical movements are sometimes absent
when the shock occurs elsewhei'e. Sometimes there is no movement at
all, even when the shock occurs quite close at hand.

     The positions of the sun and moon appear to have some influence on
the movements of the pendulum, but the disturbances are especially fre-
qnent when the barometer is low.

     The curves of ' the monthly means of the tromometric movement
exhibit the same forms in the various towns of Italy, even those which

are distant from one another.

    The maximum of disturbance occurs near the winter solstice and
the minimum near the summer solstice ; this agrees with Mallet's results

about earthquakes.

     At Florence a period of earthquakes is presaged by the magnitude
and frequency of pendulous movements in a vertical direction. These
movements are observable at intervals and during several hours after

     At page 103 of the first part of the ' Bulletino ' for 1878 (?), there is
a review of a work by Giulio Grablovitz, ' Dell' attrazione luni-solare in
relatione coi fenomeni mareo-sismici,' MUano, Tipografia degli Ingegneri,

1877.

     In this work it appears that M. Grablovitz attributes a considerable

part of the deviations of the vertical to bodily tides in the earth, but as
he apparently enters into no computations to show the competency of
this cause to produce the observed effects, it does not seem necessary to

make any further comment on his views.
     At page 99 of the volume for September-December, 1878, Eossi

writes on the use of the microphone for the purpose of observing earth-

quakes (' II microfono nella meteorologia endogena '). He begins by

"иivino- an account of a correspondence, beginning in 187'i>, between him-

self and Count Giovanni Mocenigo,' of Vicenza, who seems to have been

very near to the discovery of the microphone. When the invention of

the microphone was announced, Mocenigo and Armellini adopted it for
their experiments, and came to the conclusion that the mysterious noises
which they heard arose from minute earthquakes or microisms.

      Rossi then determined to undertake observations in his cavern at

Rocca di Papa, with a microphone, made of silver instead of carbon,
mounted on a stone beam. The sensitiveness of the instrument could be
regulated, and he found that it was not much influenced by external

noises.

     The instrument was placed 20 meters underground, and remote from

It is reviewed in Nature for July 6, 1882.

houses and carriage-roads. It was protected against insects, and was
wrapped up in wool. Carpet was spread on the floor of the cave to deaden
the noise from particles of stone which might possibly fall. Having
established his microphone, he waited till night and then heard noises
which he says revealed ' natural telluric phenomena.' The sounds which

he heard he describes as ' roarings, explosions occurring isolated or in

volleys, and metallic or bell-like sounds ' [fremiti, scopii isolati o di
moschetteria, e suoni metallici o di campana] . They all occurred mixed

indiscriminately, and rose to maxima at irregular intervals. By artificial

means he was able to cause noises which he calls ' rumbling (?) ov
crackling ' [rullo o crepito]. The roaring [fremito] was the only noise
which he could reproduce artificially, and then only for a moment.
It was done by rubbing together the conducting wires, in the same
manner as the rocks must rub against one another when there is an

earthquake.

   A mine having been exploded in a quarry at some distance, the

tremors in the earth were audible in the microphone for some seconds

subsequently.

There was some degree of coincidence between the agitation of the

pendulum-seismograph and the noises heard with the microphone.

     At a time when Vesuvius became active, Rocca di Papa was agitated

by microsisms, and the shocks were found to be accompanied by the
very same microphonic noises as before. The noises sometimes became

' intolerably loud ; ' on one occasion in the middle of the night, half an

hour before a sensible earthquake. The agitation of the microphone

corresponded exactly with the activity of Vesuvius.

     Rossi then transported his microphone to Palmieri's Vesnvian ob-

servatory, and worked in conjunction with him. He there found that

each class of shock had its corresponding noise. The sussultorial shocks,
in which I conceive the movement of the ground is vertically up and
down, gave the volleys of musketry [i colpi di moschetteria], and the

undulatory shocks gave the roarings [i fremiti]. The two classes of

noises were sometimes mixed up together.

Rossi makes    the  following remarks :   '  On Vesuvius I was  put ii>

                                                                                    ^

the way of discovering that the simple fall and rise in the ticking

which occurs with the microphone [battito del orologio unito al

microfono] (a phenomenon observed by all, and remaining inexplicable

to all) is a consequence of the vibration of the ground.' This passage

alone might perhaps lead one to suppose that clockwork was included in

the circuit ; but that this was not the case, and that ' ticking ' is merely
a mode of representing a natural noise, is proved by the fact that he

subsequently says that he considers the ticking to be 'a telluric

phenomenon.'
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      .
     Rossi then took the microphone to the Solfatara of Pozzuoli, and

here, although no sensible tremors were felt, the noises were so loud as
to be heard simultaneously by all the people in the room. The tickmg
was quite masked by other natural noises. The noises at the Solfatara
were imitated by placing the microphone on a vessel of boiling water.
Other seismic noises were then imitated by placing the microphone on a

marble slab, and scratching and tapping the under surface of it.
     The observations on Vesuvixis led him to the conclusion that the

earthquake oscillations have sometimes fixed nodes and loops, for there
were places on the mountain where no eflPects were observed. Hence, as

                                                        H2

he remarks, although there may sometimes be considerable agitation in
an earthquake, the true centre of disturbance may be very distant.

     In conclasion Rossi gives a description of a good method of making

a microphone. A common nail has a short piece of copper wire wound

round it, and the other end of the wire is wound round a fixed metallic

support. The nail thus stands at the end of a weak horizontal spring

but the nail is arranged so that it stands inclined to the horizon, instead
of being vertical. The point of the nail is then put to rest on the middle

of the back of a silver watch, which lies flat on a slab. The two elec-

trodes are the handle of the watch and the metallic support. He says

that this is as good as any instrument. The telephone is a seismological

instrument, and therefore, strictly speaking, beyond the scope of this

Report ; but as some details of its use have already been given, I will
here quote portions of an interesting letter by Prof. John Milne, of the

Imperial Engineering College of Tokio, which appeared in ' Nature ' for

June 8, 1882. Mr. Milne writes :--

     ' In order to determine the presence of these earth-tremors, at the end

of 1879 I commenced a series of experiments with a variety of appai'atus,
amongst which were microphones and sets of pendulum apparatus, very

similar in general arrangement, but, unfortunately, not in refinement of

construction, to the arrangements now being used in the Cavendish

Laboratory.

' The microphones wei'e screwed on to the heads of stakes driven in

the ground, at the bottom of boxed-in pits. In order to be certain that

the records which these microphones gave were not due to local actions,

such as birds or insects, two distinct sets of apparatus were used, one

being in the middle of the lawn in the front of my house, and the other

in a pit at the back of the house. The sensitiveness of these may be

learnt frora the fact that if a small pebble was dropped on the grass

within six feet of the pit, a distinct sound was heard in the telephone,

and a swing produced in the needle of the galvanometer placed in con-

Anection with these microphones.       person running or walking in the

neighbourhood of the pits, had each of his steps so definitely recorded,

that a Japanese neighbour, Mr. Masato, who assisted me in the experi-

ments, caused the swinging needle of his galvanometer to close an

electric circuit and ring a bell, which, it is needless to say, would alarm a

household. In the contrivance we have a hint as to how earth- tremors
may be employed as thief-detectors.

     ' The pendulum apparatus, one of which consisted of a 20-lb. bob

of lead at the end of 20 feet of pianoforte wire provided with small galva-

nometer mirrors and bifilar suspensions, were also used in pairs. With

this apparatus a motion of the bob relatively to the earth was magnified

1,000 times, that is to say, if the spot of light which was reflected from
the mirror moved a distance equal to the thickness of a sixpence, this

indicated there had been a relative motion of the bob to the extent of

1,000th part that amount.

' The gi-eat evil which everyone has to contend with in Japan when

woi'king with delicate apparatus is the actual earthquakes, which stop

or alter the rate of ordinary clocks.

     ' Another evil which had to be contended with was the wind, which

shook the house in which my pendulums were supported, and I imagine
the ground by the motion of some neighbouring trees. A shower of rain

also was not without its eSects upon the microphones. After many

months of tiresome observation, and eliminating all motions which by any

possibility conld have been produced by local influence, the general result

obtained was that there wei'e movements to be detected every day and

sometimes many times per day. . . .

   A' great assistance to the interpretation of the various records which

an earthquake gives us on our seismographs is what I may call a barri-

cade of post-cards. At the present moment Yedo is barricaded, all the

towns around for a distance of 100 miles being provided with post-cards.

Everyone of them is posted with a statement of the shocks which have

been felt.

' For the months of October and November it was found from the

records of the post-cards that nearly all the shocks came from the north

and passed Yedo to the south-west. When coming in contact with a

high range of mountains, they were suddenly stopped, as was inferred

from the fact that the towns beyond this range did not perceive that an

earthquake had occurred. This fact having been obtained, the barricade

of post-cards has been extended to towns lying still farther north. The

result of this has been that several earthquake origins have, so to speak,

been surrounded or coralled, whilst others have been traced as far as the

seashore. For the latter shocks, earthquake-hunting with post-cards has

had to cease, and we have solely to rely upon our instruments. Having

obtained our earthquake centres, at one or more of these our tremor

instruments might be erected, and it would soon be known whether an

observation of earth-tremors would tell us about the coming of an earth-

quake as the cracklings of a bending do about its approaching breakage.

To render these experiments more complete, and to determine the exist-

ence of a terrain tide, a gravitimeter might be established. I mention

this because if terrain tides exist, and they are sufficiently great from a

geological point of view, it would seem that they might be more pro-

nounced and therefore easier to measure in a country like Japan, resting

in a heated and perhaps plastic bed, than in a country like England,

where volcanic activity has so long ceased, and the rocks are, compai'a-

tively speaking, cold and rigid, if an instrument, sufficiently delicate to

detect differences in the force of gravity, in consequence of our being

lifted farther from the centre of the earth every time by the terrain tide

as it passed between (sic) our feet, could be established in conjunction with

the experiments on earth-tremors.'

The only account which I have been able to find of M. Bouquet de

la Grye's observations (mentioned in the last Report) is contained in

the ' Comptes Rendus ' for March 22, 1875, page 725. M. Bouquet

writes :

'        .                             .  The observation of the levels of our meridian  telescopes put us
      .

on the track of a curious fact. Not only is Campbell Island subject to

earthquakes, but it also exhibits movements when the great swell falls in

breakers on the coast. I thought that it would be interesting to study

this new phenomenon. The instrument, which was quickly put together,

consisted of a steel wire supporting a weight, to which was soldered a

needle                                 the movements of the weight were  amplified 240 times  by means
                                    ;

of a lever ; by passing an electric current through this multiplying

pendulum, which was terminated at the bottom by a small cup of

amalgamated tin, regular oscillations of yJ^y^jth of a mm. could be re-

gistered. I propose to repeat these observations with a pendulum of
102 KEPORT 1882.

mucli larger amplifying power, so as to try to register the variations of
the plumb-line.'

   MIn a letter to me, d'Abbadie mentions an attempt by Brunner to

improve M. Bouquet de la Grje's apparatus, but considers that the attempt
 was a failure.

     He also tells me that Delaunay directed M. Wolf to devise an

 apparatus for detecting small deviations of the vertical, and that the
latter, without M. d'Abbadie's knowledge, adopted his rejected idea of
 a pendulum, about 30 meters long, bearing a prism at the end by
 reflection from which a scale was to be read by means of a distant small
 refractor. The pendulum was actually set up, but the wire went on
twisting and untwisting until Delaunay's death, and no observations were

made with it. Our own experience is enough to show that nothing could
 have been made of such an instrument.

     M. d'Abbadie gives further explanations of a passage in his own paper

about the arrangements for the staircases for access to and observation
with his Nadirane. In writing the Report of 1881 I had found the
description of the arrangements difficult to understand.

     The woodcut below is a copy of the rough diagram that he sent me.
      There were three staircases :

    BT cut in the rock; C to ascend from the cellar-flags C D; and, lastly,

A AS to mount from the boarded ground floor, B, to the small floor S N,

which was hung from the roof. The two upper staircases did not touch

the truncated cone of concrete anvwhere.

      Judging from this figure, I imagine that the concrete cone has an
external slope of ten in one, instead of one in ten as stated in last year's
Report ; the French expression was ' une inclinaison d'un dixieme.'

    M. d'Abbadie informs me that the apparently curious phenomenon of

the ' ombres fuyantes,' which were observed in the reflection from the
pool of mercury, to which we drew attention last year, was of no signifi-
cance. It arose from the currents of air caused by a candle left standing

on the staircase T cut in the rock. The light was required for pouring
ON THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LUNAR DISTURBANCE OF GRAVITY. 103

out the mercury, and it was left burning whilst the observation was being

taken ; but now that this operation is done entirely from above, the
phenomenon has disappeared.

In a paper entitled ' Recherches sur la Verticale ' (Ann. de la Soc.

Scient. de Bruxelles, 1881), M. d'Abbadie continues the account of his

observations with his instrument, called by him a Nadirane. It was

described in the last year's Report, and some further details have been given

Aabove.  portion of this paper refers to his old observations, and gives

further important details as to the exact method of making observations,

and of various modifications which have been introduced.

   --Each complete observation consists of the following processes :

measurement of the distance between the cross-wires and their image,

(1) in the meridian, (2) in the prime vertical, (3) in the N.W. azimuth,
(4) observation of barometer, (5) of thermometer, (6) of direction and
force of the wind, (7) condition and movement of the image estimated

with the micrometer, (8) condition of the heavens, (9) of the breakers
called 'les Criquets,' which can be observed from the neighbouring room.

This last is to determine whether it is possible to have a rough sea

with  a calm  image                                a  condition which  has  not  hitherto  been  observed.
                                                ;

This statement seems somewhat contradictory of the following :

' Aucunes des variations dans les circonstances coucomitantes n'a para

se rattacher a I'etat de I'image qui, pendant des journees entieres, parait

tantot belle, tantot faible, et parfois meme disparait entierement, bien que

ce dernier inconvenient ait ete evite en grande partie par I'usage d'un

recipient en bois a fond raine pour contenir le mercure.' I presume we

are to understand that the roughness of the sea and the badness of the

image is the only congruence hitherto observed.

     M. d'Abbadie's observations on the efiFect of the tides will be referred

to in the Appendix to this Report. He then discusses the various causes
which may perhaps influence the vertical.

The variations of air-temperature are insufficient, because the vertical

has been seen to vary 2"*4 in six hours. If the effects are to be attri-

buted to variations in the temperature of the rock, it would be necessary

to suppose that that temperature varies discontinuously, which it is

difficult to admit.

     If it be supposed that the changes take place in the instrument itself,

the like must be true of astronomical instruments. And there is no reason

to admit the reality of such strange variations.

Another cause, more convenient because more vague, is variation of a

chemical or mechanical nature in the crust of the earth. But if this be

so, why does the vertical ever return to its primitive position ? Another
cause may be variation in the position of the earth's axis of rotation.

The azimuthal variations in astronomical instruments, referred to

by M. d'Abbadie (see a paper by Mr. Henry, vol. 8, p. 134, ' Month. Not.

R.A.S. '), are difficult to explain without having recourse to such variation

in the axis of rotation.

He also tells us that Ellis (vol. 29, 1861, p. 45, ' Mem. R.A.S. ') has dis-

Acussed the Greenwich observations from 1851 to 1858.                                      comparison of

the results obtained from two neighbouring meridian instruments seemed

to show that the azimuthal variations are partly purely instrumental.
     M. d'Abbadie's paper contains diagrams illustrating the variations of

the vertical observed with the Nadirane during nearly two years. He

sums up the results as follows :
104 REroBT-- 1882.

    'En resume le maximum d'ecart da sud au nord entre le fil et son

image a ete egal a 49"'2 (this is 15"'94; it seems as though this should
be twice the deviation of the vertical) le 30 Novembre a 8h. 43m. du

matin. Ce meme jour, a 7h. 28m., on a la 40""1, chiffre porte ici au

tableau, et 87'^'6 seulement a Ih. 82m. da soir. Dans I'espace de six
heures la verticale a done varie de 2"'5 ou 0"'81 (as this is the deviation
of the image, should not the deviation of the vertical be half as much ?).
Le minimum de I'annee, ou 3'06, fut atteint le 19 Janvier a 3h. 3m. du

matin, ainsi que le 21 du meme mois a midi, bien qu'on eut observe 3"44 et

3'30 dans les matinees de ces deux jours, ainsi qu'on le voit au tableau

ci-apres .... Pendant I'annee entiere la verticale, consideree selon le

aura .... 8"'3 ou 2"' 7 pour la plus grande variation dans le sens Est-

Ouest ou Ton nivelle les tourillons des lunettes meridiennes.'
     Towards the end M. d'Abbadie makes the excellent remark, that in

discussing latitudes and declinations of stars, account should be taken of

the instantaneous position of the vertical at the moment of taking the

observation.

     In the 'Archives des Sciences,' 1881, vol. 5, p. 97, M. P. Planta-
mour continues the account of his observations on oscillations of the soil
at Secheron, near Geneva. The account of the earlier observations,
which we quoted from the ' Comptes Rendus ' in our previous Report, are
also contained in vol. 2 of the 'Archives,' p. 641. The paper to which
we are now referring contains a graphical reproduction of the previous

series of observations, as far as concerns the daily means.

The new series extends from October 1, 1879, to December 31, 1880,

the disposition of the levels being the same as was described in our last

Report. The observations were taken at 9 a.m. and G p.m., which hours

are respectively a little before the diurnal minimum and maximum. The

meaning of the terms maximum and minimum were somewhat obscure in

the ' Comptes Rendus,' but I now find that the right interpretation was

placed on M. Plantamour's words, for maximum means for the two

levels E. end highest and S. end highest.

The N.S. level seems to have behaved very similarly in the two years

of observation ; the total annual amplitudes in the two years being 4"'89

and 4"-56 respectively. In both years this level followed, with some

retardation, the curve of external temperature, except between April and

October, when the curves appear to be inverted. The E.W. level be-

haved very differently in the two years. In 1879 the E. end began to

fall rapidly at the end of November, and continued to fall until De-

--cember 26, when the reading was  88'''71                                it rose a little early in
                                                                       ;

January and then fell again, so that on January 28, 1880, the reading

-was 89"'95. The amplitude of the total fall (viz. from October 4, 1879,

to January 28, 1880) was 95"'80. In the preceding year the amplitude

was only 28"'08. The E. end has never recovered its primitive position,

and remains nearly 80'' below its point of departure.
     It is difficult to believe that so enormous a variation of level is

normal, and one is tempted to suspect that there is some systematic error
in his mode of observation. If such oscillations as these were to take

place in an astronomical observatory, accurate astronomical observations

would be almost impossible.
     I have seen nothing which shows that M. Plantamour takes any

special precaution with regard to the weight of the observer's body, nor

is it expressly stated that the observer always stands in exactly the same

position, although, of course, it is probable that this is the case. It would

be interesting, also, to learn whether any precautions have been taken for

equalising the temperature of the level itself. To hold the hand in the

neighbourhood of a delicate level is sufficient to quite alter the reading.

In one of his letters to me M. d'Abbadie also remarks on the slow

molecular changes in glass, which render levels untrustworthy for com-

parisons at considerable intervals of time. Although we must admire

M. Plantamour's indomitable perseverance, it is to be regretted that his

mode of observation is  by means of levels                                                                               and we are compelled to  regard,
                                                                                                                      ;

at least provisionally, these enormous changes of level either as a local

phenomenon, or as due to systematic error in his mode of observation.

In the Report for 1881 we referred to some observations by Admiral

AMouchez, made in 1856, on changes of level.                                                                             short paper by Admiral

Monchez on these observations will be found in the ' Comptes Rendus '

for 1878, vol. 87, p. 665. I now find that the observations were, in

fact, discussed by M. Gaillot, in a paper entitled ' Snr la direction de la

verticale a I'observatoire de Paris,' at p. 684 of the same volume. The

paper consists of the examination of 1,077 determinations of latitude, made

between 1856 and 1861, with the Gambey circle.

M. Gaillot concludes that the variation from year to year is acci-

dental, and that the variation of latitude iu the course of the year is

represented by

                =cX + 0"-20 sin p60░ (^ -_95)-|

where t is the number of days since January 1.

    By a comparison of day and night observations Le concludes that
there is no trace of a diurnal variation. On this we may remark that, if
the maximum and minimum occur at 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. (which is, roughly
speaking, what we found to be the case), then the diurnal oscillation

must necessarily disappear by this method of treatment.
     Individual observations ranged from 2"-48 above to 3'''17 below the

mean. On this he remarks :

     ' Ceux qui savent combien I'observation du nadir presente parfois de

diflBculte dans un observatoire situe au milieu d'une grande ville, ....

ceux-la ne trouveront pas ces ecarts exageres, et ne croiront nuUement avoir
besoinde faire intervenir une deviation de la verticale pour lesexpliquer.'

     M. Gaillot concludes by remarks adverse to any sensible deviations

of the vertical.

     It seems to me, however, that in the passage about the influence of
the traflBc of a great town, M. Gaillot begs the whole question by setting

down to that disturbing influence all remarkable deviations of the ver-
tical. Our observations, and those of many others, are entirely adverse

to such a conclusion.

     M. d'Abbadie, in a letter to me, also expresses himself as to the in-

conclusiveness of M. Gaillot's discussion.

    He also tells me that M. Tisserand, in his observations of latitude in

Japan, found variations amounting to nearly 7"; and when asked ' How he

could be so much in error,' answered ' That he was sure of his observa-

tions and calculations, but could not explain the cause of such variations.'

     On Variations in the Vertical due to Elasticity of the Earth's Surface.
                               By G. H. Darwin, F.R.S.

1. On the Mechanical Effects of Barometric Pressure on the Earth's Surface.

     The remarks of Signore de Rossi, on the observed connection between

barometric storms and the disturbance of the vertical, have led me to

make the following investigation of the mechanical effects which are
caused by variations of pressure acting on an elastic surface. The results
seem to show that the direct measurement of the lunar disturbance of
gravity must for ever remain impossible.

     The practical question is to estimate the amount of distortion to which
the upper strata of the earth's mass are subjected, when a wave of baro-
metric depression or elevation passes over the surface. The solution of
the following problem should give us such an estimate.

     Let an elastic solid be infinite in one direction, and be bounded in the
other direction by an infinite plane. Let the surface of the plane be every,
where acted on by normal pressures and tractions, which are expressible
as a simple harmonic function of distances measured in some fixed direc-
tion along the plane. It is required to find the form assumed by the
surface, and generally the condition of internal strain.

      This is clearly equivalent to the problem of finding the distortion of
the earth's surface produced by parallel undulations of barometric elevation
and depression. It is but a slight objection to the correctness of a rough
estimate of the kind required, that barometric disturbances do not actually

occur in parallel bands, but rather in circles. And when we consider the

magnitude of actual terrestrial storms, it is obvious that the curvature of

the earth's surface may be safely neglected.

     This problem is mathematically identical with that of finding the state
of stress produced in the earth by the weight of a series of parallel
mountains. The solution of this problem has recently been published in

a paper by me in the ' Philosophical Transactions ' (Part II. 1882, pp.
187-230), and the solution there found may be adapted to the present case

in a few lines.

     The problem only involves two dimensions. If the origin be taken in
the mean horizontal surface, which equally divides the mountains and
valleys, and if the axis of z be horizontal and perpendicular to the moun-
ON THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LUNAR DISTURBANCE OF GRAVITY. 107

tain chains, and if tlie axis of x be drawn vertically downwards, then the
equation to the mountains and valleys is supposed to be

                                  =x -- h cos
                                                                 6'

so that the wave-length from crest to crest of the mountain ranges is 27r&.

    The solution may easily be found from the analysis of section 7 of the

paper referred to. It is as follows :

     Let a, y be the displacements at the point x, z vertically downwards

and horizontally (a has here the opposite sign to the a of (44)). Let w be

the  density  of  the  rocks  of  which  the  mountains              are  composed                                         g gravity

Before proceeding further I shall prove a very remarkable relation

between the slope of the surface of an elastic horizontal plane and the

deflection of the plumb-line caused by the direct attraction of the weight

producing that slope. This relation was pointed out to me by Sir William

Thomson, when I told him of the investigation on which I was engaged
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

but I am alone responsible for the proof as here given. He writes that

he finds that it is not confined simply to the case where the solid is

incompressible, but in this paper it will only be proved for that case.

Let there be positive and negative matter distributed over the horizontal

plane according to the law wh cos {zjh) ; this forms, in fact, harmonic

Wemountains and valleys on the infinite plane.                 require to find the

potential and attraction of such a distribution of matter.

    Now the potential of an infinite straight line, of line-density p, at a

--point distant d from it, is well known to be 2/(p log d, where ji is the

attraction between unit masses at unit distance apart. Hence the potential

V of the supposed distribution of matter at the point x, z, is given by

           F = - -+2nivhr" cos ^ log s/ [x^ (4 2)2} di:

ratio is independent of the "wave-length 2Trh of the undulating surface, of
the position of the origin, and of the azimuth in the plane of the line

normal to the ridges and valleys. Therefore the proposition is true of any

combination whatever of harmonic undulations, and as any inequality may

be built up of harmonic undulations, it is generally true of inequalities of

any shape whatever.

   = = =Now a 6-37 x 10* cm., o 5Д; and ^ao 12-03 x 10* grammes

per square centimeter. The rigidity of glass in gravitation units ranges

from 1-5 X 10* to 2'4 X 10*. Therefore the slope of a very thick slab of

the rigidity of glass, due to a weight placed on its surface, ranges from

8 to 5 times as much as the deflection of the plumb-line due to the attraction
of that weight. Even with rigidity as great as steel (viz., about 8 x 10*),

the slope is 1^ times as great as the deflection.

   A practical conclusion from this is that in observations with an artificial

horizon the disturbance due to the weight of the observer's body is very

far greater than that due to the attraction of his mass. This is in perfect

accordance with the observations made by my brother and me with our

pendulum in 1881, when we concluded that the warping of the soil by our

weight when standing in the observing room was a very serious disturb-

ance, whilst we were unable to assert positively that the attraction of
weights placed near the pendulum was perceptible. It also gives emphasis

to the criticisms we have made on M. Plantamonr's observations

namely, that he does not appear to take special precautions against the

disturbance due to the weight of the observer's body.

   We must now consider the probable numerical values of the quantities

involved in the barometric problem, and the mode of transition from the

problem of the mountains to that of barometric inequalities.

The modulus of rigidity in gravitation units (say grammes weight per

square centimeter) is vjg. In the problem of the mountains, %vh is the mass

of a column of rock of one square centimeter in section and of length equal

to the heio-ht of the crests of the mountains above the mean horizontal

plane. In the barometric problem, ivh must be taken as the mass of a

column of mercury of a square centimeter in section and equal in height

to a half of the maximum range of the barometer.
    This maximum range is, I believe, nearly two inches, or, let us say,

5 cm.

   =The specific gravity of mercury is 136, and therefore wh 34 grammes.

The rigidity of glass is from 150 to 240 million grammes per square

that of copper 540, and of steel 843 millions.

are assumed to be more rigid than the most rigid glass. It will be easy

to adjust the results afterwards to any other assumed rigidity.

   We thus see that the ground is 9 cm, higher under the barometric

depression than under the elevation.
     If the sea had time to attain its equilibrium slope, it would stand

5 X Id 6, or 68 cm. lower under the high pressure than under the low.
But as the land is itself depressed 9 cm., the sea would apparently only
be depressed 59 cm. under the high barometer.

     It is probable that, in reality, the larger barometric inequalities do not
linger quite long enough over particular areas to permit the sea to attain
everywhere its due slope, and therefore the full difference of water-level

can only be attained occasionally.

    On the other hand, the elastic compression of the ground must take

place without any sensible delay. Thus it seems probable that the elastic
compression of the ground must exercise a very sensible effect in modifying
the apparent depression or elevation of the sea under high and low baro-

meter.

     It does not appear absolutely chimerical that, at some future time
when both tidal and barometric observations have attained to great
accuracy, an estimate might thus be made of the average modulus of
rigidity of the upper 500 miles of the earth's mass.

     Even in the present condition of barometric and tidal information, it
might be interesting to make a comparison between the computed height
of tide and the observed height, in connection with the distribution of
barometric pressure. It is probable that India would be the best field
for such an attempt, because the knowledge of Indian tides is more com-

plete than that for any other part of the world. On the other hand we

shall see in the following section that tidal observations on coast-lines of
continents are liable to disturbance, so that an oceanic island would be a

more favourable site.

    It has already been shown that the maximum apparent deflection of

the plumb-line, consequent on the elastic compression of the earth,

amounts to 0""0117, and this is augmented to 0"*0146 when we include

the true deflection due to the attraction of the air. It is worthy of remark
that this result is independent of the wave-length of the barometric
inequality, and thus we get rid of one of the conjectural data.

     Thus if we consider the two cases of high pressure to right and low
to left, and of low pressure to right and high to left, we see that there

will be a difference in the position of the plumb-line relatively to the

earth's surface of 0"'0292. Even if the rigidity of the upper strata of
the earth were as great as that of steel, there would still be a change of

0"-011.

   A deflection of magnitude such as 0""03 or 0"*01 would have been

easily observable with our instrument of last year, for we concluded
that a change of o^ro^h of a second could be detected, when the change

occurred rapidly.

     It was stated in our previous Report that at Cambridge the calculated
amplitude of oscillation of the plumb-line due directly to lunar disturbance

of gravity amounts to 0"*0216. Now as this is less than the amplitude

due jointly to elastic compression and attraction, with the assumed rigidity
(300 millions) of the earth's strata, and only twice the result if the
rigidity be as great as that of steel, it follows almost certainly that from
this cause alone the measurement of the lunar disturbance of gravity
must be impossible with any instrument on the earth's surface.

     Moreover the removal of the instrument to the bottom of the deepest

known mine wonld scarcely sensibly affect the result, because the flexure

of the strata at a depth so small, compared with the wave-length of
barometric inequalities, is scarcely different from the flexure of the

surface.

     The diurnal and periodic oscillations of the vertical observed by us
were many times as great as those which have just been computed, and
therefore it must not be supposed that more than a fraction, say perhaps
a tenth, of those oscillations was due to elastic compression of the earth.

     The Italian observers could scarcely, with their instruments, detect
deflections amounting to T-Joth of a second, so that the observed connec-
tion between barometric oscillation and seismic disturbance must be of a

different kind.
      It is not surprising that in a volcanic region the equalisation of pres-

sure, between imprisoned fluids and the external atmosphere, should lead

to earthquakes.

     If there is any place on the earth's surface free from seismic forces,
it might be possible (if the effect of tides as computed in the following
section conld be eliminated) with some such instrument as ours, placed

in a deep mine, to detect the existence of barometric disturbance many

hundreds of miles away. It would of course for this purpose be necessary

to note the positions of the sun and moon at the times of observation, and

to allow for their attraction.

2. On the Disturbance of the Vertical near the Coasts of Continents due

                             to the Rise and Fall of the Tide.

Consider the following problem :

On an infinite horizontal plane, which bounds in one direction an

infinite incompressible elastic solid, let there be drawn a series of parallel

straight lines, distant I apart. Let one of these be axis of y, let the axis

of z be drawn in the plane perpendicular to the parallel lines, and let the

axis of x, be drawn vertically downwards through the solid.
=At every point of the surface of the solid, from 2;
                                                      to Z, let a normal
-- = --pressure gioh (1 2zjl) be applied ; and from 2
                                            to Z let the sur-

face be free from forces. Let the same distribution of force be repeated

over all the pairs of strips into which the surface is divided by the system

of parallel straight lines. It is required to determine the strains caused

by these forces.

Taking the average over the whole surface there is neither pressure

nor traction, since the total traction on the half-strips subject to traction

is equal to the total pressure on the half-strips subject to pressure.

     The following is the analogy of this system with that which we wish

to discuss : the strips subject to no pressure are the continents, the alter-

nate ones are the oceans, g is gravity, lo the density of water, and h the

height of tide above mean water on the coast-line.

    We require to find the slope of the surface at every point, and the

vertical displacement.

It is now necessary to bring this problem within the range of the

results used in the last section. In the first place, it is convenient to

consider the pressures and tractions as caused by mountains and valleys

     It is interesting to determine the form of surface denoted by these

    +When 9 is zero or tt, dujdB becomes infinite, which denotes that

the tangent to the warped horizontal surface is vertical at these points.

The verticality of these tangents will have no place in reality, because

actual shores shelve, and there is not a vertical wall of water when the

Wetide rises, as is supposed to be the ca,sein the ideal problem.     shall, how-

ever, see that in practical numerical application, the strip of sea-shore along

which the solution shows a slope of more than 1" is only a small fraction

of a millimeter. Thus this departure from reality is of no importance

whatever.

enormous exaggeration of the flexure actually possibly due to tides.

     It is interesting to note that the land regions remain very nearly flat,

rotating about the nodal line, but with slight curvature near the coasts.

It is this curvature, scarcely perceptible in the figure, which is of most

interest for practical application.

     The series (8) and (9) are not convenient for practical calculation in
the neighbourhood of the coast, and they must be reduced to other forms.

It is easy, by writing the cosines in their exponential form, to show that

+ + + = -cos                                           (▒log^

Where the upper sign in (13) is to be taken for positive values of and

the lower for negative.

     For the small values of 0, for which alone we are at present con-

--cerned, the series (13) becomes logg (-+; 0) and the lower loge 2.

    Taking half the diiference and half the sum of the two series we have

     I shall now proceed to compute from the formulae (21) the depression

of the surface and the slope, corresponding to such numerical data as
seem most appropriate to the terrestrial oceans and continents.

      Considering that the tides are undoubtedly augmented by kinetic

action, we shall be within the mai'k in taking h as the semi-range of
equilibrium tide. At the equator the lunar tide has a range of about

53 cm., and the solar tide is very nearly half as much. Therefore at

=spring-tides we may take h 40 cm. It must be noticed that the high-

ness of the tides, say 15 or 20 feet, near the coast is due to the shallow-
ing of the water, and it would not be just to take such values as repre-
senting the tides over large areas ; iv, the density of the water is, of

course, unity.

     If we suppose it is the Atlantic Ocean and the shores of Europe with
Africa, and of North and South America, which are under consideration, it
is not unreasonable to take I as 3,900 miles or 6'28 x 10^ cm. Then
'lirzjl =2X10-8.

    Taking v jg as3x 10^, that is to say, assuming a rigidity greater than
that of glass, we have for the slope in seconds of arc, at a distance z from

the sea-shore

    On considering the formula (22) it appears that z must be a very small

fraction of a millimeter before the slope becomes even as great as 1'.
This proves that the rounded nick in the surface, which arises from the

discontinuity of pressure at our ideal mean water-mark, is excessively

small, and the vertical displacement of the surface is sensibly the same,

when measured in centimeters, on each side of the nick, in accordance

with the first of (21).

     The result (5) of section 1 shows that, Avith rigidity 3 x 10*, the true
deflection cf plumb-line dne to attraction of the water is a quai'ter of the
slope. Hence an observer in a gravitational observatory at distance z

portion as the sea is narrowed. If, for example, the sea were 3,142 kilo-
meters wide, then at 10 kilometers from the coast the apparent amplitude
of deflection is 0"-042. If the range of tide is greater than that here
assumed (viz., 80 cm.), the results must be augmented in the same
proportion. And, lastly, if the rigidity of the rock be greater or less than
the assumed value (viz., 3 X 10**) the part of the apparent deflection
depending on slope must be diminished or increased in the inverse pro-

portion to the change in rigidity.
     I think there can be little doubt that in narrow seas the tides are

generally much greater than those here assumed ; and it is probable that

at a gravitational observatory actually on the sea-shore on the south-coast
of England, apart from seismic changes, perceptible oscillations of the

vertical would be noted.
     Sir William Thomson has made an entirely independent estimate of

the probable deflection of the plumb-line at a seaside gravitational obser-

vatory.^ He estimates the attraction of a slab of water, 10 feet thick

(the range of tide), 50 miles broad perpendicular to the coast, and 100
miles long parallel with coast, on a plummet 100 yards from the low-

water mark, and opposite the middle of the 100 miles of length. He

thinks this estimate would very roughly represent the state of things say

at St. Alban's Head. He finds then that the deflection of the plumb-line

as high tide changes to low would be ^^jro^ooth of the unit angle, or
0"*050. The general theorem proved above, as to the proportionality of
slope to attraction, shows that, with rigidity 3 x 10" for the rocks of
which the earth is formed, the apparent deflection of the plumb-line would
amount to 0"-25.

     It is just possible that a way may in this manner be opened for deter-

mining the modulus of rigidity of the upper 100 or 200 miles of the earth's
surface, although the process would be excessively laborious. The tides of
the British Channel are pretty well known, and therefore it would be
possible by very laborious quadratures to determine the deflection of the
plumb-line due to the attraction of the tide at any time at a chosen station.

If then the deflection of the plumb-line could be observed at that station

(with corrections applied for the positions of the sun aud moon), the

ratio of the calculated to the observed and corrected deflection, together

with the known value of the earth's radius and mean density, form

the materials for computing the rigidity. But such a scheme would

be probably rendered abortive by just such comparatively large and

capricious oscillations of the vertical, as we, M. d'Abbadie and others,

have observed.

It is interesting to draw attention to some observations of M.

d'Abbadie on the deflections of the vertical due to tides. His observatory

(of which an account was given in the Report for 1881) is near Hendaye

in the Pyrenees, and stands 72 meters above, and 400 meters distant, from

Hethe sea.  writes : '

patience de comparer ainsi 71 flots et 73 jusants consecutifs, de Janvier a

theories admises. On est done en droit d'afiirmer que si la mer haute

attire le plus souvent le pied du fil a plomb, il y a une, et peut-etre

plusieurs, autres forces en jeu pour faire varier sa position.'

observed on the coasts of narrow seas must probably produce vertical

oscillations of quite the same order as that computed.

If the land falls the tide of course rises higher on the coast line than

it would do otherwise

slope from mid-ocean to the sea-coasfc. The figure shows that this is uot
rigorously the case, but it is quite near enough for a rough approximation.
The phenomena of the short period tides are so essentially kinetic that
the value of this augmentation must remain quite uncertain, but for
the long-period tides (the fortnightly and monthly elliptic) the augmen-
tation must correspond approximately with the ratio

                          1 : fl-^J^ X 2-1037. ^

The augmentation in narrow seas will be small, but in the Atlantic Ocean
the augmenting factor must agree pretty well with that which I now

compute.'

     With the previous numerical values we have og/Zi (which is inde-

-- = =pendent of h) equal to '1421, and 1 uqIJi '8579 i very nearly.

     Thus the long-period tides may px'obalDly undergo an augmentation at

the coasts of the Atlantic in some such ratio as 6 to 7.
     The influence of this kind of elastic yieldiilg is antagonistic to that

reduction of apparent tide, which must result from an elastic yielding of
the earth's mass as a whole.

     The reader will probably find it difEculfc to estimate what degree of

jn'obability of correctness there is in the conjectural value of the rigidity,

which has been used in making the numerical calculations in this paper.

The rigidity has not been experimentally determined for many substances,
but a great number of experiments have been made to find Young's
modulus. Now, in the stretching of a bar or wire the comj^ressibility
plays a much less important part than the rigidity, and the formula for

Young's modulus shows that for an incompressible elastic solid the
modulus is equal to three times the rigidity.^ Hence a third of Young's
modulus will form a good standard of comparison with the assumed
rigidity, namely, 3 X 10** grammes weight per square centimeter. The
following are a few values of a third of Young's modulus and of rigidity,
taken from the tables in Sir William Thomson's article on Elasticity'' in

the ' Encyclopa3dia Britannica.'

     It will be observed that the assumed rigidity 3 is probably a pretty

high estimate in comparison with that of the materials of which we know

the superficial strata to be formed.

      It is shown, in another paper read before the Association at this
meeting, that the rigidity of the earth as a whole is probably as great as
that of steel. That result is not at all inconsistent with the probability
of the assumption that the upper strata have only a rigidity a little greater
than that of glass.

  ON THE MEASUKEMENT OF THE LUNAR DISTURBANCE OF GRAVITY. 119

                            3. On Gravitational Observatories.

     In the preceding sections estimates have been made of the amount

of distortion -which the upper strata of the earth probably undergo,
from the shifting weights corresponding to barometric and tidal oscil-

lations. These results appear to me to have an important bearing on the

probable utility of gravitational observatories.

     It is not probable, at least for many years to come, that the state of

tidal and barometric pressure, for a radius of 500 miles round any spot

on the earth's surface, will be known with sufficient accuracy to make

even a rough approximation to the slope of the surface a possibility.

And were these data known, the heterogeneity of geological strata would

form a serious obstacle to the possibility of carrying out such a computa-
tion. It would do little in relieving us from these difficulties to place the
observatory at the bottom of a mine.

      Accordingly the prospect of determining experimentally the lunar

disturbance of gravity appears exceedingly remote, and I am compelled

reluctantly to conclude that continuous observations with gravitational
instruments of very great delicacy are not likely to lead to results of any
great interest. It appears likely that such an instrument, even in the
most favourable site, would record incessant variations of which no satis-
factory account could be given. Although I do not regard it as probable
that such a delicate instrument should be adopted for regular continuous
observations, yet, by choosing a site where the flexure of the earth's
surface is likely to be great, it is conceivable that a rough estimate might

be made of the average modulus of elasticity of the upper strata of the
earth for one or two hundred miles from the surface.

    These conclusions, which I express with much diffidence, are by no
means adverse to the utility of a coarser gravitational instrument, capable,

let us say, of recording variations of level amounting to 1" or 2". If
barometric pi-essure, tidal pressure, and the direct action of the sun and
moon, combined together to make apparent slope in one direction, then
at an observatory remote from the sea-shore, that slope might perhaps
amount to a quarter of a second of arc. Such a disturbance of level

would not be important compared with the minimum deviations which

could be recorded by the supposed instrument.

     It would then be of much value to obtain continuous systematic
observations, after the manner of the Italians, of the seismic and slower

quasi-seismic variations of level.

     I venture to predict that at some future time practical astronomers
will no longer be content to eliminate variations of level merely by taking
means of results, but will regard corrections derived from a special in-
strument as necessary to each astronomical observation.

Report of the Covimittee, consisting of Professor Dewar, Dr.
   Williamson, Dr. Marshall Watts, Captain Abney, Mr. Stoney,
   Professor Hartley, Professor McLeod, Professor Carey Foster,
   Professor A. K. Huntington, Professor Emerson Reynolds, Pro-

   fessor Reinold, Professor Liveing, Lord Eayleigh, Dr. Schuster,

   and Professor W. Chandler Roberts {Secretary), appointed for
   the purpose of reporting tipon the present state of out Know-

   ledge of Spectrum Analysis.

The Genesis of Spectra. By Dr. Schuster.

It is the ambitious object of Spectroscopy to study the vibrations of

atoms and molecules in order to obtain what information we can on the

nature of the forces which bind them together. The vibrations we know

must be of a very complicated nature, yet it is natural that not many

years after Spectrum Analysis was raised to the rank of a science by the

labours of Kirchhoff and Bunsen attempts were made to discover a law

in the apparent irregularity with which different lines of the same element

are distributed over the spectrum. If an atom can vibrate in more ways

than one, it is certain that some connection must exist between the

different periods, and this connection we may attempt to find out by trial.

Or we may speculate on the causes which produce such vast differences

in the chemical properties of some of the elements, while other elements

have properties which resemble each other to an equally marked degree.

We may be led on by such speculations to try whether we can trace any

similarity in the periods of vibration of molecules which have similar

chemical properties, or we may endeavour to classify the elements accord-

ing to their spectra, and see whether such a classification would divide

the elements into groups agreeing with those into which they have been

divided by means of their chemical and physical behaviour.

When different elements combine together the vibrations of the com-

pound molecule are not obtained by the simple addition of the periods of

the elements. The spectrum of a molecule is entirely distinct from that of

its elements, and we may well ask the question whether we can trace in

the spectrum of the compound the influence of the different atoms com-

posing it. Thus, for instance, we might trace some relationship between

the spectra of the oxides, bromides, chlorides, or iodides of a metal and

that of the metal itself, or we may in the absorption spectrum of a salt

trace one part to the influence of the base, the other to the influence of

the acid. Such and similar questions have been raised and have been

partially answered. But we must not too soon expect the discovery of

any grand and very general law, for the constitution of what we call

a molecule is no doubt a very complicated one, and the difficulty of the

problem is so great that were it not for the primary importance of the

result which we may finally hope to obtain, all but the most sanguine

might well be discouraged to engage in an inquiry which, even after many

Weyears of work, may turn out to have been fruitless.       know a great

deal more about the forces which produce the vibrations of sound than

about those which produce the vibrations of light. To find out the

different tunes sent out by a vibrating system is a problem which may or

may not be solvable in certain special cases, but it would baffle the most

skilful mathematician to solve the inverse problem and to find out the
shape of a bell by means of the sounds which it is capable of sending

out. And this is the problem -which ultimately spectroscopy hopes to

solve in the case of light. In the meantime we must welcome with delight

even the smallest step in the desired direction.

      It is the object of the present report to bring together the various

attempts which have been made to trace a connection either between the
vibrations of the same body, between those of different compounds of the
same body, or finally between the vibrations of similarly constituted bodies.

I. Comiection hetiveen the different periods of Vibration of one Molecide.

In some acoustical systems the difiTerent periods of vibration are con-

nected together by means of a very simple law, and it was a natural idea

to trace the same law if possible in the luminous vibrations of molecules.

If the law holds good the periods of vibrations or the lengths of the

waves of light sent out by molecules ought to be in the ratio of small

integer numbers. The first published attempt to trace such a connec-
tion is due to Lecoq de Boisbaudran, who investigated the spectrum of

nitrogen' with special reference to this point. The spectrum in question,
which is the one appearing at low temperatures, is made up of two sets of

bands, one reaching fi'om the red into the green, and one reaching from

the green into the violet. Lecoq de Boisbaudran tried to show that

each band of the second set had a wave-length which was in the ratio of

three to four, with a corresponding band of the first set. The author

had, however, only a one prism spectroscope at his disposal, and the wave-

lengths as determined by him could not possibly possess that accuracy
which is necessary for an investigation of this nature. The more accurate
measurements of Thalen do not bear oat Lecoq's result. Thus, for

instance, two bands, 5064 and 6752, according to Lecoq, are nearly in the

required ratio                                                                             if  the  agreement  was  perfect  the latter number ought to
                                                                                        ;

be 6748                                        but  Thalen,                                         though giving to the green band a number agreeing
                                            ;

fairly well with Lecoq's, puts the red band at 6786, differing very con-

siderably from 6754, the required value, if Thalen's measurement for

the green band is used. The other coincidences pointed out by Lecoq

are similarly disproved by more exact measurements. Inquiries such as

those attempted by Lecoq can only be conducted with advantage when
we have measured to the highest degree of accuracy which we can
obtain in our best instruments, and many of the apparent harmonic ratios
which at one time were thought to hold good had to give way when sub-

jected to a severer test. Mr. Johnstone Stoney,^ realising this fact,

has, however, pointed out one set of harmonic ratios which seems to hold

Wegood to a high degree of accuracy.                                                                                know of folir hydrogen lines in

the visible part of the spectrum, and three of these are found to be in the

ratios of 20 ; 27 : 32. The wave-lengths of these lines are amongst

those best determined by Angstrom, and they were corrected by Mr.

Stoney for atmospheric refraction. The following table exhibits the very

remarkable coincidence.

A few years ago Dr. Hnggins succeeded in obtaining photographs of

ten ultra-violet lines observed in the spectra of stars, which in the visible

part give chiefly the hydrogen lines. These ultra-violet lines are most

likely all due to hydrogen, and we know that this is the case with the

four least refrangible ones. Mr. Johnstone Stoney has pointed out

several harmonic ratios connecting them together ; the hydrogen line Hy

near G, for instance, has a wave-length which is very nearly in the ratio

of 35 : 32 with the one which is nearly coincident with the solar line H.'

Mr. Johnstone Stoney ^ has also examined the absorption spectrum of

chlorochromic anhydride. The bands of that spectrum seem to be dis-

tributed with remarkable regularity. Mr. Stoney considers them to be

all harmonics of one fundamental vibration. The measurements do not,

however, seem to possess that degree of accuracy which is desirable, and

Wecan be obtained by our present methods.  must, therefore, suspend

our judgment for the present on the reality of the coincidences pointed

out by Mr. Stoney. Other writers, as, for instance, Soret,^ have fi'om

time to time drawn attention to harmonic ratios in various spectra, and

the author of this report'' has during the last ten years collected a lai-ge

quantity of material bearing on the question. The results have, on the

whole, not been favoui-able to the theoiy of harmonic ratios. In an}^

spectrum containing a large number of lines it is clear that, owing to

accidental coincidences, we shall always be able to find ratios which agree

very closely with the ratios of small integer numbers. It is only by

means of a systematic investigation that we can find out whether these

Wecoincidences are due to any real cause.  must, by means of the theorj-

of probability, calculate the number of the coincidences which we might

expect to find on the supposition that the lines are distributed at random

throughout the whole range of the visible spectrum. If on calculating

out all fi-actions which can be formed in a spectrum by any pair of lines

the number of ratios agreeing within certain limits with ratios of integer

number greatly exceeds the most probable number, we should have reason

to suppose that the lines are not distributed at random, but that the law

suggested by Messrs. Lecoq de Boisbaudran and Stoney is a true one.

The following two tables exhibit the results of an investigation which has

been conducted on these lines.

                                Table II.

ON OUR KNOAVLEDGE OF SFECTEUM ANALYSIS.  123

      For the full explanation of Table II. we must refer to tbe paper
 which has already been quoted. The second column gives the number
 of fractions investigated for each element. The third column gives a
 number which ought to be nearly '25 (probably within the limits of the
 values of the fourth column), if the lines are distributed at random aud

 decidedly smaller than this niimber if the law of harmonic ratios is true.

       It will be seen that three out of the five elements considered,

including the two containing the greatest number of lines, give a mean
value greater than '25, and that in the two remaining cases the number,
though smaller than '25, falls within the limits into which we must

expect it to fall, on the supposition of a distribution at random.
Table III. shows the results of a more detailed examination of the iron

spectrum, over 10,000 fractions having been calculated and compared with
ratios of integers smaller than 100. In order to calculate the number of
coincidences which we might expect on the theory of probability, the

limits had to be fixed within which we may consider a coincidence to

have taken place. These limits must of course depend on the accuracy

which we assign to the measurements of the lines. The results were

▒ ▒worked out for two different limits, which were '0000505 and -0000755.

When, therefore, two lines had j^eriods the ratio of which fell within the
indicated limits of some ratio of two integer numbers smaller than 100,
this was called a coincidence. In Table III. the columns headed ' Observed '
and ' Calculated ' give the number of these coincidences as actually found,
and as calculated from the theory of probability. In the first row all
fractions were taken into account the denominator of which is smaller
than 10 ; in the second row the denominator is between 10 and 20, and so

on for the other rows.

be left out of account. For the full discussion of it we refer to the
original paper, and only quote, in conclusion, the summary of results

obtained :
     1. There is a real cause acting in a direction opposed to the law of

harmonic ratios, so far as fractions formed by numbers smaller than 70

are concerned.

2. After elimination of the first cause a tendency appears for fractions

formed by two lines to cluster round liarmonic ratios.

3. Most probably some law hitherto undiscovered exists which in

special cases resolves itself into the law of harmonic ratios.

It must be remarked, however, that these conclusions must stand at

present on the evidence of the iron spectrum alone, and it is not im-

possible that the regularities which have been discovered are due to

Weaccident.     can at present only say that the investigation, as far as it

has gone, seems to point to the above conclusions.
     There is one fact which points very strongly to another yet un-

discovered law which rules over the distribution of lines in spectra. It is

often observed that the spectrum of some body contains two or three

lines in close proximity, forming a characteristic group. Such doublets

or triplets are often repeated several times  in the  spectrum                                       yet, though
                                                                                                  ;

we might expect, if the harmonic law was true, to find some simple rela-

tions connecting the periods of these sets, such is not the case. The lines

of sodium, for instance, are all double. In the set of lines given by

Thalen the components approach each other as we pass to the more

refrangible end of the spectrum more rapidly than they would if the

lines were connected by the harmonic law. In the following table the
wave-length of the least refrangible of each set of sodium lines is given,

together with the distance of the two components. In addition to the
pairs observed by Thalen, one pair in the ultra-red, photographed by
Abney, and one pair in the ultra-violet, photographed by Cornu, ai-e

shows that the resemblance is only a general one, and that the relative
distances vary considerably in each set.

several times come nearer and nearer together towards the ultra-violet,
while at the same time the members of each group also approach, is very
suo-crestive, and promises to furnish a safer basis for future research than
the hypothesis of harmonic ratios. As another example illustrating the

same fact, we may mention the absorption spectrum of iodine, where the

distance of fluted bands of each set decreases with the wave-length.

     There is one more fact which ought to be mentioned. The fluted
bands in spectra are often at fairly equal intervals from each other,
but a curious change and transformation seems sometimes to occur.
Fig. 1 is not intended to represent any particular spectrum, but simply
to represent this transformation ; to the left a series of bauds are seen
which have been denoted by I,, lo, &c. ; but to the right of I4 springs
up another faint band, II,, which, being repeated, gradually gains in
intensity until finally, by the side of Ilg, the band of the first series is no

longer visible.

   A third series of bands, III,, III2, &c., springs up again to the

right of the second series, and in its turn overpowers it in intensity.

Those who are familiar with fluted band specti'a will easily call back to
their minds the single bands like I,, the bands with weak companion
like I4, or the double and treble bands like I7 or I9. Thalen has

                                                                       Fig. 1.

                                                                   2

pointed out how the absorption spectrum of iodine is composed of several
such overlapping spectra. The bands in this case shade off" towards the

red, and the additional bands always spring up towards the violet.

The bands approach each other very rapidly as they approach the violet
end. The diffei-ences between corresponding bands of the second series
are always smaller than between those of the first series, so that the
distance between two adjacent bands of the first and second series be-
comes larger towards the red ; the same holds good for the other series.
Mr. Lockyer has noticed in his jjhotographs of the spectrum, which appears
in the electric arc and seems to be due to nitrocarbon, that the least re-
frangible of the ultra-violet bands does not seem to correspond with the
least refrangible, but with the second band of the violet series, so that here,
apparently, a similar change has taken place, an additional band having
sprunf up in the least refi'angible side. It is much to be desired that

such changes should be carefully examined in each case, as they may

lead to most valuable results.
WeThe tendency to form fiutings is very remarkable.
                                                     have first the wide

fluting formed by the hydrogen lines ; we have next the narrow flutings

of band spectra, and this again, as in the case of iodine gas, approaching

--each other indefinitely as they go towards the violet, seems to form a

fluting of the second order a fluting of flutings. In the overlapping

bauds of different series we may even recognise perhaps flutings of the

third order.

II. Belation of the Spectrum of an Element to tJiat of its Compounds.

     There is perhaps no other inrestigation connected with molecular
vibrations which is of greater intei-est than that which tries to trace the
connection between the spectrum of an element and that of its compounds.

It was at first considered, as has already been mentioned, that an element

preserved its spectrum when entering into combination, so that, for

instance, the oxide of a metal would only show the metallic lines except in
so far as oxygen lines might be visible. This idea had to be given up, but

the absorption spectra of fluids were considered at first to be evidence in
favour of the assumption of permanence of the spectrum of an element
when combined with others. AV"e owe the first systematic investio-ation

on this point to Dr. Gladstone,' who examined the absorption spectra of

the solution of salts, each constituent of which was coloured. He came

to the conclusion that, generally, but not invariably, the following law
                                                   ' When
held  good                                                 an                                                          acid  and  a  base  combine,  each     of which  has  a
                                      :

difierent influence on the rays of light, a solution of the resultino- salt

will transmit only those rays which are not absorbed by either, or in

other words, which are transmitted by both.'

     Thus, for instance, chromic acid in solution cuts off the more re-

frangible half of the spectrum, admitting only the blue rays near F in

thin  solutions                                    but     they                                                        transmit      the   less  refrangible  half  perfectly.
                                                ;

This characteristic absorption of chromic acid remains when the acid

is combined with such bodies as copper, nickel, ferric oxide, uranium,

potash,  and                                       chromium                                                            but   the  salts  formed  by  combination    with the
                                                                                                                    ;

three first-mentioned bodies show also their own influence when combined

with chromic or other acids by cutting off, as in copper and nickel, part

of the red end of the spectrum, or extending, as in ferric oxide, the' blue

absorption into the green. The characteristic absorption bands of uranium

salts are in the blue. As the chromic acid cuts off the blue, chromate of

uranium will not show the bands, but only a general absorption in their

stead. The potassium salts are colourless when combined with colourless

acids, and chromate of potash shows therefore the same spectrum as

chromic acid. Chromate of chromium forms an exception to the rule

for though the absorption peculiar to chromic acid exists, the absorption

visible in ordinary chromium salts does not appear. Soret^ has confirmed

Dr. Gladstone's conclusions with regard to the identity of the absorption

spectraof different chromates. The chromates of sodium, potassium, and

ammonia, as well as the bichromates of potassium and ammonia, were

found to give the same absorption spectrum. Kor is the effect of these

chromates confined to the blocking out simply of one end of the spectrum,

as in the visible part, but two distinct absorption bands are seen, which

seem unchanged in position if one of the above-mentioned chromates is re-

placed by another. These absorption bands show themselves only in weak

solutions                                          the centre of one has a wave-length of about 3610 10"'" metres,
                                                ;

while the other is wider, and reaches from 2950 to 2440 approximately in

solutions containing about 0-1 grammes to the litre. From 2220 onwards

the spectrum is completely blocked out. Chromic acid itself showed the

bands, but less distinctly, and Soret does not consider the purity of the acid

sufficiently proved to allow him to draw any certain conclusions from this

observation.

     Erhard' bas examined the absorption spectra of some salts in which

chromium plays the part of a base. It may be said as a general rule that

these salts absorb the yellow and yellowish-greeu and also the violet end

of the spectrum, transmitting the blue ; the exact position of the maxi-

mum of absorption, however, and the intensity of the absorption band,

varies considerably with different salts, and even for the same salt with

different temperatures, and the results are complicated by the fact that
heating the salts produces a permanent alteration in the absorption. The
insoluble chloride of chromium shows a behaviour differing from that of
the other chromium salts. It transmits the yellow and more of the violet

than the other salts. Some of the solid crystals of various chromium

salts show fine absorption bands in the red which can also be traced in

some of the solutions. There is therefore a general resemblance in the
absorption of different chromium salts, but no identity.

Dr. Gladstone has also examined the eifect of chlorine, bromine,

and iodine when combined with different metals. The bromides of gold,

platinum, palladium, and potassium give a spectrum which is identical

with that of bromine water ; the same applies to a concentrated solution

of the bromide of copper, which in addition shows the red absorption

Acharacteristic of copper.         dilute solution of bromide of copper shows,

however, no absorption which can be traced to the bromine. Similar

results were obtained with the chlorides and iodides. In pointing out
that it is generally though not universally true that a base or an acid

retains its absorptive properties in different combinations, Dr. Gladstone

draws attention to the remarkable exception of ferric ferrocyanide, which

when dissolved in oxalic acid transmits blue rays in great abundance,

though the same rays are generally absorbed both by ferrocyanides and

by ferric salts.

Nitric acid and the nitrates of transparent bases such as potassium,

sodium, and ammonia show spectra, according to Soret, which are not

only qualitatively but also quantitatively identical ; that is to say, a

given quantity of nitric acid in solution gives a characteristic absorption
band of exactly the same width and darkness whether by itself alone
or combined with a transparent base. It also shows a continuous absorp-
tion at the most refrangible side, beginning with each of the mentioned
salts at exactly the same point. The ethereal nitrates,^ however, give

different results.

     Messrs. Hartley and Huntington have by photographic methods
examined the absorption spectra of a great number of organic compounds.

As their researches have already been referred to at length in these
reports,' by one of the authors, we need at present only mention one or

two of the results which most interest us from our present point of view.

The normal alcohols were found to be transparent for the ultra-violet
rays, the normal fatty acids less so. In both cases an increased number

of carbon atoms increases the absorption at the most refrangible end.
The fact that benzene and its derivatives are remarkable for their power-
ful absorption of the most refrangible rays, and for characteristic ab-
sorption bands appearing on dilution, led Professor Hartley to a more
extended examination of some of the more complicated organic substances.

He came to the conclusion that definite absorption bands are only pro-

duced by substances in -which three pairs of carbon atoms are doubly

linked together, as in the benzine ring.

In most of the cases which we have hitherto discussed, the charac-

teristic absorption of the substance under examination extended over a

considerable range                                                                                     the  substance either  blocked   out altogether  a  large

part of the spectrum, or at least showed absorption bands which were

broad and increased considerably in width with increased concentration.

When, however, absorption bands become narrower and more definite,

so that they can be examined under high dispersive powers, their

behaviour under different circumstances becomes more interesting, for we
can trace smaller differences and more minute changes.

     It was Bunsen ^ who first showed that such small changes do occur,
and he thereby led the way in a line of research which promises to be of

great importance. While examining the absorption spectra of different
didymium salts, he found that though all the salts showed spectra so
nearly identical that with the ordinary one prism spectroscope they could

easily be mistaken for each other, higher dispersive powers revealed some

--very interesting and characteristic changes. His conclusions are best

quoted in his own words :

     ' Very remarkable and noteworthy are the small alterations in position
which occur in the minima of brightness in the didymium spectrum,
dependent upon the nature of the compound in which the metal occurs.
These changes are too minute to be seen with the small, though seen
with the large instrument. I have as yet only investigated them com-

pletely in the case of three didymium salts, viz., the chloride, sulphate,
and acetate. It is, however, more than probable that the same phe-
nomena will also be found to occur with other solutions, and with the

absorption spectra of other crystals of didymium salts, and perhaps may

be exhibited with the luminous spectra of the oxide and other compounds

of didymium                                                                                            The atomic weight of didymium chloride is 95-9,

and that of the anhydrous acetate is 106-9. It will be noticed that all

the groups of bands in the case of salts under examination approach

the red end of the spectrum in the order of their increasing atomic

weights.

      ' These differences here noticed in the absorption spectra of different
didymium compounds cannot in our present complete state of ignorance
of any general theory for the absorption of light in absorptive media be

connected with other phenomena. They remind one of the slight and
gradual alterations in pitch which the notes from a vibrating elastic rod
undergo when the rod is weighted, or of the change of tone which an
organ-pipe exhibits when the tube is lengthened.'

     The increased lowering of the vibrations with increasing atomic
weight of substance combined with the didymium is no doubt very sug-
gestive, but we cannot at present assign any definite law regulating the
displacement in different cases. Thus the difference in the wave-length
between the bands of the chloride and acetate is nearly the same for all

four bands, but the difference in the wave-length between the bands of
the chloride and acetate decreases rapidly with decreasing wave-length,

so that the yellow band is displaced about twice as much as the green
band, and about three times as much as the bands in the blue. It follows

from this difference in the behaviour that while the effect of the acetate
on the yellow band is about seven times as large as that of the sulphate,

Wethe effect is only about twice as large on the bine band.  must refer

to a note by Messrs. Lawrance Smith and Lecoq de Boisbaudran ' for a

description of the spectrum of the nitrate of didymium and its changes on

addition of nitric acid.

     Some interesting cases of this shifting of bands in different compounds
of the same body have been found by Professor Russell,^ who has sub-

jected the cobalt salts to a very careful and most instructive examina-
tion. The anhydrous bromide of cobalt, for instance, was found to give

an absorption spectrum strongly similar to that of the chloride, but there
is a general displacement of all the bauds towards the red corresponding
to the increased atomic weight of bromine. The effect on the most re-
frano-ible band is stronger tlian that on the other two bands, which is
contrary to what Bunsen has observed in the case of didymium acetate.

    Captain Abney and Lieutenant- Colonel Testing's paper* ' On the

Influence of the Atomic Grouping in the Molecules of Organic Bodies on

their Absorption in the Infra-red Region of the Spectrum,' contains an

account of investigations undertaken to throw light on the effect of
chemical combination on molecular vibrations. The importance of the

results which they have obtained will justify a few verbal quotations.
They distinguish a general absorption from the least refrangible end, and

special absorptions which may consist of lines or bands.
     ' Reo-ardino- the general absoi'ption we have nothing very noteworthy

to remar-k, beyond the fact that, as a rule, in the hydrocarbons of the
same series those of heavier molecular constitution seem to have less than

those of lighter.'

     This effect agrees with the observation made by Professors Hartley

and Huntington in the ultra-violet in so far as a general shifting of the
absorption towards the red seems to take place as the number of carbon

atoms is increased. Such a shifting would increase the general absorption
in the ultra-violet, as observed by Professors Hartley and Huntington,
and decrease it in the infra-red, as observed by Captain Abney and Colonel
Festino-. Turning their attention next to the sharply defined lines, our
author's, by means of a series of systematic experiments, come to the

conclusion that these must be due to the hydrogen atoms in the molecule.

    A' crucial test was to observe spectra containing hydrogen and

chlorine, hydrogen and oxygen, and hydrogen and nitrogen.

    We' therefore tried hydrochloric acid and obtained a spectrum con-

taining some few lines. Water gave lines, together with bands, two lines

 beino- coincident with those in the specti'um ot' hydrochloric acid.

     '"in ammonia, nitric acid, and sulphuric acid we also obtained sharply-
marked lines, coincidences in the different spectra being observed, and
nearly eveiy line mapped found its analogue in the chloroform spectrum,
and usually in that of ethyl iodide. Benzene again gave a spectrum
 consisting principally of lines, and these were coincident with some lines

 also to be found in chloroform. It seems then that the hydrogen, which

is common to all these different compounds, must be the cause of the
linear spectrum. In what manner the hydrogen annihilates the waves of

 radiation at these particular points is a question which is at present, at

all events, an open one, but that the linear absorptions, common to the

hydrocarbons and to those bodies in which hydrogen is in combination

witli other elements such as oxygen and nitrogen, is due to hydrogen,
there can be no manner of doubt.'

' The next point that required solution was the effect of the presence

of oxygen on the body under examination, and here we had ample material

on which to make our observations. It apjaears that in every case where

oxygen is present, otherwise than as a part of the radical, it is attached to

some hydrogen atom in such a way that it obliterates the radiation between

two of the lines which are due to that hydrogen.' . . . ' If more than
one hydroxyl group be present, we doubt if any direct effect is produced

beyond that produced by one hydroxyl group, except a possibly greater

general absorption ; a good example of this will be found in cinnamic
alcohol and phenyl-propyl alcohol, which give the same spectra as far as

the special absorptions are concerned. . . .

tained in the radical ; when it is so contained it appears to act differently,

banded, or rather the bands are bounded by absolute lines, and are more

defined than when oxygen is more loosely bonded.'

Perhaps the most interesting passage is that which refers to the

detection o! the radical, and we therefore quote it in full.

    ' An inspection of our maps will show that the radical of a body is

represented by certain well-marked bands, some differing in position

according as it is bonded with hydrogen, or a halogen, or with carbon,

oxj-gen, or nitrogen. There seem to be characteristic bands, however, of

any one series of radicals between 1000 and about 1100, which would

indicate what may bo called the central hydrocarbon group, to which

other radicals may be bonded.

* The clue to the composition of a body, however, would seem to lie

between A. 700 and \ 1000. Certain radicals have a distinctive absoi'ption

aboat X 700 together with others about \ 900, and if the first be visible

it almost follows that the distinctive mark of the radical with which it is

connected will be found. Thus in the ethyl series we find an absorption

at 740, and a characteristic band, one edge of which is at 892, and the

other at 920. If we find a body containing the 740 absorption and a

band with the most refrangible edge commencing at 892, or with the

least refrangible edge tei'minating at 920, we may be pretty sure that

we have an ethyl radical present. So with any of the aromatic group
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

the crucial line is at 867. If that line be connected with a band we

may feel certain that some derivative of benzine is present. The benzyl

group show this remarkably well, since we see that phenyl is present, as

is also methyl. It will be advantageous if the spectra of ammonia,

benzine, aniline, and dimethyl aniline be compared, when the remarkable

coincidences will at once become apparent, as also the different weighting

of the molecule. The spectrum of nitro-benzine is also worth comparing

Wewith benzine and nitric acid.  should have liked to have said more

regarding the detection of the different radicals, but it might seem pre-

sumptuous on our part to lay down any general law on the results of the

comparatively few compounds whichwe have examined. In our own minds

there lingers no doubt as to the easy detection of any radical which we

have examined, but it will require more energy and ability than we possess

to thoroughly classify all the different modifications which, may arise.

    'We may say, however, it seems highly probable by this delicate

mode of analysis that the hypothetical position of any hydrogen which is
replaced may be identified, a point which is of prime importance in

organic chemistry.

     ' The detection of the presence of chlorine or bromine or iodine in a
compound is at present undecided, and it may well be that we may have
to look for its effects in a different part of the spectrum. The only trace
we can find at present is in ethyl bromide, in which the radical band
about 900 is curtailed in one wing. The difference between amyl iodide
and amyl bromide is not sufficiently marked to be of any value.'

     If we compare the results obtained by Captain Abney and Colonel
Festing with those arrived at by Professor Russell and others in the
visible part of the spectrum, we are struck with the great persistency of
these infra-red bands and lines. Spectra of different compounds of the
same body may resemble each other in the visible part, but wherever the
absorption band or line was sufficiently narrow to be looked at under high
dispersion some difference made itself apparent, like the one discovered
by Bunsen in the case of didymium compounds. These differences are
generally sufficiently large to be noticed even with one prism when proper
care is taken. It would seem very remarkable if atoms could enter into
combination with their vibrations unchanged by the chemical force; though,
of course, the change maybe more apparent in some parts of the spectrum
than in others. Whether the infra-red bands are not affected at all, or

whether only the change is so small that it has not as yet been dis-
covered, is an open question. Oar prismatic methods would, of course,
discover more easily a shift in the visible part than in the infra-red, but

Captain Abney and Colonel Festing used three prisms, and there can be
no doubt that if the displacements had been of the same order of magni-
tude as they are with the didymium, and especially the cobalt salts, they

could not have escaped detection.

     Alexr. Mitscherlich ' was the first to prove that compound bodies,
when luminous, have a spectrum of their own, and do not simply show the

supposed spectra of the elements. He followed up this important dis-

covery by investigating the spectra of different compounds of the same
metal, and he could not fail to be struck with the similarity which such

spectra often present.

     Many, for instance, will instantly recognise the spectrum of the oxide
or chloride of calcium as that of a calcium compound, without being even
aware that these spectra present certain well-marked differences. Com-
paring together the spectra of the fluoride, chloride, bromide, and iodide
of barium, as they appear on Mitscherlich's map, we detect at once a
strong similarity we seem to have one spectrum shifted towards the red

                                                                                                          ;

with increasing atomic weight of the metalloid. At the same time the
least refracted bands seem to be most affected and, as a consequence, the
bands appear nearest together in the fluoride and farthest apart in the
iodide. In the calcium and strontium salts we notice the same increase

of wave-length in corresponding bands with increasing atomic weight,
bat with these two metals the most refracted bands are most affected, so
that the bands are the nearer together the higher the atomic weight.
Mitscherlich tried to find a numerical expression for these relations, and
he expresses the law which, according to his observation, represents the

facts, in the following way :

                                        ' Pogg, Ann. cxvi. p. 499.
          ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF SPECTRUM ANALYSIS.                        133

     ' It follows that in the haloid compounds of barium (excepting the
fluoride) the distance between corresponding spectral lines is directly-
proportional to the atomic weight, and that in the haloid compounds of
calcium and strontium (excepting again the fluoride) these distances are
inversely proportional to the atomic weights. Further, that there is such
a point in the spectrum of each metal that the bands keep their relative

distances from it in the diflerent compounds. Here also we must except

the fluorides.'

     Mitscherlich's measurements were not sufficiently accurate to prove

his statement satisfactorily, but we can easily test it by means of the
more exact measurements of Lecoq de Boisbaudran, who has carefully

mapped the spectra of the chloride, bromide, and iodide of barium. A

glance at Fig. 2, which represents these spectra according to Lecoq's

                                                                                           Fis:. 2.

measurements will show their similarity. In Table VII. the first column
gives the wave-length of the bands seen in the spectrum of the barium
chloride. The strongest band is denoted by o, and the order of the
Greek letters gives the order of the intensity. In the second column a

of barium bromide, and the same wave-lengths calculated on Mitscher-
lich's supposition that the distance between the lines is proportional to
the atomic weight of the compound. The band a is taken as starting
point. The third column gives the calculated value for the band jo of
barium iodide, which compound only shows a and /3.

for the distance between a and y and between /3 and e is actaally larger

in the chloride than in the bromide, contrary to what holds for the re-

maining bands. In the case of barium iodide, Mitscherlich's rule cannot

be said to hold.

   A more satisfactory agreement could be obtained if the distances

between the corresponding bands were made to depend, not on the

atomic weights of the compound, but on the atomic weights of the

metalloid in the compound                                                                                                                                                but no object is  gained  at present by giving

such rules before sufficient material has been accumulated to prove or

disprove them. The second part of Mitscherlich's rule, which regulates

the displacement of the bands in the different compounds, does not stand

very well when tested by Lecoq's measurements ; the band /3 of barium

iodide, for instance, ought, according to it, to be at 5356 instead of 5376.

   We ought to inquire whether a connection can be traced between the

lines of a metal and that of one of its compounds. It would be possible,

for instance, that the oxide should show its bands chiefly at such places
at which we find lines in the metallic spectrum, and such a rule might

be suggested by the examination of the calcium spectrum, which shows a

characteristic group of lines exactly at the place which is filled by the

green band of the oxide. No general rule can, however, be given, and in

some cases even the metallic spectrum seems particularly free of lines in or

about the place in which we find the oxide bands. There is at present no

hope whatever of directly connecting the spectrum of a metal and that of

its compounds, though, as was seen, we may hope to gain an insight into

the relations of the spectra of such similar compounds as the chlorides,

bromides, and iodides, which may be supposed to have a similar con-

stitution.

Some very interesting changes have been noticed in the position of

absorption bands when certain colouring matters are dissolved in different

Weliquids.  mention the names only of Hagenbach, Kraus, and Kundfc

as having studied the question in particular cases. Two papers by
Kundt ' and Claes ^ contain all that is known at present on the subject,
and it will be sufficient therefore to consider them only. Kundt

examined the position of the absorption bands of chlorophyll, anilingreen,

cyanin, fuchsin, chinizarin, and of the colouring matter of the yolk of

egg when dissolved in a number of liquids. His results are given in

Table VIII., which is taken out of his paper. The solvents are arranged

in each column in such order that with the one first on the list the

absorption band is seen most towards the blue, while the one which

appears last disjDlaces the band most towards the red.

In the dissertation published by Dr. Claes we must carefully dis-

Wetinguish the experimental from the theoretical part.                                                                                                                                             have at present

no reason to doubt the accuracy of his experimental work, and as he

used solvents and liquids partly diffei-ent from those employed by Pro-

fessor Kundt, we give his results in Table IX. arranged in the same way

Weas Table YIII.  give the results for chlorophyll in two columns one                                                                                                                                      ;

refers to the absorption baud in the red, the second to the absorption

bands in the green. Magdala red shows different absorption bands in

two different sets of solutions, and two columns are therefore also

necessary. The results obtained with different didymium compounds are

not tabulated, as they are partly due to a different order of phenomena.

matter dissolved in it is placed more towards the red.' He divides the

solvents into four groups. While the order of the liquids within each

group may change, the second group will always displace the absorption

band more towards the red than the first, the third more than the
second, and the fourth more than the third. Dr. Claes, who also remarks

that the order of the solvents is not strictly that of their dispersive
powers, suggests a formula which shall correctly represent the position
of the absorption bands in different liquids. If A. is the wave-length of

the centre of an absorption band, his equation, when freed from tLe

sheltering confusion of ornamental variables, runs thus

               ^'-* = "+K^ .... (1)

In this equation i represents the dispersive constant of the liquid

that is to say, the factor of the inverse square of the wave-length in the

series which gives the refractive index as a function of the wave-length

and a, /3 are two constants which, according to Dr. Claes, have to be deter-

mined for each absorption band by means of its position in different

liquids. Now to ordinary minds the above equation seems simply a

restricted case of Kundt's original law that the wave-length increases

--with the dispersive power, for we can solve for X^ h, and this quantity

must therefore be a constant, which, on the face of it, it is not, as Dr. Claes

himself takes some pains to prove. Yet our author shows how the same

law in its new shape can with astonishing accuracy explain facts which to

most minds show no regularity at all. As it is a point of some importance

to possess a method of calculation which shall give such small differences

between observed and calculated values as those obtained by Dr. Claes, we
may take the trouble to point it out, especially as he might have still

further reduced these differences had he been more careful in his calcula-

tions with the two last decimal places. The secret consists in substituting

in the expression on the right-hand side the observed values of X and then

calculating the X on the left side. The differences between these two

values Dr. Claes calls the differences between the observed and calculated

--values of \. It is easy to see how this plan works. "Write A for \^ h,

and call the values which A takes in the two special cases L, and L2

then in the way suggested by the author a and /3 have to be determined in

terms of L, and Lj, and by substituting these values equation (1)
becomes

M2=A -L, -f L2  .... (2)

If we write L, + d for the observed value of A we get

^^A _ L, = Lo -  - -^^

--But the difference between A L, and d being the so-called difference

-- --between the observed and calculated value becomes - ^-^ ^            .

--As the total displacement Lo Lj between any two bands is small, as well

as d, this quantity is small compared to d. In other words, as long as
A, Lj and Lg differ by small quantities, equation (2) must necessarily be true
to quantities of the same order of magnitude, and any discrepancy must
ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF SPECTRUM ANALYSIS.  137

be of the second order of magnitude. It is needless to enter farther into

the matter, but it is easily seen how fictitious the whole investigation of
Dr. Claes now becomes.

     Returning for a moment to the general law discovered by Kundt, that

the displacement of bands depends to a greater extent on the dispersive

power of the solvent than on any other of its properties, we may, perhaps,
suggest the way in which such a result might be brought about. The
refractive index of a liquid does not seem to be directly connected with
the vibrations of its molecules, for we speak of the refractive index of
waves which are infinitely long, and connect it with the inductive capacity
which has nothing to do with vibrations. It is otherwise with the dis-
persion ; we know that the very colouring matters which are most sensi-
tive as far as the displacement of bands is concerned, show the so-called
anomalous dispersion, which only means that the nearness of an absorp-
tion band causes an abnormally great dispersion at that point. If we are
allowed to reason backwards and connect a great dispersive power at one
place with a great coefficient of absorption at some point which is not too
far removed, we might easily understand how these vibrations would in
their turn affect the vibrations of the colouring matter and change their
period. For it is a perfectly general rule that any spectroscopic dis-

turbance, such as the widening of bands or appearance of high tempera-
ture lines, is more easily produced by molecules which vibrate in similar
jieriods than by others,' and a solvent the molecules of which can vibrate
in similar periods to that of the colouring matter will, no doubt, produce

a displacement of bands towards the less refrangible regions. It is true

--that the high dispersion of some liquids such as carbon bisulphide

has not been traced to the influence of any specific absorption, but even

if, as is very likely, the above explanation is not strictly correct, we seem

to have in the vibrations of the solvent a connecting link between the dis-
persion of a liquid and the displacement of bands which it is capable of

producing. On the other hand it is easy to see why no perfectly general

rule can be given for the influence of the solvent will not only depend
                                                                                               ;

on the vibration of its molecules but also on the closeness of the connec-
tion between them and the molecules of the colouring matter. If there

is any great affinity between the solvent and the colouring matter we
should expect a great influence, and if the two bodies simply mix without
troubling much about each other we should have no displacement at all,
or only a very small one. The displacement of bands according to this

view is due then, in the first instance, to the closeness of the chemical
relation between solvent and colouring matter ; and, secondly, to the
similarity of their vibrations. If the dispersive power of a liquid enters
into the question it can only be owing to the fact that the vibrations of

the Inminiferous medium and those of the colouring matter are similarly
affected by the periods in which the molecules of the solvent are capable

of vibrating.

     It is proved by some experiments made by Professor RusselP that
the shifting of bands can also be produced by solution in a solid body.
Professor Russell has proved that when chloride of cobalt is fused together
with potassic chloride it gives a certain absorption spectrum, which may
be obtained with small displacements of bands when the potassic chloride

138 REPORT-- 1882.

is replaced by the clilorides of sodium, ammonia, or zinc. The bands
are nearest the red with potassic chloride, and nearest the blue with zinc

chloride.

    Before leaving this part of the report, we may just refer to some
experiments made by Professor Melde ' to decide the question whether two
coloui'ed liquids have the positions of their absorption bands altered when
mixed together. He found indeed that snch an effect conld be observed,
but all his experiments admit of an obvious explanation. To take an

ideal case, suppose in Fig. 3 the absorption of a liquid for different waves

of light to be graphically represented by the curve AaB, with a maximum

at a, and suppose this liquid to be mixed with another whose curve of
absorption is represented by CD, the simple addition of the two curves

will produce a third curve CA'5 D with a maximum at b. This maximum

is obviously not in the same position as before, but takes place at a wave-
length at which the two tangents to the two original curves are inclined
equally but in opposite directions. All the somewhat complicated rules
deduced by Professor Melde are easily explained in this way, and he
would have observed exactly the same phenomena if he had put his two
liquids in front of each other instead of mixing them together.

                      III. Relations of the Spectra of different Elements.

     Various efforts have been made to connect together the spectra of
different elements. The attempts in this direction generally assume that

certain lines in one spectrum correspond to certain lines in another
spectrum, and the question is raised whether the atom with the higher
atomic weight has its corresponding lines more or less refrangible. In
the opinion of the writer of this report no definite judgment can as yet
be given as to the success of these efforts ; some of the relations traced
no doubt are interesting and deserve further attention, but most of them
are far-fetched, and will very probably be proved to have no foundation

in fact. Lecoq de Boisbaudran* has led the way in these speculations,
and some of the similarities in different spectra pointed out by him are
certainly of value. But whether his conclusion, that 'the spectra of
the alkalies and alkaline earths, when classed according to their refran-

gibilities, are placed as their chemical properties in the order of their
atomic weights,' will stand the test of further research, remains to be

seen. Lecoq begins by comparing together the spectra of potassium
and rubidium, as well as those of calcium, strontium, and barium. The
spectrum both of potassium and rubidium begins, when heated up in the
Bunsen burner, with two red lines ; then follow, in the case of potassium,

a group of three yellow rays, four green bands, and a line in the yellowisli-

green (only visible in tbe spark). In the case of rubidium these are

replaced by a group of four red rays and four double lines in the yellow

and green. The spectrum of potassium ends with a violet line, since

proved to be double, and the spectrum of rubidium, as is known, also

ends with two violet lines. If we form the ratio of the wave-length of

the centre of each of the five intermediate groups in rubidium to those

of the corresponding group in the potassium spectrum, we obtain the

numbers 1-0G4, 1-065, 1-056, 1-058, 1-063, which numbers are approxi-

mately constant. The ratio of the middle of the two red rubidium lines

to the middle of the two red potassium lines is 1-022, and the correspond-

ing ratio of the violet lines is 1-04. If we accept the fact of corre-

spondence of these lines we see that the atom with the higher atomic

weight vibrates more slowly. The weak point of the comparison consists

at present in the uncertainty as to which of all these lines and bands

Webelong to the metal and which to the oxide.                                                        could not of course

attempt any correspondence between lines of the oxide of one metal and

the lines of the other metal itself. Similar relations exist, according to

Lecoq, between the two spectra we have discussed and that of calcium.

The two blue calcium lines concluding the spectrum are again less

refrangible than the two corresponding rubidium lines, and at the same

time they are wider apart. There is, therefore, a progressive change, as

pointed out by Lecoq, in the behaviour of these blue and violet lines,

which in every case are truly metallic. In potassium they are very close

together and in the violet ; in rubidium they are wider apart and less

refrangible, though still in the violet ; in calcium they are still wider

apart, and in the blue. If we connect this fact with the similar change

which, as we have pointed out, sometimes occurs in one and the same

spectrum, where double and triple lines go closer and closer together as

they approach the violet, we seem certainly to have a suggestive analogy

which may serve as the basis for further inquiries.

   We shall only follow Lecoq into his comparison between the spectra

of the chlorides of the alkaline earths, as his comparison of the metallic

and oxide lines seems to be uncertain.

    Both the spectrum of the chloride of calcium and that of strontium

consists of five bands. The differences between the bands of the chloride

of  calcium  gradually  decrease                                                 they  become  more  refrangible ;  and  the
                                                                              ;

same holds for the four least refrangible bands of the spectrum of

strontium chloride. Forming the proportion between the wave-lengths of

corresponding bands we find that the ratios of the bands of strontium

chloride to those of the calcium salt are 1-063, 1-065, 1-066, 1-070, 1-071,

and these ratios are seen to increase gradually with the decrease of wave-

lengths. The salt with the higher atomic weight vibrates, again, more

slowly. The spectrum of baz-ium chloride resembles in its general

arrangement that of the strontium salt, but it has six bands instead of

five, the central band being apparently broken up into two. Other dis-

crepancies are noticed on further inspection, and the barium bands, con-

trary to the rule given by Lecoq, are more refrangible than those of the

lighter metals. Lecoq gets out of the difiiculty by supposing that the

barium chloride spectrum which we observe is not the one corresponding

to that of the sti-ontium and calcium chloride, but that it is its higher

harmonic, and that we are to look in the ultra-red for the true corre-

spondence in the barium spectrum. This explanation may be correct, and
140 BEPORT-- 1882.

DOW that, thanks to Captaiu Abney, we may photograph in the ultra-red,
we may test its truth ; but we must observe that, if we once allow our-
selves to take these harmonics to aid, we may arrange all our spectra
in any order we like, for we need only assume that those which do not
fit are higher or lower harmonics of the true spectrum. As they stand

the spectra of the chlorides of barium, strontium, and calcium, though

showing certain characteristic analogies, do not bear out Lecoq's theory.
      Ditte ' has tried to find an analogy between the spectra of sulphur,

selenium, and tellurium, and to establish that the spectrum is displaced
towards the blue as we go from the metalloid to the metal, that is to say,

from the lighter to the heavier element. An inspection of the spectra in

question has not led the author of this report to confirm this statement.

The spectrum of selenium seems more contracted than the spectrum of
sulphur, but we cannot recognise clearly any displacement towards the
red or towards the blue. The spectrum of tellurium seems, if anything,
more to the red than that of the other two metals.

     Messrs. Troost and Hautefeuille ^ have compared the spectra of
carbon, boron, silicium, titanium, and zirconium, and they also come
to the conclusion that from the metalloid to the metal the spectrum seems
progressively to move towards the blue.

     As far as the fii-st three bodies are concerned the relation seems, at
first sight at any rate, to have some foundation, for we have here to deal

with three spectra which, on the whole, resemble each other in appear-
ance, and which seem to be displaced according to the suggested law.

      Ciamician ^ has compared together the spectra of chlorine, bromine,

and iodine. His experiments seem well conducted, and we therefore give

his conclusions, reserving, however, every opinion as to the degree of

certainty with which they have been established. It requires a much

more careful experimental examination than even Ciamician has given
to them to arrive at any proof of the reality of these analogies. The
spectra in question are so variable with density and temperature that we
cannot at present say whether we have to deal with a superposition of
different spectra or simply a variation of relative intensity due to tem-
perature. Some of Ciamician's analogies do not seem, certainly, to be

very apparent, but the following conclusion is entitled to a place in this

report :^

      ' The spectrum of vapour of bromine at low pressures becomes the
more nearly like that of chlorine the smaller the pressure, while the
spectrum of condensed bromine more nearly resembles the spectrum of
iodine. Iodine, on the other hand, gives a spectrum resembling that of
bromine at moderate pressures only ; at very low pressures an analogy
with the chlorine spectrum takes preponderance over that with the
bromine spectrum. The spectrum of highly condensed iodine vapour
 cannot well be compared with that of the other two bodies. Chlorine,
 when it is highly condensed, gives a spectrum resembling that of bromine
 at large pressures and of iodine at moderate pressures ; while at low
 pressures the spectrum of chlorine has no analogy to that of the other
 two elements.

      ' If we collect together for each body all the lines which appear
 separately under different circumstances, we can establish a complete

 correspondence between the lines of the three complete spectra.'

The complete spectrum of iodine is placed most towards the blue,

that of chlorine is placed most towards the red end of the spectrum.

In a subsequent paper Ciamician deals further, and we believe more

successfully, with the question. He begins by examiuiug the spectra of

the carbon compounds. The spectrum of cjanogen consists of two sets

of bands, one in the red and one in the blue ; the bands in the red

resemble the nitrogen bands, the bands in the blue resemble the carbon

bands (candle spectrum). Ciamician therefore suggests that the bands

in the red are due to the nitrogen atoms in the cyanogen molecules, while

the bands in the blue are due to the carbon within the same molecule.

There can be no doubt as to the correctness of the resemblance pointed

out by Ciamician, and the only argument which can be urged against bis

conclusion is the uncertainty that both sets of bands belong to the same

compound of carbon and nitrogen. There are some reasons for supposing

that they are not ; but as yet this is an open question. The spectrum of

carbonic oxide is very similar to that of the carbon (candle spectrum), as

has often been shown.

Ciamician makes a bold use of the division of the cyanogen spectrum

into two halves, which, as just pointed out, resemble the spectra of nitro-

gen and carbon respectively. For he thinks that we can divide the

spectra of some of the elements similarly into two parts, one part re-

sembling the spectrum of one, the other part resembling the spectrum of

a second element, and this division he suggests may be due to the fact

that such an element is really a compound body, wlaich is composed of
the two elements to whose spectrum its own is analogous. The high

temperature spectrum of silicium consists of a series of lines. The most

refrangible half of the lines certainly resembles in its general arrange-

ment to a marked degree the lines of carbon. The less refrangible lines

Ciamician believes to resemble some of the oxygen lines, but this analogy

does not appear very strikingly in the map which accompanies his paper.

Silicium at low temperatures shows bands which, as pointed out by

Messrs. Troost and Hautefeuille are very much like the carbon bands.

Ciamician has also for the first time succeeded in obtaining two

spectra of boron. Both the band and the line spectrum show a strikino*

resemblance to the carbon spectra. The line spectrum of aluminium

resembles in its most refrangible half also that of carbon, while its less

refrangible half resembles the less refrangible half of silicium. The com-

plete similarity of the spectra of aluminium and silicium, and that likeness

of their most refrangible parts with the complete spectra of carbon and

boron is the most striking analogy which has as yet been pointed out

but it ought perhaps to be added that Ciamician's drawing of the boron

spectrum does not altogether tally with the account given by Messrs.

Troost and Hautefeuille. The line spectrum of magnesium also shows a

likeness to  the  line spectrum  of carbon                                                and the carbon  bands  (candle

under certain circumstances, which according to Liveing and Dewar

always involve the presence of hydrogen.'

    ' An example may here be given as to the misunderstandings which may arise

owing to the confusion which reigns at present in spectroscopic nomenclature.
Messrs. Dewar and Liveing have pointed out the resemblance of the hydrocarbon
spectrum and the hydrogen-magnesium spectrum (Proc. Boy. Soc. xxx. p. 161, 1880).
Ciamician writes that he also discovered the resemblance ; but what Ciamician calls
the hydrocarbon spectrum is an altogether different spectrum, presenting no resem-
142 EEPORT--1882.

The likeness of the spectra of calcinm and strontium to the spectrum

of magnesium is not so apparent, but Ciamician traces it in taking account

only of the low temperature lines of strontium and calcium. The complete

spectra of calcium, strontium, and barium are also homologous according

--to Ciamician that is to say, we can find in each spectrum groups of lines

corresponding to each group in the other two spectra. But the comparison

seems less certain, for in spectra having such a large number of lines a

Welittle ingenuity will always discover certain likenesses.  do not mean

to imply that the resemblances pointed out by Ciamician are imaginary,

but only that spectra containing many lines ought not to be taken as tests.

The same remarks apply to the remaining groups of elements studied by

Ciamician, and we therefore only give his conclusions.

1. The spectra of oxygen, sulphur, selenium, and tellurium are homo-

logous. Corresponding groups are displaced towards the violet with

increasing atomic weight. (This last statement seems disproved by
Ciamician's own drawing in the case of tellurium, for out of 13 gi'oups

of lines, the 10 last ones are displaced towards the red.)
     2. The spectra of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony are homologous.

     3. The more refrangible parts of the spectra of the nitrogen group are
homologous to the more refrangible parts both of the oxygen and of the

chlorine group.

     4. The less refrangible parts of the spectra of the oxygen group are
homologous to the less refrangible parts of the spectrum of the calcium

group.

     The conclusion which Ciamician draws from these facts as to the con-
stitution of the various elements and the probability of their ultimate

decomposition lie, fortunately, outside the range of the present report.

   We add to the various facts already mentioned the great similarity

of the spectra of zinc and cadmium, which has often struck spectro-

scopists.

Professors Liveing and Dewar^ have drawn attention to certain re-

lations of wave-lengths which recur in the spectra of lithium, magnesium,

and of some lines which are often observed in the spectrum of the chromo-

sphere ; they draw from this fact the probable conclusion that these

Wechromospheric lines all belong to the same substance.      mention this

fact, as it is one of the first attempts to use the similarity of spectra as a

foundation for further conclusions ; but we doubt whether many of those

conversant with solar matters will agree with Professors Liveing and

Dewar. The way in which these different lines appear on difl'erent

occasions seems to suggest very strongly, if not to prove absolutely, that
the celebrated green line of the corona belongs to a difl'erent element to
that which gives rise to the other chromospheric lines. There is even
a diSerent behaviour apparent between the yellow and blue line referred

blance whatever to the spectrum which Messrs. Dewar and Liveing call the spectrum
of hydrocarbons ; and the spectrum which Messrs. Dewar and Liveing call the
hydrogen-magnesium spectrum is the spectrum which Ciamician calls the band-
spectrum of magnesium ; so that when Ciamician writes that the spectrum of hydrogen-
magnesium resembles the spectrum of hydrocarbon, he really makes an altogether
different and independent statement when Messrs. Liveing and Dewar make the same
remark. But Ciamician quite agrees as to the resemblance pointed out by Messrs.
Liveing and Dewar, only he expresses the fact by saying that the spectra of the first

order of magnesium and carbon resemble each other.

to by Professors Liveing and Dewar, but this may only be due to a

difference in temperature.

    No systematic attempt has hitherto been made to connect together

the different spectra of the same element ; relations which seem to hold
in one case seem again disproved in others, and no object therefore
seems to be gained by entering more closely into this matter at present.

Report of the GomTnittee, consisting of Professors Odling,

   Huntington, and Hartley, appointed to investigate by 'means
   of Photography the Ultra-Violet Spark Spectra emitted by
   Metallic Elements, and their combinations under varying con-

   ditions. Drawn top by Professor W. N. Hartley (Secretary).

The chief objects to be gained from a knowledge of the character of the

Spark Spectra of Metallic Elements, and of the combinations of the

elements, are :

    A(1) means of I'eadily identifying the metals by photographs of their

line spectra.

    A(2) knowledge of the alterations producible in the spectra of

metallic salts by the presence of various non-metallic elements.

    A(3) knowledge of the alterations in spectra caused by the dilation

of metallic solutions.

    A(4) possible means of performing rapid quantitative determinations

of metallic substances by the aid of photography, and obtaining perma-
nent records of the results.

     All these objects have been more or less completely attained, but on
account of the extensive inquiry which has been opened up, it is pro-
posed on this occasion to present only a preliminary report.

      (1) In order to simplify spectroscopic work, the time of exposure
required to produce the most characteristic spectra under various con-
ditions, such as intensity of spark and conductivity, &c., of the electrodes
has been carefully ascertained.

    A(2) long series of experiments has been made with the object of

comparing the spectra of various compounds in solution with those of the
elements they contain. In the process of photographing the spectra of

solutions it is desirable to eliminate all foreign lines as far as possible,

hence the selection of suitable electrodes was a matter of the first con-
sideration. Electrodes of gold, platinum, iridium, and other metals were
nsed, and those of gold proved decidedly the best, as containing the
fewest lines, and the metal being a most excellent conductor of elec-

tricity.

     All these metals are, however, useless compared with electrodes of
graphite. The spectrum of graphite consists of eleven or twelve insigni-
ficant lines due to the carbon, and about sixty-six lines and bands due

to air.

     (3) In comparing the spectra of solutions of salts with those of
metallic electrodes, it was found that in almost all cases the lines of metals
were exactly reproduced from the solution, the graphic character being
retained except in regard to their continuity. Discontinuous but long
144 EEPOKT-- 1882.

lines, or in certain cases even shorb lines, appear as long lines in the
spectra taken from solutions.

     The graphic characteristics of the lines seen in various metallic

spectra may thus be classified as
     1. Continuous lines. They extend the whole length of the spark,

and are accurate representations of the spectroscope slit.
      2. Discontiyiuous lines. Those whose length is not so great as the

distance between the electrodes.
      3. Extended lines. Sharp lines which extend above and below the

edge of the spectrum, or, in other words, above and below the points of

the electrodes.

     4. Blotted lines, or lines surrounded by a nimbus.
      5. Nebulous lines, or those which are destitute of the sharp clear-cut
appearance of most metallic lines.'
     (4) Insoluble compounds give no spectra when mixed with water or
glycerine and exposed to the spark. The non-metallic constituents of
salts do not yield any marked series of lines, and therefore do not obscui'e

the metallic spectra.

     (5) Experiments have been made to determine the extent of dilution
which serves to modify in various ways the spectra of solutions of
metallic salts, and that which finally causes the extinction of the most
persistent line or lines. The sensitiveness of the reaction varies with
different elements and with the period of exposure, the intensity of the
spark, and other conditions ; I have no difficulty whatever, when work-
ing in the manner here indicated, in recognising spectra yielded by solu-
tions which contain no more than xTnyot'i of a^jer cent, of calcium, silver,
copper, and ToTrT7TT^^ ^^ b. per cent, of manganese.

METHODS EMPLOYED IN CALIBEATION OF MERCURIAL THERMOMETERS. 145

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Balfour Stewart,
   Professor EliCKER (Secretary), ami Professor T. E. Thorpe, ap-
   poliited for the purpose of reporting on the Methods employed in
   the Galihration of Mercurial Thermometers.

                                                 [Plates I., IL, III.]

                                                    Introduction.

In drawing up tlie fcllowing Report the Committee have desired to pre-
sent it in the form in which it will be most generally useful. It is there-
fore divided into two parts. The first contains a brief description of the
principal methods of calibration and correction which have been hitherto
proposed, an account of the thermometers on which these methods have
been tested by the Committee and of the apparatus employed, and a
summary of the results arrived at. This portion therefore contains the
facts necessaiy to enable a selection from the various methods to be made
by persons intending to undertake the calibration or correction of a
thermometer. The second part consists of a fully worked out example of
each of the methods, together with remarks of a detailed character. This
part will it is hoped be useful in facilitating the calculations required,
especially as references to the subject of calibration in English scientific
works are rare and meagre.

       Part I.

       General Beviern of Methods of Calibration ami Correction.

     (1) The corrections for the inequalities in the bore of a thermometer
tube may be applied in two different ways, distinguished as methods of

calibration and correction respectively.

In the first the length of a column of mercury is measured in various

parts of the tube before the scale is etched on it, and the lengths of the
divisions are then so adjusted as to make equal differences of scale-

readings correspond to equal volumes. In the second the tube is in the

first instance furnished with a uniform scale, and a table of corrections
is afterwards drawn up, by means of which the same end is attained as
before. It will be shown hereafter that a high degree of excellence can

be attained by the former method, but although generally used, the

scales, even on good thermometers by well-known makers, are not, as

a rule, sufficiently correct for \evj accurate work. They therefore

require collection, and the process is rendered very laborious by the

varying lengths of the divisions which have to be measui-ed and allowed

for in the calculations. The results, too, are probably less accurate than

they otherv.'ise would be on account of the irregular forms of the correc-

tion curves produced by the superposition of the errors of the tube and

scale. A uniform scale, the divisions of which are about a millimetre

apart, seems therefore in general the most convenient. Such tubes only

should be used as preliminary tests have shown to be of fairly uniform

bore.

(2) As all the methods of calibration and correction to be described

1882.  L
--146 EEPOET 1882.

depend upon tlie measurement of tte length of colamns of mercury in
various parts of the tube, it is important to decide upon the best method
of separating these ' threads ' (as they will hereafter be called) from the
main mass of mercury in the tube and bulb.

     In general it is in the first place necessary to make the mercury run
from the bulb into the tube, so that a column of any length can be obtained
when the thermometer is at the ordinary temperature. To eifect this the

instrument should be held in a vertical position with the bulb uppermost,
and the other extremity of the tube should be cautiously tapped against
the table. If the mercury does not start it is well, as a preliminary, to
heat and cool the bulb several times. Tolerably rapid changes of tempera-

ture of a few degrees will often suffice.

     The transference of the mercury from the bulb to the tube causes a

vacuum bubble to appear in the former, and many writers, among whom

A. von Oettingen, in a work often hereafter to be cited (' Ueber die Cor-
rection der Thermometer insbesondere liber Bessel's Kalibrir-Methode,'

Dorpat, 1865, p. 46) may be mentioned, recommend the separation of a

column of the desired length by the proper manipulation of this bubble
and a system of dexterous jei-ks. In a wide bore, if the bubble is brought
to the junction of the tube and bulb, it is possible by a jerk to effect a
disruption between the mei'cury contained in the one and the other re-
spectively. It is, however, exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to apply
this method satisfactorily to thermometers with narrow bores, and the
violent jerks which are required are extremely dangerous to the instru-

ments.
      In all the experiments undertaken by the Committee, therefore, the

separation of the thread was effected by heat. The use of a blow-
pipe flame for this purpose has been recommended (Wiillner, ' Lehrbuch
der Physik,' vol.iii. p. 14), but such a course is unnecessarily violent and

 risky. Instead of this, a very small flame, four or five millimetres in

height, was used, obtained from the gas issuing from a narrow oi'ifice at
 the extremity of a piece of glass tubing drawn out fine. Into this the
 thermometer was introduced, care being taken to heat the tube equally all
 round, and the rupture was effected at the point where the heat was ap-

 plied. It is easy thus to break ofi" threads to within a millimetre of the

leno-th aimed at. When great accuracy is important it is advisable first

 to break oS" a thread longer than that required, and then to separate from
 it a portion of the desired length. Greater steadiness of the mercurial

 column while the thermometer is being heated is thus attained. Many
 dozens of threads have been broken off in this way within the experience

 of members of the Committee without a single breakage of the instruments

 employed.
       (3) Before proceeding further it will be convenient to define certain

 terms which will be frequently used.
      The upper and loiuer ends of a thread are those furthest from and

 nearest to the bulb respectively.

      The point at which the lower end of a thread is placed when a measure-
 ment of its length is made, is called the initial point.

     When by any method the corrections are determined only for a number

 of selected (and in general approximately equidistant) points, the points

 so chosen are termed -principal points. If, when the tube has by means
 of a svstem of principal points been divided into a number of parts the
 relative volumes of which are known, these parts are further subdivided

                                                                       I
METHODS EMPLOYED IN CALIBBATION OF MERCDEIAL THERMOMETERS. 147

by any method in wliicli the con-ections of the principal points are taken
as accurate, the points of subdivision are termed secondary iwints.

     The corrections for points intermediate to the principal or secondary

points may be determined either by interpolation formulae or, as is far

more convenient, by a graphic method. In the latter case the abscisste

are the nncorrected scale divisions, the ordinates are the corrections to
be applied to them, and the curves passing through the points thus deter-

mined are called correction curves. The curves employed in this inves-
tigation have been drawn on paper divided into millimetre squares. In
the line of abscissae two centimetres con-esponded to one degree, while an

ordinate of one centimetre represented a correction of 0░"01. In the case
of second approximations it was often necessary still further to magnify

the corrections and to represent 0░-01 by five centimetres. Time and

trouble are saved by using an open scale. In the plates the curves are

half the size actually used.

     If a thermometer has been corrected by several methods, it is neces-

sary in order to compare the results to transform the correction curves,

so that the corrections may be the same at two arbitrarily selected points.

These, which ai-e in general at the extremities of the scale, are called the

standard points, and a curve such that the corrections at these points are

zero is called a standard correction curve.

     (4) The transformation of a correction curve is exactly similar to
the conversion of a temperature from the Fahrenheit to the Centigrade

scale. On the corrected scale equal differences of scale readings corre-

--spond to equal tube volumes. This condition will still be fulfilled (1) if

all the corrected readings are increased or diminished by a given amount

(2) if the difference between any two readings is increased or diminished

in a given ratio.

    Let X be any point on the scale ^ {x) its correction. To make the
correction for the lower standard point I zero, we have to diminish all the

+ --readings by ^ (I). Hence ^the reading for x becomes x (l>{x) f (I).
   ULet and 0(U) be the upper standard point and its correction, and let

                = NU + 0(U) -(I + </>(!))    + a,

where           U -- I = N.

     Hence after the scale divisions are altered in the ratio necessary to
reduce the correction for the upper standard point to zero, the reading for
X becomes

     For facility of calculation this is thrown into the more convenient

148 REPORT 1882.

(5) Methods of calibration and correction may be divided into four

classes;

    The first contains what may be called the step hij step method, which

is due to Gay-Lnssac.^ In it a thread of mercury is measured in a posi-

A Btion B, then shifted to C, so that the lower end is in the position

previously occupied by the upper end, then measured again, and so on
for the whole length of the tube. From these measures the corrections

for the points B, C, D, &c. can be deduced.

    The second class contains what may be called principal point methods.

In these a number of equidistant points are selected on the uncorrected
scale, and the corrections for these are determined by means of threads

the lengths of which are approximately equal to or multiples of the dis-

tance between two consecutive points.

Several methods are included in this class.

Hallstrom's^ is a modification of Gay-Lussac's, in which an attempt is

made to prevent the risk of the accumulation of ei'rors inherent in the
use of very short threads. Two slightly different varieties of Hallstrom's

method are described by A. von Oettingen and Pfaundler, of which the

latter has been employed by the Committee. If the tube be divided into

Athe parts B, BO, &c. by principal points, a thread approximately equal

to two of these parts is measured with its lower end at each of the points

Ain turn.  second thread nearly equal to three of the parts is measured

with its lower end at each of the two lowest principal points, and from

these observations the corrections are deduced as desci'ibed in Part II.

    Dr. A. HandP has recently described a method of calibration which

appears to differ from those of Gay-Lussac and Hallstrom only in the

form of the calculations.
     Another method has been devised by M. Thiesen.^ The scale being

divided into n parts by principal points, threads equal in length to

1, 2, . . --ii 1 of these intervals are measured with their lower ends

coincident in turn with as many of the principal points as possible, and

hence the corrections are deduced.

Mai'ek* has applied the method of least squares to the calculation of

the corrections for any number of pinncipal points less than seven.

    By all these methods the corrections can be determined for as many
points as may be desii'cd, either by taking the principal points near

together, or by breaking up the intervals between them by secondary

-- --points. There is, however, one method Rudberg's" the essential

feature of which is the breaking up of corrected scale intervals into
smaller sections. This method therefore constitutes the third class, which

may be called that of repeated subdivision. In this method the tube is

first divided into two equal parts by measuring a thread of approximately

half its volume, when the lower and upper ends are in turn at the

extremities of the tube. These portions are then subdivided into three

C/, and C g . The process can then be carried further, as described in

the detailed account of this method.

   --The fourth class of correction methods also comprises one only ^viz.,

--Bessel's which may be called a distributed point method.

In this all the threads are measured with their lower ends at certain

selected points, but as their lengths are not multiples of the distances

between these points, but are within wide limits arbitrary, the cori-ections

are determined at numerous points more or less irregularly distributed

over the scale.

In von Oettingen's modification of the method the corrections are

finally calculated by drawing correction curves through the points deter-
mined by each thread, and taking the means of their ordinates. Pro-
fessors Thorpe and Riicker have introduced some changes into von

Oettingen's method of correcting the lower and upper parts of the scale.

An example of both systems, and a full discussion of the method are
given in Part II. Although too detailed to be introduced here it may be

said that the examples given prove that Professors Thorpe and Riicker's

alterations increase the rapidity with which the method approximates to

the true correction curve.

All the methods above mentioned (with the exception of Handl's)

have been tested by the Committee, and as the results are probably suSi-

cient for the practical purpose in view, they have not extended their inves-

tigation to several others which have been proposed by various writers.
     They may, however, refer to the plans suggested by Egen (' Pogg. Ann.'

Bd. XI. s. 529), Rowland ('Proceedings of the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences,' Juno 1879), and Pickering (' Physical Manipulation,'

PartIL, p. 75).

    (6) Many of the methods of correction theoretically require that one

or both ends of the thread should occupy definite positions in the scale.

It is impossible, unless the tube is uniform or is perfectly corrected,
to establish this coincidence at both ends, inasmuch as a thread which
would comply with the condition in one part of the scale would fail to
fulfil it in others. In the case, too, where the theoretical position of one

end of a thread is indicated by a scale mark, the breadth of this is often

so considerable that it is difficult to observe with accuracy the position of

the end of a thread which is concealed by it.
     Sometimes it is impossible, and often it is inconvenient, to bring

the thread end into its theoretical position. In cases where errors

might be introduced by this failure to comply with the exact conditions

of the method, they may be allowed for in two slightly diflerent ways.

     The first plan is that of farther approximation. The corrections for

the extremities taken out from the correction curve are applied to the

measured thread lengths, and then, by repeating the calculations with the

corrected values, farther corrections are obtained, which must be added

Ato those previously found.  second approximation is thus worked out

in Part II. in the second example of Gay-Lussac's method (p. 166).
     In some cases, however, if the threads are not measured in their

theoretical positions, it is convenient to avoid the necessity for a second
approximation by the preliminary use of a correction curve drawn by any

simple method. Let the thread end be situated at M, and let the cor-

rection be required for a neighbouring point, N". Let A' B' be an approxi-

ABmate, and  the true correction curve. (See figure below).

M = M =Let A'

                                                      /3.

Now, in the method of approximation, the assumption made in the

first approximation is that the right-hand side of this equation is zero, or

=that frXW) ^.(N).

   A --nearer approach to the truth is reached by neglecting a /) only,

and obtaining the values of ^i(M) and '^i(N) from an approximate

                             curve. Since the two curves in general
                             M Ndiffer but little, and
                                                      and           are always

                             very near together, the error thus intro-

                             duced is obviously in general less than that

                             --caused by neglecting ^i(M) 0i(N). In

                             other words, since the curves are nearly

                             Aparallel, the diSerence between A' and B B'

                             is in general much less than that between
                             M N M A NA' and B', or
-- --M                                                and B.

             N                    Theoretically, of course, the error due to

                             the neglect of a /3 would be greatest when
Mthe two curves sloped in opposite directions in the neighbourhood of N".

The only case, however, where a doubt as to the direction of slope could

arise would be near to a maximum or minimum, when the whole error

would be so small as to be negligible.

This method, which is employed by Marek (he. cit.), is illustrated in

the case of Rudberg's and other methods in Part II. Since by it the

corrections at points are determined from measurements made on threads

whose ends lie near to but not actually at them, the corrections may be

regarded as transferred by means of the preliminary curve from the

observed to the theoretical points, and it is convenient to refer to it as

the method of transference.

If the theoretical points are u and i, if the extremities of the thread

+lie at M  Am and i -f- A?', and if <l>{p.i) represents the correction at m, and

so on, the true thread length is

            Ф + Am + ^ (m + Am) -- +[i Ai + ^ +(i At)}

The corrections within the large brackets being determined from the

approximate curve, the expression contained in it is in this method used

instead of t, and is referred to as the transferred thread length.

  --(7) In estimating the value of any method, three points require con-

sideration viz. the accuracy attainable, the time and labour required,

and the cost of the necessary apparatus. The more accurate the appa-

ratus used, the simpler may be the method of calculation employed.

Thus, the chief objection to the step-by-stejj and subdivision methods is

that the errors are cumulative, and that by an unfortunate combination

of successive errors of the same sign, considerable inaccuracy may be

introduced. It is, however, evident that this objection would vanish if
METHODS EMPLOYED IN CALIBEATION OF MEECUEIAL THERMOMETERS. 151

the apparatus used for measuring the threads were sufificiently sensitive

to make the accumulated errors of thread-measurement insensible when
compared with the error of reading introduced when the thermometer

is used.

     The Committee have been able to study the results produced by

different instruments, as well as by different methods, as will appear from

the following restmie of the observations considered in the preparation of

this Report.

Some time ago Professors Thorpe and Riicker obtained a number of

mercurial thermometers for the purpose of comparison with the air ther-

Amometer.     full description of these instruments is given in Table I. :--

              Table I.
152 EEPORT-- 1882.

     ' The original calibration was so accurate that the second approxima-
tion of Bessel's method was unnecessary in two cases, and was only

partially carried out in the third.

    ' The maximum positive and negative corrections were in the case of

                   -Th. 561 + 0░-004 C. and 0░-004 C.
                     -,, 562 + 0░002 C. and 0░-005 C.
                     -+,, 563 0░-008 C. and 0░-011 C.

     ' As will be seen from the above description of the thermometers, the

larger of these quantities are about equal to the limit of certainty in

reading.

     ' In no case would the calibration error in the determination of a

Cdifference of temperature have amounted to 0░02

     (9) The remainder of the thermometers, viz. A, B, C, and Ri, R,, R3,
had been calibrated by the maker, and were corrected by Bessel's
method in the Physical Laboratory of the Torkshire College.

     The instrument used was copied from one devised by and kindly lent
for the purpose by Mr. T. Brown, which he has lately described to the
Physical Society.' It consists of a wooden base to which the thermometer
is attached parallel to a slot in which a small brass plate slides, carrying
with it a vertical microscope furnished with a spider line. The microscope
is moved by rackwork on the brass plate parallel to the thermometer, and
the distance travelled is determined by a millimetre scale. Readings can
be made by a vernier to O'l m.ni., and with the help of a lens estimations
can be made correct to 0"02 or 0'03 m.m. In the form described by Mr.
Brown a split object-glass is used to bring the mercury in the bore and
the scale divisions into focus together. In that employed in this in-
vestigation this was omitted, and the microscope was moved vertically
by rackwork to bring the mercury and scale into view in turn. This

worked well. Any error due to want of verticality produced in the

 measurement at one end of the thread would be compensated at the
 other, if only the direction of the tube remained the same. That it did so
 is proved by the fact that two measui^es of the same thread length rarely
 differed by more than 0'03 m.m., which was well within the limits of the
 sum of the estimation errors possible at both ends.

      This insti'ument was employed because it was believed that, with
 proper precautions, and with so accurate a method of calibration as
 Bessel's, it would serve to correct the thermometers to the required
 degree of accuracy. This anticipation has been fulfilled, and as the

 instrument is extremely convenient and relatively inexpensive, it may be

 well to state precisely the conditions under which it was used. Inasmuch
 as the thread lengths were required in terms of scale divisions, the instru-
 ment was never used to measure the entire length of a thread, but only
 the amount by which it was distant from a neighbouring scale division.

      (10) The position of the end of the thread was always determined by
 measurinsr the distance from the nearest division which was clear of the
 thread. Thus, if a and b be the extremities of the thread, and aa', be'

                                  ab

 the nearest scale divisions, the distances A a and b b were measured, even

 if they were much greater than A' a and b' b.

METHODS EMPLOYED IN CALIBRATION OF MERCDRIAL THERMOMETERS. 153

     In what follows, the nearest division therefore means the nearest
division beyond and clear of the thread.

     The word reading means reading on the scale of the calibrating instrn-
ment, and in terms of millimetres.

     In a particular thermometer graduated from 55░ to 107░ C, the mean
length of a degree between 55░ and 75░ was found to be 10'50 m.m.

    Hence, to convert readings between 55░ and 75░ into degrees, we have

to multiply by jJ^,,= -095.

     The corresponding factors for the whole scale were as follows :

=Between 55░ and 75░ the factor -095.
=75░ and 85░ ,,
=85░ and 90░ ,,,, -097.
=90░ and 107░ ,,,,-100.
,,                -104.

     The initial points chosen were 55░, 58░, and 61░, &c. The method of
exhibiting the results of the measurement is shown in the accompanying
Table II. which is made more cumbrous than in actual practice by a full
explanation of the meaning of the figures in eacb column.

     The results of two sets of measures only are given.
     The scales of the thermometers were carefully tested in various parts,
and it was generally found that a group of consecutive divisions, all of
which were equal in magnitude, was bounded at either end by other
groups, in which the length of a division difiered more or less considerably

from that of those included in it.
     This was no doubt due to the fact that the scales were already

adjusted by the maker to the varying dimensions of the bores, though
not with the necessary accuracy. It was therefore possible to divide the
scale into parts, throughout each of which the same factor could be used

for converting the readings of the calibrating instrument (given in milli-

metres) into degrees. An example of such a division is given above.
     It may here be stated once for all that in the case of all the thread

lengths required for the observations detailed in Part II. the corrections

for the varying lengths of the scale divisions were thus made. The tem-
perature, too, was frequently observed by means of a thermometer placed
close to that operated on, and the thread lengths were corrected by sub-
tracting 000016 of their length for every degree Centigrade above the
standard temperature for the set of observations in which they were made.

     The apparent mean error, taken without regard to sign of the

thread lengths measured by this instrument is about double that of the

more accurate instruments employed at Kew and the Owens College. In

the case of Thermometer C, which was carefully calibrated by Bessel's
method for the purposes of this Report, it amounts to 0░'0024, or about
0'033 m.m. As each thread was measured only once, and required four
readings of the vernier, this result is satisfactory. The error in the

estimation figures obtained by the vernier is indeed much greater

 than the error of setting the cross-wire to the point to be measured.
 Additional accuracy could, of course, readily be obtained by fitting
the eye-piece with a micrometer screw to read over 2 or 3 m.m. only.

Inasmuch also as in the method of measurement described the sum of the
two small quantities Aa, Bb (see p. 152), is alone required, it would be

 convenient, if a uniform scale were used, to transfer the mici-oscope
 from a to 6 by a screw or rackwork, without altering the position of the

vernier. The errors of reading would thus be reduced from four to two,

and the maximum possible inaccuracy halved.

     (11) In order to compare experimentally the different methods of
correction, the Committee have applied them to the same thermometer.
The instrument selected was thermometer C, and the methods applied to
it were those of Gay-Lussac, Hallstrom, Rudberg, Thiesen, Miirek, and

--Bessel the latter both as modified by von Oettingen, and also with the

additional changes introduced by Professors Thorpe and Riicker. The
measurements were made in the Physical Laboratory of the Yorkshire

College.

     Those for Bessel's method, and for the first example of Gay-Lussac's
method, were performed by Professor Riicker. The remainder, together

with much of the laborious calculation required, were kindly undertaken

by Mr. "W. Heaton, M.A., Demonstrator in the Clarendon Laboratory of

the University of Oxford, to whom the warm thanks of the Committee

are due for the labour and skill which he has expended on the investiga-
tion. It is owing to his help that they are able to present the Report

without further delay.
     In the first place the thermometer was corrected by Gay-Lussac's

method. The thread used was about 19 m.m. (l░-6) long. When it was

moved the lower end was always brought veiy near to, though not into
absolute coincidence with, the position previously occupied by the upper.

An inspection of the curve wheit completed showfed that the errors intro-

duced by these small deviations from the thedtetical position were abso-
lutely negligible. The length of the thread, "together with that of the
scale divisions in which its extremities lay, was measured twice for each
position of the thread. As when the thread was displaced, the lower end
lay in the same division as that which previously contained the upper,
each division was really measured four times, and the mean of these
values, which rarely differed by more than 0░-003, was taken as the true

value.

     The standard correction curve obtained is exhibited in fig. I,

Plate I.
     All the calculations, together with those required in the other calibra-

tions to be described, are given in Part II.
     In the second application of Gay-Lussac's method to the thermometer

the thread employed was somewhat longer, viz. about 22 m.m. (2░).
Instead of measuring each division in which the ends lay, the scale of the

thermometer was previously studied, and was found, as is usual in ther-
mometers calibrated by the maker, to consist of groups of divisions of
equal length. The values of these were determined and used as above
described. Another difference in the application of the method was that

it was now used as a principal point method to determine the correction

at every second degree. As, however, the length of the thread was very
nearly 2░, the divergence from the theory of the step-by-step method was

small, though considerably larger than in the last case.
     To eliminate any error a preliminary curve was drawn, and the

method of approximation applied. The distance between the positions of
the upper and lower ends (assumed in the first approximation coincident)

was never greater than 2-2 m.m. (0░-2), and the maximum correction

introduced in the second approximation was 0░'007.
     In what follows the correction curve obtained by the use of the thread

2░ long was used as a first approximation curve to apply the transference
156 EEPORT 1882.

of corrections above described to tlie various methods investigated. It is
shown in fig. 1, Plate I.

     Gay-Lussac's method was also applied a third time to the thermo-

meter. On this occasion a much longer thread 44 m.m. (4░) in length

was used. The method of transference was used in finding the correc-
tions, and the observations with the thread 2░ long were used (for the
sake of example) to obtain some secondary points between those found
by the longer thread.

     The points determined are shown in fig. 1 , Plate I.
     Hallstrora's and Thiesen's methods were applied to find the corrections
of ten principal points, Miirek's of five, Rudberg's of twelve. In all
these the method of transference was applied. Bessel's method was also
applied, the principal points being 2░ apart. The calculations were per-
formed twice, as above stated.
     (12) The following Table contains a statement of the number of
thread lengths measured in the application of each of these methods.

                                                 Table III.

            Method
METHODS EMPLOYED IN CALIBRATION OF MERCURIAL THERMOMETERS. 157

other justification of the course adopted is that, as will immediately

be showD, an error of measurement in Bessel's method is of relatively

little importance.

(13) This question is fully discussed in Part II. The following

Table may, however, be given here. If e is the probable error of a

mesingle thread measurement, and  the probable error of a collection,

the numbers in the Table are the values of m^, when ten principal points

have been found, and are therefore proportional to the squares of the

probable errors, or to the reciprocals of the combination weights of the

corrections of the scale obtained by the method to which they refer.

The probable errors of all thi-ead lengths are taken as the same, though

measures on long threads are less reliable than those on short, on account

of their greater mobility, and the greater value of the temperature correc-

tions with respect to the error of reading. In the case of Rudberg's and

Bessel's methods the numbers can only be considered as approximations.

                    Table IV.
--158 EEPORT 1882.

     (14) Perhaps, however, more is to be learnt from the curves actually-
obtained than from purely theoretical discussion.

     Unless the greatest care is exercised, the errors due to ' taste ' in

drawing the curves may far exceed those produced by mere instrumental

inaccuracies.

    An excellent example of this is afforded in the neighbourhood of the

point 135░ on Thermometer C.

   Figure 2, Plate I., gives a part of the curve obtained by the Gay-

Lussac method with the thread l░-6 long. The points surrounded by

circles are those obtained by the thread 4░ long. The dotted line is that

Acurve. Thus at 138░ a difference of 0░-012 is introduced.  similar

result was obtained with the two Gay-Lussac curves shown in fig. 1.

The dotted curve happened to have a point at 135░ where the correction

was found to be very low, in this agreeing with the Bessel curve, fig. 3.

     Column I. gives the principal points ; Columns II. and III. the
corrections according to Gay-Lussac's and Bessel's curves ; Columns IV".
and V. the mean excesses of the thread lengths, according as they are
corrected by one or the other curve ; Columns VI. and VII., the cor-
rections of the initial points themselves corrected by means of these

excesses. It will be observed that the differences are reduced, but as
the displacemeiit of each curve by the corrections is about the same, it
is difficult to say which is the more accurate between 100░ and 110".

     Another point of divergence occurring about 135░, all the threads
whose ends fell on this part of the scale were picked out, thirteen in,
number. Their differences from the means, expressed in thousandths,

were, in the case of Bessel's curve,

                0, 0, -1, 6, 1, -1, 5, 4, 0, -4, -2, -G, 2; total 4,

and in the case of Gay-Lussac's curve,

This shows that the lengths given by the Gay-Lussac curve are on
the whole too great, or that in this part it lies too high, and is the less

accurate. On the whole, then, the Bessel curve seems to be the best, as

theory would indicate. The extreme difficulty of obtaining an agreement
throughout to less than 0░-005 is, however, shown by the discrepancies
between the numbers given by Bessel's and Thiesen's methods. The
 probable error of a thread measurement is, according to the number given
 by Bessel's curve, 0░0025. Hence the probable error of a correction
 ought, according to Table IV., to be about 0░-0008 and 0░-001, according
 as it was determined by Bessel's or Thiesen's methods. They differ,
 however, in several places by 0░-005, and each receives independent con-

 firmation from one of the other methods.
      (18) The agreement in Table V. will or will not be considered good

 according to the standard of accuracy to which the readings of the

 thermometer, when in actual use, attain.
     Two members of the Committee (Professors Thorpe and Riicker) have

 frequently had occasion to read the same thermometer together, and they
 always agree to O^-Ol (O'l m.m.). This indicates a possible reading error

 of -4- 0░-005 (005 m.m.), when no lens or other aid is used. Pernet
 has~however, come to the conclusion that the distance between the fixed

 points can be determined to 0░-001, and thus Miirek and others think that

 a thermometer should be calibrated to 0░-002 at least. It may there-
 fore be convenient to lay down three standards of accuracy, defined by

 the conditions that the differences between the corrected and the true
 scales shall not exceed 0░-l m.m. (0░'01 in Thermometer C) in the first,
 0░-05 m.m. in the second, and 0░-02 m.m. in the third.

     (19) The observations on the Kew thei-mometers show that the first

 standard can be reached by a calibration conducted after Welsh's method
 with a good dividing engine. Inasmuch as the two Gay-Lussac curves
 shown in fio-. 1, Plate I., nowhere differ by more than 0░-12 m.m.
  (0░-011), except at the point 135░, where the difference could no doubt be
 reduced by a subsidiary correction near that point, the first standard is
  certainly attainable by a single Gay-Lussac correction conducted with a
  short thread and with Mr. Brown's instrument, provided that special
 attention be paid to the accurate investigation of maxima and minima.

       The second standard can be obtained with Mr. Brown's instrument
METHODS EMPLOYED IN CALIBKATION OF MERCURIAL THERMOMETERS. 161

either by Bessel's method or by the mean of two good correction curves

obtained by Gay-Lussac's raethod with short threads. This last state-
ment is proved by reference to fig. 3, Plate I. The mean Gay-Lussac
curve and the Bessel's curve are there shown side by side, and it will be

observed that at the points where the Bessel's correction differs moat

from Thiesen's, the mean curve diminishes the difference. As the Bessel

and the Thiesen curves do not differ by more than 0'007, nor the Bessel

and the mean Gay-Lussac curves by more than 0░"00o, the latter may

certainly be taken as correct to within this limit.

There seems, too, no doubt that any of the principal point methods

will, with Mr. Brown's instrument, and the methods of approximation or

transference used as in this Report, give the principal points correct to

O^'OOS. Among these the preference is certainly due to Thiesen's. It

must, however, be remembered that the points corrected by these methods

in this paper are too far apart to enable accurate curves to be drawn.

They are suflBciently numerous to enable a comparison between the

methods to be made, which is all that was desired. If they are used

to determine points nearer together the number of measurements required

and the labour of calculation rapidly increase.

It seems therefore better to use these methods only as auxiliaries to

a short-thread Gay-Lussac curve.

This should be drawn as a first approximation, the length of the

thread being a sub-multiple of the distance between the principal points

determined by the more elaborate method. The corrections at these

points should then be found, applying the method of transference by
means of the Gay-Lussac curve, and, finally, the measures made on the

short thread should be used to determine secondary between the prin-

cipal points. The third standard of accuracy is more difficult of attain-

ment. The discrepancies between Bessel's and Thiesen's figures in

Table V. prevent certainty that either curve is correct to less than 0░'002.

The method of least squares, as applied by Marek, does not seem to

produce numbers differing by more than O'OOl from those given by

Thiesen's method. The application of such calculations to so small a

number of measures is, indeed, of doubtful utility.

    The thread-lengths measured at Kew do not after correction, when

treated as above described (p. 159) to discover residual errors in the

initial points, anywhere show signs of an error as great as 0░'002. The

same statement, however, holds good for Bessel's curve, obtained in

this Report with Mr. Brown's instrument, and yet, as has just been

Onshown, it is difficult to feel certain that it is correct to 0░"002.  the

whole, therefore, there can be no doubt that this standard of accuracy

can be reached only by the most accurate apparatus and most perfect

methods.

The second standard in which the error of calibration is less than the

error of an unassisted-eye reading of the thermometer is that which will

probably be most generally aimed at.

For this purpose the Committee, after considerable experience of

Bessel's method on the part of some of its members, are (if an instru-

ment such as Mr. Brown's or a dividing engine is used) decidedly in
favour of the use of less laborious processes. The extreme length of the

calculations required by Bessel's method is in itself a serious drawback

an undetected error may vitiate many hours' work. The sanae or a less

Lussac's method, and taking the mean, would give an equally good

result with much less trouble in calculation.
     (20) On the whole, then, the Committee think that, if the following

rules are obeyed, an accuracy of 0░*05 m.m. in the correction of a
thermometer scale can be attained.

     I. If a dividing engine is used, select principal points about 40 m.m.

apart. ^

    Correct by measures on a thread about --m.m. long, employing Gay-

Lussac's as a principal point method. If necessary apply a second

approximation.
      This will probably be sufficiently accurate. It may, however, be well

to check by using a thread 40 m.m. long to redetermine the principal points
accordino" to Gay -Lussac's method, applying the method of transference
by means of the curve obtained with a short thread. Combine the results
of the two sets of measures at the principal points, giving to the values
obtained by the two threads weights proportional to their lengths.

     Use the shorter thread to determine secondary points. Examine
further any maxima or minima in the neighbourhood of which the

curves slope steeply.

     The total number of measures which would be required to apply this
method to Thermometer C would be ten on the long and thirty on the

 short thread.

      II. If an instrument such as Mr. Brown's is used, reading to 0"1 m.m.
 on the vernier and to less by estimation.

      Select principal points about 40 m.m. apart.
      Apply Gay-Lussac's method twice by measurement on threads 20 and

-- m.m. long respectively. Use the method as a principal point method,

  o

 and make the points originally selected principal poinis for both correc-

 tion curves.

       If necessary, apply a second approximation in each case.

      If the two curves obtained agree to within O'l m.m. their mean will
 probably be as accurate as is desired. In taking the mean the weight

  assigned to each should be proportional to the thread-length. If, however,

 greater certainty is desired, it may be well to determine the principal

  points, either by Gay-Lussac's method, using a thread 40 m.m. long, or

  by Thiesen's.
       In the former case combine the three curves at the principal points,

  giving the weights 6, 3, and 2 to the corrections obtained by the longest,

  intermediate, and shortest threads respectively.
       If Thiesen's method is employed and there are n principal points, the

  weights assigned to the three corrections of the r*** principal point will be

                    - - -3 nr {n r), 3 (w 1), and 2 {n 1)

  to that given by Thiesen's method and those obtained by Gay-Lussac's
  with the longer and shorter thread respectively. This gives so great a
  preponderance to Thiesen's method that unless the discrepancies are very
  great the corrections at the principal points practically depend upon it

  alone.

        ' The numbers given in these rules refer to a thermometer about 400 m.m. long,
  on which ten principal points are to be found. They can readily be modified so as to
   apply to instruments of other dimensions.
METHODS EMPLOYED IN CALIBRATION OF MERCURIAL THERMOMETERS. 163

     If these rules are applied to the numbers in Table V. the correction
at the principal points are found to be

                     118, 153, 106, 113, 134, 110, 110, 60, and 10,

as given by the three Gay-Lussac curves, and

                      121, 156, 109, 117, 138, 113, 112, 61, and 10

by the Thiesen curve.
    As these nowhere differ by more than 0004, and by that only near a point

where the Thiesen curve is certainly in error (116░), and as they nowhere
differ fi-om the results given by Bessel's curve by more than O'OOS, except
at 136, where the cause of the difference has been explained, it follows
that both methods attain the second standard of accuracy. The three
Gay-Lussac curves would involve altogether sixty thread-measurements

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

the Thiesen and two Gay-Lassac curves would involve 104, so that on the
whole it would seem better to adopt the former plan, and if when the
calculation is concluded there seems any reason to doubt the result, to
make another Gay-Lussac correction-curve, and include it in obtaining

the final results.

     The general result of the investigation may, therefore, be summed up

--as follows that labour is saved, and equal accuracy is obtained, by the

repetition of the simplest method of correction (Gay-Lussac's) instead
of the employment of more elaborate and, theoretically, more perfect

 schemes.

          Details of Calculations, with Examples of each Method.

(21) The following system of symbols will be adopted.
The upper and initial points of a thread will be indicated by the

letters u and i.

   An --uncorrected thread-length is therefore v, i, indicated by t.

The corrections at any point x to the first, second, &c., degrees of

approximation are indicated by ^jj (x), (p2 (a;), &c. Since the calculations
often give the differences between these quantities, it is convenient to

define

          f = -(^^)                          <P\ (Ф)
          92 (^)

and so on.

   A corrected thread- length is indicated by T, which is defined by the

equation

          + - +u'J: =, 9 (u) (i 9 (i))

In principal point methods it is convenient to follow Thiesen (Zoc.

citS) in the use of the symbol S, such that

          = -9+ +B(x l) (t,(x l)             (x),

+where the symbols on the right refer to the x V^ and x^^ principal

points respectively.

     In cases where the true positions of the thread-ends are not coincident

with their theoretical positions, the latter are often indicated by u and i,.

+the actual positions by ?t Am, and-i +Ai.
    When in a step-by-step method the correction is referred to the mean

point between the positions of the upper end of the thread and that of

the lower end, when next shifted, that mean point may be indicated by u.

     In the case of principal point methods it is often best to indicate the
position of a thread by reference to the principal points nearest to which
its extremities lie. Let the principal points be numbered from o upwards
in the direction of increasing scale readings, and let u' and i' be the
numbers indicating the principal points nearest to the upper and lower

ends of the thread respectively. By the substitution of these quantities

for u and ^ the above system of symbols will apply without further
change. In cases, therefore, where ambiguity might otherwise arise,
1', 2', &c. mean not the first, second, &c. scale division or degree, but the
principal points numbered 1, 2, &c. Where no ambiguity is to be feared
the dashes may be dispensed with.

                               Thermometer C.

     (22) The following is an example of as accurate a compliance with
the strict conditions of this method as is possible with Mr. Brown's

instrument.

     The lower end of the thread was always moved into the same division
and generally into the same part of that division as that in which the
upper end previously lay. The correction is applied to the mean of these
two positions. The thread-length was always measured twice in each
position, together with the lengths of the divisions in which the extre-
mities lay. The length of each division was therefore measured four
times, twice when the upper and twice when the lower end of the thread
lay in it. The mean of these four readings, which rarely differed by more
than 0░"003, was taken as the true length.

     In Table VII., Columns I. and II. give the positions in terms of
uncorrected scale-divisions of the lower and upper ends of the thread.
Column III. gives the difierences between these quantities or the un-

corrected thread-lengths (<).

    Hence, if the successive values of t be indicated by i,, ^21 &c., and if T

be the corrected thread-length

            - = - =Tf <,                             (99-66),
                               (99-66) .i.(9805)
            = - =-T(1) <^ ^o ^(101-27) V(99-66) 0(101-27),
            = =- -[ T ^3 0(102-89) 0(101-27) c(102-89),

and so on.            =(98-05) 0,

      If, therefore,

                      0(99-66) =c(99-66),

                      = +(101-27) ^(101-27) 0(99-66),

and so on.

    Now there are 26 of the equations (1), and addition gives

       =26 T - (i, +;,, + .... + ha) 0(141-85) - 0(98-05).

But the corrections of these two points may be taken as zero. Hence T
is the mean of the uncorrected thread-lengths.

     In Column IV., therefore, are the means of the readings in Columns
I. and II., or the points to which the corrections are to be applied (Ф).
In Column V. are the values of c(u) obtained by subtracting each of the
numbers in III. from their mean.

    In Column VI. are the values of ^(Ф) obtained by taking the sum of
all the c's up to c(n).

The ordinates of the standard curve are therefore easily obtained by

subtracting 0'069 from the numbers in Column VI. of the above Table

     (23) Another example of the application of Gay-Lussac's method
-was carried out in a somewhat different way.

  --It was now used to determine the corrections of points 2░ apart i.e.

as a principal point method.
    ,The thread-ends always lay in the divisions next to the principal

point, and as a first approximation the differences between the corrections
at the extremities of the thread and at the principal points were neg-

lected.

     The calculation for the first approximation is carried out exactly as in

--the last case. There were twenty-one principal points -viz. 100░, 102░,

104░, &c. These were numbered from to 20, as shown in the Column
headed u' in Table VIII. Columns I. and II. give the positions of the
upper and lower ends of the thread ; Column III. their differences, or the
uncorrected thread-lengths ; Columns IV. and V. the values of S (Ф') and

 --(u') obtained exactly as in the last example :

     With these values of (u') an approximate correction curve was
drawn, and the corrections for the positions of the upj^er and lower ends
of the thread were taken out in Table IX., Columns I. and II.

     Then, since the corrected thread-length

                                          = + (u + Am) -- +(i Ai),
                                          <i (l>            <P

the differences of the numbers in Columns II. and I. are entered in III.,
and these, when added to the corresponding numbers in Column III.,

Table VIII., give the corrected thread-lengths entered in Table IX.,

Column IV. The numbers in Columns V. and VI. are obtained exactly

like those in Columns IV. and V. in Table I. ; and, by adding the values
of (/)' (t/) in Table II. Column VI. to those of ^ (u') in Column V.

Table I., the values of fi ('^*') ^re found.
      It will be noticed that the differences between the values of f (u')

and 02 (^<') are not inconsiderable.

of the principal points are determined as before.
     This example offers a means of illustrating the determination of

secondary points. Let Pq and P be two principal points between which

n secondary points are to be determined. This may be done by apply-

ing Gay-Lussac's method to the interval by means of a thread=one n + 1"*

of the distance between Pg and Pj. If this thread has been used to
determine an approximate correction curve, transferred thread-lengths can
be used, and the equations

obtained in the present example.

                    Thiesen's Method,

                    Thermometer G.

     (26) If the principal points be numbered from to n, Herr Thiesen

employs a series of threads, the lengths of which are approximately equal

--to 1, 2, . . Ji 1 times the distance between two consecutive principal

points. He deals with untransferred thread-lengths. In the following

example, however, transferred thread-lengths have been used, but as

the method of transference has been fully illustrated, it is unnecessary to

exhibit the calculations. Each thread gives a number of equations of

the form            = + -T r,, <!> {u') f (0)

       (1)          T = r,,^,+f(u + l)-<t>(V)

                    =T r,,+ o + 0(n + 2)-<?.(2')

and so on.

By subtracting each equation from that which precedes it, the follow-

ing are obtained :

and so on.

     Now, the thread whose length is equal to the distance between two

--principal points can be measured in n positions, and hence from it n 1

equations of the series (2) can be obtained. Similarly, the thread the

length of which is twice the distance between consecutive principal points

--gives n 2 equations ; and in all there are

            ji - i + u - 2 +  -^+1^ = n (n -- 1)

equations between the c's.

     These are combined to find their values as follows.

   A table is prepared, of which the following is a symbolical repre-

sentation :

     In the example worked out, the lengths of the thread employed were
approximately 4░, 8░, 12░ . . 32░. In strict accordance with the method

as just explained, a thread 36░ long ought also to have been used. It
was, however, found difficult to manipulate so long a thread. Herr

Thiesen points out that a number of thi-eads less than the largest possible

number may be used, and the plan adopted below can easily be extended

in a case where more than one thread is wanting.

    Table XV. gives in the first and last columns the numbers of the
principal points between which the thread was measured. Column I.
gives the transferred thread-lengths. Column II. the differences between

the consecutive values of -.

     (27) Thiesen's method supplies, as has already been shown, more
equations than there are unknown quantities. Marek has, therefore,
applied the method of least squares to measurements made in this way
up to and including the case in which the tube is divided into six

intervals.

    As the formulte are somewhat lengthy, those only will be given which

suflBce for the correction of four points. First, let the tube be divided

into five parts by principal points numbered from to 5 (in this case the
dashes will be omitted). Let r,,,- be the transferred thread-length
measured between the ^t*^'* and i"^ principal points of a thread equal
approximately to the interval between them, and let the measurements
be made as in Thiesen's method, and let threads equal to 1, 2, 3, and 4

intervals be measured with their lower ends at as many principal points

as possible.

     As an example has already been given of the determination of

secondary points, it is unnecessary to carry the calculation farther.

                           Rudberg's Method.

                           Thermometer C.

    (28) A general outline of Rudberg's method has already been given.

A thread approximately equal to half the length of the tube is measured

with each end in turn at one of the extremities, i.e. in the thermometer

used at 100░ and 140░.

     Thus, if T be the true thread-length, and t^, t^ the uncollected lengths,

+and if when the lower end is at 100░ the upper end is at 120░ a, and

+when the upper end is at 140░ the lower end is at 120░ /3, two equations

are obtained as follows :

         = -T +i, (120 + o)                   (100),
         =T <2 + ^(14O)-0(12O + /3).

     = =Now, (j> (100) (p (140) 0, as these are the standard points, and, as
=a and ft are small, Rudberg assumed^ (120 + a) = ^ (120 + [3)
=when 2^(120) i!o-/i.                                           f (120),

     The considerable inaccuracies which may be introduced by these

assumptions are obviated by the method of transference.

     Thus, since the successive fractions into which the scale may be

divided by Rudberg's method are ^, g-, yV, &c., and as in this example it

was determined to divide the scale into twelve parts, the principal points

are

         100░, 103░-3, 106░7, 110░, 113░-3, 116░- 7, &c.

            (As modified hij A. von Oettingeii).

     (29) For a full theoretical discussion of this method, reference must
be made to von Oettingen's work, ' Ueber die Correction der Thermometer
insbesondere ilber Bessel's Kalibrir-Methode ' (Dorpat, 1865), which has

been frequently cited. It will be sufficient here to describe the method,

and to refer to some points in which it seems open to criticism.

   A scries of equidistant points are selected, extending over the whole

length of the thermometer-scale. The first of these should be at or near

the lowest point on the scale, and if (as in the examples here given) ten

threads are used, the tenth should be near the middle of the scale. Hence,

if the distance between any two consecutive points is taken as the number

of entire degrees or of half-degrees, which is most nearly equal to -^^ of

the whole scale, the conditions will generally be fulfilled with sufficient

Aaccuracy.  mercurial thread is then measured in terms of scale-divisions,

when the lower end coincides in turn with as many of the initial points

as its length will allow, and this operation is repeated with ten threads

of different lengths.

  --The conditions which these threads must fulfil as to length are that

when the lower end of the shortest is brought to the first initial point,

the upper end shall not reach the tenth initial point (practically, several

threads should satisfy this condition), and that when the lower end of the

longest is brought to the tenth initial point, the upper end shall be at, or

nearly at, the top of the scale.

The longest thread will thus be measured at ten initial points, and

Asome of the shorter threads will be measured at more.  convenient

arrangement is to take the shortest thread about ^, and the longest

about ^, of the whole length of the scale.

Observations other than those in which the end of the thread lies at

one of the ten initial points nearest to the bulb are, in the ensuing calcu-

lations, treated differently from the rest, and will be called the additional

observations.

    Tables XIX. and XX. give the thread-lengths obtained in the case of
Thermometer C from the first ten initial points and from the additional

observations respectively. For the reasons given above, the lower ends

of the threads were not coincident with, but only very close to, the initial
points. The error introduced by this fact will be discussed hereafter. The
initial points are given in Column 0, the thread-lengths in Columns
I. to X.

     Tables XXI. and XXII. are obtained from II. and III. by adding the
thread-lengths to the initial points, and thus give approximately what

would be the readings for the upper ends of the threads if the lower ends

coincided exactly with the initial points.

These tables give the direct results of the measures. It remains to

deduce from them the scale-errors, and it will be convenient to follow

von Oettingen's notation closely. Let Vj. be the mean of the numbers in

the Ц^ column of Table XXI., H^ the mean of the numbers entered in
MColumns I. to X. of the same table. Let
                                            be the mean of all the

numbers entered in Columns I. to X. of Table XXL, which is obtained

by taking the mean either of the ten V^'s, or of the ten H,.'s ; and, lastly,

points. It is proved by von Oettingen that the correction for an initial
point i,. is given by

                         -- +f (i,.) := H^

                              = +h,.
                           i,. constant
                          constant.

Now, if the assumption is made that the correction for the highest

initial point is accurately given by the first mean curve, the corrections

for the initial points are readily found by adding to the values of h^ in
-- mTable XIX., or /;,.
                         in Table XXIII., the quantity which is necessary
-- mto make /^lo or /i,o
                          equal to the correction thus obtained from the

curve.

Thus, in the example under discussion, the ordinate of the first mean
-- -- m--curve at 116░ is
                   -024. To make the value of ^,o  viz. -079

equal to this, -103 must be subtracted from it. Hence the correction for
-- -- = -98░ is
        -191 -103         -294, and so on. The quantities so obtained

are plotted down in fig. 1, Plate II., and produce the first initial point

curve (PQ R).

In order to combine this with the portions of the upper point cor-

rection curves which extend below 116░, von Oettingen gives to it equal
weight with them, takes the mean, and thus completes the first approxi-

mation correction-curve.

     The corrections for the initial points thus determined are inserted in

Table XXV. :--

     The entire continuous curve in fig. 2, Plate II., made up partly of tlie
initial point curve, partly of the first mean curve, partly of the two com-

bined, is called the first approximation curve.
      (30) If a second approximation is required, the theoretical procedure

is to insert in Table XXI. the corrected values of the initial and upper
points as given by the first mean curve. Hence, to deduce a corrected,
Table XIX., and to proceed as before.

   A considerable saving of labour can, however, be effected by dealing

with the corrections in the quantities in Table XXI. alone, instead of

with the quantities themselves.
     Thus the corrections for the upper ends of the thread taken from the

first approximation curve are entered in Table XXVI.
     In Tables XXVII. and XXVIII. the same operations are performed

upon these as are performed in Tables XXIII. and XXIV. npou those in
Table XIX. Hence a series of numbers are obtained by which the correc-
tions in Table XXIV. would have been altered had the measurements
been made with the scale corrected to the first approximation instead of

with the uncorrected scale.

    By adding the numbers in Tables XXIV. and XXVIII. the quantities
entered in Table XXIX. are obtained, which constitute the corrections or

the second approximation for the upper points.

for its initial points (both taken from Table XXXI.), be subtracted, the

corrected thread-length is obtained. These are exhibited in Table XXXII.
     The errors of tlie additional measures (given iu Table XXXIII.) are

obtained by subtracting the corrected thread-lengths from the uncorrected

lengths given in Table XX.
     If now the corrections for the lower ends of the additional measures

f .2(1',.) be taken out from the second mean curve, the corrections for the

upper ends can be calculated.

    On the whole, therefore, if the expression be written in the form

error amounting to O'OOl will be made.

105░, while 33 determinations of the corrections of equal value are made
between 122"^ and 129░, without including the additional observations.

      Such an arrangement of the experiments is evidently unsatisfactory.
It will be hereafter shown that von Oettingen has probably under-
estimated the value of the corrections of the principal points, but making

all allowance for the much higher value which should probably be

assigned to them, there can be no doubt that the correction is either
determined unnecessarily often in the middle of the scale, or at too great
intervals in the lower part.

      It appears, then, that the extremities of the scale are the portions

upon the corrections of which least reliance can be placed. This is

especially unfortunate. Delicate thermometers are now commonly

graduated for a part only of the range between 0░ and 100░ C. As, there-
fore, such instruments can have at the most but one fixed point, the
temperature value of a scale division must be determined by comparing
them at two temperatures with another instrument upon which the other
fixed point can be read. If two thermometers do not cover the whole

range between the freezing and boiling points, the comparison may have
to be made by several intermediate steps. Each instrument in a set of

such thermometers is, therefore, constructed so as to overlap those which

read above and below it. To avoid the necessity for having too many

thermometers, this overlap rarely exceeds one-fourth of the scale and is
often less. Hence the errors in the absolute measurements made by a
given thermometer will be several times greater than the errors made in
the measurement of the temperature- difference necessary to determine the
value of the overlap. The extremities of such thermometers should,
therefore, be the most carefully corrected, and yet it is here that the
method under discussion is weakest.

     Objection may also be taken to the method of grafting the initial

point correction curve with those portions of the correction curves for
the upper points which affect the same part of the scale.

    Von Oettingen, referring to an example in which eight threads were

used, says (he. cit., p. 14) : ' Fiir die Curve der arithmetischen Mittel . . .
sind ausser den 64 Verbesserungen der 8 mal 8 oberen Fadenenden, noch
die enimal 8 Correktionen der unteren Enden hinzugenommen. In der
That haben diese Verbesserungen dasselbe Grewicht wie der oberen Enden.'

     This view appears open to objection. It is quite true, as von Oettingen
adds, that the expressions obtained by him for the corrections of an upper
and a lower point both contain the same assumptions, which are only

--approximately true viz., that the sum of the errors of any row and of any

=column are separately 0.

     But he determines the ei'ror of the topmost initial point (116) from
the means of the curves of the upper points. To this, therefore, the full
weight, 10 (if 10 threads are used), must be assigned.

   -- = --In using the formula (p (i'g) ([> ('i,o) /ig 7i,o, the only quantity

neglected is the difference of the means of the corrections of the upper
points in the ninth and tenth rows. Now, since the upper points in these

-- -- --rows extend over nearly the same part of the scale, the difference of these

quantities i.e. //'t, /i',o must be small. In the example given it
amounts to 0░'007. Hence (/> (uj) must be known with considerable

accuracy. The value of f (ig) will be more doubtful, and so on. On

the other hand, the weight 10 is perforce assigned to corrections given
by the initial point curve at the lower end of the scale, inasmuch as no
--192 EEPORT 1882.

othera are available. It seems, tberefore, unreasonable to entrust the cor-

rection entirely to the initial point curve up to the point where the first

upper point curve overlaps it, and then suddenly to regard it as of equal
value to this, which is itself only one out of ten carves which are used to

determine the correction in the centre of the scale.

Experiment fully confirms this view. In no case, either of examples

worked out by members of the Committee or of those given by von

Oettingen, do the corrections given by the initial point-curve differ on a

first approximation from the values they ultimately assume so much as

do many of those given by the upper point curves.

     (32) In calibrating their thermometers, therefore. Professors Thorpe
and Riicker thought it better to weight the initial point curve 10, the

upper point curves being weighted 1, to introduce the additional measures
in the first approximation, and to determine the initial point of any

additional measure with full accuracy before using it to determine the

error of its upper point.

For this purpose the calculations were carried on exactly as in the

previous method up to and including Table XXIV., and the upper point
and initial point curves were drawn. The mean ordinates of the upper

point curves were calculated from the highest initial point (116░) up to
the point where the first upper point curve ended (123░). The means of

the lower parts of the upper point curves and of the initial point curve

were then taken, giving the latter the weight 10, and thus the fii-st mean

curve was formed from 98░ to 123░. It is given in fig. 1, Plate III.
    The additional observations were now at once introduced, and the

calculations required the gradual building up of five Tables at the same

time.  The  highest point  given  by  Thread  I.  is  at  123░-9                                 hence  the

The curve is exhibited in fig. 3, Plate I.

     (34) On oomparing the two methods a glance at the first and second

approximation curves in fig. 2, Plate II., and fig. 1, Plate III., establishes

a primd-facie case in favour of that adopted by Professors Thorpe and

Rlicker. In von Oettingen's method there is a considerable difference

between the two curves at the part affected by the additional measures,

and also at the points where the initial and upper point curves overlap.

In the curve obtained by the second method, the agreement is perfect at

the top of the scale, and very much better in the neighbourhood of the

overlap. The greatest difference occurs at the points which the previous
--discussion indicates as the weakest namely, the lower initial points.
--The much closer agreement between the values of h',. m', and of
-- --Ji'^
     i)i'  'w,., exhibited in fig. 3, Plate III., than between those in

fig. 3, Plate II., is also a point in favour of attributing the weight 10 to

the initial point curve.

It is, however, possible to submit the differences in the neighbour-

hood of the overlap to a closer investigation. The values of h'' in Tables

 XXXI. and XLV. enable the correction of the initial points to be carried

,

a stage further. It follows from the investigation of the correction of

the initial points already given (p. 187) that, just as in the first appi-oxi-

mation, the process of combining the initial and upper point curves

+changes ^ (i^) into (l> (i,.)  -nr,. ; so, in the second approximation, it will

+change (p' (i,.) into (j)' (/,.)  иct',.. Hence, if ^p' (/,.) is the difference be-

tween the second and first mean curves at the o-^^ initial point,

                          ^' (Q = f (V) + -'-

     By a method similar to that by which the correction Avas obtained in

,

the second approximation, the third correction is now found to be

     = - + + + +i</." (i)
                 H,.            h'^ -,V {f (n,,,.)                 (u,,,)             &c.}

     Now, since in Tables XXXI. and XLV. the whole correction is taken

I

-- --out i.e. (j>2 (Ф) and not merely the difference between the first and

--second approximations i.e. (j)' (?;).

+ + + =i                                                            h"

                                          I''

and since                          = --<j> (v) H^ i,,

and                       = - f^\. ^P' (i)              (i,),

it follows that       = - -<}>" (i,)

   +As -ra-,. \p' (v) is the difference between the second mean curve and

the first initial point curve, this expression is exactly comparable with

that obtained in the first approximation.

     In Table LI. the values of (p" (r,.) are calculated according to both

methods.

     The values of <(>" (i,.) reqiiire the addition or subtraction of a constant

in order to bring the curves given by them into agreement at one point
with that obtained from the second mean curves. The cori'ected curves

could then be made to pass through the standard points.
     As, however, the values of ({>" (/,.) are ncai'ly the same at 100░ and

116░, and as the resulting corrections ai'e very small, no appreciable

error will be committed if they ai^e considered as applied directly to the

Astandard curves.     third approximation to the corrections of the initial

points may therefore be obtained, under conditions such that the two
methods may bo compared by adding to the values of ^" (i,.) the correc-

tions for the initial points taken from the standard curves, together with

the constants (K) necessary to make the corrections at 100░ zero.

     This operation is performed in Table LII.

 200 EEroET-- 1882.

       In Table LII., the last three columns are in virtnal agreement, while
 the second difiPers from all of them in that the correction in the neighbour-
 hood of 108░ is too great. This is exactly what would occur on the
 assumption that von Oettingen had not given sufficient weight to the

 initial jioint curve.

     The maximum error would occur in the neighbourhood of the point

 where the initial and upper point-curves first overlap, as there, owing to
 the small number of the upper point-curves, the errors introduced by
 them would be most important. The nature of the error would be such
 that the correction carves would be deflected too far in the direction of
 the upper point-curves, and finally it Avould be eliminated by a sufficient
 number of approximations.

      All these conditions are fulfilled. The overlap begins at 106. At
 that point there is a sudden increase in the difference between the first and
 second approximations, which is a maximum at 108░. The upper point-
 curves lie above the initial point-curve ; and the second apj^roximation,
 given by von Oettingen's method, lies above the third. The third
 approximation agrees very closely with the second and third approxima-
 tions obtained by Professors Thorpe and Riicker's method, which are them-

 selves in virtual agreement.

      The upper part of von Oettingen's curve is, however, for the most
 part above that obtained by the other method, and this error is no doubt
due to the less rapid approximation obtained by ranking the initial point-

 curve as equal to one of the upper point curves only.

     On these grounds, therefore, the curve calculated, on the supposition

that the initial point-curve is equivalent in value to ten of the upper
point-curves, will be taken as the standard.

      (35) Only one other point with regard to Bessel's method requires
investigation, viz. the error introduced by the measurement of the thread,
not at, but near, the principal points. Let the true lengths of the divi-
sions on which the upper and lower ends of a thread lay be 1 -H c?,, and

+1 di. Let y be the fraction of the division in which the lower end lay

by which that end was distant from the principal point. Had the thi-ead

been pushed back through this distance its length would have been

--increased by ?/((?,, d^.

     All the numbers in Tables XX. and XXI. must therefore be increased

by this amount. Assuming y to have a mean value y throughout, and

inserting this correction in the formula on p. 182, it is easily proved that
the added correction of U^^ is

           1 _y[^^rd. - d,^ - S,c7,, _!_ S,, S.cZ,,},

where S,. d,, and S^, d,,, are the sums of all the values of d,, in the r"^ row,
and the Ц^ column respectively, and S^. S,. c?,,, is the sum of all the values

of c7,,.

    --The correction for the r^^ initial point is increased by y {S,.(7,, d,]

    On taking out the values of d^ and d^ from the curves in fig. 1, Plate

III., it is found that the largest correction for any upper point is
0-002y, and for any initial point Q-OOoy, and since the value of y is about
0-3, the error introduced cannot exceed 0░001. The mean curves may,
therefore, as far as this error is concerned, be taken as correct to 0░001,
and it has therefore been neglected.

                        Effect of Errors in Measurement of Threads.

     (3G) The errors introduced in a correction-method depend partly upon
the magnitude of the false assumptions made in the method itself, partly
upon errors in the measurement of thread.

     It has been shown that the former may be obviated to a great extent

by approximation or transference ; it remains to investigate the latter. It
has been thought better to treat of this subject by itself in oi-der to avoid
the complication which it introduces into the discussion of the various
methods. It is proposed here to investigate tlae probable errors of the
corrections of the principal points in terms of the errors in the thread-
measurements. The probable error of a thread-measurement will be

=considered the same in all cases and taken e. It must, however, be

remembered that, in all probability, for reasons already given, long
threads are less accurately measured than short.

                                         Gat-Lussac's Method,

     The equations (1) (p. 164) show that in the case of Gay-Lussac's
method the correction for the r*** principal point is

        -- VrTMlm                        --v          ^V1             V  yn         --n. r

In the case of Hallstrom's method the relation between the corrections

and the thread-lengths are more complex. They may, however, be

obtained as follows. In Table LIII. the first column gives the various

B's, the other columns the coefficients with which r's and o-'s occur in

the expressions for them.

where in each case n is the number of the principal point.

                          Thiesen's Method.

     In the case of Thiesen's method the relation between the corrections

--and the measures is simpler. Suppose the observations complete i.e. no

threads to be wanting.

      Referring to the table on page 172, it is evident that the correction for

the J-* principal point is the sum of all the columns up to and including
the r*^ divided by 10. But the figures in any rectangle of which the O's
form the diagonal cancel one another. Thus the correction for any
point is one-tenth of the sum of the figures in all the columns np to the

r^^ with the rectangle in question cut off.

     For instance, if in Table XVI. (p. 174), the blank space be filled up
with the correct number afterwards found, the correction for i, is one-
tenth the sum of the figures.

All the numbers in any diagonal sucb as that through which the

line is drawn are obtained from the same thread. They are the

differences of successive thread-lengths, and therefore their sum depends

only on the first and last. In other words, the number of independent

measures used in finding the corrections is twice the number of the

diagonals, i.e. it is in all cases 18.

                                         Marek's Method.

     Marek gives the formulae for finding the probable error of a correcfion.
When, as is the case worked out, the tube is divided into five parts, the

(2?. e's) ^ are
                           0- 0-29 e2 0-28 e2 0-2-8e2 и0-29 e2
204 EEroET-- 1882.

     These are, of course, not comparable with the others above obtained, as
the subdivision of the tube is different.

= If the tube is divided into five jDarts by Thiesen's method the (p. e)^
     0-32e2.

                       Bessel's Method.

     The above method is not strictly applicable to Bessel's corrections,
but it may be approximately applied as follows :

    Each value of h,. depends on 10 independent measurements. Hence

                       = --{p. e. h,y  , &c.

Each value of ^ (Uir) depends on 100 measures.

Ten of these arc introduced with the coefficient O'l in r^., ten (of

which one is common to this and last group) with the coefficient O'l in

--h^, and 100 with the coefficient 0*01 in the m. One, viz., U/^^ itself,
--appears again with the coefficient
                                       1. Hence 81 will have the
--coefficient 001, 18 will have the coefficient 0'09, and 1 the coefficient
-- ^ --1 + 0"2 -- 001
                       '81. Hence the probable error of a single thread-

correction is :

+ + ={81 X 0-0001 18 X 0-0081 (-81) '-} e^ -81 e\

a result which strongly confirms the view expressed above as to the rela-

tive values of the initial point and other corrections.

     Let it next be supposed that all the corrections in the diagonal which

passes from the lower left to the upper right-hand corner of Table XIX.

(p. 180), refer to the same point.

     Hence the final correction will be the mean of the ten. These are not

independent. Each number in the Table will occur ten times.

    --Ten, viz., the numbers in the diagonal, will have the coefficient 081

--once, and O'Ol nine times. Their coefficients in the mean will therefore
--be 0-09. The remaining ninety will have the coefficient 0-09 twice,
--and 0-01 eioght times. Their coefficients in the mean will therefore be

                       ^ 0-18 -0-08 =0-01
                           II

Hence the probable error of the correction will be e^, multiplied by

^ =10 X (009)2 + 90 X (0-01)2
                       +0-081                 0-009 0-09.

     For comparison with the other methods referred to, it would be better
to take Bessel's method with five principal points 4░ apart. The probable
errors of an initial point, and a mean upper point, would then be 0-2 e^ and

*15 e^, respectively.
           ox THE EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA OF JAPAN.                  205

Second Report of the Committee, consisting of Sir A. C. Eamsay,

   Mr. Thomas G-ray, and Professor John Milne {Secretary),

   appointed for the puiyose of investigating the Earthquake

   Phenomena of Japan. Drawn up by the Secretary.

 The^ seismological work which I have been engaged upon since the

British Association, in 1881, generously placed in my hands a grant of

 25Z. as an assistance towards the investigation of the earthquake pheno-

mena of Japan, has been partly the continuation of experiments and
observations on which I was previously engaged, and partly an endeavour

to carry out experiments which are more or less new.

      The results of a portion of this work have already been published in
the 'Transactions of the Seismological Society of Japan.' The o-reater

portion, however, of the observations which have been made are still in a
rough form, and considerable time and labour will have to be expended
upon them before they are ready for publication. The results to which
many of these observations lead are, however, sufficiently well defined to
be described in general terms, and this I propose to do in the followino-
brief report. The order in which the various investigations are referred

to is as nearly as possible the same as that which was followed in my first

report to this Association. They are as follows :

     I. Determination of tie areas from luUcli the shakings so often felt in
ToTcio and YoJcohama emanate.

    myIn first report it was stated that the origins of three earthquakes

had been located near to or in the Bay of Yedo, at no great distance from
Yokohama. Owing to the fact that there was often a confusion of normal
and transverse vibrations, or to the fact that even if the ground moved
backward and forward in a definite direction this did not of necessity

correspond to the direction of a line connecting the point of observation

and the origin, the origins of many other earthquakes which had been felt

had not been determined.

    During the last year, in consequence of my having established at

various places a number of instruments which give graphical records of
all the prominent vibrations of an earthquake, instead of simply indicating

the extent and direction of the maximum disturbance, I have been
enabled to determine approximately the origins of a considerable number

of disturbances. The instrument here referred to I call a pendulum

seismograph. It is described in Vol. IV. of the ' Transactions of the
Seismological Society.'

     These instruments have been distributed as follows :

--206 REPORT 1882.

     Examples of the records obtained from these instruments, which

records are written on plates of smoked glass that are subsequently var-

nished and photographed, are given with the description of the instru-

ment. The greater number of earthquakes which have been recorded
in Tokio have also been recorded in Yokohama, Chiba, and Kisaradzn.

Now and then the same earthquake has also been recorded in Kamaishi,

and now and then even in Hakodate and Saporo. In no instance during

my seven years' i-esidence in Japan have earthquakes, even when they

have originated so near to Yokohama as to destroy chimneys and to
completely unroof houses, been propagated so far sonth as Kobe. So

far as ordinary earthquakes are concerned Kobe belongs to a special

seismic area. Nagasaki in a similar manner is independent of all the

other districts where seismographs have been placed. The reason why

an ordinary earthquake in North-Eastern Japan is unable to spread far
beyond Yokohama towards the south-west apparently depends upon the
fact that in going southwards it is intercepted by many high and
broad tracts of mountainous country. For a similar reason these same
earthquakes are unable to cross the central backbone of the island, and so
disturb the inhabitants upon the eastern shores. These facts have been
illustrated in a very remarkable manner during the last year by an
analysis of some hundreds of communications which I have received from

various parts of North Japan.
     These communications were obtained by sending to the Government

offices at all the important towns within a radius of from 60 to 100
miles of Yedo bundles of post-cards, with a request that every week one
of these cards should be returned with a statement of the earthquakes

which had been felt. The result obtained by the examination of these
communications showed that a great number of earthquakes came from
the north-east, and hardly ever passed the ranges of mountains to the west
and south-west. Subsequently the boundary of the post-card area was
extended farther to the north, and the result which was obtained showed
that many earthquakes came from the sea on the east._ The general
results obtained by this system of investigation are exhibited in a seis-
mological atlas which is being prepared for North Japan, in which the

area "shaken by every shock has been tinted, the dark tints indicating
where the shock was most severely felt, or where there were a number
of shocks at short intervals corresponding to the single shock felt at
more distant localities. The information to be derived from this series

of maps is                                                    whi iиcih  и

1st.        An approximate origin for many of   the  shocks,             is  of  great

value as a check upon the records of instruments and an assistance to

their interpretation.

     '2nd. In North-Eastern Japan there appear to be several^ seismic

centres, and from these centres ordinary disturbances only radiate into
surrounding districts, the boundaries of which are sharply defined by

certain ranges of mountains.

     3rd. The greater number of seismic centres appear to be beneath the

ocean.      In the  case of  heavy shocks, and  shocks which  have       oriи giи natj. ejd
      4th.
some distance out at sea, the disturbance may be felt over the whole ora
great portion of North-Eastern Japan, from Saporo and even Nemuro in

the north to Yokohama in the south.

5th. Although disturbances may be felt for several hundreds of miles
      ON THE EARTUQUAKE PHENOMENA OF JAPAN.                                                  207

along the eastern shores of Japan, it is seldom that they cross the moun-
tains to the north-western coast, which is singiilarlj free from earthquakes
One inference to be drawn from the above observations is that the
disturbance, as felt upon the land, is to a great extent superficial, and on
reaching the mountains is either destroyed by reflections and refractions
or else absorbed by their mass.                                                              '

     In the case of earthquakes where there were prominent vibrations
having a definite direction, a prolongation of lines parallel to these
directions through the observation stations has given intersections

corresponding with the locality in which we should seek for the origin of

the disturbance from the records of the post-cards. When prominent

movements in two or more directions had been recorded, the one which
had to be taken to represent the normal motion was indicated by the
approximate origin shown by the post-cards.

These determinations were further checked by time observations
musually made in Yokohama, Tokio,
                                        and Chiba. Sometimes they were
also made Saporo and Hakodate.           Assuming these time observations

to have been correct, and the velocity of an earthquake to be constant it

is theoretically possible by several methods to determine the orio-in of a
disturbance. Although these methods fail in practice, chiefly o'Win? to
the fact, which I will speak of presently, that the assumed velocity is not
mconstant, the observations lead to very sure and practical deductions as

to the direction which we are to look for the origin of a shock.

II. Velocity of Propagation of an Earthquake Wave.

     The observations which l" have been enabled to make upon the
velocity with which earthquake motion is propagated are dependent upon
the accuracy of time observations made at the localities just mentioned
In iokio and Yokohama the observations were usually made automa-
tically, by means of an instrument (which I have described in Vol IV of

^\^                                        Seismological Society of    Japan,' under the name
of a
      '<lT?i.^m░e'^rT^a*'k,e░r'''),,?^w*^h«i.ch gives a record of the   time of a disturbance

without stopping or retarding the clock from which it was taken. At Chiba
and Kumagai the records were taken by telegraph operators by means of
watches which I provided for them. At the remaining stations the
observations were made similarly. All watches and clocks were from
time to time compared with a telegraphic signal sent daily from the
Meteorological Department in Tokio throughout Japan. The only ex-
ceptions wereHakodate and Saporo, where the observations were made
at observatories well  provided
accurate local time.             with   the    necessary means of obtaininc░r

The conclusions which these observations lead me to draw are--
    1. Different earthquakes, although they may travel across the same

district, do so with different velocities, varying between several hundreds
and several thousands of feet per second.

2. The same disturbance is propagated with a decreasing velocity
travelling very much more quickly across districts
                                                                       which  are  near  to  the
origm than across districts which are far removed.

     3. The greater the initial  force  producing a disturbance                    the  ░.Greater

the velocity of propagation.

    As examples of the observations     which  have led to these deductions                  I

quote the lollowing :

1. The earthquake of October 25, 1881.
The origin of this was about 41░ N. lat. and 144░ 15' E. long. From
 208 EEPORT-- 1882.

 tbe Hakodate homoseist this shock travelled at the rate of about
 10,219 feet per second to reach Tokio. Between Tokio and Yokohama
 the rate of propagation appears to have been about 4,500 feet per second.

      2. The earthquake of February 6, and two disturbances on March 1,1881.
      These disturbances, like that of October 25, appear to have travelled
 in a straight line through Tokio and Yokohama. Their velocities of propa-
 gation were respectively about 3,900, 1,900, and 1,400 feet per second.
      3. The earthquake of February 16, 1881.
      This shock appears to have originated in Yedo Bay, about eight miles
 east of Yokohama. From the Yokohama homoseist the velocity with
 which the shock travelled on to Tokio was about 2,454 feet per second.
      4. The earthquake of March 11, 1881.
      This disturbance originated at a place about nineteen miles S.S.W.
from Chiba. The shock was a severe one. From the Tokio homoseist
 it appears to have travelled at the rate of 2,200 feet per second on to
 Yokohama.

     No doubt, notwithstanding the care which has been taken to have
the time observations correctly recorded, it is possible that there may be

 errors due, for instance, to observers or instruments at the different

stations making their records at different portions of the disturbance.

Also there may be differences in the calculated velocities due to differences
in the topographical and geological nature of the districts traversed by

 the disturbance.

     Although causes such as these may lead to a want of accuracy in the

calculations which are here presented, I still regard the results of these

 calculations as indicating general laws. This view appears to be confirmed
by the analysis of a table of earthquake velocities which I have compiled from
the writings of various earthquake investigators, and also from the result of
 experiments on artificially produced disturbances yet to be referred to.

      III. The Kature of EarthqtiaJie Motion.

     myIn first report to this Association I stated, 1st, that although the

 upper portions of buildings may at the time of an earthquake move

through a considerable distance, the actual motion of the ground does not
usually exceed a few millimetres, and is often under one millimetre

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

2nd, the backward and forward motions of the ground are very irregular,
both as regards period and amplitude ; 3rd, that there are seldom more
than two or three vibrations per second ; and 4th, that the motion often
takes place in more than one direction.

     To these observations, which have received further confirmation from

records of earthquakes taken during the past year, I may add that in

certain earthquakes where there are one or more prominent vibrations or
what might be called shocks

      1st. That the motion of the ground imvards towards the origin of the

disturbance is usually much greater than the motion outwards.

     2nd. That the velocity, and consequently the acceleration of an earth

particle for the inward motion, is usually very much greater than for

the outward motion.

   --In certain instances these two characters which are of great import-

ance, not only as indicators of the side from which the disturbance came,

--but also as indicators of the nature of the cause of the disturbance

have sometimes observed, not simply in one or two vibrations of a dis-
turbance, but in nearly all the vibrations which were sufficiently well

defined to be analysed.
       ON THE EAUTIIQUAKE PHENOMENA OF JAPAN.               209

       "Further, it may he added that certain semi-vibrations have been

described by the pointer of the seismograph moving across a movin""

record receiver in the direction of its motion, which have the anomalous

appearance of having- been described in less than no time.

     From these observations it_ would appear that it is hardly safe for us
to regard the backward and forward motion of the earth as simple
harmonic motions, and maximum velocities and accelerations calculated
upon such an assumption may possibly lead to false results.

    TV. An endeavour to find out the relative extent and variation in

direction of the motion of an earthquake at neighbouring points in a given
area, the contour and geological structure of ivhich is irregular.

     To work ont this problem seven similar seismometers were distributed

on the hills and in the valleys near my house. The chief difficulty which

had to be overcome in this investigation was to obtain a type of seismo-

meter which, whilst magnifying the actual motion of the ground, was

sufficiently simple to allow of a number being employed, and which, when
under the same conditions, would give the same result. The results of

experiments to find such an instrument are given in Vol. III. of the

'Transactions of the Seisraological Society.' The seismometers which
were chosen consisted of heavy pendulums suspended in cases to shield
them from currents of air. Against the bobs of these pendulums, in grooves
at right angles to each other, slips of wood were placed. At the time of
an earthquake these, being pushed against the pendulum by the motion
of the stands on which they rested, caused pointers which were attached
to them by one thread of a bifilar suspension to swing round and o-ive a
magnified representation of the motion which had taken place.

     The so-called hills surrounding the plain of Tokio are irregular, flat-
topped spurs, jutting out from an elevated plateau about 100 feet hio-h
into the flat plain on which a great portion of the city of Tokio is situ-
ated. The area over which the seismometers were distributed had a

radius of about a quarter of a mile. Two of the seismometers were

placed on the top of the spurs, two'wex-e placed near together on the side
of a spur, whilst three were placed at diSerent points on the plain.

     The results obtained from the records of fourteen small earthquakes

are :

    1st. That the maximum amplitude of motion and the direction of

motion at all the stations were different.

     2nd. The greatest motion was experienced upon the flat ground, and
the least upon the hills and their flanks.

     These results have been confirmed by observations made with other
instruments. For instance, one of Professor Ewing's bracket seismographs

at the University, situated on the flat ground of Tokio, usually records a

much larger amplitude of motion than seismographs constructed on similar

principles placed at my own house, situated on a small plateau half-way

up the side of a hill about a mile distant from the University. Also the

duration of a distui-bance is longer on the low ground than it is upon the

high ground. As an example, the earthquake of March 11, 1882, may

be quoted. At the University this disturbance lasted about 41- minutes

the maximum amplitude of motion being 8 millimetres; at my "house the

motion could only be traced upon the moving plate on which it was

recorded for a period of about 1^ minute, and the maximum amplitude

was about 3 millimetres. That there is less disturbance npou the hills

than in the plain at Tokio is a fact that has loncg been recooo-nised bJv the
1882.
       p

Japanese. It -was especially remarked at the time of the destructive

earthquake of 1854.
     In Yokohama, sixteen miles to the S.E., -where the high and low

ground has almost exactly the same topographical character as at Tokio,
the rule appears to be reversed. This was clearly evident in February
1880, when the shattering of chimneys, unroofing of houses, and destruc-
tion generally was almost wholly confined to the high ground. In

--Hakodate the rule appears to be like that for Tokio namely, that the

greatest disturbance is felt upon the low ground.
      In consequence of the great difference in motion observed in places

which are adjacent to each other, I have hitherto been unable to make
any satisfactory determination of the manner in which an earthquake
dies out as it radiates from its cpicentrum, although on many occasions I
have obtained a number of diagrams for the same earthquake from

distant stations.
      "V. Experiments on artificially produced Earthquakes.

     In 1881, in conjunction with Mr. Thomas Gray, I made experiments
upon a series of artificial earthquakes produced by allowing a heavy iron
ball to fall from various heights up to 35 feet.

     During the past year I continued these experiments on a larger and
more satisfactory scale, the disturbances being produced by charges of
dynamite exploded in bore-holes usually about 10 feet deep. In the first
two sets of experiments the vibrations resulting from the explosions were
simultaneously recorded upon moving glass plates at three stations.

      In consequence of the great increase in the intensity of the initial
disturbance as compared with that obtained from the falling ball, the result-
ing diagrams showing the backward and forward motions of the ground

were much larger, and, therefore, better fitted for analysis than those

which had been obtained pi-eviously. It also became possible to place
the observation stations at greater distances apart, and thus errors in the
calculation of velocity arising from inaccuracy in time observations were

considerably reduced.

     The results obtained were a confirmation of results which had been
previously obtained. They were, briefly

    A1. graphic separation of normal and transverse vibrations.
   A2. determination of the relative amplitudes and periods of these

vibrations at various points.

     3. The determination of the manner in which these vibrations became

extinguished.

     4. The velocity with which these vibrations were propagated.

   --To these observations the following may be added :

      5. Vibrations, especially those performed in a normal direction, take place
more rapidly near to the commencement of a disturbance than at the end.

     6. The greatest motion of the ground, as shown by the normal vibra-

tions, is inwards towards the origin of the disturbance.
     7. The direction in which the ground moves with the greatest velocity

is also imvards towards the origin of the disturbance.
     8. The motion does not appear to be simple harmonic.
     9. The vertical motion is not due to a direct shock, but to a surface

nndulation.

     10. The velocity of propagation of a disturbance is not constant, but
varies with the distance from the origin.

     The last observation led to three new sets of experiments being

undertaken, the chief object of which was to determine the velocity with
ON TUB EAKTHQTTAK.E PHENOMENA OF JAPAN.  .211

which vibrations of various descriptions were propagated. The arrange-
ments were automatic. The charges were fired electrically, and as the
disturbance passed successive stations electric circuits were broken and a
mark made upon the surface of a smoked glass plate which was moving
at a known rate.

     The results, which have not yet been worked out in detail, are gene-

rally as follows :

     1. The velocity of propagation of both normal and transverse vibra-

tions is a function- of the initial force creating the disturbance ; or,

briefly, the greater the charge of dynamite the greater the velocity.
     2. The velocity of propagation of both normal and transverse vibra-

tions is greater between points near to the origin than between points

which are distant. Near to the origin this velocity decreases much more

rapidly than it does at a distance.

    When writing on this subject, I shall refer to the work done in this

direction by Mr. Robert Mallet and by General Abott.
      VI. Experiments to determine the relative motion of two neighhouring

points of ground.

     In these expei'iments two stakes were driven in the ground at various
distances apart up to about 2 ft. 6 in. ' Sometimes the stakes were so
placed that a continuation of the line joining them passed through the
origin of the disturbance, and sometimes they were placed at right angles
to such a direction. Fixed horizontally upon the head of one of the stakes
was a light rigid bar, from the end of which a light index hung vertically.
This index at a short distance below its point of suspension, which was a
universal joint, was caught by a second universal joint at the end of a bar
passing from the second stake. So long as the two heads of the stakes
synchronised in their motions, it was assumed that the universal joints at
the ends of the bars would keep vertically beneath each other, and the index
which they supported would remain perpendicular. If, however, there
was a want of synchronism, the lower end of the index would give a

multiplied representation of their relative displacements. In all cases it
was found that there was a considerable relative motion in the direction

of the origin.

     The chief practical value of this experiment was to see how far we

are justified in placing two portions of a seismograph upon different

stakes. It also shows that a building, although it may be small, may not
be moved as a whole, but may suffer considerable racking.

      VII. Experiments on the Production of Earth Currents.

     From near the scene of the explosions a telegraphic communication

was established across a deep moat up to a hill where the mechanical'
disturbances were practically not observable. Each end of this circuit
was put to earth by means of two long crow-bars, and in the circuit on
the hill one of Clark's diff'erential galvanometers was arranged. As
either of the crow-bars was raised or depressed it was found that the
current passing through the galvanometer varied, sometimes being positive
and sometimes being negative. At a certain depth, which was found by trial,,
the needle of the galvanometer remained at zero, and it was in this way
that the adjustment to ' no current ' was made previous to an explosion.

    When the explosion took place, one earth bar being at distances of

from 10 to 50 feet, a considerable current was always produced, and the
needle of the galvanometer swung with violence until it reached a stop.
The direction of swing was, in the few experiments which were made,,
--212 REPORT 1882.

always constant. Sometimes the needle remained permanently deflected,
and at otlier times it gradually fell back towards zero.

     These currents I regard as being due to a mechanical disturbance of
one of the earth bar.s, causing a difference of contact with the soil ; and,
in consequence of this, an alteration iu the moisture, oxidation surface,
&c., at one end of the circuit, thus giving rise to a difference of potential
relatively to the other end of the circuit.

    No doubt actual earthquakes act upon the earth plates of telegraphic

lines in a similar manner, but the currents which are in this way pro-
duced at the time of an earthquake are due to different causes than those
which appear sometimes to have preceded earthquakes by considerable

intervals of time.

     In the experiment upon artificial earthquakes ray thanks are especially
due to Mr. T. Fujioka and Mr. M. Kuwabara, of the Imperial College of
Engineering, and not least of all to Mr. John Reid, agent of Nobel and

Co., and to Mr. Denys Larrieu, who not only furnished me -with dyna-
mite, but on several occasions also gave me their personal assistance.

     The great difficulties which had to be overcome in making these
experiments, as, for instance, obtaining dynamite from the Government

stores, its transportation, its storage, the difficulties in obtaining a piece

of ground on which to experiment, manufacturing the necessary instru-
ments, obtaining telegraphic wire and firing apparatus, the making of
electric fuses, the anxiety lest accidents should occur, the training of a

body of assistants, the putting in of bore-holes, the almost unexceptionally
bad weather which had to be encountex'ed on days for which permission
had been obtained, &c., have already been referred to in a letter to this

Association.

      For the use of the ground where the experiments were performed and
for the loan of numerous tents for the places where the instruments were

established, and for a body of attentive servants, my thanks are due to His

Excellency General Yamada, Minister of the Interior, and to Mr. Arai
Ikunosuke, Director of the Meteorological Department. For the loan of

telegraph wire, firing apparatus, and other instruments I tender my

thanks to the directors and officers of the Department of Public Works,

especially the Department of Imperial Telegraphs, the ^aval and War

Departments, and the Imperial College of Bngineei-ing.
      Although several good diagrams of actual earthquake motion were

obtained, in consequence of my instruments being continually removed

for the purpose of making experiments on artificial disturbances, each set
of which took several weeks' prepax'ation, many earthquakes were passed

by unrecorded. Had the instruments, however, been continually in their

places, the records would not have been so numerous as in previous years,

--the last season being comparatively a poor one there only being between

May 1881 and May 1882 fifty-seven shocks, as compared with eighty

 which were felt during the corresponding period of the previous year.
      The greatest activity was in February and March.
      Although earthquake disturbances were comparatively few in the

Tokio area, the records obtained by the help of post-cards from the
districts north of Tokio show that during certain months there was in
North Japan an activity greater than was anticipated. In fact, judging
 from the records which were obtained although the season was a poor
 one, it was calculated that, taking Japan as a whole, there were every
year, on the average, two or three shocks per day, a number as great
as that which is usually assigned for the whole world.

    Through the removal to South Africa of the member of the Committee

taking charge of Staffordshire, this district is still incomplete, but some

information as to the Bui'ton-on-Trent area is given in the first report.

In Devonshire the enquiry was carried on by Mr. Pengelly, F.R.S.,

supplemented by details obtained by Mr. Stooke, C.E. The Triassic rocks

of the district have been made the object of careful study by Mr. W. A. E.

Ussher. From his investigations it would appear that the sequence ex-
hibited has more in common with the Trias of the French side of the

English Channel than with that of the midland counties. In Devonshire

and Somersetshire the sandstones and conglomerates appear to have been

deposited in a distinct basin to that north of the Mendips, the Keuper

marls being alone common to the two districts.

The basin south of the Mendips is remarkable for having a series of

marls intercalated in its sandstones, called by Mr. Ussher the ' Middle

Marls ; these underlie sandstones beneath the Keuper marls. The con-
                                '

glomerates have a distinctly local character, and when present are plenti-

fully water-bearing, as are the sandstones, though to a somewhat less

extent.

Private supplies are obtained by wells at Torqnay, where the water-

level is 168 feet above the sea ; at Teignmoutli ; at Dawlish, -where the
water-level is 71 feet above the sea ; and at Bramford Speke, near Exeter.

     Near Exeter the Lyons Holt spring issues at 126 feet above sea-level,
yielding towards the town supply 47,000 gallons daily of very pure water,
which is extensively used for drinking-fountains.

     The following gives an abstract of the facts, of the more important

wells in the Exeter district :

                       Locality
ON THE CIRCULATION OF UNDERGROUND WATERS.            215

     In reference to the information furnished by Mr. Taunton as to the

Thames and Severn Canal, it may be well to state that the outcrop of the

oolitic rocks has an average breadth on the dip of 25 miles. The base of

the Oolites resting on the Lias reaches its highest point near Chipping

Campden, 1,032 feet above the sea, on the watershed between the Thames

and Severn basins. This, south of the Seven Wells, the source of the

Churn, runs somewhat east of the base of the Oolite, causing the surface

drainage of the oolitic tract around Minchinhampton, Dursley, and

Wotton-under-Edge to flow into the basin of the Severn. It is probable

also that a portion of the underground drainage does so also, notwith-

standing the general south-easterly dip, from the basement level of the

Oolites, varying in the direction of the strike, owing to the denudation

of the escarpment being unequal, the Oolite to the south having been

worn back much further down the dip, and consequently to a lower

elevation than at Chipping Campden, descending from 1,030 at the

latter place to 212 feet in the Stroud valley, or about 800 feet in 25 miles.

South of this valley the level rises slightly, so that a partial discharge of

underground drainage takes place in this valley, which is immediately

west of the point in the Thames and Severn vratershed which is pene-

trated by the canal connecting the two basins.

     Of the 25 miles of average outcrop of oolitic rocks measured on the

--dip, only about 8 consist of impermeable deposits viz., the Fuller's Earth,
--the Oxford Clay, and the Kimmeridge Clay, so that two-thirds of the area

may be considered to be of a permeable character. The vertical section

of the Oolites is as follows :

   --WarwicJcsliire information. The southern and western portion of the

Warwickshire coalfield is overlaid by Permian rocks consisting of reddish-
brown and purple sandstones, intercalated with marls in lenticular beds,
rising to a height of 622 feet at Cowley Hall, which forms part of the
watershed between the tributaries of the Trent to the north, and those of

the Avon on the south.
     Though the surface-drainage of this Permian area flows in opposite

directions, that portion of the rainfall percolating into the ground has a
uniform gradient to the south, the base of the Permians, where they rest
on the coal measures west of Atherstone, being 470 feet above the sea,
and 170 feet under the Mithurst Tunnel of the Midland Railway, being a
fall of 50 feet per mile, while at Warwick the tops of the Permians are
18C feet above the sea, and as they are not less than 800 feet thick, their
base is probably about 600 feet below the sea-level, giving a further fall

of 786 feet in 18 miles, or a fall of 4.3 feet per mile.
     Examining the district more minutely, it is seen that though the

Permians do not always lie conformably on the coal measures, yet
there is a general conformity, and a synclinal flexure traversing the
coal measures from north to south is shared by the overlying Permians,
which have synclinal dips towards the axis of an average amount of 3░,
216        liEPORT 1882.

or about 270 feet per mile from the edges of the basin towards the axis,

which occurs more to the eastern than the western margin.

The fault throwing in the coal measures of Arley "Wood is believed to

be connected with the fault throwing back the outcrop of the main part

of the  coalfield at Broomfield  Park                            but of this there is no evidence, and
                                                              ;

as the dips in the Permian show the flexures to be present on both sides

of the supposed fault, its existence is very doubtful. If it occurred, and

were a watertight barrier, the water percolating into the sandstones to
the west of Atherstone and flowing south would be thrown out in a line

of springs, which is not the case ; and there is no doubt that the waters
travelling in the porous portion of the system flow south to Leamington
and Warwick, where a portion of the supply is utilised. South of this
point the Permians are concealed by triassic, liassic, and oolitic rocks
in the direction of Banbury. Southwards the Permians probably wedge
out before the Trias, which continue into the Thames basin ; the water
travelling down the dip planes of the Permian, where that formation thins
out, probably enters the overlying triassic sands, and, prevented from rising
higher by the Keuper marls, probably flows a considerable distance under
the Thames basin, where its outlet being checked by the thinning out of
the Lower Trias against the Palaeozoic ridge, causes the subterranean
Trias to be fully charged with water in a stationary condition, and thus
limits the amount of absorption in the area of absorption.

     Between the base of the Permian and the Spirorhis limestone is
a thickness of 150 feet, and between it and the first workable coal is a
further 500 feet, of which a large portion consists of Permian sandstone
fully charged with water, which was met with in sinking the Exhall

Colliery.

red sandstone occupies a large area from the western boundary fault of the South
Stafford.shire coalfield to Enville, and forms the gathering ground for this well. It
has few large streams on it, as it is so permeable that the rainfall percolates easily.
There are no large towns on this area, but villages and gentlemen's country seats,
including Enville Hall, Lord Stamford's, and the famous Sheep Walks. The rock is
full of water, which overflows along the banks of the river, and the long overflow
has formed springs or wells in the sandstone escarpment, one of which is called the
' bottomless pit,' from the persistency of the outflow of the water in great volumes
at all seasons uniformly. This company purchased the right to run a heading at
50 ft. below the surface from the Wollaston well under this escarpment to another
site at Tack Farm, half a mile away, but the bore-hole has yielded all that is needed
without any chance of river water getting into the well. The Wollaston site was
that originally chosen for the works, but it was considered that the same condition
would appertain at Mill Jleadow, the site near the town, although no sign of a spring
was then seen. It was found exactly as conjectured, and answered for town supply

for 20 years, and being between the town and reservoir a much less outlay was

sufficient.

Farticulars of a Bore-hole sunh tmder Mr. H. J. Marten's superintendence for

          the Waterworlis belonging to the Corporation of Wolrerhamjyton.

                     By Mr. Henry J. Marten, M. Inst. C.E.

     1. The Bore-hole in question is situate at the Cosford Pumping Station

of the "Wolverhampton Corporation Waterworks, about nine miles distant
from Wolverhampton along the old turnpike road leading from Wolver-
hampton to Shrewsbury, and is sunk through the upper soft red, and the

conglomerate, into the lower soft red measures of the New Red Sandstone

formation.

     la. The boring was commenced in June, 187G, and completed in
December, 1877, and it has not been deepened since.

     2. The approximate height of the present surface of the ground above
mean sea-level is 200 feet.

     3. The total depth of the bore-hole from the present surface of the
ground is 918 feet 9 inches, of which 534 feet is 24 inches in diameter,
and the remainder, 384 feet 9 inches, is 15 inches in diameter.

     The bore-hole is fitted at the top with a cast-iron guard pipe which
rises about 3 feet above the present surface of the ground, with an opening
in it at a depth of 4 feet, and another at between 16 and 17 feet below
the present surface of the ground, through which, by means of sluices,
the water rising up the bore-hole can be turned either into an adjoining
brook or into the engine well.

      3a. There are no horizontal driftways.

    4. When not being drawn upon the water rises in the guard pipe

described in reply to question 3, to a height of about 1 foot above the
present surface of the ground, or 9 feet above the natural, or original,

surface of the ground. At this level, which is denominated the summit

level, the artesian force of the deep springs supplying the bore-hole is
balanced by the head of water attained in the guard pipe, and everything

is at rest. On opening the sluice 5 feet below this point the natural
discharge from the bore-hole is at the rate of 480,000 gallons a day. On

opening the lower sluice in the guard pipe, so as to reduce the outflow
point to the level of the water in the engine well, or 14 feet below summit

level, the natural discharge is at the rate of 830,000 gallons a day. On

pumping down the water in the bore-hole to a depth of 27 feet below
summit level, the yield is at the rate of 1,320,000 gallons a day, and at
31 feet below summit level, it is at the rate of 1,420,000 gallons a day.
On ceasing to pump and shutting the sluices, the water rises in the bore-
hole to summit level in a few minutes.

      4a. Excepting for experimental purposes, the water in the bore-hole

has not been permanently pumped down below the engine well level, and
when not drawn upon the height at which the water now stands is the
 same as when the well was first sunk.

      5. The average discharge at engine well level is between 800,000 and
 900,000 gallons a day, and this quantity is daily pumped from that level.

      6. The level of the water does not appear to vary with the seasons to
       ON THE CIRCULATION OF UNDERGROUND WATERS.                        223

any appreciable extent, and it has not diminislied since the bore-hole was

completed.

     7. The ordinary level is not affected by local rains. The summit level
to which the water rises is about 5 feet above the surface of the water in
the River Worf, a stream which is within a dozen yards of the bore-hole.

     8. The analysis of the water is as under :

The Pebble Beds, it will be seen, are here divided into upper and

lower beds by a thick bed of argillaceous marl. The lower pebble

bed was of so obdurate a character that 2,000 blows with a heavy cutter

weighing nearly one ton, and falling 5 feet each stroke, only penetrated

one foot through it.

9a. The principal springs intercepted were in the upper soft red

rocks. There is generally a large flow from the springs in the lower

soft red rocks, but in this case the artesian force at command at the

engine well level was not sufHcient to liberate them to any appreciable

extent. The object ia view in opening a communication through the

argillaceous marl and conglomerate beds into the lower soft red rocks

was to ensure a supply from the last-named beds in the event of the

engine well being lowered, a work now being carried out.               TZ^'''"''^

10 and 11. There is no drift rock over the site of the bore-hole,

12. There are no large faults in the neighbourhood of the bore-hole.

The borehole is situate in the central portion of the downfall trough

--between the Shropshire and Staffordshire coalfields the boundary

faults of which are respectively eight and nine miles from the bore-hole.

13. There was a very slight briny ooze, estimated at about 300 gallons

a day, from the argillaceous marl beds into the bore-hole.

14. There are no salt springs in the neighbourhood.

15. No wells or borings have been discontinued in the neighbourhood

in consequence of the water being more or less brackish.

16. The bore-hole required no casing in it from top to bottom. The

bore-hole, which was sunk by rope-boring machinery, supplied by Messrs.

Particulars of WaterworJcs Well sunk under superintendence of Mr. Henry
     J. Marten, M. Inst. C.E., for the supply of Tamworth and the sur-

      rounding district with water.

     1. The well is situate at Hopwas, about 2 miles to the west of Tam-

worth, and is sunk in the conglomerate beds of the New Red Sandstone

formation.

     la. The well was sunk in the year 1879, and has not been deepened

by sinking or boring since that date.
     2. The approximate height of the surface of the ground is 306 feet

above Ordnance datum.
     3. The depth from the surface of the ground to the bottom of the

well which is 10 feet in diameter, is 168 feet, and there is no bore-hole.
      3a. There are no horizontal drifts.
     4. Before pumping, the water stood at 1 29 feet below the surface of

the ground. The number of hours elapsing before ordinary level is
restored depends upon the extent and duration of the pumping.

     4a. The well was sunk practically di-y, until a depth of 168 feet below
the surface of the ground was reached, when, through the marl floor of
the well at that depth a large spring was met with, the initial inflow of
which was at the rate of about 1,500,000 gallons a day, and its artesian
force such that in a veiy few minutes it rose to a height of 39 feet above
the bottom of the well, or, as before stated, to 129 feet from the surface
of the oTOund, at which point it remained stationary, and to which point
it rises when not drawn upon by pumping.

      5. Durino- an experimental test extending over a period of 59 days,

from September 21 to November 19, 1881 , the pumps were kept continu-
ously at work day and night, and during that time the total quantity of
water raised from the well was 61,000,000 gallons, or rather over
1 000 000 callous a day. This continuous pumping at the i-ate named

lowered the water in the well 28 feet 7 inches, or to a depth of 157 feet
7 inches below the surface of the ground, leaving a depth of 10 feet

5 inches in the well. On the cessation of pumping the water rose

8 inches in 30 seconds, or at the rate of 945,000 gallons a day, and at
the end of 8 days it had regained 14 feet 2 inches of the loss of level. In
3 weeks (notwithstanding occasional pumping for the supply of about
800 houses then laid on), it had risen to a level some few inches higher
than the point at which it stood before the experimental test was made.
The averao'e quantity pumped for the supply at present of between 1,100
and 1,200 houses is about 55,000 gallons jjer diem.

      6. There is no decided information available as to whether the water-

level varies with the seasons. I am of opinion that it does, though only

to a limited extent. The well having only been regularly drawn upon for
water supply purposes for less than a year, and that at a rate very far
within the margin of its average yield, affords no experience at the
present time on the point whether the yield is diminishing or not.

      7. The ordinary water-level is not affected by local rains. It stands
       ON THE CIRCULATION OF UNDERGROUND WATERS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          225

about 177 feet above mean sea-level, or 11 feet above the ordinary-
summer level of the river Tame, about half a mile distant.

9a. As stated in reply to 4a, the well was practically dry until the

spring referred to was tapped, at a depth of 168 feet from the surface

though a little water oozed out at the bottom of the fissured sandstone

rock ' jf ' in the preceding answer.

A singular phenomenon occurred with respect to one of the fis-

sures situate in this rock at 115 feet from the surface of the ground.

When first opened down to, a violent current of wind (simply atmo-

spheric air) rushed from it, which gradually spent itself, and was fol-

lowed thereafter at one time by an in-draught, succeeded at another by
an out-draught. It was observed that these variations of direction were

--coincident with barometrical changes i.e. when the barometer was rising

there was a decided indraught from the well into the fissure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      and, on the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

contrary, while the barometer was sinking there was a decided out-
draught from the fissure into the well. It is evident, therefore, that the
fissure must be connected with large cavernous passages. Changes in

the weather were accurately foretold by watching the behaviour of a

candle-flame when placed near the fissure ; but the workmen were dis-
inclined to place much faith in its indications until an active outflow

during the whole of one day was succeeded at night by one of the most

violent storms of the period.

     10. The cover-drift over the rocks contains no sprino-s.

     11. There are no land springs to keep out of the well.

     12. There is a large down-throw fault between the well and the river
Tame, which brings the Keuper Marl beds face to face with the con-
glomerate beds in which the well is sunk.

    13. No brine springs were passed through in making the well.

     14. There are no salt springs in the locality.

    15. No wells or borings in the neighbourhood have been discontinued

in consequence of the water being more or less brackish.

the bottom. Its cost was 793Z. 15s. 6d.

     The microscopic examination of the sediment shows mineral grit
and sand, some crystalline particles, probably carbonate of lime, a little
mycelium of fungi, but no trace of animal or vegetable life.

      This water is quite unfit for a water-supply on account of the large
quantity of lime, magnesia, and sulphuric acid. Perhaps if the borings
were continued farther a softer water might be obtained.

     Attention is called to the case of the Clifton Asylum Well, where the
solids are now only about 20 grains, whereas I believe that previous to
deepening the water was too hard to use.

                               The Porosikj and Density of Rocks.

    My first object in commenciug a series of observations on the porosity

of rocks was with a view of investigating the lithological changes which
        ON THE CIRCULATION OF UNDERGROUND WATERS.  231

are brought about by tbe percolation of water through them. But while

engaged in work of this kind, one is struck with the great volume of

water which the rocks of the earth are capable of absorbing, and a know-

ledge of this is important both as regards water-supply and the suit-

ability of stone for building purposes. Much information on the subject

has already been obtained by the investigations of the Rivers Pollution

Commission, the Commission on "Water Supply, and on the Selection and

Decay of Stone for the Houses of Pai'liament. Also by the Committee

appointed by the British Association for the Investigation of the Circula-

tion of Underground Waters, and by Mr. De Ranee, C.E., F.Gr.S., in his

book on the Water Supply of England and Wales.

The method which I have adopted for arriving at the results con-

tained in this paper is that recommended by Dr. Sterry Hunt in the

Geological and Chemical Essays. ^ The portions of rock selected for the
work were struck off by a blow with a hammer. By this means I was

enabled to get clear and natural surfaces exposed. The whole of the

--results obtained are given in the annexed table.
     The Arenaceous JRochs. The oldest rocks which I have examined are

those of the Old Red, and all the specimens were selected personally.

Taking first the Old Red Sandstone we get an average specific gravity

of 2"61, but the specimens from near Bristol have a decidedly lower

specific gravity compared with others which are given. Excluding the flags

from Caithness, the volume of water absorbed by a cubic foot of the rock

is 0-707 of a gallon, or 59,000,000 gallons to the square mile 3 feet thick.

The specimen of flags from Caithness absorbed much less Avater, and I

found the same thing to apply to Old Red flagstones from other districts.
The conglomerate beds are more absorbent than the sandstones : the

average specific gravity is 2-58 and the volume of water absorbed by a

cubic foot 0-805 of a gallon, or 67,000,000 gallons to a square mile .3 feet

thick.

I next take the Millstone Grit. The specimens from Bristol, South

Wales, and the Forest of Dean were selected personally, and for those

from Sheffield I am indebted to the kindness of Dr. Sorby, P.R.S. The

Millstone Grit which underlies the Bristol coalfield is something like

1,000 feet thick ^; the chemical composition, the mean of five analyses,

is as follows :

        Silica            97-80
                              '47

     In some of the specimens of this grit, microscopically examined, the
grains of silica appear to cement themselves together, and so closely,
that it is difficult to distinguish their outline. The gi-ains are, for the
most part, sub-angular, and are either colourless or have a slight pink
tinge imparted by oxide of iron. The specific gravity averages 2-60,
and the amount of water absorbed by a cubic foot of the rock is O'OSO of

a gallon, equal to 6,000,000 gallons to a square mile 3 feet thick.

Two typical specimens of Millstoue Grrit were selected from Pertyrcb,

South  Wales                                one a coarse variety and             the  other  with  grains             averaging
                                         ;

about O'OIO of an inch in diameter. There is a slight lithological differ-

ence when compared with the same formation around Bristol, and

chemically it is a little more argillaceous, as shown by the following

analysis :

The specific gravity may be taken at 2^57, the volume of water

capable of being absorbed by a cubic foot of the rock 0-290 of a gallon,

or 23,000,000 gallons to a square mile 3 feet thick.

The specimens of Millstone Grit from Sheffield resemble lithologically

those of South Wales, though a person acquainted with the formations

in the two districts would probably be able to distinguish between them.

The grains composing the grit in the neighbourhood of ShefiBeld,

according to Dr. Sorby, 'are, on the whole, extremely angular.' ' The

specific gravity averages 2'59, and the volume of water absorbed per

cubic foot of rock is 0-504 of a gallon, equal to 42,000,000 gallons to a

square mile 3 feet thick.

    Two samples of Millstone Grit were collected from the Forest of

Dean   coalfield                                       one  from  the  southern  outcrop and  the  other              from  the

pared with the same formation at Bristol and in South Wales, and a

very much larger volume of water is absorbed. The rock resembles a

Trias sandstone more than the Millstone Grit, but in chemical com-

position there is practically little difference, as is shown by the following

analysis of a specimen from Drybrook :

            Silica                                                                                         98-06

     The specific gravity of tlie Forest of Dean Millstone Grit averages
2-63, the volume of water absorbed by a cubic foot of the rock is 0854 of
a gallon, or 71,000,000 gallons to a square mile 3 feet thick. Though I
have given the average volume of water absorbed, it will be seen, on
reference to the tabulated list, that the results obtained from the two
specimens examined differ considerably. In the case of the one absorb-

ing the greatest quantity of water, the grains composing it were but
slightly cohesive, but in the other case the rock was of a more compact

character.

ON THE CIRCULATION OF UNDERGROUND WATERS.  233

      Referring to the upland surface water from the Millstone Grit and
the non-calcareous portions of the coal measures, the Royal Com-

missioners on Rivers Pollution say in their sixth report,' ' Many of the

larsre manufacturing towns of Lancashire and Yorkshire are supplied
with water for potable and manufacturing purposes, by the storage in
vast reservoirs of the upland drainage from these formations. Being
but slightly absorbent they yield to the impounding rivulets and streams
a large proportion of the actual rainfall.' Though the Millstone Grit

may be but slightly absorbent in the localities named, yet this character

cannot be established as a rule by which one can be guided. In the case
of the Bristol coalfield it applies, but when we come to the Forest of

Dean we find the reverse to be the case. The Millstone Grit of the West
of England serves as a good illustration of the variability of rocks in
different localities, especially as regards the volume of water which is

capable of being stored in them.

     The next rocks examined were those of the Pennant Grit. It is
necessary here to lay stress upon the definite article, as ' the Pennant ' is
confined to the middle coal-measui-es of Bristol, and is also extensively
developed in the Somersetshire and South Wales coalfields. There are,
however, beds of grit in the lower coal-measures of Bristol, which are
lithologically true Pennants. The Pennant Grit is a compact blue rock,
made up of angular grains. The following is the mean analysis of seven

samples taken from my paper on the ' Composition of the Pennant Gi-it.' ^

                        99-96

     The specific gravity of the Pennant averages 2'67, the water absorbed
by a cubic foot of the rock 0"150 of a gallon, and by a square mile 3 feet
thick 12,000,000 gallons. Speaking of deep wells in the Coal Meastires,
the Rivers Pollution Commissioners say : ^ The proportion of mineral
impurity present in the deep well-water is always large, but varies within
wide limits. The water was found to contain, ' as a rule, larger pro-
portions of organic elements (organic carbon and organic nitrogen) than
are met with in similar waters obtained from other strata,' the average

proportion being 0'153 parts per 100,000 parts, or 'lO? grains per gallon,

I quite endorse what the Commissioners say in respect to water from

the coal-measures generally, but where we have a great thickness of

rock, as in the case of the Pennant around Bristol and Swansea, I think

there may be an exception to what has been stated. Some years ago,

it was proposed to supply a portion of Bristol with water from the
Frampton Cottrell iron mines, which are in the Pennant, and the
analyses made of the water showed it to be of good quality. Considering
the quantity of water which this rock is capable of storing, the quality

                                ' Page 40, part 2.

becomes a matter of great importance to villages and towns in the

vicinity.

     The only specimen of Triassic sandstone which I have had an oppor-
tunity of examining is that of the Banter, from Heidelberg, Germany.
The specific gravity was 2'55, and the volume of water absoi-bed by a
cubic foot of the rock was 0'838 of a gallon, equal to 70,000,000 gallons to
a square mile 3 feet thick. Mr. I. Roberts, F.G.S.,' has made observations
on the porosity of the Bunter from the Pebble Bed of Everton, and found

the absorption to be 0"733 of a gallon of water to the cubic foot of rock.

   --The Calcareous Rocks. Coming to the calcareous rocks which I have

examined, I have classed among them the Magnesian Conglomerate,
which I take first. The average specific gravity is 2 '73, and the volume
of water absorbed by a cubic foot of rock varies between 0"082 and
0-368 of a gallon, or between 6,000,000 and 30,000,000 gallons to a square

mile 3 feet thick. This rock is extensively used for building purposes,
and a knowledge as to the porosity of the various beds is therefore
important in this respect as well as for water supply. It would appear
from the specimens which I have examined, that the finer the conglo-

merate the more water there is absorbed.
     Of the Magnesian Limestone, two specimens were examined, both

selected from the same locality. The average mean specific gravity is
2'77, the water absorbed by a cubic foot of the rock 1'031 gallons, and by

a square mile 3 feet thick, 86,000,000 gallons.

     The Magnesian Limestone is much more porous than the Carboniferous

Limestone, which I take next. All the specimens were obtained per-
sonally, the first three from the lower shales. These gave a specific
gravity of 2' 71, with a porosity of 0'028 of a gallon of water to a cubic
foot of rock, which is equal to 2,000,000 gallons to a square mile. The
specific gravity of the specimens representing the limestone gave an
average of 2'70. The volume of water absorbed by a cubic foot was '043

of a gallon, or 3^ million gallons to a square mile 3 feet thick. From

these comparisons it would seem that the lower shales are least porous.
Considering the large volume of water which these rocks supply, their
not being porous will seem contradictory ; the fact is, however, that the
water finds its way through joints and fissiires, dissolving away the lime-
stone, and sometimes forming subterranean reservoirs.

    We next come to rocks which are very pervious ; some of them, so far

as their absorption of water is concerned, may be compared to an ordinary
sponge. The rocks to which 1 allude are those of the Oolites. The

specimens of the Great Oolite were personally selected from near Bath.
The average specific gravity is 2'52, the water absorbed by a cubic foot
of rock 1'706 of a gallon, or 142,000,000 gallons to a square mile 3 feet
thick. The soft variety is the most absorbent. The specimens of Inferior
 Oolite were personally selected from near Cheltenham, with the exception

of one from near Bath. As this rock is so extensively used for building

and on account of the great volume of water which the beds contain, I
have examined a number of representative specimens, but the variation
in the porosity is so great that no reliable average can be given of the
volume of water capable of being absorbed. The bed which absorbed
 the least was a hard variety of Oolite taken from below the Pisolite bed
 of Leckhampton Hill, near Cheltenham ; and the bed which absorbed the
 most was a soft variety of freestone from the same locality, but higher

                    ' Fourth Report Underground Water Committee, page 16.
ON THE CIRCDLATION OF UNDERGROUND WATERS,                       235

up in the series. The first of these gave 0"146 of a gallon to the cubic

foot, or 13,000,000 gallons to the square mile 3 feet thick ; and the second

2'202 gallons to the cubic foot, or 184,000,000 gallons to a square mile

We3 feet thick.  may, therefore, take it that the yield of water from

the Inferior Oolite varies between those limits.

   --The Relation of Specific Gravity to Porosity. In the report on Selec-

tion and Decay of Stone of the Houses of Parliament in 1839 ^ it is said

that the specimens of rock which had the greatest specific gravity absorb

the least quantity of water, though there are individual exceptions. I

cannot say that my observations bear out this rule, and I doubt whether

any such rule can be laid down.

   --The Relation of the Size of Grains composing a Rock to the Porosity.

In the tabulated results I have given a column in which the size of the

grains composing the rocks is given. The object of this was to ascer-

tain whether any relation existed between the size of the grains and the

porosity. In the sandstones and grits there appears to be no connection

whatever, hut in the Magnesian Conglomerate the finer the material of

which a bed is made up the more water there seems to be absorbed.

In the case of the Oolites the more compact the rock the less porous ib

becomes.

  --The Privity of the Water. On account of shallow well-water being

almost invariably contaminated with organic matter, the Royal Commis-

sioners on Rivers Pollution have classed shallow well-water as dangerous.

On the other hand, deep well-water is classed as wholesome. It is, there-

fore, clear, that if shallow well-water is dangerous and deep well-water

wholesome, there must be a purifying process going on during the

percolation of water through the strata. I have given the analyses of

samples of Millstone Grit and of the Pennant Grit, and on an examination

of these it will be seen that the grits are pi-actically composed of grains of

silica. There is, therefore, nothing in the chemical composition of the

rock which could purify the water except mechanically, and in order

Weto get rid of organic contamination there mast be oxidation.  must,

therefore, look to another source than the chemical composition of the rock

for the oxidising agent, and I think it will be found in the air absorbed

by the water and in the air contained by the rock. The water in the

strata is constantly being drained by springs, wells, and outlets by which

the water-level is reduced. During a dry period, then, the interstices

of the upper portions of porous rocks must be either occupied by air or

there must be a vacuum. The former of these two conditions is the most

probable, and it seems reasonable to assume that the oxygen of this air

must oxidise any organic matter contained in water percolating through

the earth. I have made observations with a view of ascertaining the

volume of air absorbed by certain rocks. I have endeavoured to arrive at

the result by displacing the air contained in given specimens by water. I

have found the volume of water absorbed, and reduced it to the weight of

air, assuming that water at 62░ F. is 819'4 times heavier than air at the

same temperature. By this means I find that a cubic foot of Inferior

Oolite, absorbing 1 gallon of water, would, in the event of complete

drainage off of the water, absorb 0'16 of its volume of air. In short, we

find in the rocks of the earth much the same process going on naturally

as the London water companies are doing artificially for the filtration of

                 > Page 36.

' "'The rate of filtration is 2 gallons per hour.'* By comparing the

chemical analysis of the filter-bed with those of the Millstone Grit and of
the Pennant Grit, it will be seen that to all practical purposes the analyses
are the same. There is nothing in the chemical composition of the filter
which can oxidise the organic impurities of the Thames water passing
through, but the oxidation is effected by air between the gi-ains of sand

with perfect effect. It is much the same with water percolating through

the rocks of the earth ; it comes in contact with air collected in the
interstices. With such rocks as the Mountain Limestone, however, where
the water yielded comes through fissures and joints in the strata, and does
not percolate, it is a question whether the purifying process would be

always satisfactory.

Re'port of the Committee, consisting of Dr. H. C. Sorby, Professor

   W. Eamsay, and Professor W. J. Sollas, appointed for the pur-

   pose of investigating the Conditions under which ordinary Sedi-

   mentary Materials may he converted into Metamorphic Rocks.
   Drawn up by Professor W. J. Sollas {8ecretary\

The Committee have entered upon this investigation by commencing a

.study of the effect of highly-elevated temperatures and pressures on the

solubility of minerals and chemical compounds ordinarily insoluble in water.

They have succeeded in obtaining a simply constructed tube, in which

the experimental substances can be heated in the presence of water to a

high degree of temperature (300-400░ C.) without the escape of steam.

The tube consists of cast iron, is 4 in. long, with an internal diameter of

5 in., and walls | in. thick ; the mouth is closed by a conical iron stopper

ground to fit, and  secured  by screws  and                                                                                                                       nuts to a marginal  flange                               to

metal, is introduced before screwing up.

Silica is the first substance which has been selected for examination,

and the experiments with it have only recently been taken in hand. They

have been conducted by Mr. Hunter, under the supervision of Professor

Ramsay, in the laboratory of University College, Bristol.

    A(1) fragment of colourless, transparent quartz was reduced to fine

powder, placed in a cage of platinum wire gauze, and so introduced into

the tube, along with 10 cubic centimetres of water. The tube was then

closed, and heated by a Bunsen's burner to a temperature of 300░ C. for

two days.  There was no sign of action                                                                                                                            no residue was left on  evapora-

tion of the water, and the surface of the quartz retained its lustre.

(2) Some powdered chalcedony taken from a clear hyaline specimen

was similarly treated. It was slightly attacked, and on evaporation a

distinct residue was left.

     (3) Some chemically pure silica was next prepared by precipitation

from sodium silicate with hydrochloric acid, evaporation to dryness,

thorough washing, and subsequent ignition. After ignition it was placed

in the experimental tube, and heated to 300░ C. for two days. At the

conclusion of the experiment the impalpable powder of silica was found

to have caked together into a white opaque granular mass. On examina-

tion tinder the microscope it was found to have passed into a state of
glass. The glass itf.elf is transparent and colourless, and hard enough to
scratch ordinary window-glass ; it is, however, filled with innumerable
oval and tubular cavities, so as to resemble pumice, and it is to these
that it owes its whiteness and opacity when seen by the unassisted eye.
It is now in process of chemical examination.

      It is proposed to continue these experiments on silica, particularly

under much higher temperatures than those hitherto employed, and to

extend them to other substances.

Report of the Committee, consisting of the late Professor A. Leith

  Adams, Professor W. Boyd Dawkins, Dr. John Evans, Mr. Gr. H.
   KiNAHAN, and Mr. K. J. Ussher {Secretary), appointed for the

  purpose of carrying out Explorations in Caves of Carboniferous
   Limestone in the South of Ireland.

"Within the past three months attempts have been made to effect an

entrance from the face of the scarp into the series of caves discovered and

reported on last year (1881) in the rock called the Carrigmurrish, but

after a careful survey had been made, and levels taken from the several

branches of the caves by Mr. DufEn, County Surveyor (whose kind assist-

ance we wish specially to acknowledge), it was found that the caves lay
at so low a level as to make such a mode of access to them practically

impossible. The onlj' enti-ance to them continues to be by the difhcult

Adescent within the rath on the top of the rock.  series of trial pits

were then sunk with candle-light in the several branches of the caves.

Beneath the stalagmite floor was iu all cases a deep layer of tenacious

clay, passing into gravel when the pits were sunk to the depth of about

six feet. No animal remains nor other relics occurred in these trial pits.

It is therefore probable that the only objects of interest that will be

yielded by excavations on the Carrigmurrish will be found in the kitchen-

midden of the rath, much of which remains untouched.
     Our next operations were conducted in the Bone cave of Ballyna-

mintra, which yielded remains of man associated with those of Irish elk

and bear in 1879, as reported in the ' Proceedings of the Royal Irish.

Academy for 1880,' and more fully in the ' Transactions of the Royal

Dublin Society for 1881.'

    In this cave a new chamber was cleared out down to the level of the

stalagmite floor, and a portion of the latter was broken up, but as yet with-

out result. Beyond this chamber, however, a new series of chambers,

were discovered in which no excavations have been made.

     Excavations have therefore been carried on during the past season
only to a very limited extent, owing to unusual demands on time and

labour for other purposes. The amount expended in wages, &c., is but

two pounds.

     The ossiferous caverns in the county of Waterford have not, however,
been exhausted. The Shandon Cave, which yielded so many fossil
   ON THE PREPARATION OF A GEOLOGICAL MAP OF EUROPE. 241

   remains of mammoth, bear, horse, reindeer, and other animals, remains ia

   great part unexplored since the excavations of our late lamented friend

   Professor A. Leith Adams in 1875. He was then prevented from prose-

   cuting his work further by the danger of the impending roof coming away

   in fragments, the rock being full of horizontal splits, so that layers of

   stone are ready to fall if disturbed from beneath. Professor Leith Adams

   was anxious to resume the exploration of this great cavern, which has

   been so fruitful in Pleistocene mammalia, and stated it as his opinion that

   the superincumbent rock should first be wholly removed for a distance of

   fifty feet along the face of the cliff, taking the present mouth of the cave

   as the centre, and as far in as Cullen's Chamber might extend. The cliff

   is over twenty feet in height, so that such an undertaking would involve

   considerable outlay, including compensation to the occupier of the ground.

   If, however, your Committee could undertake to have the work quarried

   at sixpence a cartload, the stone thus obtained might be sufficient recom-

   Apense for the injury to land and fences.  very large quantity of stone

   would have to be removed, which could be done during the winter

   months, leaving the floor of the cavern open for excavation before next

   summer. It is difficult to estimate the probable expenses of this work.

   To do it effectively the cave should be properly opened up by the total

   removal of its roof. Professor Leith Adams expended 401. on the portion

   that he excavated in 1875, without having to remove any of the roof, as

   Ahis operations were conducted near the mouth.  sum of 50Z. seems to

   be required for the work now proposed.

   Report of the Committee, consisting of Sir A. C. Ramsay, Professor

      J. Prestwich, Professor T. McK. Hughes, and Mr. W. Topley,

      appointed to assist in the preparation of an International

     Geological Map of Europe. Drawn up hy Mr. W. Topley

       {SecretaryX

   Since the appointment of the Committee last year considerable progress

   has been made with the Geological Map of Europe. The International
   Geological Congress met at Bologna on September 26 last. Two

   members of this Committee, Professor Hughes and the Secretary,

   attended the meeting. The discussions extended over five days, but it is

   only with those immediately referring to the Map that this Committee is

   concerned.

       The Congress resolved to prepare and publish a Geological Map of

   Europe, with so much of Asia and Africa as comes within the border

   the map to be published at Berlin on the scale of 1 : 1,500,000 (about

   A23 miles to the inch).  Committee to carry out the work was appointed

   as follows :

       MM. Beyrich and Hauchecorne for Germany (Directors of the Map).

   M. Daubree for France.
   M. De Moeller for Russia.

   M. Giordano for Italy.

    M. Mojsisovics for Austria-Hungary.

    Mr. Topley for England.

    M. Renevier, as Secretary of the Original Committee on Map Colour-

    ing.

    The details of the execution of the map were left to the Committee, as

also were some questions relating to colouring. The Congress, however,
decided upon the following colours :

    Rose carmine for crystalline schists, whenever there is no certain

proof that they are of Cambrian or Post- Cambrian age.

    Bright rose colour for rocks of Pre-Cambrian age.

    Pale rose colour for crystalline rocks of indeterminate age.

    Violet for Trias.

    Blue for Jurassic (the Lias a darker tint.)

    Green for Cretaceous.

    Yellow for Tertiary, the higher beds being the lighter shades.
    The subdivisions of a system are to be represented by shades of the

colour adopted, the darker shade representing the older subdivision.

Divisions may also be shown by reserved spaces of white or by lines.
     The lettering for sedimentary rocks to be based on the Latin alphabet -

for eruptive rocks on the Greek alphabet.

    The monogram of a system to be formed by the initial capital of the

name of the system ; subdivisions to be denoted by the initial small

letter of its name in addition to that of the system. Smaller divisions to

--be denoted by figures, one denoting the oldest example : Silurian, S

Ludlow,  SI                                        Upper Ludlow,   &\
                     ;

    The use of palteontological, orographical, chronological, petro graphi-

cal, and geotechnical signs is recommended.

  --The arrangements finally made for the publication of the map are as

follows : Reimer and Co., of Berlin, are the publishers. The map will

be issued in forty-nine sheets (7 by 7) ; the size of the entire map when

joined together will be rather over 12 ft. by 10 ft. The British Isles are

contained witliin two sheets, with a slight extension of the south-west of

Ireland beyond the map-margin. The southern sheet contains a large

part of the north and north-west of France.

    The cost of engi'aving and colouring the map, including the prepara-

tion of 1,000 complete copies, is estimated at 4,000Z. To meet this expense

contributions will be given by the various Governments of Europe.

England's share of the expense is 400Z., for which 100 copies of the com-

plete map will be given. The Royal Society has voted the first instal-

ment of 751. from the Government grant ; and has also given 75Z. towards

the cost of preparing the map in England so as to be ready for engraving,

and of printing the reports of the various sub-committees on Geological

Nomenclatui'e, &c.

    England is also to supply the requisite information for the topography

and geology of Palestine.

    The engraving of the map is well advanced. Streams and railways

are given in great detail ; the names of places of geological interest will

be  inserted                                       also the names  of the  mountain  chains  and  the  heights  of

ON THE ERRATIC BLOCKS OF ENGLAND, WALES, AND IRELAND. 243

Tenth Report of the GoTnmittee, consisting of Professor J. Prest-

  wiCH, Professor T. McK. Hughes, Professor W. Boyd Dawkins,

   Professor T. Gr. Bonney, Dr. Crosskey, Dr. Deane, and Messrs.

   C. E. De Eance, D. Mackintosh, K. H. Tiddeman, J. E, Lee,
  James Plant, W. Pengelly, H. Gr. Fordham, and W. Terrill,

   appointed for the purpose of recording the position, height

   above the sea, lithological character's, size, and origin of the
   Erratic Blocks of England, Wales, and Ireland, reporting other
   matters of interest connected with the same, and taking measures

  for their preservation. Drawn up by Dr. Crosskey, Secretary.

The Committee liave received the following accounts of Erratic Blocks

examined during the past year :

   --Yorkshire. Mr. "Woodall has examined a number of boulders brought

from the bottom of the JN^orth Sea north of Flamborough Head, and gives

the following account of their position and character :

North of Flamborough Head large numbers of boulders are found

strewing the bottom of the North  Sea                     but they are arranged very much
                                                       ;

in a belt, which is approximately parallel to the existing coast, at a

distance of twenty to forty miles from the land. The outer or eastern

edge of this belt is not well defined ; but on the western side it would
appear to have a sharper boundary, as the marks used by the trawlers

to avoid the boulders show that the line is well marked.

While preserving a line parallel to the existing coast, it is curious to

note that just opposite to the mouth of the Tees the inner edge of the

--' rough ground ' by which name this belt is known to the fishermen

makes a sharp bend to the eastward, coinciding almost exactly with

a line drawn down the Tees Valley. I venture to suggest that this

large belt of erratic blocks is connected with the history of the giant

glacier which descended the Tees Valley, bringing, among other stones,

masses of the well-known Shap Fell granite. The boulders that I have

-- --seen brought on shore having been trawled up by the smacks are

either of Shap granite or carboniferous limestone, and of these I have

--examined from sixty to seventy specimens. The rough ground as far as

--I am aware extends from the coast of Northumberland to the mouth of

the Humber. While the boulder clay on the coast line contains blocks

--of carboniferous limestone and Shap granite, the glacial deposits in the

valley of the Rye and Derwent south of the Cleveland Moor district

и^are composed of oolitic and liassic detritus, and are very different

from those on the coast, though only a few miles distant from each

other.

--AWarwickshire.  remarkable group of erratic blocks has been ex-

posed in some excavations made for building purposes in Icknield Street,

Birmingham, between Key Hill and Hockley Hill. The section occurs

on the N.W. slope of the hill on which it is exposed, and consists of

7 feet or 8 feet of glacial drift (the height slightly varying at different

points), which immediately rests on an irregular and broken surface of

the new red sandstone of the district, and is composed of about 1 foot

6 inches of surface soil. The ' drift ' itself consists of erratic blocks,,

intermixed with nnmeroas round and oval stones and pebbles, together with

small gravel, sand, and clay. In different parts of the section these

materials occur in varying proportions, a light clay generally pre-

dominating. The erratic blocks, however, so pervade the whole bed,

and so thoroughly constitute a component part of it, that tjjey cannot

have been dropped into it either singly or by twos and threes. They

must all have travelled together, for a certain distance at any rate, and
have been brought down together to the spot at which they are found.

They consist of

Fel sites.

Felspathic ashes.

Shales and flagstones.

Quartz conglomerates.

Fragments of quartzite.

Millstone grits (with Stigmaria).

     Fossiliferous calcareous sandstones of Llandovery age.
     The felsites and the felspathic ashes are the most abundant, and the

Llandovery sandstones are the rarest. No granite has been found in

this gi'oup of erratics.

The sizes of the blocks vary. The measurements of a few of the

largest are as follows :

20 in. X 20 in. x 8 in.                                                                                                            26 in. x 15 in. x 14 iu.;  28 in. X 29 in.
                                                                                                                                ;

X 10 in. ; 32 in. x 18 in. x 16 in.

Some are subangular ; a not inconsiderable proportion are well

smoothed, although they can hardly be said to be highly polished and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

on a few striae may be traced.

     Professor C. Lapworth has examined the specimens, and recognises a

mlarge number as being of rocks that occur situ at the Berwyn Hills
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

others may be found in the Arenig range.

    The condition of the new red sandstone rock on which the boulders

rest is most remarkable. The sandstone rock is broken up ; and large

fragments of it have been lifted up out of their position and thrust into

the middle of the drift. At one point in the section a part of the rock

has been lifted up almost like an arm, and still remains united with the

Abasement mass, while the drift fills the V-shaped hollow.                                                                                                    lai-ge erratic

block is seen close to the extreme end of the uplifted arm of the basement

rock.

The evidence of violence is complete. The breaking up of the sand-

stone rock, the uplifting of parts of it en masse, and the carrying away

of fragments, are facts as patent as the presence of the erratic blocks

themselves.

The Secretary of the Committee has had photographs of the section

prepared, to be preserved with specimens of the erratic blocks found.

    The Rev. W. Tuckwell has called the attention of the Committee to

some very interesting boulders at Stockton, near Rugby, about equi-
distant from Leamington, Rugby, and Coventry. The dimensions of the

largest boulder are 4 ft. x 2 ft. 4 in. x 2 ft. 2 in. It is in part angular,
but some portions are rounded. One end is planed into two level

slabs. No distinct striations can be traced. The direction of its longest

axis is almost exactly N. and S. It is composed of granite from Mount

Sorrel, Leicestershire. It is quite isolated, and rests upon the lower
middle lias clay. Its height above the sea is 289 feet. Through the

efforts of Mr. Tackwell, measures have been taken for the pre-

servation of this remarkable boulder. It has been moved from the

roadside, where it was in great danger of being injured, placed upon a

bed of concrete, and will be protected by railings.

   A second boulder, also composed of Mount Sorrel granite, has been

dug up from 5 feet below the surface in Nelson & Co.'s lime- works,

half a mile to the N. of the boulder just described.

Its dimensions are 1 ft. 8 in. x 1 ft. 8 in. x 1 in.

In the same lime-works, and at about the same depth, a boulder

of quartzite has also been Ibund.

Its dimensions are 2 ft. 6 in. X 2 ft. 5 in. x 1 ft. 3 in.

Fragments similar to this last boulder have been found in considerable

quantities                                                and from what the workmen say it appears that in past years
                                                       ;

many similar boulders have been discovered, and have been broken up

in order that they might be got out of the quarrymen's way.

  --Leicestershire. Mr. W. Jerome Harrison has sent the Committee the

following note on a Leicestershire boulder which has travelled north-
wards :

     In the construction of the sewerage for the Clarendon Park Estate,
near the Victoria Park, on the east side of the town of Leicester, some
interesting sections of the drift were laid bare, which I examined in

June 1880. Much of the drift exposed was of a loamy nature, containing

erratics of moderately large size, and overlying, though with no well-
marked line of demarcation between, the well-known great chalky
boulder clay which spreads so widely in this district.

    Among the travelled rocks contained in this deposit I particularly

noticed one angular block identical in appearance with the syenitic rock
which forms Enderby Knoll (4 miles south-west of Leicester), and Croft
Hill (about 2 miles farther in the same direction). These South Leicester-
shire syenites are well-characterised, and being somewhat abnoi'mal their

identification is easy.

The surface of the Clarendon Park Estate is about 300 feet above

sea-level                                         wLile Enderby Knoll is about 350 feet, and Croft Hill 450 feet
                                               ;

(these heights are approximations only). The block which I saw on the

Clarendon Park Estate measured about 3^ x 2 x Ih ft., and would
weigh about three-quarters of a ton ; it was irregular in shape and very

angular. As it did not interfere with the direct line of the sewer it was

not removed, but was covered in.'

Mr. J. Plant adds the following to his previous reports on the erratic

blocks of this county :

     Boulder in the parish of Aylestone (Ord. Map, 63 S.E.), in a field

opposite the third milestone S. of Aylestone. Its dimensions are 7 ft.

X 6 ft. X 4 ft. About one-third of the boulder is buried in the ground.
It is angular, and not known to have been moved by man. Longest axis,
N.N.E. No striations are visible. It is granite from Mount Sorrel,

boulders (which are for the most part coarse sandstones), occur at Garrat's

Hill, 3 miles N.W. Some smaller blocks, composed of millstone grit, must

have come 40 miles from the N.W. The group is about 250 feet above

sea-level. About an acre is covered by the boulders. There are seven

large blocks of sandstone within an area of about 20 square yards. They

Aare found in upper boulder clay lying upon middle glacial sands.

angular, and subangular. ]\Iany of the smaller boulders are striated on

both sides. They are derived from Mount Sorrel, Markfield, Hartshill,

Ashby Coalfield, South Derbyshire, and places near Eelvoir Castle. The

distance fi'om which these boulders have travelled ranges from miles to

40 miles. Of the blocks counted and measured, thirteen are granite

from Mount Sorrel of both the red and white variety. Of the remainder,

one is a block of black basaltic-looking rock, which may have come from

the Hartshill range,  Warwickshire                                                          the other             is  syenite from   Markfield.

The remaining twenty-two smaller blocks (not measured) are millstone

grit, mountain limestone, chert, hard calcareous grits of the upper portion

of the lower lias, and basaltic rocks. The group is about 230 feet above

sea-level. The area opened is between 5 and 6 acres, and the boulders

have gradually sunk to the bottom of the clay-pit, as the overlying

' drift ' in which they are found was gradually removed so as to get at

the marl underneath, and now they lie scattered over the pit. Thirty-

seven have been counted, and fifteen of them measure as stated above.

These blocks are found in middle sands and lower boulder clay, which

vary from 6 to 10 feet in depth, and rest upon the Upper Keuper Marl.

Two large photographs have been taken, showing some of these boulders

lying upon the red marl floor, and the lower boulder clay upon the

red marl.

On turnpike road opposite the New Gasworks, Aylestone (Ord. map, 63

N.E.) was found a group of three boulders. The smallest is 4 ft. X 3 ft.

X 3 ft.; the largest 6 ft. X 3 ft. 6 in. x 3 ft. They are subangular. The

large face of one of tlie boulders is ground smooth, and has a number of

striae in various directions. They are derived from Markfield, 6 miles N. W.

They are syenite, much decomposed by the decay of the felspar, and are
about 210 ft. above the sea-level. They were found in making a sewer
at a depth of about 4 ft. from the surface, resting upon the Upper Keuper
Marl. As they stretched from side to side of the excavation the two
large ones had to be blasted to sret them out. The blocks have been
removed to the Museum Grounds at Leicester.

     At Knighton, on the estate of Clarendon Park (Ord. Map, 63 N.E.),
is a group of boulders. The smallest is 1 ft. 6 in. x 1 ft. 6 in. x 1 ft.;
the largest 2 ft. 6 in. x 2 ft. X 2 ft. They are rounded, angular, and
subangular. Some of the lower lias blocks are polished, rounded, and
striated on both sides. These striations are in various directions. The
distances of the rocks from which they were derived are as follows
About 20 miles N.B. for the lias blocks ; 6 miles N.W. for syenites and
gi'anites ; 10 miles W. for greenstones. They consist of calcareous grita
from the upper beds of lower lias granites, syenites, and greenstones are

                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

in greatest number. The group is about 300 ft. above the sea-level. The
boulders from this locality extend over nearly 100 acres of ground, and
some of them have been described in former reports. They have been
found in making streets and sewers and digging foundations of houses,
lying in upper boulder clay and middle glacial sands.

     In the parish of Thurnby (Ord. map, 63 N.E.) is a large collection
of boulders. The smallest is a cube of 1 ft. ; the largest 6 ft. X 2 ft.

 X 1 ft. 6 in. Many are rounded and subangular. The majority are

scratched with shallow scratches on both, sides of the longer face at
various angles. They are derived from South Derbyshire, about 40 miles

N.W. They are composed of mountain limestone, millstone grit, and
permian rocks. The group is about .500 ffc. above the sea-level. The
greater portion of these boulders (of whicli there are many thousands
under a cubic foot) were turned out in making a tunnel on a new line
of railway from Leicester to Melton. An excavation was made in lower

boulder clay, which including the tunnel extended about 3 miles. This
lower boulder clay was found to be 80 ft. deep in the tunnel-shaft, and rested
on the black shales of the middle portion of the lower lias. Boulders
have been found in the adjoining villages, and have been described in
former reports.

   --Shropshire. The Committee have received from Mr. Luff a valuable

report upon the group of erratic blocks found in the neighbourhood of

Clun, Shropshire.
     Professor Lapworth has examined a series of specimens, and describes

them as Lower Llandovery grits and shales belonging to the Plinlimmon
group of central Wales. The hills from which they have been derived are
all south of Bala, and situated almost due west from their present position.

     The following are the most remarkable among a large number of.
boulders. The ' Great Boundari/ Stone,' marking the boundary of Clun
and Treverward townships. It is on Rock Hill, 52░ 24' 28" N.L.

3░ 3' 40" W.L., on the estate of Earl Powis. Its dimensions are

6 ft. X 6 ft. X 2"5 ft. No striations can be detected, but it is angular

from a point south of Machynlleth. It rests upon a bed of clay and rubble
above the Upper Ludlow rock. Height above the sea, 1,152 ft.

248 REPORT--1882.

This boulder may be calculated to contain from 8 to 10 cubic

feet, and is subangular. It is a pebble grit belonging to the Plin-

limmon group, and may have come, according to Professor Lapworth,

from the neighbourhood of Rhaydr. So far as can be observed, it rests
upon the same limit of bed as the Great Boundary Stone. Its elevation
above the sea is 1,327 feet, and it is the highest of all the boulders of the

group.

      The ' 10 Feet Boulder.'--This boulder is a pebbly grit of the Plin-

limmon group, and is very remarkable in many respects.

      It lies on the Clun Hill, near Pen-y-wern, 52░ 24' 20" N.L., 3░ 0' 30"
W.L., at an elevation of about 1,160 feet above the sea. It measures
10 ft. X 3 ft. X 3 ft., and weighs probably between 6 and 7 tons. It bears
every evidence of having stood upright in the ground for a very long
time. The base is tolerably angular and well-preserved, but the sides

and apex are much Aveathered. About 4 ft. from the base it is deeply
undercut, apparently all round, exactly as we should expect such a block

to be where (on the ground-line) it had been most exposed to the combined
influence of moisture and frost.

     About 120 yards distant, at the highest point of the hill it stands on,
is a clump of young firs. Old inhabitants remember, before the trees
were planted, a circle of stones (foreign-looking boulders), some 30 yards
in diameter, existed here. The farmers, finding this piece of ground

--useless for agricultural purposes, carted the refuse of their fields loose
--stones and weeds on to it, and afterwards the firs were planted.

Distinct traces of the stone circle are still to be seen.'

     The work of destruction among boulders is still going on with great
rapidity. Many specimens are heard of as having existed some years
ago, of which now no trace can be found. The Committee appeal, there-
fore, to observers in all parts of the country to assist them in completing
the record upon which they are engaged.

     ' Mr. LufE sends the following memorandum on the Clun 10 Feet Boulder :

    A' line drawn from the centre of this circle to the base of the boulder, if pro-

longed, on one side would meet the 23oint of lowest sunrise (December 21), and
on the other that of latest sunset (June 21). This I have tested by mariner's
comiaass, making careful allowance for variation of the needle, and higher elevation
of the opposite hills, and also by observation of sunset on and about the longest

day. The boulder lies on the S.E. side of the circle, and in my opinion has been

used as a gnomon to indicate the point at which the sun would be first seen on the

shortest day. A spot more favourable for the observation or worship of that luminary

could hardly be imagined. It is the centre of an amphitheatre of hills, the valleys

are out of sight, and nothing is in view but hill-top below, and the dome of heaven

above.

     ' It is impossible to say who first erected this rude obelisk, or worshipped at this
circle, but associated with them on the same range of hills are many clearly Neolithic
remains, nicely polished flint arrow-heads, flint cores, and broken fragments.

    ' It is to be hoped this interesting stone may be preserved as a monument of a

bygone age.'
ON FOSSIL POLYZOA.                 249

Third Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. H. C. Sorby,

   and ]\Ir. G-. E. Vine, appointed for the purpose of reporting

  --on Fossil Polyzoa (Jurassic Species British Area only).

  Drawn up by Mr. Vine {Secretary).

A PARTIAL examination of the Jurassic Polyzoa was made by Goldfuss,'

but I am not aware whether he had any English examples of the types

described and figured by him. With the exception of the Aulopora all

the types are foreign, and I do not find any reference to British species

in his text. In the ' Geological Manual ' of De la Beche, published in
1832, a list of species is given, but only two are named as found within

the British area Cellipora orhiculata, Goldfuss (= Berenicea, Lamouroux),

and Millepora straminea, Phill. In the ' Geology of York,' ed. 1835,
Phillips gave three species only M. straminea, Gellaria SmitJdi,'^ Scar-
borough, and an undescribed Betepora (?). When, in 1843, Professor
Morris published his ' Catalogue of British Fossils,' there was a large in-

crease of species, but many of these had not been thoroughly worked.
In 1854, Jules Haime examined critically the whole of the Jurassic
Polyzoa then known, and many English naturalists furnished him with
material from their own cabinets so as to enable him to correlate British

and foreign types. Lamouroux, Defranc, Milne-Edwards, Michelin,

Blainville, and D'Orbigny have published descriptions of Jurassic species,.

and a list of these, so far as I am able, will be given at the end of this

report. Professor D. Braun, by the publication of his paper on species
found in the neighbourhood of Metz, added materially to our knowledge

of French Jurassic types, and later foreign authors, Damortier, Waagen
and others, have increased the number of described species. Since the
publication of Haime's work much valuable material has been accumu-
lating in the cabinets of collectors, and I would willingly draw up a.
monograph if desired to do so. In the meantime I offer, in the following
report, a rather compact analysis of genera and species known by name

or otherwise to the palEeontologist.

  --Classification. Haime's arrangements of the Jurassic Polyzoa is very

simple ; all his species, excepting two, are placed in one family, the Tubu-

liporidce. In the ' Crag Polyzoa,' 1859, Mr. Busk gave a synopsis of
the ' Cyclostomata,' arranged in eight family groups, which Avere made

to include several Mesozoic types. This arrangement, with a slight

alteration, was followed by Smitt, Busk to some extent accepting the

modification for the arrangement of recent Cyclostomata in his later

work ('Brit. Mus. Cat.' pt. iii. 1875). The Rpv. Thomas Hincks
(' Brit. Marine Polyzoa,' 1880) disallows the family arrangement of Busk
in so far as it relates to British species. The Tubidiforidce, Hincks, in-

clude, in part, three of the families of Bask. In this report I shall

follow Hincks as far as I am able to do so, as many of the Jurassic
species may be included in the family Tuhidiporidce as now described.

It will, however, in the present state of our knowledge at least, be im-

possible to arrange the species stratagraphically, as many, having the

same type of cell, range from the Lias upwards. As far as I am able to

do so I shall give the range of the species, beginning, of course, with the

lowest strata.

1 have already done partial justice to the uniserial Stomatopora, found

in the Palaeozoic rocks ^ of this and other countries. I have again

studied the species described by James Hall, Professor Nicholson, and

myself, and I cannot, at present, detect any generic character in the

species that may be used by the systematic paleontologist to separate

the PalfBozoic from the Massozoic types. I must, therefore, regard the

--Btomatoporoi of the two epochs as one, though the sequence is broken in

the Palgeozoic no species having as yet, I believe, been recorded from

the Carboniferous series of this or any other country.

Jules Haime has already pointed out the striking differences between

the Alecto of Lamx. founded upon A. dicJwtoma and the Devonian

Aulopora                                            but  I  have  not been  able  to  verify  his  strictures  regarding
                                                 ;

the exclusion of the latter from this group. It may be possible, however,

to find that corals and polyzoa have been unwittingly united in some of

our identifications. Haime gives seven different Jurassic species as

found in the Lias and Oolite of this and other countries. As far as my

material will justify the assumption, I claim for our British area the

following charactei'istic types. As they are somewhat different I give the

characters of our own species and varieties.

     The peculiar habit and cell-character of this type is so distinct from
the former, that, after many grave thoughts, I have decided to give it the

above name. On the same coral are specimens of Diastopora.

      This species is found adherent to specimens of Biastopora from the
Bradford clay, and also from the Cornbrash of Stanton. It assumes

many peculiar habits, but the cell-arrangement generally is a rather con-

Фtant feature. Sometimes it approaches the character of 8. diclwtomoides,
D'Orb., at other times that of the recent 8. gramdata, M.-Ed. To the
latter species Hincks' assigns a remote ancestry, and it is a difficult
matter to say nay to his synonyms, and range in time, as all the nniserial

Stomatoporce may be closely related. My own specimens from the Green-

sand are too fragmentary to allow of a very close comparison.

     In our modern classification (Hincks) we have a sub-genus, Proioscina,

which links together the genei'a 8tomatopora and Tnhulipora. Haime's

second genus is also called Prohoscina, but there seems to me to be a great

diflference between the recent and fossil species. The type of the recent

sub-genus 8tomatopora incrassata, Smitt, is a very peculiar species as

regards the cells, and I know of no Jurassic type that can compare with
it. The type of Haime's genus is the Cellepora echinata, Munster or

Goldfuss. This latter species is a Tertiary type from Astrupp, and I fail
to recognise any species in the British area that can compare with this
either. Seeing that D'Orbigny applies the term Prohoscina and Idmonea
indifferently for certain species ; that Busk places the sub-genus with his
Alecto ; and that Hincks practically disallows the division, it seems to

me only a matter of very questionable convenience to retain it. There

are, however, certain as yet undescribed types in both the Inferior and

                                    ' Brit. Marine Polyzoa, vol, i. p. 426.

-- --Great Oolite tbat are really passage forms evolutionary stages which

can neither be claimed as Stomatopora nor Tubulipora, and much less as

Diastopora. With the exception of one species, I believe--the P. David-

--soni, Haime, from the Great Oolite of Hampton Cliffs all the other

types are from the foreign Jurassic areas. I cannot in my material re-

cognise P. Davidsoni, but I have drawings of species lent to me from

--the cabinets of Mr. Longe (Inferior Oolite), Mr. Walford, and Miss

Gatty (Great Oolite) that one would naturally place in this genus. The

one type, especially from Mr. Longe's cabinet from the Inferior Oolite of

Cleave, near Cheltenham, in some of its chai'acters approaches the

P. Jacquuti, Haime, from the Inferior Oolite, Montveaux. There are

other characters which would separate them widely. The same may be

said of a very beautiful type in the cabinet of Mr. Walford, procured from

the base of the Great Oolite. The species are adherent, as Haime de-

scribes, and meshes are formed by the inosculation of the branches, but

the cell characters and arrangements appear now as Stomatopora, and

anon as  Idmonea                                         and  I  can  well  understand  the  confusion  that  was
                                                      ;

painful for Haime to note, when he says, ' The CelUpora, ccJiinata, Gold-

fuss, appears to me to be the first fossil known to be referred to the

division (Proboscina). Tlie others, principally those of the Crag, have

been described as Diastopora or else as Tuhulipora, either by Michelin or

by Lonsdale. D'Orbigny has at first shown them under the name of

Idmonea, and afterwards that of Prohoscina, originally applied by Audouin

in 1826, He criticises Milne-Edwards for having called Criserpia a

species, which he, D'Orbigny, confounds with Prohoscina.'^

The true Idmonea as an erect Jurassic type I do not know, though

we meet with specimens partly adherent and partly erect in the cre-

taceous series. In the ' Catalogue of British Fossils,' Professor MottIs gives

Idmonea triquetra, Lamx., as found in the Great Oolite, Bradford, and

Haime describes the same species in his text, aud figures it (pi. vii. fig.
1, a.h). I notice the same Idmonea arrangement of cells as in many

undescribed species of Stomatopora (?) at present lying dormant in the
cabinets of collectors and students, and it is very ditficult to conceive

where these shall be placed in our modern classification, if we destroy the

genus Proboscina as a passage group, or get rid of Idmonea other than as

an erect type. Busk says ' Zoarium usually erect,' speaking of the

fam. Idmoneid^. Hincks, however, gives more latitude in his diagnosis

of the genus Idmonea, for he says ' Zoarium erect and ramose, or (rarely)

adnate.' Seeing that this latitude exists of partly adnate and partly

erect types in the work of one of our greatest systematists, I strongly

advise our local students to seek to throw light upon the origin of this

unique type of Cyclostomatous Polyzoa. The Idmonea triquetra is at

present unknown to me, and I can only point out the lines along which

research can be made.

There is yet another type given by Haime to which I must direct

particular attention. This is the Terehellaria of Lamouroux. I have

been unable to refer to the original works for a description of the genus,

but this has been done for me by George Busk, Esq., F.R.S., to
whom 1 am indebted for the following very valuable particulars of the

genus and species.

         ' Jules Haime, Jurassic Bryozoa, Genus Proboscina.
            ON FOSSIL POLYZOA.        25

            Terebellaria, Lamouroux.

      A' fossil, dendroid polypary, composed of cylindrical scattered

   branches, spirally twisted from left to right, or from right to left in-
   differently; pores prominent almost tubular, numerous, disposed quin-
   cnncially, and more or less inclined according to their position with the

   spires.'

        Lamouroux says the genus should be placed after the Millepores and
   before the Spiroporce, remarking ' that the Spiroporre have the cells or the

   pores projecting as in Terebellaria, but that this character is observable .

   only in well-preserved specimens. When the prominent part of the spire

   has been worn by attrition, it looks like a narrow riband wound round

   the branch.'

       Two species are described by the author, T. ramosissima and T.

   antilopa, from the Terrain a polypes at Caen.
        Hagenow's description is the same, but he includes in the genua

   Ceriopora spiralis, Goldfuss.

       D'Orbigny adopts the genus of Lamouroux with the following

   character:

        ' Colony entirely fixed by the base, whence spring thick cylindrical
   dichotomous branches, often very numerous, and forming a dendroid
   growth. Each branch presents three parallel spiral zones, which begin
   at th*e end of the branch in a projection formed exclusively of the germs

   of cells.' He enumerates four species T. gracilis, D'Orb.; T. antilopa,

   Lamx.; T. ramosissima, Lamx.; and T. tenuis, D'Orb.
        The peculiar habits of the species are remarkable. Haime says,

   ' The (colonial) development proceeds by layers of testules (cells), which
   superpose themselves by following a spiral line, and they increase after-
   wards downwards, covering themselves more and more.' In the figs.

   of pi. vi. typical features of the species ai-e given, but the very peculiar

   spiral habit of T. ramosissima shown in transverse section, and the
   checked winding habit of T. antilopa, shown in longitudinal section,

   which will be further alluded to, may be seen in the figures of Lamou-
   roux, of which Mr. Busk has furnished me with tracings.

        The fossils which ordinarily pass for species of Terehellaria in the

   cabinets of collectors are a very curious group that may be more closely

   studied. My own studies are made fi'om specimens from the Cornbrash,

   and Bradford Clay of Bradford and Stanton, Wilts, and it is from this

   locality that the School of Mines specimens were obtained.

        To properly master the details of colonial growth, it will be necessary
   to isolate a single colony. The one furnished by Haime as a specimen of
   a young colony on stone shows a tapering pi'oximal point, gradually
   widening by the addition of cells, till a certain fanlike shape is arrived

   Aat. similar growth to this is found in young colonies of Diastopora.

   If superficially examined it will be seen that the cells are peculiarly

   arranged, beautifully punctured, with an orifice sometimes circular, at

   other times semi-circular, and sometimes the cell characters of portions

   of the colony bear a resemblance to Bidiastopora ramosissima of D'Or-

   Abigny.  complete and critical examination of the type will show that

   any fragment of stone or shell is sufficient to form the nucleus of a colony.

   It begins with a primary cell and then enlarges in a spiral direction, but

   to what extent the riband-like growth would be carried without a check

I
254 REPOET-- 1882.

I am unable to say. In another direction a similar colony will be de-

veloped, the distal cells of which will ultimately meet and coalesce, both
colonies striking out in fresh directions till met by another check, the
growth not always being in an upward direction. The dendroid

character of species is perfectly accidental.

     With regard to the proper location of the type authorities differ. Pro-
fessor Busk places it in the family Idmonidce. In referring to Heretopora
(' Crag Polyzoa,' p. 121) he says, ' Milne-Edwai-ds, in his second edition of

Lamarck, 1836, placed amongst the heterogeneous Polypiers foramines,
Pustulopora, Ohrysaora, Theonoa, and Terebellaria.' Jules Haime places
the genus immediately after Idmonea and before Berenicea, and it is near
to, or, if need be, as a sub-genus of, Diastopora that I would be inclined
to leave it. In accordance with this I think it will be best to redescribe
the species.

                   Genus Diastopora, Lamx.

                   Sy. with Berenicea (pars), Lamx.

I am willing to accept this genus, in its wider sense, as defined by

Hincks yet I hardly think that it will be possible to include the whole
                                         ;

of the foliaceous forms of the Jurassic period in one group. In this

report I shall adhere to the arrangement of Busk, as I have done in my

two papers on the Diastoporidas, keeping the foliaceous types for distinct

study. At the same time I am willing to admit that in getting rid of one

difficulty in our grouping we open the door to admit others. Haime

admits  both  the  encrusting and  foliaceous  types                            accepting the genus
                                                                             ;

Berenicea for the encrusting, and Diastopora for simple-foliaceous and

retiform species. Professor Braun, in his Jurassic studies, separates the

species Diastopora foliacea from the group and establishes another, which

he calls Elea, claiming for his type certain peculiarities which have been

entirely overlooked by authors. It is very certain that the more closely

we examine Jurassic Polyzoa and compare them with modern species of

the genus Diastopora, the more divergent the types appear; and although

we would rather accept a simple than an elaborate classification, still

there are limits beyond which it is not wise to go.

     The genus Berenicea was established by Lamouroux, and included in

--it, beside the fossil species, B. diluviana from the environs of Caen two

living species. These, Haime says, he could not find in the Caen Museum ;
consequently they are not determinable by their figures alone. The

Zoarium is adherent-encrusting, and formed of superimposed layers ; the

development commences in a simple manner, and is radiating or fanlike.

The Diasiopora of Haime has a Zoarium with a large base, elevated,

foliaceous or frondescent, sometimes reticulated, formed of ascendant

leaves folding back upon themselves, and closely cemented in such a

manner as to present often two shelving planes of cells. Then the planes

are united by a laminated calcareous epidermis.^

Diastopora foliacea, of Lamx., covers two distinct types. One has been

well worked out by Professor Braun,- and upon this he seeks to estab-

lish the family Operculata, order Eleina, naming his type Elea foliacea.

The other species Milne-Edwards named D. Lamouroiixi ; and it forms

section of Haime and Edwards includes the whole of the Biserial species.

For these Blainville, in 1830, or rather for a section of the now recog-

nised species, founded the genus Mesenteripora, still retained by Busk in

the Crag Polyzoa and Cyclostomata,^ and in his list of Polyzoa collected

by Captain H. "W". Fielden (' Jour, of Linnjean Soc' 1880), and also by

Mr. Waters. Blainville's genus is again rechristened by D'Orbigny, and

becomes Bidiastopora                                                                                                  establishing for the D. lamellosa a special genus

which, he calls Latero-multelea.

                 Genus Diastopora, Lamouroux.

               Sy. with Berenicea (pars), Lamx., ' Expos. Meth.' 1821.

     Hainae figures and describes five species of Berenicea and fourteen

Diastopora as present in the Jurassic series. I shall only notice those
species which are found in the British area.

     I have already, in a previous paper,* drawn attention to four types
of Diastopora {Berenicea, Haime), not previously noticed by authors.
They are

       1. D. stomatoporides, Vine.                                                                                        3. D. oolitica, Vine.

       2. D. ventricosa                                                                                               ,,  4. D. cricopora ,,

These species range from the Lias to the Great Oolite ;. and for par-

ticulars, details, and description I refer the reader to the paper itself.

     Before leaving this purely descriptive part, I wish to speak of a

paper ' On the Relation of the Bscharoid Forms of Oolitic Polyzoa,' by

Francis D. Longe, F.G.S.^ In this paper Mr. Longe very ably discusses

certain peculiarities of cell- character, showing their apparent relationship

to the Escharoid forms of the Cheilostomata especially drawing the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

attention of the palaeontologist to the opercula of the Oolite species.

    There are many discrepancies in our modern classification of the

Polyzoa ; and Mr. Longe has, by the publication of this paper, increased

our knowledge of their number. Seeing that the whole of the remarks

are founded upon facts gleaned from a comparative study of Oolitic

specimens, we cannot do more than accept the hints and illustrations,

and work them into our future histories rather than ignore them altogether.

 I cannot, however, see my way clearly at present to accept without a

 demur his conclusions. As a ' suggestive sketch of the genealogical
 arrangement of certain famiUes,' Mr. Longe offers the following :

               ' Dendroid. Cricopora, Melicertttes, Entaloplwra.''

      The remaining portion refers to species found in the Chalk and sub-

 sequent periods.

                                           DlASTOPORA DILUVIANA.

                Bepto-multisparsa diluv., D'Orb.

      This species is present in the Inferior and also in the Great Oolite,
and the name should be restricted to the thin, papyraceous specimens
 which encrust, with varying habits, stones and shells. The Zoarium, in
its youngest stage, begins with a primary cell, which gi-adually increases
in size till a small fanlike outline is reached, some of the cells turning to
the right, others to the left of the primary one. After this the Zoarium
is of varying habit, and all the cells are deeply immersed, and specimens

appear like a continuous coeniceum, very much punctured, the peristomes
only rising but very slightly above the surface. The cells are distinct,

and in very sheltered parts of the Zoarium the distal portion of the tube

is much produced.

   --Localities. Inferior Oolite abundant at Cleave, near Cheltenham.

                     Bepto-multisparsa microstoma, D'Orb.

     I feel certain that this species, though much smaller in the cells, has

at times been identified with the one above. It is only on very rare
occasions that the two could be possibly confounded. The most distin-
guishing features of this species are the proliferous habits and the small-

ness of the cells. Some of the cells, too, appear like those of Biastopora

Lucensis.

   --Localities. Abundant in the Great Oolite, generally encrusting spe-

cies of Terehrattda. The cabinet of Mr. Walford very rich. Haime
gives Hampton Cliffs as one of the localities from which he obtained

his specimens.

     I wish to draw particular attention to this species on account of its

peculiar proliferous habits. Many of the fresh colonies originate from

some of the marginal cells of the older colony. They begin with a
primary cell as ordinary Biastopora, and the zoarium very soon assumes
a fanlike, then a circular, habit. Newer colonies also cover the older
ones, and the innumerable growths give a very thick appearance to the

blended Zoaria.

                   II. BiSERiAL Diastopora, Milne-Ed.

Mesenteripora, Blainville ; Bidiastopora, D'Orb. ; Ditaxia, Hagenow.

It is well that the encrusting and biserial Diastopora should be sepa-

rated, but not widely so. In the choice of the above names I havo

--selected the simplest Blastopores biserialaires of Milne-Edwards because
--it has the precedence of the Bidiastopora of D'Orb. Busk in the ' Crag
--Polyzoa'and in the ' Brit. Mus. Cat.' pt. iii. has chosen Blainville's

name for this division of the group.

    My chief objection to Blainville's term for the biserial species may be

found in the diagnosis as given by Busk : ' Cells in two layers, parted by

a calcareous septum.' In all the specimens figured in ' Crag Polyzoa ' '

of Mesenteripora meandrina the transverse sections of the folia,ceous zoa-

rium are shown to have this septum very distinct. In many of Haime's

figures where cross sections are given, the septa are also shown to be

present. It seems to me, judging from the foliaceous specimens in my

own cabinet, that this ' calcareous septum ' is only an apparent, and not

a real character. If sections are made in a line with the cells, the only

axis visible is that made by sections of the cell-walls. In a cross section

of the foliations there is an apparent septal division, but the more closely

this is examined the less real will it be. The septal divisions of D. scohi-

nula, D. Terquemi, and D. cervicornis, as given by Haime, show one, two,

and three sections of cells on either side of the septal line ; and specimens

of Inferior Oolite species found in the neighbourhood of Cheltenham are

in many respects of a similar character. As I have been able to examine

only a very limited number of species, I should be glad to have more

detailed information if students of our Oolitic Polyzoa will address their

attention to this point. Meanwhile, by selecting the divisional name of

Milne-Edwards I shall not commit myself to any generic name dependent

upon a questionable structural character.

Jules Haime, after very careful working, saw reason for establishing

fourteen species of biserial Diastopora, the whole of which are not found

in the same horizon in either this or other countries. Leaving D.foliacea

and X*. Lamourouxii we have nine foliaceous species as common to the

Jui'assic Fauna generally. Some of these range from the Inferior to the

Great  Oolite and  the Cornbrash                                                                   whilst  others,  so far  as  observation at
                                                                                                ;

present favours us, are confined to one horizon only. Two species given

--by Haime D. Michelini, Blainville, and D. Eudesana ^range from the

Inferior  Oolite through the  Great Oolite                                                                 and, according to Busk, is
                                                                                                  ;

possibly identical with the Mesenteripora meandrina found amongst the

Crag Polyzoa, and in recent Arctic fauna. I cannot assert positively that

the species are identical, or that we ought to accept all the synonyms of
Busk : still there is great probability in their favour ; but the fi-ag-

ments of Busk will bear no comparison in point of size with the fin&

the Bidlastopora and Mesenteripora meandrina of D'Orb. Mr. Lono-e

--who has made careful observations on the species has selected for illus-

tration the most typical features of cell arrangement and character of the

two types                                               and   Dr.  Woodward, in           the  beautiful                                   plate which  illustrates
                                                     ;

Mr. Longe's paper on the ' Escharoid Forms of Oolitic Polyzoa,' ' has

Adoneample justice to the selection.                                                              comparison of the two types of

cell in figs. 2 and 3 of that plate will give special details of structure

sufficient to justify Haime in their separation as species. It must not be

supposed, however, that the character and arrangement of the cells are

always so clearly defined as in the plate. The cells vaiy very much, and

it may be possible to find similarly shaped cells to these in other species

of the Oolitic Diastopora.

Haime gives us another type of Diastopora cell as found in a species

in the Inferior Oolite of this country, and also in the Great Oolite of Ran-

ville and Caen. In the plate already referred to (fig. 4) Mr. Longe has-

selected for typical illustration a specimen from Caen. Haime calls it D.

lamellosa, Mich., and gives as its synonyms Elea, Multelea and Latere-

mtdtelea Banvilliana, D'Orb. and Eschara Banvilliana - of Michelin.
Relying upon the evidence of Mr. Longe, I cannot help but select his

opinion on this type. Speaking of the illustration, pi. 11, fig. 4, ' Geo.
Mag.' Jan. 1881, he says, ' I have little doubt but that this form is the

JEschara Ranvilliana of Michelin. In his figure the areolation is slightly

more angular than in the part shown in (my) figure. Jules Haime has
classed a somewhat similar form as B. lamellosa. D'Orbigny's EscJiara

or Elea triangularis is evidently a very similar form.' ^ The type of cell

I am not familiar with as a British species.

In the Biastopora Waltoni, Haime, and in the B. Bavidsoni, Haime, one

from the Inferior Oolite near Cheltenham and the other from the Great

Oolite Hampton Cliffs, we have types of cells far from being unique. The

same may be said of the cells of B. Eudesana, Haime, also a Great Oolite

type.    The                                            same  peculiarity  of   cell      structure                                   and  arrangement  may be

        _

found in some of the adherent or encrusting Biastopora, as in the more

richly developed foHaceous species, but whether the foliaceous species as

a whole are developed from the encrusting forms I am unable to say. In
all probability they may have been so, and this would justify the Rev.

T. Hincks in breaking up the artificial divisions and classifying the

foliaceous and the encrusting species under one generic term.

In the B. cervicornis,^ Michelin, of which species the Bidlastopora and

Elea cervicornis of D'Orb. are synonyms, we have very insufficient data to

deal with. It is said to occur both in the Great Oolite of Ranville, and in

the Bradford Clay of Pound Hill. I am not acquainted with the species

as a British type.

     Many valuable foliaceous types are in the cabinet of Mr. Longe, and
a few are in the Musenm of the School of Mines, and in the Cambridge
Museum. Some few of Mr. Louge's specimens I have been allowed to ex-

amine, and I have five species in my own cabinet. These I have examined

both in the mass and in sections before drawing up the details furnished
in this report. It is high time that a monograph of British Jurassic
Polyzoa should be undertaken by some competent authority before the
masses of material at present in the hands of private collectors are again
scattered, as previous collections have been, without note or comment.

Besides my own specimens I have examined many in the cabinets of

Mr. Walford and his friends. If these could be compared with the type
specimens named by Haime, a more valuable addition to Paleontology

could be made than we at present possess. In the work of Professor

Phillips, ' Geology of the Valley of the Thames, 1871,' it is painful to
read his remarks on the Polyzoa of the various formations laid bare in

the valley. Speaking of Liassic Polyzoa, he says, ' specimens have been
observed at Fenny Compton.' Of the Infei'ior Oolite, ' Insufficiently

--examined in the series.' In the Great Oolite only four species are given
   Alecto dichotoma ; Cricopora straminea, Phill. ; Diastopora diluviana, and

Terehellaria ramosissima.

     Of the Oxford Oolitic Period, Phillips says, ' The rarity of Polyzoa in
the Oxford Oolites and Clays is somewhat remarkable, and appears to
be in some way related to the even more remarkable rarity of Brachio-
poda, on whose shells in the Bath Oolites so many of these beautiful

objects ai'o found.' ' In the Cretaceous system (p. 434), a list of nearly
fifty species of Polyzoa is given by the author as occurring in the valley

of the Thames.

    I have before me a very valuable series of notes compiled by Mr.
Walford, on species of Polyzoa found in his own neighbourhood. If other

students would undertake to furnish notes of a similar character of other
localities, a compilation of the range of types would be easily made. As it

is we have insufficient data and ill-digested identifications to deal with.

     I have already vindicated by use and preference the retention of this
genus for species of Palaeozoic Polyzoa.^ I still retain the name for

species of the genus very common in the Mesozoic rocks. I have also

given the synonyms with their dates of genera intended to supersede

Lamouroux's original term. It may be as well to define and limit the

genus as applicable for the reception ofPalaeozoic, Mesozoic, and Cainozoic

species. I am not aware that any recent species of Polyzoa can be in- -

eluded in the group.

     This species has been very well described by Professor Tate in the

above magazine. I have seen the type specimen, which is in the Museum
of Practical Geology. But my own specimens, given to me by Mr. Walford,

are different from the types of Tate. The zoarium is more flattened

and the cells are longer and more irregular. The type of cell approaches

nearer to that of Diastopora stomatopor ides, Yine ('Jour, of Geol. Soc'

     This species as figured and described by Phillips in the above work is
that ordinarily mot with in fragments. The zoarium is dendroid, variously
branched, branches anastomosing so as to form an intricate amalgamation
of branches, all of which are of the ordinary size. Zooicia tubular, arranged

in series spirally, peristomes circular, slightly raised.

     This species is widely distributed, ranging from the Lower Oolite to
the Greensand , and on account of the very peculiar habit of the amalgama-
tion of the branches it received from Defranc the name of Intricaria.
Blainville gave two species the name of Cricopora, because the cells are

arranged in rings. This is the character o? Ceriopora verticillata, Goldfuss,

which is given as a synonym of the species by Professor Braun. It has
also received the name of Latero-tnbigera from D'Orb., but Professor
Braun prefers to adopt the generic name of Entalopliora for the two
species described by him as found in the middle Jura of the neighbour-

--hood of Metz.

         Entalophora cellaeoides, Lamx. (Pustulopora, Nicholson.)

                  Plate ix. fig. 8, a. b. Haime's 'Jurassic Bryozoa.'

     This species is described by Haime as above. It is very different from
any of the Spiropora described by him, and he says that an ' incomplete
example was furnished to him by Walton, procured from Hampton Cliff.'
I am not acquainted with the type.

     Judging from the figures given by Nicholson (p. 430, ' Paleontology,'
vol. i.), this is a true Entalophora, well deserving of separate recognition.
Under any circumstances it could not be confounded with Spirupora.

                             Fam. III. HoRNEEiD^. Hincks.

     This family contains only one genus, Hornera. There is no repre-

sentative of the family, in Brit. Jurassic Rocks at least, and I am not aware

of any recorded species of the genus in Foreign Oolites. As the Rev. Thomas
Hincks says that ' the genus Hornera is connected with Tubuliporidj:,
through Idmonea,' to which it bears in many points a very close resem-
blance,' in all probability early types of the genus, as defined by him,
may yet be found in either the Jurassic or Cretaceous rocks. The Sipho-
dictyum, of Lonsdale, is given as one of the synonyms of Hornera.^

                                   Fam. IV. LiCHENOPOBiD^.

     This is the last family given by Hincks in which Jurassic Polyzoa can
be placed. The genus Lichenopora of Defranc has also a number of
synonyms, but as species of the genus are rare in the Oolites, we find
only one recorded. Haime says the genus has not been represented until

now, other than by Tertiary or Cretaceous fossils. In Lichenopora

PhiUipsii, dsrived from the Great Oolite of Hampton Cliff, the zoarium is
disciform, very slightly elevated, and adherent only by the middle of its
inferior face. The upper surface resembles a fungus, with unequally
developed rays formed of a series of long zooecia, ordinarily doubled. The

peristomes are polygonal, regular, and closely connected.

     Species of the genus, in all probability the same as above described, are
found in the Inferior Oolite, but too indistinct for description.

     Another peculiar genius of Lamouroux's is accepted by Haime

--Apsendesia in which to place two species of Jurassic Polyzoa. In his

synoptical arrangement of the Polyzoa Cyclostomata, Busk places this

genus in the family Theonoidje : ' Zoarium massive sub-globose, or
irregular; zooecia contiguous crowded.' Haime describes in the foreign
Oolites two species A. cristata, Lamx., and A. clypeata, Lamx. I

--have no means of studying these, but Professor Braun, in his paper, places

as the synonyms of Apsendesia Defrancia and PeJagia. In his descrip-

--tion of the i'ascictdaria of the Crag one of the genera of THEONOiPiE

Mr. Busk places Apsendesia (pars), Blainville questioning its affinity
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

with Lamouroux's type, as one of the synonyms of the Fascicidaria of

Milne-Edwards. Facially the specimens of Lichenopora found in our own
Oolites may bear some resemblance to the figures of Haime, but as there was
some confusion in the mind of Blainville when drawing up the characters

of the genus Apsendesia, the student will do well to refer to the ' Crag

' Brit. Maiine Polyzoa, vol. i. p. 467.  * Hid.
262 REPORT--1882.

Polyzoa ' (p. 139) for a description of Fascicularia, as given by Busk, and
its relationship to Apsendesia cristata, Lamx.

    Since the above was written, Mr. Walford has kindly furnished me

with the following note on this genus, and of species in his own cabinet.

^Apsendesia cristata, Lamx. The Barford, Oxon, specimen agrees

fairly with Haime's description, excepting that it seems to be attached

not by a central base, but to be adherent by its whole breadth. It seems

to be more regular than most of the forms figured.

                                                                                                           ;

There are still several genera described by Haime which, on account

of their rarity, have not been so closely studied. One of these Fascicu-

--lipora, a genus of the family Frondiporida, Busk has assigned to it a

species F. Waltoni, Haime. It is found in the Great Oolite at Hampton

Cliff. This genus is still represented by at least two species in the

Australian and South Patagonian Seas. In the Crag Polyzoa three

species are described under the generic term of Fungella, Hagenow, in the

family Ceeioporida, Busk.

  --Theonoa, Lamx., is represented by three species, one of which -T. Boiver-

hanhii, Haime is found in the Inferior Oolite of Cheltenham, both by

Bowerbank and by Walton.

     The genus Gonstellaria was founded by Dana, and is probably synony-

mous with Stellipora, Hall, and Radiopora, D'Orb. I am not acquainted

with the type in our English Oolites. The only example known

--G. Terquemi, Haime was discovered in the Infra Oolite (Metz) by

M. O. Terqueim. The zoarium is encrusting, with short zuascia, erect,

prismatic, slightly unequal in width, of two kinds : the one more erect,

disposed in a double or triple or radiating series ; the other very short,

occupying the interval of the rays. Two recent species of Radiopora,

--D'Orb., are given by Busk, and one B. cristata in some respects answers

to the description of the Oolitic species as given by Haime. Radiopora

is placed in the Ctclostomata, pp. 34-35, with the Discoporellida. In

placing the G. Terquemi in the genus Gonstellaria, Haime says, ' I do not

find any essential difference between the Palaeozoic Fossils and those of

the secondary period, which D'Orbigny calls Radiopora, and they are

bound, without doubt, to form one and the same genus.'

The genus Ghilipora is one of the Heteroporida types, and it, too, is

founded upon a single unique example. There are, however, characters

about the peristome and also the interjacent openings of G. guernoni,

Haime, altogether at variance with the known types of British Heteropora.

The specimen was found at Ranville, in the Great Oolite.

                 1835. Neuropora, Bronn.

                 Chrysaora, Lamx. Filicaria, D'Orb.

      Species belonging to this genus are present in our British Oolites, in
the Bradford Clay, and Cornbrash, but I have not been able to secure
specimens to operate upon so as to study the internal characters.

Dumortier describes several species from the Middle Lias, Haime de-
scribes three from the Great Oolite of Ranville and Hampton Cliffs, and

' Letter, June ] , 1882.    - Jurassic Bryozoa, p. 206.

Professor Braun says that it extends from the Lower Lias onward into

the White Jnra and also into the Great Oolite of Ranville. It is also

found about Metz. Through the kindness of Professor Roemer of Breslau

I have had supplied to me the species of Ceripora, Goldfuss, which are

referable to this genus, but the types diflfer in many particulars from our

own species.

One peculiar type is separated from the genus Neuropora by Haime,

and is made the Oolitic type of the genus Acanthopora, D'Orb. It is
A --the Ghrysaora spinosa of Michelin.
                                       specimen of the genus Semycitis
--another Ghrysaora type was found by Walton at Bath. The British

species of Neuropora and allies are

                                       and Geriopora angulosa, Quen.

              ,, Befrancii, Haime.

                      1834. Heteeopoea, Blainville.

We have now left one group of Oolitic Fossils which within the last

few years have been more closely studied than any of the others, because

of their supposed relationship with the Palaeozoic Monticulipora.

In his ' Petrifactions of Germany,' Goldfuss placed in the genus Oerio-

jpora three species, which he describes and figures ' as containing large and

small openings on the surface of the branches. These were Geriopora

anomalopora, C. cryptopora, and G. dichotoma, all of which were from the

Mastricht beds of Astrupp or Nantes. In 1834 M. de Blainville separated

these from the Geriopora of Goldfuss, and established another one for their

reception which he called Heteropora, assigning as essential structures the

two sorts of openings, but giving very few details respecting the genus.

After this Milne-Edvvai-ds added to them Millepora dumitosa and corigera,

Lamouronx. In his 'Miocene Fossils of North America,' ^ Mr. Lonsdale

oomplained of the inadequate description of Blainville as not having in

it sufficient details ' to enable an opinion to be formed of its complete

characters, or of the nature of the minor openings.' This error was to

some extent rectified by Lonsdale, and we owe to him the merit of being

the first author who clearly indicated upon sufficient grounds the real

zoological position of the genus. Jules Haime, in his ' Jurassic Bryozoa '

(pp. 207-8), redescribes the genus, and as his diagnosis has particular

j?eference to Oolitic types, I reproduce a portion of his description.

' Zoarium of variable form, but chiefly dendroid.

     ' Zooecia apparently united by some lamellar prolongation of the walls,
whence result some intermediary tubes, the terminal aperture of which

has been closed by a thin calcai'eous pellicle, but which perhaps were

themselves intended to become young cells. When externally examined

two different sets of openings are seen, varying in size, sometimes circular,

at other times polygonal. . . . There are fundamental differences between

the peristomes of the true cells  and  those  of  the  intermediary openings
                                                                                                                                                    ;

still, the matter of the young cells is very uncertain, and is not of any

specific value (?).'

    In accordance with this decision, Haime admitted only two species

--Heterojiora conifera and H. pustulosa- where Michelin admits seven, and

D'Orbigny eight.

    In Ms classical ' Monograph of the Fossil Polyzoa of the Crag' (1859),
Professor Busk very much simplifies the diagnosis of Haime, because, as

I think, the types of the ' Crag ' were more suitable for this purpose than

those of the Cretaceous or Oolitic periods.

      ' Zoaritmi erect, cylindrical, undivided or branched ; surface even,

furnished with openings of two kinds : the larger representing the orifices
of the cells, and the smaller the ostioles of the interstitial canals or tubes.'
' Crag Polyzoa,' p. 120.

     Since this was written species of recent Heteropora have been dis-

covered and described by A. W. Waters, E.G. S.,' from the neighbourhood
of Japan, and by Professor Busk from the neighbourhood of New Zealand,^

and a critical study of these species has thrown some little light upon

particular structures in the Oolitic types. I fail, however, to detect, either

in the descriptions of the recent, or in my own investigations of the

ancient type, any evidence, or characters, that would be sufficient to

establish a link between Monticuli'pora and Heteropora, or, in other words,
between Tabulate Corals (which have intercellular ; openings like Hetero-

pora) and Polyzoa. Yet it is very strange that in the Mesozoic epoch we
should have well-developed types like Heteropora which we are content

to call Polyzoa, and yet be unable to associate them with Palteozoic species
having similar external characters. But it is so, and without seeking to
do violence to structural evidence we must wait for future light by simply
working and watching.

Professor H. AUeyne Nicholson, F.L.S., in his two works on the

' Structure and Affinities of the Tabulate Corals of the Palaeozoic Period,'

1879,                           p.  256                        and  in  the ' Structure  and  Aflinities  of  the Genus                               Monti-

affinity of Heteropora and Monticulii^ora. As the whole of his remarks
are founded upon structural evidence I willingly refer the student to the

elaborate details furnished by the author. Generally I agree with Pro-

fessor Nicholson, but much yet remains to be done in the correlation of

the Mesozoic and Pateozoic types.

Preliminary Report of the Comonittee, consisting of Professor W.
   C. Williamson, and Mr. Wm. Cash (Secretary), on the Flora of
   the ' Halifax Hard Bed,^ Lotver Coal Measures.

The present Report is on the fossil plant-remains, whiclL are found in a

singularly perfect state of preservation in a thin bed of impure coal in
the ' gannister ' series of Halifax and its neighbourhood, in the county
of York.

     Our observations relate to an examination of specimens from numerous
coal-pits situated on an area extending from the vicinity of Bradford on
the north to Sheffield and district on the south.

     Many of the pits in the district now indicated are no longer worked,

partly on account of the reduced price of coal of late years and partly
because the iron pyrites brought up in working the coal (which was
formerly sold for chemical purposes) has been superseded by the im-
portation of sulphur at a cheap rate from Italy and other countries.

      These influences have acted adversely upon your Committee, since
some of the best pits for the special ' coal balls ' in which the coal plants

are found have been closed. Still, we have to report the acquisition of a
goodly number of ' coal balls ' which await examination. Before their

contents can be properly studied they will have to be cut into thin slices

preparatory to microscopical investigation. Already we have prepared
upwards of one hundred microscopical slides for cai-eful study.

      Halifax appears, so far as our observations go, to be the centre of this

rich Carboniferous flora. The bed in which the fossils are found is
two feet three inches thick in the neighbourhood of Halifax, and consists
of an impure coal, which in many places is thickly studded with nodules,
or, as they are locally called, ' coal balls.' These are composed chiefly
of carbonate of lime, some carbonate of magnesia, along with smaller
quantities of oxide and sulphide of iron, sulphates of soda and potash,
and a little silica. These nodules contain imbedded rootlets, stems,
leaves, Lepidostrobi, spores, and occasionally the mycelium of fungi.

     The state of preservation of the fossils is very remarkable ; the tissues
of the plants are infiltrated with carbonate of lime and the cell- walls
are carbonised, so that in thin slices prepared for the microscope the

minutest details are clearly defined.

     The roof of the ' hai^d bed ' is a thin stratum of shale filled with the
flattened valves of a bivalve shell (Aviculopecfcen) ; above this is a bed of
shale with numerous calcareous nodules, coated and often impregnated
with iron pyrites, and containing fossil shells of the genera Aviculo-
pecten, Goniatites, Nautilus, Orthoceras, and others, a very prevalent
fossil being Goniatites Listen. The base of the bed is composed of
' gannister,' and abounds in Stigmarian roots.

     In the northern part of our district around Bradford the * coal balls '
are scarce, and so highly charged with iron pyrites that plant-remains
suitable for microscopical examination very rarely occur. The same
remark applies to Huddersfield, and in a somewhat less degree to the
southern area around Hazlehead and Shefiield.

     The three most prolific localities are situated at Sunny Bank, South-
owram, at Sugden Pit, Bradshaw, and near BUand, all of which are in
the immediate neighbourhood of Halifax, but unfortunately the two
268 REPORT-- 1882.

latter pits are now closed, whilst the number of nodules brought up
from the Sunny Bank Pit is much restricted. The state of preservation

of the fossils is, however, most excellent, surpassing in this respect even
those from the famous Oldham and other Lancashire beds.

     So far as we have been able to study the fossils collected daring
the past year, we succeeded in throwing considerable light upon the
structure of Asteropliyllites (^Myriopliylloides') Williamsoni, upon Calamo-

stachys Binneana, especially in relation to the structure of its central
axis, upon a hitherto undescribed form of Kaloxylon, upon Lyginodendron
Oldhamium, and several other minor forms of plants, the structure and

affinities of Avhich are as yet imperfectly understood. Indeed, an enor-

mous amount of work remains to be done. We have already a very large

number of objects with the structure of which we are well acquainted
but the true botanical relations of which are entirely unknown to us.
In the case of some of these, persevering research has already enabled us
to ascertain those relations, and we doubt not that a continuance of that
perseverance will sooner or later enable us to throw a definite light upon
many of those whose botanical history is yet obscure.

INFLUENCE OF BODILY EXERCISE ON THE ELIMINATION OF NITBOGEN. 269

Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. Pye-Smith, Dr. M.
   Foster, and Dr. Burdon Sanderson, appointed for the pu7pose
   of investigating the Influence of Bodily Exercise on the Elimina-

    tion of Nitrogen {the experiments conducted by Mr. North).

In presenting an account of the expenditure of the grant of 501. made

to us last year for the purpose of investigating the effect of muscular

labour on the elimination of nitrogen, we beg to submit the following

statement of the present position of tlie inquiry.

   --The subject naturally divides itself into two parts (1) The analysis

of the ingesta and excreta, and (2) the work. The experiments under
the former head have been carried out with funds derived from another
source, and have arrived at a point at which it becomes desirable to
employ some means by which the relative amount of work done at
diffei'ent times can be compared with the utmost practicable exactitude.

     The grant has been expended in providing a machine for this purpose,
and for certain accessories.

     The machine consists essentially of an arrangement by which a

-- --weight the amount of which can be regulated may be raised through

a known distance and then allowed to fall to its position of rest.
     Without entering into a detailed account of the apparatus it will

suffice here to describe the arrangement by which the muscular recoil at
the end of the stroke is got rid of.

     As will be seen in the accompanying photographs,' the force is exerted,
not directly upon the weight, but upon a cam keyed on to the same axis

as the pulley which carries the weight. By means of this cam the work

at the end of the stroke rapidly diminishes to practically nothing, and in
consequence there is no muscular recoil. The handle by which the weight

is raised carries an automatic clutch so arranged that, when the weight
has been raised to a certain point, it is released. The descent of the
handle by its own weight causes the clutch to part an eye on the end of

the rope attached to the cam, and the operation can then be repeated.
The apparatus has been so constructed that the work can be done in any
position, from the vertical to the horizontal. The photographs show it
arranged for the latter.

     The machine is completed and ready for use, and Mr. North hopes
during the ensuing year to be able to make a number of experiments
Avith it upon the effect of varying amounts of work upon the elimination

of nitrogen.

     " These have not been engraved, as they represent the machine in a state not

quite perfected.

First Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Flower,
   Dr. Beddoe, Mr. Brabrook, Mr. F. Gtalton, Mr. J. Park Harri-

   son {Secretary), Dr. Muirhead, Greneral Pitt-Rivers, Mr. F. W.
   RuDLER, and Mr. Charles Roberts, aiypointecl for the purpose of

   obtaining Photographs of the Typical Races in the British Isles.

Owing to the accumulation of observations of height, weight, and

other physical characteristics of the inhabitants of the British Isles, the
discussion of which required the undivided attention of the Anthropo-

metric Committee, the acquisition of photographs undertaken by them in
1876 was last year transferred to a Committee of the Anthropological

Department.

     The photographic portraits already collected have been handed over
to the new Committee, and will assist materially in determining the
values of crosses in different parts of the country. Some, obtained under
exceptionally favourable circumstances, and especially seventeen portraits

of Shetland islanders, well illustrating the Scandinavian element in the

population, and presented by Dr. Muirhead, may be safely termed

typical.                                                      clear definition of racial

features, illustrated by examples, will, the Committee believe, prove of

considerable importance in connection with more than one social question.

    1. First ; as tending to allay national animosities springing from a

belief in the preponderance of some one race ; and, in connection with

this affording a safe basis for generalisation, in the place of deductions

depending on doubtful traditions and insufficient historical data.

   A2. correct description of the main racial types would also afford an

opportunity of testing in a more complete manner than is now practic-

able the truth of views, believed to be extensively held, on the. subject of

racial tendencies and proclivities.

    3. Indirectly ; by indicating the way in which features, and more

especially profiles, of human beings should be observed, it would lead to

a more exact description of         criminals      and deserters                                                              resulting,  it cannot
                                                                                                                           ;

be doubted, in more frequent arrests. At present, so little attention is

paid to the subject that photographs of prisoners are taken solely in full

face и and the description of recruits for the military rolls is confined, so

far as their features are concerned, to the colour of the hair and eyes.

  --The popular view regarding the possihility of a. survival of racial features

at the present day. Before proceeding further, the Committee think it
will be well to notice an objection, not infrequently made, that European

populations are now too mach mixed to allow of racial types being recog-

--nised. This is not the belief of anthropologists generally. Professor

Rolleston whose loss this Committee has especial reason to deplore

expressed no uncertain opinion on the subject in his address to the

Anthropological Department at Bristol. ' At once, upon the first inspec-

tion of a series of crania, or, indeed, of heads, from such a (mixed) race,'

he said it was evident that ' some were referable to one, some to another,

of  one,  two,  or  three  typical  forms  :       also that  intercrossing                                                   has         left  the

dence, ' and in the possession of an overwhelming numerical representa-.

tion : ' and Professor His was quoted as having arrived at a similar con-

clusion from an investigation of the ethnology of Switzerland.'

     Professor Kollmann, too, of Bale, believes that it is quite possible to
distinguish original or main racial characteristics in a mixed population,

owing to a capacity in skulls and facial skeletons to joreserve their

pristine types long after the colour of the hair and eyes have changed

Aby crossing.                   complete fusion of component elements, the distinguished

--Professor is convinced, never absolutely occurs.
      'Reversion to original types. Besides, however, these composite forms,

eminent anthropologists recognise a law through the operation of which

reversion takes place, under favourable circumstances, to original types.

Drs. Beddoe, Barnard Davis, Flower, Rolleston, Thurnam, and Turner,

in this counti'y, and Morton, Broca, Quatrefages, Retzins, and Virchow,

abroad, are in accord in believing, from craniological evidence, that the

characteristics of prehistoric races exist at the present day ; Professor

Quatrefages, than whom the Committee believe there could not be

a safer authority, even affirming that representatives of the fossil types of

man are still to be found amongst us.'-

  --Height, and colour of the hair and eyes, insufficient as evidence of race.

Assuming the correctness of Professor Kollmann's deductions that hair

and eyes (permanent in a pure race) change by crossing more easily than

skull-forms ; dark tints, except under conditions of intensity, joined with

diminutive stature and complete doHchocephalism, such as unmistakably

point to the race styled Iberian, simply indicate, according to the

index of nigrescence established by Dr. Beddoe, more or less mixture in

blood. Where, too, the hair and eyes are light, and the stature tall, in

the absence of information respecting the features generally, it would be

impossible to pronounce any individual to be Celt or Saxon, Dane or

Swede.

     Birth of parents and grandparents in the same locality no proof of race.

An experiment made for the purpose of ascertaining how far the birth

of parents and the grandparents, on both sides, in certain districts would

assist in the selection of pure local types, resulted in the conclusion that

the requirement mentioned, though securing the absence of recent foreign

admixture, failed as a sufficient test, by affording no evidence that move-

ments had not occurred in the population at an earlier date.

Photographic portraits obtained under the above-mentioned conditions

do not, as a fact, assist materially in the definition of racial character-

istics                          the features exhibit moi'e than one type even in districts supposed
                             ;

to have been peopled by a given race ; though, owing to the law already

alluded to, pure types may be sought for, and would more frequently be

found amongst such populations than elsewhere.

     This, and other considerations, led a sub- Committee, in 1880, to
collect in preference, from different localities, a certain number of portraits,

all of which exhibited similar features ; and then an equal jiumber dis-
tinguished by characteristics in all respects diffisrent from the first series,
but equally homogeneous. They presented contrasts which appeared to

be racial.

  --Method of Identification of Types adopted hy the Committee. Approaching

the subject from the standpoint of comparative physiognomy alluded to

in the last paragraph, but experimenting in the first instance on the facial

skeletons of skulls obtained from ancient tumnli and cemeteries in different

parts of the British Isles, it was found on superimposing tracings of the

skeleton profiles of the three main types figured in the ' Crania Britannica,'

that the brows of the Brachycephalic, round-barrow type were more

prominent, and the nasal bones more angular and sharply projecting, than

those of  the  Dolichocephalic, long-barrow type                                                                                                                                                        whilst brows and nasals
                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

in the Teutonic skulls (and especially those of the Saxons proper)

were respectively smooth and little prominent. The main characteristics

in the profiles of the Round-barrow man and the Teuton would clearly

have been the high bridge of the nose of the former, and the absence

of an arched nose in the Saxon.

     Similar results were obtained from measurements of skulls in the

Anatomical Museum at Cambridge, purchased from Dr. Thurnam by
Professor Humphry, and presented by him to that University. Also some
skulls in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, and the Greenwell

collection at Oxford, have been measured and found to exhibit the same

contrasts. Mr. Harrison, who obtained the measurements for the infor-

mation of the Committee, found that the mean difference in projection

of the nasal bones in skulls from the round-barrows, as measured from

the basion to fixed points on the dorsum and the nasion, or root of the

nasal bones, is about twice that observed in purely Teutonic crania. In

the fine collection of true Saxon skulls from Wiltshire, obtained by General

Pitt-Rivers, the principal characteristics are a rounded forehead and

smooth brow, and but little projection in the nasals                                                                                                                                                                                                                               and this in the male
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

as well as the female skulls.

The points of contrast in the skeleton features of the two races were

noticed   by  Dr.  B. Davis                                            but  owing  to  Saxons and Angles being at the
                                                                    ;

time he wrote considered equally Teutonic, the differences observed in

some of the examples selected by him to illustrate types, are not so

strongly mai'ked as in others. Dr. Beddoe and Mr. David Mackintosh,

--it should be mentioned, both consider the Anglian features to have

heen more prominent than the Saxon. When proceeding to define tribal

differences and crosses, the nasal forms will, with other features, be sub-

jected by the Committee to more minute examination.'

     The above facts having been sufiiciently ascertained, it was easy to
compare the skeleton features of the Round-barrow man and the Saxon

with profiles of living subjects in this and neighbouring countries pre-
sumably inhabited by similar populations. Whenever the osseous and

other features were found to correspond, at the same time that they

differed entirely from other equally well-marked types, it was assumed

that the characteristics belonged to distinct races.

In the following definitions the three main types in this country are

designated by capital letters, intended to be used as symbols when discuss-

ing racial crosses.

  --First, the Dolichocephalic Dark Type, A. The definition of the short,

narrow-headed race shown by Dr. Thurnam and Professor Boyd Dawkins

to have preceded the so-called Celts, and termed by them Iberian (^ the

Silurian of Professor RoUeston), is at present incomplete. The forehead,

the most important of the features as a cliaracteristic of race, and its form is very
accurately indicated by its bony framework ' {Jour. Antfirop. Inst, vol. x. p. 160)
Dr. Droca defines six forms.

nasal bones lon^ and straight;                                                                                               the lower                                                           jaw weak (Rolleston)                                                                                                   and the

hair and eyes dark. Statistics of the colour of the hair and eyes, collected

by Dr. Beddoe, show that this race exerted a much wider influence on the

Apopulation than is usually supposed.                                                                                                                                                            number of photographs, which,

it is believed, represent varieties of the type, have been placed on cards.

   --Second, the BrachicepJialic Fair Ti/pe, B. The principal character-

istics of this race consist in the prominence of the brow and supra-nasal

ridges ;                                         a  slightly  receding                                                       forehead                                                            sharply projecting nasal bones,
                                                                                                                                                                            ;

causing a high-bridged or arched nose, without undulation ; a long, oval

face ;  high                                        cheek-bones                                                         and  a  prominent                                                        fine  chin.  From Mr. Park
                                                                                                                     ;

Harrison's observations the lips of this type appear to be thin, and the

ear pear-shaped, with no proper lobe, the fossa being continuous.

The above features are found associated with light hair and eyes,

and a stature above the average.

This type includes Belgic, Cymric, and Danish varieties, which further

observation, the Committee believe, will in course of time enable them to

differentiate : as also the Anglian, Jutish, and Frisian types. They have
selected several portraits, which present common characteristics.

The definition of Type B agrees in all the main points with descrip-

tions given some years ago by Dr. Beddoe, Mr. David Mackintosh, and

Mr. Hector Maclean, as well as with Dr. RoUeston's deductions in the

appendix to ' British Barrows,'

  --Third, the Suh-Dolichocephalic Fair Type, C. The Committee believe

that the following is a correct definition of true Saxon features. Brows

smooth                                           forehead rounded                                                       and vertical ;                                                           nasal bones  short and straight
                                              ;

nose not arched, ending in more or less of a bulb; face elliptical, rounded;

cheek-bones broad ; chin rounded ; lower part of face wide ; eyes promi-

nent, in                                         colour blue or bluish-grey                                                                                                                   lips moulded ;  ears flat, with formed
                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

lobes ; face and frame well-covered. Height aboiit the average.

The definition accords with Schadow's pure German (Teutonic) type,

and with the Saxon type of Beddoe and Mackintosh.

 graphs from different counties to illustrate crossing.

Preliminary Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. K. INIeldola,

    Greneral Pitt-Rivers, and Mr. W. Cole, appointed to investi-
    gate the Ancient Earthiuork in Epping Forest, hnotvn as the

    Loughton Camp.

The earthwork known as the Loughton Camp (first identified by Mi'.

B. H. Cowper in 1872) is situated on an elevated plateau in Epping

Forest, about a mile N.W. of the village of Loughton. There is another
well-preserved earthwork in the Forest, known as Ambresbury Banks,

lying about 2^ miles due north of the present camp, and investigations
undertaken last year by the Essex Field Club showed that the Ambresbury
Banks entrenchment was of British or Romano-British construction (see
 ' Brit. Ass. Report,' 1881, p. 697). In order to carry out the systematic
investigations of these two camps, which had not been cut into before

the examination made last year, it was resolved to commence upon the
Loughton Camp as early as possible this year, and an appeal was made

to the Essex Field Club, of which the present Committee are all members,
in order to raise the necessary funds. Permission having been granted
by the Epping Forest Committee of the Corporation of London, the work

was commenced on May 29, and was continued until June 13. The mode

of working was similar to that employed at Ambresbury Banks,' and
consisted in cutting sections through the rampart and ditch in order to
expose the old surface line. With a view to facilitate the carrying on of
the necessarily tedious work of watching the removal of the earth, a sub-
Committee of the Essex Field Club was appointed to co-operate with the
present Committee, and one or more members of the joint-Committee
were present on every working day to watch the proceedings. Each
spadeful of earth was sifted on its removal, and carefully examined for
relics, the position of each object being entered as it was found on a

working section prepared by Mr. W. D'Oyley, the honorary Surveyor to

the Club. The first section was 12 feet in width, and its cutting involved
the removal of 150 cubic yards of earth. But few objects were found in

this cutting. On the old surface, nearly under the centre of the rampart,

two or three fragments of pottery, several flint ' flakes,' and pieces of char-
coal were turned up. The pottery is extremely rude, and consists of badly
burnt rough clay, containing quartz grains, and showing no traces of lathe
turning. The great amount of denudation which this earthwork has
experienced, owing to its exposed situation and the light character of the
soil, has caused the complete silting up of the ditch in most parts, and it
was found in this first section that the silting was so very similar in ap-

 pearance to the undisturbed earth, that the form of the ditch could not be

satisfactorily made out. This last circumstance, combined with the paucity

of the evidence obtained, determined the extension of the investigation,

and another cutting 7 feet wide was commenced on June 8. In this
second section no pottery was found, but numbers of flint flakes, and a
partially-finished flint celt, all on the old surface line, and buried well
beneath the rampart. Further evidence of human occupation in the way
of charcoal and burnt clay, marking the sites of fire-places, were also
found on the original surface.

     The evidence thus far obtained does not appear to the Committee
sufiiciently complete to enable it to form any conclusive oiDinion as to the
age of the earthworks, although the relics thus far found, conjoined with

the absence of all Roman remains, point to a very early, and most probably

prc-Roman, period. It is therefore proposed to continue the investiga-

tions, and we have to request that the present Committee be reappointed,
with the addition of the name of Mr. Worthington G. Smith. Full details

of the various objects found, with a description of the physical features

of the camp and its environment, together with a complete survey, will

be presented with the final Report.

     In conclusion; the Committee has to express its thanks to those mem-
bers of the Essex Field Club who have subscribed to the fund which has
enabled the investigation to be carried out, and especially to Mr. W.
D'Oyley of Loughton, who prepared the plans and sections for the use of

the explorers.

Second Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. Sclater, ]\Ir.

   Howard Saunders, aiid Mr. Thiselton-Dyer (Secretary), ap-

   pointed for the purpose of investigating the Naturcd History of
    Timor-laut.

By an oversight your Committee omitted to draw the sum of 501.
granted to them at the Swansea meeting of the Association. This o-rant

therefore lapsed, and your Committee have had nothing more at their

disposal than the lOOZ. voted by the General Committee at York.

   A communication was received from Mr. Forbes's I'epresentative in

London subsequent to the last meeting of the Association, in which the

following statement occurs :

' Mr. Forbes has been informed that the sending of collections to the

Association is a condition annexed to all such grants as that voted for

the Timor-laut expedition                                                                                                                    and as he could not fulfil such a condition he
                                                                                                                                          ;

feels compelled to postpone his expedition.'

This communication was considered by your Committee at a meeting

held November 17. It was felt that the contribution made by the

Association would go but a small way to cover Mr. Foibes's expenses

and that therefore any claim to the whole of the scientific results was not
Ain any way reasonable.
                                                                                                                                             communication was therefore made to Mr.

Forbes to the effect that the Committee would pay the lOOZ. in their

hands to Mr. Forbes ' upon condition of his undertaking to proceed to

Timor-laut and make collections. Of these collections, both zoological

and botanical, the first complete set is to be placed at the disposal of the

Committee. Of all other specimens Mr. Forbes is to retain uncontrolled
power of disposition.'

     This arrangement was accepted by Mr. Forbes by telegram on Feb-
ruary 21 of the present year ; and, as had been arranged with his repre-
sentative, the time being pressing, a credit for lOOL was telegraphed out

to him at a cost of 21. 14s. 8d.
     Subsequently the following letter, dated April 1882, was received

from Mr. Forbes :

                                                                                                                    ' Bat avia.

My -- my' dear Sir, I have deferred writing to you till all arrange-

ments for the Timor-laut expedition had been completed, and I ti-ust you

will pardon my seeming want of courtesy in not writing directly to your-

self before this.

' On arrival here at the beginning of the year from Sumatra, I at

once made application to the Government for the continuance of the

grant of the war vessel made to me by the late Governor-General, without

which it would have been almost impossible for me to have accepted the

Association's grant. Last year I was under the impression that vessels

belonging to certain Arabs went there evciy year. This I now find to be

erroneous. They do not go to Timor-laut itself, nor to any of the near

islands, nor is there any means of communication save from Amboina

in the boats used by the tortoise-shell gatherers, which could not well

take me and my baggage, nor bring back my botanical collections. I

--had to wait a very long time for the reply of the Governor- General in

Myfact, until March 12 or 13, when I telegraphed to London.  arrange-
--ments are now to leave here by the first steamer in fact, the first since
--my reply from the Government here for Amboina, where the Tagal is

now lying. I asked that the vessel should remain with me, but the

Admiral here cannot grant that, the full disposition of the steamer being

in the power of the Resident (Mr. Riedel), who, I have some hope, will

accompany me to the island. From the Gardens here I am taking-

Wardian cases; and while the vessel stays, if it be for a short time
only, I shall fill them, and have them sent to Buitenzorg to be estab-
lished before sending them home to Kew. Part of the duplicates must
remain here, both for the purpose of replacing such as die on the way to
London, and partly as the return to the Government for the use of the

Tagal. If the natives are too hostile, I may not be able to remain
entirely unprotected, but 1 believe they are very much more friendly
than is supposed, in which Dr. Machlucho Macleay, whom I had the
pleasure of meeting here recently on his way to Europe, confirms me. If

so, and if the Tagal cannot remain with me, I shall risk residence on the

island by myself and my company, and take what chance may pi'esent

itself of getting oS".

   --' The mere transport is excessively expensive from Batavia to

Amboina alone it is 401. Had it been necessary for me to find my own

way down to Timor-laut, lOOZ. would not have paid the expenses even of
landing me there.

     ' I have to thank you for telegraphing to the Bank here the credit of

1001., of which I was at once informed. When I have seen Mr. Riedel

at Amboina, I shall write you fully of the prospects of success.

' Believe me, yours very sincerely,

     From the following further communication from Mr. Forbes, which is
just to hand, it will be seen that he has reached Amboina; where he is,

however, delayed by unforeseen difficulties :

                                                                      'Amboina: May 8, 1882.

--' Dear Mr. Dyer, I must write you, though it can be only a line,

as the steamer from which we have just disembarked carries back the

mail for Europe, via Java.

    'I have just seen the Resident (Mr. Riedel), who has returned only

four days ago from Larat and Cera, where he has been placing Post-

myhonders (nominal officials only, I imagine), and to   great regret he

finds he cannot again return, the season being too far advanced for the

weak state of the engines on board the Tagal. There is, however, here a

very swift schooner, which I hope to be able to engage on moderate

terms to take me down.
    ' The reports of the islands are so good that I am exceedingly eager

to be away. The natives are not at all hostile, but require only careful
and, above all, trustful treatment. From what Mr. Riedel has told me,
their customs are very interesting indeed. The interior of the country

does not seem to be inhabited, and there are villages only along the

coast. The Resident has not been yet on the mainland of either of the

great islands of Timor-laut, but the chiefs of the southern part have

asked him to visit them. I wish, therefore, to get to Cera, and from that

mycross over to Selarve, the southern island. I shall, without fail, make

way  somehow  to  these  islands  by  the  very  first  ('Makassar  prahu
                                                                                     ')

opportunity, if the schooner here demands a too great price. I am very

hopeful that a bargain will be come to, however.

    ' I am hopeful that the British Association will see their way to

--continue to your Committee the grant of last year perhaps somewhat

increased.

' With regard,

            ' Believe me, yours very sincerely,

                                      (Signed) 'Henry 0. Forbes.'

     Your Committee have every reason to hope that Mr. Forbes, being
now fairly launched on his enterprise, will succeed eventually in reaching
Timor-laut. They therefore ask for their reappointment, and that a
further sum of lOOZ. may be placed at their disposal in aid of Mr. Forbes's
exploration. This sum would include a re-grant of the vote of 501. made

at Swansea, which has lapsed.

    Looking at the extreme interest which may be anticipated from

the results of Mr. Forbes's explorations in Timor-laut if carried to a
successful issue, your Committee cannot doubt that the aid they ask
from the Association will be more than amply justified.

280 KEPORT-- 1882.

     From the returns of height of adult males, as thus completed (num-
bering about 30,000), a map has been constructed by Mr. C. Roberts to

show the average stature of the adult male population (age from 23 to 50)
of the British Isles ; and an enlarged copy of this map, prepared at the
suggestion and expense of Mr. Haywood, will be published in the next
Report of the Committee. The higher statures are indicated in this

map by dark shades. Dr. Beddoe and Mr. Roberts call attention to the

following points of interest in this map, but they will be treated in gi'eater
detail in a future report.

   --Ethnohgij. The greatest stature is found in Scotland and the Norcli

of England, where the population is descended from the ancient Pictish
or Cimbro- British (Galloway), the Caledonii (Perthshire), the Anglo-
Danes and Norse (North and East Yorkshire, Cumberland, Westmoreland,
Lincoln and Nortolk), and the more purely Anglian tribes (Lothians,

Berwick and Northumberland). On the other hand, the shortest stature

is found in Wales, the Welsh border counties, and the South-West of
England, where the Iberian race is predominant. The counties inhabited
by men of more purely Saxon descent show a medium stature.

      (?eoZo(7//.--Allowing for the ethnological differences just mentioned,
the inhabitants of elevated districts possess -a greater stature than those

of alluvial plains. The river-valleys of the Severn, the Thames, the Dee
and Mersey, the Trent, and the fen district of Cambridge and Huntingdon
show a lower stature than the surrounding counties inhabited by persons

of a similar racial origin.

   --Climate. The stature of the inhabitants is greater in the northern

and colder than in the southern and warmer districts of the islands.

   --Sanitary Surroundinrjs. The counties which fringe the sea-coast pos-

sess a higher statui'e than those adjoining them but lying fui-ther inland.
The lower stature of the river valleys would seem to imply that such
situations are not favourable to physical development. The low position
of the West Riding of Yorkshire is due to the larger town population

included in the returns, and that of Durham to the larger mining pojiula-

--tion. The very low position of the home counties Hertford, Surrey, and
--Middlesex is probably due to their proximity to London. The more

vigorous men are attracted by higher wages, and the more feeble over-

 flow into those districts.

      Ireland is A'ery imperfectly represented by the Committee's returns.
      The Committee has prepared a series of tables from the returns in its
possession, but as these are not yet complete, and there are still some

important matters to be considered, the Committee requests that it may

be reappointed, with the view of completing this part of the Report next
year, and digesting and presenting the fresh materials in connection with

 those already laid before the Association.

      It is a duty which the Committee has pleasure in fulfilling to return
its best thanks to the observers, named in the foregoing lists, for the valu-
able information which they have furnished and also to express the

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

ON THE NATURAL HISTORY OF 80C0TRA.  281

Report of the Committee, consisting of Lieiit.-Col. Godwin-Austen,
   Dr. Gr. Hartlaub, Sir J. Hooker, Dr. GriiNTHER, Mr. Seebohm,

   and Mr. Sclater (Secretary), appointed for the purpose of
   investigating the Natural History of Socotra and the adjacent
   Highlands of Arabia and Somali Land.

The balance in hand from 1870-1 (Gl. 7s. lOd.), added to the 100/. granted
at the York meeting, together with the amount received up to the present

time by the sale of tlae duplicate specimens of birds and land shells, viz.,
171. 12-9. M., reduced by 7s. for postage, leaves a total balance in hand
of 1231. 13s. 2d. for any future work in Socotra or on the adjacent main-

land.

     Since the last report was presented, Professor I. Bay ley Balfour has
been working, whenever his other duties have permitted, at the extensive
botanical collection formed by him, to which has been added the plants
collected by Schweinfurth, who has since visited the island, and who has
placed the same most liberally at Professor Balfour's disposal. Some of the
preliminary diagnoses have been published, which show that the different
groups are very rich, and that there is a very considerable amount of

--work in the collection, which can only be brought out slowly. Professor

Balfour, writing on June 17, says : ' I ha\e a lot more diagnoses in press

just now, and hope in August or September to complete my work on the

Botany. This emeute in Egypt will, however, interfere, as Schweinfurth

will be unable to continue his communications, and 1 am waiting for a
lot of notes by him on many species. I onlj^ hope his collections will not
be destroyed, and as he has some of my specimens at present I am

somewhat anxious regarding their fate.' . . .
     The rock-specimens Collected by Professor Balfour have been worked

out by Professor Bonney, whose report on the subject was read before the

Royal Society at their last meeting of the session for 1881-2. He states

that the great limestone plateau, which forms so large a part of the
upland district of the island, is found, by the foraminifera present in the

rock, to be of Miocene age. This is seen to rest in many places upon a

floor of very ancient gneissic rock, bearing a general resemblance to the

most ancient rocks of North-Western Britain and other countries. The
Haggler mountains, forming the highest ground in the island, consist,
so far as is shown by the specimens brought, of granites poor in mica and

rich in felspar, bearing often a considerable resemblance to those of Sinai.

These are traversed by dykes of felsite and other igneous rocks. To the
south-east of this range is a tract occupied by red felsites and rhyolites,
with some agglomerates or conglomerates. The structure of some of the

former rocks renders it in the highest degree probable that they are ancient

lava-flows. They are anterior in date to the Miocene limestones. These
also are occasionally cut by basalts and perhaps by trachy tic rocks. In the

northern part of the island, beneath the limestone, is an argillite of un-
certain age, and there is probably some representative of the ' Nubian
sandstone.' It is, however, almost certain that for a long period anterior
to the Middle Tertiary, Socotra formed part of a land surface, and it is

quite possible that the summits of the Haggier mountains may not have

been even then submerged. If so, the flora, and perhaps the fauna, is

likely to have an exceptional interest.
282 REPORT-- 1882.

    As to a renewal of explorations, the Committee fear tliat Eastern
affairs make the outlook very unsatisfactory, since it would appear that
all through the East, in the vicinity of Aden especially, there is a very
hostile spirit rampant against Europeans. It is hoped that there may
soon be some definite settling of the excitement, but at present the Com-

mittee do not think that any plans for a future expedition can be made.
     The results of the Socotran exploration have been so successful and so

great, considering the small expenditure of money and time it has entailed,
that the Committee trust they may see the same kind of work extended.
They trust that the opportunity will not be lost of sending properly
trained naturalists into the mountainous regions of Eastern Africa, which
the despatch of an expedition by the Geographical Society now presents.
The scientific knowledge that would be accumulated by such explorers in
that lofty region would be of great interest in connection with the relations
of the fauna and flora of Socotra, and not of secondary importance to

purely geographical information.

     For the reasons given above the Committee do not ask for any
further grant at present.

Report of the Coikniittee, consisting of Dr. M. Foster, Dr. Pye-
    Smith, Professor Huxley, Dr. Carpenter, Dr. G-wyn Jeffreys,
   the late Professor F. M. Balfour, the late Sir C. Wyville
   Thomson, Professor Eay Lankester, Professor Allman, and Mr.
   Percy Sladen {Secretary), appointed for the purpose of aiding
    in the maintenance of the Scottish Zoological Station.

The Committee beg leave to report that, with the aid of the sum of 40Z.
voted last year, further investigations have been made by Mr. Romanes,
F.11.S., and Professor Cossar Ewart on the ' Locomotor System of the
Echinodermata.' The work of the station was carried on at Oban, where,
in addition to the ordinary forms abundant on the west coast, Antedon was

plentifully obtained foe examination.

     The investigators directed their attention

ON THE MIGRATION OF BIRDS.  283

Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. John Cordeaux, ]\lr.
    J. A. Harvie-Brown, Professor Newton, Mr. E. M. Barrington,

    Mr. A. Gr. More, Mr. T. Hardy, and Mr. P. M. C. Kermode,

    appointed for the purpose of obtaining (tuith the consent

    of the blaster and Brethren of the Trinity House, and of the
    Commissioners of Northern Lights) observations on the Migration
    of Birds at Lighthouses and Lightships, and of reporting on

    the same.

The General Report,' which comprises observations taken at all the chief

stations on the east and west coasts of England and Scotland, the coasts

of Ireland, Isle of Man, Channel Islands, Orkney and Shetland Isles, the

Faroes, Iceland, and Heligoland, has been unavoidably delayed in printing.

It will probably form a pamphlet of not less than 130 pages.

     With respect to the east and west coasts of England and Scotland
your Committee has again to report favourably of the observations
made along our shore-lines, and at the various lighthouse and light-
vessel stations, upon the migration of birds. In the northern parts of

these coasts the prevailing winds were westerly to north-westerly, but
from the entrance of the Firth of Forth southward easterly winds pre-
vailed. The south-east wind which brought over vast numbers of birds

as recorded at Isle of May and along the English coast, was also felfc

--locally at Pentland Skerries a much more northern station, and there

also numbers of birds were observed. The wave of migration this
season has been wide-spread upon the greater portions of our east coast-
line, but north of the Firth of Forth has been much more limited, more
compressed and normal. The general direction has been as before, from
E. to W., or S.E. to N.W". The greatest numerical returns on the east
coast of Scotland were from Isle of May, and the next greatest from Bell
Rock. North of the latter birds are reported much scarcer ; whilst
south of the former there has been a broad stream covering the whole of
our east English coast in comparatively equal proportions, and without

great throbs or 'rushes.'

      In spring the lines of migration are the same, the birds, however,

travelling from N.W. and W. to E. and S.E.^ The points at which birds

during the .spring migration have hitherto been observed to leave the
land, are situated in Forfarshire, on its south-east or east coast, and
between that point and the Bell Rock, in Scotland, and at Spurn Point
on the English coast.

     Further north as yet, we have no great mass of statistics to indicate

any other points of departure of spring migrants.^

wit in the spring is suggestive of an ancient coast-line which towards the end, or
perhaps subsequent to the last glacial epoch, swept east or north-eastward from
Holdemess to Southern Scandinavia and the mouth of the Baltic. It is a striking
fact, as mentioned by Mr. T. E. Mortimer in a paper read before the British Asso"-
ciation at York, 1881, that chalk boulders south of Hornsea contain black flints, which
are never found in the Yorkshire chalk, and which must have come from Norway .-
the flints north of Hornsea are more of the Yorkshire type, and were probably derived
from Flamborough Head.

    ' The Aberdeenshire coast has sent in no returns, and we cannot help thinking
284 BEPOET-- 1882.

     Eegarding the spring migration the Bell Rock and the Isle of May-
have hitherto returned the fullest schedules, and very considerable
numerical returns are already communicated for the 1882 report. Sand-
wich Terns pass every spring along the coast of Forfarshire, but shoot
off from the land again, and do not breed upon many of the suitable
places they pass over. Occasionally a pair of birds remain and breed, as
is shown by the nesting of this species on Inch Mickary in the Firth of
Forth in the past season, and on a previous occasion at the same place.
In the spring birds return on the same lines they travelled in autumn,

from N.W. and W. to E. and S.E. Migration has been earlier than in
1880, in many cases birds arriving in advance of recent years, this having

been notably the case with some of the Limicolce, such as have the
widest range, and whose breeding haunts are circumpolar, that is, confined
to lands surrounding the North Pole. Also in the case of the Anatidce,
which arrived fully a month before their average period. Spurn Point is

a great point of departure on the English coast, and we have seen that
Grey Plover, Knot, and Bar-tailed Godwits shoot off the land there,

because while they are annually seen there and southward of it in lai'ge
numbers and in full breeding dress, nowhere to the north of it do they
appear except in isolated cases. Still, the routes of spring migrants,
whilst they are usually more direct than those of autumn migrants, are
perhaps more difficult to trace, and our data are far from perfect yet.
This is in no small measure caused by the well-known fact amongst
ornithologists that it is always more difficult to fix dates of departures
than to fix those of arrivals.

     It may be said the general features of migration with reference to

linos of flight, time, height of travelling, favourable winds or otherwise,
circumstances of greatest casualties at lanterns of lightships and light-

houses, are the same as set forth in previous reports yet in 1881 we find
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

several important valuations from the normal phenomena consequent on
the direction of the wind and general character of the season. From the
commencement of August to the end of October the prevailing winds on
the English coast have been northei'ly and easterly, and as far north as

Isle of May and Bell Rock, whilst north of this latter point they have

been moi-e westerly, except at Pentland Skerries. The winter of 1881-82
has been remarkable for its high temperatures, no such uniformly mild
season having occurred for many years in this country, and the same has
been the case over the whole of Northern Europe north of latitude 50░
north. As might be expected, such an exceptional season has not been
without its effects upon our migrants. Fieldfares have crossed in very
limited numbers, and have everywhere been remarkably scarce in loca-
lities along our east coast-lines, and on the west coast absent. Large
numbers of birds which regularly arrive in the autumn, as the Greenfinch,
Chaffinch, Tree-sparrow, Snow Bunting, and others, and which remain for
a few days only and then pass on, have this year continued for many
weeks, and even months, resorting in iminense flocks to the stubbles,
where they found abundant supplies of food. Snow Buntings have been
considerably in excess of anything known for many years, the proportion
of old birds being not more than one in a hundred.

     Not the least remarkable was the influx of the larger Raptorial Birds

that there must be points of both arrival and departure in the north-east of this
county, as many rare species liave occurred there, judging from previous records by
Edwards and otliers.

ill a very broad fan all along our east coast, and extending from Forfar-

shire to the south of England, having previously crossed Heligoland on

September 22nd, and the tvro following days. From tiiis date, Ospreys,

Rough-legged Buzzards, and others of the Raptors swarmed at many

localities up to the end of October.

Hooded crows came with their usual regularity, almost to a day, the

great flight crossing Heligoland on the afternoon of October 17th, and also

on the 18th ; there was a corresponding arrival along the entire length

of the east coast of England on the night of the 17tl), or early morning

of the 18th, also on the 19th.

The season of 1881-82 will long be remembered by east coast orni-

thologists for the number of rare visitants which have appeared from

time to time, driven to westward of their ordinary lines by the prevailing

winds from N. and N.E. to S. and S.E. generally strong, and increasing

to a severe gale. The fact of ten Ospreys having been seen or procured,

has already been noticed ; there were two occurrences of Tengmalms Owl,
the Rustic Bunting at Spurn, Lapp Bunting at Tetney on the Lincolnshire

coast. White-spotted Bluethroats at Isle of May, and at Cley in Norfolk,

Glossy Ibis, five occurrences, Sabine's Gull, two on Norfolk coast, Kentish

Plover, Lincolnshire, Blue- winged Teal, Teesmouth, and many others.

Again, the occurrence on the east coast of such species as the Fork-

tailed Petrel, is explained by the local prevalence of westerly and northerly

winds in Scotland, carrying them overland from the west coast, and then

probably getting into the tracks of the easterly and northerly winds

which prevailed more to the southward. Records of the Fork-tailed

Petrel occur at Isle of May and several localities in England, as on the

Norfolk coast.

On the west coast the fullest numerical returns arc from stations for

Athe most part south of the Firth of Clyde.  rush of migrants in Sep-

tember, noticeable especially on the Isle of May, was observable also at

stations on the west coast sonth of the Firth of Clyde, and would thus

appear to be a general movement.

The occurrence of the white-spotted form of the Blue-thi-oated

Warbler,' after a succession of tremendous gales, culminating in the

dreadful hurricane of October 14th, seems to show clearly that the acts of

voluntary migration do not take place Ju following winds. This Bine-

throat was caught up and borne away tiolens volens, and our Mid-Atlantic

Notes in 1880 show similar abnormal results from the prevalence of

easterly gales.

The form of the migratory movement is affected by the prevailing

winds even more than the severity or otherwise of the weather.

The subject of heights of lanterns and their colours has not developed

as yet any fresh facts, but with the conviction that they will yet do so

the table of heights is retained. Actual experiment might set this part of
the subject at rest (vide General Remarks E.G. Scotland, Report 1880

pp. 19,20).

   A light- vessel or two placed in an equally favourable position with

--let ns say the Isle of May or the Bell Rock on the east coast, or at some

point north of Tweed, would, I believe, soon show us whether the pre-
ponderance of records south of Tweed is entirely due to old-established

lines of migration, or to the number of light-vessels on the English coast

--my' I am still convinced of the accuracy of
                                             identification of this bird

or pai'tly to both. It would, we think, assist in proving oi' disproving

theories of land-communication which have been advanced and disputed

by previous writers. At present we cannot positively state from our

present data whether an actual or only an apparent preponderance of birds

pass south of the Tweed in autumn. It appears, however, a little curious

to find a highway of migration by the Pentland Firth so much further

north than the stations mentioned. Writing from North Ronaldshay,

Orkney, Mr. Tnlloch remarks upon the usual scarcity there, and says

' they keep more direct for the mainland ; ' and he remarks also upon the

abundance of birds seen in September and November at Pentland Skerries,

where he was light- keeper for four years. He remarks especially on the

number of ' Mountain ' Thrushes, Blackbirds, Owls, Woodcocks, Wrens,

Robins, and Titmice which occur there whein the wind is from the east,

from which station there is a large numerical return this year. The isolated

position of the lights at Pentland Skerries, Caithness, combined with the

local prevalence of easterly winds, is perhaps sufficient to account for the

large mass of the records. At all events, the returns from this station

deserve special attention and study.

With a dry hot summer in Northern Europe, migration is always

earlier than in years of rain and low temperature, birds breeding sooner

in the former, and the nestlings, like all other young things, with dry

weather and sunshine developing more rapidly. Nothing is more re-

markable in the phenomena of migration than the punctuality with which

certain species return in the autumn, one species regularly taking prece-

dence of another, also in respect to the date of the arrival year after year.

In the Limicolce and Anatidce the date of the autumn migration varies

--often considerably from year to year ; but with some species as the

--Wheatear, Redstart, Fieldfare, Redwing, Hooded- Crow, Goldcrest, Wood-

cock, and others we may almost predict to a day the time of their first

appearance.

     The Period of the migration flight in the autumn of any particular

--genus or species is most probably referable to two causes : the first one

of temperature-- affecting the time of nesting ; the second is the period at

which the young arrive at maturity, or rather that period when they

throw oS" parental control or are thrown off themselves.

When able to act independently and procure food on their own account,

Wethey flock together and migrate in a body.      know that, with rare

exceptions, the young of the year migrate some weeks in advance of the

parent birds. Thus we can readily conceive the whole of the large raptorial

birds nesting about the same time over widely extending districts in

Northern Europe ; when all the many young arrive at this self-dependent

stage there would be a simultaneous movement ending in a universal

migratory rush. This period of self-dependence is arrived at much more

quickly in some birds than in others, for species like the Knot, Grey Plover,

Godwit, and Sanderling, nesting in very high latitudes, leave our shores

the last in the spring of any of the migrants, and their young are amongst
the first to return in autumn. The order of migration, more especially in

-- --connection with the shore birds, is the occurrence very early in autumn
   July or August of a few old birds in summer plumage, either barren,

or such, perhaps, as have been prevented nesting, then the young in large

flocks, and, some weeks subsequently, old birds.

The observations taken at the various stations, both on light-vessels

and from lighthouses, show a marked improvement on those of previous
                       ON THE MIGKATION OF BIRDS.                                                                                                                                                                                        287

years, and it will be found that tlie results of the investigation, as set forth

in detail in the General Report, are of sufficient value and scientific interest
to repay the Committee for the great outlay of time in arranging and tabu-

lating the various returns, as well as the very considerable expenditure

incurred over and above the grant of 161. placed at their disposal by the

Association.

With respect to the Irish coast, from the light-stations around which

returns have been this year received for the first time, printed schedules
were forwarded to 40 light-stations. Thirty stations replied by returning

the schedules wholly or partially filled with daily entries, or by sending

letters remarking on the absence of migratory birds, or on their general
movements.

The inquiry has the full concurrence and assistance of the Commis-

sioners of Irish Lights.

The returns have been as satisfactory as was anticipated for a first

attempt.  Some of the schedules were carefully filled                                                                                                                                                                                    and although others
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

contain very few entries, this is to be accounted for rather by the absence

of migratory birds than by any unwillingness on the part of the light-

keepers to assist us.

     The observers being untrained, names have been given to birds in a
few instances from which it is not easy to identify the species, and occa-

sionally there is reason to fear one species has been mistaken for another.

    Many of the stations complain of an unusual scarcity of birds last
autumn. By some observers this is attributed to its stormy character,

but it is also due no doubt to a general diminution of birds by reason of

the great numbers which perished here in the two previous severe

winters.

     The daily weather charts received from the Meteorological Office,
London, show the last quarter of 1881 to have been exceptional in the

--number and violence of its cyclonic disturbances strong westerly and

southerly winds prevailing.

     In order to see more easily the effect of the weather onthe movements
of birds, as well as to compare the migration of one species with that of
another on a given date, the entries from the schedules have been classified
in chronological order. The dates of migration can also be more readily

appreciated.

     As might be expected, more birds have been observed on our eastern

coast than elsewhere. The returns from the west coast are poor in species,

especially those from Kerry, Clare, Mayo, and Donegal. The Tuskar Rock

-- --seven miles to the S.E. of Wexford seems likely to prove the best

station on the Irish coast. Large numbers of birds passed, and hundreds
were killed.

   -- --Rockabill five miles from the Dublin coast may prove a good station.

     At the Copeland Islands, County Down, most species were noticed.

This is due perhaps to careful observation as well as situation.

     The general remarks from Black Rock lighthouse. County Mayo, one
of the ruost westerly as well as one of the most isolated Irish stations, are
interesting. It is desirable not to draw conclusions too hastily from the

statements of untrained observers.

    For the present we prefer to wait for a year or two before giving any

general results. Gradually the light-keepers will, we anticipate, take a

greater interest in this subject, and the schedules will be better and more

accurately filled, and we have hopes that then some trustworthy conclusions
288 REPOUT-- 1882.

may be arrived at, but it would be premature now to generalise from the

 data supplied to us.
      In conclusion -we take this opportunity of expressing our best thanks

to the Master and Elder Brethren of the Trinity House, the Commissioners
of Northern Lights, and the Commissioners of Irish Lights, for their
ready co-operation and assistance, through their officers and men, in the

 inquiry.

    We respectfully request our reappointment.

Report of the Coiiwiittee, consisting of the late Professor F. M.
    Balfour, Professor Newton, Professor Huxley, Mr. Sclater,
   Professor Kay Lankester, Professor Allman, Dr. M. Foster, and
    Mr. Percy Sladen (Secretary), appointed for the purpose of
    arranging for the occupation of a Table at the Zoological Station

    at Naples.

The Report upon the Zoological Station at Naples which your Committee

have the pleasure of presenting is of a highly satisfactory character.
The activity and prosperity of the institution continue in a course of

steady development, the number of naturalists who have visited the

Station during the past year shows a regular increase, and the published
results of the investigations undertaken by them stand in proportionate

ratio. No better proof than this could be fm^nished of the important

position held by the Station in relation to the progress of Zoological
science generally. In the ' Bericht ' for 1881, issued by Professor Dohrn,
attention is very naturally drawn to this increase of working visitors,

notwithstanding the fact that during the ten years which have now

elapsed since the foundation of the Station at Naples nearly a dozen
establishments with a similar object in view have sprung into existence
elsewhei-e. In no instance, however, can these kindred institutions be
said to rival, either in magnitude or in scope, the proportions of their
Neapolitan forerunner ; and a caution is very justly pronounced in the
report above mentioned against the indiscriminate multiplication of small
and ill-organised stations, as being a means of dissipating the pecuniary
support which is necessary for the maintenance and development of an

efficient establishment. From the fact that the gross income which can

be regarded as obtainable for such pui'poses is always of a comparatively

limited extent, any division of patronage necessarily tends to weaken the
power and to lessen the circle of usefulness, which the perfectly organised
and adequately supported establishment cannot fail to possess. This
warning is the outcome of no narrow-minded fear, but of a logical

inference ; for the conclusion is unquestionable that three or four large

and well- organised stations would be able to contribute more to the
advancement of science than a number of smaller institutions, each of
which, on account of the division of means and the consequent inadequate
endowment, would by itself be capable of doing comparatively little. The
erection of numerous stations on coasts which are neither extensive nor
diversified becomes on this account extravagant, as -well as detrimental to
prosperity and success. According to the scheme of Dr. Dohrn, the dis-

be devised for enabling naturalists to visit and to avail themselves of the

opportunity of investigating unknown districts at distant stations. Upon

such a basis it is not too much to say that Zoological Stations would

become the recognised centres from whence the unsolved problems of

Zoological Science might be appi'oached with every prospect of successful

solution. It has always been the aim of the Directorate of the Station at

Naples to develop an organisation which would afford a saving to the

working naturalist of the three important factors of time, space, and

money. The amount of success which is obtainable in this endeavour is

directly proportionate to the amount of assistance and co-operation

received; and hence it follows as a consequence that the greater the

patronage and support, the more speedily and the more perfectly will

this object be attained.                                                                                                            In the management of the

well before the public, have taken a place in the front rank of scientific

literature ; and each of the series is an undertaking worthy of the sup-

port of all biologists. It is unnecessary in the present place to do more

than report that the following is the state of progress of the respective

publications :

1. Of the ' Fauna und Flora des Golfes von Neapel,' four monographs

have already been issued. Monographs by Dr. Paul Mayer on the

Caprellidfe, and by Dr. Grussi on the Sagittte, are in the press ; and
succeeding monographs by Dr. Spengel on Balanoglossus, by Baron

Valiante on the Cystosirae, by Dr. Andres on the Actinife, and by Dr. Lang

on the PlanarisB, are in preparation. There are at present 260 subscribers

--for the ' Fauna und Flora ' monographs a number which cannot fail to

be considerably augmented so soon as the character of the works already

published is more widely known.

2. Of the ' Mittheilungen aus der Zoologischen Station,' vol. iii.

by Berthold on the Bathymetrical Distribution of the Algse of Naples,

and by Mayer on  Fig                                                            Insects                                   and  the  latter  part,  papers  by "Whitman

in reporting that the British Association Table has been almost con-

290 REPORT-- 1882.

       I. Report on the Occupation of the Table hy Mr. PatricJc Gedcles.

     I reached Naples on the Stli of October, 1881, and left on the 14th of

November. My object was to determine the nature and functions of the

' yellow cells ' of Radiolarians and Ccelenterates ; and more especially to

--test the hypothesis of their algal nature emitted by Cienkowski, and

adopted by the brothers Hertwig, Korotneff", Bi'andt, and other naturalists.

I believe I may say that the result was completely successful ; but as full

details of my observations and experiments are now published in a paper
* On the Nature and Functions of the " Tellow Cells " of Radiolarians

and Co3lenterates ' in the ' Proceedings ' of the Royal Society of Edinburgh

for 1881-82, I may refer to that publication.

    I have only, therefore, to express my most sincere thanks to the Com-

mittee for the use of their table.

     II. Beport on the Occupation of the Tahle hy Mr. A. G. Bourne.

"When I obtained permission to occupy the table from January 1 until

April 17, I did so chiefly with the intention of working at the minute

anatomy and histology of the marine leeches Pontobdella and Branchel-

lion. During the past two years I have been working, as opportunity

ofiered, at the comparative histology of the series of Hirudinean genera.

Although every effort was made on the part of the Station, the material

was  not  so  abundant as  I could have  wished                                    Pontobclellce were faii'ly
                                                                                ;

numerous, especially towards the latter part of my stay ; but of Branchel-

--lion only three or four specimens came to hand the B. torpedinis of

Savigny.

The results which I obtained in this work I shall publish in connection

with a series of papers on the comparative histology of the Hirudinea.

While some of these are only confirmations and enlargements of the views

put forward by Leydig, De Quatrefages, and Vaillant, some ai'e at variance

with these views, and others entirely new.

    Up to the time of writing this Report I have been unable to complete

their working out, and so must refrain from detailing them here.

     1 further occupied myself with an investigation of the structure and

function of the papillaa found on the ventral surface of the body in Poly-

noina, the ' inferior tubercle ' of Huxley, which Grnbe thought ruight

serve as a genital duct.

     Surprisingly enough, this tubercle has been as a rule overlooked by

systematic workers at the group. I have been enabled to satisfy myself

completely that it is the terminal portion of a nephridial duct, and by

means of transverse sections to make out the structure of the nephridium.

When the body is distended with genital products, these are forced into the

tubercles and distend them, but they lie between the wall of the nephridial

duct and that of the tubercle, and do not pass to the exterior of this

region ; this they doubtless do by a splitting of the body-wall in some
region. Such a method also obtains in other annelids, and is certainly

the rule in the Archi-annelida. I have observed that in many species

the ' overlapping ' or ' non-meeting ' condition of the elytrse is due to the

state of such distension.

    My sections also show the method of attachment of the elytrse, their

structure, as also that of the basal portion of the notopodial and neuro-
          ON THE ZOOLOGICAL STATION AT NAPLES.                                                                                            291

podial cim, whicli contain peculiar cells, no doubt sensory in function.

The supra-oesophageal ganglion, or brain, fills the prostomium and appears

to supply the prostomial tentacles and palps (' Fiihlercirren ' of Grube).

In addition, I collected the various members of the group which appeared

myduring  stay,  and hope to revise Claparade's  list of the                                               same                           his
                                                                                                                                       ;

P. Ch'uhiana is certainly synonymous with the Lepidonotus clava of Mon-

tagu, common on the coast of South Devon, while he entirely omits to

mention P. (^Lepidasthemia, Mgu.) elegans, Grube, =F. lampropthalma,

Marenzeller. I have found one species which I believe to be new.

I was anxious to trace the development of some directly developing

Medusae Pelagia, Carmarina, or other ; neither Haeckel, Fol, nor Metsch-

nikoff had been able to demonstrate in Carmarina the exact method of

formation of the sub-umbral cavity, &c., which I had hoped to do, but did

not obtain a single egg ; and while, in the case of Pelagia, I was able to

confirm Kowalesky's account of the segmentation, my departure prevented

me from carrying the developmental history further than the formation of

the four-sided pyramidal gastrula.

Further, I dissected specimens of the large species o?Aphjsia, common

at Naples, with a view of determining the anatomy of the renal organ.

The so-called poison-gland of Delia Chiaje, a grape-like organ lying to the

right of Spengel's olfactory organ, has nothing to do with it ; the glands

which secrete the pigment are scattered follicles, lying in the substance of

the free edge of the mantle, and opening on its under surface. The so-

called triangular gland and renal organ, which are only two parts of the

same organ, lie near the attachment of this flap ; the external aperture of
the organ is near the anterior attachment of the gill. The renal epithelium

lines a much plicated continuous membrane, and the renal sac communi-

cates, as has already been shown to be the case in other gastropods, with

the pericardial cavity.

And lastly, at the request of Professor E. Ray Lankester, I have

verified his observations on the development of autoplasts in the egg of

Loligo, the existence of which has lately been denied by Ussow.

III. Report on the Occupation of the Tahle hy Mr. Franh E. Beddard.

I occupied the British Association table from April 24 to June 9.

Besides endeavouring to obtain a general acquaintance with the fauna of

the coast, I devoted myself to a study of the histology of the Pedicellariae

of certain echinoderms, in continuation of an investigation recently

published in the ' Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.'

Although, unfortunately, my work was much interfered with by indis-

position, which even obliged me to leave Naples for Ischia for a short

time,  I was able to collect a  considerable  amount of  material                                          and hope
                                                                                                        ;

to complete and publish my observations during the coming winter.

I wish to return my most sincere thanks to the Committee for their

kindness in allowing me to use the table.

Before leaving Palestine he received notice from His Excellency the British

Ambassador that the new firman had been finally approved by the

Minister of Public Instruction, and submitted by him to the Porte for

confirmation. He has brought home with him the finished map, on the

scale of 1 inch to the mile, of 500 square miles, together with many

new photographs taken by Lieutenant Mantell, and volumes of notes,

special plans, drawings, &c. He is now occupied in working up for

publication the notes and information collected by him. This will

occupy him about five months.

The results of this campaign have been, among other things, the dis-

covery of a vast number of cromlechs and rude stone monuments. Many

of them had been discovered previously by Canon Tristram, but Captain

Conder has established the fact that this part of Moab was a great centre

of the form of religious worship of which these monuments are the

remains. He suggests that among them are the altars of Balak. He has

--proposed identifications for Baal Peor, the Field of Zophim, the Ascent of

Luhith, Jazer, Sibmah, and Minnith six Biblical places previously un-

known                                    he has collected a great quantity of Arab folk-lore, with tribe
                                      ;

marks and traditions ; he has found a most remarkable building of

Persian character at Amman ; and he has made a collection of sketches

and plans of the greatest value. In fact, the work done on the east of the

Jordan will be found to be in every way equal to that done in the west and

already published. He has also made numerous geological observations.

But besides the survey. Captain Conder found time to do a great deal of

work on this side of the river. He discovered Kadesh, the ancient capital

of the Hittites ; he has measured and planned the Siloam tunnel, and

made a copy of the inscription ; and he has discovered and planned what
he suggests may be nothing less than the real Holy Sepulchre.

It is hoped that the pai-ty may again before long take the field, with-

out fear of obstruction or opposition, in a work which has no political

significance, but is of extraordinary interest to all who are interested in

the lands and people of the Bible.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Leone Levi,
    Mr. Stephen Bourne, Dr. Hancock, the late Sir Antonio Brady,

    the late Professor Jevons, Mr. F. P. Fellows, Mr. E. J.
    Watherston, Mr. Pearson Hill, Mr. G-eorge Baden Powell,

   and Mr. Jeremiah Head, appointed for the purpose of con-
   tinuing the inquiry into and completing the report upon the
   Appropriation of Wages and other sources of income, and con-

   sidering hotu far it is consonant ivith the economic progress of

   the United Kingdom. Drawn up by Professor Leone Levi.

The question, whether or not, or how far, the present appropriation of
wages and other sources of income is consonant with the economic

progress of the people of the United Kingdom, is one of considerable
298 REPORT--1882.

importance, the consumption of wealtla forming one of the great divisions
of political economy, though it has received, but scanty attention from

English writers on that science. The question, indeed, does not admit of

exact statistical analysis, the personal expenditure of the people being of

an elastic character, and depending, in a great measure, on the varying
wants of man, which seem to increase with the power of satisfying them.
It is easy to say that the wages and other sources of income are appro-
priated in accordance with the economic progress of the people in pro-
portion as they are expended in articles directed to maintain, or to add to,
the productive forces of the nation, but there remains the grave difficulty
to define what is necessary for such maintenance or addition, and upon

this the opinions of men differ considerably.

     Man's real wants are very few. ' Allow not nature more than nature
needs ; man's life is cheap as beasts'.' But increasing civilisation pro-

duces increasing wants. It is not only our physical wants that we have
to satisfy, but our moral and intellectual wants. The boundaiy-line
between the necessary and the luxurious cannot well be marked. Luxury

is a relative term. It has been defined as the use of the superfluous but
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

what is superfluous in one state of society, or to one class in society, may

be necessary in another state or to another class. Tea, sugar, wheaten
bread, meat, and even the education of children, were accounted as super-

fluities in England years ago. They are now necessaries, even to working
men. Luxury does not necessarily consist of whatever is costly. The

most costly things are often the most economical. "Wants differ greatly.

A man of letters may find it necessary to possess a well-stored library

a man of taste, an artist, will require works of art ; a person of position
and rank will need a residence suited to his condition. What is necessary
to one who spends a life of labour and industry may be useless to another
who indulges in dolce far niente. For the performance of intellectual,

and even manual, labour of the highest order, comforts and conveniences

are needed which may appear luxuries and superfluities to those incapable

of such efibrts.

     There is a considerable diflerence, however, between what is expended
in pure luxuries, such as ornaments and legitimate pleasures, and what is
expended in dissipation, vice, or in the absolute destruction of wealth.
Ornaments and legitimate pleasure may, both directly and indirectly,

promote production, as an occasional amusement may lighten the mind,
and make it the better fitted for close application ; but dissipation and

vice are directly antagonistic to the production and maintenance of
wealth. Luxury manifests itself in the prodigal use of jewellery, the ex-

pensiveness of entertainments, the richness of female apparel, the gorgeous-
ness of Court pageantry, and the magnificence of household furniture

and appointments. Luxury, it has been said, is the indigenous product
of monarchies, monarchs having always found it useful to require a high
etiquette and an imposing external to maintain power. But luxuiy

of this nature is not confined to Courts. It is the child of wealth and

pomp among the higher classes, greedily followed and copied by the
lower. Luxury of such a character is condemned by moralists as intended
to satisfy vanity and to engender egoism and ostentation. What political
economy especially condemns is whatever is hurtful to the productive
forces of the nation. An inordinate and wasteful indulgence in alcoholic
drinks and tobacco in England, in the same manner as in opium in China
and absinthe in Prance, is condemned by economic science because it
ON THE APPROPRIATION OF WAGES, ETC.  299

paralyses the productive forces of the nation. And so is war, with all its

incidents ; the maintenance of large armies and navies, the destruction

of property, and the exhaustion of capital in every form.
     In the report laid before the Association meeting at York last year

many valuable facts were presented illustrative of the personal expendi-
ture of the people of the United Kingdom derived from the quantities of

produce and manufacture annually consumed and valued at import and
retail prices, both exclusive and inclusive of import and excise duties,
as well as of expenses and profits of distribution. Though, as your Com-
mittee have already stated, the question at issue is not capable of correct
statistical analysis, and the values are, at best, estimates, the facts collected

may be taken as sufficiently near the truth. For the purpose of this

calculation the population was taken at 25,200,000. In estimatmg the
income the number of paupers, sick and old, must be considered, but it
should be remembered that only a small proportion of paupers are able-
bodied, and that these are in the great majority not idlers, but persons
earning insufficient wages, the low rates of which contribute to lower the
estimated earnings for the whole number. The broad results, in their

aggregate, were that the gross or personal expenditure of the people may

be░taken to amount to about 870,000,000Z., and the net, or national,

to about 684,700,000L

    Upon these figures some emendations are required. The house-rent,

deduced from the amount assessed to the Inhabited House duty, is

made on the full value, and not on four-fifths, as for the poor-rate as

Wepreviously calculated.  must, therefore, remove the 8,000, 000Z._ added

for that purpose. The amount of house-rent in Ireland may be estimated

from the value of messuages charged to income-tax, which was 2,200,000Z.

Add twenty per cent, to that amount, which is too low according

to Griffiths' valuation, to arrive at the present rate, viz. 800,000Z.,

and take two-thirds of the whole amount, so as to exclude shops,
&c., we obtain the amount of house-rent in Ireland, 2,700,000L Hence

the total gross or personal expenditure in house-rent may safely be taken

at 71,700,OO0Z. and the net at 67,400,000Z. The attention of the Com-

mittee has been called to the large expenditure in locomotion, apart from

that included under the heading of amusements. It is difficult, however,

to distinguish the personal from the business expenditure in locomotion.

The gross receipts from passenger traffic on the railways amounted to
26,000,000L ; add 6,000,000Z. for tramways, cabs, and omnibuses, and we

have a total of 30,000,OOOL But of this amount only one-fourth can be

taken as representing the personal expenditure, or about 7,500,000Z., only

40 per cent, of which would represent the real expenditure in the main-

tenance of way, locomotive power, horses, &c., or 3,000,OOOZ.^ Another
omission has been noted, viz., the expenditure on domestic service. Such

expenditure is, however, included in the cost of the articles which servants

consume, the remainder constituting a simple transfer from one class to

another. The same observation will apply to other branches of expendi-

ture, as the medical, lawyers' fees, &c.

     Making the necessary alterations, the total expenditure is as follows :

facts, well ascertained, the following may be taken as an approximate

division of the expenditure :

further productioc, in the other the object produced is either useless or

utterly -nasted. What is expended productively is never consumed. It
reproduces itself again and again. What is expended unproductively is

lost. It is the same whether the expenditure is public or private. It

is the same whether it is devoted to maintain men or to maintain things.
It is the same whether the money is lent to the home Government or to
foreign countries. Let money be lent to be expended in wars, it is utterly
wasted. Let money be judiciously expended for railways or canals,

or for drainage or other productive purpose, and it remains a source of
wealth and prosperity. Your Committee have limited their observations
to the appropriation of wages and other income. They might have illus-

trated the question with the employment of the human forces and with the
appropriation of time, the most valuable of human property. Idle habits
and an unnecessary number of holidays likewise restrict the productive
power of the nation, and rob the same of much of its resources. England
labours much and she expends liberally. It is the duty of the nation
to use aright its hard-won gains, so that they may minister to the comfort
and aiBuence of the people.

      In a paper laid before Parliament in 1857 on the consumption of tea

and sugar in the United Kingdom (184, Sess. 2) there is a report

 by Sir Charles Pressly, of the Inland Revenue, giving the result of an
inquiry made through the excise officers into the proportionate quantities
 of tea and sugar consumed by the upper, middle, and lower classes in
 England and Scotland respectively, which were as follows :

Report of the Committee, consisting- of IMr. James Heywood,
   Mr, William Shaen, Mr. Stephen Bourne, Mr. Kobekt Wil-

   kinson, the Eev. W. Delany, Professor N. Stoky Maskelyne,

   Dr. SiLVANUS P. Thompson, Miss Lydia E. Beckbe, Sir John

   Lubbock, Professor A. W. Williamson, ]Mrs. Augusta -Webster,
   Dr. H. W. Crosskey, Professor RoscOE, Professor Gr. Carey
   Foster, and Dr. J. H. Gladstone, {Secretary), appointed to
   luatch and report on the %vorldngs of the propjosed revised Neiv
   Code, and of other legislation affecting the teaching of Science

   in Elementary Schools.

When this Committee was reappointed at York, it was with a special

view to the important changes which it was expected the Government
would naake in the Education Code. In the postscript to their previous
report, great satisfaction was expressed at the general scope of the
' proposals' that had just been submitted to Parliament, but it was urged
that the knowledge of nature should be more effectually encouraged as a

class subject.

    On assembling in the autumn, your Committee added to their number
the Rev. H. W. Crosskey of Birmingham, and Professor Roscoe of

Manchester, and, subsequently. Professor G. Carey Foster of London.

     At the first meeting it was determined to enter into communication

with Mr. Mundella, the Vice-President of the Committee of Council on
Education, but the serious illness of that gentleman caused a delay. The

Secretary, however, eventually saw him at his own house, and found him
desirous of receiving the views of the Committee by deputation. As this
was a step which your Committee felt themselves not justified in taking
unless through the governing body of the Association itself, they drew
up a series of resolutions, and submitted them to the Council, with the

request that that body should appoint a deputation to urge their views.
     These resolutions were passed by the Council, with the addition of

that numbered YII. They were as follows :
     I. That Clauses 9 (3), 20, 26, and the Standard work in Geography

(pp. 6 and 7) be ;i[iproved.
     II. That the :irr:ingements involved in Clauses 18, 19, 21, 23, and 27

--be subject to revision on the following grounds :

     a. That Clauses 19 and 21, read together, will practically exclude
Elementary Science teaching in the Lower Division, as Geography will be
almost always cluism by teachers as the second subject.

     h. That placing Standard IV. in the Lower instead of the Upper

Division will restrict the choice of Class-subjects to be taught in that
Standard, and altogether exclude the teaching of any of the Specific

subjects.

      c. That, taking all these Clauses as they stand, there will practically
be a cessation in the teaching of Elementary Science from the time of

leaving the Infant School (Clause 9 (3) ), till entering the Upper
Division (Clauses 23 and 27).

     It is therefore recommended that Clause 21 be left out ; and that
Clause 19 be so modified as to permit of the ordinary Class Grant being

                                              X2
 308 REPORT-- 1 882.

paid if the children pass in any one or two of the Class-subjects, and an

additional Grant if three be taken.
      III. That the list of Specific subjects (Clause 25) should include

Elementary Physics, and the fundamental facts of Chemistry ; and the
word ' Geometry ' should be used instead of ' Euclid.'

     IV. That Clause 29 be left out, inasmuch as Domestic Economy in-

cludes the principles of alimentation, sanitation, &c.

     V. That the teaching of Specific as well as Class-subjects in Night
Schools should be provided for in Clause 30.

     VI. That the Standard work in Elementary Science (pp. 6 and 7)

needs rearranging :

     The division (a) should generally include plants as well as animals.
     The divisions (6) and (c) should be welded together, and more pro-

gressively arranged.

     VII. That the Science programme should be regarded as a sugges-
tion, but not necessarily as an inevitable arrangement.

     VIII. That the Pupil Teachers' course (p. 11) should provide for the
study by them of Elementary Science, seeing that they will in all pro-
bability be required to give Object lessons, or to teach Elementary

Science in the Schools, and to attend science classes at College.

   A deputation was appointed to present the memorial, but so many

other public bodies were approaching the Education Department on the

subject of the New Code, that Lord Spencer was unable to find time to

receive it, and the memorial was sent in the usual way. Dr. Gladstone,
however, as one of a deputation from the London, Birmingham, and
other School Boards, had an opportunity of urging the claims of
Science, and of mentioning the special wishes of the British Association.
Nothing could be more distinct than the assurance of both Lord Spencer
and Mr. Mundella as to their desire to introduce the teaching of
Elementary Science as far as circumstances would permit.

     Recommendations somewhat similar to those of the British Associa-
tion were made, not only by the above School Boards, but also by a
Conference of leading educationists on Code Reform, and by the British

and Foreign School Society.

    When the New Code was laid on the table of the House, on March 6,.

it appeared that some of these recommendations had been adopted, and
that all the clauses in the ' Proposals ' which were approved by your

Committee had been retained.
     The proposals thus retained are as follows :
     In Infant Schools the merit grant will be dependent upon the report

of the Inspector, who will have to take into consideration the provision
made for ' simple lessons on objects, and on the phenomena of nature and
of common life.'

     The leading facts of Physical Geography will be taught, not, as before,
as an optional specific subject for the high standards, but as a part of
Geography, which is a class-subject for the children in all the standards.

     The teaching of the principles of Agriculture as a specific subject is,

for the first time, recognised.

     The recommendations adopted are as follows :
      ' Chemistry ' and 'Physics ' in the two branches of ' sound, hght, and
heat,' and of ' electricity and magnetism,' have been added to the list of
sciences capable of being taken up as soecific subjects by children in
Standards V., VI., and VIT.
       ON THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE IN ELEMENTABT SCHOOLS. 309

The scientific specific subjects are admitted for the first time into the

curriculum of Evening Schools.

The Department has considerably modified its scheme as to ' Elemen-

tary Science ' as a class-subject ; this ' may be framed so as to lead the

scholars in Standards I. to IV. up to one of the scientific specific sub-

jects ; ' but a scheme is also given -which ' may be taken as a guide

suggesting heads for a sufficient number of lessons in each standard.'

In the scheme plants are recognised as fully as animals, and the incon-

sistencies that occurred in the original scheme are avoided.

The Department has not, however, acceded to other recommendations

of your Committee. There are still retained such restrictions as will

greatly hinder the introduction of this elementary science as a class

subject. Domestic Economy has lost its preference as a specific subject

in girls' schools. Euclid is still enforced as the handbook of geometry.

There is no provision for the examination of pupil- teachers by Her

Majesty's Inspector in any branch of natural science, excepting that

geography is made to include a good deal of physical knowledge.

     Tour Committee having been informed that Sir John Lubbock in-
tended to move in Parliament that it was desirable to allow children to

be presented for examination in any of the recognised class-subjects,

passed a resolution ofiering him ' their support in asking that the three

class-subjects of Schedule II. of the New Code, viz., English, Geography,

and Elementary Science, should be placed on the same footing.' Sir
John Lubbock, in his speech, referred to the views of the British Asso-

ciation on this point ; the debate which ensued was very favourable to

the claims of Elementary Science, and the Vice-President promised to

give the subject further consideration, and to ' submit it to the Council of

Her Majesty's Inspectors and the able men who assisted him in framing

the Code, and, if it was possible, he should be happy to yield to the

wishes which had been expressed.' ^

    Many of the Elementary Schools of this country are now working
under the New Code, and before the month of May, 1883, they will all be

in that condition. In that month also, the Government inspection under

this Code will commence, and it will be possible to ascertain many

points of interest, such as (1) the quality of the object-lessons in the

Infant Schools ; (2) how far the proposed improvements in the teaching of

geography are                                carried  out   in  practice                                      (3)  to what  extent  Elementary
                                                                                                           ;

Science is taken up as a class- subject, and whether the teachers generally

take it up as an introduction to the scientific specific subjects, or continue

it as a class-subject throughout the school ; and, if so, whether they have

adopted some fuller scheme than that suggested in the Second Schedule

(4) whether the discontinuance of the teaching of specific subjects in

Standard IV. is really a gain or a loss to science.

Your Committee, if reappointed, propose to obtain information on

these  points                                and  to  draw  the  attention of the                                  Council to any matters
                                          ;

that may be necessary in connection with the working of the Code, or in

respect of any future alterations.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Sir Frederick Bramwell
   {Secretary), Professor A. W. Williamson, Professor Sir William
   Thomson, ]Mi-, St. John Vincent Day, Dr. C. W. Siemens, Mr. C.
   W. Merrifield, Dr. Neilson Hancock, Mr. F. A. Abel, Captain
   Douglas G-alton, Mr. E. H. Carbutt, Mr. E. Macrory, Mr. H.
   Trueman Wood, Mr. W. H. Barlow, and Mr. A. T. Atchison,
   appointed for the purpose of tuatching and repjorting to the
   Council on Patent Legislation.

The Committee have no actual progress in Patent Legislation to report.
The Bill promised in the Queen's Speech, and, as was stated by Mr.
Chamberlain, to be prepared by the Board of Trade, was not even intro-

duced.

    Two Bills for the reform of the Patent Law were brouglit in during

the Session by private members. One of these was by Mr. Anderson,
and was generally similar to the Bills brought in by the same gentleman
in 1880 and in 1881 (see Ф B. A. Eeports,' 1880, p. 318, and 1881, p. 222),
but contains one important alteration. It provides an examination into

the novelty of the invention, with the object apparently of giving friendly
advice to the patentee. Mr. Anderson has also materially modified in this
year's Bill the schedule of fees to be paid. This Bill was only read a first

time.

     The second of the two Bills was the one prepared by the Society of
Arts, and fully described in the last report of this Committee (see ' B. A.
Report,' 1881, p. 222). It was introduced by Sir John Lubbock, Mr.

W. H. Smith, and Mr. J. C. Lawrance, Q.C. It was read a first time on

March 15, and a second time on April 28, Sir John Lubbock stating, on
the latter occasion, that should the House assent to the second reading of
the Bill, he would defer further action, in order to move that the Bill
should be referred to the same Committee to which it was understood the
Government Patent Bill, when introduced, would be referred. As above
stated, the Government measure never saw the light at all, and conse-
quently no further progress was made with the Society of Arts Bill. The

Council of that Society announce in their annual report that they will
endeavour to bring the Bill forward again next year.

      Most of the provisions of the Bill as introduced are identical with
those of the original draft, an abstract of which was given in the report
of this Committee last year. Consequent, however, upon the public dis-
cussion of the Bill, the Society of Arts made certain alterations in some
of their original proposals. The fees were slightly reduced, and the
definition of ' subject-matter ' was modified. The most important change,
however, referred to the proposed method of trying Patent actions. The
new Court, which the Bill as first drafted set up for this purpose, dis-
appeared from the Bill in its final shape, and in place of this provision was
inserted one by which the Commissioners of Patents (to be appointed
under the Bill) would be empowered to act as assessors, or as referees,
or as ai'bitrators, under certain specified conditions.

     It may be worth noting that the Bill had the advantage of being

introduced by the President of the Association, while the President-elect

    The Committee request that they may be reappointed, and that the
grant made to them in 1880 of 5?. may be renewed.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Sir Joseph Whitworth,

   Dr. C. W. Siemens, Sir Frederick Bramwell, Mr. A. Stroh,
   Mr. Beck, Mr. W. H. Preece, Mr. E. Crompton, Mr. E. Kigg,
   Mr.' A. Le Neve Foster, Mr. Latimer Clark, Mr. Buckney, and
   Mr. H. Trueman Wood (Secretary), appointed for the purpose

   of determining a Gauge for the manufacture of the various
   small screius used in Telegraphic and Electrical Apparatus, in
   Glockiuork, and for other analogous purposes.

1. This Committee was formed by the General Committee of the British
Association assembled at York in August and September, 1881, for the
purpose of determining a gauge for the manufacture of the various small
screws used in telegraphic and electrical apparatus, in clockwork, and

for other analogous purposes.

     2. At that meeting a paper was read by Mr. Preece pointing out the
desirability of establishing such a gauge. Although the Whitworth
gauge is almost invariably adopted for the bolts and screws used in mill-
work and engineering in England, no general system has been hitherto
applied to the smaller screws used either in clockwork, philosophical in-
strument work, or in the numerous practical applications of electricity

that are now rapidly becoming so important. In fact, at the present time
gauges and screw plates almost equal in number the makers engaged in
the trade. One instance was brought to the attention of the Committee
by a manufacturer who had to execute an order for railway signal appa-
ratus in accordance with three sample instruments containing among
them twenty-one screws of different threads, not one of which happened to
be in use in his shop. There is now no recognised form of thread, no

--specified number of threads per inch in fact, no generally accepted gauge

based on practice and experience. Great inconvenience is felt in providing
for repairs, which are in consequence more costly and less efficient.

     The employment of some coherent and uniform system is manifestly
required. It not only would render repairs easier, speedier, and cheaper,
but it would introduce interchangeability of parts, and further the exten-
sion of piecework ; and it would reduce the equipment of workshops with
special and costly tools.

     3. The subject of uniformity in screws has been very warmly taken
up by the Societe des Arts de Geneve, which appointed a Committee
in December 187G, who after assiduous labours issued a repoi't in 1878.
The system proposed by them has been very fully described by Professor
Thury in two pamphlets published in Geneva.' The Committee collected
numerous screws of all sizes from matiy factories, measured them care-

fully, tabulated their several dimensions, and plotted the results by the
ordinary method of linear co-ordinates. They determined the mathe-
matical equations to curves that most closely corresponded with the
ratios of diameter to pitch thus found to have been employed in practice,

and adopted the one which most nearly represented the mean average

proportions of the screws in use at various shops and in different countries.
     The Swiss Committee took 1 millimetre pitch as the basis of their

system. It was agreed that such a pitch was best adapted to a screw
having a diameter of 6 millimetres. The form of thread adopted was
triangular, the angle made by producing the two sides being approximately
47^░; the depth being i of the pitch, the top being rounded off bj-
radius -Jr and the bottom by a radius J of the pitch.

     The Committee has had an opportunity of examining screw- plates and
numerous packets of the corresponding screws manufactured on this

system.

     The following table gives the pitches and diameters in millimetres
and ' mils ' ' to two significant figures, and the number of threads per inch
of all the screws comprised in the small screw series, which happens to
cover the exact ground to which the attention of the Committee has been
specially directed, namely, diameters below the ^-inch.

     It is to be observed tliat tlie numbers by which the screws are desig-
nated, given in the first column, are not arbitrary. Each pitch of the

series is yrrths of that which succeeds rt in the table.

Thus the several pitches are :

This series may be expressed in the form :

....0-9"; 0-91; 0-92; 0-93;                                                                        0-9░;. . . (1)

whence it is at once evident that the designating number of a screw is the
index of the power to which 0'9 must be raised in order to ascertain its

exact pitch in millimetres.

     The method by which the relation between pitch and diameter is
arrived at will be gathered from the following explanation :

   DLet represent the diameter and P the pitch. Then, generally,

D ^Evidently there can be no constant term, for when                                                         0, P must

also := 0. Moreover, D, practically cannot be a simple multiple of P, for

experience has shown that small screws must have a less number of threads

per diameter than large screws.

Hence the formula will be of the form

                             D = m Pk                                                              .  .  (2)
                                                                                                .

mwhere and h are constants to be determined.

     Since 1'^ is 1 whatever be the value of J:, it follows that the coefficient

m Drepresents the value of when P is 1. The Swiss Committee agreed

that the unit pitch (1 millimetre) should be adopted for the screw having
m =a diameter of 6 millimetres ; in other words they make
                                                                                                         6.

The value of k must be ascertained by trial.

=h l would give a constant ratio, which we know is inadmissible.
=h 2 will be found on trial to give a far too rapid decrease in the

ratio of diameter to pitch.

The several simple fractions between these limiting values were tried

in succession, and the results obtained when using f were found to give

results that best accord with practice and experience.

Substituting the values thus arrived at in (2), the formula becomes

                                D = 6P^ . . . (3)

     The Swiss system is thus very complete, but there are reasons which
prevent this Committee from recommending its adoption in its entirety.

    4. No one has done more to establish gauges of all kinds in England
than Sir Joseph Whitworth. His classical paper on ' An uniform system

of screw threads ' was communicated as far back as 1841 to the Institution

of Civil Engineers. He had made an extensive collection of screw-bolts

from the principal workshops throughout England, and the average thread
was cai'efully measured for different diameters. The ^, -j, 1, and li inches
were selected and taken as the fixed points of a scale by which the inter-
mediate sizes were regulated. The result is an admirable thread for the
large iron bolts and screws used in fitting up steam-engines and other
machinery. The angle made by the sides of this thread is 55░. One-
sixth of the depth of the thread is rounded oS" from the top, and one-
sixth from the bottom. The actual depth is rather more than three-fifths,
and less than two-thirds, of the pitch.
314 EEPOBT-- 1882.

The slow adoption of such an admirable system was perhaps due,

in great measure, to the fact that it was put forward by an individual

Aand not by an Association.  single individual, however exalted his

reputation, cannot secure that immediate and universal attention which

is obtained by such an organisation as the British Association. The

system of units of electrical measurements sanctioned by the Association

obtained instant recognition, and has now, thanks to the Congress of

Electricians held in Paris in October 1881, become universally accepted.

It is hoped that the same result will follow the recommendations of this

Committee.

5. The question of the introduction of the metrical system occupied

the serious consideration of the Committee, but, considei'ing the fact that

it is not generally adopted in engineering or manufacture in England,

and that it is as yet little understood by our workmen, it was thought

better to suggest no change in this direction. The Committee is not

insensible to the simplicity of the metrical s^^stem and to its possible

universality, nor to the fact of its gradual introduction in scientific circles
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

but while the manufacturing interests are still wedded to the British inch

and its multiples and sub-multiples, and while the British legal standard

of length is still the yard, the Committee has felt it impossible to suggest

a change which has little chance of adoption, and which might jeopardise

--the introduction of that with which they are more concerned viz., a

uniform screw-thread.

Hence it was determined that the unit of length taken should be the

' mil,' and that the decimal system should be adopted for expressing

dimensions.

6. The use of a screw is to draw together and to unite certain parts

of apparatus in firm and intimate contact. To attain these ends a screw

must facilitate the application of mechanical power to draw the parts

together, and it must possess strength to hold them so ; it must not in-
terfere with the easy separation of these united parts when necessary

--it must possess durability that is, it must be capable of repeated use

without undue friction and without wear, otherwise it will speedily become

loose and dangerous when frequently removed and restored. There has

to be considered the pitch of the screw, its relation to the diameter of

the bolt on which it is cut, the depth of the cut, and the form of the

thread. The pitch primarily determines the power of the screw, for it

determines, for each diameter, the angle of the inclined plane ; the depth
determines the section of core left to resist shear or rupture ; while the
form of the thread determines the durability and efficiency, and deter-

mines also the surface of thread to bear endway strain.

7. The Committee have devoted very considerable attention to the

pitch, form, and depth of screws, and they have compared together a

large number of different kinds, some of which are in actual use, while

others have only been suggested. They have, moreover, decided on re-

commending the adoption of the Whitworth form of thread, not only

because it is so well known, but because experience has proved it excellent

and unsurpassed when employed for engineers' bolts. The Committee,

howevex-, are not unanimous on all questions involved by this proposal,

and as there are several points that require to be thoroughly sifted and

tested, they ask to be reconstituted and to be allowed a small grant to put

their proposal to the test of practice, and to have a few gauges con-

structed for distribution or examination.
         ON THE BEST MEANS OF ASCERTAINING WIND PRESSURES. 315

Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. James Glaisher, Mr. C.

   W. Merrifield, Sir Frederick Bramvvell, Professor 0. Eeynolds,
   Professor W. Cawthorne Unwin, Mr. Eogers Field, Mr. T. Hawks-

   ley, and Mr. A. T. Atchison {Secretary), appointed to consider
   and report upon the best Tiieans of ascertaining the effective Wind
   Pressitres to ^vhich buildings and structures are exposed.

The total pressure on small plane surfaces due to actual winds in high

and exposed positions has to a great extent been ascertained with suffi-
cient accuracy for engineering purposes, and the relation between the

pressure and the velocity on flat plates is also known with accuracy
enough to make the observations with velocity anemometers available in
estimating the probable maximum pressure in such exposed positions as

are chosen for the placing of anemometers.
     It must be assumed for the present at least, that for engineering

purposes, pressures of 80 lbs. or even 90 lbs. per square foot on small

surfaces have been correctly recorded in extremely exposed positions

such as the Bidston Observatory, while pressures approaching the limit

prescribed by the Board of Trade (56 lbs. per square foot), may possibly

act on engineering structures in exposed positions.

     In applying these data to engineering structures the question arises
whether their form, size, and exposure is so difiFerent from a thin ane-
mometer plate that the effective pressures to which they are subject can-

not be deduced from the latter.

To answer this question inquiries on the following points appear

necessary.

     i. The law of the distribution of the pressure of a fluid impinging on a

surface.

    ii. What is the relation of the direct front pressure and the negative
pressure produced by the foi'mation of a partial vacuum behind the plate

due to the gradual curvature of the fluid stream lines in passing an

obstacle.

    iii. What is the law of variation of pressure with increase of area oБ

surface.

    iv. What is the law of variation of pressure with increase of elevation

above the ground surface.

    V. How far the form of actual engineering structures diminishes the

front or back pressure which would be experienced by a flat plate similarly

placed.

    There seems reason to believe that the maximum direct pressure on a

surface  due  to  fluid impinging  on  it at a velocity v is -Gv--^  when  G  *   the

                                                                              is

weight of a cubic unit of the fluid. From the point where the pressure
is greatest the intensity must diminish towards the. edges, where it may

possibly even become negative (or less than the barometric pressure),
but the law of variation is almost entirely unknown, and requires investi-

gation by direct experiment.

    Further, the total pressure registered by an anemometer plate is made
up of the direct pressure which, from what has been said above, cannot

G--exceed the area multiplied by       and a negative pressure at the back
316 KEPORT-- 1882.

of the plate the whole amount of which is imperfectly known, and about
the distribution of which nothing has yet been ascertained.

     The total observed pressure on a thin plate of small size is somewhere

A-- AGin value between 1'4 A--- and 2 Gr - where is the arear of the plate,

whicli appears to show (1) that on a small plate the variation of pressure
is not very great, and (2) that the negative pressure approaches to at It ast

one-half the front pressure.

     The Committee consider that observations might usefully be made to
throw light upon some of these points, and they suggest that as with the
velocities under consideration, the pressures of air in motion probably

follow approximately the laws of the pressure of water in motion, experi-

ments should first be made in running water.

   A steady flowing river affords a current of fluid moving with fairly

uniform motion at a definite and readily measurable velocity, while the

pressures of a stream of water are much more easily measured than those
of an air current. Hence the determination of the pressures at diSerent

points of the front and back of a plate immersed in a river could be easily
made, and would establish the law of distribution applicable to any fluid,
to wind as well as water.

     Further, the influence of the form of the obstacle on the pressure
produced by the stream could be readily determined, the extent to which
one body would be sheltered by another placed at various distances above
it could be observed, and the total pressures on such structures as a
girder or a pair of girders placed a short distance apart at right angles to
the stream could be measured.

     Respecting the law of the variation of pressure with increase of area,
the older French experiments give conflicting results, the pressure in
some cases being found to increase more rapidly and in others less rapidly
than the area, while White, by a comparison of the observed and calcu-
lated heel of ships under sail, has arrived at the conclusion that the

former is the case. As to experiments on this point we have no recom-
mendation to make, bat we believe that the observations now being
carried on with a pressure plate of 300 square feet in area by Messrs.
Fowler and Baker, at the site of the proposed Forth Bridge, will give
much useful information.

     As to the increase of pressure at diSerent elevations above the surface
of the ground, which is of special importance in the consideration of
engineering structures, we recommend that experiments should be made
by placing anemometers at various heights, supported by a lofty chimney

or other isolated structure.

     It would appear of the highest importance to engineers that some data
should be available to enable them to determine the influence of the
exposure of a structure.

     As in the design of marine works the depth of water and the length
of fetch enable some estimate to be made of the strength of structure

required to withstand the heaviest seas to which they may be exposed, so
a careful comparison of the wind pressures observed during the height of a

gale at various stations where anemometers exist with any standard within
the track of the gale, would enable some estimate of the relative exposure
of similar places to be made.

      Exceptionally high gusts of short duration should be excluded from
 the comparison, as being probably limited in area.

On the Boiling Points and Valour Tension of Mercury, of Sulphury
   and of some Compounds of Carbon, determined by means of the
  Hydrogen Thermo'ineter. By Professor J. M. Crafts.

A HYDROGEN thermometer, in preference to an air thermometer, was

adopted, because the more rapid flow of hydrogen through a capillary

tube permits the use of one of smaller dimensions than when air is taken.

A new form of constant-volume thermometer was used, in which an

electric contact between the mercury in the manometer and a platinum

point causes a current to excite a magnet, and close a cock to arrest

the flow of mercury into the manometer tube at the moment that the

gas attains a fixed volume, determined by the surface of the mercury

touching the platinum point.

The advantages secured by the system are the reduction of the obser-

vations  of the  mercury level  to  one,  instead  of  two                          the possibility of
                                                                                 ;

diminishing the size of thermometer bulb from 200--500 cc. to 1-10 cc. j

and the rapidity of action due to the automatic movement of the

instrument.

The calculation of results has been facilitated by the compilation of

an extended series of tables.

The boiling point of mercury was redetermined with an apparatus-

similar to that used for taking the boiling point of water ; and the chief

causes of error, which Regnault noticed regarding his own experiments,

have been removed. It is proposed to use boiling mercury, like water, to

fix an additional fundamental point in thermometry.

Mercury boils at 357-0 under a bai^ometric pressure of 760 millimetres.

Sulphur boils at about one degree lower than the temperature given

by Regnault, and can be used to fix temperatures near 444░.

    Two other substances were found well adapted to obtain constant

temperatures near 200 and 800 Centigrade, and the means of purifying
them were carefully studied. Naphthaline, when pure enough to melt at

79'6-79-9, does not vary more than 0-1░ from the boiling point 218'06,

bar. 760' mm. Benzophenone prepared by the action of oxychloride of

carbon upon pure benzine in the presence of chloride of aluminium, when,

pure enough to melt at 47░7-48░-0, boils at 306░-l, bar. 760 mm.

The boiling points of these two substances were determined under

pressures varying from 87 to 2,300 mm., giving a series of temperatures

that can be easily established and maintained for any length of time.
The range of temperature is from 140░ to 350░.

It is very probable that benzine may also be easily obtained with a

perfectly fixed boiling point, and it is intended to study the properties of

benzine purified by fractional crystallisations on a large scale. When per-

fectly pure fragments of solidified benzine are allowed to melt with the

precautions usual in a zero-point determination, a delicate thermometer

only sinks from 5-17 to 5░-lG during the fusion. The product studied by

Regnault melted at 4'45, and was impure.

     The boiling points of the following carbon compounds are grouped to-
show that some of these experiments point to the conclusion that succes-

sive, similar, additions to the molecular weight do not cause the boilino-

On the Method of Harmonic Analysis used in deducing the Nu~
   inerical Values of the Tides of long 'period, and on a Mis-print
  in the Tidal Report for 1872. By Q. H. Darwin, M.A., F.R.S.

[A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in cxtenso among

                                                               the Keports.]

I HAVE recently been carrying out a laborious reduction by the method of
Least Squares of the observations of the tides of long period at a number
of stations. The results, which seem to have an important bearing on

the question of the rigidity of the earth's mass, will appear as Д 848 in the

new edition of Thomson and Tait's ' Natural Philosophy,' now in the

press.

      Subsequently to the completion of the calculations Professor J. C.

Adams discovered a misprint in the Tidal Report of 1872, which forms

the basis for the method of harmonic analysis which has been applied to

the tidal observations.

    On inquiring of Mr. Roberts, who has superintended the original
computations, Professor Adams learnt that the erroneous formula has

been used in all the reductions of the long-period tides.

    It now therefore becomes necessary to investigate the amount of
error which may have been incui'red.

     The erroneous formula occurs near the middle of page 371 of the

' Report of the British Association ' for 1872, in the instructions for
clearing the diurnal means from the influence of the shoi't-period tides

in the first of the two formulee for that jjurpose, the factor, sin 12;i/sin \n,

should obviously be replaced by sin 24<}i/sinii.

I shall now therefore go over the process of clearing, shall evaluate

the eSect of non-clearance, and shall indicate what I conceive to be im-

provements in the method of the Tidal Report.

    On any day, the height of water above the datum line is measured at

0^, l"^, 21* . . . . 24'* ; then the mean height of water for that day may

be taken as 174th of the sum of the 25 heights less the mean of the

heights at O^* and 2^^. In the Report the instruction is to take yr^th of

sumthe  of the heights at O*", li╗ . . . . 23^^   At the time that I wrote

this paper I conceived this to be less accurate than the method here

suggested. But after conversation with Sir William Thomson, I per-

ceive that the rule of the Report is just a shade more accurate than that

here suggested. If, however, it were practically more convenient to find

the heights of the tides of short periods at each midnight (see below)

instead of at 11.30, then the rule here given would be practically prefer-

able. As the computations in this paper have been made from the rule

as here suggested, I leave the analysis in the form in which it stood

originally.

   We wish to find how much this diurnal mean is influenced by a short-
H --period tide, for which the expression is cos (nt e).

    Now let t^ be the time at O"* of the day in question, measured from

=the epoch when ^ 0.

should be done for each short-period tide, which experience shows may

exercise a sensible effect on the I'esult. But in the present instance we

have to trace the results of non-clearance.

The next step is to find the mean height of water for the whole year.

There are altogether 365 X 24 -f- 1 heights given, being those at each

--hour from 0^ of day 1 to 24*^ of day 365. The proper mean is ^^ --

of the sum of the 365 x 24 -f- 1 heights less the mean of the heights
at 0^ of day 1 and 24*^ of day 365. From the manner in which the

diurnal means were formed this is clearly -3^ 5 of the sum of the diurnal

means.

    Now when there is no clearance, it was shown above that the diurnal
mean for the (i + l)th day contains the undue term:

     Since 12 n is identical with ^v, sin 12?i divides out with sin |)', and

the result is exactly what we should have found if the mean had been ob-

tained by considering the series of hourly values throughout the year, with

attention to the rule of only taking a half of the first and last terms.

This is obviously correct.

    It will be shown below how much this improper term in the expression
for mean water will affect the result.

    The next step is to find how much the diurnal naeans depart from
mean water ; these differences are then to be the subject of harmonic

analysis for the purpose of extracting the long-period tides.

The ch's have now to be submitted to harmonic analysis for extracting

the long-period tides, but as the values of ch are given discontinuously
for each midnight, the continvious integrals, which arise in such analysis,
are replaced by finite integrals.

Now +if we form 2 ch; cos [X,(r /)], it is obvious that A^ will be

multiplied by a coefficient differing but little from 183, and that the

coefficient of B^, and all the other coefficients of the ^'s and L"s, will be

                                                                                       =' .11-, 1

nearly 183, and all the other coefficients small. Proceeding in the same
way with each long-period tide we shall obtain twice as many equations

as there are long-period tidts, in each of which there is oiie unknown

A Bor with a coefficient nearly equal to 183. These equations may be

solved by successive approximation, and the two components of each tide

evaluated.

   We must now trace the undue term through this process.

universally applicable.

     The manner in which this inconvenient result is brought about is

curious.

     The finite integrals S, which arise in the harmonic analysis, are of
course the representatives of the integrals which arise in the analysis of

     The discrepancy enters in the assumption practically made in the

treatment through diurnal means, that because the long-period tide

varies slowly it is sufficiently accurate to estimate its height only once
in the twenty-four hours.

+The expression il iJi^ cos A(t ?') is of course intended to be, and in

where j is the number of m.s. hours since 0"^ of day 1, and tJi'j is the

departure from mean water at the_y'tli hour, and where we take a half of

the first and last terms. The term due to the tide n in dh'j is of course

+ --J2cos [n(t j) Б]. Then if we effect the summations involved in this

expression, we shall find that one of the two terms vanishes when

+ =|(A >') 360░, just as it does in the continuous integral.

It follows therefore that the method by diumial means leads to a

considerably different result from that by hourly values, or by con-

tinuous integration. This does not constitute a reason for discarding

the method of diurnal means in these special cases, but it is necessary to

pay careful attention to the terms introduced in that process.

We have to consider what values of n added to or subtracted from these

15░ or 30░ per m.s. hour.

The accompauyiDg schedule gives the values of (n) which give these

results.

Amongst the resulting speeds there are only a few Avhich correspond

with actually existing sensible short-period tides. These are marked in

     ' The point of view from which I here regard the problem of clearing the daily
means is, as I learn from Sir William Thomson, somewhat different from that sup-
posed to be adopted in the Tidal Report. It is there supposed that the results of
the previous harmonic analysis for the tides of short period are utilised to subtract

the tide of short period from eveiy hourly value of the height of water, but instead

of making twenty-four subtractions for each day, a twenty-fourth part of the sum of
the quantities to be subtracted is taken from tlie diurnal mean. From this point of
view a result practically identical with that in the te.Kt may be obtained.

to make the result a maximum, the following would have been the erroi's

which becomes %, is equal to 365.

--326 BEroRT 1882.

Tables, we see tliat in the case of the synodic fortnightly the results

of undue influence are very serious, and improper purification of daily

means will have rendered the results utterly worthless. The value of

the monthly elliptic tide may be very perceptibly affected by the M, IS", O

tides, but the values of the fortnightly, semiannual, and annual tides will

not have been very considerably altered. M, N, O are, however, only

three of the tides exercising influence, and it will be shown below that

the monthly elliptic tide may be further affected.

The other tides, whose effects it is well to consider, are those in which

aC'' =b ^) is a multiple of 180", for, as shown above, in these cases the
method of procedure by diurnal means leads to a cumulative influence.

Referring back to Table I. we see that the following are the cases

of this peculiar influence : (1) the semidiurnal X tide on the elliptic
Mmonthly
                                              ;  tide on the synodic fortnightly (already
(2) the semidiurnal
Kconsidered)
                                                               ;  tide on  the semiannual
(3) the semidiurnal                                                                                                                                            ;  (4)  the

K Rdiurnal and P tides, and the semidiurnal and T tides on the annual

tide.

    A rough approximation will suffice in these cases, and this may be

made by only paying attention to that one of the two terms representing

undue influence, in which there occurs the indeterminate expression %.

%It has already been shown that is here equal to 365. Then remember-

ing that the 183 in the denominator of the expression for undue influence

is itself approximate, and may be treated as a half of 365, we see that

the required expression is simply

              R^^ sin 12n cot ^n.

     The numerical values of n, the speed in degrees per m.s. hour, for the

X, K, K, R, T tides will be found in the Report for 1876.
    From these we may compute J^^ sin 12n cot ^i. Then, as a numerical

Bexample we may take tlie corresponding- semi-ranges for the X, K, K, R, T

tides for Liverpool in the years 1857-8 and 1860-70, and assuming that

the phases in those years were such as to make the influence a maxi-
mum, we may compute the maximum influence. The results of these

calculations are embodied in the following Table VI.

                     Table VI.

Influence of
WORKS ON THE GEOLOGY AND PALEONTOLOGY OF OXFORDSHIRE, ETC, 327-

    From these results we see tliat the effect of non-clearance of daily
means may be quite sensible, although not important. The elliptic

monthly tide suffers most, as it did in the results given in Table V., and

it seems to follow, from the nature of the mistake which has been made

in the reductions, that the values of the elliptic monthly tide assigned in

the various reports may be quite sensibly in error.

     It appears from Mr. Roberts' letter in answer to Professor Adams,
that the purification of diurnal means has been correctly carried out as

regards the diurnal tides, but incorrectly as regards the semidiurnal.
In fact, if n be the speed per hour of a semidiurnal tide, sin 12 n/sin ^ n
has the opposite sign from sin 67i/sin ^n (which is the factor which has
actually been used), and therefore the corrections arising from the semi-

diurnal tides have been applied with the wrong signs.

   We may conclude from the preceding discussion that the values

deduced for the fortnightly, semiannual, and annual tides are not

seriously vitiated ; those for the monthly elliptic tide may be sensibly

affected ; and that for the synodic fortnightly is utterly worthless.

     Although I have not seen the actual computations for reducing the

long tides, yet it apjDears certain that the process of clearing the diurnal

means must be very laborious. The preceding analysis shows that it is
perfectly practicable to work with uncleared daily means up to the last
stage, in which the final equations for the yl's and i?'s are formed, and
the proper corrections may be then applied. The numerical coefficients

+ -i_ sin I2n sinl82^()/
A) ^^^ _i_ sin 12?^ sin 1821(r  \
                                   )

+ --"* tan^n sin ^(i' X)
"* tan^n sin-|(╗' X.)

may be computed once for all, for the influence of each short tide on each

long tide.

    + --Then i (- 182) Б is the phase of the short tide at midnight, July

1--2, and if time is measured from noon or 0^'' of January 1, r is -^ and

X X 182^ may be computed once for all for each long tide.
    Thus the greater part of the materials for the corrections may be kept

ready to hand, and the corrections from even four of five tides may be

applied very quickly.

     The practical recommendation for future operations which I have to
make is, that the clearance should not be effected for each day's mean,

but only in the final equations.

List of Woo'ks on the Geology and Palmontology of Oxfordshire,
   of Berkshire, and of BucJcinghamshire. By William Whitaker

    B.A., F.G.S.

   [A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso
                                            among the Reports.]

                         1. PREFATORY NOTE.

     This is a continuation of the County or District Lists, of which a
Catalogue was given at the head of the Welsh List in the Report for
1880 (p. 397). The only additions since made (except the reprints of
.328                                     KEPOKT 1882.

Cambridgeshire and Nottinghamshire therein noticed) being as fol-
lows :

     Cheshire. Reprinted, with additions, in the Geological Survey Memoir
on sheet 80, S.W., pp. 40-52.

     Cumberland. Trans. Cumheiland Assoc, (now printing).

    Norfolk. By W. Whitaker and H. B. Woodward, pp. 171-204 of

' The Geology of the Country around Norwich,' 1882 [wrongly dated

1881]. Geological Survey Memoir.

     In the List now brought forward the same plan has been pursued as

in that for Wales.

     The Oxfordshire List has been taken first of the three counties, as
probably of the most interest (in view of the proposed British Association
Meeting of 1883).' Works already entered under that county are not
again entered under the othei'S, but referred to by their numbers, except
in the case of some Geological Survey maps, of which it is convenient to
note the parts that refer to each county. In like way works entered
under Berks are referred to by number under Bucks.

     Perhaps some of the general works noticed in the London Basin List

{Geological Survey Memoirs, vol. iv.) may refer to these counties, besides
those now included (see Nos. 13, 46, 55, 57, and 193 of that List).

Notes on the oldest Records of the Sea-Route to China from, Western

                  Asia. By Colonel H. Yule, (7.5., R.E,

   [A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extcnso
                                              among the Reports.]

The purpose of this paper is to review, as concisely as may be prac-

ticable, the geography of the most ancient sea-trade -with China, and to
set forth tlie persistence of the maritime tradition of the route to that
country during the first nine or ten centuries of the Christian era. In

the bulk of its detail this papei- has little pretension to originality. I
have mj'self at various times given attention to the subject, and have

elaborated parts of it ; but I shall make use of any books or papers which

appear to me to contribute sound views, as well as of my own. I do not

know of any work that treats the whole subject precisely as I propose

to do.

   --The chief original sources of informa.tion are the following :

     1. The anonymous Periplas of the Erythraean Sea, the date of which
we shall assume, after Dr. Carl MilUer, to be about a.d. 80-90.

     2. Ptolemy's Geographical Tablei5, dating about A.D. 150, and his
extracts from Marinus of Tyre. The latter derived, apparently, a main
part of his information regarding the sea-voyage from a navigator or

trader of the name of Alexander, whose date may be put conjecturally

about A.D. 100.
     3. The ' Topographia Christiana ' of Cosmas, c. a.d. 545.

     4. The Arab Geography of Ibn Khordadbah, in the first half of
the 9th century; the fii'st part of the Arabic Notices of India and China,
last translated by M. Reinaud, dating from A.D. 851 and supplemented

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

to some extent by the work of Mas'iidi (c. 930-940).
     The earliest of these writers, the author of the Periplus, knows

Thin, of which Tliinai was the chief city, lying inland and far towards
the north. The country lay behind Chryse (i.e. Indo-China), and where
the sea comes to an end, i.e. where navigation then terminated. This
country of Thin is difficult of access ; it stretches from this eastern
extremity of the earth far towards the north and west, so as to approach
the Caspian. It sends silk and silk-stuSs to the ports of Western India,
through Bactria, as well as by another route debouching on the Ganges.'
The country thus defined is evidently, as its names would lead us to

expect, China.

     Ptolemy's statements (including those of Marinus) represent the

great nation of the East, occupj'ing the extremity of the known and in-
habited earth, under a double aspect and title, viz., as Serct^, when
reached by the long land-route through Central Asia, and as tSinae, when
reached by the sea-voyages, of whicli we shall speak more particularly.

     In the notices of Cosmas we find the conception of China in a more
distinct and modern shape, and the name now quite indisputable ; but

still there has been no break in the tradition. He has a correct idea of

the position of Tzinista (or GJiiiiistdn), the remotest of all the ladies, and
the country of silk, as lying on the extreme eastern coast of Asia, ' com-
passed by the ocean running round it to the left (i.e. the north), just as
the same ocean compasses Barbaiy (i.e. the Somal Country in Eastern
Africa) round to the right' (or south). Beyond it was neither habita-
tion nor navigation. To reach it the navigator passed the Pepper
Country (i.e. Malabar), Sielediha or Taprobanc (i.e. Ceylon), the coast of
the Conch or 5(tФA;A-shells (Tinnevelly) and Kaber (probably the Cauvery
Delta). Further off was the Clove Country (i.e. the Islands of the Indian
Archipelago), and then Tzinista.

' It would be beside the present purpose to discuss this curious notice of such a

trade route. See the present writer's Introductory Essay to Captain Gill's River of

Golden Sand, and the other testimonies to such a traffic cited there. I will quote these

words :  '          .  The trade that brought these stuffs must have been of that obscure hand-
                 .

to-hand kind, probablj'' through Tibet, analogous in character to the trade which in

prehistoric Europe brought amber, tin, or jade from vast distances.' (juj). cit. p. [32].)
OLDEST RECORDS OF SEA-ROUTE TO CHINA FROM WESTERN ASIA. 349

We next come to the Arab vojagers of the 8th and 9th centuries.

The most material difference between them and the navigators of the

first century is that the latter, though acquainted with the direct monsoon

courses, and sometimes using these for the voyage from the Red Sea and

its vicinity to Guzerat and Malabar, did not apparently yet venture on

the direct voyage across the Bay of Bengal.

But the nature of the trade, and the pick-up cargoes which are

indicated in the Periplus, probably made the coasting voyage more usual

even on this side of Cape Comorin.

     Let us follow the Greek or Persian navigator from the Persian. Gulf,

taking him up where he first comes into Indian waters. He passes the

low flat coast into which Sinthos (the Sind or Indus) discharges by seven

mouths, touching at a port called Barbaricon, represented by the Ltiri

Bandar of later days. He then passes the dangerous shallows of the Gulf

of Irivoih (the Irina or Rinn of Cutch) and Baraliu (or Dvaraka), and

coasting Syrastrij.nc. (Sorath, or Peninsular Guzerat), enters that other

gulf by which he passes the island Baioncs (or Peram, famous in recent

times for its extraordinary mammalian fossils), and so to the mouth of

the Namadus (Narmada or Nerbudda) and its great port of Baryrjaza

(Bhrignkachchha, Bharakachcha, or Baroch). Then coasting LdrikS

(continental Guzerat, the ancient Hindu Lata, and touching, among other

-- --marts, at Siq^para (Supara near Bassein properly Wasai north of

Bombay, and where Mr. J. Campbell has lately been making excavations

with interesting archajological  results)                                             at Kalliena, mentioned  by
                                                                                   ;

Cosmas as well as the Periplus writer (Kalyani, the chief town and port

of Tanna district near Bombay, and the point where the Great Indian

Peninsular Railway bifurcates after crossing the Tanna Strait), at Semylla

or Timiila (Saii)iur or Chaimur of the Arabs, i.e. Chenwul or Chaul,' a

port famous down to the beginning of the seventeenth century, and still
existing,^ too much reduced apparently to have a place in the ' Imperial

Gazetteer,' though it has two or three lines in ' Thornton's'), and so forth

along the coast of Bachanahades (i.e. of Bakshindpatha, the ' southern

region,' the Beccan), and beyond that to Bimyrike. (or the Tamil country)

i.e. Malabar, in which the chief ports were Naura (i.e. Honawar), Niiria

(Mangalore on the Netravati R., the Mangaruth of Cosmas), Tyndis

(Tiuidi near Beypore), Muzlris (Muyiri Kodu or Cranganore) and Nel-

kynda. The absolute identification of the last is not easy, but it was pro-
bably Kalhula, on a river of the same name entering the backwaters, the

only navigable river south of the Berridr at Cranganore. This is pro-

bably the same place as Kanetti, famous in the legendary history of

Malabar ; and it is still a great entrrpol for Travancore pepper, which is

sent hence to the ports on the coast for shipment. That Nelliyuda can-

not have been far from this is clear from the vicinity of the T[vpf>i)r

opi'C or ' Red HiJl ' of the Periplus, which is mentioned in immediate
succession to the mouth of the river of Nelkynda. Thei-e can be no

question that this is the bar of red laterite which a short distance south

of Quilou cuts short the backwater navigation, and is thence called

the Warkalle Barrier. It forms abrupt cliffs on the sea, without beach,

and these cliffs are still known to seamen (as the navigation books show)

Bed.as ' the  Gllfft).'  This is the only thing like a sea-cliff from Oananore

A(or perhaps from Mount d'Ely) to Cape Comorin.             little further is

Komo.rel or Komaria (Cape Comorin), and beyond that Kolchoi and the

pearl-fishery (Jvorlnii or Kolkai, an ancient site near the mouth of the

Tamraparni River). The Periplus writer, as well as Ptolemy, it must be

noted, regard, not Cape Comorin but the next succeeding Cape, called by

Ptolemy Kory (i.e. Koti, the ' bow-tip,' the point of the island Ramesh-

waram) as the southernmost point of India.

Here Taprobanc or Ceylon is apparently left to seaward, and the

navigator passes through Palk's Strait and touching at several ports,

such as Nifjama Metropolis (of Ptolemy) probably Negapatam, Kainara

(Chaheris emporium of Ptolemy, probably Kaveripatan, formerly a port
of importance near the mouth of the Cauvery), Focluke and Sopatma,
which we cannot identify, he reaches Masalia, or Maisolia (Ftol.) the

coast between the Kistna and Godavery, still marked by the' name

Masulipatan, which the striving after meaning has converted and vul-

garised into Macldlpatan, or 'Fish Town.'

    Prom Masalia the navigator of the Periplus 'crosses the Gulf,' i.e.

giving a wide berth to the Godavery sands, and leaving to port the bay

of Coringa, he strikes across the sea, making the land again in Besanme.

or Orissa, perhaps taking for his landmark Mount Mahendra, the highest

(Kmountain on the coast  Lat. 19░4', height 4,923 feet).    From this point

ships bound for the Ganges would renew their coasting; tliose bound for

Chrijse, or Indo-China, took a fresh departure, and struck across the Bay

nearly on a parallel of latitude to Sada in Argijre or A.rakan. Her^e,

--then, is the point which Ptolemy calls, 'Acjitri'ipKiy ruy elc tijv \pva7ii'

il^tirXa'ii'Twi' not, as Lassen makes it, a harbour from which voyages to

Chryso were made, but the point of departure from which vessels buund

thither struck off from the coast of India.

   A little above this point Ptolemy has a town called Paliira, which we

--still find Pahlr in latitude 19░ 27^, some five or six miles above Ganjam.

This place is mentioned both by Barros (1552) and Liuschoten (1597),
and the passages in the Periplus and in Ptolemy to which we have been

referring are aptly illustrated by extracts showing the course of navi-

gation 1,500 to 1,G00 years later.

Thus Linschoten has the following sailing directions (whieh I give

slightly condensed) :

'In the August monsoon, after leaving the Ceylon coast, the navigator

will keep north to the Cape called Fonta de Giiadovariii, [Point Godavery]

in 17░. . . . He will then continue to run along the coast, taking

care not to pass the 19^░ [it should be 19░] without sighting land, for

AHhere there is the mouth of a river called Pnacota. . . .  this coast from

Point Guadovarin is high and mountainous, and easily seen from afar.

From the river of Pnacota to another called Faluor or Falura, a distance

of twelve leagues, you run along the coast with a course from S.W. to E.
Above this last river is a high mountain called Serra de Falura, the highest

mountain on the coast. This river is in 19^░,' &c. The Palura river in
19i░ must be the river of Ganjam (19░ 23'), and the river of Puacota must
be that of Barwa (18░ 54'), which is just thirteen leagues down the coast.
The latter, lying under Mount Mahendra, seems to answer precisely to

Ptolemy's Ajpheterio7i.
OLDEST RECORDS OF SEA-ROUTE TO CHINA FROM WESTERN ASIA. 351

     Turning again to Valentijn's great book on the Dutch East Indies

(1727), under a notice of Bimlipatara, we find the following :--

' In the beginning of February there used to ply, as long as the trade

lasted, for the first despatch to Pegu, a little ship with such goods as were

in demand, and which were taken on board at Masulipatam. . . . From

that place it used to run along the coast up to 18░ N. latitude, and then

crossed seawards ' [in fact it took its aphetcrion, but somewhat further

south than the ancients] ' so as to hit the land on the other side about 16░,

and then, on an oif-shoi-e wind, sailed very easily to the Peguan river of

Syriang ' и [Syriam, below Rangoon].

The Periplus carries us to the mouth of the Ganges, where there was

a mart so-called (Gange), and to the beginning of the Continent of Ghryse,

i.e. Indo- China, but gives no further detail. For this we go to Ptolemy.

He gives us the coast o? Argiiro (' Silvei'-land ') and Ghrijse GhersonnSsus,

with Ghryse GJwra behind it, 'the Golden Penin.sula' and 'the Golden

Region ' In Arr/i'irc we have undoubtedly Arakan, but I have been able

to trace no Indian suggestion of the name, or of the mines which are said

in Ptolemy to have existed in it. The Golden Cliersonnese is specifically

the protuberant Delta of the Irawadi, Pegu, the SuvarnaBhumi or Golden

Land of ancient India, whilst the Golden Region behind is Burma, the

--oldest province of which above Ava is still formally styled in State docu-

ments Sona-parcmfa ' Golden Frontier.' Ptolemy's GhalJcitis also, or

' Copper Region,' approximates carionsly to the Tampa dipa or ' Copper

Island ' of the Burmese State phraseology, a region which embraces Ava

and the ancient capital Pagan.

Proceeding further, the navigator reaches the city of K6U or Kalis,

leaving behind him the islands of Bazalcota, 'Good Fortune' (J Xyndov
fo/yuorof:) and the group of the Barusae. Here at K6U, which [ take

to be a port of the Malay Peninsula, the course of the first-century

Greek and of the ninth-century Arab come together ; and before going

further it is desirable to take up the route of the latter.

The Arabs discriminated a variety of ' seas ' that were passed on the

route to China. Fii-st, of course, the starting-points being Obollah at the

head of the Persian Gulf, or Siraf on its northern shore, is that sea {Bahr

--Furs). Then the Sea of Ldr {Bahr Lurcuci) i.e., of the Greek Larilce

of which we have spoken. This sea washed the shores of Sainiilr, Sahara,

Tilnd, Sinddn, and Kamhdi/a.    The                                                 last  is  well  known                                   of  Saimiir   and
                                                                                                                                         ;

Sahara we have already spoken, as well as of Thdna (or Tanna, as the

Gazetteer spells it)  near  Bombay                                                  it  was   visited  by  Marco                                Polo  in  the

end of the thirteenth century. Sinddn is famous as the port where the

Parsi immigration first landed in India, and has become, by an odd cor-

ruption, in our sea-nomenclature ' St. John's.'

     The Sea of Liir was reckoned to terminate at certain numerous islands
known as the Dihas, of which Sennidib (Ceylon) was the last and greatest

a view of things set forth in that passage of Ammianus which speaks of

the rumours of Julian's accession (a.d. 801) as reaching even to the Divi

and the Serendivi. Here began the ' Sea of Horkand,' a name which we
cannot hesitate to identify with the Jthogandani whom Ptolemy places in

the south of Taprobane, a name which long survived in the form oi Bohana

or Rohuna, occui'ring often in the Mahfivvanso, as a province of which

Mahagamo, the Maagrammon of Ptolemy, was the capital, and which the
early Mahommedans applied in the form al-Ralidn to Adam's Peak.

' Valcntijn, ' Choromaiuli-l,' vol. v. pp. 44, 45.
352 EEPOKT-- 1882.

     The Sea of Horkand extended to al-Mdmni, identified with Sumatra
not only by its position, but by its pi'oducts (snch as Fansiiri camphor,
elephants, brazil-wood, and cannibals), and by its great extent. The

compass of 800 parasangs ascribed to it corresponds roughly with the

estimates of Sumatra which we find in Marco Polo (' 2,000 miles or more '),
and in Barbosa (2,100 miles), and with the truth, which is about 2,300
miles. The navigators, crossing the Sea of Horkand with the western
monsoon, made land at the Islands of Lavja-, Lanlcha, or Lika-Bdlus,
where the naked inhabitants came off in their canoes, bringing ambergris
and coco-nuts for barter ; a description which, with the position, identifies
these islands with the Nicohars, Necuveram of Marco Polo, Ldka-vdram of

Rashid-uddin, and, I can hardly hesitate to say, the Harusae Islands of

Ptolemy.

      Beyond these, and not in the track usually followed, were the two
islands of the Anddmdn Sea, inhabited by dangerous and naked negro
cannibals. Still further out of the way in this dii-ection, and difBcult
of access, was a region of mountains containing mines of silver. The
landmark to reach these was a mountain called al-Khushndmi (' The

auspicious ').

      This 'Land of silver mines,' both position and this description iden-

tify with the Argijrc of Ptolemy. As no silver is known to exist in that
region (Arakan) it seems probable that the Arab indications to that effect
were adopted from the Ptolemaic charts. And this leads me to suggest

also that the Jibal Khush-ndml also was but a translation of the 'AynQov
caiixovor rijoroc, ov Islc of Good Fortune, in those maps, whilst I have

thought also that the name Anddmdn might have been adopted from a
transcript of the same name in Greek as ' 'Ay. ccu/jor. N.'

     At Koli, or Kfdis, I have said the Greek and Arab routes coincide.

For I take this K6U to be the Kalah of the Arabs, which was a month's
sail from Kaulam (Quilon) in Malabar, was a place dependant on the

Maharaja of Zabaj (i.e. Java, or the Great Islands), and near which were
the mountains producing tin. Ko-lo is also mentioned in the Chinese
History of the T'ang dynasty in terms which indicate its jDOsition some-
where in the region of Malacca.^

     Kalah lay on the Sea of Shahthif (which we call the Straits of

Malacca), but was not very far from the entrance of tlie Sea of Kadranj,
a sea which embraced the Gulf of Siam ; therefore I presume that Kalah

was pretty far down the Malay Peninsula. It may, however, have been
Kadah, or Quedda, as we write it. For it was ten days' voyage from

--Kalah to Tiydmah (written also Batnmali, Koi/)hnaJi, &c. a variation

dependent on loose pointing chiefly), a place where they found supplies

of fresh water. And this I take it is Tiymnan (in charts corruptly

Timoan) on the eastern side of the Malay Peninsula. The island ' Thnon '
is a point of note in Linschoten's ' Course from Malacca to Macau in
China ' (1597). ' Thereon,' he says, 'are two places where you find good

fresh water.'

    ' BazaJwttr, and the ' Islc of Good Fortune,' may be taken as the Great and the Little
Andaman respective!}-. The Arab delation mentions, in an unconnected notice, an island
called Malhdn between Serendib and Kalah, i.e. between Cej'lon and the Malay Penin-
sula, ^^ hich was inhabited by black naked cannibals. This may bo another indication
of tlii Andaman group, and the name ma}' have been taken from I'tolemy's Maniolae,
which in his map occupy the position in question.

OLDEST RECORDS OF SEA-ROUTE TO CHINA FROM WESTERN ASIA. 353

    Now the Sea of Kadranj was entered, the Perimulic Gulf of Ptolemy.
Among the coast names of the Greek record we may draw attention to

Samarado, and its coincidence with Samarat, the Buddhisto-classical

name of the place commonly called Ligor (i.e. ' Nagara,' the city) on the

eastern shore of the Malay Peninsula, subject to Siam ; also to the river

Sohanus (Skt. Snvarna, Pali Sohana, 'the Golden'), and to its synonymy

with Sohanap4ri, one of the old cities of Siam in the Menam basin.

The Arabs, as before, instead of coasting, struck across by another

ten days' run to the port of Kadranj. Here was a high mountain to
which slaves used to escape. I should identify Kadranj with the 'Ai^acpa

(^Akadra) of the Greeks, and place it abftnt Chantabon. ' Here,' says

Crawfurd (I quote from 'Hitter,' iv. 1069), ' at a short distance inland

there stands a very high hill, Bombasoi, which affords from its summit an

extensive view over Chantabon and Kamboja.' Between the Sobanus

and Akadra the Greek coasting navigators also mention Tiponohaste,

which would correspond to Bangpasoi of our maps, at the mouth of the

"large navigable river Bangpa-kong.

Ten days further (these tens are doubtless a little arbitrary or gene-

ralised, like the ten days' intervals of Herodotus across the Sahara') the
Arab navigators reach Sa^if or Ghanf, which under the limitations of the

Arabic alphabet represents Champa, or the southern extremity of Cochin

China, which I identify also with the Za/3a or Za/3at of the Greeks.

     It is true that Champa, as known in later days, lay to the east of the

--Mekong Delta, whilst Zabai of the Greeks lay to the west of that and of

the fjieya uKpoT)jpioi the ' Great Cape,' or C. Cambodia of our maps.

rawfurd (' Desc. Diet. Ind. Arch.,' p. 80) seems to say that the Malays

include under the name Champa the whole of what we call Kamboja.
This may possibly be a slip. But it is certain, as we shall see pre-

sently, that the Arab Sanf, which is unquestionably := Champa, also lay

west of the Cape, i.e. within the Gulf of Siam. The fact is that the

Indo-Chinese kingdoms have gone through unceasing and enormous

vicissitudes, and in early days Champa must have been extensive and

powerful, for in the travels of Hwen' T'sang (about a.d. 629) it is called

Ifa/ut-Champa. And my late friend, Lieut. Garnier, who gave great

attention to these questions, has deduced from such data as exist in

Chinese annals and elsewhere, that the ancient kingdom which the

Ghinese describe, under the name of Fii-nan, as extending over the whole

peninsula east of the Gulf of Siam, was a kingdom of the Tsiam or
Champa race.^ The locality of the ancient port of Zabai or Champa is

probably to be sought on the west coast of Kamboja, near the Campot or

the Kang-Kao of our maps. On this coast also was the Komar and

--Kamdrah of Ibn Batuta and other Arab writers : the great source of

aloes-wood the country, then, of the Khmer or Kambojan people.

From Sanf the Arabs sail ten days again to an island (but evidently,

from the plural form of the name, a group of islands) called Sandar-
WeFuldt, where they find fresh Avater.
                                        cannot hesitate to identify this

with Fulo Condor. Marco Polo, in the name which he gives to the group,

* Sondur and Condur,' has furnished a link, if it be needed, to completa

the identification. These may also be the ' Satyrs' Islands ' of Ptolemy,
or they may be his Sindai, for he has a Sinda city on the coast close to this

' Ilerod. iv. 181-183.

position, though his Sindai islands are dropt far away. But it would not
be difficult to show that Ptolemy's islands have been located almost
at random, or as from a pepper-castor.

     "We have said that the Arab Sanf, as well as the Greek Zabai, lay west
of Cape Cambodia. This is proved, by the statement that the Arabs on.
their voyage to China made a ten days' run from Sanf to Pulo Condor.

    Now they enter another sea, which they call the Sea of Sanji. crossing

which they enter the narrow passages and estuaries called the ' Gates of

China.'

     In Ptolemy the distance from Zabai to the Sinae is not determined.
According to Alexander, as quoted by Ptolemy after Marinus, ' the land
beyond the Golden Chersonnese lay facing the south, and sailing by this
for twenty days you reach the city of Zabai, and, still sailing on for some
days southward, but rather to the left, you reach Kattigara ' (the port of
the Sinae). The expression ' southward, but rather to the left,' is easily

accounted for, if we recollect what has just been said of the position of
Zabai on the west coast of Kamboja. Alexander must precisely have run
'south, but rather to the left,' for some days before turning north into the

China Sea.
     But no doubt Ptolemy, from his preconceptions of the general

geography, necessarily misconstrued the further track of Alexander, and

may have failed to quote some further indication. Regarding the Indian

Ocean as a closed basin he is compelled to place the Sinae on the
imaginary eastern shore of that basin. But we know, of course, that the
sea is not a closed basin, and that the Sinae could not have lain south of
Zabai and of the Great Cape, unless we are prepared, with a learned
German, to put them on the west coast of Borneo !

     I should say here that I consider it as unreasonable to explain Sinae

by any name but Chinese, as it would be to explain Indoi by anything

but Hindoos or Indians. Sinae does not require to be demonstrated to

be Chinese ; it is Chinese, just as much as Franrais is French or Espagnols

--Spaniards. But where lay Karrtyopci opfxoc Iiivaif ^Kattigara, the
--port of the Chinese ' is another question.

    When I drew the map of Ancient India, with its elucidations, for Dr..
W. Smith's Classical Atlas, though saying that I saw no means of deter-

mining the position of Kattigara, 1 was still inclined to believe that it was
on the coast of China proper, either of Fokien or of the Tangtse Delta.
But there was always some misgiving that the Ptolemaic statement was
briefer and vaguer than would have been probable had the voyagers
actually reached the swarming hive of the Central Flowery Kingdom.

And to myself the arguments adduced by my friend Bai-on F. von

Richthofen in favour of the location of Kattigara in the Gulf of Tongking
are absolutely convincing. This position seems to satisfy every con-
dition. For

     1. Tongking was for some centuries at that period (b.c. Ill to a.d. 263),.
and at that period only, actually incorporated as part of the Chinese
Empire.

     2. The only port mentioned in the Chinese annals as at that period
open to foreign traffic was Kiau-chi, substantially identical with the
modern capital of Tongking, Kesho or Hanoi. Whilst there are no
notices of foreign arrivals by any other approach, there are repeated notices
of such arrivals by this province, including that famous embassy from
'Antun, King of Ta-t'sin', i.e., M. Aurelius Antoninus, in A.D. 166.
OLDEST EECORDS OF SEA-ROUTE TO CHINA FROM WESTERN ASIA. 355

3. The province in question was then known as Ji-nan (or Zhi-nan,

French /) ; whence possibly the name Sinae, that has travelled so far and

spread over such libraries of literature. The Chinese annalist, who men-
tions the Roman Embassy, adds : ' The people of that kingdom (Ta-t'sin,

or the Roman Empire) come in numbers for ti'ading purposes to Fu-nan,

Ji-nan, and Kiau-chi.' Funan, w^e have seen, was Champa or Zabai. In
Jinan, with its chief port Kiau-chi, we may recognise with assurance

' Kattigara, partus Smarum.' '

     Mr. Bunbury, in his most able and valuable 'History of Ancient

Geography,' whilst admitting the force of my argument as to the identity

of the ancient names /Sinae and Thin with China, observes : ' It does not

appear to me necessary, therefore, to assume that the land so called was
actually a part of the modern China. How easily the name might be

extended to other regions in that part of Asia is sufficiently shown by the
modern appellation of Cochin China, applied to the very country ' in which,

he is inclined to locate the Sinae.

But neither he, nor I in my former consideration of this subject, had

taken account of the facts adduced by Richthofen as to the incorporation

at that time of Tongking with the Chinese Empire, and as to the recogni-

tion at that time of Kiauchi alone (as far as is known) as a gate of access

for Western trade to the Empire. Richthofen's solution has the advantages

of preserving the true meaning of Sinae as ' the Chinese,' and of locating

the Partus Sinarum in what was then politically a part of China, whilst

the remote metropolis Thiyiae remains unequivocally the capital of the

Empire, whether Si-ngan-fu in Shensi, or Loyang in Honan, be meant.

I will only add that though we find Katighara in Edrisi's Geography,

I apprehend this to be a mere adoption from the geography of Ptolemy,

founded on no recent authority. It must have kept its place also on the

later  mediaeval  maps                            for Pigafetta, in that part of the circumnavigation
                                               ;

where the crew of the Victoria began to look out for the Asiatic coast,

Ksays that Magellan ' changed the course . . . until in 13░ of Latitude,

in order to approach the land of Cn^oe Gaticara, which cape (under correc-
tion of those who have made cosmography, for they have never seen it)

is not placed where they think, but is towards the north, in 12░ or there-

abouts.2 It is probable that, as Richthofen points out, Kattigara, or

at any rate, Kiau-chi, was the LuJcin or Al-Wdkin of the early Arab

geographers. But the terminus of the Arab voyagers of the ninth century

--was no longer in Tongking; it was Khdnfu apparently the Kanpu of

           ' The name {Kattigara) seems (in form) Indian, like so many others on the route

        to the Sinae,^e.g., Sobaiia, Pagrasa, Smnarade, R. Sohaims, Tijionobasti, Zaha,
        Tagora, Balonga, Sindc, Aganagara, iirama. It. Ambastus, Itabana, B. Kottiaris,

            ' At first sight the identification of some of these names with names still adhering,
       or traditionally preserved, seems hazardous. But note that most of the names just
       recited are unquestionably Hindu. Hence it is a fact that Hindu names attached to
      places in Indo-China before the time of rtolemy. It is another fact that many Hindu

    --names attach now e.g., Singajmre, Patani, Ligor, Tuthia, Clmmi)a, Suphana,

largest deserts of the world, viz., the Sahara in Africa and the Gobi in

Asia, have been, or are even sometimes now, considered as representa-

tives of recently raised-up sea-basins. But the latest explorations tend

to prove the contrary, at least as far as the Sahara is concerned, and the

little we know of the great Asiatic deserts seems to lead to a similar re-

Mysult.  intention is, therefore, to submit a few considerations on the

geological age of the following three deserts : the Sahara (the Lybian

Desert included), the deserts situated in Turkistan between the Jaxartes

and the Caspian Sea, and the Gobi of Central Asia.

Before speaking of the Sahara, I must observe that this collective

name is applied to an immense region which forms a very broad strip

across the whole of Africa, from the Red Sea to the Atlantic, occupying

an area almost equal to the thii-d of the African continent. This desert,

the largest of the world, is dotted with oases, scattered on the sandy

surface like so many islands amidst the sea, and is known only in the parts

which belong to Algeria, Tunisia, and Tripoli (the last part being called

the Lybian Desert), whereas the western portion of the desert is still a

terra  incognita                                          therefore, I  ask you  to remember that                                                                                                                 by  the           name of

we know of them is most probably applicable to the unknown or little

known tracts, the more so since they are almost exclusively composed of

sand accumulation, the origin and the formation of which we are able to

Since Algeria (which I visited two years ago) has been annexed to

France, our knowledge of this country has made very rapid progress, so

that the ideas which were formerly entertained of the Saharan Desert
have at present undergone an entire change. It has been ascertained
that those sand-deposits, which completely hide the solid framework of
the country, are comparatively local phenomena, and that in the greatest
part of the Sahara-Lybian Desert the subjacent strata are perfectly con-
spicuous, either by cropping out through the superficial deposits, or by
rising as mountains and hills, which almost all belong to the cretaceous
formation, and cover an immense tract of this part of Africa. M. Rolland,

who has particularly studied the cretaceous formation of the Sahara,

speaks ' with astonishment of its extraordinary development, not only in
the French Sahara, where it occupies an area equal to that of all France,

but also in the whole African Desert, touching the Red Sea on the east
and the Atlantic on the west. ' For in all those regions,' says M. Rolland,

' cretaceous strata, containing the same fauna and having the same mine-
ralogical composition, are developed on a line of 60 degrees in length,

with 3 to 6 degrees in width. No later sediments repose on those rocks,

with the exception only of some quaternary deposits, filling up, in the
Lybian Desert, the depressions between the cretaceous mountains.'

     The western extremity of this immense mountain range being situated
in Marocco, cannot have been as well examined as the part crossing the
French Sahara and the Lybian Desert, where the cretaceous formation is no

--less completely developed than in the northern regions of Algeria regions

which may be considered in this respect as truly classic ground ; for the
energetic explorations of M. Ooquand have ascertained there all the known

subdivisions of this formation, characterised by fossils more numerous
and more various than perhaps in any country of a similar extent, the
amount of new ci'etaceous species in northern Algeria being, according to
him, no less than 227.

     The regions of the Sahara not occupied by cretaceous mountains and
hills consist of large surfaces, more or less horizontal, composed either of
loose sands or diluvial (quaternary) deposits. These last seem to have
formed gulfs which, after the emergence of the cretaceous masses, re-
mained covered by the sea, and were filled up in a compai-atively recent

epoch, for they contain shells of mollusks belonging to still living species.

    As for the rocks which underlie the sandy deposits, what we know

of them is due to the numerous wells sunk by the French along the
northern boundaries of the Sahara, particularly in the province of Con-
stantino. The learned engineer, M. Jus, who during twenty years has

directed those admirable works, ranges in the pliocene formation the dif-
ferent rocks (limestone, sandstone, marls, gypsum, &c.), pierced by the
soundings, as well as the impermeable water-bearing clay which forms
the bottom of the wells. This clay presents the most astonishing dis-

crepancies in its level, being sometimes many hundred feet under the

surface of the soil, and sometimes approaching it very closely. So, for in-

stance, in the region of Wadi-Rir, two wells named Ain-Kerma and

Unel-Thiur, are distant one from the other about forty miles, yet the
depth of the first is only 44 feet, and that of the second 321 feet. In

the country of Honda, the well named Nemechdib is 10 feet deep, whereas
the well Barika, almost close to it, is 117 feet. Again, at Batna and at
Biskra, the soundings have been pushed through more than 540 feet,
without reaching any subterranean water, so that the works were aban-

doned, most unfortunately for those two cities, which, are suffering from
the want of good water. The same thing happened at Tahin-Bacu, where

at the depth of 300 feet no water could be reached.

   We must consequently admit that the pliocene impermeable clay, be-

fore having been covered first by different rocks, and finally by sand,
has been exposed to some powerful agents which caused its surface
to undergo the most various changes, so as to produce more or less deep
excavations in some places, and to leave others (often quite near the

first) in the shape of high conical masses, with hollowed basin-like

tops.

     Another curious phenomenon which the sinking of the Algerian wells
has revealed is the discovery of fishes, crabs, and fresh-water moUusks,

at considerable depths. This interesting fact has been ascertained in the
artesian well called Mezer, situated in the desert of Wadi-Rir, quite near
one of the brackish lakes (Ghott or SehJcha of the Arabs), which are so

numerous in the region between Biskra and Tuggurt. When the sound-

ing-line brought those creatures fi-om a depth of about 230 feet, they
were perfectly alive, and M. Jus even boiled a crab, and found it of ex-
cellent taste. The fishes were covered with sand and mud, but the shell
of the crabs was quite bright and glittering, a proof that they inhabited

pure water. M. Jus showed me all these animals, preserved in spirit,

and adorning his rich collections at Batna.

The wells constructed by the French engineers numbered at my last

visit (1879) in the province of Constantine alone (and there are many

elsewhere)  more than 155                                                                    and as the  works  begun  in  1856 have  never

been interrupted, and are rapidly advancing into the interior of the desert,

the time may not be far off when all these regions, now so barren and

dry, will be copiously irrigated, an advantage which they certainly enjoyed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I

a proof that once they were populated and consequently provided with

water. This was most probably got by means of the so-called artesian

wells, which we moderns presume to consider as our own invention,

whereas they were undoubtedly known to the ancients, and were even

constructed in the very Desert of Sahara, as it is ascertained from

Olympiodorus, an historian whose writings have perished, with the

exception of a few fragments quoted by the learned Greek patriarch

Photius, one of which contains the following important passage : ' In the

oasis of Sahara the inhabitants used to scoop out excavations 100 and 250

feet deep, from which jets of pure water rose in high columns.' But it

was not in the Sahai'a alone that the ancients sunk artesian wells, they

multiplied them almost everywhere ; and to those artificial irrigations was
due the once flourishing state of the plain now so arid, which is covered

by the ruins of Balbek (the ancient Heliopolis) and Palmyra. The Eng-

lish travellers, Wood and Darwin, discovered under those heaps of ruins

numerous traces of ancient artesian wells ; and such traces are so frequent

in the Arabian desert crossed by the Hebrews under the leadership of

Moses, that several modern authors, among others M. Joberd, are of

opinion that the miracle attributed to the celebrated Hebrew legislator

of having called forth a jet of water from a rock he struck with his staff,

may be explained by the presence of an artesian well previously known

to him.

ments of ancient civilisation have disappeared, and it is the glorious task
of France to make them revive once more in Algeria. Her exertions

have been crowned with success, and, without mentioning any of the

numerous improvements which this country has received, and which

really have transformed it in a most marvellous vi^ay,' the creation of the

admirable network of artesian wells established on a line of about 500

miles of length, and penetrating every day deeper in the desert, would

be quite sufficient to secure to Prance a prominent place in the history of

civilisation, infinitely superior to that occupied by her most splendid

conquerors.

The annexation of Algeria is one of those events which philo-

sophers and philanthropists must hail with joy ; to them it matters

very little if countries rescued from the iron hands of barbarism and

restored to civilisation may be called Cyprus, Algiers, Tunis, Herat,

Alexandria, <fec., or if the resurrection of such countries is promoted by

a Latin, German, or Slavonian race ; all those petty national distinctions

and susceptibilities vanish before the eternal tribunal of humanity and

Christianity, which bestows the laurels of the conqueror only on the

deliverer and restorer of oppressed nations.

The artesian wells of Algeria suggest still many other scientific con-

siderations, but I will limit myself to a few words upon the probable

origin of the subterranean waters which feed these wells, and of the

enormous sand-accumulations which cover the deserts.

In the Lybian desert, which is only the eastern continuation of the

Sahara, Dr. Zittel is of opinion that between the oasis of Siwah (the seat

of the famous temple of Jupiter Ammon, visited by Alexander the Great)

and the Nile there is a large subterranean depression excavated in the

impermeable clays and marls which compose the underground of the

great part of the desert ; the strata of the northern side of the depression

dip to the south, so as to prevent the water gathered in it from escaping

to the Mediterranean                                                                                                                    those waters,  which  are  furnished  by the  copious
                                                                                                                                     ;

rains falling in the mountainous tracts of Central Africa, penetrate until

they reach the impermeable clays, and in this way are carried to the

above-mentioned natural reservoir. The supposed stratigraphical condi-

tions of this depression have been suggested to the German geologist by

the sections which he observed in the oasis Beharrich, situated near the
Siwah oasis, where the strata of clay and marl are perceived to dip to
the south.

     Some such natural reservoir may exist equally in the Sahara, but as
far as I am aware nothing of that kind has been yet ascertained there, so

that in the present state of our knowledge we are reduced to the suppo-

sition that its subterranean waters are chiefly produced by the rains in

the mountainous country forming its northern boundary, among which

the Aures range plays an important part. Most probably the water

furnished by those mountains (for in the Sahara itself rain is very rare)

oozes through the different open crevices, joints, vaults, etc., and

penetrates into the impermeable argillaceous strata. At any rate, the

above-mentioned presence of fishes and crabs in the well of Mezer, prove

that a communication between the atmosphere and the subterranean
waters must exist, otherwise no animal (at least of the higher classes)

could live there.

   ' This I have endeavoured to prove in my work Espame, Alqerie et Tunine,

The last but not the least important geological element of the Sahara-

Lybian desert, is the sand, which contains no organic remains, except at

places where it is intermingled with underlying older diluvial deposits.

Those enormous sandy accumulations doubtless are not of marine but of

Bubaerial origin. Still their vast proportions render it difficult to decide

the question whence they came and how they have been formed. Dr.

Zittel, to whom we owe valuable observations on the Lybian desert,

thinks that these accumulations of sand are on too large a scale to be

explained by Baron Richthofen's theory of the formation of the Loss in

China, though he concedes to the action of winds an important part in

the Afi'ican deserts also. In consequence Dr. Zittel admits that those

sands have been transported not only by atmospheric movements but also

by water-floods. And as the desert sands consist of quartz which could

not have been furnished by the limestone and marly rocks prevailing in

the desert, he supposes that it may have been derived from the so-called

Nubian sandstone which composes the mountainous range situated in the

southern part of the Lybian desert, and which, after long discussions

among geologists, has definitely been placed in the cretaceous forma-

tion. Dr. Zittel thinks that the disintegration of this sandstone has been

produced by water, the erosive power of which has left in the desert sa

many conspicuous traces, as, for instance, the high and steep sides of the

oasis, the deep depressions, and particularly the isolated rocks he calls

' insular mountains,' considering them as the scattered remnants of once

connected masses, so that, according to him, such gigantic denudations

and erosions can only be the work of violent fresh-water floods coming-

from the south and carrying the large quantity of petrified tree-trunks

so frequent in the Lybian desert. Several objections arise against this

theory, at least as far as the Sahara is concerned, the southern boundaries

of which are not composed, as in the Lybian desert, of sandstone, but

chiefly of limestone, marls, and clay, and consequently could not furnish

the quartz grains yielded by the Nubian sandstone. Moreover, the

violent fresh-water floods proceeding from the south, which, according-

to Dr. Zittel, caused in the Lybian desert the above-mentioned enormous

denudations and erosions, suppose an extraordinary change in the climate

of that  country                                      for,  though  Dr.  Zittel  admits that  in Egypt, and con-
                                                   ;

sequently in the neighbouring countries, the atmospheric humidity was,

at a comparatively i-ecent epoch, ranch greater than now, such power-

ful floods could only be pi'oduced by rains unknown in the most rainy

regions of our globe. At all events M. Rollaud thinks that as far as the

Sahara is concerned, the quaternary and alluvial sandstones which the

desert contains are sufficient for the production of sand-accumulations,

which, according to him, are derived from actual atmospheric agencies,

namely, first, by disintegration, and then by the winds scattering the

grains over the surface of the desert.

The hypothesis of the subaerial origin of those sands receives a strong

support, as well from the facts ascertained in reference to the large

distances to which such sands may be carried as from the comparative

study of atmospheric sands fallen in different countries. Now, even in

the twelfth century the celebrated Ai-ab geographer Edrisi spoke with

astonishment of the clouds of red dust and dry fog which frequently

obscured the sky of the Atlantic between the Green Cape and South

America, a tract which Edrisi qualified for that reason as the Dark Sea

(Bar-el-Mecdolin), and after him the authors of the middle age as Mare

 tenehrosum. This phenomenon, -wliicli Las occapied for a long time the
attention of physicists and naturalists, whose opinions are as con-

tradictory as unsatisfactory, has been recently studied by Dr. Gustav
Helleman, who, in an elaborate work, gives not only a chronological

enumeration of all the observations published on that subject from 1854
to 1874, but represents them graphically on a most instructive map. The
critical analysis of these numerous materials has suggested to the

 Prussian philosopher, conclusions on the origin of this curious pheno-
menon, thoroughly opposite to those hitherto deduced by all his pre-

decessors, including the leai'ned Ehrenberg. These conclusions are : that

the above-mentioned clouds of dust proceed from the "Western Sahara, and
even partly from the French Sahara, for Dr. Helleman informs us that,
having consulted the meteorological registers kept in the French stations

of Laguat, Tnggnrt, Wargla, etc., he ascertained numerous days marked

in those registers as particularly characterised by Sirocco winds, accom-
panied by an atmosphere rendered dusty by sand.

      Another observation in reference to the composition of sands trans-
ported by winds from various countries yielded equally remarkable
results to Gustav Tissandier. Examining microscopically the dust
which fell the 9th of October, 1879, at Boulogne- sur-Mer, and comparing
it with the sand of the Sahara, he found that both were exactly of the
same composition, only the last was of a coarser grain, and that the frag-
ments of cryptogamic plants were in both identical. Moreover, the

French physicist ascertained that when sand from tlie deserts of Sahara
and Gobi was thrown into water, only the coarser particles fell to the
bottom, and the water remained turbid in consequence of a certain

quantity of thin mud swimming in it ; this last, having been micro-

scopically examined, turned out to be very like certain earthy particles
contained in rain-water, which sometimes is so rich in organic substances

that such rains have been qualified as manure rains. The result
which Tissandier deduces from repeated experiences is, that ' the winds
bring about a real selection of the smallest and lightest bodies of the
desert, upraising in the air only the minutest particles, among which are

the vegetable remnants, so that the atmospheric movements may convey
a dust very rich in organic substances, even when they have been bor-

rowed from a sand containing little of them, and that only because the
selection has been applied to large masses.' This curious observation

may suggest the inference that, at least in certain places, the sand of

deserts is not so barren and hostile to vegetation as it at first appears.
At all events, the absence of any animal traces in the Sahara and Gobi
sands examined by M. Tissandier, proves most evidently their subaerial
origin, for had they been deposited in sea-water they would include
numerous microscopic shells of Rhizopoda, which are so abundant in sea
sand, that Alcide d'Orbigny counted in one ounce of sand gathered in the

Antilles Islands, more than three millions of them ; and similar facts may
be ascertained in Europe, where, among other littoral regions, the sand of

the Adriatic shores contains numberless quantities of Rhizopodous shells.
     Again, M. Tacchini attributes an African origin to the highly ferrugi-

nous dust which not long ago fell in many places in Italy. What seems

to indicate such an origin is the fact that numerous globules of magnetic
iron have been found along the shores of Algeria and Tunis. The Italian
astronomer observes, that this fact has a certain importance, for it would

prove that in some cases a terrestrial but not a cosmical origin may be
 362 HEPORT-- 1882.

 ascribed to the meteoric iron globules whicli occur in the sand of remote
 localities, and under the most different conditions, as, for instance, in snow.

      These sandy superficial deposits form the last chapter of the geological
 history of the Sahara, for, so far as I know, no well-ascertained traces
 of the glacial period have been discovered either in Algeria or in the
 Sahara-Lybian desert, so that the absence of the glacial period in those
 parts of Africa furnishes an additional proof of the local and comparatively
 limited character of this important phenomenon, a fact on which I have
 repeatedly insisted in numerous publications.'

      But if after the formation of the superficial sandy masses the Sahara
 had acquired the most prominent features of her present physiognomy,
 still, since that time, not only the hydrographic and climatic, but also
 some topographic conditions of that country have undergone very im-

 portant modifications, as may be deduced from many facts, among which

 I will mention only those pointed out by Rollaud and Clave. The first
 calls our attention to the numerous incrustations of travertine, evidently
 produced from sources which have disappeared, and to the immense
quantity of siliceous fragments worked and shaped by human hands, and
 scattered about large tracts of the desert, where it is not likely that they
could have been distributed, if the now uninhabitable country were not
once inhabited. M. RoUand sums up the conclusions derived from a great
number of similar facts in the following words : ' The climate of Algeria
must have suffered a considerable deterioration since the times of the

Romans.' M. Clave is of the same opinion. He mentions with astonish,

ment the quantity of fragments of arrows made of polished flint, scattered
over the whole space between Biskra and Wargla ; and what is still more

significant, he has observed in the neighbourhood of Oglu-el-Kassi,
those fragments covered by a coating 16 inches thick of gypsum,
evidently deposited by sources of which all traces have vanished. ' Those

flint-fragments invested by gypsous incrustations,' says M. Clave, ' are
most probably the oldest known witnesses of human industry.' Now, the
Lybian desert j-ields to Dr. Zittel exactly similar conclusions. The
learned German geologist observes that between the oasis Chargeh and
the valley of the Nile, the basaltic tufa include leaves of plants, among

others, of the evergreen oak (Querctcs ilex), which no longer exist either
on the oasis or in Upper Egypt. ' Caves bristling with stalactites in
a country perfectly devoid of water,' says Dr. Zittel, 'but particularly
the polished and well-worked flints accumulated on different points of the

now thoroughly dry and empty desert, speak distinctly of a much more

favourable climate than the present one.'

     No doubt such climatic changes ascertained in the Sahara-Lybian

desert must suppose similar changes in the countries surrounding the
Mediterranean basin, as among others : Egypt, Syria, Asia Minor, &c.

And that is really the fact ; the arguments supporting it being as

numerous as convincing. It would not be consistent with the limits im-
posed on this paper to mention even a small number of them, so that I
must content myself with the following observations.

     In his remarkable work on the climate of the Mediterranean coun-
tries,^ Theobald Eischer, after having studied the changes which they

have undergone on that account during historic times, comes to the
conclusion that such changes have not been very conspicuous in the

regions of the northern shores of the basin, where the climatic modifi-
cations, which 1 had pointed out in Asia Minor, are considered by him as

only local and exceptional phenomena, but that it is quite different iti the
regions situated on the southern shores of the Mediterranean, to the

south of the 34th parallel, where rains, even in their normal state, are so
inconsiderable, that the smallest reduction of their amount is sufficient

to alter the climate. Among the countries liable to such reductions,

Fischer quotes Syria and Palestine, countries full of traces of ancient
rivers and artificial irrigation, indicating a region once thickly popu-

lated, but which now is transformed into a dry desert, not only by

the fault of men, but also in consequence of a complete change in the
atmospheric conditions. Fischer also points out the numerous deeply

excavated Wadi in the whole of Africa, which doubtless represent
so many beds of ancient rivers, in a time when rains were much more
frequent than now. This important fact had been (many years before
the publication of Fischer's work) elucidated and discussed, in a masterly

way, by Livingstone.'
     According to Fischer, the increase of the atmospheric dryness in

North Africa is equally proved by the disappearance of the large

mammals and the late introduction of the camel in those regions. This
animal, now quite indispensable for all travelling purposes, seems to have
been unknown in Africa almost until the Christian era, for no figure of
it has hitherto been discovered on the monuments of Egypt and Meroe,

and Polybius, speaking of the Carthaginian cavalry, mentions elephants

but never camels. I had previously the opportunity of pointing out this

interesting fact in Asia Minor,'^ quoting numerous classic authorities,

and among others Herodotus and Xenophon, who both attribute the

victory of Cyrus, in the battle of Sardes, over the Lydian king, to the

presence in the Persian army of camels, the sight of which struck the
Lydian cavalry with terror and made them fly. Even in the sixth cen-

tury of our era, the historian Procopius mentions a similar impression

produced on the Roman cavalry by the sight of the camels employed in

the Arabian army ; but what is still more remarkable is, that as late as in

the twelfth century, Glycas reporting in his ' Annals ' the battle of Sardes,
together with the statements of Herodotus and Xenophon, in refer-
ence to the impression produced by the Persian camels, does not add to
this quotation any remark upon the difference between the habits of the
camels of the ancient and those of his time, which seems to prove that he
did not find anything extraordinary in such statements, and that con-
sequently even in the twelfth century, the camel had not acquired in the

East the perfect indifference it now shows for horses, which I have often ex-
perienced, keeping camels and horses tied up together without causing

either the least annoyance.

     Theobald Fischer quotes the authority of Herodotus and Pliny, and

also many ancient monuments adorned with animal figures, in order to

prove that in historical times North Africa was inhabited by the elephant

and rhinoceros, and,  what  is  still  more  significant,  by  crocodiles                                               for

are consequently compelled to admit an alteration in the climatic con-

ditions of the country, namely, an increase of atmospheric dryness,

which may account for the late introduction of the camel in North Africa

and Asia Minor, as well as for the disappearance of the elephant. In

support of this opinion, Theobald Fischer reminds us, that both in
Asia and Africa the elephant excludes the camel, and vice versa, so that
in the upper part of the valley of the Nile, where the elephant prospers,
the camel thrives with difficulty.

     Dr. Oscar Fraas, the learned German geologist, also quotes ' the
absence on the Egyptian monuments of any figure of the camel, and

that not only in the famous ruined city Sakkarah, the walls of which                                   ,

are covered with pictorial representations of different animals, but also in                         I
Thebes, founded 3,000 years after Sakkarah. This fact proves that at that                            I
time the desert did not exist, the presence of which is moreover excluded                            1
by the numerous splendid monuments, which certainly their constructors
would not have built in the midst of inhospitable solitudes, any more than

the Emperor Hadrian would have erected near Rome the famous Villa

Hadriana amidst marshes, had they existed then as now. Oscar Fraas is

of opinion that in Egypt the climatic conditions were quite different from
the present, even in the time of the Greeks, when Alexandria was the

brilliant focus of science and art, radiating her light on the whole world

then known. He believes that the extraordinary intellectual activity

which animated this city, supposes another climate, with a moister air.

' On the present soil of the Nile land,' says Oscar Fraas, ' no philosophical
system can be born, and no human power could erect universities capable

of coping with those of Europe.'

     The conclusions suggested by Egypt are applicable in a still higher

degree to the neighbouring peninsula of Sinai. When we consider that

in this perfectly arid, waterless peninsula, the people of Israel, counting

60,000 fighting men, remained, after the exodus from Egypt, several

years, it becomes quite impossible not to admit that in those times
Sinai was a fertile Alpine region, provided with rich pasture-grounds and
irrigated by copious sources : in no respect could such a country have
the slightest resemblance to the barren desert it is now.

     The few instances I have reported are sufficient to prove that the

climate of the Sahara-Lybian desert, as well as that of the countries
surrounding the Mediterranean, have really undergone important altera-

tions, even during historical times. Now there are proofs that similar

changes in the level of the ground and in the vegetation of these
regions have taken place at a comparatively recent epoch. Theobald

Fischer, whom I have already had occasion to quote, has devoted to the

study of the topographical modifications of the Mediterranean countries
the same talent and erudition with which he has treated the question of the

successive climatic changes which have occurred there. In his paper, pub-
lished by the Geographical Society of Berlin,^ he elucidates this subject in

a masterly way, and the map annexed to his paper represents graphically

THE DESEETS OF AFRICA AND ASIA.  365

the numerous alternate immersions and emersions positively ascertained
in the littoral regions of almost all the countries surrounding the Mediter-

ranean. On the African shores this phenomenon is particularly striking,
as much by its intensity as by the variety of its manifestations, the

movement of the rising and the sinking of the soil occurring alternately
on the same littoral line, in localities not far distant the one from the
others. Gerhard Rohlfs, the well-known African explorer, has ascertained
the sinking of the whole shore of Tripoli to the Gulf of Great Syrtis,
and, according to him, this sinking is so conspicuous that he was

perfectly able to appreciate it during his repeated visits to the country.

He quotes very remarkable instances of this phenomenon and says : ' I

do not think that anywhere on our globe such a rapid sinking of the soil

has ever been observed.'

     Now, a quite opposite movement of the soil occurs in the neighbouring
Tunisian shores. Here M. Barth has discovered near the modern town
of Gabes ruins of a much older one, which he identifies with the ancient

city Tascape, a city situated, according to the Greek and Roman writers,

on the sea-shore, which is no more the case with the modern Gabes.
Sir Granville Temple has observed traces of an ancient gulf penetrating
from Gabes in the interior of the continent, and connected with the lake
or Chott el Fedjedj (the ancient Tritonis lacus), a connection which has
been interrupted by the rising of the tract, which, under the shape of
an isthmus, now separates the Gulf of Gabes from the lake. Nearer
Tunis we find the bay of Porto Farina, which, two centuries ago, was
considered as an excellent port, 30 to 50 feet deep, so that in the year
1655 Admiral Blake could very comfortably anchor there, with his naval

force, composed of nine men of war. At present, the Porto Farina has
hardly a depth of 2 feet, and the time is not far oS" when the whole bay

will be joined to the continent. Again, the celebrated city of Utica,

which, under the Carthaginians, possessed a splendid port, is now converted
into a large sandy plain, and the ruins of the once littoral city are more

than twelve miles distant from the sea. There are few places in the
world which oflTer a more melancholy contrast between the present and
the past than this sandy, perfectly shadeless plain, which I crossed under
the scorching African June sun, without meeting a single living creature,
and which recalled similar impressions in the classic regions of Asia

Minor, where not only man, but also Nature, has for so many centuries
practised the work of destruction. But if Nature destroys she equally

creates, and in a topographical sense Asia Minor offers, on that account,
the most striking examples. During the ten years I devoted to the

--exploration of that magnificent country, I was able the ancient geo-
--graphers and historians in my hand to ascertain the modifications which

the surface of this country has undergone, only since the Christian era.
Those modifications are so considerable, that taking into account the
increase of solid land, produced only by the formation of large river
deltas, and the filling up of seas and gulfs, it can be said, without
exaggeration, that the surface of Asia Minor has conquered, during this

comparatively short time, the amount of a little province, a kind of
conquest which is still rapidly continuing, so that one day may be realised

the prophecy of Strabo, who, eighteen centuries ago, declared that the

time shall come when the shores of Cilicia may reach the island of Cyprus,

an event likely to give great trouble to diplomatists, if Buch functionaries

are then still existing.
366 REPORT-- 1882.

To those remarks on the different physical changes nnderpfone by the

Sahara-Lybian desert and the Mediterranean regions during the latest

geological periods, and even historical times, I may add a few worda

about some botanical modifications, which probably took place after the

formation of the Mediterranean Sea, considered by several naturalists as

comparatively recent. The fact is, that the two shores of this Sea

present a great difference in the amount and the distribution of certain

vegetable families, a difference which climatic conditions are not sufficient

to explain. Among those vegetable families I will quote only the

CupuUfercB and the ConifercB. In the first, the genus Quermis, or oak, is

particularly conspicuous on that account. In geological aspect the oak

may be considered as of recent origin, for among the thirty-four species

admitted by Count Saporta, all, with the exception of one only (^Quercus

primordialis), appear, for the first time, as late as in the more recent

tertiary formations (miocene and pliocene). Now, Algeria has hardly

nine species of oak,  but Spain,  sixteen species ; France,                                                     twelve                                                       Greece,
                                                                                                                                                           ;

probably more than fifteen; whereas Asia Minor, where the genus

seems to have acquired its maximum of development, has fifty-two

species, of which twenty-six are peculiar to the Anatolian peninsula.'

As for the family of Coniferce, the cedar presents a striking example

of localisation, for, on the whole Mediterranean coast-line, there are only

four points where this beautiful tree grows truly wild, viz., the Lebanon

(Syria), Algeria,  Cilicia  (southern Asia                    Minor), and Cyprus                                                                                             the exist-,
                                                                                                                                                                          ;

ence of the cedar in that last island having been recently ascertained by

Sir Samuel Baker. The Lebanon had been considered as the cradle of

the cedar, before North Africa was known to contain large forests of a

variety of that species (Cedrus Lihani, var. atlantica), but the Austrian

botanist Kotschy and I were so fortunate as to discover in Cilicia a

new locality for this fine tree, much more important than any known

previously, as I believe to have proved,^ when comparing the Algerian

cedar forests with the Anatolian, so that if these last had been known

when the botanist Loudon established the new species of cedar, he would

have called it Cedrus Gilicice instead of Cedrus lAhani.

The two instances of curious localisation, which I have just alluded

to, are sufficient to prove that such phenomena took place after the for-

mation  of the Mediterranean  Sea                     for had the  cedar                                        been  spread                                                 out  on
                                                   ;

the continent which once united Europe to Africa, this tree must have

remained, after the separation of the two continents, on many points of

the northern shores of the Mediterranean, as, for instance, on the moun-

tains of Greece, on the Apennines, the Pyrenees, &c., where the con-

ditions of climate and soil are as favourable to the cedar as they are

in North  Africa,  Asia  Minor, or                    on the  Lebanon                                           whereas, if                                                  we admit
                                                                                                             ;

that the cedar appeared on its present stations after the formation of the

Mediterranean, the impediments opposed by the sea to the diffusion of

the tree on both sides of the Mediterranean account sufficiently for its

localisation.

   A similar reasoning may be applied to the absence of monkeys on

the northern shores of the Mediterranean, and their abundance on the
southern. It is known that the only point in Europe inhabited by wild
monkeys is the rock of Gibraltar ; still they are there by no means in-

digenous, but most probably have been imported by the Arabs during

      tlaeir long domination of Spain, so that had this interesting colony not
      been artificially maintained, there would be now-a-days not a single

     monkey on this rock ; the fact is, that in 1856 they had almost entirely
     disappeared, when Sir William Codrington caused a new importation to
     be made from northern Africa. Just as the cedar, the monkeys of
     Gibraltar (the Macacus inuus of Algeria) would be found now as
     indigenous inhabitants on many shores of Greece, Italy, Spain, &c.,

    had they existed before the separation of Europe from Africa. An

     additional proof of the recent immigration of the monkey in Africa is-,

      that the quaternary fauna of the caves of Gibraltar, so carefully studied
      by English geologists (Busk, Smith, Leith Adams, &c.), has not yielded
      any remains of quadrumana ; and A. R. Wallace admits' that, evea

     at the Miocene epoch, monkeys as well as the large mammals now

      characteristic of Africa (lion, elephant, hycena, rhinoceros, hippopotamus,

      &c.) were spread over Central Europe, but still did not inhabit Africa,
      into which they migrated at a comparatively recent time.

         I will here conclude my very rapid physical sketch of the Sahara-

     Lybian desert by a summary of the most prominent features of the
     geological history of that country ; but before doing it, I wish to say a

      few words about the important scheme of the creation of an inland sea in
     the Sahara, which has been proposed to the French Government by

     Commander Roudaire. As I have fully discussed the question in my last

     work upon Algeria,^ I will content myself only with the following

      remarks.

           The project of this distinguished engineer consists of introducing the
      water of the Gulf of Gabes into the interior of Tunisia and Algeria, by
      cutting through the isthmus which separates the gulf from the large

      lake El-Fedjedj (Tritonis lacus of the ancients), situated under the

      sea-level, as are a whole series of lakes (Chotts) extending in a direct lin&
      from east to west, from the El-Fedjedj far into the interior of Algeria.

     Now, Commander Roudaire thinks that the consequence of cutting the-
      Isthmus of Gabes, the breadth of which is about 18 miles, would be to

      spread the sea-water over a space of about 380 miles (320 kilometres)
      of length from east to west, and about 70 to 80 miles (50 to 60 kilo-
      metres) of breadth. The chief result of such a work would be, according

     to Commander Roudaire, a great improvement in the climate of this-
      part of Sahara, because this large water-surface would give rise to an
      enormous evaporation, which, transported by the south, south-east, or
      south-west winds, into the northern regions of Algeria and Tunisia, must-
      needs become condensed in passing over the Aures Mountains, and be-
     dissolved in copious rains. Moreover, Commander Roudaire declares that
      the creation of this large gulf or inland sea would be nothing else than

I the re-establishment of what has previously existed ; for, supported by

      the authority of Ptolemy and other ancient geographers, he believes thai
      formerly the Isthmus of Gabes did not separate the sea from the lake of
      Tritonis (El-Fedjedj), and that, consequently, the sea penetrated very far

       into the interior of the Sahara.

           At all events, the chief point on which the success of the whole enter-
      prise depends is the question, whether the prevailing winds in this part of

the  Sabara  are  really from  the  south                                      for      if  not, the winds,  instead  of
                                                                   ;

-- --carrying the aqueous vapours to the north, would drive them in the

opposite direction to the Sahara without submitting them to the

condensation produced by the Aures Mountains, so that the creation

of the large mass of vapours would be of no benefit at all to the

country. Unfortunately this most impoi'tant meteorological question is

still very far  from being  decided                                            indeed,  many scientific men in France
                                                                            ;

admit that at Biskra and Tuggurt the north-west, north-east, and north

winds are prevalent.

     As for the statement that the Gulf of Gabes communicated formerly

with the Tritonis lacus (El-Fedjedj) and penetrated deeply into the interior

of the Sahara, this statement of Commander Roudaire, which has been

strongly attacked both in France and Germany, is, as I think to have

proved,' perfectly founded and abundantly supported not only by historical

but also by geological facts.

     Let us now resume, in a few words, the most prominent features of

the geological history of the Sahara- Lybian desert.

     1. The records of this history are very old, for the southern region of

the present Sahara was represented during the Devonian period by a

certain number of isolated masses of limestone, gneiss, and mica-schist,

the limestone containing Devonian fossils. Those masses preserved

their insular position through all the succeeding ages, and never sank

again tinder the sea.

     2. It was during the cretaceous epoch that a large portion of the

present Sahara was upheaved in the shape of variously ramified masses,

so that the sea of the following geological periods could penetrate into

their interior, forming numerous gulfs and bays.
    3. The Sahara was represented down to the quaternary epoch chiefly

by those cretaceous masses which since their upheaval have never been
covered by the sea. During the quaternary period, among the gulfs

which washed the shores of the cretaceous land, the largest occupied the

present country of Igharghar ; the northern extremity of that gulf reached
the place of Biskra, and the southern the cretaceous plateaux of Tademayt

and Tinghert ; the town Wargla occupying almost the central part of the

gulf. As the last was entirely secluded from any communication with

the sea from the north, the littoral part of Algeria having been upraised
long before, and consisting then, as now, of more or less high mountains,

this large quaternary gulf could not find any other way into the interior

of the Saharan cretaceous continent than through the present Gulf of
Gabes ; and the narrow strip of diluvial deposits which, surrounded by
cretaceous rocks, extends from Gabes to the salt lake of Bl-Fedjedj

(Tritonis lacus) proves that here was really the entrance of the quaternary

gulf. This geological fact is important with reference to the question,

so long discussed, of the ancient communication between the lake and

the sea ; it confirms the hypothesis of Commander Roudaire, and I am

not aware that this argument, which I consider as the strongest of
all, has ever been urged in his favour. The upheaval of the quaternary

large gulf (and of many other smaller ones) was the last marine phase

which the Sahara underwent.
     4. Once entirely raised up in all its parts, the Sahara had still to

undergo a subaerial operation which consisted of the formation and

accumulation of sands. It closes the fourth and last stage of its long

geological history, without speaking of the different climatic and topo-

graphical modifications of quite recent times. This history, as it has been

shown, proves that there can be no longer question of a recent rising

of the whole Sahara from the bottom of the sea. It is true the Lybian

desert is probably somewhat younger than its Saharan sister, for tertiary

uncovered deposits (eocene and miocene) have there a larger development

than  the  cretaceous  strata                             but, even  admitting  that  the  Lybian desert
                                                       ;

has been upraised after the Miocene period, it cannot be called recent.

If I have perhaps devoted to the Sahara-Lybian desert more time

'than I ought to have done, it is because, among the chief deserts of

Africa and Asia, this is by far the best known, so that I have only a few
words to say about the Turkestan deserts and the Gobi.

The two largest deserts of Turkestan are situated between the Syr

Daria (Jaxartes) and the Caspian Sea--roughly speaking, between the 45th
and 48th degrees of northern latitude, and consequently under the parallel

-- --of North Italy and Switzerland. The one the more eastern named
Kizyl-Kum (signifying in Turkish 'red sand '), is included between the

Syr Dana and the Amu Daria (Oxus) ; it is limited on the north-west by
the Aral Sea, and extends in the southern direction to Bokhara, having
from north to south a length of about 400 miles, and from east to wesl;
about 300. The other desert, almost of the same development, is situated

between the Amu Daria and the Caspian Sea, and extends from the
country of Khiva to near that of Merv ; the Turcomans generally call it
Kai-a-Kum (black sand).

m I have not visited either of these deserts during my long ramblings

    the East, and I am not aware of anything known as for as their
Ageological constitution is concerned.
                                                                     short notice, however, published
about them in the valuable geographical contributions of Petermann.^

<33ntains a few facts which may throw some little light on that subject.
The sands which cover certain parts of the Jesert are reported as including

shells of mollusks still living in the Aral Set, but where sands are wanting,

clay slates (Thonschiefer) form perfectly umovered surfaces. Very good
water is found everywhere under the sand it a depth of less than a foot,
but it IS reached only at 2 to 4 fathoms in tb clay slates, and is briny and

bitter; this difference seems to prove that the sands contain much less
salt than the clay slate, probably because the salt spread about among the

light quartz particles is more easily dilutee by the atmospheric waters
than the salt contained in the compact rock (f clay slate.

It is most probable that this clay slate behngs to the Palteozoic epoch,
and that consequently the two Turkestan deerts have been upraised at a
very ancient geological period. As for the saids cemtaining remnants of
mollusks still inhabiting the Aral Sea, thej may have been, partly at

least, deposited at a time when the Caspiai and Aral formed a single

water-sheet.

In the whole steppe designed by the ollective name of Khiro-is
hSteppe, of which the Kizil-Kum and the Kira-Kum form only a part,

the desert a certain green appearance. In spring the hot days are followed

by cold nights, so that the difference between the average temperature of
day and night is enormous. In summer this difference is not so great, in

consequence of the intense heat of the sand. Dew has never been observed.

In the middle of September begin the long night frosts. In Januaiy the

--thermometer falls 86 degrees under zero Fahrenheit ( 38 Centigrade),

but there is little snow. In general, the climatic contrasts between the

Turkestan deserts and the French Sahara are much stronger than the

differences between their respective latitudes would lead one to expect.

Thus, for instance, there are about 12 degrees difference between the
latitude of Biskra and that of the Turkestan deserts, and still, at Biskra

frost is almost unknown, the mean annual temperature being 70 degrees.

     It is evident that, with such climatic discrepancies, the vegetation of
the Turkestan deserts, compared with that of the Sahara, must offer great

difference, but here also this difference is much stronger than it ought to

be, taking particulai'ly into account the high temperature of the Turkestan

summers ; and still, among the plants quoted in the above-mentioned
paper, there is not a single species common to the Turkestan deserts and
the Sahara. The flora of Kara-Kum seems to be so poor that, compared

with that of the Sahara, the Algerian desert appears sometimes like a

flourishing garden, particularly if we consider, not the large barren portions

of the central and western Sahai'a, but the region situated near the
northern boundary of the French Sahara, as among others, between Biskra
and the oasis of Sidi-Okba and Zadja, where I was struck by the variety

and beauty of very peculiar plants which, like brilliant jewels, glitter in

the midst of the sea of sand.^

    Now, if from the Turkestar deserts we direct our steps to the east^

we reach the long chain of moTintains which separate Siberia from Central

Asia, a chain composed of the mountain groups collectively called Altai,

Sayan, and Jablonovo'i, the tviO first of which I have visited, but without
crossing them, in order to descend into the desert of Gobi. This immense

--desert--the largest in the worH after the Sahara begins almost imme-

diately at the southern foot of the just-mentioned Siberian mountain
range, and extends to the soith to the chain of Kuenlun and its eastern

--ramifications, having from mrth to south about 1,800 miles, and about

4,000 miles from east to vest viz., from the mountainous chain of
Changan to the country of Tarkand. The geographical position of the
Gobi desert is, in the average,j)etween the .35th and 45th degrees of northern

--latitude, and consequently amost under the latitude of Italy a fact ren-

dering still more remarkably the climate of the desert, which exemplifies
in a most extraordinary wajj and even more than in the Turkestan deserts,

the influence of eastern longtudes, combined with the powerful radiation

of large, more or less flat, surfaces ; for, though under the latitude of Italy,

but about 40 degrees more \) the east, the Gobi offers the strongest con-
trasts between the seasons : iie summer reminding one of tropical heat, and
the winter of the cold of thdpolar regions, and that not only on account of

--its intensity, but also its dij-ation a fact of which Colonel Prejevalsky
--gives us the following striing example: In the mountainous tract of

Gansu, at a height of notmuch more than 3,000 feet, on May 16, the
thermometer indicated 25 ffigrees (--4░ Centigrade), and on May 28, the

snow falling copiously foriied on the soil a coating 5^ inches (16 centi-

metres) thick, and the thermometer sunk to 22'46 degrees (-- 5"3 Centi-

grade). Now, this winter manifestation occurred under the latitude of
38 degrees (consequently under that of Palermo), and what is equally-
very peculiar is, that it did not cause great harm to the vegetation, for

--the Colonel gathered at this very time 76 plants a curious example of

the elasticity which certain plants possess of accommodating themselves
to such extremes of temperature.

     As the distinguished Russian traveller has seen of the Gobi desert
more than any of his predecessors, I beg leave to quote his own woi-ds,
which give a graphic portrait of the desert ' : ' The general impression
produced by the Gobi on the traveller has something gloomy and oppres-
sive. During whole weeks the eyes repose on the same objects : unlimited

yellow-coloured plains, furrowed rocks or steep hills, on the top of which
one perceives sometimes the flying form of the antelope {Antilope gutturosa).
The heavily laden camels cross, with measured solemn steps, hundreds
and hundreds of miles, and still the desert does not change, keeping always
its stern and monotonous appearance. The sun sets, the dark shadows of
the night fall, the cloudless sky lights its million of stars, and the caravan

stops. Happy to get rid of their loads, the camels lie down around the
tents, and their drivers are occupied in preparing a frugal meal. One
hour more, and men and animals are soundly asleep, and all around reigns

the deathlike silence of the desert, as if no living creature were present.
Across the whole of Gobi, from Urga (near the Siberian frontier) to
Kalgan (near the frontier of China), there are, except the great post road
maintained by the Mongols, several other caravan roads which are usually
followed by the caravans carrying tea. Along the post road are stations
erected at certain distances, the total number of which amounts to 47

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

and each of these is provided with a well and with a certain number
of Mongol tents (Yurt), which represent our post-houses.'

     This long post-road between Urga, Kalgan, and Peking was, during a

long time, the only way by which travellers used to cross the Gobi in its
whole breadth from north to south. Bat in the numerous publications of
those travels, nothing is mentioned except the immense sand- accumulation,

without the least hint in reference to the solid rocks on which those sands
repose, or to any organic remains. In fact, it seems really that this
monotonous road does not offer any interest whatever, for even the sharp-
sighted Colonel Prejevalsky was not able to detect there anything of
scientific importance ; all he says of the country between Urga and the
frontier of China is, that the soil of the Gobi consists of reddish, coarse-
grained sand and pebbles belonging to different rocks. Fortunately,
when, after concluding his extensive travels, the Colonel returned to
Russia, he did not follow the trodden road from Peking to Urga, but took

a much more westerly one, so that he crossed the desert in a direction in

which it has never been visited previously, viz., from the mountains of

Alashan to Urga. He describes this part of the desert as having a very

undulated surface, and at certain points intersected by considerable heights
composed chiefly of porphyry. In a depression he observed gneiss cropping
out through the superficial deposits, and here and there this rock rising
like little islands amidst the sea of sand.

     Such denudations of the substratum are of the greatest importance

to our knowledge of the solid framework of the desert ; for if we could

ascertain that the rocks cropping out through the sand do not differ

geologically from those which compose the border mountains of the desert,

we should be induced to conclude that the one is merely a continuation of

the other. Therefore let us throw a glance on the mountains which form

the boundaries of the desert, beginning with the northern or Siberian side.

     Here, I have been able myself to ascertain the PalEeozoic age of the

Altai and the Sayan ranges,^ consisting chiefly of clay-slate, limestone, por-

phyry, &c., and it is probable that the Jablonovo'i chain, which is an

eastern continuation of the Sayan, belongs equally to the same age.

     The latest explorations of the Thian-Shan, or celestial range, the

various ramifications of which form the southern and western boundary

of the Gobi, tend also to prove that they are referable to an old geological

formation. Colonel Prejevalsky, who more than once crossed the moun-

tains of the south-eastern part of this boundary, mentions as the chief

rocks composing them, granite, syenite, granulite, porphyry, diorite,

mica-schist, clay-slate (ThonscMefer), chloritic schist and coal deposits.

These are the geological elements which, according to Colonel Preje-

valsky, constitute many of the marginal mountain ranges which he visited
between Kalgau and the lake Kuku-Nor. He mentions very extensive

coal-deposits in the mountains of Alashan, rising beyond 10,000 feet, as

well as in the mountains, which in Northern Tibet form the eastern

boundary of the Kuku-Nor. Those facts prove that the mountain range,
representing the south-eastern boundary of the Gobi (from Kalgan to the
Kuku-Nor) are composed of rocks which very likely belong to ancient

geological formations.

   A similar conclusion may be equally applied, with great probability, to

the long chain of Chingan, which can be considered as the eastern boun-

dary of the Gobi, and separates Mongolia from Manchuria ; for this chain

is intimately connected with the mountains of Inshan, one of the south-

eastern marginal mountains of the Gobi, which Colonel Prejevalsky

found composed of granite. At all events, all those mountains may be

considered as the eastern extremity of the long chain of Kuenlun, which,

according to Baron von Richthofen, is the largest and altogether the

oldest mountain-chain of whole Asia.

    We have, consequently, no lack of arguments in favour of a very

ancient formation of the Gobi, and we can admit that at the time when

-the mountains which surround the desert were upraised, the immense

space included in the interior precinct remained much lower, but still

sufficiently high to form one of the loftiest table-lands of the world,

the average height of which. Colonel Prejevalsky estimates to be near

4,000 feet (1285 metres), with local depressions sinking to about 3,000

feet.

      It is, therefore, probable that after its upheaval, this large surface has

never been covered by the sea, as little as the Sahara- Lybian desert
since the cretaceous and tertiary periods, or the Turkestan deserts since
the Palaeozoic epoch. Once more, in the Gobi, as in the other two deserts,

the    sand-accumulations  had  nothing  to  do  with  marine  deposits                                                they
                                                                                                                    ;

were chiefly produced by atmospheric agencies, and as far as the Gobi is

concerned, the frequent siliceous rocks, as granite, syenite, gneiss, &c.,

were particularly apt to yield sufficient materials to the formation of
quartz sands.

THE DESERTS OF AFRICA AND ASIA.  373

     After all I have said, it is superfluous to add that the upheaval of

those deserts did not take place at once, but successively, as we have

seen in the Sahara-Lybian desert, where the cretaceous and tertiary rocks
appeared, one after the other, leaving still large tracts occupied by
sea- or fresh-water basins, which were filled up only during the quater-
nary epoch, or even in a more recent one. Therefore, it is highly pro-
bable, that like the Sahara-Lybian desert, the Asiatic deserts were also
crossed, long after the upheaval of their chief portions, by gulfs, or con-

--tained numerous fresh-water basins a supposition which, in reference to

the Gobi, is supported by the interesting considerations of E. Regel, on
the character of the flora of Central Asia.' The learned director of the
Botanical Garden of St. Petersburg, says : 'The salt steppes and sand

deserts of the lower regions of Central Asia suggest the conclusion
that, even at the beginning of the present epoch, consequently during the
diluvial period. Central Asia was covered by a large fresh-water lake,

throngh which the mountains rose as so many islands, until the time
when the waters cut their way through the mountains, and were con-
veyed to the sea by the river Obi and perhaps the Amur, having left
behind them large dry salt and sand steppes, which contain now an uni-

form flora, composed of halophytes and palnstrian species, a flora which
has probably opposed serious impediments to the migration of plants.

As a striking exemplification of this fact we may quote the entire

absence in Central Asia of any rhododendron and of any lily, whereas

both these are copiously represented on the Caucasus, the Altai, in the
Baikalian and Dahurian regions, on the northern declivities of the

Tibetan Alps, and particularly in the Himalayan system. On the con-

trary. Central Asia appears a real vegetable centre for the genera
Tidi'im, Allium, Eremurus, Elymus, &c., and particularly for the family of

Saholacece.^

     The still unknown part of the Gobi desert belonging to the most

important regions of Central Asia, is so large, that all geographers and
natural philosophers must hail with joy any undertaking capable of
unveiling this terra incognita, particularly the mysterious western portion
of it, containing the extensive lake Lob (Lob-Nor), which receives so

many considerable rivers, like the Ak-su, Yarkand, Kashgar, and Kothan
rivers. The intrepid traveller, who recently explored for the first time
the Kuku-Nor lake, is certainly entitled, more than anybody else, to add
to his important discoveries this new revelation of Central Asia.

     The name of Colonel Prejevalsky is suflBciently known to all
geographers ; but what is perhaps not generally known and what en-

hances greatly the merit of this distinguished man, is the fact, that one
of the most remarkable explorations of modern times has been carried
out, with means the smallness of which would appear quite fabulous, had
he not himself mentioned them. Now, Colonel Prejevalsky informs us,^
that the whole amount of money he i-eceived from the Russian Govern-
ment in order to meet all the expenses of three years of exploration in un-

known and barbarous countries, was only 9,500 roubles, or about 1,100L
With this scanty support he crossed (from jSTovember 17, 1870, to Sep-
tember 19, 1873) nearly 18,000 miles, of which he mapped almost 9,000

miles.

     But how could he, under such conditions, perform such a task,

tantiilo tantum ?   Well, that he explains candidly himself                                                                                                                                                                             the revelation

is so curious that it deserves to be quoted in his own words.' ' I had no

means to take with me more than two Cossacks, and therefore my com-

panion (Lieutenant Pylzow) and I, we were obliged to load and unload

the camels ourselves, to take care of them, to gather fuel, &c. ; in one

word, to perform all the business of hard-working men. Neither could

I engage a Mongolian interpreter, and my Cossack was altogether my
interpreter, my workman, my shepherd and cook. Finally, our beggarly

misery (sic) exposed us frequently to hunger whenever our gun did not

procure us a dinner. After our return to Peking, I was much amused

to hear one of the foreign ambassadors ask, how I was able to carry with

me the bulk of Chinese metallic money, foreign money not being accepted
by the Mongols. What would the honourable diplomatist think, had he
known that at my starting from Peking I had with me no more than 230

Chinese Ian, or 55Z. 4s.'

But our astonishment increases still more when we learn that the

energetic appearance o( these four men, supported by their revolvers and

breechloaders, never seen before in those countries, produced such a deep

sensation and such a terror among the Mongols, that they considered

them at least as supernatural creatures, having unlimited power, and

being invincible by numbers. This kind of worship went so far that

when Prejevalsky entered the town Dnlan-kit, crowds of people ran to

see what they called the famous Ohybilgan (holy man) and all knelt at

his passage.^ Thus the poor Colonel, instead of being insulted as a

helpless foreigner and checked in his progress, was greeted as a divine,

irresistible magician, to whom everybody had to submit.

   We cannot refuse our deepest admiration to a man, who, almost

single-handed, explored, during three years, unknown countries, among

fanatic and predatory populations, and brought back with him enormous

collections, of which he gives us an enumeration,^ without spending much

more than 1,000Z.

At all events let us hope that such travellers may be found in the

future, for then we may be sure that the still unknown regions of our

globe will be rapidly discovered, and that such noble victories may at

last replace the bloodstained conquests of ambitious wan*iors.

' According to his own statement, the collections which Colonel Prejevalsky

brought to St. Petersburg, and which were transmitted to the Imperial Academy of

Sciences, in order to be worked out, consisted of 238 species of birds, represented by

1,000 specimens, 70 specimens of mammals and amphibians, 11 species of fishes, more

than 3,000 specimens of insects, 500-600 species of plants in 4,000 specimens, and a

STATE OF CRIME IN ENGLAND, SCOTLAND, AND IRELAND. 375

  State of Grime in England, Scotland, and Ireland in 1880.
                      By Professor Leone Levi, F.S.A.

[A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extcnso among

                                                                 tlie Reports.]

                                            [Plate IV.]

                             Д 1. Introductory.

Seldom has public attention been so intensely directed to tlie state of
crime as witliin recent years, the frequent reports of appalling murders
and other heavy offences, especially in Ireland, seeming to indicate that

national morals are not improving as one might expect. Is it, or is it not,

the fact that the spread of instruction and science is a safeguard against
crime, and that all the forces of civilisation tend to refine and elevate the
manners of the people ? Happily a question of such momentous impor-
tance is capable of being tested by numbers, and it is given to the
statistician to confirm or correct any hasty impression by the unanswer-

able logic of facts.

WeThe statistical method, however, is not free from diificulty.  may

gauge the criminality of a state by the enormity of the crimes therein

committed at any given time, by their number and frequency, by the
number of persons concerned in them, by the difficulty of detection, by

the shelter and support afforded to criminals, by the tone of the public press

with regard to crimes and criminals, or by the general character of the

circumstances connected with their occurrence. What, however, if the

crimes recorded should be altogether of a special charactex', the result, it

may be of a political revolution, or of war, famine, or agrarian grievances ?

In times of great aberration, as in France during the Reign of Terror

in 1791, or during the Commune in 1870, in Ireland in 1798 and 1821,

events occur and crimes are committed, which cannot be taken as
representing in any wise the ordinary criminality of the nation. At such

times the moral sense of large numbers seems corrupted and blunted,

passion and the lowest instincts appear to acquire complete sovereignty

over reason and conscience, aikd public sentiment is, for the nonce, al-

together in abeyance. There are, in truth, storms in the moral, as well

as in the physical, atmosphere, the results of which, however startling,

do not represent the ordinary state of morals, nor materially disturb the

normal progress of society.

To arrive at any solid conclusions from statistical observation, the

phenomena observed must embrace large numbers of facts, occurring over

a lengthened period of time, and operating under widely different circum-

stances. Nor can we take the records of crime in any country as a
complete or sufficient evidence of the morals of the nation, for the more

efficient are the means for the detection of crime, the stronger the evidence

that the moral sense of the nation rebels against it. Moreover, the moral

nature of an act is, unfortunately, of no value in determining whether it

is criminal or not ; for, on the one hand, an act may be grossly immoral
and yet it may not bring its agent within the pale of the criminal law, as

in the case of adultery. And, on the other hand, an act perfectly innocent

from a moral point of view, may render the doer amenable to punishment

as a criminal.
376 BEPORT-- 1882.

     The statistics of crime liave often given rise to tlie theory, that a

--propensity for crime is within us, and that in committing it the criminal

only follows a necessity of nature that free will is, in fact, powerless,

where a necessity, or fatality, really governs all our actions. Whence is it,

it is asked, that nearly the same proportion of crimes are committed every
year in proportion to population, and these in nearly the same proportion
as against the person and against property ? Buckle, in his ' History of
Civilisation in England,' said that free will is only a dream of weak minds

who obstinately refuse to admit that the world is held together by an
inexorable law of causality. Quetelet saw in man a being subject to the
action of certain laws which are beyond his power to control, knowing

what is in him, yet conscious of responsibility for what he is doing.
Wagner' represented the law of necessity which masters human actions as
acting to such an extent that whatever happens occurs independently of
the human will, and simply as a consequence of an absolute law. It is
true, indeed, that human society is bound together by a thousand threads,
and that every individual is affected by events which influence his con-
duct from his very birth ; but human actions do not exhibit that same
identity of character from age to age as the presence of such a law would
necessitate. The operative causes of crime are, moreover, not always the-
same, and they act more powerfully on the weak than on the strong.
Most certainly we are free to master them, and are even able to do so,,
if only by patience and endurance we acquire moral strength to conquer,
instead of being conquered by them.

                                                Д 2. Judicial Statistics.

     The record of ci-ime in the United Kingdom is embodied in the three

annual volumes of Judicial Statistics for England and Wales, Scotland,,
and Ireland, respectively ; those for England and Wales dating from 1856;
for Scotland, from 1868 ; and from Ireland, from 1863. All the three

fall considerably short of the plan, which I laid down in my paper on
'Judicial Statistics,' read before the Law Amendment Society, in 1855,

as the result of the recommendation of the International Statistical
Congress,^ in that they do not furnish the necessary particulars regarding
criminals in relation to the crimes committed. The Judicial Statistics
for Ireland have recently omitted a most valuable part, consisting of
the number of persons committed for trial in each county, for the use of

which in this paper I am indebted to the Irish Office in London. And

the Judicial Statistics of Scotland do not sufficiently distinguish indict-
able crimes from police offences, while differences of method and nomen-
clature render any comparison more difficult. Nevertheless, in these

documents we have ample materials for determining the amount and pro-
gress of crime in the United Kingdom, and it is from them that all tba
facts commented upon in this paper are derived.

                       Д 3. Population and Means of Repression.
     Tn order to appreciate the real value of the number of crimes and
criminals annually reported, we must first take into account the popula-
tion and number of police employed for the repression of crime, which
were as follows :
--378 REPORT 1882.

     The number of crimes reported in England and Wales -witliin the last
twenty-five years, was as follows :

Average             Per 1,000
                        2-72
                        2-47

should be allowed to offer an asylum to one who violates the law. The

majesty of the throne, the sacredness of the temple and of the altar are
exalted, not lowered, by the triumph of justice.' The proportion of crimes
to persons appi'ehended in England and Wales and Ireland was as follows :

       Number of Crimes           Number of   Crimes to Persons

                     Ireland.
         8,607

Evidently, therefore, a larger number of crimes remains undetected in
England and Wales than in Ireland, a fact which few would have antici-
pated. It should be remembered, however, that in many cases the same
offender commits more than one crime, and that cases occur where the
crime reported was not, in fact, committed.

     During the last twenty-five years the proportion of persons appre-
hended to the number of crimes committed in England and Wales has
been as follows :

Years
--380 EEPORT 1882.

     The decrease in the number of committals has steadily continued for

the last forty years, partly from a decided diminution of the heavier

crimes, but partly also from the fact, that many offences previously tried
by Sessions, are now disposed of summarily by magistrates.' The number

of committals and proportion to population were as follows :

total number of persons thus tried in the last ten years was as follows :

and other general statutes. Thus divided, the crimes and ofiences in the

three kingdoms are as follows :

                                      Д 12. Geography of Crime.

      If from a comparison of crimes and offences in the three kingdoms,

we pass to an examination of the criminality of the several counties

respectively, the field for study becomes wider and still more interesting.

We may trace a diagram of indictable crimes in England from Cornwall,

where there is the smallest number of committals, 0'21 per 1,000, to
Hereford, where there is the largest number, 97 per 1,000 ; in Scotland,
from (Drkney to Bute, 0'12 to 3'05 per 1,000 ; in Ireland, from Wexford
to Leitrim, 0"34 to 2' 72 per 1,000. Lawlessness and drunkenness, how-
ever, follow other lines. If we take the counties in geographical order,
the group of north midland and south-western counties have the least
amount of crime, the north-western group the highest. Of the three
Metropolitan counties, Middlesex and Dublin have a high degree of
criminality. Not so Ediuburgh. In lawlessness and drunkenness, how-
ever, Dublin and Edinburgh are much worse than Middlesex. Generally,
the agricultural counties have less crime than the manufacturing and
mineral counties. As a rule, crime follows closely the density of popula-

tion. Cornwall, with only thirty-seven persons to the square mile, has
less crime than Lancashire with 285 persons to the square mile. Great

centres of population always contain a large number of restless, ill-con-
ditioned men. They offer temptations, often irresistible, to wasteful
luxury. They engender disease and want, and with physical and moral
deterioration crime is nourished and fostered.

                                        Д 13. Bace and Crime.

    Much might be learnt also of the relation of ci'ime to races, if the

population of the different counties were properly classified as Celts,
Saxons, Scandinavian, &,c. The large proportion of crimes and offences
in places where the Irish are numerous indicates that nationality and race
have considerable influence upon the nature and number of crimes. The
Anthropometric Committee of the British Association have ascertained
that the people of the north and north-eastern counties are taller and
heavier than the people in the south and south-western counties, and
the geogi'aphy of crime shows precisely the opposite course. Putting the

one against the other, we find that the taller the people the less is the crime,
the shorter the people the more the crime. Nor is it a matter of surprise,
for where the people are taller and better grown, the result of favourable
conditions with respect to fresh air, exercise, and wholesome and suffi-
cient food, there the amount of ci-ime should be lower than wherever the
people are small and stunted.

     The nationality of prisoners during the last twenty-five years in Eng-
land and Wales has been as follows :

                                          Per cent, of the whole number.

                          Д 14. Crime and Want.

AThe motives of crime are not easily fathomed.                                         crime is often a

symptom of moral disease, an evidence of total incapacity to control our
grossest instincts. It is often associated with corporeal deformity, and

may be the result of inherited propensities. But it is too often produced
by circumstances connected with our social system. Some of the most
operative causes of crime are certainly greed, cupidity, and want. The

desire for acquisition is prominent in the English character. "Wealth

and comfort are sought after with much recklessness and disregard of

consequences, whilst tbe sense of want is keen. Poverty, whether real
or imaginary, affects the proper balance of the reason, suggests make-
shifts, leads to temptation. The poor, living in squalid habitations, and

surrounded by persons of low character, are easily brought to the very

verge of criminality. Of whom consists the bulk of our criminals ? Of

persons  having  no  occupation                                            of  common  labourers, whose  means  are
                                                                        ;

precarious of domestic servants, extravagant in their habits and utterly
                                                        ;

thriftless.

                          Д 15. Crime and Thrift.

Hence the relation of crime to savings and wealth is very intimate.

The number of persons committed for trial in England and Wales in

1880 was 19 per cent, less than in Scotland, and 53 per cent, less than in

Ireland. . And so, in almost equal proportion, the amount of deposits at

the Savings Banks Trustees and Post Office combined, in the same year,

in England and Wales averaged 30 per cent, more than in Scotland, and

73 per cent, more than in Ireland. Take the twelve most criminal coun-

ties in England, and compare them with the twelve least criminal, and

we find the latter having more in the savings banks and fewer paupers

than the former have. Prosperity goes hand in hand with virtue ; misery,
with temptation and crime. Encourage thrift, promote the economic wel-

fare of the masses, and you thereby operate the most effectively towards

the repression of crime.

The graphic table which accompanies this paper, and Table C in the

Appendix, exhibit the relation of crime to thrift in so far as it appears

from the Savings Banks' returns, though the results are by no means

uniform, especially from the fact that the amount in the savings banks is

      "by no means tbe sole evidence of thrift.                                        ....                     the

                                   Д 16. Crime and Education.

     The bulk of criminals are generally found to be illiterate, and no
wonder, for ignorance restricts the chances of employment, and renders a
person the easy dupe of designing men. Education elevates the mind,
raises the morals, enlarges the desire for the pure, and diminishes the
desire for the impure, brings within the reach of all the works of the
highest minds, and if it does not succeed in controlling the affections, it
has an important influence in turning them to what is noble and right.

Pear has been entertained that education may engender dissatisfaction

with the lower occupations of life, and that by creating a capacity for
greater enjoyments than the conditions of society enable the people to

obtain, education may increase instead of diminishing the restiveness of

the people, and thereby tend to the production of crime. But no such
fear need be entertained, for the field of human labour is ever widening,
and education offers resources and remedies which sweeten the acerbities
of life and tend to ennoble the commonest of human services. Again,
take the twelve most criminal counties in England and Wales, and you
will find them to contain more persons not able to read and write than

are to be found in the'twelve least criminal counties.

                                  Д 17. Crime and Drunhenness.

     To what extent drunkenness proves to be the direct or indirect cause
of crime is not easy to define. In the same manner as crime, drunken-
ness is often the effect of weak self-control, of want of moral power,
though oftener still of wanton dissipation and sensuous indulgence.
However produced, drunkenness unhinges the mind and is sure to be the

concomitant of vice and crime. An inordinate expenditure in drink is,
moreover, an immediate cause of mucb suffering and miseiy, and too
often casts the labourer to the workhouse and the prison. Alas, how
many hopes are blasted, how many families are ruined, through excess of

drink. The twelve most criminal counties in England and Wales have a
larger proportion of committals for drunkenness than the twelve least

criminal counties. And the twelve counties where there is the largest
number of cases of drunkenness, have likewise a larger proportionate
number of committals for indictable offences, and nearly double the

number of cases of lawlessness.

                              Д 18. Crime and Family Quarrels.

     Where the causes are fathomed to tlieir real source, family dissensions

are found to contribute a pretty large quota of crime. Property, un-

requited affections, unfaithfulness, and other quarrels, envenom the
family life, and the results are -an increasing number of divorces and
judicial separations in the civil courts, and of suicides and crimes in the
criminal. In France in 1870 15 per cent, of the crimes of poisoning,
arson, murder, and assassination were ascribed to domestic dissensions
and money disputes among relatives.

                           Д 19. Crime and the Criminal Classes.

      There is yet another cause of crime ever active, ever present ; the
existence of the criminal classes, some at large, some in prison, some
STATE OF CRIME IN ENGLAND, SCOTLAND, AND lEELAND.  387

adnlts, and some still youog in age though old in malice. The jndicfal
statistics give the number of these in England and Wales in 1880 at"70,338,

or in the proportion of 2" 77 per 1,000, and in Ireland at 8,991, or 1*69
per 1,000. The average number of prisoners during 1880 vras in
England 1-13 per 1,000; in Scotland 0-83 per 1,000; and in Ireland
0-62 per 1,000 of the population. Necessary and useful as a place of
punishment, the prison is fatal to the character of the prisoner. The

prison, alas, is a school, not of virtue, but of vice. Notwithstanding

every effort to soften its asperities, to isolate the prisoner, and make him
think, those who once enter the portals of the prison seldom, if ever,
come out of it untainted and reformed. But what fatuity does it seem
to make the prison the antechamber to the reformatory school. If the

reformatory school is to spare the child from the contamination of the

prison, why bring the child under an influence which will ever after

haunt his mind and destroy his spirit and independence ?

                   Д 20. Crime in the United Kingdom and France.

    A comparison of the state of cz-inie in the United Kingdom as a

whole with France gives unsatisfactory results. In the United Kingdom,
the total number of persons summarily disposed of by the magistrates,
and committed for trial was, in 1880, 1,043,000, or in a proportion of
29'62 per 1,000. In Prance, the total number of persons before the
Assizes, Correctional Tribunals, and Simple Police in 1879, was 636,000,
or 17-18 per 1,000. The total number committed for trial in the United
Kingdom for murder, attempt to murder, and manslaughter in 1880 was
808, or in the proportion of 0-023 per 1,000. In France, the total
number before the Court of Assize for parricide, poisoning, assassination,
infanticide, and murder in 1879, was 645, or 0-017 per 1,000. In the
United Kingdom, the total number of cases of drunkenness in 1 880 was
287.000, or 8-15 per 1,000 ; in France, the total number in 1879 was

63,000, or 1-70 per 1,000.

                                          Д 21. Criminal Reforms.

    The state of crime in the United Kingdom is not, I am sorry to say,
as favourable as we should like it to be. Doubtless we may congratulate

ourselves that, as compared with former years, there is a notable diminu-
tion of the heavier crimes, nevertheless the total number of crimes and
offences is large, and they are the sure symptoms of a grievous disease

in the body politic. What is to be done ? Sanitary science or hygiene
has done much to eradicate or modify physical disease. Jurispi-udence

and ethics must combine in the removal of those causes which contribute
to crime. Large indeed is the field open for the jnoral and social re-
former. In the improvement of the homes of the people, in the pro-
motion of health and comfort, of education, temperance, and self-control
among the masses, in the advancement of measures calculated to further

solid progress, much effort is needed, much perseverance, much faith.
Happily, large as is the field of labour, many are the labourers, who, by

means both of repression and prevention, are seeking to remove those

clouds which now obscure oar moral horizon, and we need not fear but

their labour will bo crowned with success.

                                                                  cc2

Ooi the Treatment of Steel for the Construction of Ordnance, and

     other purposes. By Sir William Armstrong, G.B., F.R.S.

[A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso
                                        among the Keports.]

The improvement whicli of late years has been effected in the manufacture

of steel, and the control which has been attained over the quality produced,

now seem to justify its exclusive employment in the construction of ord-

Wenance.       have, therefore, to consider what are the conditions under

which it can be most favourably used for that and other purposes.

There is at present much want of a proper definition of steel. The

term was formerly confined to iron containing a much higher proportion

of combined carbon than is to be found in the so-called mild steels of the

present day. Where steel ends in the downward scale of carbonisation,

and where iron begins, it is impossible to say, for not even wrought iron
is absolutely free from carbon. The chief distinction between iron and

--steel now seems to lie in the process of manufacture steel being operated

upon in a state of fusion, while iron is dealt with in a state of agglutination.
But, even in the mild state, steel, as thus defined, contains more carbon
than is generally to be found in wrought iron, and this excess, small as it
is, appears to exercise a very important influence upon its qualities. These
qualities have been very distinctly brought out in some investigations
I have recently had occasion to make on the welding, tempering, drawing,
and annealing of steel, and as the results possess a general interest inde-
pendently of gun-making I shall now place the substance of them before

this Section.

First, as to the adaptation of steel for welding. As a matter of every-

day pi'actice, we know that steel very low in carbon is capable of welding,

and it has frequently been maintained that, without departing from the

system of constructing ordnance known as the ' coil system,' great ad-

vantage Avould be realised by substituting mild steel for wrought iron in

the makino- of welded coils. Our distinguished President, Dr. Siemens,

who has taken such a leading part in the modern development of steel

manufacture, and whose knowledge of the metallurgy of the subject is not

surpassed by that of any other person, has held this opinion, and a few

years ago he supplied to my firm a sample of mild steel specially prepared

for this purpose. It was very low in carbon, containing only about yV^^i

Aper cent.     test piece cut from the bar as it came from the maker

showed the limit of elasticity, or point at which permanent stretch com-

menced to be 13'5 tons per square inch, being not much greater than that

of wrouo-ht iron ; and it broke at 23'3 tons, showing that its ultimate

strength was also very similar to that of iron, but its ductility was so

great that it stretched to the extent of 37'5 per cent, on a length of two
Ainches before breaking.
                          similar test piece tempered in oil had its

elastic limit raised to 24 tons per square inch, and it broke at 286 tons

per square inch, while its ductility remained nearly the same as before,

the elongation being 36 per cent, instead of 37'5. It will be perceived,

therefore, that the material was of a very fine quality, and if the results

attained with the tempered specimen could have been realised in a welded

coil, its superiority over wi'ought iron would have been very marked

indeed. Two welded coils of equal dimensions were made from this

material, and there was no appearance in either case of defect in the

welding. Both of these coils were tempered in oil, and one of them was

applied as a jacket to a steel cylinder closed at both ends and used for the

purpose of determining the pressure exerted by different charges of gun-

powder fired in confinement. An exact duplicate of this cylinder was

jacketted with a coil of wrought iron of the same dimensions as the steel

one, and the two cylinders were used in comparison with each other.

Much to our surprise, the cylinder with the steel jacket began to stretch

laterally under a pressure which produced no change in the wrought iron

coil. The experiment was considered conclusive against the use of steel
for welded coils, and no further attempt was made to use it for that

purpose.

myThe duplicate of this steel coil was laid aside, and  attention having

been lately recalled to the subject I applied myself to discover the cause

of the inferiority displayed after undergoing the process of coiling and

welding. I had a test piece cut from the coil in the lengthways direction

of the bar of which it was made, and I found the elastic limit was only

12'5 tons per square inch, against 24 tons in the previous tempered test

piece ; while the breaking point was 19'1 tons, against 28'6 tons in the
former case. The loss of ductility was still more decided, the elongation

being only 7"5 per cent, instead of 36 per cent. I then had a test piece

cut across the welds, and this broke, not at a weld, but through the

solid, showing that the welding was perfect. In this case the elastic limit

was 12 tons per square inch, the breaking point 20"1 tons, and the elon-

gation 6 per cent. To determine whether the deterioration which the

material had sustained was permanent, or whether the quality could be

restored, a portion of the welded coil was hammered out in length, and

reduced from a piece about 5 inches broad and 2 inches thick to a section

Aof 1 inch square.  test piece from this bar showed a complete restora-

tion of the fine qualities of the steel and a great accession of strength.

The limit of elasticity rose to 21 tons, the breaking point to 27 tons, and

the elongation to 86'5 per cent. It was remarkable, however, that after

this treatment no further increase of strength was obtained by a renewal

of the tempering process. The fracture of the test piece from the original

bar was slate-coloured, and of the character usually called fibrous. The

test pieces from the coil showed a coarsely granular fracture, but in the

restored state effected by hammering, the fracture again became slate-
coloured and fibrous.

     Thinking it possible that the coil might have been overheated in the
welding process, I had a pile made with a number of small slabs of the
restored material, and welded at a somewhat lower heat than had been
jipplied in making the coil, but test pieces cut across the pile invariably

failed at the junctions with a very insignificant strain, showing that the

welding heat could not be reduced consistently with sound welds.

In order to ascertain whether it was the heating or the hammering

that had injured the welded coil, I had a piece of the material cut from
the coil, and restored to a good condition by drawing under the hammer,

and then heated up to the welding point, and allowed to cool without
being hammered for welding. In this case the fracture showed no change

of crystalline structure, nor was there any decided alteration in quality

except that the hardening efiect of the hammering was removed. It
began to stretch at a low limit, namely 12 '-S tons per square inch, but its
--400

breaking point was 25'2, which was higher than in the original bar. The
elongation remained nearly the same, being 34 per cent., so that the
mere heating to a welding temperature without disturbing the particles
by hammering had no serious detrimental effect.

     I then took a piece of the steel in the restored condition, and after
heating it to the welding point, delivered upon it in that state a single

blow of a hammer sufficient to crush it into half its thickness. The

result was that the flattened piece divided into fissures all round the
edges. For the purpose of comparison, I took a piece of wrought iron
selected at random from a scrap heap, and treated it in exactly the same
manner. The result was that the iron bore the blow, flattening it to the
same extent as the steel, without showing the slightest fissure on the

edges. These two pieces are now on the table, and it is impossible to
examine them without perceiving that the steel, though difiering so little
from iron in the amount of its carbonisation, was yet, when heated to

the welding point, in a state of friability, while the iron remained per-
fectly plastic. The conclusion was thus confirmed that it is the dis-
turbance of the particles in this friable state, and not the mere heating,
which exercises the injurious effect in the welding process.

     I was not surprised to find that the coil itself had derived no benefit
from the tempering, because although steel, so low in carbon as this
sample, is considerably improved by tempering when the piece subjected
to the process is of small dimensions, yet when the bulk is considerable
the cooling in the oil is not sufiBciently rapid to produce any decided

effect.

    My next experiments were made upon a block of gun steel contain-

ing '^4 per cent, of carbon, which had been rejected on account of its

Adeficient tensile strength.  test piece cut from this block as received

from the maker began to stretch permanently at 11 tons per square inch,

breaking at 29*4 tons per square inch, with an elongation of 24'25 per

cent. ; but a piece of the same steel drawn out under the hammer at a red

heat from a thickness of 5 inches to a thickness of 1^ inches, resisted

19 tons instead of 11 without stretch, and a breaking strain of 33'2 tons

Aagainst 29"4, with an elongation of 27*5 against 24"25.  piece of the

same steel 5 inches long by 4 inches thick, having been tempered in oil,

gave a test piece which showed a further increase of strength, with little

diminution of ductility. It began to stretch at 23 tons, breaking at

36'5 tons, and elongating 21 per cent. Various attempts were made to

weld this steel in a pile of slabs, but it was found impossible to make

sound joints, and the steel was even more deteriorated than had been the

case with the previous sample ; but a piece of this material spoiled in the

attempt to weld it, having been drawn out into a bar of an inch square,

proved to be far stronger than in the original state. It stood 24 tons per

square inch before stretching against 11 tons in the previous untempered

state, and 33"6 tons before breaking against 29'4, but the elongation was

reduced from 2425 per cent, to 15 per cent. The fracture in this case

was of the same character as in the original test piece, and showed no

indication whatever of the previous injury it had sustained by the attempt

Ato weld it,  piece of the same block heated to a welding temperature,

and allowed to cool without hammering, gave a test piece which, so far

from showing any injury by the heating, resisted a considerably higher

strain than the sample taken from the block as it came from the maker.

Its stretching point was 16 tons per square inch, its breaking point 332

tons, and its elongation 20 per cent. Anothei- block of gun steel contain-

ing rather more carbon, namely -41 per cent., gave the following results.

A test piece cut from the block in its original state began to stretch at

14 tons per square inch, broke at 32-5 tons, and elongated 23 per cent.
The same cut from a thick lamp of the same material which had been
tempered in oil resisted 28 tons before permanent stretch, and 43 tons

before breaking, with an elongation of IG per cent., thus showing the

much greater effect of the tempering process where the proportion of

carbon is increased, but showing also that the loss of ductility by the

process becomes more considerable.

     It being important to ascertain whether cylinders which have been
tempered in oil could be reheated sufficiently for the purpose of shrinking
upon a gun, without destroying the eifect of the tempering, a test piece
cut from the same tempered lump of this steel was heated in melted zinc

to a temperature of 750░, and then allowed to cool naturally in air. Com-
paring its resistance with the piece which had not been reheated, it gave

25 tons per square inch against 28 tons before stretching, and 40-2 tons

against 43 before breaking, but its ductility was increased from 16 per

cent, to 20-5 per cent., so that although rendered slightly inferior in

strength, it was rendered more ductile and tougher by the reheating.

Similar experiments made with steel rather lower in carbon showed that

the effect of reheating to this temperature was almost inappreciable either

in the way of improvement or the contrary, and no degree of sudden

cooling from so low a temperature had any distinct effect. On carryino-

the reheating to still higher degrees the effect of the previous tempering

gradually diminished, but was not altogether obliterated even when the

temperature was raised to the bright red heat at which the steel had been
immersed in the oil for the purpose of tempering. The friability of the

steel at a welding temperature became more marked as the percentao-e

mof carbon was increased. Of the many samples I tried the highest

carbon was the block already mentioned, containing 41 per cent, of

carbon. This steel, like the milder samples, suffered very little from
being merely heated to the welding temperature, provided that while'so
heated it was not disturbed by hammering, but it was so friable at that
temperature that it broke into a mass of small crumbs under a moderate
blow of the hammer. It was remarkable, however, that the same blow

of the hammer which detached them from the block united them in a thin

cake on the anvil.

          Whether this friability at a high temperature can be corrected by

    combming other materials with it, is a point upon which my experience

I casts no light. If it can be so corrected without detriment to the material,
     the knowledge of how to do it will be an important acquisition to metal-

       lurgical science.

Many of my test pieces were taken from rolled steel hoops containino-

from -22 to -35 per cent, of carbon, and all of these showed much greater

tenacity than was exhibited by test pieces taken from forged blocks of

similar material. It is one of the characteristics of mild steel that it is

enormously increased both in strength and toughness by being drawn

out either by rolling or hammering, but especially by rolling, which is
more uniform in its action than hammering. There can be no doubt that
the process of rolling steel tyres may be extended to the production

of rolled hoops of great width, and the time may not be distant when
we may see a realisation of the prediction made many years ago by Sir

Frederick Bramwell, that we should eventually be able to produce in this
manner continuous umvelded cylinders for boiler- making purposes. Steel
cylinders thus made and tempered in oil will be in a highly favourable
condition for the construction of ordnance, but in order to make them

available for longitudinal as well as for lateral sti'engths it will be essential

to have them in much greater widths than existing machines are com-

petent to produce.

     All ductile metals derive additional strength bv beinsj stretched, but
steel does so in a pre-eminent degree. Roughly speaking its modulus of

elasticity may be taken as equal to xo'iTo'''Ii of an inch per foot for every

ton per square inch of tensional strain. This measure of elasticity applies
equally or nearly equally to all kinds of steel, but the range of elasticity
becomes greater as the strength is increased. Thus steel that will bear
20 tons without permanent stretch will retract y-|}yths of an inch per foot
of length on being released from its load, while steel that will bear 40
tons without permanent stretch will recover yj^^ths of an inch per foot on
the removal of the strain. So also if the weaker specimen which recovers
only yf7Qths of an inch be stretched to a point at which it will sustain 40
tons per square inch, it will be in exactly the same condition in regard to
elasticity as the stronger specimen which bore that load in the first

--instance that is to say, its range of elasticity will be doubled. This is a

very valuable quality, enabling the steel to gather strength as it yields to

an imprudent increase of load. As an illustration of the extraordinary
strengthening effect of stretch upon mild steel I may mention that a
sample of the steel taken from the welded coil to which I have adverted,
and which in its original state showed a tensile strength very slightly
exceeding that of wrought iron, sustained a load of nearly 85 tons per
square inch measured on the attenuated section of fracture.

     But much as steel gains in strength by the process of rolling it gains
still more by that of wire-drawing. No form of steel is comparable in
respect of strength and toughness to that which has been drawn into

the form of wire or riband, and in the case of its application in that form
to the strengthening of a cylinder it has the additional advantage of
admitting of being laid on with a more favourable adjustment of tension
than is practicable with a solid hoop of considerable thickness. Bat,
even with wire, the best tensional condition for giving strength to a
cylinder can only be approximately attained, owing to the fact, which is
commonly overlooked, that, in bending a wire over a cylinder, it is im-
possible to give the proper degree of stretch to both of its sides. The
outer side having a larger circle to describe must necessarily undergo
greater elongation than the inside, and in fact, unless the wire be laid on
at a far higher strain than would be necessary or beneficial in the case of
rings, the inside, acting as a fulcrum to stretch the outside, will assume a
state of compression which can only be taken ofi" by expanding the
cylinder after the wire has been laid on. The thinner the wire the less
will this disadvantage be felt, and for this reason a given area of section

is much better in the flat or riband form than either round or square.

Great additional strength is given to steel wire by tempering in man-
ganese, and the highest strength is attained by passing the wire repeatedly
through the die as a final operation after the tempering process. The effect
of this treatment is to put a very hard skin upon the wire, which, though
greatly adding to the strength, is very unfavourable for bending, and a
very slight injury to the surface greatly conduces to fracture. Ductility

is of paramount importance in wire that has to be coiled at a high tension
on a cylinder, and for this reason wire tempered a-fter instead of hefore
finishing is safer, though not so strong. If this wire be thick, judicious
annealino-, though it lessens the ultimate strain which the wire will bear,
raises in a very marked degree the limit of elasticity. I have found flat

steel wire of about -2 of an inch thick, and of great ultimate strength,
begin to stretch permanently at a tension as low as 25 tons per square
inch, Avhile after being properly annealed it would bear 35 tons before
permanent movement. The explanation of this curious fact is probably
to be found in the removal by the annealing process of contending states
of tension produced by the drawing or tempering on the inner and the
outer portions of the wire. This view is confirmed by the fact that, when
the thickness of the riband was reduced to somewhat less than half, this
advantage of the annealing process almost entirely disappeared, and the

wire was simply softened and rendered more ductile.
      Castings of steel, unhammered, are improved by being tempered in

oil in much the same degree as the foi-ged material. Test pieces cut
from a cast trunnion of steel gave the following results :-- Before temper-
ing the elastic limit was 16 tons per square inch and the breaking point

27-8 tons, the elongation in 2 inches being 7-5 per cent. After tempering

the elastic limit was 23 tons, the breaking point 377 tons, and the

elongation was 12-5 per cent., showing a great improvement under every
bead. The quantity of combined carbon contained in this specimen was
и36 per cent. The objection to the use of cast steel in the unhammered

form is that it is liable to unsoundness from air-bubbles ; but this, I

think, ought not to exclude its use for trunnion rings, which, from their
peculiar form, can only be very imperfectly forged. The unsoundness

from this cause would be greatly mitigated by casting under pressure, as

advocated by Sir Joseph Whitworth.

    There is much less sacrifice of ductility or toughness where increase

of strength is obtained by tempering than by increase of carbon, and, in
fact, the advantage of tempering in oil is so apparent, both in the case of

steel castings and of steel which has been either rolled or forged, that
there is strong inducement for engineers to avail themselves of the

process for increasing the efiiciency of the material in nearly all its

applications. The saving of the weight of material necessary for a given
purpose would amply repay the cost of the tempering, and in the case of
bridges of great span, where the strains are chiefly due to the weight
of the structure, independent of its load, the economy effected would be

far more than proportionate to the increase of tensile strength in the

I material.
        My experiments are not sufficiently extended to enable me to speak
      definitely as to the best proportion of combined carbon for steel to which

the tempering process is to be applied, but excellent results can certainly

be attained with steel containing "35 per cent, of carbon. If the masses

to be  dealt  with  are thin  less will  suffice                              if  thick,  more will be required;
                                                                           ;

but it is quite possible that the mode of applying the oil in the tempering

process might be improved so as to render it more efficacious where the

balk of the steel is large.

                                    The Channel Tunnel.

             By J. Clarke Hawkshaw, JI/.J.., F.G.S., M.I.C.E.

   [A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extcnscr
                                             among the Reports.]

                                             [Plates V., VI., VII.]

This year the Channel Tunnel Company sought to obtain powers from
Parliament to enable it to make a tunnel to connect this country with

France, by a railway beneath the Channel, and it deposited plans and pre-
pared a Bill for the purpose. The South Eastern Railway Company did

likewise. Neither Company obtained a hearing before Parliament, but

there have been preliminary inquiries by the Government, the results of
which are that they have announced their intention of submitting the
whole question to a Select Committee of both Houses, to be appointed
early in the next session of Parliament.

     The Channel Tunnel Company had proposed to make a tunnel begin-
ning in Dover and passing beneath the shore line, about two miles
eastwards of that town, at Fan Hole, near the South Foreland.

     The South Eastern Railway Company's plans showed a tunnel begin-
ning at the west end of the uudercliff which lies between Folkestone and
Abbot's Cliff, and which was to pass beneath the shore line, near Shake-

speare Cliff, to the west of Dover.

   A Submarine Continental Railway Company was incorporated this

year to purchase certain works belonging to the South Eastern Railway,
consisting of two shafts, sunk on the foi-eshore, near Abbot's Cliff and
Shakespeai^e Cliff, in the lower beds of the chalk, and a mile or there-
abouts of headings driven in the lowest beds of the same formation.
Nearly everything that has been heard during the last twelve months

about a Channel Tunnel has emanated from this Company, who maintain
that the part of the coast on which the South Eastern Railway Com-

pany's works lie is the only place from which the tunnel can be made.

     The Channel Tunnel Company has remained silent, relying on au

opportunity of proving its case before a Parliamentary Committee. That,

hitherto has been denied to it ; but the following facts may show that

the Channel Tunnel Company's proposal is worthy of consideration, and
that the question has not at all been settled by the South Eastern Rail-

way Company's operations.

   --The Channel Tunnel Company was incorporated ten years ago in

--January, 1872 when it had already existed in the less ambitious form of

a Committee for four years, viz., from 1868 to 1872, and it comprises

among its supporters and advisers those who, nearly seventeen years ago,

carried out the first practical investigations, both geological and engineer-

ing, which were undertaken with a view to ascertain where and how a
tunnel could be made beneath the Channel. Geological surveys were
then made which determined the identity of the beds on the two sides
of the Channel. The continuity of the same beds across the bottom of
the Channel was determined by a sounding apparatus, which brought up
specimens from the bottom. The thickness of the chalk was ascertained
by borings 500 feet deep, made through it on the tiro coasts; and a
machine, made by Mr. Brunton, for excavating chalk was tested, and
was found to work as rapidly and as efficiently as the machine lately used

between Folkestone and Dover, of which so mucli has been said. All the

geological work  was      done  in                                    the  years   1865-7                                     the  machine was  tested
                                                                                                                           ;

in 1870.^ Moreover, this same Channel Tunnel Company originated the

French Company, and supplied the plans on which their concession was

obtained in 1875. Investigations which have since been made have con-

firmed the results of these earlier inquiries, but have added no new facts

of much importance from an engineering point of view.

   Having given so much of the history of this Company as seemed

necessary, I will now proceed to the general question of the tunnel.

     I shall pass by the political, and, in great part, the military side of the

--question but the latter cannot be overlooked by the civil engineer, as

the terminal point of the tunnel will, in this country, have to be deter-

mined by military considerations.

   APrimarily, the Channel Tnnnel question is a geological one.                                                                                 know-

ledge of the geological conditions of the ground to be passed through is

absolutely necessary for the successful execution of a tunnel under the

Channel.

   Monsieur Thome de Gamond was the first engineer who worked at the

geological part of the question. With admirable energy and perseverance

he devoted much time to the study of the geology of England and France,

not confining his labours to the coast line, but continuing them inland.

Unfortunately he failed to realise the insuperable difiBculties of making a

tunnel under the Channel through the formations below the chalk. The

result of his labours was the proposal to make a tunnel under the Varne

from Folkestone to Cape Grisnez, through the Wealden and Oolitic for-

mations. Monsieur Thome de Gamond had not neglected to consider the

possibility of making a tunnel through the chalk further to the east.

He was led to select the line under the Varne, in the belief that, by

sinking a shaft on the Varne, the tunnel could be attacked at four points

instead of two, and so the work could be more quickly done. In this, I

think, most engineers will now agree he was mistaken, and that a tnnnel

is not practicable on the line which he adopted. In later years M. Thome

de Gamond was associated with those who proposed a tunnel through the

chalk, and he signed the plans for such a tunnel, on which the French

concession was obtained in 1875. It was in the year 186G that he pi'o-

posed a tunnel under the Varne.

   For some years before this time. Sir John Hawkshaw had been con-

sidering the practicability of a tunnel under the Channel. His large

experience in tunnelling led him to see the facilities which the chalk

would offer for making such a tunnel. Early in 1865 he obtained the

services of Mr. Hartsinck Day, an accomplished geologist, who possessed a

knowledge of surveying. Mr. Day spent several months in that year in

examining and surveying the cretaceous and underlying beds on the Eng-

   and French coasts, and prepared for him a geological map, showing

the position of those beds along the two coasts. He, moreover, made a

Ilicsonhjecture as to their position on the bed of the intervening sea. This

   --survey confirmed the fact in so far as it was then known from the writings

   --of W. Philips, De la Beche, and others that the chalk strata overlying the

gault are almost identical, bed for bed, on the two coasts.

   ' Trials were made with Mr. Brimton's machine in the grey chalk at Snodlancl on

many occasions. On the 8th September, 1870, it excavated aheading 7 feet in diameter

at the rate of 44 inches  per hour                                    on the 20th  January,  1871, the rate was 45 inches an
                                                                   ;

hour, and on the 25th February, 1871, it was 49 inches an hour.

:
406 liEPORT-- 1882.

    To supplement Mr. Day's work, in so far as it related to the Channel,
Sir John Hawkshaw employed Mr. H. M. Brunei to take soundings across

the Channel, and to ascertain, as far as possible, the nature of the material

forming the bottom of the sea. An apparatus was devised for the purpose,

by means of which specimens of the sea-bed were obtained. It was found

that, instead of the sea-bottom being composed of loose transported

material, it was mostly formed of rocks, in situ, similar to those seen on

the adjoining coasts. This marine survey, carried out in 1865 and 1866,

determined the continuity of the upper cretaceous beds across the Channel.

It did not confirm Mr. Day's conjecture as to the position of the beds

throughout. Specimens of chalk brought up from the bottom showed

that the outcrop of the gault near the English coast lay further to the

west than Mr. Day had placed it.

It was still necessary to ascertain whether the thickness of the lower

beds of chalk, which had been measured in the cliffs on both coasts where

all the beds are exposed, was maintained after the lower beds disappeared

beneath the sea. Accordingly Sir John Hawkshaw detei-mined to bore

through the chalk, at two points, on the English and French coasts-

respectively. In this costly operation he was assisted by the late Mr.

Brassey, Mr. Wythes, and Messrs. Easton. The points selected for the

borings were St. Margaret's Bay in England, distant 4 miles east of

Dover and about 8 miles east of the outcrop of the lowest chalk beds

on the coast, and Ferme Mouron in France, 2^ miles west of Calais and 4

miles east of the outcrop of the same beds on the French coast. These

borings showed that the thickness of the lower chalk does not diminish

to any extent as we follow it eastwards from the outcrop.

Thus, by the year 1867, the geological information was obtained which

was thought to be necessary by Sir John Hawkshaw, Soon afterwards

he prepared plans for the Anglo-Fi-ench Committee, in conjunction with

Mr. Brunlees and M. Thome de Gamond, showing a tunnel through the

chalk from St. Margaret's Bay in England to Ferme Mouron in France.

A(Line on Plan, PI. V.)

In 1868 the Anglo-French Committee applied for a concession from

the French Government, and a commission was appointed that year in

France to examine the question. After various inquiries, and a long

correspondence between the two Governments, a concession was obtained

Ain France.  further series of geological investigations was then begun.

These were made by French geologists and engineers. I may here remark

that before granting the concession, which imposed very onerous condi-

tions on the French Company, their Government obtained a declaration

from the Government in this country that the latter did not object to a

tunnel in principle. They, moreover, waited until our Parliament had

passed a Channel Tunnel Bill authorising the Channel Tunnel Company

to carry out certain preliminary investigations.

The French Company were bound by their concession, obtained in

1875, to spend 80,000Z. (2,000,000 francs) in preparatory works of all

sorts, such as investigations, pits, galleries, borings, &c. The conduct

--of these operations was entrusted to a Committee, presided over by M.

Lavalley so well known in connection with the Suez Canal works. The

geological work was assigned to MM. Potier and de Lapparent, mining

engineers and able geologists, and they were assisted by M. Larrouse,

Hydrographer to the French Navy. They began by repeating and ex-

tending, on a more elaborate scale, the marine survey made ten years

before by Sir John Hawksbaw. Using an apparatus of the kind already-
mentioned, they succeeded in bringing up a great number of specimens

of the rocks forming the sea-bed. These soundings confirmed, in all

material points, the old survey. In addition, owing to the great number
of soundings that were taken, and to the number of specimens from the
bottom that could be identified, it became possible to plot, with some
accuracy, the junction of the lower chalk and gault from shore to shore,

except for a short distance where those beds pass beneath the sands of
the Vai-ne. In addition to the marine survey, a second boring was made

-- --at Sangatte, and the results of this work done in 1875-6 were published

in 1875-7, in the form of reports, with maps and sections. Since then

--the French Company acting under the advice of M. Lavalley and M.
--Raoul Duval have sunk two shafts a little to the west of Sangatte, and

have driven some short headings, in different directions, through the

lower beds of the lower chalk, and they are now driving two longer

headings by machinery. This is being done for the purpose of defining

the position of the gault and lower beds of chalk.
    The researches by the French Company have as yet brought no very

novel facts to light, such as to disturb the main conclusions which had
been previously arrived at in this country, but they have made our know-

ledge more definite in several particulars. Their survey shows that there
is no break in the line of the outcrop of the gault, such as would be

caused by any large fault. It attempts to define the position of the

outcrop of the various divisions of the chalk. The position of these

outcrops, on the plan accompanying the French Report (1877), indi-

cates a considerable depression in the chalk beds, extending along and

not far from the English coasts. Mr. Topley, of the Geological Survey

of England, who reported to the Channel Tunnel Company, in 1878, on

the French investigations, inclines to think that the view of the French

geologists, with regard to the existence of such a depression, is correct.

He thinks, moreover, that we may take the position of the outcrop of

the gault, as it is shown by them, as being, for all practical purposes,
accurate. It diSers from that suggested by Mr. Day ; but the marine

survey made for Sir John Hawkshaw had already shown that the chalk
probably extended near the English coast much further to the west than

Mr. Day had ahown it. We must remember that Mr. Day, in laying

down the position of the beds across the Channel, had no other data than

he could procure from a study of them on the two coasts.

Since 1880 the South Eastern Railway Company has been carrying

on expei'imental works between Folkestone and Dover. It has sunk

Atwo shafts, one near Abbot's Clifi" and one near Shakespeare Clifl".  third

shaft is being sunk to the east of Shakespeare Clifi". Headings have been

driven from the first two shafts, in directions more or less parallel with

the cliff, in the lower beds of grey chalk.

The above account is a brief summary of the geological work done up

to the present time in connection with the Channel Tunnel question.

As English and French geologists do not employ the same terms in

describing the principal divisions of the chalk, I have given a comparative

table, showing the divisions recognised in the two countries (see p. 419).

Before leaving the geological part of the question, I will refer briefly

to the information that is available, and may be of use in discussing the

question of the tunnel, but which has been collected by geologists, not

for that purpose, but in furtherance of their own science. Early in this
408 REPORT-- 1882.

century the atteution of geologists was given to the chalk cliffs forming
the south coast of England. Mr. "W. Philips read a paper before the
Geological Society of London, in 1818,^ describing the various beds of
chalk, showing how constant they were in character and composition at
points far apart, and, moreover, that corresponding beds were found on
the French coasts of the Channel. These views were confirmed by Tie la
Beche, in 1821.'- Mr. Hopkins, in 1857, in his account of the structure
of the Wealden district and the Bas Boulonnais, deals with the dis-
turbances which affected these beds, as well as others, in the south-east of
England. The eastern boundary of his ' disturbed district ' passes from
Abbot's Cliff to Cape Grisnez, just missing the area which any tunnel
through the chalk must traverse. Mr. F. G. H. Price contributed a
valuable papei-, in 1876, on the gault and upper chalk near Folkestone;
but it is to Mr. Whitaker and Mr. Topley, of the Geological Survey, that
we are indebted for most of the facts, which have been acquu-ed during
late years, respecting the beds in question, which facts have been pub-
lished in the memoirs of the Geological Survey and elsewhere.

     In France, Prof. Hebert, Dr. Barrois, M. Potior, and others have

added much to our knowledge of the cretaceous beds in that country.
     In a few words, the following is a summary of our geological know-

ledge of the question, as regards the chalk. This is the only formation

we need consider, for no other offers equal advantage for the construction

--of a tunnel. Indeed, through no other formation is a tunnel jiracticable,

taking all things into consideration :

      Identical beds of chalk are exposed above the gault in the cliffs on
the two sides of the Channel. These beds are, on the two shores, similar
in composition, contain similar fossils, and vary but little in thickness.
Taken as a whole, they have a slight dip to the north-east. They have
been found to pass uninterruptedly across the bed of the Cliannel. Borings
have shown that the lower beds increase rather than diminish in thickness
as they dip below the sea-level to the eastward of their outcrop.

                                    Position and Line of Tunnel.                  i

     It will be necessary to assume certain requirements to be fulfilled by
the tunnel before proceeding to discuss on what line it will be best to
make it. I shall assume that

     1. It will communicate with existing railways in the ordinary way
             by continuous railway, and not, as has been suggested, by shafts
             and hydraulic lifts.

     2. It will be provided with a means of drainage by gravitation to the
             shore. That is, the water met with in the tunnel should be able
             to flow by gravitation from the summit level in mid-channel to
             the shores of the two countries. This is necessary for safety
             during construction, and for drainage afterwards.

     3. It will be made for two lines of way, and be so designed as to be
             capable of being worked by ordinary locomotives.

     4. The gradient will nowhere exceed about 1 in 80.
     Geology has told us the kind of strata which will be met beneath the
Channel. The experience of engineers gained in past works can alone
determine through which of these strata, and through what part of them,

it will be best to pass. Before attempting to do so due consideration

should be given to the following questions :

     1. What are the military requii-ements with regard to the tunnel ?
     2. Where must the tunnel end inland in order to give the best

             accommodation to existing railways ?

    3. What are the most favourable strata for the tunnel works ?
    4. On what line will any error in our geological calculations be of

           least moment?

      5. "Which is the shortest practicable submarine line ?

     The problem, in so far as it depends on surface features of the land
and geological conditions, is very different in the two countries, being
simpler in France. The points where the tunnel can pass under the
shore-line in France are limited by geological conditions to the part of
the coast which lies between the Ferme Mouron on the east (where the
boring was made in 1867) and Sangatte on the west, a distance of about
2 miles. The country, for some way inland throughout this distance, is
low and flat, and, probably looking to military requirements, or to com-

munications with existing railways alone, it is not very material, within

these limits, where the tunnel first reaches the coast. The point may be

determined wholly by engineering and geological requirements.

     The case is very different and much more complicated on the English

coast. Geological conditions will admit of the tunnel passing under the
shore-line anywhere between St. Margaret's Bay on the east and Shake-

speare Cliff on the west, a distance of 4h miles. With the exception of
the valley of the river Dour, which enters the sea at Dover, the land
along this part of the coast is high, bounded by chalk cliffs from 200 to

600 feet high.
     Such being the nature of the coast, there are only three places where

--the exit from the tunnel can be made in the valley of the Dour near

Dover, inland in the chalk escarpment to the north of Folkestone, and in
the landslip between Abbot's Cliff and Folkestone. In the first case the
tunnel would pass under the shore-line to the cast of Dover, and in the
two latter cases to the west of Dover. At the last-mentioned place,
between Abbot's Cliff and Folkestone, the tunnel on the South Eastern
Railway has been partially destroyed by a landslip, and the line was
blocked for some weeks near Abbot's Cliff by a fall of the chalk in 1876.
This part of the South Eastern Railway is liable to be obstructed at any
time by larger landslips. For this reason it would be out of the question
to place the tunnel mouth on such treacherous ground, even if the place
satisfied other requirements, such as facilities for the defence of the

tunnel, and for communication with existing railways. Similarly, if the

tunnel exit were in the chalk escarpment to the north of Folkestone, it
would be near no fortified place, nor could junctions be conveniently

made with existing railways. Moreover, this position would necessitate

at least 6 miles of land tunnel, in addition to a longer sea tunnel, than

from any point of the shore further to the east. The valley of the Dour
alone remains to beconsidei-ed. The tunnel mouth can there be placed at
a moderate height above high-water level, which means a shorter length
of tunnel and better gradients between the tunnel mouth and the lowest

point of the line beneath the sea ; it can be placed either within or with-

out the fortifications, as the military authorities may require ; and, as

the existing railways terminate at Dover, they can with ease be con-

nected by short railways with the tunnel line. It remains to be seen
410 REPORT-- 1882.

whether the engineering and geological requirements are as compatible
with its terminating at Dover as at the only two other possible places.

     I have stated that if the tunnel terminates at Dover it must pass
under the shore-line to the east of Dover. This must be so for the
following reasons. If we take a gradient of 1 in 80, and assume that the
level of the rails where the tunnel passes below the shore-line at low-
water mark cannot be less than 100 feet below the surface of the fore-

shore, we then require a distance of at least two miles between the point
where the tunnel passes under the shore and its mouth inland, supposing
it to terminate at a point not much above high-water level. The higher

its terminal point is above that level to a greater degree will the required

distance exceed two miles. From this it will be seen that, if the tunnel
passes under the shore-line to the west of Dover, that is, between Dover
and Shakespeare Cliff, it will, if it is to terminate in Dover, have to make
a useless circuit of two miles inland. But further than this, the sole

advantage which it can be alleged is to be gained by crossing the shore-
line west of Dover is that of remaining in certain lower beds of chalk,
which have their outcrop near Folkestone, some six or seven miles to the
west of Dover ; now, this advantage, if it be one, can only be secured by
placing the tunnel mouth on the outcrop of the beds in question, that is,
in the Folkestone Landslip or on the chalk escarpment to the north of
Folkestone. That is to say, the sole reason alleged for going west of

Dover precludes the tunnel terminating near that town. From these

considerations it will be seen that, if the tunnel terminates in the Valley
of the Dour, it should cross the shore-line to the east of Dover, and there

are other and far more weighty reasons why the tunnel should leave our

coast to the east of Dover.

     The 25lans deposited by the Channel Tunnel Company, this session,
show the sea tunnel to begin at Fan Hole, which lies a short distance to
the west of the South Foreland Lighthouse. The first line laid down by
Sir .Tohn Hawkshaw, in 18G7, left our coast near the same point. It was
afterwards moved to St. Margaret's Bay, further to the east, and was so
shown in the plans on which the French concession was obtained. In
both cases the tunnel was shown to pass in a direct line to the Ferme
Mouron in France.

     Now, a line drawn from a point about half a mile east of Fan Hole,
to a point about half a mile to the west of the French works at
Sangatte, is the shortest line between the two countries, measured from
low water to low water, and is about 20^ miles long. From Fan Hole to

the Ferme Mouron, in a direct line (Line B on Plan, PI. V.), is 21^ miles,

and from the same place to the boring made in 1876, near Sangatte, is
20| miles (Line No. 1 on Plan, PL V.). Practically this last is as short
a line as can well be obtained. For to move the point of departure east-
wards in England would be to lengthen the land tunnel in order slightly
to shorten the sea tunnel, and geological conditions prevent onr moving

the line further to the west in France.

     As we move the point of departure on the English coast to the west,
we increase the length of the most direct line to the Fi'ench coast, and as
we move it to the west of Dover this length is rapidly increased, for the
tunnel cannot be made in a straight line from any point in England, west
of Dover, but must be made in a curve, deviating considerably from the
most direct line. Thus from Fan Hole, or thereabouts, the shortest line
for the sea tunnel is obtainable ; again, as Fan Hole is distant a little

over two miles from Dover, it is, afc the minimum distance, required to
pass with a gradient of 1 in 80 from the mouth of the tunnel to the re-
quired depth below the shore-line, and thus we get the shortest possible
land tunnel. I think that, so far, it has been shown that everything is in

favour of the tunnel terminating in the Valley of the Dour, and passing

beneath the shore-line near Fan Hole. It remains to be seen how far
these advantages are outweighed by any geological conditions aiForded by

the Folkestone route.

The only reason which has been given for taking the tunnel under the

shore-line to the west of Dover is, that by so doing it can be made wholly

in the lowest beds of chalk. It is asserted that no water, or very little,
Wewill be found in these lower beds. Now what are the facts.
                                                                                                              are told

that little water is found in the heading from Shakespeare Cliff ; that may

be so, as far as it has gone. In the headings driven at Sangatte, in the
corresponding beds in France, water is met with flowing from fissures at

the sides and bottom, and not confined to one place, but throughout the

--headings. The quantity which I saw was not large the largest spring,
--perhaps, 30 gallons per minute but it is enough to prove that those

beds are not impermeable ; and no one can assert that where small water-

bearing fissures exist, larger ones may not be met with. In the region
where a tunnel is possible, the only other evidence we have as to the

water-bearing qualities of these beds below sea-level, is that obtained from

small borings, few in number, and not of much value as compared with
the evidence derived from headings and shafts through the beds. Above
the level of the sea we can study the beds at many points. I do not

attach much value to deductions as to the probable condition of the beds

below the sea-level, made from their observed conditions above the sea-

level, for the constant movement of the land waters, from the highest
levels to the points where they are discharged into the sea, must produce

well-defined drainage-channels underground, which need not necessarily

exist at greater depths where there is no such rapid circulation. Still, as

much has been made, especially by the French engineers, of evidence

derived from observations on the zones from which water is discharged

on land, I will give a few facts relating to them. In France water may

be seen to flow in many places from the lower beds of chalk, where they

appear in the cliffs, between Escalles and St. Pot. I saw water flowing at

the very junction of the lowest beds and the green sand. There are some

large springs near Escalles, which, on the section accompanying the

French Report (1877), are shown at about 60 feet above the upper
green sand. The section shows Lydden Spout on the same horizon, but

that copious and well-known spring, on the coast between Folkestone and

Dover, issues, according to Mr. F. G. H. Price, who carefully measured the

cliff section near it, at the top of the so-called ' cast bed,' about 32 feet

above the upper green sand, or 46 feet above the gault. Therefore, if

this evidence is worth anything, it shows that, on the French side, water

might be met with largely,  60 feet above the  green sand                                                     or, allowing 36

feet for the depth occupied by the tunnel and its masonry, 24 feet only

above the tunnel, supposing it to be di-iven continuously along the top of

the green sand. On the English side, as the water is found only 32 feet

above the green sand, the top of the tunnel would be in this water-bearing'

zone, on the same assumption. It is needless to say that no railway

tunnel could be driven along the top of one bed, following all its flexures.

Thus, if the evidence from the permeability of the strata on land proves
--412 REPORT 1882,

anything, it is that a tunnel driven in the lowest beds of chalk must come

very near a bed from which large springs are discharged on land, and that

it will probably have to pass into this bed. I may here remark that it is

a fallacy to suppose that if a heading were driven across the Channel in

one bed, without meeting with water, it would prove that a tunnel could

be driven on the same line equally free from water. The vertical depth

of a heading is only 7 feet, that of the excavation for a tunnel would be

at least four times that depth. In the Severn Tunnel works, headings

have been driven in perfectly dry strata, yet, when the same have been

enlarged for the full-sized tunnel, large quantities of water have been met

with in the adjoining strata.

It has not only been asserted that very little or no water will be met

with in the lowest beds of chalk, but also that so much will be met with

in the higher beds as to make it impracticable to tunnel through them.

Large numbers of wells have been sunk all over the country, and other

excavations have been made at all depths and in all parts of the chalk

formation for the purpose of obtaining water, and our knowledge of the

mode in which water occurs in that formation is fairly complete. Much

has been written on the subject. Professor Prestwich treats of it in his

work on the water-bearing strata of London,' and gives references to
earlier writers, but much information has been gained on the subject since

the date of Professor Prestwich's work. In the ' Proceedings of the

Institution of Civil Engineers,' from the year 1839 down to the present
time, numerous papers on the water-bearing qualities of the chalk may be

found, and in the discussions which followed them the most eminent

geologists of the day, Dr. Mantell, Dr. Buckland, Professor Ansted, and

others, took part.

The following are, I believe, well-established facts on the subject in

question.

Solid chalk absorbs a large amount of water, but it parts with it with

extreme slowness, so that it cannot be said to be truly permeable. It is

only from the fissures which traverse the chalk formation, and from the

cavities found along its planes of stratification, that water can be obtained.

At a variable depth below the surface of the land the body of the chalk is

saturated, and such fissures and cavities as may occur there are full of

water, not stationary, but slowly flowing from the higher ground inland,

towards the I'iver valleys and sea-shore, where the water can find an

outlet. Thus, there is a circulation of water underground, just as there is

above ground on other less porous formations. Moreover, as the streams

and watercourses on the surface are independent of one another, so are the

underground channels in the chalk. If, in excavating chalk, a fissure is

cnt across,  a certain  supply of  water may be obtained                                                                                                        if a second  fissure

is cut through, a further supply may be obtained ; and genei-ally it will

be found that if the water is pumped from one fissure, it does not imme-

diately diminish the flow from adjoining fissures ; and, in like manner, if
the flow of water from one fissure is checked, it does not necessarily

increase the flow from those adjoining. In course of time, lowering the

water-level at any fissure will affect the supply to adjoining fissures, inas-

much as all draw    their  supply from  the  same  saturated                                                                                                    mass  of     chalk

its water, unless there is direct communication between two fissures,

operations at one do not generally affect the others. Now this property

of the chalk is of the greatest importance in carrying out engineering

works which require excavations to be made through the water-bearing

levels in it, for it enables the engineer to deal witli the water in detail.

Fissure after fissure may be cut through as long as the water flowing from

them leaves a sufficient margin                                                                  of unused pumping power                                                                                                                                               as soon as the

yield of water becomes so great as to diminish that margin unduly, some

of the fissures may be blocked up with temporary or permanent work.

Thus it will be seen that, in tunnelling through chalk, a very large

volume of water might be dealt with if it entered the work by separate
Achannels.
            very large body of water entering at one point might give

trouble, and I shall accordingly select some facts from the very large

number available, to show tliat from no one area of chalk, even of con-

siderable extent, much less from one fissure, has a supply of water been

derived larger than could easily be dealt with, or which at all approaches

the volumes which have been dealt with on works completed or now in
progress. At Goldstone Bottom, one of the pumping stations of the

Brighton Waterworks, a greater quantity of water is obtained than at

any other locality known to me. Mr. Edward Easton, the best authority
on this subject, has kindly furnished me with some particulars respecting

these works. There are engines at Goldstone Bottom capable of raising

300,000 gallons an hour, or 5,000 gallons a minute, but it has been neces-

sary to make a length of 1,800 feet of tunnels to obtain the required sup-

ply. These are at right angles to the fissures, which here, as is so often

the case, are at right angles to the shore-line. At Lewes Road, another
of the Brighton pumping stations, there are engines capable of lifting
280,000 gallons an hour, or 4,666 gallons a minute, to supply which

2,400 feet of tunnels have been made. Mr. Easton tells me, and this is.
the important point, that the water in those tunnels is under complete
control, so that any one of them can be laid dry at any time of the

year.

The work which has tested to the fullest our power to tunnel through

the wettest parts of the chalk is the Brighton intercepting sewer, for

which Sir John Hawkshaw was engineer. The main sewer is more than.

7 miles long. The outfall is placed on the coast, about 4 miles to the

east of Brighton                                                                           and,  throughout a distance of  about 41 miles, a tunnel,,
                                                                                        ;

from 9 to 10 feet in diameter, was excavated in the upper chalk, along the

base of the cliff, and close to the shore. Being below high- water level, it

cut through all the fissures which discharge the drainage of a large tract

of inland chalk country. Large fissures were cut through, which I had

frequent opportunities of inspecting, and, moreover, of seeing the perma-

nent work successfully carried across them. The greatest quantity of

water pumped at one time was 10,000 gallons a minute, or 600,000 an

hour; many other examples might be given, but none so striking as the

above. It may be urged that, by going below the levels reached by the

above works, more water would have been obtained, but that by no means

follows. The Brighton Sewer Works must have intercepted most of the.

land drainage                                                               by going deeper, some water,  stored in cavities below sea-

level, might have been pumped. But the supply depends not on the

quantity stored, but upon the rate at which the fissures can deliver it.

Fissures there are, or, there have been, at all depths ; but, as the circula-

tion is not so rapid in the deeper ones, they are more liable to be choked
414 EEPOKT-- 1882.

by sedimentary and crystalline deposits. Deep mines are often very
dry ones.

     As an example of water-supply obtained from deep down in the chalk,
we may take the supply drawn from the London basin. Below London
we have a great thickness of both the upper and the lower chalk, amounting
together to more than GOO feet in places. As this chalk, so far as we
know, rests in a basin of gault clay, and rises in continuous beds to form
the high ground to the north and south of the London basin, it is in the
best position to be saturated with water, and such was its condition before
it was made use of as a source of water-supply for London and its neigh-
bourhood. As the supply from the shallow -wells made in the tertiary
beds became exhausted, deeper wells were sunk into the chalk beneath,
and water was obtained in plenty. But the supply soon ceased to be equal
to the demand ; the level of the water in the chalk was depressed, so that
wells had to be deepened, and new adits made to cut new fissures. Li
1838 the quantity pumped' in London was estimated at 6,000,000 gallons
a day ; in 1850 the quantity had increased to not more than 12,000,000
gallons a day. In the meantime the level of the water in the chalk had
been depi^essed in some places 50 feet. Thus the larger quantity could
only be obtained at a greater depth, and by increasing the fall in the

fissures delivering the water to the pumps. Now this chalk, from which

only a limited supply could be obtained at a given depth over a large area,

was connected on all sides with an unexhausted i-eservoir, at a much
higher level, formed by the saturated masses of chalk round the London

basin, and yet the water-level in it was reduced by a compai'atively small
amount of pumping.^

      Before leaving the subject of the quantity of water found in carrying

out particular works, 1 will refer to two tunnels now in progress, although
they are not being made in the chalk formation.

     The Mersey Tunnel, which is being made under the direction of Mr.
Brunlees, one of the engineers of the Channel Tunnel Company, will
connect Liverpool and Birkenhead by means of a railway. It is 2j miles
long, of which nearly three-quarters of a mile is beneath the Mersey.

Shafts have been sunk, and a heading has been driven for a quarter of a
mile, and the main tunnel for 600 yards, through the pebble beds of the

New Red Sandstone. Mr. Brunlees tells me that the greatest quantity of

water pumped amounted to 6,000 gallons a minute. This quantity is
being gradually reduced by lining and tubbing.

     The Severn Tunnel is in a more advanced state ; and as it illustrates
many of the points to which I have referred, and as I have been continually
on the works during the last three years, I shall refer to it at greater
length. The Severn Tunnel will be the longest railway tunnel in England,
in all 4i miles in length ; and it is the only railway tunnel which can claim
to be submarine. It passes, for 2^ miles, below a tideway where there is

a rise of tide of 40 feet, and a deptli of water at high water of 90 feet in

the deepest part of the channel. It passes, for a considerable portion of

its length, through the Triassic red marl, which has many points of
resemblance to the chalk. The marl, which is in nearly horizontal beds,

is mnch fissured, and from these fissures, as well as from spaces between
the planes of bedding, mnch water is discharged. At the English end of

the submarine part of the tunnel, for some distance, there is only from.

35 to 40 feet of this open-jointed red marl above the brickwork of the

tunnel, which is already finished where the cover is thinnest. Salt water

flows freely into the work ; and, to show how the water-channels are dis-

connected, salt and fresh water have, in some cases, flowed from adjoining

fissures, and the fresh water has been allowed to flow, for drinking pur-

poses, through pipes built into the brickwork. The largest quantity of

water has been met Avith on the land portion of the tunnel ; and the largest

spring met with was in the land tunnel. It discharged 5,000 gallons a

minnte, and burst suddenly into a heading, which had been driven for

over 1,000 feet, in millstone grit, without meeting with any water. If the

heading had been driven at a level of 10 feet lower, the spring would have

been avoided in the heading, but would have been met with when it was

enlarged to the full size of the tunnel. The total quantity of water now

being pumped is between 7,000 and 8,000 gallons a minute.

     The examples I have given show that engineering works need not be
stopped, even by large quantities of water ; and, mnch as we know of the

chalk and its water-bearing qualities, there is nothing to show that water

would be met with in such large quantities as to stop tunnelling, even in

the upper chalk with flints.

   A tunnel can be made from Fan Hole, in a direct line to the French

coast, wholly in the upper part of the lower chalk without flints, as will

be  seen  from  the  section  of  Line No.  1 of the Plan, PI. V.                                                                                                                   but, as has
                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

been already stated, a tunnel could be made from the same place, if it

were advisable, for nearly three-quarters of the whole distance, in the

lowest beds of grey chalk. To do this, it would be necessary to curve

the line of tunnel southwards, after leaving the shore, and then east-

wards, as shown on the plan in Line No. 2, PI. V. This Avould make the

sea tunnel nearly 1^ miles longer on Line No. 2 than on Line No. 1, PI. V.
That is, the certain immediate cost of making 1^ miles of tunnel with

the prospective disadvantage of 1^ miles more sea tunnel, to work, main-

tain, and ventilate, would be incurred, to save the cost o? possihle excess

of pumping on the one route over the other.

    "Whatever may be urged as the advantage of attempting to follow these

lower beds, there are some very obvious disadvantages and positive dangers

in attempting to do so.

    In the beginning of these discussions respecting the tunnel line, certain

questions were given as necessary for consideration. Of these, the third

--was : On what line will an error in our geological calculations be of least

moment to our tunnelling operations? The map and sections, to which I

have referred, are all based on the result of the French Company's work.

The marine and geological survey was made with care and precautions

such as were probably never before taken, and is an admirable piece of

work. As long as it deals with the surface of the sea-bottom, the reports

and accompanying plans and sections probably tell us a true story, on

which we may rely. But when we pass from the surface of the sea-bed to

Athe strata beneath, we go from facts to conjectures. longitudinal section

(Section E, F, PI. VII.), down the centre of the Channel, shows the chalk

from where it begins, at the outcrop of the gault, dipping at first rapidly

beneath the sea, the dip gradually diminishing as we go eastwards. Now

the part of this section in which error is most likely to be found is in the
curve which denotes the base of the chalk near the outcrop. For the
curve showing the base of the chalk depends not only on the position of

the line on the map which shows the junction of the chalk and ganlt,

which is, probably, in the main, correctly plotted, but also on the line
which shows the junction of the two lowest beds of chalk of the French
geologists (Craie de Rouen and Craie Moyenne). It would be very rash

to take this last line as other than approximate ; yet all it could tell us, if
it were correctly plotted, would be the dip of the base of the chalk close

to the sea-bed, and, even to get that, we should have to assume the thick-
ness of the Craie de Rouen from its ascertained thickness on the two coasts.
Of the dip a short distance below the sea-bed we really know nothing, and
the curve indicating it must be imaginary. If the tannel is to follow the
lower beds of chalk it will have to be near this curve line ; and any varia-

tions in the curve will necessitate deviations in the line of the tunnel, so
that its length might be largely increased. This continual deviation of

line would add much to the difficulties of construction. Again, the lower

the beds in which the tunnel is placed, and the nearer to the outcrop of
those beds, the greater will be the risk of water finding its way along the

planes of bedding from the outcrop.

    As we pass from the outcrop of the base of the chalk and the gault, in

an easterly direction along the Channel, the chalk increases in thickness.

On Line No. 1, the chalk is 480 feet thick, while on Lines Nos. 2 and 3 it

is about half that thickness ; and, with the same thickness of chalk over
the tunnel, there would, on Line No. 1, be 245 feet more chalk below the

tunnel than on Lines Nos. 2 and 3. An error therefore which would

necessitate a considerable deviation in the line of tunnel on Lines Nos.

2 and 3 would not in any way affect No. 1 ; for it would require an error

altering the position of the whole mass of chalk, vertically 245 feet, to
disturb the tunnel line if made in direct line between Fan Hole and
Sangatte, that is on Line No. 1. (See Plates V. and VI.)

     I have given a third section across the Channel, along the line num-
bered 3 on the plan, and the position of a tunnel is shown on it in con-
tinuation of that shown on the section deposited by the South Eastern
Railway Company. This tunnel does not keep wholly in the lowest beds

of chalk, so that it does not fulfil the requii-ements which a tunnel begin-

ning to the westwards of Dover should. That it may do so, one of two

things must be done : the line of the tunnel shown on the plan must be

depressed some 130 feet so that it may follow the lowest beds across the
depression shown on the section, or we must bend the line No. 3 shown

on the plan more to the west, so as to follow the lowest beds of chalk,
where they are found at a higher level nearer to their outcrop. The first
course would render it impossible to make a drainage heading to the shore
in the chalk ; for the tunnel would be so low, at its lowest point, that it

would not be practicable to obtain a fall in the chalk to the shore. This
drainage heading has been already stated to be a necessity. The alternative
remains, but it would make the submarine tunnel at least one mile longer

than Line No. 3, which is already three miles longer than Line No. 1

from Sangatte. That is to say, to avoid passing out of the lowest

beds of chalk, the total length of tunnel would be increased by nearly

fout' miles, besides incurring the other disadvantages of the Folke-

stone route. Four miles of sea tunnel would not cost far short of a
million, an amount which would pay for 4,000 horse-power at work,

--night and day, pumping for nearly seven years a power which would

i-aise more than 40,000,000 gallons each 24 hours.
     In deciding on the best line for the Channel Tunnel, the quantity

of water which may be met with is but one of many factors to be taken
into account. The Folkestone route would sacrifice all those of known

value for the one of which the value is least certain.

    No tunnel will ever be driven under the Channel without meeting with

some water, and an attempt to make one without ample preparations for
dealing with a large quantity of water will only lead to waste of money,

and, perhaps, failure.

     The following is a summary of the advantages to be obtained by
making the tnnnel in a direct line from Fan Hole to Sangatte :

     The shortest sea tunnel.

     As short a land tunnel as by any line.

    A greater thickness of chalk through which to tnnnel.

     The best termination for effecting junctions with the existing English

railways.

    A termination affording facilities for defence at a less cost than else-,

where.

    No certain advantage can be claimed for the Folkestone route, and, as

--compared with the route to the east of Dover, it has the following dis-

advantages :

     The sea tunnel mnst be, at least, three miles longer.
     The land tunnel must be four miles longer, unless the month is placed

in the Folkestone landslip.

   --The chalk on the line of tunnel will be only half the thickness in

round numbers 250 feet against 500 feet.
      It will emerge near no fortifications, nor can it be connected with the

London, Chatham, and Dover Railway Company's line at Dover.
     Further, this tunnel must be made, for a great part of its length, near

the outcrop of the beds through which it is driven.

       Ventilation.

One of the requirements to be fulfilled by the tunnel, which was men-

tioned early in the discussion, was that it should be so designed as to be

capable of being worked by ordinary locomotives.

    A machine may be invented which will be capable of carrying on the

traSic, economically and expeditiously, through a tunnel such as the
Channel Tunnel ; but no machine is known, or has been tried up to the
present time, that is capable of doing the work so economically or so
conveniently as the ordinary locomotive. Until such has been tried and
proved equal to the work, it would not be prudent to spend some millions
of money in making a tunnel which could not be worked by the ordinary

means. It may be taken as an accepted fact that a Channel Tnnnel

worked by an ordinary locomotive would require artificial ventilation.

The matter was discussed, at some length, at a meeting of the Institution
of Civil Engineers, in 1876, when Mr. Morrison read a paper on the
subject. Most extravagant estimates were then made of the number of

1882.  EE
418 REPORT-- 1882.

horse-power required to ventilate the tunnel. The paper itself, and an

account of the discussion which followed, will be found in the Minutes of

the Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers.^

If the attempt be made in a tunnel, 20 miles long, to create, artifici-

ally, a sufiicient velocity in the air to maintain it in a state of even

comparative purity, the difficulties will be found to be very great ; but,

if it be divided into sections, each 5 miles long, and these sections be

treated separately, the difBculties in a great measure disappear.

The distance between the ventilating shafts of Line No. 1 would be

about  21  miles                                 but, to  simplify the  calculations,  assume  a tunnel  20
                                              ;

miles long, with descending gradients of 1 in 80 to points distant 5 miles

from each shore, and rising gradients from thence of 1 in 1,000 for the

5 miles to the centre. (See Plate YII.) The drainage headings, each

with a falling gradient of 1 in 1,000 to the pumping shafts on the shore,

will begin at the lowest points of the tunnel, midway between the centre

and the shores where the two gradients meet.

If the main tunnel be circular, with an internal diameter of 30 feet

and an area of 470 square feet above rail level, air-passages may be formed

below the rails, having an aggregate area of 106 square feet. The drain-

age heading may also be circular, with an internal diameter of 1 7 feet,

and a sectional area of 227 square feet. This will not be much in excess

of what is required during the construction of the tunnel, for the greater

part of the material excavated and materials for construction will be

taken out and in through the drainage heading.

If air be now di'awn out of the drainage heading with a velocity of 10

miles an hour, it will produce a velocity in the tunnel of 2'2.5 miles an

hour, supposing the air exhausted from the tunnel to be replaced at the

shore ends from the shafts and at the centre from the air-passages below

the rails. If 48 trains pass through the tunnel in 24 hours, at intervals

of half an hour, the air will remain pure at the shore ends and in the

centre. Between those points, the quantity of cai-bonic acid, in excess of

that normally contained in air (3| parts per 10,000 of air), will gradually

increase, until it reaches a maximum at the points midway between the

centi'e of the tunnel and each shore, where it will amount to 12'68 parts

per 10,000 in excess, or 16-18 parts altogether. ^ The average condition

throughout the tunnel will be 634 parts in excess, or 9'84 parts in all.

Dr. Angus Smith, in his work on air and rain, states that in his own

study he found 10'4 parts of carbonic acid per 10,000 parts of air. In

theatres, it has been found to vary from 20 to 32 parts ; in the Chancery
Court, between 19 and 20 parts; and the air in a first-olass carriage,

between Gower Street and King's Cross, with the windows open, con-

tained 22-5 parts per 10,000 of air. Thus it will be seen that, if such a

state of things as is described above could be maintained in the tunnel,

there could be no cause of complaint. To do this in a tunnel 20 miles

long would require about 460 effective H.P., or 230 effective H.P.

in each country. In a tunnel in a direct line between Fan Hole and

Sangatte about 500 effective H.P. would suffice. The cost of keeping

     ' Vol. XLIV.

     - In these calculations tlie quantity of carbonic acid produced per train mile has
been arrived at on the assumption that each pound of carbon consumed produces 31

cubic feet of carbonic acid, and that the average consumption of carbon would be

25 lbs. per train mile.

                    The Forth Bridge. By B. Baker,

    [A comniiinication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso
                                            among the Reports.]

At the request of Dr. Siemens the following short paper on the proposed

Forth Bridge has been prepared, though the author himself would have
preferred to postpone any communication on the subject to the British

Association until the works were well in hand, and the many points of

interest and difficulties inseparable from so gigantic an undertaking had

manifested themselves. At the present moment a commencement has

not been made, the whole period, from the revival of the project last year
until now, having been occupied in the necessary preliminary work of ob-
taining the Act of Parliament and preparing the designs and specifications.
It is believed, however, that in a few weeks the contract will be let, and an
energetic start will at once be made with the works.

Before referring in detail to the history of the undertaking and to the

character of the design, the author would like to convey, if possible,

some notion of the magnitude of the proposed bridge across the Firth of

Forth. In preparing the detailed designs he has often experienced no

little difficulty in realising the scale upon which he was working. For

example, the bed-plates for an ordinary railway girder bridge, say a couple

of hundred feet span, would be about half the size of an ordinary dining-

table, and it is difScult at first to picture to oneself a bed-plate abont

double the size of an ordinary dining-?-oo))i ; but that is the size of the

Abed-plates for the Forth Bridge girders.  diagram hanging on the

wall showed the comparative sizes of some of the largest girder and

arched bridges in the world ; but even this failed, in the author's opinion,
to impress upon the mind the vast diflference in scale between the pro-

posed and all previous bridges. On glancing through the last volume of

' Reports of the British Association,' with a view to obtain a notion

as to the ordinary length of papers for Section Gr, he incidentally obtained

a notion also for illustrating, in popular but perfectly accurate terms, the

size of the Forth Bridge as compared with the largest bridges in this

country. In the Report of the Anthropometric Committee it was stated

that the average stature of a new-born infant is 19 3i inches, whilst the

average height of the Guardsmen sent out to Egypt has been officially

given at 5 feet I0| inches. These figures have a ratio of I to 3"65, and,

singularly enough, as the largest railway bridge in this country, the Bri-

tannia Bridge, has a span of 4G5 feet, and the Forth Bridge a span of

1,700 feet, the ratio there also is 1 to 3'65. Hence, to enable anyone to

appreciate the size of the Forth Bridge, we have merely to suggest the

--following simple Rule of Three sum : As a Grenadier Guardsman is to a

new-born infant, so is the Forth Bridge to the largest railway bridge yet

built in this country. Bridges a few feet larger in span than the Bri-

tannia have been built elsewhere, but they are baby bridges after all.

Such being the size of the structure, the question naturally occurs,

why it should be necessary or expedient to build so unpi'ecedented a work

far north in this little island of Great Britain, when it has been found

practicable to cover the globe with railways, and to carrj^ roads across

the greatest Continental rivers, without involving any such difficult

undertaking. The answer is a somewhat complex one. It is not the

physical features of the country, but the habits of the population that ren-

der the construction of a 1,700-feet span expedient. If the British public

can save a few minutes by going a particular roate, by that route will

they go, although the alternative one might be as eligible, or even more

so, in every other respect. This fact was forced upon the attention of

the North British Railway Company nearly twenty years ago, when they

sought powers to construct a bridge across the Forth, to secure for them-

selves and their allies the Great Northern, North Eastern, and Midland

Railways, a fair share of the through ti-affic between England and the

north of Scotland, which they alleged had been hitherto practically mono-

polised by the London and North Western and the Caledonian Railways,

whose route was a few miles shorter. Parliament, satisfied, no doubt,

that the contention was a reasonable one, granted the solicited powers

in the year 1865. The bridge then proposed crossed the Forth at a dif-

ferent spot to the present bridge, as the engineer had not the courage to

face a span of 1,700 feet, and nothing less is practicable at Queensf'erry.

Owing to the treacherous character of the foundations, however, it became

necessary to adopt another site, and by bringing the point of crossing

five miles further down stream to Queensferry, a considei'dble saving in

distance was effected in the roate between Ediubargh and Perth.

The Act for constructing a bridge at Queensferry was obtained in

1873. At this point the Firth of Forth is divided by the island of

Inchgarvie into two unequal channels, but the depth of water in each is

such that a smaller span than 1,700 feet could not be economically adopted

for either channel. North of Inchgarvie the maximum depth of water

is 218 feet, and south of the same 197 feet. In the former channel the

bottom is of hard trap rock, and in the latter partly of rock and partly

of extremely stiff boulder clay. It is not the treacherous character of

the bed of the Forth, therefore, but the depth of water which precludes

the construction of intermediate piers. Pneumatic apparatus is inappli-

cable to such depths as 200 feet, and no responsible engineer would care

to found the piers of an important structure upon a bottom which he had

no means of examining by diviug apparatus or otherwise.

To the late Sir Thomas Bouch is due the ci-edit of the bold proposition

to cross the Forth in two spans of 1,000 feet, and so to avoid the necessity

of intermediate piers iu unprecedented depths of water, with all the

Aconsequent uncertainties and contingencies.  conti-act for the construc-

tion of Sir Thomas Bouch's great suspension bridge was made with

Messrs. Arrol, and the preliminary works were in progress when the Tay

Bridge fell. In consequence of the latter catastrophe the directors of the

Forth Bridge Company decided not to proceed with the works, and an
Abandonment Bill was consequently promoted in the Session of 18il.

The North British, Great Northern, North Eastern, and Midland Railway

Companies, being interested in securing direct comnmnicaiion with the

North of Scotland, objected to the abandonment of the enterprise, and

instructed their respective consulting engineers, Mr. Fowler, Mr.

Harrison, and Mr. Barlow, to, report anew on the practicability and cost

of crossing the Forth, either by a bridge or otherwise, at Queensferry or

Aelsewhere.  careful re-investigation of the whole question was accord-

ingly made, with the i-esult that the directors were advised that iu was

perfectly practicable to build a bridge across the Forth which would comply

with all the requirements of the Board of Trade and public safety, and

that the best place of crossing was at Queensferry. The Abandonment

Bill, which had passed the Commons, was then withdrawn, and the

engineers were instructed to agi-ee upon a design. Modifications of the

original suspension bridge were first considered, and Mr. Fowler and the

author then submitted a project for a bi-idge on the continuous girder
principle. Mr. Harrison and Mr. Barlow, fully appreciating the advan-

tages which would pertain to such a bridge as compared with a more or
less flexible suspension bridge, made independent investigations, and sug-

gested several modifications. Finally, the design now before you was

unanimously agreed upon by all as the one to be recommended to the

directors for adoption. The directors acted upon this recommendation,

and, accordingly, the necessary plans were deposited, and an Act was

obtained this year for constructing a continuous girder bridge across the

Forth at Queensferry, having two spans of 1,700 feet, two of 67 o feet,

fourteen of 168 feet, and six of 50 feet, and giving a clear headway for
navigation purposes of 150 feet above high-water spring tides. For this
work Mr. Fowler and the author are acting as engineers.

It would probably be conceded by everyone that a girder bridge would
422 EEPOBT-- 1882.

prove stiffer than a suspension bridge ; but it is not so obvious tbat it
would also be cheaper. Careful comparative estimates have, however,
proved this to be so in the case of the Forth Bridge, and the reason is
not far to seek. In a long span bridge the weight of the structure itself

constitutes the chief portion of the load, whilst the pressure of the wind
is at least as important an element as the rolling load itself, to carry
which is the sole useful mission of the bridge. In a properly designed
continuous girder for a long span bridge the mass of metal will be
concentrated near the piers, where it will act with the smallest leverage
and produce the least bending moment. In an ordinary suspension bridge,
with stiffening girder vertically to provide for the rolling load, and
horizontally to meet wind stresses, the mass of metal will be somewhat
greater towards the centre of the bridge than at the piers, and conse-
quently for a given mass the moment will be much less in the continuous
girder than in the suspension bridge. Thus the Forth Bridge super-
structure weighs but 2 tons per foot run at the centre of the 1,700 feet
span, and 13-^ tons per foot run at the piers ; whilst in a suspension

bridge, as already stated, the weight of superstructure per lineal foot
would be somewhat greater at the centre than at the piers. This con-

sideration, coupled with the facts that suspension links are more costly

than girder work, that a suspension bridge requires a very costly anchor-
age, and that the contingencies and risks during erection in a stormy
estuary are very great, explains why, in such a case as the Forth Bridge,
well-designed continuous girders form a cheaper, as well as a far stiffer,
structure than a suspension bridge with stiffening girder.

     Continuous girdei's, as a rule, are made of uniform depth, and it
has been considered by some engineers a rather strained application of
the term to so describe the Forth Bridge girders. But clearly it is the
nature of the internal stresses, and not the external appearance of the
girder, which should decide the question ^ and from, this point of view
the proposed Forth Bridge is in the strictest sense of the words a con-

tinuous girder bridge. By all authorities a beam is considered to be

continuous if it is either rigidly or partially fixed as well as supported at

each end in such a manner that a pair of equal and opposite couples act
on the vertical planes at its points of support. In the case of the Forth
 Bridge, such continuity is attained by connecting together the ends of
the two 1,700 feet spans at Inchgarvie, and by projecting the other ends
a distance of 675 feet beyond the main piers, and weighting them to the
required extent. The moment of the couples and the position of the

points of contrary flexure in a continuous girder may be regulated at will,

 either by putting an initial stress on the girder or by severing either the

top or bottom member at the desired point. In the case under con-
sideration, the latter method has been adopted, and the question of the

 most advantageous position for the points of contrary flexure was a sub-

ject of elaborate investigation, as it was known to have a vital influence
 on the economy of the design. Having reference to all the conditions of

 the problem, it proved to be most advantageous to fix the points at a
 distance of 675 feet from the piers, so that in effect the 1,700 feet girder

 may be considered as made up of two cantilevers each 675 feet in length,

 and a central girder 850 feet in span.
      Similarly, on investigation, the most generally advantageous depth

 proved to be about 60 feet at the centre, and 350 feet at the piers ; and,
 this being settled, the next thing to be determined was the most advan-
                     THE FORTH BRIDGE.  и                423

tageous width for the superstructure. Since the fall of the Tay Bridge,
engineers generally, and the Board of Trade in particular, have vividly
realised the fact that the severest wrench to which a railway viaduct is
subject arises not from the vertical stress due to the loading of both lines
of rails with locomotives throughout, but to the diagonal stress due to
the combined action of the ordinary rolling load and a violent hurricane.
In the case of the Forth Bridge this stress would act at an angle of about
45░, so that, were it not for the dead weight of the structure, the
required strength would be the same horizontally as vertically, and the
economical width would be the same as the economical depth. Although
the dead weight modifies this conclusion, it was obvious that the bridge
should be a continuous girder of varying depth on plan as well as on
elevation, and investigation showed the economical width of superstruc-
ture to be about 32 feet at the centre, and 132 feet at the piers.

      It was open to consideration whether the wind stresses should be
resisted by bracing together both the top and bottom members of the
girder, or the bottom members alone. The author, however, never had
any doubt that, as the stresses must sooner or later be brought down to
the masonry piers, they had better be brought down at once by the
shortest route along the bottom members only. The top members are

therefore spaced at the distance of from 33 feet to 27 feet apart, centre to
centre, and are unconnected by wind-bracing. Each of the main vertical
and diagonal struts consists of a pair of tubes spread out at the base like
a bridge pier, and the wind stresses on the bracing between the tubes

are much reduced thereby. In like manner are the wind stresses on
the bracing of the bottom member reduced by the spreading out of the
legs of the cantilevers, and the general stresses on the web members

by the tapering depth from the piers towards the ends of the canti-

levers.

     Having thus blocked out the general outline of the girder so that the
shearing stresses from the diagonal action of the wind and load should
be largely taken up direct by the, main members, the next point was to
determine the number of bays, and the angle of the web bracing. It was
not infrequently assumed that 45░ was the most economical angle, but
this was true only when the admissible stress was the same in compres-
sion as in tension, which was not the case either with wrought iron or
steel, or where, as in the instance of wind-bracing, the diagonals were
subject to alternate compressive and tensile stresses. American bridge
builders, as a rule, disposed their long slender struts vertically, and their
diagonal ties at an angle of 45░, and as the question of competition
entered into the problem, it might safely be assumed that economical
considerations dictated this arrangement. The general slope of the web
membei's of the Forth Bridge was something between the angle of 45░
and the vertical, and, although the author was not prepared to contend
that the disposition adopted was the most economical attainable, yet he

was satisfied that it reasonably approached that limit.

Whatever the angle of the bracing, it was quite clear that, in a girder

of 1,700 feet span, exceptionally long struts would have to be provided,

I and it was a matter of much importance, therefore, that the struts and
      compression members generally should be of the most economical and
efficient form. The advantages offered by a circular form of cross-section

handle plans and drawings well knew. Similarly, a thin sheet of iron or

steel, bent into a tubular form, without further stifiening, offered as high

a resistance per square inch to compression as the most heavily braced

rectangular strut. The author recently tested a piece of ordinary stove-

pipe, 4 inches in diameter and 2 feet long, made of sheet iron only about

a fortieth of an inch in thickness, and found it stood, without buckling, a

compressive stress of ]5"9 tons per square inch, whereas one of the Britannia

Bridge rectangular cells, 18 inches square and 8 feet long, made of plates

and angles half an inch thick, crippled under a stress of 136 tons, or say

15 per cent, less stress than that sustained by the piece of stove-pipe. If

flat plates, as much as half an inch in thickness, behaved so badly in a

rectangular cell only 18 inches square, it is hardly necessary to speculate

as to what would be the case in tubes 12 feet square, which would be the
size required for the Forth girders. With rectangular struts formed of

four corner-pieces and lattice sides, the required strength of the lattice-

work has been found by experiment to be considerably greater than theory

would indicate, and the form, therefore, is a very disadvantageous one as

compared with a circular cross-section where eveiy particle of metal per-

forms useful work. In a long span bridge, it is essential to reduce the

secondary bracing to a minimum, because the weight of metal itself con-

stitutes the chief load. For that and for many other reasons, including

the comparatively small resistance offered by a curved surface to the wind,

the author, after carrying out not a few experiments himself, and passing

in review the numerous experiments made by others during the past thirty

years, was satisfied that a circular form of cross- section was the proper

one in the case of the Forth Bridge. All the main compression members,

therefore, will be tubes varying in diameter fi'om b feet to 12 feet, and only

the wind bracing, subject to alternate compressive and tensile stresses,

will consist of rectangular latticed members.

Between the two main girders, as described above, the doiible line of

railway will be carried on an internal viaduct, supported by trestles and

cross- girders. The permanent way will consist of heavy bridge rail.Ф?

on longitudinal sleepers bedded in four steel troughs, the outer pair of

which serve also as the top members of the girders of the internal viaduct,

the inner pair being simply rail-bearers. The width of trough is such

that, in the event of derailment, the wheels will drop into the troughs,

Aand run along the timber sleepers clear of obstruction.  buckle plate

floor and parapet or wind screen will be provided of ample strength to

ensure the safety of the trains. No guard rails will be introduced, as the

engineers and the Board of Trade are in accord in considering them a

source of danger during high winds.

It is hardly necessary to state that the whole of the superstructure will

be of steel. For the tension members the steel used is to have an ultimate

tensile strength of not less than 30 tons nor more than 33 tons per square

inch, with an elongation of 20 per cent, in a length of 8 inches. For the

compression members the strength is to be from 34 to 37 tons, and the

elongation 17 per cent. In making the tubes and other members, all plates

and bars which can be bent cold are to be so treated, and, where heating

is essential, no work is to be done upon the material after it has fallen to

a blue heat. The steady pressure of hydraulic presses is to be substituted

for hammering wherever practicable, and annealing will be required if the

drilled through the whole thickness of plates and angles after being put

together.

    Previous to the preparation of the designs and estimates, many con-

sultations were held with the Board of Trade officers with reference to

the maximum wind-pressure to be provided against, and the admissible

stress upon the metal. Existing rules limit the stress to 6^ tons per
square inch, and it was desired to get this limit extended to 7 J tons. This
was assented to by the Board, as the 6h tons working stress was based

upon the assumption of the steel having a minimum ultimate tensile

strength of 2G tons per square inch, whereas the Forth Bridge steel was to
have a strength of at least 30 tons. As regards wind-pressure, the present
Board of Trade provision of 56 lbs. per square foot has been adhered to,
and that pressure has been assumed to take effect upon a surface equiva-

lent to double the plane surface of the bridge, a deduction of 50 per cent,

being made in the instance of the cylindrical surfaces. Under the com-
bined action of the wind- pressure, estimated as above, and a rolling load
of two tons per foot run, or 3,400 tons on each span, the maximum stress
Avonld in no case exceed 7h tons per square inch, whilst upon the members
of the wind-bracing, subject to alternate compressive and tensile stresses,
it would not be greater than 5 tons per square inch. In ordinary work-

--ing that is to say, with heavy coal trains and light winds--the maximum

stresses would be about 6 tons in tension and 5 tons in compression,
which were about the same as the Saltash Bridge of 460-feet span would
be subject to under the same circumstances, and that bridge is of iron.
Even assuming that such a hurricane as 56 lbs. per square foot could ever

take effect over so large a surface as that offered by the 1,700-feet girders,
it was quite clear that no train could be on the bridge at the time, for a
pressure of 30 to 40 lbs. would certainly stop the progress of any train.

Without the rolling load the maximum stresses during the hurricane

would, however, be only about 4J tons in tension and 6 tons in compres-
sion. Indeed, if the Forth Bridge were made of iron insl^ead of steel, it

would be a relatively stronger structure than either the Britannia or Salt-
ash Bridge, so that the 50 per cent, extra strength dae to the adoption of

the steel may be regarded as an addition to the factor of safety, and not

as a necessity of the unprecedented length of span.
      Continental and American engineers at the present time almost univer-

sally take note of the vast differentie in the destructive effect of a live

load and a dead load ; but the Board of Trade entirely ignore this fact,
and adopt the Fame limiting stress in a main girder, where the greater

portion of the load may be dead, as in a cross girder, where it is prac-

tically all live, and where vibration is set up by every passing wdieel. It

--is generally admitted and the practice and experience of mechanical
--eno-ineers confirm the conclusion that metal of any class may be sub-

ject to a working stress twice as great under a dead as under a purely

live load. Some engineers make a compromise and take the ratio at

one and a half times. If this be done, and a factor of safety of three
be adopted in the instance of a purely dead load, the admissible working
stresses for iron having an ultimate strength of 20 tons per square inch

would be 6| tons for a dead load, 5^ tons for half dead and half live,
5 tons for quarter dead and three-quarters live (which is about the

proportion obtaining in railway girders of 100 feet span), 4^ tons for

all live load, and 2^ tons for members subject to alternate tension
and compression of equal intensity. With steel having a strength of
--426 REPORT 1882.

30 tons, the corresponding stresses would be 50 per cent, greater

that is to say, they -wonld range from 6f tons for an all live
load to 10 tons for an all dead load. If the stresses be limited as

above, the results of experiment and of actual practice show that a struc-

ture may be subject to an indefinite number of repetitions of the stress

without injury. But, in the case of hurricanes, the repetitions will

necessarily be few and far between, and higher stresses are therefore

admissible in the members of wind-bracing than in the piston-rod of a

steam engine, though both are subject to alternate tensile and compres-

sive stresses. When it is remembered that the dead weight between the

piers of the 1,700-feet span is upwards of 10,000 tons, whilst the live

load due to a couple of heavy coal trains would be less than one-tenth of

that amount, the relative lowness of the 7^ tons per square inch maximum

stress in the Forth Bridge girders, under the combined action of an im-

possible load and an improbable hurricane, will be conceded by all.

   --So far as the author is aware although it has been established

beyond all dispute that repeated application of a tensile stress amounting

to two-thirds of the ultimate strength of the material would in time

--cause fracture it has never been proved that the same conclusion applies

to metal in compression. In fact, some of the author's experiments lead

him to think that a contrary result might obtain. For example, one of

the consequences of heavy varying stresses and vibrations is that the

quality of the metal deteriorates, both iron and steel becoming more

crystalline and less ductile. These conditions are rather favourable than

otherwise to the resistance of a compression member. Thus the author

tested some columns, 30 diameters in leugth, of high-class ductile steel,

and of inferior crystalline steel, both having, however, the same tensile

strength. The inferior steel bore 40 per cent, more load than the high-

class steel, and it appears not improbable that, if the quality of the

latter had been deteriorated by vibration and heavy stresses the ultimate

resistance would have been increased as regards compressive stresses

almost as much as it would be diminished in respect of tensile stresses.

Similarly, in columns of the same proportion, the commonest class of pig

iron would beat the finest brands of wrought iron.

    Long struts were avoided at any expense by some engineers, but, the

author thought, without good reason. The tubular struts in the Forth

Bridge, if made of iron, would resist as high a compressive stress per

square inch as the top flange of any existing girder, and the same remark

would apply to steel. An interesting series of experiments was recently

made in America with full- sized wrought iron hollow columns, from

8 inches to 12 inches in diameter, and up to 28 feet in length. The influ-

ence of the length of the column on its resistance was singularly small.

For instance, the 8-inch column, when 15 diameters in length, failed with
a stress of 16'2 tons per square inch ; and when as much as 42 diameters

in length, with 15"6 tons. Now the model of the Britannia Bridge,

75  feet  in  span,  failed  with  14'8  tons  per  square inch compression
                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

Brunei's 66-feet girder, having a 3-feet wide cellular top member, failed

with 126 tons and some girders tested by the author with 15 tous per
                                                                              ;

square inch as an average on the top flange.

    Taking the mean results of a large number of expei'iments, the influ-

ence of length between the practical limits of 15 to 25 diameters would

be just appreciable but, if only a few experiments were compared, the
                                                                                                         ;

deduction might be drawn that lengthening a column, or rounding its
THE FORTH BRIDGE.  427

ends, increased rather than reduced its strength. Thus one steel tube,
20 diameters in length, tested by the author, bore 22 tons per square

inch, whilst a similar tube of half the length bore only 19-2 tons.

Again, a round-ended column, 20 diameters in length, bore lOS tons per
square inch, whilst a flat-ended one failed with 18 tons. No doubt

greater regularity would obtain with full-sized than with model tubes,
but still the pi-actical fact remained that, within the limits occurring in
the Forth Bridge, the compressive resistance of the tubular struts would
be as high as that of the top flange of any plate or box girder that could
be built, and that whatever stress was admissible in the girder would be
admissible in the struts. This was a reassuring result to arrive at, be-
cause the practical experience had been chiefly with girders, and not with

tubular struts.

      The author's experiments conclusively prove that steel is far superior
to iron as a material for struts, though the superiority is not so great as
when tension members are in question. Thus the Forth Bridge struts
will be from 30 to 40 per cent, stronger in steel than in iron, whilst the
tension members will be about 50 per cent, stronger. It does not follow
that the steel strut would not be 50 per cent, better also as regards actual
 work, which is very different to what takes place in a testing machine.

A steel or an iron rail, tested for transverse strength in a machine, will,

as a rule, bend many inches, and fail by distortion of the head under the
 compressive stress. In actual work hundreds of such rails break, but it

 is the tensile and not the compressive stress which causes the failure, and

 there is no distortion of the head as in the testing machine. Similarly,

 when riveted girders break under traffic, it is not the top flanges with

 a calculated stress on the average of about one-third of the ultimate re-
 sistance that give way, but the bottom members, where the calculated

 stress is only about one-fourth of the ultimate resistance. In short, the

 universal experience is that fatigue is far more injurious to iron or steel

 under tensile than under compressive stress, and it follows that the factor
 of safety should not be the same in the two cases. This is quite con-

 sistent with ordinary practice, for probably the majority of girder bridges

 in this country have equal-sized top and bottom flanges, which, after
 allowing for the riveting, would give a factor of about three for the com-

 pression and about four for the tension members respectively.
      The peculiarities of steel are tolerably well undei-stood now, and

 amongst other precautions it is especially desirable to so design the joints
 in tension that no tearing action shall be set up along a line of rivet-
 holes. Accidents of workmanship necessitate the provision of a good

 factor of safety in steel joints in tension ; but, after watching the testing

 of many steel tubes under compression, the author cannot conceive any

 accident of workmanship which could bring about the failui'e of steel
 tubes such as those in the Forth Bridge, even if the working stress was

 raised to two-thirds, instead of about one-fourth, of the ultimate resist-

 ance. ' In fine, he believes a steel tube to be the most trustworthy mem-

 ber which could be introduced into a great and unprecedented work.

      As regards cost of manufacture, the difi'erence is comparatively
 small between a circular and a rectangular member. The main tubes

 will be made up circumfei-entially of ten bent plates, lap-jointed and
 double-riveted through the flanges of ten rolled beams, which will run

 longitudinally through the whole length of the tube. Stiffening rings

 will also be introduced at suitable intervals. The junctions of the tubular
428 REPORT-- 1882.

struts with tlie tabular bottom members offered some little diflBculty at

first in designing, but this being surmounted, the manufacture of the
junction lengths becomes, as it were, a piece of ship-builder's work, except
that the ship-builder has to deal with far more complex curvatures than
will be found in the junction lengths.

      Before dismissing the question of steel in compression, the author

would wish to mention the results of some experiments made by him on
steel which had been previously subjected to end pressure in a tube, so
that flexure could not occur. The rods were 1 inch diameter by 30 inches
long. With the mildest steel, the resistance to flexure was 14"'5 tons per
square inch in the uncompressed rods, and 22 tons, or say 50 per cent,
more, in the rods which had previously been subjected to an end pressure
of 36 tons per square inch. With somewhat harder steel, the corre-
sponding figures were 16 tons in the uncompressed, and from 26 to 29

--tons in the previously compressed bars a gain of from 60 to 80 per cent.

The bars, when tested in tension, showed no loss in strength or elonga-
tion from the previous compression. As 30.ton steel, after the end pres-
sure had been applied, bore as much load without flexure as 54-ton steel
which had not been so treated, it is clear that the adoption of mild steel
in railway bridges would be much accelerated if some simple practical
method could be devised for bringing about the molecular change effected
in the above instances by an end pressure.

    It has been stated that the maximum wind-pressure upon the 1,700-

feet span has been assumed to be equivalent to a pressure of 56 lbs. per
square foot upon double the supci'ficial area of the girder. It is to be

regretted that this assumption necessarily involves many matters of piire

conjecture. For example, though a wind-pressure of 56 lbs. has un-
doubtedly been registered by anemometers exposing a surface of a couple
of square feet, it has never been proved to prevail instantaneously over
so gi'eat a width as the 1,700-feet span. Again, the relative resistances
offered by the windward and leeward girders of a bridge have not been
measured, and still less has any experimental approximation been ob-
tained to the resistance of an entire bridge with its floor and cross-

bracing. Probably much may be done by models, and the author intends

to so ascertain, if possible, the probable resistance of the Forth Bridge
expressed in square feet of flat surface. Exjjeriments with relation to

--wind-pressure have been commenced at the site of the bridge a pressure

board, 20 feet long and 15 feet wide, having been fixed on the top of a
tower on the island of Inchgarvie, where the central pier of the bridge
will be placed. The apparatus is adapted to test the relative resistances
offered by different surfaces, and during the progress of the works it is

hoped many now open questions may be settled. The experiments will
probably not affect in any way the design of the bridge, because the lead-

ing features of the design and the working stresses and wind-pressure
to be provided for have long since been settled with the Board of Trade.
Until the experiments are complete, however, it will be impossible to
state with precision what factor of safety will belong to the woi-k, though
it is possible to state, without reservation of any kind, that in any event
the Forth Bridge, as designed, will be relatively stronger than any other
bridge yet constructed. Owing to the large dead weight and the spread
of the girders at the piers, a wind-pressure equivalent to 2 cwt. per
square foot upon the surface of one girder would be required to overturn
the bridge, assuming it not to be held down by bolts. The holding-down
THE FORTH BRIDGE.  429

bolts provided, however, about double the resistance to overturning, so
that 4 cwt. of wind-pressure per square foot upon the single surface would
be required to upset the bridge ; and under this ideal pressure, though
the wind-bracing would, it is true, be on the point of failing, none of the

great tubes or tension members of the main girders would even be per-

manently deformed.
     Chancres of temperature as well as gales of wind will affect the stresses

upon the steel but to a comparatively insignificant extent. In designing
a certain class of work, nothing embari-asses an engineer more than ques-

tions arising out of the expansion and contraction of materials. An expe-
rienced engineer will know that in certain instances he maj' entirely

io-nore the influence of temperature, whilst in others it is all-important.

For example, if a provision were not made in the case of point rods, the

points would fail to close, and great loss of life might follow the conse-
quent derailment of a train, whilst, on the other hand, infinite complica-
tion would result if a similar provision had to be made in a structure like

the Crystal Palace, or in long station roofs, or in girders carrying build-

ino-s. Only experience could decide whether it would be safe to carry

an ornamental ashlar-faced building on a girder 150 feet in length with-
out running the risk of inducing cracks in the masoni'y ; but the author,
havino- tried it, can say that the effects of temperature in such a case

may be safely ignored. Similarly he had used, without inconvenience,

 girders G30 feet in length in the floor of a building, and purlines of equal
lencrth in the roof of a station. Each case must, however, be dealt with

on its own merits ; for in another instance, where a gasworks roof had
fallen down like a pack of cards, he had traced the cause of the accident

 unmistakably to the expansion of the iron slate-battens, which were ex-

 posed to exceptionally high temperatures at times. An engineer is apt

 to consider he has taken sufficient account of expansion if he adopts the
 conventional course of placing one end of his girders on rollers or sliding

plates, so that the bridge may be free to expand in the direction of its
lencrth. The superstructure, it is true, may be twice as wide as it is

 lontr, but it must take its chance as regards expansion in the direction of

 thewidth. Arched station-roofs, such as the St. Pancras roof of 240-feet

 span and 700 feet length, seem to require no provision for expansion in
 either direction. Again, the Victoria Bridge at Pimlico has longitu-

 dinal girders 913 feet in length, and cross girders 100 feet in length,

 with no provision for expansion in either direction. On the other hand,

 at the Southwark Bridge, grooves had to be cut in the masonry to
 admit of the free expansion of the cast-iron spandrils, which had
 been fractured by expansion in several instances, though the arch was
 only 240 feet in span, and the spandrils were not continuous across

the piers. However much the engineer may desire to eliminate stresses

 due to expansion, he will find it impossible to do so, for the very ob-
 vious reason that the temperature is not uniform at any instant, and

 that even in this climate there may be a difference of 50 degrees between
the tempei'ature in the sun and in the shade. Take the case of an ordi-
 nary lattice girder with trough-shaped top and bottom members and
double lattices. One side plate of the trough may be highly heated by

 the direct rays of the sun, and the other be completely in the cool shade,

and one tie bar may similarly differ from its companion bar in tempera-

 ture. If the girder were free to warp in any direction like a thin plank,

 little stress would result ; but as it is not free to adapt itself to the un-
--430
KEPORT 1882.

equal heating, stresses of considerable severity must occur, since 12░

increase of temperature is the equivalent as regards elongation of 1 ton

per square inch stress. On a hot sunny day the Britannia tube Avas found

to warp 3 inches laterally and 2^ inches vertically \rhen free to move ; and,

clearly, if such tendency be restrained, uniformity of stress is unattainable.

The Forth Bridge tubular struts would similarly tend to curve under the

action of the sun's rays, but, being braced together, they will not be free

to do so, and stress must result. Every structure, in fact, is subject to such

stresses, which are one of the things covered by the usual factor of safety.

Stone buildings and arches are no exception to the rule ; indeed, the

author, from instances which have come under his own knowledge, is

satisfied that the stresses due to changes of temperature are often rela-

tively far more severe in stone than in iron arches.

Since by no practical means could stresses from expansion and con-

traction be wholly eliminated from the Forth Bridge, it became a matter

for careful consideration what provision for expansion would be requisite

or expedient, and what could be dispensed with. There could be no doubt,

of course, that longitudinal expansion in the 1,700-feet span should be

provided for by placing one end of the 850-feet girder on rollers where

it was supported by the cantilever. The direct stresses would thus be

eliminated, but there remained those due to the unequal heating of the

different members, as in every other bridge. These stresses were not

included in the estimated maximum tension and compression per square

inch given in a previous part of this paper, but were assumed, as usual,

Ato be covered by the factor of safety.  more difficult question arose with

reference to the portions of the girders between the piers. Thus the

Inchgarvie pier consists of four cylindrical masses of masonry, spaced 270

feet apart longitudinally, and 120 feet apart transversely, centre to centre.

The point to be decided was whether the great girdei's should be bolted

to each mass of masonry, or be fixed at one end only of the above 270

feet, and be placed on rollers at the other end. This would be done, as a

matter of course, with an ordinary 270-feet span girder bridge, but the

conditions here were very different. In the first place, the pressure was

enormous, and a bed-plate 35 feet by 18 feet was not a convenient oue to

provide with rollers. The most important point, however, was that sudden

and unequally distributed gusts of wind caused stresses, Vhich rendered it

extremely desirable to dispense with rollers if possible. On considering

the question in detail, it proved to be quite possible to do so. The range

of temperature in this climate is not really great on well-protected

surfaces, as the practical uniformity of temperature a few inches below

the ground testifies. Taking the average of twenty years' observations at

Greenwich, the mean shade temperature of the different months ranged

from 38*94░ in January to 62-54░ in July. As the average for the whole

twenty years was 49"69░, the range was thus merely 11░ below and 13░

above the mean temperature. Since 12░ corresponds to a ton per square

inch stress, ironwork bedded at a mean temperature in a mass of masonry

might well be subject to no greater stress from variation of temperature

than plus and minus 1 ton per square inch, which is far less than would

obtain in a so- styled free-to-expand structure exposed to the rays of the sun.

Last year was characterised by great extremes of temperature. In

January the temperature fell to 12'7░, whilst in July it rose to 97"1░, a

range of no less than 84"4░ in the shade. The lowest mean daily tem-

--perature was 19'4░ in January, and the highest 78'6░ in July a range of
                        THE FORTH BRIDGE.                             431

59'2░. The maximum daily range was 37░, and monthly range 53░, both

in July. In the sun the temperature rose as high as 150░, so the extreme
range for the year would be no less than 137░. The average yearly range

being less than 24░, a clear explanation is thus afforded of the fact so well

pi'oved by experience, that provision for expansion is essential in point

rods, signal wires, and similar exposed and light pieces of ironwork, whilst

it may safely be ignored in the case of girders enclosed in buildings or

bedded in jack-arches.

Having reference to the considerations thus briefly set forth, and to

the behaviour of existing structures of all classes in this climate, it proved,

on investigation, to be quite tinnecessary, as far as temperature was con-

cerned, to provide rollers at Inchgarvie pier. The steel tubes between

the four cylindrical masses of masonry will be covered, like marine

boilers, with a couple of inches of ' fossil meal ' or some other suitable

non-conducting material, and an exterior iron envelope. Inside the tubes

will be lined with about 2 feet in thickness of cement concrete, to serve

as an equaliser of temperature, and, these precautions being taken, the

results of calculation show that the stresses from changes of temperature

will be of no moment either to the superstructure or to the masonry.

There still remained the question whether, for other reasons than

temperature, rollers might not be necessary at Inchgarvie. Since the

270-feet-loug tubes would be erected upon scaffolding, there would be no

stress upon the metal at first, but as the erection of the cantilevers by

overhanging proceeded, there would be the gradually increasing thrust

from the bottom member, and it ajDpeared ditScult to say whether this

thrust would come upon the tubes or upon the piers as abutments, unless

Arollers were introduced.  compressive stress of 5 tons per square inch

would shorten the tube 1^ inches, and as the stout masonry piers would
tilt very little, this movement could not occur, and the tubes would not

take up their share of the work unless some sliding were provided for.

After a careful consideration of all the conditions of the problem, including

changes of temperature, the author came to the conclusion that a certain

amount of initial stress on the tubes between the masonry piers was

desirable ; and although it might at first appear to be difficult to do this
with a tube 12 feet in diameter by 2 inches in thickness, the difficulty

Tanished, as usual, upon being grappled with. He proposed simply to
make the upper and lower bed-plates, which were intended to slide on

each other during the erection of the bridge, with serrated surfaces

sloping at an angle of 1 in 6. As the coefficient of the well-greased and

l^laned steel surfaces would not exceed one-twentieth of the load, the

shortening of the tube under the compressive stress due to the erection
of the cantilevers would proceed freely, Avhilst the desired initial stress
would be put on partly by the weight of the structure and the tightening

of the holding-down bolts taking effect on the 1 in G incline, and partly

Aby the test load of the bridge.     movement of li inches would be pro-

vided for temporarily, and the two bed-plates would finally be gripped

together and made fast to the piers by 40 holding-down bolts of 3 inches

diameter. When complete, the stresses on the metal would never exceed

the limit of 7h tons under the joint influence of live load, wind, and tem-
perature, and the pressure upon the masonry piers and foundations would

be well within the woi'king limits.

     It is unnecessary to refer in detail to the mode of erection, as it is obvious
that the work will be commenced at each pier, and be i^roceeded with by
--432 EEPORT 1882.

 adding successive portions to the ends of the cantilevers until the same
 are complete. The central girders will also probably be erected on the
 overhanging system, temporary connections being formed between the ends
 of the cantilevers and the central girders. The closing lengths or key-pieces
 at the centre of each 1,700-feet span will be put in on a cloudy day, when
 there is little variation in temperature, and the details will be so arranged
 that the key-piece can be completed and the temporary connections cut
 away in a few hours, so as to avoid any temporary inconvenience from
 expansion and contraction.

     No special difficulty will arise with respect to the foundations, though

the works will be, of course, on an unusually large scale. The island of
Inchgarvie is of trap rock, and the central pier at that spot will consist
of four cylindrical masses of concrete and rubble- work faced with granite,
and having a diameter of 45 feet at the top and 70 feet at the bottom.
 The height above high water will be 18 feet, and the depth below the
 same will vary from 24 feet to 70 feet. After the sloping face of the rock
foundation has been cut into steps, wrought-iron caissons will be floated
out, lowered into place, and filled with concrete lowered through the water
iu hopper-bottomed skips. Queensferry Pier will be founded on boulder
clay. Open-topped cylindrical caissons, 70 feet diameter, with an external
and internal skin 7 ft. G in. apart, will be floated out and lowered into
jolace. The space between the skins will be filled with concrete, to give
strength and weight to overcome frictional resistance in sinking. Grab
excavators will be carried on a turntable top to the caissons to remove the
earth from the interior, and pneumatic apparatus will be supplied to
enable men to clear boulders from the cutting edge of the caissons. From
a depth of 6 feet below low water upwards, the masoniy will be built in
the dry, inside a movable caisson connected by an indiarubber joint with
the permanent caisson below it. The piers will be carried down at least
10 feet into the boulder clay, which will give depths ranging from 68 feet
to 88 feet below high water and 18 feet less at low water in the respective
cylinders. In round numbers the weight of one of the cylindrical piers
at Queensferry may be taken at 16,000 tons, and the combined vertical
pressure on the top of the pier from the dead weight of superstructure,
rolling load, and wind pressure at 8,000 tons ; so the load on the clay
would average about 6 tons per square foot over the area of the founda-
tion. This is an insignificant amount on such bard clay as that at the
Forth, and the margin is ample, therefore, to allow of the unequal distri-
bution of the pressure due to the action of partial blasts of wind and of a
certain amount of expansion in the tubes connecting the piers.

     The total length of the great continuous girder is 5,330 feet, or say a
mile, and of the viaduct approaches 2,754 feet, or rather over half a mile.
There is nothing calling for special remark in the viaduct. The piers
will be of rubble masoniy, faced with granite, and the superstructure of
iron lattice girders with buckled plate floor and trough rail bearers, as in
the instance of the main spans. The main girders, spaced 16 feet apart,
will be placed under the railway, and there will be a strong parapet and
wind screen to pi-otect the trains.

     To engineers little need be said respecting the stiffness of a girder
bridge having the proportions adopted in the present case. The central
girder has a depth of one-seventh of the span, whilst the cantilevers may

is the additional fact that the live load of a passing train will be quite

insigniflcant as compared with the dead load of the structure. The

heaviest train traversing the bridge will not deflect the 1,700-feet girder

more than 4 inches, which is considerably less th&n the deflection of the
460-feet span of Saltash Bridge under its test load, whilst a wind pressm-e,
equivalent to 30 lbs. per square foot over the entire 1,700 feet, would bend

the bridge laterally less than 9 inches.
     About 42,000 tons of steel will be used in the superstructure of the

main spans, and 3,000 tons of wrought iron in that of the viaduct ap-
proach. The total quantity of masonry in the piers and foundations will
be about 125,000 cubic yards, and the estimated cost of the entire work,
upon the basis of the prices at which the original suspension bridge was
contracted for is about 1,500,000Z. Owing to the varying price of steel,
and to the magnitude and novelty of the undertaking, this estimate must
be taken as approximate only, as a contract has not yet been concluded

for the works.

     It will be gathered from the preceding necessarily brief and incomplete
description of the proposed Forth Bridge that no novel or untried elements

enter into the design. In principle, a continuous girder is as old a type
of construction as an arch or a suspension bridge ; and probably, in pre-
historic times, streams were crossed by the aid of a couple of overhanging

branches and an intermediate central portion, constituting a structure
rude in appearance but identical in principle with the girder bridge.
The merit of the design, if any, will be found, not in the novelty of the

principles underlying it, but in the resolute application of well-tested

mechanical laws and experimental results to the somewhat diflicult pro-
blem offered by the construction of so large a bridge across so exposed an
estuary as the Firth of Forth

             The President delivered the following Address :

      In common with some of my predecessors in this chair, I recognise that probably

       the most useful form which a presidential address coidd take, would be a summary
        of the progress of physics, or of some important branch of physics, during recent years.
        But the difficulties of such a task are considerable, and 1 do not feel myself equal
        to grappling with them. The few remarks which I have to offer are of a general,
       I fear it may be thought of a commonplace, character. All I can hope is that they
       may have the effect of leading us into a frame of mind suitable for the work that

          lies before us.

             The diversity of the subjects which come under our notice in thic section, as
        well as of the methods by which alone they can be adequately dealt with, although
         a sign of the importance of our work, is a source of considerable difficulty in the
       conduct of it. From the almost inevitable specialisation of modern science, it has
        come about that much that is familiar to one member of cur Section is unintelligible
        to another, and that details whose importance is obvious to the one fail altogether
        to rouse any interest in the mind of the other. I must appeal to the authors of
         papers to bear this difficult}' in mind, and to confine within moderate limits their

          discussion of points of less general interest.

             Even within the limits of those departments whose foundation is evidently
         experimental, tliere is room, and indeed necessity, for great variety of treat-
        ment. One class of investigators relies mainly upon reiterated appeals to experi-
        ment to resolve the questions which appear still to be open ; while another prefers,
        with Thomas Young, to base its decisions as far as possible upon deductions from
        experiments already made by others. It is scarcely necessary to say that in the

       present state of science both methods are indispensable. Even where we may fairly

         suppose that the fundamental principles are well-established, careful and often
        troublesome work is necessary to determine with accuracy the constants which

       enter into the expression of natural laws. In many cases the accuracy desirable,
       even from a practical point of view, is hard to attain. In many others, where the
       interest is mainly theoretical, we cannot afford to neglect the confirmations which
       our views may derive from the comparison of measurements made in different fields

        and in face of different experimental difficulties. Examples of the inter-depen-

       dence of measurements apparently distinct will occur to every physicist. I may

         mention the absolute detei'minations of electrical resistance, and of the amounts of
        heat developed from electrical and mechanical work, any two of which involve also
         the third, and the relation of the velocity of sound to the mechanical and thermal

          properties of air.

            Where a measurement is isolated, and not likely to lead to the solution of any

        open question, it is doubtless possible to spend upon it time and attention that

       might with advantage be otherwise bestowed. In such a case we may properly be

 satisfied for a time with work of a less severe and accurate character, knowing that
with the progress of knowledge the way is sure to be smoothed both by a better
 appreciation of the difficulties involved, and by the invention of improved experi-
 mental appliances. I hope I shall not be misunderstood as underrating the

 importance of great accuracy in its proper place if I express the opinion that the
desire for it has sometimes had a prejudicial effect. In cases where a rough result
 would have sufficed for all immediate purposes, no measurement at all has been
 attempted, because the circumstances rendered it unlikely that a high standard of
 precision could be attained. AVhether our aim be more or less ambitious, it is
important to recognise the limitations to which our methods are necessarily subject,
 and as far as possible to estimate the extent to which our results are uncertain.

The comparison of estimates of uncertainty made before and after the execution of
a set of measurements may sometimes be humiliating, but it is always instructive.

     Even when our results show no greater discrepancies than we were originally

 prepared for, it is well to err on the side of modesty in estimating their trustworthi-
ness. The history of science teaches only too plainh' the lesson that no single method
 is absolutely to be relied upon, that sources of error lurk where they are least ex-

pected, and that they may escape the notice of the most experienced and conscien-

tious worker. It is only by the concurrence of evidence of various kinds and from

various sources that practical certainty may at last be attained, and complete con-

fidence justified. Perhaps I may be allowed to illustrate my meaning by reference
to a subject which has engaged a good deal of my attention for the last two years

the absolute measurement of electrical resistance. The unit commonl}' employed in
this country is fomided npon experiments made about twenty years ago by a dis-
tinguished committee of this Association, and was intended to represent an absolute
resistance of 10^. C.G.S., i.e. one ohm. The method employed by the committee

at the recommendation of Sir W. Thomson (it had been originally proposed by

Weber) consisted in observing the deflection from the magnetic mea-idian of a needle
suspended at the centre of a coil of insulated wire, which formed a closed circiut,
and was made to revolve with uniform and known speed about a vertical axis.
From the speed and deflection in combination with the mean radius of the coil and
the nimiber of its turns, the absolute resistance of the coil, and thence of any other

standard, can be determined.

     About ten years later Kohlrausch attacked the problem by another method,

which it would take too long to explain, and arrived at the result that tlie B.A.

--unit was equal to 1'02 ohms about two per cent, too large. Rowland, in

America, by a comparison between the steady battery current flowing in a primary

coil with the transient current developed in a secondary coil when the primary
current is reversed, found that the B.A. unit was 'OOl ohms. Lorentz, using a
different method agaiu, found -OSO, while H. "Weber, from distinct experiments,
arrived at the conclusion that the B.A. unit was correct. It will be seen that

the results obtained by these highly competent observers range over about four

per cent. Two new determinations ha^e lately been made in the Cavendish

laboratory at Cambridge, one by myself with the metliod of the revolving coil, and
another by Mr. Glazebrook, who used a modification of the method followed by

Rowland, with the result that the B.A. unit is -986 ohms. I am now engaged

upon a third determination, using a method which is a modification of that of

Lorentz.

     In another important part of the field of experimental science, where the
subject-matter is ill imderstood, and the work is qualitative rather than quantita-
tive, success depends more directly upon sagacity and genius. It must be admitted

that much labour spent in this kind of work is ill directed. Bullty records of crude
and uninterpreted observations are not science, nor even in many cases the raw
material out of which science M'ill be constructed. The door of experiment stands
always open ; and when the question is ripe, and the man is found, he wiU nine
times out of ten find it necessary to go through the work again. Observations
made by the way, and imder unfavourable conditions, may often give rise to valuable
suggestions, but these must be tested by experiment, in which the conditions are

simplified to the utmost, before they can lay claim to acceptance.

   When an ixnexpected eifect is observed, the question will arise whether or not

   an explanation can be found upon admitted principles. Sometimes the answer can

   be quickly jjiven ; but more often it will happen that an assertion of what ought

   to have been expected can only be made as the result of an elaborate discussion of

   the circumstances of the case, and this discussion must generally be mathematical

   in its spirit, if not in its ibrm. In repeating-, at the beginning of the century, the

   well-known experiment of the inaudibility of a bell rung in vacuo, Leslie made the

   interesting observation that the presence of hydrogen was inimical to the produc-

   tion of sound, so that not merely was the sound less in hydrogen than in air of

   equal pressure, but that the actual addition of hydrogen to rarefied air caused a

   Howdiminution in the intensity of soimd.  is this remarkable fact to be explained ?

   Does it prove that, as Ilerschel was inclined to think, a mixture of gases of widely

   diiferent densities difi'ers in its acoustical properties from a single gas ? These

   questions could scarcely be answered satisfactorily but b}' a mathematical investi-

   gation of the process by which -sibratious are communicated from a vibrating solid

   body to the surrounding gas. Such an investigation, founded exclusively upon

   principles well established before the date of Leslie's observation, was imdertaken

   years afterwards by Stokes, who proved that what Leslie observed was exactly

   what ought to have been expected. The addition of hydrogen to attenuated air

   increases the wave-length of vibrations of given pitch, and consequently the

   facility with which the gas can pass round the edge of the bell from the advancing

   to the retreating face, and thus escape those rarefactions and condensations which

   are essential to the formation of a complete sound-wave. There remains no reason

   for supposing that the phenomenon depends upon any other elements than the

   density and pressure of the gaseous atmosphere, and a direct trial, e.g. a compari-

   son between air and a mLxture of carbonic aniiydride and hydrogen of like density,

   is almost superfluous.

   Examples such as this, which might be multiplied ad libitum, show how diffi-

   cult it often is for an experimenter rightly to interpret his results without the aid

   of mathematics. It is eminently desirable that the experimenter himself shoidd be

   in a position to make the calculations, to which his work gives occasion, and

   from which in return he would often receive valuable hints for fiu'ther experiment.

   I shoidd like to see a course of mathematical instruction arranged with especial

   reference to physics, within which those whose bent was plainly towards experi-

   ment might, more or less completely, confine themselves. Probably a year spent

   judiciously on such a course woidd do more to qualify the student for actual work

   than two or three years of the usual mathematical curricidum. On the other side,

   it must be remembered that the human mind is limited, and that few can carry

   the weight of a complete mathematical armament without some repression of their

   energies in other directions. With many of us difficulty of remembering, if not

   want of time for acquiring, would impose an early limit. Here, as elsewhere, the

   natural advantages of a division of labour will assert themselves. Innate dexterity

   and facility in contrivance, backed by unflinching perseverance, may often conduct

   to successful discovery or invention a man who has little taste for specidation ; and
   on the other hand the mathematician, endowed with genius and insight, may find a

   sufficient field for his energies in interpreting and systematising the work of others.

   The difierent habits of mind of the two schools of physicists sometimes lead

   them to the adoption of antagonistic views on doubtful and difficult questions.

   The tendency of the purely experimental school is to rely almost exclusively upon

   direct evidence, even when it is obviously imperfect, and to disregard arguments

   which they stigmatise as theoretical. The tendency of the mathematician is to

   overrate the solidity of his theoretical structures, nnd to forget the narrowness of

   the experimental foundation upon which many of them rest.
       By direct observation, one of the most experienced and successful experimenters

   of the last generation convinced himself that light of definite refrangibility was

   capable of further analysis by absorption. It has happened to myself, in the course

   of measurements of the absorbing power of various media for the different rays of

   the spectrum, to come across appearances at fii-st sight strongly confirmatory of

   Brewster's views, and I can therefore understand the persistency with which lie

I
440 REPORT-- 18 82.

retained liis opinion. But the possibility of further analysis of light of definite
refrangihility (except by polarisation) is almost irreconcilable with the wave
theory, which on the strongest grounds had been already accepted by most of
Brewster's contemporaries ; and in consequence his results, though urgently pressed,
failed to convince the scientitic world. Further experiment has fully justified
this scepticism, and in the hands of Airy, Helmholtz, and others, has shown that
the phenomena by which Brewster was misled can be explained by tbe unrecognised
intrusion of ditl'used light. The anomalies disappear when sufficient precaution is

taken that the refrangihility of the light observed shall really be definite.

    On similar grounds undulationists early arrived at the conviction that physically

light and invisible radiant heat are both vibrations of the same kind, differing
merely in wave-length ; but this view appears to have been accepted slowly, and
almost reluctantly, by the experimental school.

     ANTien the facts which appear to conflict with theory are well-defined and lend
themselves easily to experiment and repetition, there ought to be no great delay in
arriving at a judgment. Either the theory is upset, or the observations, if not
altogether faulty, are found susceptible of another interpretation. The difficulty is
greatest when the necessary conditions are uncertain, and their fulfilment rare and

uncontrollable. In many such cases an attitude of reserve, in expectation of further
evidence, is the only wise one. Premature judgments err perhaps as much on
one side as on the other. Certainly in the past many extraordinar}' observations
have met with an excessive incredulity. I may instance the fire-balls which some-
times occm- dui'ing violent thunderstorms. AVhen the telephone was first invented,
the early reports of its performances were discredited by many on quite insufficient

grounds.

     It would be interesting, but too difficult and delicate a task, to enumerate and
examine the various important questions which remain still undecided from the
opposition of direct and indirect evidence. Merely as illustrations I will mention
one or two in which I happen to have been interested. It has been sought to
remedy the inconvenience caused by excessive reverberation of sound in cathedrals
and other large unfurnished buildings by stretching wires overhead from one wall
to another. In some cases no difference has been perceived, but in others it is
thought that advantage has been gained. From a theoretical point of view it is
difficult to believe that the wires could be of service. It is known that the
vibrations of a wire do not communicate themselves in any appreciable degree
directly to the air, but require the intervention of a sounding-board, from which

we may infer that vibrations in the air would not readily communicate themselves

to stretched wires. It seems more likely that the advantage supposed to have been
gained in a few cases is imaginary than that the wires should really have played

the part attributed to them.

     The other subject on which, though with diffidence, I should like to make a
remark or two, is that of Front's law, according to which the atomic weights
of the elements, or at any rate of many of them, stand in simple relation to that
of hydrogen. Some chemists ha^иe reprobated strongly the importation of
a priori views into the consideration of the question, and maintain that the
only numbers worthv of recognition are the immediate results of experiment.
Othej's, more impressed by the argument that the close appro.ximations to simple
numbers cannot be merely fortuitous, and more alive to tlie inevitable imperfec-

tions of our measurements, consider that the experimental evidence against the
simple numbers is of a very slender character, balanced, if not outweighed, by the
a priori argument in favour of simplicity. The subject is eminently one for further

experiment; and as it is now engaging the attention of chemists, we may look for-
ward to the settlement of the question by the present generation. The time has
perhaps come when a re-determination of the densities of the principal gases may

--be desirable an undertaldng for which I have made some preparations.

      If there is any truth in the views that I have been endeavouring to impress,
our meetings in this Section are amply justified. If the progress of science demands
the comparison of evidence drawn from different sources, and fullj' appreciated only

by minds of different orders, what may we not gain from the opportunities here given

for public discussion, aud, perhaps more -Naluable still, private interchange of
opinion ? Let us endeavour, one and all, to turn them to the best account.

       3. On the Tension of Mercunj Vapours at Common Temperatures.
                        By Professor Lord Ratleigh, F.R.S.

      Tlie author called attention to the difficulty of reconciling- the values of

Eegnault and Ilagen with the phenomena observed by Crookes relating to the
viscosity of gases at high exhaustions. The total gaseous pressure in the working
chamber canuot be less than that of the mercury at the pump. If the penetration
of mercury vapour be prevented by chemical means, some other gas must be
present in equivalent quantity. If the value of Regnault and Ilagen is sub-

stantially correct, it does not appear how the phenomena coidd vary so much as

they are observed to do at the highest degrees of exhaustion as measm-ed by the
Macleod gauge. The question then arises whether the value of mercury tension

hitherto received may not be much in excess of the truth. In Ilagen's researches

it is assumed without reason that the pressure in a chamber of variable tempe-
rature is governed by the temperature of the coldest part, but this consideration
tells in the wrong direction. It was suggested that possibly a change in the
capillary constant, or currents in the fluid mercury at the chilled surface of the
meniscus, might have had something to do with the minute changes of level which
have been attributed to difl'erences of pressure in the mercury vapour.

                  4. On the Yelocity of White and Coloured Light.

     The author gave an account of the experiments made by him in conjunction with
Dr. James Young, F.R.S. , with a view to determining the velocity of light. This
researcli has been published in the Transactions of the Royal Society. The chief

point of interest is that it appears that the velocity of blue light is greater than
that of red, the ditlerence being between 1 and 2 per cent, of the whole velocity.

5. Preliminarn Account of Results obtained during the late total Solar

     Eclipse {May 17, 1882). By Dr. Aethur Schuster, F.R.S., and

      Captain Abney, F.R.S.

     Three photographs of the corona were obtained with different exposures. The
comet Tewfik, discovered during the eclipse, appears on the photographs, and the
change in its position on successive plates shows that it was receding from the sun.

A plate exposed in a camera, which had a prism in frout of the lens, showed a

series of impressions corresponding to the different kinds of light sent out by the
prominences. It is seen from this that diflerent prominences were at different
temperatures. The most intense image in every case corresponds to the calcium

lines.

   A photograph obtained in a complete spectroscope gives a complicated promi-

nence spectrum, a strong continuous spectrum in the lower parts of the corona, a
reversal of the solar line CI in the upper regions, and a great number of coronal

lines in the blue, violet, and ultra-violet.

                          By Dr. Arthur Schuster, F.E.S.

     Observations of tlie sliape assumed by the solar corona in successive eclipses
during the last fifteen years have shown remarkable changes coincident with the

sunspot period. The corona of sunspot minimum is characterised by a certain
symmetry about an axis not far removed from the sun's axis of rotation, but very

likely not quite coincident either with it or with an axis perpendicidar to the plane

of the ecliptic. Some apparent irregularities in the symmetry seem to be due to

differences in the position of the earth in its annual orbit. Changes in the spectro-
scopic and polariscopic properties of the corona which are coincident and con-
nected with the changes of form seem to point to a partly meteoric origin of the

corona.

          8. On the Photographic Spectrum of Comet (Wells) 1, 1882.
                  By William Huggins, B.C.'L., LL.D., F.B.S.

                                    [Plate IX.]

Last year I had the honour of presenting to the British Association an account of

a photograph of the spectrum of the brightest comet of that yeai', accompanied by

some remarks on the unity of type of spectrum of all the comets to which the

spectroscope had been applied since 1864.

The bright comet of the present year presents, for the first time, a spectrum

differing essentially from the hydrocarbon type to which aU the other comets

belonged.

Observations of the visible region of tlie spectrum had already showed the

probable absence of the usual hydrocarbon groups, one or two observers suspecting

only the brightest of the groups. The comet gave a brilliant continuous spectrum,

Dand also a bright double line coincident witli that of sodiimi at of the spectrum,

and some other bright lines.

    On May 31, I obtained a photograph of the spectrum of this comet. The plate

was exposed for one hour and a quarter. Through the second half of the slit I took

on the same plate a spectrum of a Ursa majoris for the determination ui position of

the lines of the comet's spectrum.

    The photographic plate showed a strong continuous spectrum extending from

Fabout to a little beyond II.

In the continuous spectrum of the comet of last year the Fraunhofer lines were

clearly visible, but in the stronger continuous spectrum of the present comet, I was

not able to distinguish any of these solar lines.

The slit was indeed more open than was the case last year, and this circumstance

Gwould make these lines less distinct, but tlie lines and II are weU seen in the

Westar's spectrum taken under the same conditions.  may conclude therefore that

the part of the comet's original light whicli gives a continuous spectrum is much

stronger relatively to the reflected solar light in this comet than was the ease in

the comet of last year, and for this reason the Fraunhofer lines are not to

be seen.

In agreement with eye observations made in the visible region, this photo-

graph does not contain the strong ultra-violet group assigned to cyanogen ; also

G Hthe bright groups of the comet of last year between and /;, and between /* and

do not appear to be present.

In the continuous spectrum at least five places of greater brightness can be dis-

tinguished, which undoubtedly represent groups of bright lines, though they are

not sufficiently distinct in the photograph to admit of resolution into lines. The

correctness of this interpretation is rendered much more probable by the circum-

stance that these groups, as is shown in the diagram, project beyond the strong con-

                                                                                       I

tinuous spectrum on one side. The head of the comet was in sharp focus upon the

slit, and the continuous spectrum with defined edges corresponds to the nucleus,

which in this comet was very distinct. Tlie side of tlie spectrum on wliich these

suspected groups project corresponds to the liglit of the corona on the side of the

Wenucleus next the sun.  learn, therefore, that the light of this part of tlie coma

consisted chiefly, in this region of the spectrum, of these groups ; as, on the plate,
only a very faint continuous spectrum can be seen between these projected parts

of the bright spaces.
     It is not possible to measure with accuracy the beginnings and endings of

these groups. Measures as accurate as the circumstances would permit have been
taken, therefore, of the brightest parts of the groups. The wave-lengths of these

brightest parts are :

                         X4253

                         ,, 4412

                         ,, 4769

    As the lines of sodium were strong in the visible part, it may be that some of
the light producing some of these groups may be due to that substance.

    Mr. Hind has kindly furnished me with the distance of this comet from tlie sun

at the time the photograph was taken. The comet was then 42,380,000 miles
from the sun, while the comet of last year was distant 69,420,000 when I obtained
the photograph of its spectrum. Considering the fact that the presence of sodium

and the absence of the hydrocarbon groups were observed some time previously to

the taking of the photograph, when the comet was much farther from the sun, we

cannot attribute this difl'erence of spectrum directly to greater heat through a

nearer approach to the sun, but must regard it as arising from a diflerent chemical
constitution of the cometary stuff. Professor A. Ilerschel and Dr. von Konkoly

showed long ago that the spectra of the periodic meteors are different for

different swarms, and it is not surprising that the nuclei of comets should differ

chemically.

     If the light of comets is due to electric discharges, then, although these dis-
charges woidd owe their existence to solar heat, their heating effect upon the
cometary matter might not be strictly proportional to the nearness of the comet

to the sun. In this case too the absence of the liydrocarbon lines might not neces-

sarily indicate the freedom of the cometary matter from these substances. It has

long been known how preferential is an electric discharge when several substances

are present at the same time, and Dr. Hasselberg has recently shown by some

spectrum fades out. Notwithstanding these considerations, it is probable that

the comet of this year owed the exceptional character of its spectrmn to some

unusual chemical condition of the meteoric matter which forms its nucleus.

  -- --[P.S.] November 14. The spectrum of the great comet which was discovered

near the sun in September was similar in the visible region to that of comet

Wells. Now that this comet has receded from the sun the lines of sodium are

fainter, and the hydrocarbon groups seen in former comets have made their appear-

ance. These observations support the view taken in this paper, but suggest that
the chemical state of the matter of these two comets is not essentially different from
that of former comets, but is probably a modification of the same fundamental

     In September 1864 ^ I had the honour to announce to the Royal Society that
I had discovered that certain of the Nebuloe (up to that time, eight in number),
give a spectrum of bright lines. In one nebula four bright lines were observed.

444 EEPORT-- 1882.

      In January 1865/ I found that the light of the Great Nebula of Orion is re-
solved into the same set of bright lines. Further observations on the spectrum of
the nebula in Orion, and the spectra of other nebulae, were made subsequently with
more powerful apparatus.^

     The result of these observations was to show that in the visible region, the
spectrum of the Great Nebula in Orion consists of four bright lines, the positions
of which are X 5005, 4957, 4861 , and 4340. The least refi-angible line appeared,
in the instrument used, to be coincident with the less refrangible component of
the brightest double line of the spectrum of nitrogen. The third and fourth lines
agreed in position with the lines /3 and y of the hydrogen spectrum, with which
they were compared directly in the spectroscope.

     During the last few years I have made several attempts to extend our know-
ledge of the spectra of the nebulae into the more refrangible region beyond the
reach of the eye by means of photography. On March 7 last (1882), I succeeded
in obtaining a photograph of the spectrum of the Great Nebula in Orion.

     The apparatus was the same with which I had photographed the spectra of
stars, aud the spectrum of comet h, 1881. It consists essentially of a spectroscope
furnished with a prism of Iceland spar, and lenses of quartz, placed so that the
slit shall be in the principal focus of a metallic speculum 18 inches in diameter,
and driven by an electrically controlled clock.

     A. gelatine plate was used very sensitive from about Fraunhofer's h of the

иspectrum, to a long distance in the ultra-violet.

     The exposure was limited by the coming up of clouds to about 45 minutes.

The opening of the slit was made wider than in my work on the stars. The slit

was kept upon a bright part of the nebula near the trapezium in the ' Fish's

moulli ' of the nebula.

     The photographic plate shows a spectrum of bright lines sufficiently distinct to
admit of measurement ; there is also present an exceedingly faint continuous spec-
trum.

    In my eye-observations of the visible region of the spectrum, I was nearly always

conscious of the presence of a faint continuous spectrum, but in no part of the
Debula did this continuous spectrum become strong relatively to the bright lines,
which were present throughout the whole extent of the nebula.

     The great range of the s]iectrum to which the plate was sensitive enabled me

to see upon it all the lines which had been previouslj^ observed with the eye. In
addition to these known lines the plate shows a relatively strong line in the ultra-
Tiolet region, which is new to us.

     As the slit was wide, this line appears broad on the plate, but for the same
reason so do also the known lines. Eye-observations have shown these lines to be

extremely narrow and defined at the edges. There is reason to believe that this

new line, though relatively intense, is similar in character to the other lines,
namely, narrow and defined. The great advantage of this control from lines
common to the photographic plate and to observations by eye, is seen further in
the following circumstance. The spaces occupied on the plate by the broad lines

do not appear to be quite imiform, but somewhat less strong in the middle ; but
the results of the eye-observations show conclusively, as might be suspected for

other reasons, that this appearance does not indicate duplicity of the lines, but

simply a want of absolute precision of focal adjustment.
     The broad character cin the plate of this new line does not permit of quite the

same accuracy of determination of position as would have been possible with a
narrower slit. There is little doubt, however, that this new line agrees in position
with the line ^ of the typical spectrum of the white stars.^ For this reason, this
typical spectrum has been placed in the diagram by the side of the photographic
spectrum of the nebula. The wave-length of the new line is therefore X 3730.

      There can be little doubt that this typical spectrum is due to hydrogen, and

that this new line in the nebula, as well as the two less refrangible lines which

had been observed by the eye, are produced by this substance.
    It is of much interest to compare the extreme differences of character of these

lines of hydrogen which are common to the white stars and to the nebula. lu

the stars these lines are very broad and winged at the edges, while in tjie nebula
they are of exceeding thinness and wholly free from a winged condition, indicating
great differences in tlie temperature and density of the gas as it exists in these two

orders of celestial bodies.

     I cannot say positively whether the lines of hydrogen between Ily and the
line fat 3730, which are present in the stars, are altogether absent in this nebula.
If they exist in the spectrum of the nebula they must be exceedingly faint rela-

tively to those present. I suspect a want of uniformity of the film at this part,,
and also beyond X 3730, and this may indicate possibly the presence of very faint

lines. Uud"er the most favourable co'nditious of illumination, I am almost certain

of faint lines at the positions of /* and H. In the diagram only those lines about
which there can be no imcertainty are inserted, and the new line is made broad

for the purpose of indicating its great intensity relatively to the other lines.

    In my laboratory experiments, I have succeeded in obtaining spectra of hydro-

gen in which some of the lines in this region are either absent or very greatly
reduced in intensity, but I have not yet obtained a spectrum which represents a
state of things precisely similar to that which obtains in this nebula.

              1. On the Absolute Measurement of Electric Currents.

                          Bij Professor Lokd Rayleigh, F.B.S.

     The accurate absolute measurement of currents seems to be more difficult than
that of resistance. The methods hitherto employed require either accurate mea-
surements of the earth's horizontal intensity, or accurate measiu-ements of coils of
small radius and of many turns. If in the latter measurement we could trust to
the inextensibility of the wire, as some experimenters have thought themselves
able to do, the mean radius could be accurately deduced from the total length of

wire and the number of turns; but actual trial has convinced me that fine wire

stretches very appreciably imder the tension necessary for winding a coil satis-
factorily. Kohlrausch's method, in which the same current is passed through an
absolute galvanometer, and through a coil suspended bifilarly in the plane of
the meridian, is free from the above difficulty ; but it is not easy so to arrange the
proportions that the suspended coil shall be sufficiently sensitive, and the galvano-
meter sufficiently insensitive. In this method, as in that of the dynamometer,

the calculation of the forces requires a knowledge of the moment of inertia of the

suspended parts.

    When the electromagnetic action is a simple attraction or repulsion, it can be

determined directly by balancing it against known weights. In Mascarfs recent

determination a long solenoid is suspended vertically in the balance, and is acted

upon by a flat coaxial coil of much larger radius, whose plane includes the lower

extremity of the solenoid. This arrangement, though simple to think about, does
not appear to be the one best adapted to secure precise results. It is evident that
a large part of the solenoid is really ineffective, those turns which he nearly in
the plane of the flat coil being but little attracted, as well as those which lie to-
wards the further extremity. The result calculated from the total length of wire
(even if this could be trusted), the length of the solenoid, and the number of turns,
has an appearance of accuracy which is illusory, unless it can be assumed that the
distribution of the wire over the length is strictly uniform. It would appear that

all the turns of the suspended coil should operate as much as possible, that is, that
--446 REPORT 1882.

the suspended coil should be compact, and should he placed in the position of

maximum effect.

There is a further incidental advantaf^e in this arrangement, which it is the

principal object of the present note to point out. The expression for the attrac-

tion involves as factors the product of the numbers of turns, the square of the
current, and a function of the mean radii of the two coils, and of the distance

hetween their mean planes. Now, as may he seen from the fact that the square

of a current is already of the dimensions of a force, this function of three linear

quantities is itself of no dimensions. In determining its actual value we should
in general be subject to three errors ; but when the position is such that the func-
tion (for two given coils) is a maximum, the result is practically dependent only
upon the two mean radii, and being of no dimensions can involve them only in the

form of a ratio. In order then to calculate the result, all that it is necessary to

know with precision is the ratio of the mean radii of the two coils. This ratio

can be obtained electrically, with full precision, and without any linear measure-

ments. For, if the two coils considered as galvanometer coils are brought coaxially

into the same plane, the ratio of their constants can be found by the known method
of dividing a current between them in such a way that no effect is produced upon
a smaU magnet suspended at their common centre. The ratio of the resistances

in multiple arc gives the ratio of the currents, and this again (subject to small cor-

rections for the finite size of the sections), gives the ratio of the mean radii.
    It appears that in this way aU that is necessary for the absolute determination

of currents can be obtained without measurements of length, or of moments of

inertia, or even of absolute angles of deflection. In practice it will be desirable

to duplicate the fixed coil, placing the suspended coil midway between two similar

Afixed ones, through which the current passes in opposite directions.         rough

approximation to the condition of things above described will be quite sufficient.

2. On the Duration of Free Electric Currents in an Infinite Conducting
             Cylinder. By Professor Lord Rayleigh, F.E.S.

Taking the axis of the cylinder as that of s, we suppose that the currents are

functions of +v'(-i'' y^)> or r, only, and flow in the circles r = constant.

    From the equations given in jNIaxwell's ' Electricity,' vol. ii. ДД 691, 508, 607,
610, 611, we may deduce for a conductor of constant

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 fj.

     4t. On a Neiv Hand Dynamo-Machiiie. Bij W. H. Preece, F.B.S.

    The author described a compact dynamo-machine designed by the Baron de
Meritens for lecturing, teaching, and laboratory pin-poses. It consists of a Pacinotti

armature rotating in an electro-magnetic iield of the Gramme type. It gives a

continuous current and produces an electromotive force of 70 volts. The resis-
tances of the armature and of the field magnets are 4 ohms each. One man can
thus produce a current of one ampere through an Edison incandescent lamp with
great ease, and four men can illumine four such lamps. The cost of the instrument
was 350 francs in Paris.

        5. 0)1 Secondare/ Batteries, ivith special reference to Local Action.

                         By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.8.

     The elements of which a Plants battery and its various modifications consist
are metallic lead, peroxide of lead, and dilute sulphuric acid. The reaction that
takes place is the combination of the positive metal with SO^, forming PbSO^,
and the reduction of the PbO,, by means of the hydrogen to PbO, which in the
presence of sulphirric acid is also converted into sulphate of lead and water. The
amount of force which can be obtained from a cell depends upon the amount of

peroxide of lead which is capable of being reduced. Now the negative plate of

these secondary batteries is itself an arrangement of lead and lead peroxide, and if
immersed in dilute sulphuric acid galvanic action is at once set up. This ' local
action ' is, fortunately, soon diminished by the formation of the badly-conducting
sulphate of lead upon the surfaces of the lead plate and crystals of peroxide.

When the two plates are brought into connection the discharge takes place be-

tween them, but the local action on the negative plate is not stopped. This is

shown by the much larger amount of sulphate of lead produced on the negative
than on the positive plate. In three experiments in wliich the resistance was
varied this increase amounted to 15, 34, and 53 per cent, respectively. The
amount of available peroxide of lead that may have been thus destroyed on any nega-

tive plate is not easily recognised, for the electromotive force is not affected, and the

current obtainable in the first instance is not much reduced, though of course the
same amount of work cannot be got out of the battery.

     This local action takes place also during the formation of a cell. One of the
proofs of this is that much more oxygen is absorbed than could possibly be
absorbed in the oxidation of the minium used in a Faure cell ; indeed, in one
experiment which was continued for 115 hours, it was found that a small amount
of oxygen was being continuously absorbed, though the main action was complete
in less than 40 hours. This was attributed to the formation of sulphate at the
expense of the lead plate, and its subsequent oxidation.

    As this local action impairs the value of these secondary batteries, it becomes

                  6. Demands of a System of Electrical Distribtition.
                             By F. J. Spragde, JI.S. Navy.

     The multiple arc system of distribution, having the advantages of simplicity,
independence of circuits, and reliability, is the only one which can have any wide-
spread application for domestic purposes where the current is taken directly from

the generators. Considering a single machine, the external resistauce diminishes

with the increase in the number of circuits, the current varies inversely with the
external resistance, and the potential at the terminal remains constant,' while the
electromotive force of the machine does not. If r is the ratio of external to
internal resistance, IS the electromotive force developed when these resistances are
equal, and E' the electromotive force when ; has some other value than one, then

The curve being traced shows :

     1st. In a single generator the electromotive force is not proportional to the
number of lights or motors or the current developed.

    2nd. No matter how liigh the external resistance, or how limited the number

of derived circuits, the electromotive force of a machine required to maintain a

fixed diflerence of potential at the terminals, can never be less than one-half that

developed when the external and internal resistances are equal.
     3rd. The increase of electromotive force required as the external resistance

decreases, or the number of derived circuits is increased, is very gradual up to the
point where the external resistance is three or four times the" internal, beginning

then to rise more rapidly.

When4th.       the external resistance falls below the internal, the rise is very

rapid, and if this diflference is marked, then it becomes impossible to maintain a

fixed diflference of potential, because of the great increase necessary in the strength

Aof the magnetic field and the velocity of the armature.  great amount of heat,

and consequently wasted energy, would be developed in the armature.

In a general system there would be a low external resistance and large currents,

the energies of which are proportional to the squares.

     Consequently the resistance of lamps should be high; but there is a limit,
determined principally by the illumination required, and the potential. Since for

a given illuminating surface small section carbons give the highest resistance and

least mass, we should diminish the diameter and increase the length and resistance

of carbon, meeting this by an increase of potential. Several reasons, one of the

principal being_ safety, indicate about 150 volta as the limit at the terminal of

the lamp circuits. With a given standard, it is necessary to have also lamps of

higher power.   For  this we must  increase the width   of carbons,  or  their  length,

               _

while the specific resistance is reduced. Flat carbons are preferable to circular

ones, because the resistance of the last diminishes as the square of the increase of

surface.

The energy required for a system is expended in overcoming friction and

inertia, magnetising useless parts, and generating currents which do work in the

armature, field coils, conductors, and lamps. Of these, the work required for
friction and inertia, and for the field magnets, is about the same whatever the

niunber of lights on a single machine. Various considerations lead me to the

following conclusions :

     1. The resistance of the armature of the generator should be as low as possible

compatible with the power to furnish the necessary electromotive force.

     2. The generator should be able to produce this electromotive force with the

field magnet at less than the maximum economic saturation, and at a velocity lesa
than that at which the armature can be safely run, in order that there may be a

margin for increased efficiency in case of an unexpected demand.
                                                                      TKAXSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                                   449

    3. The lamps and motor should have a high resistance, the standard lamp not

higher than 475 to 500 ohms.

    4. The resistance of the conductor should be as low as practicable, and should

be graded in size for the current required.

    5. The electromotive force of the generator should never rise to over 170 volts.
    6. The lamps should be simple of construction, durable and cheap, and all

alike.

    7. The generator and the engine should be of the most substantial construction.
    8. The points of derivation should all have, and all be maintained at, the same

difference of potential as nearly as possible.

    9. The energy necessarily lost in armature and conductors of any fixed resist-

ance for lamps of the same absolute economy varies inversely as the resistance of

the lamps, or as the squares of the currents used.

     10. Since in a single generator the total power used is not proportional to the

number of lamps in circuit, a machine should be run nearly to its maximum

capacity.

    11. There should not be a single generator or a single circuit which maybe

destroyed ; but there should be such an arrangement that the external demands,

both with regard to resistance and current required, may be met by suitable

changes in the resistance and supply of the generative system.

     12. The relation of internal and external resistance should be in a system the
same as exists in a single generator when worked to nearly its full capacity.

     13. With such proper relation of internal and external resistance the electro-

motive force will vary but slightly, and the power used will be very nearly pro-
portional to the number of lamps or the current developed.

     14. Insulation of conductors and of the armatures should be good, and provision
made to prevent fire arising from an abnormal increase of current.

    15. Means should exist of accurately measuring the current used.

    AIG. large system should be as economical as a single generator worked

nearly to its full capacity, and should be capable of regulation with the same ease.

    Much has been said about the subdivision of the electric light and the subdivision

of  the current                                                       and such subdivision  of  electricity has  been  the  great  bugbear in
                                                                   ;

the distribution of power and light by its means. This term, while conveying

an idea, is in reality essentially wrong. It implies the existence of a current,

the expenditure of energy, before the required subdivision of such current is made.

A current is a function, not only of potential, but of potential and resistance.
We desire to establish a certain potential, or difference of potential, and to maintain

this so that when a circuit is established, a channel opened, a current may be
Weestablished in that circuit.
                                                                      do not divide a current, do not divide a potential,

but having established a difference of potential in two conductors, we open one or

more paths, and a current flows over these paths dependent on their resistance,

and independent of each other, and such additional current having been formed,

the current over the main conductor is increased by just such increment, which

increment did not exist until the new path was made. There has been no sub-

division of a current, there has been a creation. Such new current havino- been
made, of course more power must be supplied to maintain the existing poten'tial.

    7. 0)1 the Comimrison of the Mercur// with the Hydrogen Thermometer.

   A thermometer filled with air or some other gas is the standard instrument for

measuring temperature, and a correction is necessary to bring the results of a
mercury thermometer into accord with this standard. The only table of corrections

for temperatures above 100 degrees Centigrade is that published by Eegnault

thirty years ago. It has been found that this does not apply to the instruments in

use to-day, and a new series of determinations has been made of a number of
French and of one German thermometer, giving results so concordant that a new

table for general use can be founded upon them.

    The deviation of the mercury from the gas thermometer is much smaller than

    1882.                                                                                   GG

that found by Regnault, and lead-glass and common German glass have given

nearly identical results.

   A method of treatment to prevent considerable changes of the zero points of

mercury thermometers is proposed to be applied to all thermometers before gi-adua-

tion, and a new method for graduating thermometers in short sections is recom-

mended, which is founded upon a series of determinations of the boiling points of
certain pure substances.

or adding and reducing

                 Zx.y^z, = 36╗ + YjZi + ZjXj + XiYj.

This equation (since Xj Yj are rational in x and y) is, when cubed, the complete

integral of the difi'erential equation

                 Y-%X-irf.f +                                                                                                      = 0.

It will be found to be

              27 XYZ = {SDxyz + G{yz + zx + xy) + BGr + y + s) + 3A}

The developed equation is of the form

                         a + hy + g2/2 + py3
                 + X {h + by + fy'~ + qy^}

                 + .r' {p + qy^ + ry^ + dy'' } = 0.

The coefficients, of which ten are different, are therefore derivable from a matrix
of the form of the determmant which expresses the discriminant of the general

quadric surface

             It = a.i- + by- + cs'^ + 2fys + 2gs,r + 2h.ry + 2p.r + 2qy + 2rs + d = 0.

(Compare Cayley, ch. xiv. p. 340, ' Elliptic Functions.')

     The result shows that the complete integral of the differential equation is an
equation =Фt 0, where it is a symmetric cubi-cubic function of (.f, y) : that is, a sym-

metric function, cubic in regard to each variable separately.

5. On the Establishment of the Elementary Principles of Quaternions on
                  an Analytical Basis.^ By Gustate Plarr, D.Sc.

     The writer is of opinion, that for the purpose of initiating the student into the

knowledge of the principles of quaternions, it woidd be more convenient (to many

minds at least) to have these principles established by the analytical method.
This method presents the advantage of founding the analytical properties of vectors
and quaternions on a clear basis, which is no other than definition, and assumption
by definition, and of establishing the geometrical properties on these definitions

by way of interpretation and deduction. This is also the method applied to the

--treatment of the more important applications of quaternions we mean to say, the

method which consists in analytical deduction followed by geometrical interpreta-

tion of the results.

    The working principle by which the geometrical properties may be deduced

will be the following: Assuming that the product of two vectors is to be effected

    ' A Paper by the same author, and bearing the above title, has been communi-

cated by Professor Tait to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and inserted in vol,

by the rule of distributive mtdtiplication, then this product must represent one and
the same result, lohatecer the directions of the components of the factors may he.

    As to details of the way of proceeding, we refer the reader to our paper with the

above title, printed in the 'Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,' vol.

xxvii. ; but in order to give an outline of its contents we may state that we con-
sider in that paper two sets of expressions for two vectors, p and -or. Namely

\w-(1░) [P^'^P^P',

^ Tw\_ Up cos +ptsr U(T sin pw],

w(T being coplanar with p w, and at right angles to p, on the same side as ; and

f P^(и~>░\  *"' +./^ + ^^'

i,j, k being a system of tri-rectangular unit-vectors of any orientation whatsoever.

Forming with each set the expressions

P Q-- pw= p-ar arpf                    =  + Tsrp,

and identifying Pj witli P.,, and Qj with Q.,, we are led to the conclusions
    (1░) That the expressions Up Ua -- Ua- Up, and similar ones in {, j, k, are vectors,

perpendicular to Up, Ua, for the first expression, and perpendicular to /, k, in the

case jk -- kj, and so on.

    (11░) That the expressions Up Uv H- Uv Up, and similar ones in i, j, k, are

scalars, and scalars of one and the same value, namely, the value being equal to

zero. Further deductions present themselves easily.

     The establishment of (C/p)'^=-- ], t"-=-- 1, Sec, on the contrary, must be
made dependent on the discussion cf the product of vector factors at least three in

number.

   6. On Linear Syzygetic Relations between the Coefficients of Ternary
                   Quadrics. By Professor R. "W. Genese, M.A.

     Let {a, h, c,f, y, h){:i; y, =s)'- be a ternary quadric.
     This represents various curves and surfaces according to the system of co-
ordinates and the locus in quo.
     To fix the ideas, consider .c, y, z, as the triliuear co-ordinates of a point, so that

the quadric represents a conic.

be a relation between the coefiicients.

    Then it is known that the conic is such that triangles can be inscribed in it

which are self-conjugate with regard to a fixed conic ; but also that if the multipliers
be themselves connected by the relation

                                                                                                                          I, =

The arc varies as the distance of the moving point from the plane of the small

    7. On the quadratui-e of areas enclosed by the involute of a small circle.
    Two spaces are selected, both bounded by the fixed circle and its involute ; but
the tliird limit may be (1) the rolling great circle, or (2) the radius-vector of the

moving point.

     In (1) an elemental area has been chosen by Olairant, which is comprised
between the involute and two consecutive positions of the generating great circle.

If 6 be the arc subtended at the fixed centre by the arc which has been

traversed, and the equal length of the generating great circle, then

--The area in (1) =
                     c? ^  (cos a -cos ?и) =cot o;    \d             (1 -cos <^) =cot                   a  (0   sin

     Clairant remarks that if from this area a spherical sector be subtracted with
(j) for its vertical angle, the remainder would he strictly quadrable.

In (2) the area = cosec Ф d?- (cos a -- cos r) cosec" r sin* p

-- -= cot a ((^ -- sin (^ ) cos a tan           (tan <f> cosec a) +tan -' (sin <^ cot Ф),

From this area also, if a certain spherical sector be subtracted, the remainder is

strictly quadrable.

8. Bernouilli remarks that the apparent path of the sun's centre is an epitro-

choid, affiliated to the rectifiable epicycloid or involute of a small circle.

     ' If the sun were to move in the ecliptic with a velocity equal to that which

the tropic of Capricorn has to execute the diurnal motion, and so the time of a

revolution of the sun in the ecliptic were to the time of revolution of the sphere,

which constitutes the length of the natural day, in the same ratio which the radius

of the ecliptic (or of the sphere) bears to the radius of the tropic as 1 : cos 23░30',

the centre of the sun would exactly describe a rectifiable epicycloid. But as the

sun has its proper motion in the ecliptic much slower, the line which the centre of

the sun describes between the two tropics during the space of a year by the com-
bined common and proper motion will he a cydoide allangee, rather than a spiral,

under the form that Tycho conceived.'

  --a Synopsis of all previous Reports of this Committee. See Reports, p. 72.

       'J. On the Orirjin of Hail. i?y/ Professor Theodore Schwedoff.

     The size and weight of hail is frequentlj^ such as to cause all the usual theories
as to the origin of hail in currents in the atmosphere to fail. The extreme lowness
of their temperature forbids the idea that they are newly frozen. The researches of
Abich, Secchi, Delcros, and others, leave no doubt that a hailstone is typically a

figure of revolution, a sphere, oblate spheroid, discoid or toroid, often having hol-
lowed poles and even annular. They are also frequently covered with large and

well-developed crystals of clear ice. From these facts, Professor Schwedoff argues

that thej' are of ultra-mundane or cosmical origin, and are in fact a species of
meteorite. The strongest apparent confirmation of this hypothesis is to be found

in the well-established fact of the existence of stony or pyritic nuclei in many

hailstones, which nuclei have been proved to contain iron, nickel, &c.

   3. Notes on Schivedoff's Tlieory of Hail. By Professor Silvanus P.

                                                   Thompson.

      (1) In confirmation of Schwedoff 's views as to the typical form of hailstone
being a figure of revolution, examples were cited from the observations of Darwin,
Humboldt, Bnist, Blanford, Blanchet, CoUadon, Godefroy, and Loomis. The
conical or pyi'amidal forms recently described as typical, Ijy Professor Osborne
Reynolds, could only be regarded as fragments broken from a spherical or spheroidal

fiirm of radial structure.

     (2) As to Schwedoff's theory of a meteoric origin, this could, if accepted at all,

only be accepted for certain cases of hail-falls. Becquerel had long ago divided
hailstorms into 'ordinary' and 'extraordinary'; the latter being independent of
local circumstances. If Schwedofl''s theory were true, there should be regular

hailstone days and hailstone periods. Some evidence appeared to be forthcoming
XKAMSiACTIONJ! OF SKCHON A.  459

of a definite periodicity in the occurrence of hailstorms. It might, moreover, be
reasonably doubted whether the attraction of such small bodies was sutHcieni to
prevent their disappearance by evaporation, supposing them to be capable of exist-

ing outside the atmosphere of the earth.

5. Sun Light and SJcy Light at High Altitudes. By Captain W. de W.

                                                Abney, F.E.S.

     The author called attention to the fact that photographs taken at high altitudes
show skies that are nearly black by comparison with bright objects projected against
them ; and he went on to show that the higher above the sea-level the observer
went, the darker the sky really is, and the fainter the spectrum. In fact, the latter
shows but little more than a band in the violet and ultra-violet at a height of
8,500 feet, whilst at sea-level it shows nearly the whole photographic spectrum.
The only reason of these must be particles of some reflecting matter from which
sunlight is reflected. The author traces this to watery stuft' of which nine-tenths

is left behind at the altitude at which he worked. He then showed that the bright-

ness of the ultra-violet of direct sunlight increased enormously the higher the
observer went, but only to a point, for the spectrum suddenly terminated at about
2,940 wave-lengths. This abrupt absorption was due to extra-atmospheric causes,
and perhaps to space. The increase in brightness of the ultra-violet was such that

Nthe usually invisible rays L, M, and could be distinctly seen, showing that the

visibility of these rays depended on the intensity of the radiation. The red and

ultra-red part of the spectrum was also considered. He showed that the absorption

lines were present in undiminished force and numbers at this high altitude, thus

B Aplacing their origin to extra-atmospheric causes. The and line he also stated

could not be indubitably claimed as telluric lines, but might originate between the
sun and our atmosphere, as they were as strong at the zenith as at the horizon
at this altitude. The author confirmed the presence of derivative benzine and

ethyl in the same region. He had found their presence indicated in the spectrum

at ,sea-level, and found their absorption lines with undiminished intensity at 8,500

feet. Thus, without much doubt, hydrocarbon must exist between our atmosphere
and the sun, and, it may be, in space.

             6. On the Distrihution of Energy in the Solar Spectrum.
                              By Professor S. P. Langlet.

     Of the Avhole solar energy nearly three-fourths, according to the author's
measures, exists in the invisible portion below the red, yet of this great region very

little is known, and of its extent upon the wave-length scale we are hitherto nearly

ignorant. This ignorance arises from ditficulties of research due to the compression
of the infra-red end by the prism, and to the absence of means for separating and
distinguishing individual rays in this crowded portion, or of determining their wave-
length, since no law of connection between wave-lengths and indices of refraction
can be said to be known.

    The object of this communication is to present a map of the energy in this

infra-red portion throughout its entire length, both on the prismatic and wave-

length scale.

     These charts {e.r/nbited) show the distribution of the solar energy through this
hitherto little known region, both on the wave-length and on the pi-ismatic scale.
The measm-es have been made by means of the linear balometer {exhibited) , and
the wave-lengths determined by one of the new concave gratings devised by
Professor Rowland (exhibited). The energies are proportional to the ordinates,
and the approximate wave-length of each ray is given.
460 KEroRT-- 1882.

     It appears that the longest wave of solar energy which passes through our
atmosphere has a length of about 00027mm., or in other words that the spectrum
terminates near 27,000 of Angstrom's scale.

     This investigation is supplementary to another, which is designed to give the
total absorption of each ray both in the solar and terrestrial atmospheres, for by
repeating these measures at great altitudes, and by comparing the absorption at

the centre and limb of the sun, for each i-aj-, we can demonstrate the fact that the
solar photosphere seen without any absorbing medium would appear deeply blue.

     The method of determining the actual colour of the sun (photosphere) by a
special use of Maxwell's colour-discs will be indicated, the approximate result
being that this colour is that of the spectrum F. Some conclusions aftectiug our

customarily received opinions as to the nature of white light will be indicated.

7. On a Similarity between Magnetical and Meteorulogical Weather.
        By Professor Balfour Stewart, M.A., LL.D., F.B.8.

It has been hitherto supposed that there is no traceable likeness between the

magnetical and meteorological changes of the globe. The former have been

imagined to be of a cosmical nature affecting all parts of the earth at the same

moment of time, while the latter are well known to be of a local and progressive

nature. As a matter of fact all attempts to trace a likeness between simultaneous

magnetical and meteorological phenomena have been without success.

There is, however, one class of magnetical phenomena that are of a progressive

nature. I allude to the diurnal variations of the magnetic elements caused by the

--sun. Of these the solar-diurnal variation of the magnetic declination that is to

say, the variation of the position of a freely suspended magnetic needle, is that

which has been most obser\ed and is best understood.

It has been noticed that the diurnal progress of this variation is not unlike that

of atmospheric temperature, the hourly turning-points in both being pretty nearly

the same. Both phenomena too are regulated by the local time at the place of

observation, and hence are of a progi'essive nature, travelling with the sun in his

apparent course from east to west. Both phenomena too are subject to a well-

--marked annual fluctuation the diurnal temperature range, for instance, or the

difference between the indication of the maximum and the minimum thermometers

being greater in summer than in winter, and in like manner the diurnal declination-

range or the difference between the east and the west positions of a suspended

magnet being greater in summer than in winter. Finally both phenomena appear

to be subject to the influence of something which may be called iceather. Some-

times we have very hot days and cold dry nights in which the diurnal temperature-

range is very groat, succeeded by close rainy weather in which the diurnal tempera-

ture-osciUation is very small. In like manner we have sometimes a very large

and at other times a comparatively small diurnal oscillation of the magnetic

needle, so that it too is affected by the influence of magnetic weather. The

--question which I now wish to put is the following : Is there any connection

between these two weathers ? between temperature-range weather and between

Nowdeclination-range weather, both defined as above ?        there is, I think, pre-

liminary evidence to show that both kinds of weather are due very greatly, if not

altogether, to changes in the sun, a large declination-range and a large tempe-

rature-range denoting an increase of solar power. There is also evidence that

temperature-range weather once produced travels from west to east, taking

probably, on an average, eight or nine days to cross the Atlantic. There is also, I

think, preliminary evidence that declination-range weather travels likewise from

west to east, but quicker than temperature-range weather, taking about two days

Nowto cross the Atlantic.  if this be true it might be expected that the decli-

nation-range weather of to-day should be found similar to the temperature-range

иweather six or seven days afterwards, so that by a study of the declination-range

weather of to-day we should be able, with a certain measure of success, to predict

the temperature-range weather six or seven days afterwards.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.  461

      I have here fjiven the train of thought which led to this investigation ; but I
 ought to say that the results obtained do not depend upon the exact truth of every

 step of this train of reasoning. This is in reality a matter-of-fact investigation

 undertaken with the view of ascertaining whether or not there is any recognisable
 connection between these two weathers in Great Britain. The result obtained, I

 may add, was reported to the Solar Physics Committee, and by tliem communi-
 cated to the Royal Society. In order to avoid as much as po.ssible the influence of

 locality I obtained, through the kindness of the Meteorological Council, the diurnal

 temperature-ranges at Stonyhurst, Kew, and Falmouth for the years 1871 and

1872. I obtained likewise, through the Idndness of the Kew Committee, the
 diurnal ranges of magnetic declination at the Kew Observatory for the same two

 years, e.xcluding disturbed observations. The temperature-ranges discussed are
 therefore the means of those at the three observatories above mentioned, and still
 further to tone down or equalise individual fluctuations the daily numbers ex-
 hibited are each the sum of four daily ranges, the two before and the two after.

 Finally, the object being to repreisent fluctuations of range rather than their

 absolute values, a daily series representing the mean of twenty-five daily numbers,
 has been obtained. Each daily number is thus compared with the mean of

 twenty-five daily numbers, both columns being symmetrically placed with regard
 to time, and the dilfei-ences, whether positive or neg.ative, between the two columns,

 is taken to represent temperature-range fluctuations.

    A precisely similar course has been taken with re.spect to the Kew declination

 ranges.

     By this means two years of daily numbers, sometimes positive and sometimes
 negative, representing temperature-range weather, and two years of daily numbers,

 sometimes positive and sometimes negative, representing declination-range weather,

have been obtained.
     The ne.ict object is to compare these two .series with one another.

    Now when two series of waves representing elevations and depressions come

together, it is well known that we shall have the greatest result when the crests

of the one series coincide with the crests of the other, and the smalle.st result-

--perhaps none at all when the crests of the one series coincide with the hollows of

the other. This, indeed, is the well-known explanation of musical beats.

    Now if there be any marked likeness between the two weathers, and if it be

true that declination-ranire weather precedes temperature-weather, the algebraic

sum of the two sets of fluctuations representing these weathers will be greatest
when the declination is pushed forward in point of time, so that the declination
fluctuation of to-day shall be summed up with the temperature fluctuation six or

seven days after. For suppose that the declination fluctuation of to-day is repre-
sented by a very large positive number ; if the above theory be true, the temperature-
fluctuation six or seven days afterwards will be represented by a large positive
number also; so that we shall have the addition of two large po.sitive numbers,

whereas if we add the declination-weather of to-day to the temperature-weather
of to-day it may chance that we are really adding a lai-ge positive to a large nega-

tive quantity, in which case the result will be very small.

     It may also happen that this amount of precedence of declination-weather is

greater at one season of the year than at another.

    We have therefore to pursue a plan somewhat of the following nature. Take a

month's temperature-weather, say, for the month of August, and add to it a month's
declination-weather, extending, say, from July 21 to August 21 ; let the sum be
262. Here the declination-month has been pushed forward eleven days ; next push
it forward twelve days, and let the sum be 273 ; then thirteen dajs, and let the
sum be 276 ; next, fourteen days, and let the sum be 270. It thus appears that

the greatest sum is got Ijy pushing the declination forward thirteen days, and we
may therefore presume that at this season of the year thirteen days denotes the
precedence of the declination weather. On this principle the following table has

been constructed.

     Without entering into minute particulars aa to the details of the method by

which these tables have been obtained, it may be stated that they exhibit an

average oscillation in height something between a third and a quarter of a metre.

    It would appear from these tables that there is a maximum of river-height
about the time of maximum sun-spots, and another subsidiary maximum about
the time of minimum sun-spots. It is of interest to know Avhether the same

behaviour is followed by the river Nile. Through the kindness of General Stone
Pacha, and through the Science and Art Department, South Kensington, inform-
ation has been obtained about this river. This information is of two kinds one
part of it refers to the yearly heights of the Nile, reckoned above the zero of the

Cairo Nilometer, the other to the date of maximum rise.

     This information has been embodied in the following tables:--

      Yearly lieights of the Nile.

Year
464 BEPORT-- 1882.

    It will be seen from the first of these two Nile tables, that we have maximum
heights at 1863 and 1871, years shortly after the epoch of maximum sun-spots,
also, subsidiary maxima at 1853, 1866, and 1876, years near the epoch of mini-

mum sun-spots. So far, then, the Nile agrees with the European rivers in showing

a maximum of height about the time of maximum sun-spots, and a subsidiary
maximum about the time of minimum sun-spots, only this subsidiary maximum

is greater than for the European rivers already named.

    From the second Nile table it will be seen that the date of maximum heights

appears to be latest on those years for which the yearly height is greatest, so that

if we plot curves from the two tables, these curves will be found to be very like

each other. Now the present year is perhaps not very far removed from a
solar maximum, and I am thus induced to think that the Nile may this year

be somewhat late in attaining its maximum rise.

                   4. On Electric Meters. By C. VEimoN Boys.

     The electric meters to which attention is drawn are the energy meter and the
vibrating current meter. The first gives the amount of energy expended by an
electric current in any portion of a circuit during a time, the second gives the
quantity of electricity that has passed in a conductor during a time. As the first
is fully described in the ' Phil. Mag.' of February 1882, 1 do not propose to describe

--it at length. It consists essentially of two parts an indicator, showing the rate at

which electric energy is being expended at a time, and an integrator, to sum these

indications.

     The indicator depends on the principle that the force exerted between two con-

--ductors one conveying the main, and the other, of high resistance, carrying a shunt

--current is proportional to the energy expended by the current between the points

to which the shunt is connected. The shunt circuit consists of a movable solenoid,
wound Avitli a great length of fine wire, the upper half in one direction, and the
lower half in the opposite direction. This is suspended in the annular space between
two fixed solenoids, through each of which the main current passes in the same
direction, so that the upper half is drawn in and the lower pushed away from the
fixed coils. It is suspended from one end of a beam, and balanced with a counter-
weight, and the motion of the beam is resisted by a pendulum-weight. Under these
conditions the tangent of the inclination of the beam is proportional to the energy
of the current, which may therefore be read off on a straight scale of equal parts.
This construction, as I have shown in the paper referred to, absolutely eliminates
inequalities due to the movement of the coils.

     The integrating mechanism, which automatically sums the readings given by
the indicator, is a development of the 'cart' integrator described in the 'Phil.

Mag.' of May 1881. This instrument is an exact mechanical equivalent of the

mathematical principle of integration, which it illustrates most perfectly. Though
                 IRANSACXIONS OF SECTION A.                             465

not convenient for practical purposes, it gave rise to the disc-cylinder integrator,

which is all that can be desired. This consists of a cylinder which is moved longi-

tudinally along its axis, while its surface is in contact with a disc. If the plane of

the disc is parallel to the axis of the cylinder, the latter will not rotate when moved

longitudinally ; if inclined, the revolution of the cylinder will be proportional to the
tangent of such inclination x the longitudinal movement. During the return stroke
of the cylinder, its surface must rest against a disc on the opposite side, that the

revolution may continue in the same direction. The double change of movement

is effected by a * mangle-motion,' driven by clockwork, and the inclination of the
discs by the beam of the indicator. The number of revolutions of the cylinder will
then be a measure of the total energy expended. The author felt hound to
mention that Professor Abdank Abakanowicz had previously invented an inte-
grator depending on the same mathematical principles, but, so far as he could learn,
had not applied them to practical purposes. The author had been accused, not by
Professor Abakanowicz, but by others, of pirating his invention ; but, as he had
never heard of it till he had completed his own, he was innocent of such a charge.

     Besides the simple integrator already explained, he described a series of machines

by which squares, products, quotients, and reciprocals may be directly integrated
among them is a polar planimeter, which is an exact mechanical translation of the

polar expression, \fr^-d6 ; but, as he had not yet applied them to practical purposes,
he did no more than allude to them. For the same reason he referred only to the
apparatus for calculating efficiency ; i.e. apparatus that will automatically divide the
speeds with which two integrals are growing one into the other and continuously

I'ecord the quotient.

     Of the vibrating electric meter it is not possible to give an account in the space

of this abstract.

5. On a new Electrical Contact Maker. By Professor H. S. Hele Shaw.

The author first called attention to the want of an absolutely reliable, and at the

same time sufficiently sensitive, electrical contact-maker. Such an instrument is

often required to measure or control the relative motion of bodies in conjunction

with delicate clockwork. He then proceeded to discuss the ways in which such

contact may be made. In theory, there really is no distinction in the modes of
doing til is, but practically they may be separated into

(1) Relative motion of the two terminal surfaces, normal to both.

(2) Motion tangential to both.
(3) Motion compounded of these two.

These modes were separately discussed, and also the various objections with all

when solid terminals are used. The use of a liquid terminal, with which the other

terminal, being solid, is brought into contact, obviates most of these objections.

Of all liquids, mercury is the only one which can practically be employed. There

are, however, two objections to its use which have prevented its being hitherto

adopted for more than temporary and experimental purposes. These are :

(1) The fact that it readily combines with oxygen on the passage of the

electric spark.

(2) The difficulty of making a contact-maker of this kind portable.

The earliest form of instrument in which the author had endeavoured to over-

come these difficidties, was then shown on a diagi-am and described. Its principle
Aof action is briefly this.
                             short glass tube, closed at the upper end (such as an

inverted test-tube), is filled with mercury, and inverted in a vessel of mercurv.

AThe mercury in the tube is then partially displaced by hydrogen gas.  very light

bent lever, consisting of a platinum wire, passes through the mercury into the

gaseous space, and there makes contact between the mercury below, and a smaller

quantity of mercury in an insulated capside above the other portion, but within the

tube. This lever works on a pivot, being actuated from the outside by the escape-

ment of an ordinary clock, and is extremely sensitive in its action. The positive

and negative poles of the terminals are respectively connected with the mercury in

the capsule and that in the vessel below. It is evident that, although the lever is

always in electrical contact with the latter, the circuit is only completed when it is

brought into contact with the former. Accounts of experiments showing the satis-
factory action with this apparatus were then given. Finally, the most recent form of
apparatus which is portable was illustrated and described.

6. On a Machine for ruling large Diffraction Gratings.
                        By A. IklALLOCK.

     Considerable interest attaches to the rulir.g of diffraction gratings, both on
account of the mechanical difficulties involved in then- production, as well as the

admirable results which are obtained by their means when used for the purpose of

analysing light.  - j.^-

The author did not intend to enter into the general theory of diffraction grat-

ings, further than was necessary to point out the kind of accuracy which must be

attained in ruling them if they are to give anything approaching the best results

but merely to give a short description of a machine made by him for the production

of large gratings, and to mention some of the results obtained by it.

In all optical apparatus, whether lenses, prisms, mirrors, or diffraction gratings,

the unit of length in which errors or deviation from the form or position of lines
must be reckoned, is the wave-length of the light dealt with, and it has been shown

by Lord Rayleigh, and is indeed tolerably obvious when once pointed out, that if,

as is generally the case, the object of an optical siu'faceis to cause the whole of a

wave-front of finite area to reach a certain point in the same phase, a result not

differing much from the best possible will be obtained, if the errors of the surface are

such as not to cause an average disagreement of phase of more than one-fourth of a

wave-length at the focal point.
     The actual value of the permissible error indicated by the above condition is,

for nearly perpendicular refraction and reilection, in glass about half a wave-
length, and in mirrors about one-eighth of a wave-lengtb. For further informa-

tion on these points, the reader is referred to papers by Lord Rayleigh in the ' Phi-
losophical Magazine' (October and December 1879, and January 1880). The

surfaces on which diffraction gratings are ruled should have an accuracy of this
kind, and the accuracy with wliich the lines of the grating are placed should be such
that the projection of their errors of position on the path of the diffracted ray shoidd

not be greater than one-fourth of a wave-length for the first spectrum, or 1 for the

Фth spectrum, if the performance of the grating in that order of spectrum is to

approach perfection.

     These remarks apply when the angle between the incident and diffracted ray is not
very large, i.e. when the distance between the lines is a considerable multiple of the
wave-length. In the limiting case in which a diffi-action spectrum can be formed,

which is when the lines are only separated by one-half a wave-length, the permis-

sible error in their position becomes, as in case of mirrors, one-eighth of a wave-length.

     The definition of a grating depends, ceeteris paribus, on its width, in the same

way that that of a telescope depends on the diameter of the object-glass. It Ls
very doubtful if any optical work hitherto produced approaches the extreme exact-
ness which one-eighth wave-length error indicates, but the above remarks show

at any rate that a very high order of accuracy is required in order to produce

effective diffraction gratings. The author proceeded to describe the principles

adopted in his machine by which this accuracy is intended to be secured.

    Most of the sketches for the machine were made during the yeai-s 1876-78. At
the close of 1878 the author made an application to the Government Grant Com-

mittee of the Royal Society for aid in the construction of the machine, and tliis

being fovourably received, "the working drawings were put in the hands of Mr

W. R. Munro, of King's Cross Road, in 1879.

     The machine was completed at the close of last year, and some good results have
been obtained by it. The chief difficulty experienced, and one which continues

to give trouble, "is of a very commonplace kind, viz., that of getting a suitable
motor, which will go for several weeks without verj- constant attention, and above
                                                                                                   TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                                                                                                                                         467

all without stopping, water power unfortunately not being available in the place

where the machine has been erected.

Up to the time when this machine was commenced, no diffraction grating had

been ruled larger than 2 inches square, and but few as large as this. The new

machine was designed to rule 6 inches square, but can if required rule 6| x 6^.

Professor Rouland's machine, which seems to have given such good results in America,
will, the author believed, rule 6" x 4''.

In describing his ruling apparatus it will be convenient to take the various

--parts in the following order :                                                                        (1) The screw and nut                                                                                                                     (2) The platform which

considered, is almost impossible to produce.

A screw in general has four kinds of errors which are easily measui-able. (1)

Eccentricity or  want of straightness                                                                   in   the                                                                                           axis                      (2)          Gradual  variation  of pitch

length as the pitch of the leading screw of the lathe in which it was cut; (4,

Awhich is perhaps the most important), periodic error which recurs at each thread.

In dividing engines, as ordinarily made, the nut is rigidly attached to the platform

which holds the object to be divided, and in this case the first and last-mentioned
errors conspire to produce a periodic irregularity in the motion of the platform

recurring at each revolution of the screw.
     If, however, the nut itself be left free to take any position which it likes, subject

only to the condition of not turning round with the screw, the efi'ect of these two

errors is to cause the axis of the nut to describe a cone about the axis of the screzv,
and the forward motion of the apex of this cone is free from the periodic error in

question.

     If, then, the nut be held in gymbals, which is in effect to hold it by a point in
its axis, and the motion of the nut be communicated to the platform through the
(n-mballing, the error depending on the pitch of the screw does not appear in the

motion of the platform.
     This plan has been carried out in the ruling machine. Fig. 2 shows a per-

spective sketch of the screw, nut, gymbals, rings, and pushing piece which connects

the nut with the sliding platform.

EThe pushing piece has a spherical projection at   which fits into a spherical

cavity in the end of the platform.
     It will be seen that if it were not for the arm F, the nut together with the push-

ing piece would be capable of turning round with the screw. This arm, whicli can
                                                                   pivot freely about the axis yy', rests on

   Pjj, 2                             a guide G, parallel to the axis of the
                                      screw, and is continually held at right

                                      angles to the screw by means of a pair

                                      of jaws, which are carried along by a

                                      screw A', of the same pitch as, and turn-

                                      ing simultaneously with, A.

                                           If the screw were perfect, the guide

                                      on whicli the ends of the arm F rest

                                      ought evidently to be a straight line, but

                                      if the errors of the pitch are known, the
                                      guide can be so shaped as to make the
                                      advance of the nut equal to what it

                                      would be if the screw were perfect and

                                      the guide straight.

If the nut is more than half as long again as the pitch of the leading screw

of the lathe, errors of the third kind will not matter.
     It was needless to state in detail the means by which the errors of the screw were

measured, but they were made with considerable care, and he did not think any

variation in pitch exceeding iuo~o ^^^^ could have escaped detection.
     The screw itself had an error of about ^^^^ inch in its length, that is to say, at

one part the threads were ^-'5^ inch distant irom the position which they should

have had, had the pitch been uniform throughout.

II. The platform on which the grating rests while being ruled is a plate of

P Pcast iron which rests on a plane,  P, at three points or rather small surfaces, and

is touched by a straight edge, S S, at two. This five-point contact ensures motion

in a straight line. It will be observed that owing to the method employed to con-

nect the nut and platform, it is not necessary that the direction of motion of the

latter should be more than approximately parallel to the axis of the screw.
    Through the platform pass three verticallj' adjustable studs, bi,b^,b^, on which

the grating rests, and from one side of the platform one, and from an adjacent side

two, cast iron ears, X,, 'K^, project, against which the sides of the grating are pressed

by screws from the sides opposite.

    III. The tool carriage, c, fig. 1, which is a very rigid girder of cast iron, is
guided much in the same Avay as the platform.

    The tool-holder itself, m, is supported on bearings 7c, k', which permit the

tool to be raised or lowered on the gratings. The tool, t, has besides independent

vertical and azimuthal adjustments in the tool-holder.
     IV. In order to rule lines at equal intervals the screw has to be turned through

a constant angle between the ruling of each line.

To effect this tlie following plan has been adopted with success.

On one end of the screw a wheel, W, six inches in diameter, with a smooth

edge, is fixed, and in the continuation of the axis of the screw behind the dead-

centre, L, the hollow axis, D, held in rigid bearings bolted on the bed of the

Nmachine, carries the iron casting, N.  contains what may be described as an

artificial hand, of which the finger and thumb, c c', when tightened, close on a

diameter of the wheel W. The end of the lever, N', is actuated, through a

connecting rod, by an adjustable crank, Q, fig. 1, and suitable mechanism removes

finger and thumb from the periphery of the wheel during one-half of the revo-

lution of the crank, and tightens them on it during the other half. This causes

the screw to turn round by a definite amount at each complete revolution of the

crank.

    He had now to mention the means employed to make this rotation independent

           Fig. 3.

of the various errors of workmanship which are sure to be present in such a con-

trivance.

In the first place, no strain on the dead-centre support of the screw should

result from the pressure of the ' hand,' nor should any slight eccentricity of the

wheel affect the amount of the rotation. This is ensured by the arrangement of

the levers which open and close the finger, shown in fig. 3. The inner end of the
Alevers, c c', terminate in front of the hollow axis, D.
                                                          rod, K, passing through

D carries a cross head, /j, capable of pivoting through a small arc about l^ in

the plane of the levers, c, c'. Links, ^ l^, connect the ends of the cross-head

Nvith those of the levers ; thus the backwards or forwards movement of the rod, R.

in the hollow axis settles the distance between the jaws of c, c', but not their

absolute lateral position, and the equality of the lengths of the levers and arms of
--470
                            BEPOBT 1882.

the cross-head ensure that the forces with which c and c' press on any object

nipped between them shall be equal.
     Thus any eccentricity of wheel will not prevent both c and c' from acting

on it, and since they both press with equal force, no strain will be exerted on the

dead-centre support, L.

DIf the axis of is absolutely coincident with that of the screw, the angle

through which the screw is turned is simply (since, when the hand closes on the

Dwheel, it practically becomes part of it) the arc through which is turned by

the motion of the crank ; but suppose the axes are not coincident, but are separated

by a distance f , having a component Ф' in the mean plane of the levers c c',

the circumferential motion of c is a{r + i'), and of c' a(r-e'), where a is the

Dangular motion given to    by the crank, and small. As both c and c' try to

impress their own motion on the rim of the wheel, slipping must occur at one or

the other, but at which, if both jaws are made alike, it would be impossible to say.

To avoid this uncertainty, c' is made a roller having its axis when closed on the

wheel parallel to that of the screw. It then becomes certain that if any slipping

Doccur from the want of coincidence in the axes of and the screw, it will

take place only at c', and the angle through which the screw is turned at each

revolution of the crank becomes a-r      E, where is the length of N',
                                  K. --

The above description touches on most of the important points in the machine,

although there still remain many details and precautions against errors of various

kinds, which, though very necessary to the working of tlie instrument, it would be

tedious to describe at length.

     The leading objects which the author had in view in making the designs, and
which he believed to be very important in all work where a high degree of

accuracy is required, were
     1. To supply the necessary and sufficient conditions only to determine the

motion of each part.

     2. To arrange that, where possible, errors of the first order in the workmanship

should only produce errors of the second order in the results.

     3. To allow the workman to concentrate his attention on the fulfilment of one
condition only to the highest degree of accuracy in each part, and that where one
or more other conditions have to be fulfilled by the same part, a lower order of
accuracy should be sufficient for them. For instance, in the guidance of the
platform which holds the gi-ating, the most important condition is that the straight
edge which guides it should be really straight, and tliis must be fulfilled with the
utmost accuracy which good workmanship can attain; it is also requisite that

the straight edge should be parallel to the axis of the screw, but this condition,
owing to the nature of the connection between the nut and the platform, need

only be satisfied approximately.

The action of the di-iving machinery can best be indicated by the diagram,

fig. 4, of the operations which it performs durmg the ruling of one line. The

variety of operations there shown necessarily make the mechanism a little

complicated, and the author would only describe that part of it which com-

municates the reciprocating motion to the tool carriage. The conditions which

the reciprocating motion must fulfil are, (1) that the force applied to the tool

carriage must be constant in direction; (2) that the velocity should be constant

during the whole time that  the   tool is cutting                                                        (3)  that there should be no shock

     As to the results obtained, the author had hitherto, on account of not having a

lines per inch, the largest which he had rided up to the present time bemg about

5| inches square, with about 2,800 lines per inch. This grating gives very fair
results, considering that it is ruled on plate glass not specially worked, but only

picked for uniformity of curvature. Occasion allj', with a favourable adjustment,
he had divided b^ with it in the fifth spectrum ; to do this the vertical aperture had

to be diminished, but not the horizontal.

    He did not know what the limit to the closeness of ruling which can be performed,

by the machine is, but it depends more on the diamond and the surface ruled on

than anything else. He had had no difficulty in ruling small areas with 100,000

lines per inch, and although he had no microscope objective which would show lines

as close as this, their presence could be detected by the blue gleam of the light

diffracted by them when held very obliquely in the sunlight.

At the rate at which he had hitherto worked the machine, viz., about 4 lines
Cper minute, it would take several weeks to rule a
                                                    grating of 20,000 lines per

inch, and in view of these long periods, during which the temperature of the

machine ought not to vary, it has been placed in a double room, one completely

enclosed within the other, and apparatus added for automatically keeping the

temperature constant.

     Self-registering thermometers which record the temperature of the machine

room and the outer air show that even when the latter varies from 15░ to 18░

Fahr., the former does not vary more than two or  three tenths                                                           a  result which he

thought may be considered very satisfactory.

He hoped, however, to be able to increase the speed of working very consider-

ably, the limit to which can of course only be found by trial.

            7. A Numerical Estimate of the Rigidity of the Earth.
                                By G. H. Daewin, F.E.S.

     About fifteen years ago Sir "William Thomson pointed out that, however it be
constituted, the body of the earth must of necessity yield to the tidal forces due ts
the attraction of the sun and moon, and he discussed the rigidity of the earth
on the hypothesis that it is an elastic body.

    If the solid earth were to yield as much as a perfect fiuid to these forces, the

tides in an ocean on its surface would necessarily be evanescent, and if the yielding
be of smaller amount, but still sensible, there must be a sensible reduction in the

height of the oceanic tides.

     Sir William Thomson appealed to the universal existence of oceanic tides of

considerable height as a proof that the earth, as a whole, possesses a high degree of
rigidity, and maintained that the previously received geological hypothesis of a

fiuid interior was untenable. At the same time he suggested that careful observa-
tion would afford a means of arriving at a numerical estimate of the average-
modulus of rigidity of the earth's mass as a whole. The semidiurnal and diurnal

tides present phenomena of such complexity, that it is quite beyond the power of
mathematics to calculate what these heights would be, if the earth's mass were
absolutely unyielding. But the tides of long period are nearly free from the
dynamical influences which render those of short period so intractable to calcidation,
and must in fact nearly follow the laws of the ' equilibrium theory.'

     In 1867 it was not, however, even definitely known whether or not the tides of
long period were of sensible height at any station. Although there has been a con-
tinual advance in the knowledge of tidal phenomena since that time, it is only

within the last year that there is a sufficient accumulation of tidal observations,^

properly reduced by harmonic analysis, to make it possible to carry out Sir William
Thomson's suggestion. The great advances in knowledge that have been recently
made are principally due to the adoption of systematic tidal observation at a great
number of stations by the Indian Government. The results of these observations
are now being issued yearly by the Secretary of State for India in the form of tide-

tables for the principal Indian ports. The author had had the pleasure of carrying
out the examination of the tidal records, and a detailed account of the work will
appear at Д 848 of the new edition of Thomson and Tait's ' Natural Philosophy,'"
now in the press.

     The tides chosen for discussion were the lunar fortnightly declinational tide,
and the lunar monthly elliptic tide. These tides must be free from the meteoro-
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.  473

logical disturbances which make the heights of all the solar tides quite beyond pre-
diction. The fortnightly and monthly tides consist in an alternate increase and
diminution of the ellipticity of the elliptic spheroid of which the sea-level (after
elimination of the tidal oscillations of short period) forms a part. There are two
parallels of latitude, respectively north and south of the equator, which are nodal
lines, along which the water neither rises nor falls. "When, in the northern hemi-

sphere, the water is highest to the north of the nodal line of evanescent tide, it is
lowest to the south of it, and vice versa ; and tlie like is true of the southern
hemisphere. If the ocean covered the whole eartli the nodal lines would be in

latitudes 35░ 16' N. and S. (at which latitudes ^ -- sin" lat. vanishes); but when

the existence of land is taken into consideration, the nodal latitudes are shifted.

Now according to Sir William Thomson's amended equilibrium theory of the tides,

the shifting of the nodal latitudes depends on a certain definite integral, whose
limits are determined by the distribution of land on the earth's surface.

     For the purpose of examining the tidal records, it was therefore first necessary to
evaluate this integral. Approximation is of course unavoidable, and for that end
the irregular contours of the continents were replaced by meridians and parallels of
latitude, and the integral evaluated by quadrature. This procedure will give
results quite accurate enough for practical purposes. It appeared as the result of
the quadrature that, if we assume the existence of a large antarctic continent, the
latitude of evanescent tide is 34░ 40', and if there is no such continent it is 34░ 57'.
Hence the displacement of the nodal latitudes due to the existence of land is very

small.

     This point having been settled, the mathematical expressions for the fortnightly
and monthly tides are completely determinate, according to the equilibrium theory,

with no yielding of the earth's mass.
     If there is yielding of the earth, either with perfect or imperfect elasticity, and

with frictional resistance to the motion of the water, the height of tide and the
time of high-water must depart from the laws assigned by the equilibrium theory.

This conclusion may also be stated in another way, which is more convenient for
practical purposes ; for we may say that at any station thei'e must actually be a

tide with a height equal to some fraction of the full equilibrium height and
with high-water exactly at the theoretical time, and a second tide, of exactly the
same nature, with a height equal to some other fi-action of the equilibrium height,
but differing in the time of high-water by a quarter-period from the theoretical

time--viz. about three-and-a-half days for the fortnightly and a week for the
monthly tide. These two tides may, according to geometrical analogy, be called

perpendicular component tides. According to the theory of the composition of

harmonic motions, the two components may be compoimded into a single tide, with

time of high-water occurring within a half-period of the theoretical time ; and this

is the way in which the results of elastic yielding and frictional resistance were first
stated above. Thus the actual tide at any station involves two unknown fractions,
.r and y, being the factors by which two components, each of the full theoretical
height, are to be multiplied in order to give the two components in proper amount

to represent the reality.

      If the equilibrium theory is fidfilled without sensible elastic yielding of the
earth, the first component has its full value, or .r is equal to one, and the second
component vanishes, or y is zero. If fluid friction exercises a sensible influence, y
will have a sensible value ; and if the solid earth yields tidally, .v will be less than
unity. The amount of elastic yielding, and hence the average modulus of elasticity

of the whole earth may be computed from the value of a: After rejecting the ob-
servations made at certain stations for suflicient reasons, the author obtained from

the Tidal Reports of the British Association and from the Indian Tide Tables, the

results of thirty-three years of observation, made at fourteen diflferent ports in

England, France, and India.

    These results, when properly reduced, gave thirty-three equations for the .r and

thirty-three for the y of the fortnightly tide, and similarly thirty-three for the .r
and thirty-three for the y of the monthly tide; in all 132 equations for four
unknowns.
--474
KEPORT 1882.

     The X and y of the two classes of tide were in the first instance regarded as
distinct, but the manner in which they arise shows that it is legitimate to regard
them as identical, and thus we have sixty-six equations for x and sixty-six for y.

     The equations were then reduced by the method of least squares, with the

following results :

And for the monthly tide

     The numbers given with alternative signs are the probable errors. _
     The very close agreement between the x and y for the two tides is probably

somewhat due to chance.
     The smallness of the two p's is satisfactory; for, as above stated, it the

mequilibrium theory were true, they should vanish. Moreover, the signs are

agreement with what they should be, if friction is a sensible cause of tidal
retardation. But considering the magnitude of the probable errors, it is of course
more likely that the non-evanescence of the y's is due to errors of observation
or to the method of reduction.

     The author had already submitted to the British Association at this meetmg a
paper on a misprint, discovered by Professor Adams, in the Tidal Report for 1872.
This report forms the basis of the method of harmonic analysis which has been
employed in the reduction of the tidal observations, and it appears that the
erroneous formula has been systematically used. The large probable error in the
value of the monthly tide may most probably be reduced by a correct treatment

of the original tidal records.
      It has been already remarked that it is legitimate to combine all the observa-

tions together, for both sorts of tide, and thus to obtain a single x and y from

sixty-six years of observation. Carrying out this idea he found :

                                  X = -676 + -076, y = -029 + -065.

     These results really seem to present evidence of a tidal yielding of the earth's
mass, and the value of the x is such as to show that the effective rigidity of the

whole earth is about equal to that of steel.

   --But this residt is open to some doubt for the following reason :

     Taking only the Indian results (forty-eight years in all), which are much more

consistent than the English ones, he fomid

                                    X = -9.31 + -056, y = -loo + -068.

    We thus see that the more consistent observations seem to bring out the tides

more nearly to their theoretical equilibrium values with no elastic yielding of the

 solid.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ..
      It is to be observed however that the Indian results being confined ^ylthln a

narrow range of latitude give (especially when we consider the absence of minute

 accuracy in his evaluation of the definite integral) a less searching test lor the
elastic yielding than a combination of results from all latitudes.

     On the whole we may faii-ly conclude that, whilst there is some evidence of a

tidal yielding of the earth's mass, that yielding is certainly smaU, and that the

 effective rigidity is at least as great as that of steel.

    The following Papers were read :

1. On a Method of investigating experimentally the Absorption of Radiant
    Heat by Gases. By Professor Tait, Sec. B.8.E. (From a letter to
    SirW. Thomson).

     There are grave objections, which have been only partially overcome, to almost

iill the processes hitherto employed for testing the diathermancy of vapoui-s. These

arise chiefly from condensation on some part of the apparatus. Thus when rock-
salt is used, an absorbent surface-layer may be formed ; and, when the pile is used
without a plate of salt, the effect of radiant heat may be to cool it (the pile) by

the evaporation of such a surface-film.

    Some time ago it occurred to me that this part of the difficidty might be got rid

of by dispensing with the pile, and measuring the amount of absorption by its

effects on the volume and pressure of the gas or vapour itself.

    Only preliminary trials have as yet been made. They were carried out for me

by Professor MacGregor and Mr. Lindsay. Their object _was,7??-sf, to find whether
the method would work well ; second (when this was satisfactorily proved), to find

the best form and dimensions for the apparatus.

The rough apparatus is merely a double cylinder, placed vertically. Cold water

circulates iu the jacket surrounding the curved surface and

bottom, and steam can be blowni into the double top. The =                                        STEAM

changes in the pressure of the gas are shown by a manometer =

U-tube at the bottom, which contains a liquid which will not

attack the contents.

     This apparatus was foiu- feet long, with two inches' radius.
The results of a number of experiments show that it shoidd be
shorter and much wider. The former idea I was not quite

prepared for ; the latter is obvious.

     The effects on the manometer are due to five chief

causes:                                                                                        =

1. Heating of the upper layer of gas by contact with lid.

2. Cooling of the upper layer of gas by contact with sides.

?>. Heating of more or less of the column by aljsorption.

4. Cooling of more or less of the column by radiation.

.5. Cooling of more or less of the coliuun by contact.

1 and 2 only are present in a perfectly diathermanous

gas,  as  well as in a perfectly adiathermanous gas  or  vapour
                                                                                            ;

all five take place simultaneously in a partially diathermanous gas or vapour.

The preliminary experiments show that the manometer efi'ect is only very slifiltthj

less for dry defiant gas than for dry air, while moist air shows a markedly smaller

efiect than either of the others.
     This is conclusive as to the absorption of low radiant heat by aqueous vapour,

but it shows also that the absorption is so small as to take place tln-oughout the

whole colvmin.

     Even with the present rude apparatus I hope soon to get a very accurate de-
termination of the absorbing power of aqueoiis vapour, by finding in what pro-
portions olefiant gas must be mixed with dry air to form an absorbing medium

equivalent to saturated air at diflerent temperatures.
     I have to acknowledge valuable hints from Professor Stokes, wlio, before I told

him the results I had obtained (thus knowing merely the nature of the experiments),
made something much higher than a guess, though somewhat short of a prediction,

of the truth.

     In these preliminary trials no precaution was taken to exclude dud. The results,

therefore, are still hable to a certain amount of doubt, as Mr. Aitken's beautiful

experiments have shown.
    The point of the method is that there can be no question of surfoce-layers, pro-

vided the operation be carried on long enough.

3. On the Alteration in the Dimensions of the Magnetic Metals by the Act of
           Magnetisation. By Professor W. F. Barrett, F.B.S.E.

    In 1842 Dr. Joule discovered that when a bar of iron was magnetised by an

electric current an elongation of the bar took place. In subsequent experiments,

published in 1847, Joule found that the elongation amounted to about ijjj^th of

the length of the bar for the maximum magnetisation, and that the total elongation
was nearly proportional to the square of the actual magnetisation. By placing the

bar in a vessel of water stopped with a capillary tube it was found that the volume
of the iron did not augment, and hence Joule concluded that the sectional area
diminished in proportion to the elongation. Under longitudinal tension magnetisa-
tion caused a shortening of the rod when the tension exceeded 600 lbs. for a rod
a quarter of an inch square. Soft steel behaved like iron ; but hard steel, under
all circumstances, Joule found to shorten slightly when the magnetising current

passed.

     In 1873 Professor Mayer repeated Joule's experiments with new and delicate

apparatus ; the elongation of the iron he found to amount to ^.-'^ of its length for

the maximum magnetization. Mayer also found that soft as well as hard steel

contracted under magnetisation.

     In the same year the author made a series of experiments on the other magnetic
metals, nickel and cobalt, and found that whilst cobalt lengthened under magneti-
sation, nickel appeared to suffer no change.'^ This result is surprising, for nickel
more nearly resembles iron and cobalt than steel in magnetic properties, the former
having little coercive force and the latter very considerable retentive power. With
entirely new apparatus the experiments were repeated and a distinct shortening of
the nickel was now found, cobalt elongating, but not so much as iron. The multi-
plying apparatus that was found to yield most satisfactoi-y results was a simple
form of optical lever, a mirror vertically fixed over the fulcrum of a lever of the
first order and reflecting a scale at some distance into an observing telescope. The
apparatus will be more fully described in the report that will be presented next
year, a committee, with a small money grant, having been appointed at a previous
meeting of the Association to investigate this and certain other molecular changes
accompanying the magnetisation of iron described by the author at the Bradford
meeting of the Association.

  --The results so far obtained may be summed iip as follows : However often the

current traverses the helix aromid the bar of cobalt, the elongation is practically
the same after the first current, and amounts to about two-thirds of the elongation

produced in an iron bar of the same dimensions. In my measurements the elonga-
tion of the iron amounted to about ,-;^~, of its length for the maximum magnetisa-

tion ; the iron elongated 55 scale-divisions and the cobalt 35.

     With nickel, after the first magnetising current is passed the retraction i╗
practically the same for succeeding currents ; with the same scale the nickel retracted

100 divisions, or about double the elongation of iron.
      Enclosing the bars in a vessel of water with a capillary tube, having a helix

encircling the vessel, no motion of the index was noticed on magnetising the cobalt
and the iron, but a slight fall of the index, indicating a diminution of volume, was
noticed with nickel. The experiments, however, were somewhat rough, and will
shortly be repeated with greater care.

     The ' magnetic tick ' is heard loudly with cobalt and nickel, as well as iron, the
former giving a very clear metallic click on magnetisation.

     The author is much indebted to the kindness of Messrs. Johnson and Mattliey for
the bars of nickel and cobalt (9^ inches long and 1 inch diameter) with which the

bar of nickel. Experiments are now in progress to determine the eilect of tempe-

ratures and longitudinal tension on the results.*

6. On a Mechanical Self-registering Thermometer. By A. Mallock.

    Having recently had occasion to keep a room at a constant temperature for
many days together, the author had, in order to test the efficiency of the apparatus
employed for that purpose, to have some means of continuously recording the
temperature of the room and also of the external air.

Several causes prevented the use of the ordinary photographic method, and he

therefore designed the mechanical recording thermometer which is the subject of

this communication ; and since there are obvious advantages in dispensing with

photography if equally accurate results can be obtained by a simple mechanical

means, and as the same principles can be applied to the construction of a me-

chanical self-recording barometer, he hopes the short description of his apparatus,

which will be given here, may not be without some use.

The thermometer consists of a long glass bidb (A) holding about half a pint of

spirits of wine. This bulb is connected by a fine metallic tube (B), also full of spirit,

with a small bulb (C) near the recording apparatus.  is half-full of mercury

and half of spirit, and terminates in a capillary tube (D), which dips into a deep

cup (E), which also contains mercury. This cup is suspended from a horizontal
lever (F), and its weight, without the mercury, coimterbalanced.

     The weight of the mercury in the cup is talreu by the spiral spring (G).
     The upright arm (H), attached to the lever, carries the pen-rod (K), which
marks on the horizontal cylinder (L).
     The cylinder turns round once a week, and time is marked on the paper at
intervals of three hours by a pen (M) actuated by an electro-magnet through
which currents are sent at the desired intervals by a contact-maker on the clock.
     The effect of a change of temperatui-e is to expel or suck mercury from or into
the small bulb, and the variation of weight on the spiral spring is'the same as it
would have been had the large bulbs been filled with mercury, and mercury had

the coefficient of expansion of spirits of wine.

     The cup (E) must be so shaped that the end of the caplllaiy tube (D) never

emerges from the surface of the mercury in the cup, and that this may be the case the

descent of the cup due to the introduction of a given quantity of mercury should
not be greater than the height which the mercury introduced occupies in the cup
or, in symbols, if o- is the area of the cup, I the unstretched length of the spiral
spring, and a the volume of mercury required at (D) to stretch it to double its natiu-al

length,

then  =o- 77 <^-y

     It will be seen that, by taking a properly proportioned spring and cup, the

thermometer may be made to record to any desired scale ; but the limit to the

accuracy of the record is of course fixed (for any given thermometer) by the

constant fi-iction of the moving parts. This, however, can without trouble be made

very small.

     To apply the mechanical method to the barometer it is only necessary to hang

the barometer tube to the lever (F) instead of the cup (E), allowing the open end
to dip into a deep fixed cistern.

     The greatest part of the weight of the merciu-y in the tube should of course be
counterbalanced, leaving only the variable part to be taken by the spring. The
variation of the barometer alters the extension of the spring by a quantity directly
proportional to the variation of the weight of the column of mercury supported

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

thus the curve drawn by this Idnd of self-recording barometer requires no correc-
tion for temperature, except a small term depending on the expansion of the glass.
The rise or fall of the tube in the mercury cistern gives rise to a force depending
on tlie flotation of the immersed part of the glass tube ; but as this force is a linear
function of the rise or fall, it makes no difference in the character of the curve
traced Ijy the instrument, and is equivalent merely to an alteration of the value of
(a) which measures the stifthess of the spring.

   --President of the Section Professor G. D, Liveing, M.A., F.R.S., F.C.S.

                             THURSDAY, AUGUST ii.

   The President delivered the following Address :

   If I -were asked in what direction chemical science had of late been making the
   most important advances, I should reply that it was in the attempt to place the
   d-^niamics of chemistry on a satisfactory basis, to render an account of the various
   phenomena of chemical action on the same mechanical principles as are acknow-

   ledged to be true in other branches of physics. I cannot say that chemistry can

   yet be reckoned amongst what are called the exact sciences, that the result pf
   brino-ino- together given matters imder given circvmistances can yet be deduced in

   more than a few special cases by mere mathematical processes from mechanical
   principles, but that some noteworthy advances have in recent years been made,
   which seem to bring such a solution of chemical problems more nearly within our

   rOticli.

       To show how large a gap in our ideas of chemical dynamics has been bridged

   over within the last quarter of a centm-y, I will quote the words of one of the

   laro-est-minded philosophers of his time, who was one of the earliest promoters of
   this Association, and its President in 1841 : Whewell, in a new and much altered

   edition of his 'Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences,' published in 1858, says:

   ' Since Newton's time the use of the word attraction, as expressing the cause of

   the imion of the chemical elements of bodies, has been familiarly continued, and has

   no doubt been accompanied ui the minds of many persons with an obscure notion that

   chemical attraction is in some way a kind of mechanical attraction of the particles

   of bodies. Yet the doctrine that chemical 'attraction' and mechanical attraction are
   forces of the same kind has never, so far as I am aware, been worked out into a

   system of chemical theory ; nor even applied with any distinctness as an explana-
   tion of any particular chemical phenomena. Any such attempt, indeed, could only
   tend to bring more clearly into Aiew the entire inadequacy of such a mode of

   explanation. For the leading phenomena of chemistry are all of such a natiu-e,
   that no mechanical combination can serve to express them without an immense

   accumulation of additional hypotheses.' (' History of Scientific Ideas,' ii. 13.) And
   Wefurther on he says:--'
                             must consider the power which produces chemical com-

   bination as a peculiar principle, a special relation of the elements not rightly ex-

   pressed in mathematical terms.' (Ibid. p. 14.)

        The influence by which our ideas have gone round so as to be now the very

   opposite of those of the illustrious thinker whom I have just quoted, so that we

   should ridicule the thought of looking for an explanation of chemical action on

   many but mechanical principles, is undoubtedly the progress which has been made

   other branches of molecular physics. The iudestructibihty of matter has long
   been a formida familiar to chemists, but that the conservation of energy should be
   as imiversally true, even in regard to chemical actions, has only in recent years been
   fully reco"-nised. This is certainlv no new principle, it was developed mathemati-
   cally generations ago ; but the reaUsation that it is anything more than an abstrac-
   tion, that it is the keynote of every rational explanation of physical phenomena,
   has been the foimdation of recent progress in physical science ; and if all energy be
   one there can be but one code of dynamical laws, which must apply to chemistry
   as well as to all other branches of physics. The development of the mechanical

1
480 EEPORX-- 1882.

theory of heat, and of the molecular theories which have grown up in consequence
of it, have done much to set our minds free from preconceived notions, and to

induce us to huild chemical theories on something more than luiverified con-

jectures.

But how far can we say that mechanical principles are actually recognised as

the true basis of rational chemistry ? So far as I know no chemist denies that it is

so, and yet how little do our text-books, even the most recent and the most highly

Howreputed, show the predominance of this idea !                                  very small a portion of such

books is taken up with it, how much seems utterly to ignore it or to be couched in

Welanguage antagonistic to it !                                                   still find chemical combinations described as if

they were statical phenomena, and expressions used which imply that two perfectly

elastic bodies can, by their mutual action alone, bring each other into fixed relative

Wepositions.                                                  still find change of valency described as a suppression of ' bonds

of affinity,' as if a suppression of forces were the usual course of nature, or as if it

were possible that the same two forces, acting at the same place and in the same

direction, should at one time neutralise one another, and at another time not

Weneutralise one another.                                     still find saturated compounds spoken of as if the

stability of a compoimd were independent of circumstances, and chemical combina-

tion no function of temperature and pressure. Beginners are sometimes helped by

the invention of intermediate reactions in explanation of final residts, without any

reference to the dynamical conditions of the problem, without any consideration

whether the fancied intermediate reactions imply a winding-up or a runniug-dowu

of energy. In fact our long familiar chemical equations represent only the conser-

vation of matter, and to keep always in mind the mechanical conditions of a

reaction is as difficult to some of us as it is to think in a foreign language. More-

over, we still find in many of our text-books the old statical notion of chemical

combination stereotyped in pictures of molecules. I do not, of course, mean to

accuse the distinguished inventors of graphic formidee of meaning to depict mole-

cules, for I believe that they would agree with me in thinking that these diagrams

do not any more nearly represent actual molecides than they represent the solar

system ; but unfortunately we cannot prevent beginners from regarding them as
pictures, and moulding their ideas upon them. They present something easily

grasped by the infant mind, and schoolmasters are fond of them ; but only those

who have each year to combat a fresh crop of misconceptions, and false mechanical
notions engendered by them, can be aware how much they hinder, I won't say the

advance, but the spread of real chemical science. If it be true that the illustrations

of an artist like the late Hablot Browne give to our conceptions of the characters

of a story a more definite and permanent, though perhaps a much modified form of

what the author of the story intended to portray, it is equally true that the illus-

trations by which some, even great names amongst us, have tried to make us fancy

that we had a true conception of some natural process, have become so fixed in our

minds as to prevent our realising the true meaning of nature.

     What, then, is the progress which I think has been made in physical chemistry ?
In the first place, notwithstanding the slowness with which new ideas replace old

familiar images, the molecular theories developed by Clausius, Clerk Maxwell, and

Boltzmann, and by Sir W. Thomson, have been long enough before the world to

have greatly loosened the hold upon our minds of many old notions. The rigid,

unbreakable, impenetrable atoms of the Epicurean philosophy, made familiar to us

by Lucretius, always presented difficulties whicli were only perhaps exceeded by

those of the elastic atmospheres with which modern philosophers fimcied them to

be surrounded                                                 but now the vortex  theory, whether we  think  it  probable  or not,
                                                           ;

at least gives us a standing ground for the assertion that the supposed impenetra-

bility of matter, and the curious compound of nucleus and atmosphere which had

been invented to account for elasticity, are not necessary assumptions.

The kinetic theory of gases has analysed for us the different motions of the

molecules in a mass of matter, and has facilitated the conception of the part which

beat plays in chemical action. Hence we have had of late several attempts to

reduce to a form susceptible of mathematical calculation the problems of chemistry.

Most of these attempts have proceeded on the well-known mechanical principle
       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                                481

that the change of vis vioa of a system, in passing from an initial to a final configura-

tion, is independent of the intermediate stages through which it may have passed

Srovided the external conditions are unaltered ; and on the principle of the
  issipation of energy, that is to say, on the condition that the state of the system,

if it be a stable one, must be such that the energy run down in reaching it is a

maximum. These principles have been applied successfully to the solution of some

particular cases of the equilibrium between a mixture of chemicals by Willard

Gibbs, Berthelot, and others. By the first-mentioned principle all consideration of

the intermediate stages by which the final residt is reached is avoided. Quite

recently Lemoinne has attacked the same problem on another principle. His

principle is that of an equilibrium of antagonistic reactions in a mixture of

materials, a mobile equilibrium, such as we are now familiar with, dependent on

compensating effects и, but he does not seem able to solve the problem in any great

number of cases. In fact, the difficulty does not now lie so much in expressing

mathematically the conditions of the problem, as in the defect of knowledge which

depends upon experiment. And it is just in this that I think the outlook most

hopeful. In some cases the patient work of weighing, measuring, and comparing,

which is necessary to make our theoretic speculations of any substantial value, has

been already done for us. The publication, three years since, of Berthelot 's ' Essay

on Chemical Mechanics,' has given us, in a collected form, a large quantity of data

of the first importance, and now I am glad to say that the long labours of another

worker in the same field, Thomsen of Copenhagen, are in course of publication in a

handy form. I think these two investigators have done more than anyone else of

late years towards making it possible to give chemistry the rank of an exact science.

But besides the data which they have supplied to us, there are others which are

yet wanting. For instance, almost every equation of chemical equilibrium involves

an expression depending on the specific heat of the materials. At present we do

not know enough of the law of specific heats to be able to give in most cases a

probable value to these expressions, but these and other data of the kind do not

seem out of our reach, and we may hope that the same ingenuity and patience

which have gained for us so much firm ground in thermal chemistry will extend it to

the imcertain spots where we have as yet no solid foundation.

     Further, the laws of dissociation, so ably investigated by Deville, have taught
us that the force called chemical affinity, by which we suppose the atoms of unlike

matters are held together in a compound molecule, follows precisely the same laws

as the force of cohesion by which particles of a similar kind are iniited in molecides.

We have long known that the molecules of sidphur vapour are broken up into simpler

molecules by elevation of temperature, and condense again when the temperature is

Wereduced. Other elementary substances behave in a similar way.  have within the

last two or three years learnt that iodine is in part dissociated by a high temperature

from molecules consisting of two chemical atoms into molecides consisting of

only one such atom, and the same is true of chlorine and bromine. That some such

change must occur in iodine was inferred as long ago as 1804 by the younger

Mitscherlich. He argued that iodine is a compound body from the fact that it

shows two spectra, one similar in character to tliose of metallic oxides and the

other similar to the spectra of metals, and from the analogy in the behaviour of

iodine to a metallic oxide in giving the one spectrum at one temperature and the other

at a higher temperature : ' from this,' he says, ' it would follow that iodine at ordinary
temperatures and iodine at the temperature of a hydrogen flame must be considered

as two different compounds, because the spectrimi of iodine formed at ordinary

temperatures ' (that is, the absorption spectrum of iodine vapour) ' is different from

that produced in a hydrogen flame.' Also ' that bromine, though it gives no flame

spectrum, gives one spectrum by absorption and another by the electric spark, and

must therefore in its ordinary state be regarded as a compomid.' Also that ' the

spectra formed by the flames of seleniiun, tellurium, and phosphorus, and those of

sulphur and nitrogen given by feeble electric discharges, all have the character of

the iodine flame spectrum, and these metalloids would therefore, if the above ex-

pressed supposition with regard to iodine be confirmed, also be compound bodies.'

taken was published, not only the metalloids but many metals have been fomid
to give complicated spectra at one temperature and much simpler spectra at

higher temperatures. Such are the channelled spectra of sodium and potas-

sium, first descrilsed by Roscoe and Sclmster, the channelled spectra of silver,
bismuth, and other metals described by Lockyer and Roberts, and the ultra-violet
channelled spectrum of tin recently photographed by Dewar and myself,

Mitscherlich's hypothesis gives us a rational explanation of such multiple spectra

produced hj the same substance, and it has Ijeen accepted, in one form or another,

by all spectroscopists since he wrote. Nevertheless, the existence of multiple

spectra cannot be taken as a proof of allotropic modification imless the possibility

of a chemical combination be excluded. The channelled spectrmn which mag-

nesium gives in hydrogen was mistaken by more than one observer for that of
some modification of the simple metal, until it was shown that magnesium in

nitrogen or other gases does not give it if no hydrogen is present, and that its per-

sistence in hydrogen at high temperatures depends, as does the permanence of

chemical combinations, on the pressure of the gas. If, however, homogeneous mole-

cules are dissociated by heat, so also are heterogeneous molecules, formed, as we say,
by chemical combination, split up by elevation of temperature, to unite again on

cooling, or when the pressure is increased within certain limits. Nor is there any

essential difference in character between a chemical compound and an element be-
yond that of facility of decomposition. If we could not so easily resolve them into

their constituents, and were to disregard the difierence of their spectra, no one-

would suppose ammonia to be differently constituted from potassiimi, or cyanogen

from chlorine. Indeed, chemists have long been in the habit of considering the

imion of two atoms in a molecule of ordinary hydrogen or chlorine as a species of

chemical combination ; but when we find that the combinations of particles of the

same kind are as definite as those of particles of different kinds, and that they

are both subject to precisely the same mechanical laws, we are hardly justified

in regarding the forces by which they are produced as essentially difl'erent. To get

rid of a gratuitous hypothesis in chemistry must be a great gain.

WhyBut it may be asked, why stop here ?  may not the chemical elements-

Abe further broken up by still higher temperatures ?  priori and from analogy

such a supposition is extremely probable. The notion that there is but one ele-

mentary kind of matter is at least as old as Thales, and underlies Front's hypothesis

that the atomic weights of om* elements are all multiples of that of hydrogen.

This famous hypothesis has gone up and down in the scale of credibility many

times during the present century. About seventeen years ago the publication of

Stas' new determinations of combining weights, carried out on a scale never before

attempted, and with all the refinements which the growth of our knowledge could

suggest, was thought to have given it its death-blow. But a reaction has set in

since that time. The periodic recurrence of the properties of elements with regular

additions to the atomic weights, like octaves in a musical scale, put forcibly before

us by Mendelejeff, makes it diflicidt not to think that there is a simple relation

between the atomic weights, though there may be causes producing slight perturba-

tions of such a relation. Quite recently a fresh revision of the combining weights

has been made on the other side of the Atlantic by Professor F. W. Clarke. Pie has

collected all the determinations made by different observers, and after rejecting such

as from defective methods were imtrustworthy, has applied to the remainder such

corrections as newer experiences have suggested, and then deduced from the cor-

rected nimibers the most probable values by the methods of the theory of errors.

Professor Clarke has done a piece of work of the highest utility, for which chemists

must be grate fid ; nevertheless, he has not carried the revision so far as it might be

carried. He has, to begin with, rightly separated the several sets of observations,

and deduced the most probable nimiber from each set by itself, but in combining

the various sets for the final determination of the numbers adopted, he has treated

the residts obtainfid by different methods as if they were a set of observations all

presumably of equal value, so that the most probable numbers could be deduced

by the method of least squares. He has not attempted any discussion of the diffe-

rent methods with a view to an estimate of the relative values of the results
TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                                       483

obtained by tliem, nor made any difference between the values of the figures

deduced from operations on the large scale employed by Stas and those arrived at

on the small scale of other observers. Any sort of handicapping of methods is

no doubt a very difficult and delicate operation, and requires more than the judg-

ment of an Admiral Rous, but -without it the question whether the numbers

adopted are the best obtainable will always be an open one. It is, however, a

very noteworthy fact, that in almost every case the numbers deduced from fStas'

experiments, taken by themselves, coincide very closely indeed with the most pro-

bable numbers derived by the method of least squares from the whole of the re-

corded estimates. On the whole, Professor Clarke concludes that Front's hypothesis,

as modified by Dumas, is still an open question, that is to say, his final numbers

differ from whole multiples of a common imit by quantities which lie within the

limits of errors of observation and experunent.

Let us tm-n again to the evidence aflbrded by our most powerfiU' instrument for

Ainspecting the inner constitution of matter, the spectroscope.  few years ago

Mr. Lockyer supposed that the coincidence of rays emitted by ditierent chemical

elements, particidarly when those rays were developed in the spark of a powerfid

induction coil and in the high temperatures of the sun and stars, gave evidence of

a common element in the composition of the metals which produced the coincident

rays. Such an argiunent could not be drawn from the coincidences imless they

were exact, and the identity of the lines could only be tested by means of spectro-

scopes of great resolving power. By the use of the well-known Rutherford gratings,

Yoimg in America had fomid that most of the solar lines which had been ascribed

to two metals were in reality double, and Dewar and I, worldng on the terrestrial

elements in the electric arc, had found the actual coincidences to be verj- few

indeed. These observations, even with Rutherford gratings, were delicate enough

but quite recently M. Fievez, of the Brussels Observatory, has brought to bear on

this question a spectroscope of unexampled power. By combining two of the

Astronomer Royal's highly dispersive half-prisms with a Rutherford gratmg

--of 17,296 lines to the inch, he has obtained a dispersion quadruple that of

Thollon's combination of prisms. Bringing this to bear on the smi he has mapped

the solar spectriun from a little below C to somewhere above F, on a scale one-

third greater than that of Vogel's map, and has not only confirmed the work of

Yomig, Dewar, and myself, but has resolved some lines which were not divisible by

such dispersive power as we had at command. This result cannot fail to shake our

belief, if we have any, in the existence of any common constituent of the chemical

elements ; but it does not touch the e-sidence which the spectroscope afibrds us,

that many of our elements, in the state in which we know them, must have a very

complex molecular structure. I cannot illustrate this point better than by the
Wespectra of two of our commonest elements, magnesium and iron.
                                                                 have good

reason to think the molecule of magnesium to be as simple as that of any chemical

element, and we find its spectriun to be one of the simplest, consisting of a series of

triplets which repeat each other in a regular way and are probably harmonically

related, and of a comparatively small nmuber of single lines, of which also some

may be harmonics. The spectriun of iron, on the other hand, presents thousands of

lines distributed irregularly through the whole length, not only of the visible, but

of the idtra-violet region. Make what allowance you please for unknowii harmonic
relations, and for lines which are not reversible and may not be directly due to

vibrations of the molecules, we still have a number of vibrations so immense that

we can hardly conceive any single molecule to be capable of all of them, and are
almost driven to ascribe them to a mixture of differing molecules, though we have

as yet no independent evidence of this, and no satisfactory proof that any of this

mixture are of the same Mud as occur in other elements.

M. Fievez's combination is a great advance in resolving power, but Professor

Rowland, of the John Hopkins University, promises us gratings not only exceeding

Rutherford's both in dimensions and accuracy of ruling, but ruled upon curved

surfaces so as to dispense with the use of telescopes and avoid all variations in

focussing the different orders of spectra. His instruments, if they come up to the

Ii2
484 EEPORT-- 1882.

promise he holds out, will enable iis to solve many questions wliich are difficult to

answer with our present appliances.

But to return to the chemical elements : the spectroscope has in the last few

years revealed to us several new metals. I will not venture to say how many, for

when several new metals more or less closelj' allied are discovered at the same time,

Wethe process of sifting out their differences is necessarily a slow one.  cannot

tell yet whether any of them are to fill gaps in Mendelejefl"'s table, .and so add

strength to the conviction that there is a natural relation between the atomic

weights and the chemical characters of our elementary substances, or whether they

will add to the embarrassment in which we already find ourselves with regard to
the relations of the cerium group of metals ; whether we may welcome them as the

supporters of order, or deprecate their coming as authors of confusion. Granting

that the cliemical characters of an element are connected with its atomic weight,

we ha^e, however, no right to assume them to be dependent on that factor alone.

Why may there not be elements which, while they differ as little in atomic weight

as do nickel and cobalt, are, on the other hand, so similar to one another in all

characters that their chemical separation is a matter of the greatest difficulty, and

their difference only distinguishable by the spectroscope ? The spectra may be
thought to suggest so much, and how shall we decide the question ? At any

rate the complications of the spectroscopic problem can only be unravelled by

the united efforts of the chemists and physicists, and by the exercise of extreme

caution.

I cannot dismiss the subject of chemical dynamics without alluding to the in-

genious theory by which the President of the Association has proposed to accoimt

for the conservation of solar energy. He supposes planetary space to be pervaded

by an atmosphere which, except where it is condensed by the attraction of the sun

and planets, is in a highly attenuated state. The sun and planets communicate
some of their own motion of rotation to the atmosphere condensed about them, and

he supposes that in this way an action like that of a blowing fan is set up, by which

the equatorial part of the sun's atmosphere acquires such a velocity as to stream

out to distances beyond the earth's orbit, while an equal quantity of gas is drawn in

at the poles to maintain equilil)rium. The gases thus driven to a distance in planet-

ary space will of course be enormously expanded and higlily attenuated, and in

this state Dr. Siemens thinks that such of them as are compound may be decomposed

by absorbing the solar radiation, and thus the kinetic energy of tlie sun's rays be

converted into the potential energy of chemical separation. The separated elements,

or partial compounds, will in the circulation produced by the fanlike action of the

solar rotation be carried back to the polar regions of the sun as fuel to maintain

his temperature by condensation and re-combination. I will not discuss the me-

chanical part of this theory further than to remarlc that the faulike action can

only be carried on at the expense of the energy of the sun's rotation, which

must in consequence be continually diminishing, and must in time become too

slow to produce any sensible projection of the atmosphere into distant regions

of planetary space. As to the chemical side of the theory, Dr. Siemens supposes

the gases which pervade the planetary space to be not only of the same kind as

the components of our own atmosphere, which on the kinetic theory of gases

must diffuse through that space, but also such gases as are not found in our air,

but are found occluded in meteorites, which may be supposed to have acquired

them in their previous wanderings. Amongst these he specially mentions hydro-

carbons which form the self-luminous part of most comets. It is to these gases,

together with aqueous vapour and carbonic acid, that he ascribes the principal part

in the conservation of solar energy. That compound gases at the extremely low

pressure of the planetary space are decomposed by solar radiation is not inconsistent

with the laws of dissociation, for it is quite possible that some compounds may be

decomposed at ordinary temperatures by mere reduction of pressure, and the radia-

tion absorbed will be the more effective because it will directly affect the vibratory

motion within the molecule, and may well produce chemical decomposition before
it can, when the free path of the molecules is so much increased by the attenuation

of the gas, assume the form of an increased temperatui'e. Dr.Siemens, moreover,
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                                               485

Weadduces) a remarkable experiment in confirmation of this supposition.  know,

too, the power which our atmosphere, and especially the water vapour in it, has of

absorbing the infra-red rays, and that amongst the Fraunhofer lines some of the

strongest groups are due to aqueous vapour ; and the capital observation made

by the spectroscopic observers at the last total eclipse, that the group of lines known

as ' B,' which is one of those produced by aqueous vapour, is greatly strengthened

when the sun's light passes by the edge of the moon and so through the lunar
atmosphere, may be taken as a confirmation of the theory that gases like our atmo-

sphere are difi'used through space and concentrated about the planets. But if it

be true that the compounds are decomposed by absorbing the sun's rays, we ought

to find in our atmosphere the products of decomposition, we ought to find in it Iree

hydrogen, carbonic oxide, and acetylene or some other hydrocarbons. The hydro-

gen, from its small specific gravity, would not be concentrated in the lower regions

of our atmosphere in the same proportions as the denser gases, but carbonic oxide

and hydrocarbons could not fail to be detected in the air if they formed any sen-

sible proportion of the gases in the planetary space. That a large portion of solar

radiation is intercepted before it reaches the earth is no doubt true, for there are

not only tlie dark bands which are increased by our atmosphere and may reasonably

be attributed to the action of like gases pervading planetary space, but there is a

continuous absorption of the ultra-violet spectrum beyond tlie line U, and Cornu

has found that this absorption is not sensibly aff'ected by our atmosphere, so that

the substance, whatever it be that produces it, may be an agent in the process

imagined by Dr. Siemens, but cannot be the means of restoring to the sun any por-

tion of his radiant energy which reaches our distance from him.

Dr. Siemens explains the self-luminous character of comets by the theory that

the streams of meteoric stones of which tliey are supposed to consist bring from

stellar space hydrocarbon and other gases occluded within them, and that in con-

sequence of the rise of temperature due to the frictional resistance of such a divided

mass moving with enormous velocity, aided by attractive condensation, the occluded

gases will be driven out and burnt, the flame giving rise to the original light emitted

by the nucleus. Now the spectrum of most comets shows only the principal bands

of a Bunsen burner, and is therefore adequately explained bj' the flame of gas con-

taining hydrocarbons such as have been found in meteorites; but Dr. Huggins has

observed in the spectrum of more than one comet, not only hydrocarbon, but cyano-

gen bands ; and, although carbon and nitrogen combine readily in the electric arc,

a coal-gas flame in air shows no trace of the spectrum of cyanogen, and it would

certainly put some strain on our credulity if it were asserted that cyanogen was one

of the gases brought ready-formed by meteorites from stellar space. Dewar and I

have, however, recently shown that if nitrogen already in combination, as, for

instance, ammonia, be brought into a hydrocarbon flame, cyanogen is produced in
sufficient amount to give in a photograph (though not so as to be directly visible) the

characteristic spectrum of cyanogen as it appears in the comet. It is therefore no

longer necessary to make any other supposition to account for the cyanogen bands in

the spectra of comets, than that ammonia, or some such compound of nitrogen, is

present as well as hydrocarbons in a state of ignition.

Quite recently Dr. Huggins has observed that the principal comet of this year

has a spectrum of an entirely difi'erent character, but he is not yet able to say to

what elements or compounds it is probably due. The notion that comets may bring

us news of distant parts of stellar space, towards which our system is driving, where

-- --the atmosphere is not like ours oxygen and nitrogen but hydrogen and hydro-

carbons, may fascinate the fancy, but the laws of occlusion oblige us to think that

the meteorites have not merely wandered through an attenuated atmosphere of

hydrogen and hydrocarbons, but have cooled in a much denser atmosphere of those
substances, which we can only conceive as concentrated by the presence of a star

or some large aggregation of matter. They may, perchance, have come from some

nebulous mass, for Draper and Huggins tell us that in the great nebula in Orion

hydrogen is dense enough and hot enough to show some of its characteristic lines,

Fbesides the line which is seen in other nebulse, and is the last to disappear by

reduction of density. No comet on visiting our system a second time can repeat
486 EEPOBT-- 1882.

the exclusion of its occluded gases unless its store has been replenished in the
interval. Tacchini has recently observed that Encke's comet, which is one of short
period that does not travel beyond the limits of our system, shows the usual spec-
trum of three bands. If this observation should be confirmed it will be very

difficult to account for the replenishment of its occluded erases. But Encke's comet
is a very small object, and one cannot feel very certain about its spectrum, and it
will be interesting to see, when HaUey's comet next returns, whether it shuies onlj'
by reflected light or gives us, like so many others, the banded spectrum of hydro-

carbons.

                    1. On tlie Legal Flashing Test for Petroleum.
                        By F. A. Abel, C.B., F.B.S., F.G.S.

     The author commenced by pointing out defects in the old legal flashing test,
called the open test, and in the test used in America, called the fire test, and the

circumstances that led to his investigation of the subject, resulting in the perfection

of a close flashing test, which in 1879 became the legal flashing test by Act of Par-
liament, a'nd which since that time has been used in the United Kingdom with
satisfactory resvdts. After a time this test had been adopted in the United States
and by the German Government. In course of the investigations instituted in
Germany Dr. Foerster and others had noticed (what had also become apparent

in this country) that decided variations in atmospheric pressure introduced con-

siderable variations in the test, when appUed to one and the same sample of oil,

either at difierent localities or during a continuance of very ditferent atmospheric

conditions. This had led the German Government to adopt a system of corrections

for atmospheric pressure in applying the test to the examination of petroleum
samples. The subject had been examined into by the author and Mr. B. lled-
wood, and a series of oljservations, instituted by the latter in different parts of
Switzerland, differing considerably in altitude, had indicated that very constant
иdifferences in the flashing point of a particular oil were occasioned by variations of

pressure, the difference appearing to amount to about two degrees Fahr. per inch of
mercury. The subject was still imder investigation, with a view to the adoption
of a proper system of correction in practice. Another point was the effect of con-
siderable variations in atmospheric temperature upon the flashing point of an oil.
Messrs. Abel and Redwood had carried on a series of experiments for the piu-pose
of ascertaining to what extent variations in the temperature of a sample, and in
the temperature of the locality where it was examined, would affect the flashing
point under the Abel test, and it had been established that it was not merely neces-
sary to cool down the sample of oil immediately before testing it, when the tem-
perature of the atmosphere exceeded 65░ Fahr., according to the directions given in
the Act, but that it was also imperative to maintain the oil to be tested for some
considerable period at a low temperature, if it had been stored for any length of
time in a locality where the temperature exceeded that above specified.

     The Indian Government had recently adopted, in a Petroleum Act, without any

modification, the instructions relating to the use of the flashing test included in the

English Act, and the serious difficulties to which this had given rise in connection
vsdth large importations of petroleum into India from the United States, where they

had passed the prescribed test, while on arrival at Bombay they exhibited consider-

ably lower flashing points, had led the author to examine into the subject in conjunc-

tion with Mr. Redwood, who has lately proceeded to India with the view of

thoroughly examining into the conditions to be fulfilled for securing the attainment

of trustworthy results by the application of the flashing test in a tropical climate.

  S. The Velocity of Explosion of a Mixture of Carbonic Oxide and Oxygen

     ivith varying quantities of Aqueous Vapour} By H. B. Dixon, M.A.

     The author endeavoured to compare the velocities of explosion of mixtures of car-
Ibonic oxide and oxygen with varying quantities of aqueous vapour hy observing the
pressure registered in a mercurial gauge attached to the Eudiometer in which the
-gases were tired. In each experiment the same mass of carbonic oxide and oxj-gen
was exploded at nearly constant temperature and volume. The gauge was U-shaped

And contained air in the closed limb. An index, similar to those used in Six's ther-

mometers, was carried up and left at the highest position reached by the mercury.
Near the bend of the gauge, two bulbs were blown in the tube as reservoirs, enabling
the mercury to be lowered in the Eudiometer without permitting the air to escape

from the closed limb.
     In two experiments a trace only of aqueous vapour was present. The Eudio-

meter was dried at 80^ by drawing through it for half an hour airwhich had
passed through two sulphuric acid drying tubes and a small tube containing phos-
phoric oxide. It was found that, by this method of drying, just sufficient aqueous
vapour remained in the tube to enable the explosion to talje place slowly when
sparks from a Ruhmkorff's coil were passed through the mixture of carbonic oxide

and oxygen. In the first experiment several sparks were passed before the gases

took fire. In both experiments the flame took about two seconds in passing down
the length of 500 mm. occupied by the gases in the Eudiometer. In three other

experiments measured quantities of aqueous vapour were added, the vapour being
kept below the satiu-ation point ; and in the last two experiments the space was
satm-ated with aqueous vapour, and the sides of the Eudiometer were wet. The

following table gives the quantities of aqueous vapour in each experiment,^ the

readings of the pressure gauge and the pressures corresponding with these readings.

last meeting. They can now give some particulars which they have since learned

concerning the nature of this occurrence.

They obtained large quantities of the deposit from the chambers of the Govern-

ment sulphuric acid works at Osaka, and foimd therein both selenium and

tellurium ; but all the specimens they could get of the sulphur burnt at these

works failed to yield these substances. Apparently the stock there of telluriferous

sulphur had been all consumed, and as these works have now ceased to be used,

--no new supplies of sulphur come to them. There are, however, private works at

Osaka--the Kawaguchi Sulphuric Acid Works and from these they have got a

sulphur, a specimen of which will be exhibited to the meeting. This sulphur is

quite different from ordinary sulphur in colour, being reddish-yellow. It has long

been distinguished by the Japanese from ordinary sulphur xmder the name of seki,

riu seki, massive red sulphur. The sulphur, of which a specimen is exhibited, is

Astated to come from Iwoshima (sulphur island) off the south of Japan.  speci-

men of sulphur not so red in colour in the mineralogical museum of this College,

and labelled ' From Iwoshima,' also contains selenium and tellurium. Another speci-
men in this collection of minerals, closely resembling that exhibited, and containing

these rare substances, is labelled as coming from the province of Echiu (Ishikawa

prefecture) in the west of Japan.

The specimen exhibited is not the sulphur in its native form, but in a refined

state obtained by liquation, and the same appears to be the case of the specimens in

the College museum. It will be seen to be a mixture of j-ellow and red sulphiu*.

The yellow they have found to contain only traces of tellurium and selenium.

The red sulphur has been analysed with the following results. For this

analysis they are indebted to Mr.Tetsukichi Shimidzu, a student of chemistry in their

College, who kindly consented to work with them lately, as they were pressed for

time in consequence of the specimen of red sulphm- having been only lately obtained.

     The occurrence of tellurium along with sulphur, belonging as these elements
do to the same chemical group, is, the authors think, of particular interest, as
hitherto tellurium has been only found in the pure state, or more commonly, like

sulphur, in combination with metals.

     They have done much work upon the deposit from the vitriol chambers, and
the tellurium and selenium they have separated from it, but they wish now only to

lay an account of the composition of this deposit before the meeting, thereby to
complete the natural history of the subject, as they hope to publish on a future oc-
casion the results of their other work.

     The mud-like deposit settled down on standing, leaving a pale jellow acid,
supernatant liquid, which was principally dilute sulphuric acid, and which had
a specific gravity of 1-15. Its colour was due to ferric sulphate, present in not
inconsiderable quantity. The authors obtained from one litre of this liquid

                                                   Tellurium, 0-37 grams.

     The deposit was drained of its liquor as far as practicable upon a filter, was

     The point which will attract attention in this analysis is that, whereas the
quantity of tellurium is to that of the selenium as 5 to 2 in the sulphur, and as 5'5 to
2 in the liquid with the deposit, it is only as 1 to 9 in the solid part of the deposit.
The explanation of this discrepancy is simple. They find by experiments with the
deposit itself and by others with pure tellurium, that tellurium in the finely divided

state readily oxidises in water exposed to air, and much more rapidly in the

presence of acid than not, whereas selenium is not sensibly afiiected. Therefore

the deposit, exposed as it had been to the air, contained much selenium with but

little tellurium, most of the tellurium having oxidised and gone into solution in the
liquid. It was to avoid further dissolution of the tellurium that they did not wash
the deposit for analysis.

     The deposit is of a grey-red colour, with a few bright yellow points, probably

orpiment, as yellow selenium sulphide is not permanent. On distilling the air-

dried deposit in clay retorts they foimd that the tellurium as well as the selenium all

distilled over. Much water and sulphur dioxide were given ofl', and at first also
a bright yellow sublimate, believed to be orpiment. The contents of the retort,

where the temperature had not been too high, contained galena, formed during the
heating, possessing a strong metallic lustre and marked crvstalline form.

diamond or carbon; and (3) the globular diamond or lort, in which he had de-

monstrated the second to be an agglomerate of small crystals cemented together

probably by hydrous oxide of iron, thus standing in much the same relation

to the first as does sandstone to quartz, while the bort shows confused crystal-

experiments which he had made, conjointly with Professor Behrens of Delft, on its

application to chemical and mineralogical researches. He exhibited carbon bores

contained in iron handles, the mineral being fixed by an eqnal mixture of wax and

colophonium. These handles are fixed in a turning' machine, and thus the hardest

minerals can be operated upon as easily as iron by steel. For purposes of chemical

analysis this process of obtaining a powder is better than the use of mortars of

agate, porcelain, or steel, as the powder has no admixture of particles worn away

from the mortar. One great difficulty, however, is that of gi\ing any desired shape

to the carbon, owing to its extreme hardness. This difficulty tlie author had over-

which had been thus acted upon were exhibited.

4. On the Action of the Component Salts as Nuclei on Supersaturated
     Solutions of certain Compound Salts. By John M. Thomson, F.C.S.

     In a paper published in the Chemical Society's Journal, May, 1879, on ' The
Action of Isomorphous Salts, in producing the Crystallisation of Supersaturated
Saline Solutions,' the author pointed out that if a mixture of dimorphous salts be
taken, a separation of the salts may be effected within certain limits by touching the
solution with a crystal of one or other of the salts ; this separation being limited
by and depending on the relative solubilities of the different salts contained in

the solution.

     The subject of the present paper is a continuation of these observations,
employing in |this case supersaturated solutions of double salts, where it was
possible to obtain such, and acting on them with nuclei consisting of one or other
of the component salts in order to find whether any disruption of the compound
takes place by the action of tlie nucleus. The method of carrying out the experi-
ments was exactly the same as that employed before, and fully described in his
first paper, the nucleus being added to the solution to be experimented on by one
of two methods: (1) by the nucleus being obtained by crystallisatio)i from a
supersaturated solution, and in this condition retained in the syphon-tube in the
neck of the flask till required for use ; or (2) the nucleus being added directly
from its mother-liquor in a bulb-tube suspended in a similar manner in the neck

of the flask.

     In all these experiments, as before, the substances were purified with the
greatest care, and the admission of particles from the external air most carefully
guarded against.

     The following tables give the results obtained with the different groups of salts

employed.

    From these tables it -will he seen tliat, in the case of the double chlorides,

bromides, and iodides, the salt of the heavy metal invariably caused the crystallisa-
tion of the double salt, whereas the constituent containing the alkali-metal had no

action. It was, however, impossible to determine whether the salt causing crystal-
lisation did so by first inducing the deposition of the salt analogous to itself in the

solution; experiments are being carried out to endeavour if possible to detei-mine
the primary action which takes place. It is, however, a somewhat dlfficidt one to

examine.                                                          j. и и

It may also be observed that when the mercuric chloride or bromide existed in

the nucleus in its true prismatic form, crystallisation at once took place, but that

when its deposition from its solution took place at a higher temperature the results

were various. On examining this point he finds that the crystalline form of the mer-

curic chloride and bromide change when so deposited, which may readily account

for the alternation in those cases. The- crystalline form also of the double salt is

more nearly allied to the form of the heavy metallic salt than to the constituent
containing the alkali-metal. In the case of the double cyanide and chloride, how-

ever, there is a distinct difierence from the halogen salts employed in the first-

mentioned experiments, both components producing the crystallisation of the

double salt.
492 EEPOET-- 1882.

It seems probable, therefore, that the double salts formed from these monobasic

acids, although they form good supersaturated solutions, are not so firmly united

together as to withstand the disturbing influence of certain of their constituents
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

but that the disruption produced by them is not sufficient to cause the decomposi-

tion of the body, and consequently the double salt is deposited. In the case last
mentioned, also, of the double cyanide and chloride, both salts are deposited as the

final result of the crystallisation.

     In experimenting with mercuric iodide, this substance was introduced by
means of a pipette-shaped tube, and the iodide strongly steamed by boiling the flask
before it was allowed to cool.

In the case of the alum and double phosphate, however, which may be taken

as examples of very definite double salts, neither of the components have any

action on the solution. In connection with the alum experiments some interesting

results were obtained from the double sulphate of zinc and copper, known as

'Lefort's salt,' the composition of which, according to that author, is Zn3Cu(S0j)^,

II^O, and which can be crystallised without decomposition.

Quantities of this salt were dissolved in half their weight of water, zinc

sulphate (ZnS0^,7H.,0) and copper sulphate (CuSOj,5H20) being employed as

the nuclei.

     In these cases both the constituents were active in causing crystallisation,

that from the zinc sulphate nucleus being more rapid than that from the copper

sulphate nucleus. An examination of the crystals deposited showed that they

were crystals of the double salt, and their deposition presented some very peculiar
phenomena, referred to at length in the paper.

     In the last group of salts employed, viz., the tartrates and citrates, it will be
observed that in the case of two of them one of the constituents w^as active and

one remained inert. It now became important to examine, if possible, the com-

position of the crystals which were gradually deposited from the nucleus. For

this piu^Dose experiments were carefully performed in flasks containing the

Rochelle salt, to which the nuclei of neutral sodium tartrate were added by means

of the syphon-tubes. The crystals gradually and slowly formed from the point

of the syphon-tube, and were allowed to grow till a considerable cluster had

formed, and a great part of the salt had been thus removed from the solution in
the flask. The deposit adhering to the syphon-tube was withdrawn from the

mother-liquor removed from the flask, washed with ice-cold water, pressed between
blotting paper, air-dried, and analysed. On analysis the deposit gave numbers

closely agreeing with the composition of Rochelle salt.

    Now it is to be observed that the crystals forming the deposit here in no wise

resemble those of Hochelle salt, but closely resemble those of sodiimi tartrate,

giving us evidence of the probable dimorphism of Rochelle salt.

At present it is difficult to see why the sodiimi tartrate should be active and

the potassium salt inactive ; but it may be remarked that the solubility of the

sodium salt is less than that of the potassium salt, which may perhaps account for

Aits activity.     corresponding result has been observed with the citrate ol

potassium and sodium, in which the sodium citrate has always proved active,

whilst the potassium salt is inactive. Here also the solubility of the potassium

salt is greater than that of the corresponding sodium salt.

     In the case, however, of the double magnesium and sodiimi citrates, the
results were dififerent, both of the constituent salts proving inactive to the double

salt.

    From these experiments it will be seen that the double salts of monobasic

acid apparently sufler disruption more easily than the salts from acid of higher

basicity, like sulphuric and phosphoric acids, but that in the case of the first

of these two latter acids, salts may exist, like Lefort's salt, which is acted upon by

the constituents.

It will be observed, however, that such salts indicate more of molecular than

of atomic grouping in their constitution, whereas in the alimi and double

phosphate we have a firmer union of the salts. This is also, the author thinks, to

be observed in the salts from the organic acids ; by its mode of formation and its

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I

composition, the double sodium and potassium citrate appears more like a
molecular grouping of the constituent salts, and both constituents are capable
of causing disruption, whereas in Rochelle salt and the magnesio-sodic citrate,
there is evidence of a closer binding of the component salts. In the case of
Rochelle salt only one constituent produces disruption, and in the case of the
magnesio-sodic citrate, neither constituent has any action. It is to be hoped that

experiments carried out on these solutions may assist in the examination of the
condition of such salts when in a state of solution.

6. On, the Decomposition hy Heat of Chlorate of Potassium. By Albert

                           RiLLiET and Professor J. M. Crafts.

     The cause and circumstances which favour this decomposition have been the
subject of much study, and the elder Mitscherlich and other great authorities have
offered solutions of the question, but none has met with general acceptation.
The authors desire to present a few new facts without dwellmg further upon any
theory than is necessary to bring out certain analogies, which have guided their ex-
periments, and which they hoped might lead to a partial explanation of some
points connected with the phenomenon.

     They have enlarged the knowledge of the number of bodies favouring the dis-
engagement of oxygen, and the discovery that pure metallic silver, reduced by
hydrogen from the chloride at a high temperature, has this action, appears to
destroy the usual theories regarding the function of the metallic oxides, which

produce the same effect.
      There is no necessity for recognising here any difference between the affinity

which comes into play during an act of solution, and that which governs any
chemical combination, and they supposed that the so-called catalytic bodies might

have the property in common of absorbing oxygen. Black oxide of manganese
was exposed to oxygen at exactly the conditions of the experiment in which it had

promoted the decomposition of chlorate of potash, but no action could be discovered
which w^ould explain the possibility that it might have a strong attraction for an

oxygenised body presented to it.

    A curious case was noticed, in which chemical affinity might be supposed to

determine the reaction. Gas-retort carbon can be completely burnt, chiefly to
carbonic acid, by contact at about 340 degrees with pulverised chlorate of potash.
There is no fusion ; every trace of the carbon gradually disappears, and the

greyish powder becomes white. The operation lasts one or two days. An

admixture of more than 10 per cent, of carbon provokes a violent reaction, with

disengagement of heat.

     In the same way that chemical formulas are used to express certain charac-

teristic qualities of bodies, symbolized under a conventional image of their con-
stitution, it is allowable to present possibilities of molecular action by a picture,
which bears little or no relation to the probable physical conformation of matter.

     Suppose all the atoms of a compound to be equidistant, and the distances to be
equally increased by an accession of heat, the sphere of chemical attraction might,
after passing a certain point, be overcome, and the only limit to a decomposition
with explosive rapidity would be the absorption of heat during the process. If
the condition of the molecule is more truly to be symbolised by atoms at irregular
distances irregularly affected by heat, which would cause from time to time a
single atom to overlap the boundary, a slow decomposition by heat is xuiderstand-
able. One can also imaghie heat from different sources, or conveyed through
different media, although producing this same mean movement of the particles,
still affecting them differently, in one case causing a large increase of movement in
a small number of atoms, in another producing the equivalent temperature by a
smaller movement imparted to a larger number of atoms. This last conception
may perhaps explain the intervention of certain bodies in the decomposition, and
it may be that their contact imparts heat-impulses of different qualities from those
of the substances, like silica and chloride of silver, which have no decomposing
--494
BEPORT 1882.

action. The authors have devised no experiments suited to test this hypothesis in
a satisfactory manner, hut the following account of the mode of decomposition of
chlorate of potash at a constant temperature is not inconsistent with its adoption.

     The temperature was maintained at a fixed point to within 0"-2 by means of
mercury boiling imder a constant pressure.

     Pure chlorate of potash begins to give oif oxygen at 330░ to 340░, far below its
melting point, and the decomposition goes on for several weeks before it becomes
imperceptibly small. After the limit is reached, if the temperature is raised, a

fresh decomposition tending towards a new limit takes place. At the tempera-

tures chiefly used, only a small percentage of the salt undergoes decomposition.

     The first stage of the decomposition is marked by a lower melting point of the
mixture of the residual salts, which usually fuse after several days.

     Pure chlorate of potash must undergo decomposition before fusion, although

the change of weight may be slight in a rapidly conducted operation.
     The addition of 10 to 20 per cent, of any of the substances known to favour the

decomposition has an effect exactly similar to the raising of the temperature : the
limit of decomposition is reached as before after a certain time.

          6. Hydrocarbons of the Formula (C^ Hg)^.^ By Professor
                               W. A. TiLDEN, F.B.S.

    To existing knowledge of isoprene the author adds the facts that its tetrahromide
CjHgBr , is a liquid which refuses to solidify at -- 18░, and which cannot be dis-
tilled without decomposition. The oxidation of isoprene by nitric acid leads to

the formation of a considerable quantity of oxalic acid, whilst chromic acid produces
formic and acetic acids. The remarkable production of caoutchouc by the action

of certain chemical agents upon isoprene led the author to make some experiments
with a view to ascertain whether this hydrocarbon coidd be obtained from other
sources, and bearing in mind the polymerisation of isoprene into a true turpentine
by the action of heat, it seemed not improbable that turpentine oil might be made
to yield it. On passing turpentine vapour through a i-ed-hot tube, a complex
mixture of hydrocarbons is obtained, from which may be isolated about 2 per

cent, of a volatile liquid, having the composition of isoprene and, so far as at
present observed, all its properties. The paper includes a theoretical discussion of
the formidss assignable to the eight possible compounds having the composition
OjHg, and of their relation to the terpenes.

7. Oil the Activity of Oxygen, and the Mode of Formation of Hydrogen
                   Dioxide." By C. T. Kingzett, F.I.C., F.G.8.

In this paper the author discusses the mode of formation of ozone and peroxide

of hydrogen by processes of slow oxidation. Referring to the views of Tbenard,

Lament, and others, and considering, in connection therewith, the results obtained

in his investigations of the atmospheric oxidation of phosphorus and the terpenes,

he discards the notion that in such processes molecular oxygen is split up into free

atoms by any outside act, so to speak. Turpentine and other terpenes absorb the

whole molecules of oxygen and ozone, and in Ijoth cases yield an identical organic

peroxide, which, by mere contact with water, produces hydrogen dioxide as a

secondary product. This secondary change is the result of a simple transference of

oxygen, or re-distribution of molecules.

The author further criticises the views of Traube ('Ber.' 15, 659-675), and

adduces evidence against the idea that in the formation of hydrogen dioxide it is

water that is decomposed. Finally, he proposes a new representation of the consti-

tution of hydrogen dioxide. Believing that oxygen has a variable acidity, and may

behave as a triad or tetrad, he represents peroxide of hydrogen as oxygenated

HOOHwater, OOHj rather than hydrogen dioxide,  ; this new representation more

adequately explaining the changes that the substance is known to undergo.

3. On the Reversals of the Spectral Lines of Metals. By Professor Liveing,

                            F.'B.S., and Professor Dewar, F.R.S.

     The authors have made a regular study of this subject, not only with a view
to trace the parallel between the conditions of the elements as they exist in the
sun and those in which they can be placed on earth, but also because a knowledge
of the reversible lines may help to distinguish those due directly to the vibrations
of the molecides from those produced by superposition of waves or by some strain
upon the molecules, such as an electric discharge might give. They classify the
reversals as follows. I. Reversals where the expanded line itself gives the back-
ground against which the absorption line, narrowed because density of the ab-

sorbent is less than that of the'emittent vapoiu-, is seen. These are the reversals
most generally known. 11. Reversals in which there is little or no expansion of
the lines, and the background is either the hot walls and end of a tube, the hot pole
 of the arc, or such part of the arc as is so full of lines as to be nearly continuous.

Many such reversals, including many lines of iron and other metals, were exhibited

in photographs. III. Reversals in which the background for the absorption was
produced by the expansion of a line of some other metal. Photographs of the
reversal of iron and other lines seen against the expanded magnesium^ lines were
 exhibited. IV. Reversals by the introduction into the crucible in which the arc
was passing, of a very gentle current of hydrogen, coal-gas, or ammonia, by which
the metallic lines are almost all swept away, and the continuous spectrum much

increased. V. When a carbon tube, passed through a perforation in a block of
496  REPORT 1882.

lime, is made the positive electrode of the arc, while a carbon rod, passed into
another perforation in the lime so as to meet the tube in the middle of the block,
is made the negative electrode, the tube becomes gradually heated up, and in the

direct line of the tube the metallic lines are seen bright because there is no back-
ground, but against the hot walls of the tube the same lines are seen reversed.
The effects of gradually increasing temperature were traced as the tube was
gradually heated. VI. Occasionally a double reversal of lines occurs, and a photo-

Kgraph was exhibited showing an expansion of the magnesium lines, between and L,

which extended so far as to produce reversal of the most refrangible two of the
cyanogen bands, the magnesium producing also a broad absorption band, against
which the magnesium triplet was seen bright and sharp. This seems due to the
less dense, but intensely heated, magnesium vapours, pushed forward up the tube
by the sudden burst of dense vapour evolved on dropping a fresh piece of magne-

sium into the arc.

                               4. On the Electric Furnace.

     By Dr. C. W. Siemens, F.B.S., and Professor A. K. Huntington.

     The electric furnace has previously been described in the Journal of the Society
of Telegraph Engineers, June, 1880. It has since been found advisable to sur-
round the furnace with a coil. By this means the direction of the arc can be
regulated at will, and the tendency which it has to fly to the sides of the crucible

be checked.

    The electrodes may be of such carbon as is used in electric lighting or of any
other convenient conducting substance. They may, if desired, be cooled by circu-
latino- water through or round them, or by exposing them as far as possible to the
air. For example, in one experiment a ^in. nickel positive pole was employed,

the lower end being inserted into a solid rod of copper about 1 in. square by 6 in.
long. With this pole, no other means of keeping it cool being adopted, 1 lb. of
grain nickel was fused in a clay crucible and poured in eight minutes, starting
with all cold. The electrode was but little attacked, and no leakage occurred.

     There are two great advantages possessed by the electric furnace, viz., that the
temperature attainable is practically only limited by the refractoriness of the
materials of which the furnace is constructed, and that the heat is developed im-
mediately in the material to be fused, instead of first having to pass through the
containing vessel. The temperature to be obtained by the use of fuel is limited
by dissociation. Deville has shown that carbonic acid undergoes dissociation at
the ordinary atmospheric pressure at about 2,GO0░ Cent. = 4,700░ Fahr.

     In the experiments made by the authors, five D-2 machines driven by a Mar-
shall's 12-horse power engine were employed : one being used as an exciter. The
current ranged between 250 and 300 amperes. The most refractory clay crucibles
supplied by the Patent Plumbago Crucible Company were invariably cut through
in a few minutes, and, except for experiments of short duration, were useless.
Plumbago crucibles stood exceedingly well. Obviously, however, they could not
be employed for all purposes, owing to their tendency to cause carburisation of the
metal experimented with. In some experiments the fusion of metal was effected
in a bed of lime, sand, or electric light carbon-dust. The latter is a very bad
conductor, and, as in the case of lime and sand, aUows the- arc when once formed

--to maintain a passage through it to the metal beneath.
      Wrought Iron. Six pounds of wrought iron were kept under the action of
the arc for twenty minutes, and the metal then poured into a mould. It was
fouud to be crystalline, and could not be forged. This is the result which has
always been obtained when iron, nickel, or cobalt have been fused. Although the
 remedy, viz., the addition of a little manganese just before pouring, is well known,

 the cause remains still imexplained.

   --Steel. As much as 20 lbs. of steel files have been melted in one charge, the

 time required being about one hour, starting with the furnace hot. With such

 large quantities the metal has invariably been full of blowholes.
                                                               TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                                   497

White iron, fused in a clay crucible for thirty minutes, when fractured did not

appear to have undergone any change. White iron and coke were introduced into

the furnace                                               the  resultant  metal was  slightly greyer  than  the  original.  When,
                                                       ;

however, retort-carbon was substituted for the coke a good grey iron, soft and

easily workable, was readily obtained in fifteen minutes, starting with' the crucible
hot. On another occasion, starting all cold, at the end of thirty minutes the

metal, although it had been well fused, had not been rendered greyer. The differ-

ence between these two results was possibly due to the temperature being some-

what higher in the one case than in the other. This is a point of considerable

practical interest. Four pounds of white iron, fused with carbon-dust for three-

quarters of an hour, yielded a very grey crystalline iron. In another experiment,

in which 8 ounces of grey iron, produced in the electric furnace from white iron,

were re-melted in carbon-dust for ten minutes, a very grey metal was obtained,

from which on slow cooling a large quantity of graphite separated.

      Cast iron, fused and kept under the action of the arc for forty-five minutes in
carbon-dust, was not materially changed as to greyness, and the general character

of the metal^as to, the way in which it worked under the tool was not materially

altered. The object of the experiment was to ascertain the maximum amount of

carbon iron is capable of taking up under circumstances presumably the most

favourable. The result is hardly that which would have been anticipated. Some

of the same cast iron was fused for fifteen minutes under lime, which nearly

covered it. The character of the fracture of the metal was but little altered by

this treatment, when slight differences, due to the rate of cooling, are taken into
Aaccount.
                                                          strong smell of phosphoretted hydrogen or of a phosphide was per-
--ceived probably the latter. This was only observed in the experiment in which
lime was used. The lime employed still retains a very offensive odour.

    When spiegeleisen was fused in a plumbago or a clay crucible graphite separated

as the metal cooled.

Siliceous piff iron containing about 10 per cent, silicon was fused by itself; it

Ashowed but little change, except that some graphite separated.                                                  similar result

was obtained when 5 lbs. of the siliceous pig were fused for one hour in carbon-

dust. On fracturing the ingot obtained, a large quantity of scales of graphite

was found in a hollow which traversed nearly the whole length of the ingot at

its centre. The fracture of the metal was still that so characteristic of highly

siliceous iron, and was practically the same as that of the original pig iron.

   A series of experiments was made to determine the maximum amount of car-

bon pig iron is capable of taking up in the presence of a given quantity of sUicon.

Grey cast iron and pig iron containing 10 per cent, of silicon were fused together

in carbon-dust, the ratio between them being varied so as to yield metal with from

\ per cent, to 9 per cent, of silicon.

   A similar series was made, only substituting sulphur for silicon. No odour of

sulphurous acid was perceived ; therefore, presumably, no sidphur was volatUised.

This is somewhat remarkable, considering the nature of the experiment. It was

thought that investigations of this kind might have an important practical, as well

--as more purely scientific, interest--admitting, for the sake of argument, that any

such distinction really exists in assisting to determine the conditions in the blast

furnace, &c.

   ANickel.-- positive pole of this metal--cast malleable by Wiggin & Co.'s pro-

--cess' |-in. in diameter, was passed through a hole in the bottom of a clay crucible.

A carbon negative pole was used, but soon after the commencement of the ex-

periment a deposit of nickel formed on the end of it, so that practically it was a

--nickel pole. This deposition of metal on the negative pole was also observed

with some other metals notably with tungsten. Whilst disclaiming any special

--knowledge on the point. Professor Huntington suggested whether this pheno-

menon which is the reverse of that generally recognised as taking place might

not depend on the relative volatility of the matter composing the poles. In the

furnace arranged as just described, 1 lb. of grain nickel was fused and pom-ed in

eight minutes. The fused metal had a brilliant granular fracture. It could not
be cut properly in the shaping machine, shearing off under tlie tool. One pound

of grain nickel fused in carbon dust for twenty-five minutes yielded a dark grey

carburised metal, which worked well under the tool. On another occasion an

equal quantity of nickel, similarly treated, gave a 'blowy' metal, which could not
be worked. Some carburised nickel, made as described above, was fused in a clay

crucible for twelve minutes, and allowed to cool gradually in the furnace ; the

--fracture became whiter, and the grain closer.
     Copper. Three-quarters of a poimd of copper were fused for about half an

hour in carbon-dust. On examining the result, it was found that all but about
|-oz. had been vaporised. Those who were present during the experiments

suffered no ill effects from the atmosphere charged with copper, which they must

--have breathed.
     Platinum. Eight pounds of platinum were rendered perfectly liquid in about

--a quarter of an hour.
     Tungsten. Half a pound of tungsten in powder was subjected to the action
of the arc in a clay crucible. Dense fumes were evolved, a cavity about 1^-in,
across the top being formed. The furnace was allowed to cool down slowly.

When the crucible was removed, it was found to ha'Ne been very much attacked

below the point to which the arc extended. The inference is that the crucible had

been attacked by the metal at the temperature of the experiment. The metal was

fused only to an inappreciable depth beneath the cavity formed by the arc. The

imfused metal underneath was covered with very beautiful iridescent crystals of

tungsten, which under the microscope appeared to be well-formed prisms. They

have not yet been measured. The crystals had evidently been formed by tlie slow

cooling of the vapour distilled down from the surface.

   A very large numlier of experiments was made with tungsten, the residts of

which showed that it could not be fused, except in very small quantities at a time.

It was possible to build up a small ingot by fusing a little of the tungsten, and
then adding little by little gradually. Even then the pieces obtained were for
the most part spongy and \insatisfactory. The best results arrived at were when
tungsten which had already been fused was employed in the building-up process.

When once the metal had been fused, it did not fume much in melting, doubtless

owing to the greatly reduced surface exposed.
    Tmigsten fused in the electric furnace is, when untarnished, pure white, and

brittle, the grain being very close. Tungsten hitherto has only been obtained as

a grey powder, by reducing the oxide with carbon or hydrogen, or in minute

globules in the ordinary small electric arc. Tungsten has its fusing point lowered
by the addition to it of carbon. Under these conditions a solid piece of moderate

size can, without much difficulty, be obtained. From 1,000 grains of powder fused

in carbon-dust 650 grains were recovered, the remainder having been volatilised,

and from 450 grains of the fused metal 410 grains were obtained on re-fusion.

One piece of tungsten which had been treated under the conditions most likely to
cause it to be highly carburised was analysed. It contained 1-8 per cent, of carbon.
The metal was very white, close in grain, and brittle.

    From the foregoing experiments it is clear that the amount of any given

metal which can be successfully fused in the electric furnace, and the time required
in effecting the fusion, are dependent on (a) the relation between the volatilising
point and the fusing point, i.e. the extent to which the volatilising point is higher

than the fusing point                                                                                 (6) the conductivity of the metal for heat.

It thus happens that platinum can be more readily melted than steel, and

in greater quantity for a given expenditure of energy. This inference is

believed by Professor Huntington to be justified by the observations and experi-

ments so far made.
     It still remains to examine chemically the specimens referred to in this

paper.

5. The Aerorthometer, an Instrumerit for correcting the Measure of a Gas.^
                       B]i A. Veknon Harcoukt, M.A., F.B.S.

In determining the mass of a gas, it is generally more convenient to measure than

to weigh. The volume multiplied by the density, which is known, gives the mass,

if the volume has been measured under standard conditions. Otherwise, the actual

--F= -^measurement must be corrected. The usual formula for correction,     ~^

meter, (3) t the temperature, (4j p the tension of aqueous vapour at t given by a

table.                                                        --*           !        and

   A reading of the aerorthometer gives at once the quantity

thus, to find V, the normal volume, it is only necessary to divide v by this reading.
     The instrument consists of two narrow vertical tubes, the one open above, the

other terminating in a a bulb whose capacity, including that of the stem down to
the first graduation, is 1,000 of the units into which the stem is divided ; both tubes
are connected below with a reservoir from which mercury can be driven up the

tubes by the pressure of a screw. When the mercury stands at the same level in
the open and closed tubes, the air in the closed tube, which at 0░0. and 7G0 mm.

occupies J ,000 volumes, is under the existing atmospheric pressure. It has also the
temperature of the surrounding air. It is thus under the same conditions as the
gas in any vessel near it. The volume read upon the aerorthometer is to l.COO as
the observed volume of the gas in the measuring vessel is to its normal or corrected
volume.

     For use in the ordinary case of measuring a gas over or in presence of water the
aerorthometer is charged with a minute drop of water. If filled with dry air its

reading gives  L_tiL_'. For technical purposes the graduation ' 1,000 ' marks

the volume which the inclosed air occupies at 30 inches Bar. and 60░ Fahr.

              6. A Revision of the Atomic Weight of Rubidiwm.

                                Bij Charles T. Heycock, B.A.

     The element rubidium has an atomic weight assigned to it usually of 85-4, and
consequently is removed from a whole number. Its revision therefore became of
interest, to see whether with improved methods it could be brought in accordance

with the hypothesis of Prout.

     The experiments here detailed are merely preliminary to a large number shortly
to be undertaken. The crude rubidium chloride was obtained from Dr. Theodore
Schuchardt of Goerlitz ; it was separated by Godeffroy's method with the alums. In

order to further purify it, the author converted the crude chloride into sulphate,
and decomposed this with an equivalent quantity of barium bitartrate. After
filtration, the mixed bitartrates of potassium, rubidium, and caesium were repeatedly

crystallised, the crops being separated. The bitartrate of rubidium separates from
its concentrated solution with ease, provided it is constantly stirred.

     The pure rubidium bitartrate was then decomposed by heating in a crucible of
platinum, and the resulting carbonate dissolved out and filtered from the carbon,
was divided into two portions, (a) and O).

     (a) was neutralised with excess of pure HCl. evaporated to dryness and fused.
The titration was made exactly as detailed by Stas, in his celebrated work, {Mem.
de VAcdd. de. Belgique, torn. xxxv. 1865), i.e. by adding to a known weight of silver
nitrate an equivalent quantity of rubidium chloride, calculated on the assumption

that Rb = 8iV0, in other words conforms with the hypothesis of Prout.

     The author then found in a beam of yellow light the amount of RbCl in excess

The mean of seven experiments conducted in this way gave him the ratio :

Ag : RbCl :: 107-93 : 120-801 ; this when chlorine = 35 467 gives for the atomic

weight of rubidium, 85-344.
     The portion |3 was converted into bromide by means of pure HBr. prepared as

described in Mr. Huntington's paper on the atomic weight of cadmium (' Proc.
Amer. Acad.') it had a constant boiling point of 126░ 0. Bar. 777 mm. after frac-

tionating six times.

    The first results were all far too high, the RbBr being contaminated with
platinum derived from the dish. The last two results when the weights are reduced

to a vacuum are not nearly so concordant as might be wished.

             RbBr when Br = 79955, 85-389.

     These bromide determinations are given with all reserve, as they are influenced
to a large extent by the correction for displacement which there is reason to believe

is far too high.

     The extended experiments will be published shortly. The mean error of the
atomic weight deduced from the chloride and bromide by the method of least
squares is + 0-0215. At present rubidium cannot be said to conform to Proufs

hypothesis.

7. On a method of obtaining Ammonia from Shoddy and Allied Substances.
                              By W. Mareiott, F.G.S.

     The author has for some time been engaged in devising a method of applying
on a large scale tlie principle adopted in any ordinary nitrogenous estimation by
means of soda lime, his object being to work up such nitrogenous substances as
wool or hair, and convert the nitrogen into ammonia.

     Mixing shoddy (the name by which this material is known) with lime and
soda, and subjecting the mixture to heat in a retort, has been tried many times
and with different apparatuses, but the return in ammonia never paid the cost of

working.

     Shoddy is a bulky material, so that a retort when charged with it holds but
little weight. And if the size and diameter of the retort are increased to overcome
this, the shoddy when carbonised is such a bad conductor of heat that the matter in

the centre of the retort is but slowly decomposed, although a great expense is in-

curred for fuel.

     To obviate this, and reduce the cost of fuel, he tried the burning of the shoddy
in a cupola heated by combustible gases. This, after several failures, he has suc-
ceeded in accomplishing, and also in making the process a continuous one.

     The principle he applies for this purpose, is to generate the heat of combustion
in contact with the nitrogenous matters operated upon, making sure that no free
oxygen is left with the products of the combustion.

     The construction of the apparatus may be thus explained.
     Nos. 1 and 2 are cupolas made of boiler-plate, and lined with fire-brick. In

No. 1 cupola, coke and small coal is burnt, the combustion being kept up by means
of a fan or air-pump along with high-pressure steam. The gases generated are
principally carbonic oxide, hydrogen, and marsh gas, along with the nitrogen of the
air blown in. These mixed gases are led into the bottom of cupola No. 2, and
there coming into contact with a jet of air, combustion ensues, and great heat is
generated, -which heat has to pass up through the material in the cupola.

     The point to be strictly observed is, that no more air be admitted than is
required for the combustion of the gases, and no free oxygen left in the atmo-
sphere heating the organic matters. The ammonia generated, along with the

residual gases, are passed through a saturator containing sulphuric acid to absorb
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  501

the ammonia, and the gases after passing through a condenser are finally burnt
under any appropriate apparatus. This final combustion of the gases does away
with any nuisance, besides utilising a considerable amount of heat derived from the

combustion of the organic matters.
      Difi'erent nitrogenous substances require different treatment before being fed

into cupola No. 2. Shoddy, for instance, is a dry product, and the nitrogen con-
tained in it is the only substance of value, the ash being worth little.

     In preparing shoddy for this piu'pose, we make a large heap, watering the

shoddy with a dilute solution of soda, containing the same weight of carbonate of
soda as the shoddy contains nitrogen. The heap of shoddy gradually heats and
diff"uses the moisture equally throughout the mass. This prevents the dust being

carried over by the current into the saturator.
      Before charging the prepared shoddy into the cupola it is mixed with about

G per cent of lime, in a moist powdery state. By this treatment 80 per cent, of the
nitrogen is converted into ammonia. The ash-dust and lime fall to the bottom,

and are withdrawn as they accumulate. This material is used as a manure.
      In applying this principle to nitrogenous matters containing phosphates, such as

fish or excreta, no lime or soda is added, and it is thus more of an economical
method of drying up these substances than combining their nitrogen into ammonia.
But even in drying part, carbonate of ammonia comes over, which is absorbed by

 the sulphuric acid.

      The dried matter, withdrawn as it accumulates, consists principally of phosphates,
 nitrogenous carbon, and potash. This residue, added to either fish or excreta in
 an offensive state, completely deodorises it, so that the operation can be carried on
 without a nuisance. The pressure under which the apparatus is worked must be

Asufficient to drive the gases and absorbable material through the saturators.

 quantity of tar and animal oil gradually comes over and accumulates in the catch-

  box.

     The author has not had much experience in applying this principle to the drying
 up of excrements such as that obtained by what is called the Rochdale tub system,
 but he has done sufficient to justify him in saying that it can be economically ap-

 plied to that purpose.
       In his experiments with excreta, instead of using an upright cupola, he used a

 long horizontal reverberatory furnace, heated on the frame principle, by gases
 generated in a separate cupola, and burnt so as to leave no free oxygen. The
 whole of the carbonate of ammonia is expelled at the boiling temperature, and is

 retained in the saturators.

      The residue is a dry carbonaceous powder, containing all the inorganic con-

 stituents of the excreta.

--Tho President delivei-ed the following Address :

For some years it has heen the rule or practice that the Presidents should open the
sectional meetings with an address, selecting any subject which may seem to them

best adapted to the occasion. This custom I believe had its origin in this Section,

when the Association met at Aberdeen, and was due to Sir 0. Lyell, who was the

first to deliver au opening address. lie selected for his theme the discoveries of

M. Boucher de Perthes, chiefly with relation to the occurrence and association of

flint weapons with the bones of extinct animals in the gravels of the valley of the

Somme.

The Geological Section, over which during the present meeting I have the

honour to preside, embraces a wide field of researcli, and therefore allows selection

from a large range of subjects, so large indeed that it would be difficult to choose

an original one that would be acceptable and useful to those members of the

Association who may be present. It is thirty-six years since the British Asso-

ciation last met in Southampton, and probably not half-a-dozen members who

Weattended the meeting of 1846 are now present, if living.  are, however, for-

tunate in having with us to-day one or two who contributed papers to this Section

thirty-six years ago.

The Geological Section may be congratulated on its place of meeting this year.

Hampshire presents a wide range and field of research to the practical, as well as to

the less advanced student in geology. Truly may it be said that this area is classic
ground. No less than six distinct formations, with their subdivisions, occur in
the immediate neighbourhood and within reach of those members who have

honoured the Association with their presence this j-ear. Be it remembered that

it is thirty-six years since the British Association met in this city. Since then,

or the year 184G, geology has indeed advanced with strides unsurpassed by any

other science. The Tertiary rocks of the Hampshire basin alone have received from

 the hands of private and learned physicists, as well as the long-continued labour of

 the Geological Survey, the most careful and detailed research. It may well be said

:

that this rich field has not wanted competent labourers, earliest and foremost of

whom must be named Webster, Sedgwick, Prestwich, and Edward Forbes, who

with Mr. Bristow mapped out with so much care and accuracy the intricate struc-

ture of the Isle of Wight. To these must be added, through later research, the

names of Searles AVood, Wright, Fisher, Tawney, Keeping, Judd, and others. Other

portions of Hampshire and Sussex bearing upon the question of the Anglo-French

Tertiary basin, have been elaborately treated by Dixon, Godwin-Austen, Sir

C. Lyell, and others.

    It may be a fitting preliminary to local communications which will most pro-

bably come in, during the course of this meeting, that I should summarise what

has been done in this area. This may be familiar to many, but there are others
who may wish to examine certain geological localities, the mention of which may

induce them to visit spots of much interest. It is scarcely the duty of the president

of this Section to devote the time allowed to an opening address to the discussion

of any original subject, while work of unusual local interest has transpired during

the past year to justify him in drawing attention to a subject of much importance
                       TRANSACTION'S OF SECTION C.            503

connected with the stratigraphical position of certain beds in the Eocene strata of

the Isle of Wight ; a question of local geological interest, as well as bearing upon
the correlation of the Tertiary rocks of Hampshire with those of France, Belgium,

and Germany. Instead, therefore, of offering to the Geological Section an address
on some special subject or branch of general geology, I have deemed it more in-

teresting, aod certainly more useful, to lay before you an outline of certainphysical
features occurring within the immediate neighbourhood, and the district in which

we are now assembled.

I purpose therefore to call attention to the local geology of this area, especially

as regards the Tertiary deposits of Hampshire and Sussex, as forming or con-

.stituting the northern portion of a vast series of deposits once continuous to

Northern France, the area now covered by the English Channel and the Solent,

and lying in the depression of the Jurassic and cretaceous series. The relation also

of the Hampshire and Anglo-French basin and its tertiary fauna to that of the

London or Anglo-Belgian area will receive notice, as being part of the history of one
great period, the strata comprising the two areas being also once continuous, much

of it being subsequently removed or denuded away from those areas now occupied

by the English Channel and German Ocean.
    Before especially noticing the Isle of Wight and the neighbouring cuasts, I must

state that by laborious search over both old and new ground, and through the very

careful examination of collected specimens during the past twenty years, great light

has been thrown on the geological structure of many local areas hitherto obscure

from want of critical palseontological knowledge being brought to bear iipon the
fossil fauna or flora characterising the various marine and freshwater deposits with_

which the surrounding district aboimds. Greater precision has of late been arrived
at in the chronological arrangement of the cretaceous and tertiary strata which

occur both in the Isle of Wight and on the mainland.                 -^

                                                              _

Doubtless you are all aware that the strictest investigation as to the distribu-

tion and organic contents of the Fluvio-marine Tertiaries of the Isle of Wight, was

undertaken by Professor Edward Forbes, when attached to the Geological Survey

from the years 1848-50, and subsequently Mr. H. W. Bristow, F.E.S., completed

all the older tertiaries and cretaceous rocks of the island, thus producing a complete

geological guide to this portion of the Hampshire basin. The structure of the

opposite coast to the east, or that embracmg Bracklesham Bay, Selsea, and
Bognor, was critically treated by Mr. Frederick Dixon in the year 1850,^ who

was most ably assisted in his palseontological researches by the most distinguished

natiu-alists then living, each faunal group receiving critical supervision and de-

Ascription.    second edition of this valuable work appeared in 1878, wherein much

new geological and palfeontological matter is added. Both the Cretaceous and

Tertiary reptiles were figured and described by Professors Owen and Bell, the

fishes by Sir  Philip  Egerton, the Cretaceous echinodermata  by Professor Forbes
                                                                                                                                                             ;

Mr. Sowerby described the mollusca, the large Crustacea were described by Pro-

fessor Bell, and the corals by Lonsdale.

    I now draw your attention to a locality of extreme interest both to the geologist

and archajologist, and where cause and effect are manifested in both investig.itious,
the historical portion being based upon physical causes and changes that have long
been, and are still going on, to modify the form, extent, and structure of tlie Sussex
coast, from the mouth of Cliichester Harbour to Littlehampton and Bognor. In
the year 1855 Mr. liobert Godwin-Austen, F.R.S. and G.S., read before tlie Geolo-
gical Society an elaborate paper upon the ' Newer Tertiary Deposits of tlie Sussex
Coast,' in wliich he also noticed some peculiar features in the parts of the Isle of

Wight and South Hants bordering the Solent.

504 REPORT-- 1882.

there intervenes a tract between the chalk range and the sea, which ultimately

acquires a width of ten miles, as from Lavant to Selsea. This tract is low and level,

presenting a series of superficial accumulations, remnants of a definite Tertiary

period, of which at no other place in England is there any such record, and to

which I ask your attention should any journey to inspect the phenomena exposed

along the shore of Bracklesham Bay, or between Wittering and Pagham Harbour,
or Bognor be proposed. Especially may I refer to interesting evidence as to local
<'.onditions during the glacial period. It may not be known to many, or all present,

that the peninsula of Selsea is celebrated in English history as one of the places

where Christianity was first taught in this country. It was one of the most ancient

Saxon establishments. This peninsula was granted by Edilwalch, King of the

South Saxons, to Wilfred the exOed Bishop of York, about the year 680. At that

time it is stated to have contained 6,220 acres of land, with 85 families and 250

slaves. The parish now contains only 2,880 acres ; 2,340 having been slowly

denuded away by the action and encroachment of the sea. This encroachment and

destruction during the past 800 years has been very extensive.

The creek called Pagham Harbour, on the south-east side of the Bill or pen-

insula, was due to an irruption before the year 1.346, when 2,700 acres of land were

destroyed. The site of the ancient cathedral and episcopal palace of Selsea, be-

lieved to have been situated to the south-east of the present church of Pagham, is

no longer to be determined, but there is no reason to doubt but that it stood nearly

a mile out in what is now sea. Camden, in his ' Britannia,' states that ' in this isle

remaineth only the dead carkase as it were, of that ancient little citie (where those

bishops (of Selsea) had their seat), hidden quite with water at every tide, but at

low water evident and plain to be seen.'

The Bishop's Park, as the shore and sands are still called, extended for many

acres on the south-east coast, and the remaining fragment has still the name of Park

Coppice. The sea has gained more than a mile on this coast since the see and cathe-

dral of Selsea was established a.d. 680 ; Wilfrid was the first Bishop of Selsea in

that year, and Stigand was the first Bishop of Chichester a.d. 1070. No less than

twenty-two Bishops had occupied the episcopal chair of Selsea, and resided there, be-

fore the removal to Chichester. The parish that divides Selsea from Bognor is called

Pagham, and the extensive estuary, which is a mile long and broad in places, Pagham

Harbour. The remarkable church is dedicated to St. Thomas a Becket, and the

ruins of the archiepiscopal palace are still visible south-east of the church. Arch-

bishop Becket resided here with a large retinue, and his interference with a manor

within this lordship gave rise to his dissension with Henry II. which terminated

in his assassination. That part of the coast marked 'the Park/ now covered by the

sea, was part of the prelate's extensive estate, and is still visible at low water. The

houses of the village are built of an arenaceous limestone almost entirely made up

of microscopical shells, of the genera Miliola and Alveolina. This stone was formerly

procured abundantly from an extensive range or ledge of rocks (called the Clibs

and Mixen) south of Selsea Bill, and extending some distance east and west. In

1830 the removal of this bed of stone was forbidden, forming, as it did and does, a

barrier to the encroachment of the sea.

This digression and somewhat archaeological dissertation is necessary for my

purpose, when drawing your attention to those recent geological changes that have

taken place along that coast almost within modern times.

Thorney, Ham, and Medmeney marshes, behind Bracklesham Bay, and between

Bracklesham and Selsea, are of marine or estuarine origin, separating Selsea from

the mainland, making it what its name expresses, an island, ' Seles-eu,' or ' I.Фland

Weof the Sea-calf.'  are thus led to believe that when Selsea became known to

the English nation it was an island, and that iu Bede's time the process of silting

up the estuary must have commenced, and the completion of this process would

seem to have been before the Conquest. The action of the tides on this coast carries

the sand and shingle from west to east, therefore the gradual wasting which has

taken place on the shore of Bracklesham Bay has served to supply a large

portion of the material of which these marshes are formed.

The ground on which Selsea, Bognor, Littlehampton, Worthing, and other
                TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                    505

places on the Sussex coast westward of Brighton are built, is of very recent for-

mation, being composed of gravels, sands, and loam belonging to the post-

Pleiocene or Pleistocene series. These superficial post-Pleiocene beds overlie

the well-known Eocene series in patches, and contain a large fauna. No less

than 66 genera and 142 species, chiefly mollusca, occur here. The remains of the

mammoth or elephant {E. primigenius, or antiqiius) occur in the muddy deposits
[mud-deposit]. With these are associated marine shells of existing species, but
some not known now as such on the Sussex coast. East of Bognor, at low tides, we

have the remains of a sunken forest, and west of Selsea the trunks and roots of trees,

&c., may be examined at low water. These trees in both areas are not fossilized,

but evidently destroyed by the encroachment of the sea, probably since the time
when 'the Park' existed. In July, 1877, Mr. H. Willett, of Brighton, obtained

from the beach below high-water mark, near East Wittering, a large number of

bones of rhinoceros associated with several species of land and freshwater shells

of existing species. The bones lay in the midst of decayed trees in a peaty deposit

Anbeneath the glacial beds of Selsea.  almost perfect skeleton of the Elephas

antiquus is in the Museum at Chichester, which was obtained from the ' mud

mudbeds ' or '  deposit ' ofl" Selsea Bill ; multitudes of the shell Pholas a-tspata,

occur in the same bed. Teeth of the mammoth have occurred in the 'mud-

deposits ' of Bognor, Littlebampton, and Worthing ; and we have again the well-
known ' Elephant bed' at Brighton, doubtless of the same age.

    At the British Association meeting in 1851, Mr. Godwin-Austen, F.R.S., then

president of the Geological Section, called attention to the evidence of repeated

oscillations of level, of no very remote date, which were to be observed in parts of

the coast of Cornwall, Devon, the Channel Islands, and the Cotentin, an area

comprising the western opening of the English Channel. As before stated, the same

distinguished physicist, four years later, in his paper 'On the newer Tertiary

Deposits of the Sussex Coast,' exhaustively described the phenomena of the later

movements of the land, and interchanges between the sea and the coast. The

oldest of the newer-Tertiary deposits of the Sussex levels in ascending order is to be

seen only at extreme low-water in Bracklesham Bay ; thence eastward round Selsea
Bill, as far as the entrance into Pagham Harbour.

This portion of the Sussex series forms the 'mud-deposit' of Mr. Dixon. Its

character and composition distinguish it from the beds above. It is composed of

an extremely fine tenacious dark grey sandy mud, which resists the action of the

sea ; it rests upon the well-known Eocene Nummulitic strata.

The thickness of this Lutraria clay or ' mud-deposit,' can only be estimated at

low-water spring tides ; in places it is from 18 to 20 feet thick ; it increases

seawards and passes away beneath the sea-bed. On the coast near Medmeney

(west side of the Bill) the surface of this clay is occupied by the remains of a colony

of Pholas ct-ispata, which has burrowed into it. This species attains here to great

dimensions, and from its restricted range and littoral habit serves to determine the

level of the tidal waters at the commencement of the Selsea deposits. The relative

age of this old estuarine deposit of Selsea is determined by its mammalian

remains. Those of Elephas primigenius are tolerably abundant, and the interest

attached to them is enhanced by the fact that they do not occur here as single and

detached teeth, or portions of tusks (as occurs on the higher gravels), but so many

parts have been found together as to leave no doubt but that entire skeletons still

lie embedded in this deposit. The head with the teeth and tusks and numerous

bones have been found in close juxtaposition, and are now placed in the Chichester
Museum. No less than sixty-six genera and 151 species of mollusca have been

found here, or thirty-three genera and eighty-nine species of gasteropoda, and

thirty-three genera and sixty-two species of pelycipoda, have been obtained from

the Lutraria clay or ' mud-bed.' I may mention, among so many, the rarer shells

that occur :
--ACerithium reticidatum, da Costa. = C. lima, Brug.
                                                      Spanish, Portuguese, and

Mediterranean shell, comparatively recent within our area.
--AFusus turricula (Pleurotoma).
                                  boreal Atlantic species, ^occurs in the Eed Crag.

Scarce in the Faluns and Bridlington.
506 REPOET-- 1882.

--Pecten polymorphus, Bronn. Lisbon, Mediterranean, very rare fossil in Italian

and Sicilian beds.

Tapes decussata, ranges south but not north of British Islands. Common in the

Mediterranean.

  --Lutraria rugosa. Algeria and Morocco (living), also Canaries. South of

Spain and Portugal.

Syndomnya JBoysii (Amphidesma).--Atlantic ; rare ; ranges to coast of Spain.

--Pholas crispata, Linn. Rare on south coast of England, a Scandinavian species,

and is found in the Crag.

    From ' the assemblage of moUusca, and the patch of Pholas crispata in conjunc-
tion with conditions of the deposit, we may infer that the relation of the land to

sea-level was then much what it is now, or that these ledges of mud-beds in which

this shell is found, then lay between tides.' Many of the bivalve moUusca

(Pelycipoda) lived in and on this mud, which is evident from the position in which
the shells are now foimd, especially the Mya, Lutrarice, and Pullastra (Tapes).

* This area,' according to the views of Mr. Godwin-Austen, ' must have been an en-

closed salt-water lagoon. The list of shells must be considered a special one, the

result of local conditions subordinate to, but indicative of, a much larger marine

fauna which had its fuU development in some adjacent sea ; and this fauna as a
whole differed as much from that of the present Channel waters, as the fossil con-

tents of the Selsea mud-deposits do from the mollusca now inhabiting the series of

large creeks and lagoons extending from Fareham to Pagliam.' As regards the

molluscan faima of Selsea, some of which, now found on the Sussex coast, are es-

sentially southern and western, they do not range further north , or into the German
Ocean area, and this southern relation of the fauna of the Lower Selsea deposit

(^Lutraria tnud-deposit) is further strikingly illustrated by the presence of the before-

mentioned two remarkable species, Pecten polymorphus BXiA Lutraria ╗*m<70S(7, neither

Weof which are now known to range further north than Lisbon. '  therefore have

indications of a warmer condition of the waters of the English Channel, which

allowed southern forms to range to a more northern latitude than now, and then

a limitation of these forms to the area where now found, or in the Sussex deposits.'

The inference drawn by Mr. Godwin-Austen as to the manner in which the ele-

phant's remains occur in this Lutraria clay is an ob^-ious and an interesting one, as

it enables us to arrive at a relative geological date, showing that the lower estua-

rine beds of Selsea and of the Sussex levels generally were contemporary with what

is known as the period of the large mammalian fauna.

    Overlying this Lutraria or mud deposit, there occurs a tough, calcareous, sandy

--clay, with chalk, and chalk flints waterworn and of large size. This Yellow

Drift clay is of marine origin, determined by the associated mollusca ; Littorina and

Mytilus being disseminated through the mass. This deposit occurs over the whole

of the Selsea peninsula, and extends inland beneath the Sussex levels. Besides the

large masses of hints and materials from the chalk, oolitic rocks, and chert-sandstone

from the Upper Greensand, resembling that occurring at Lyme and Charmouth, there

are other rocks which, from their ' ages, composition, origin, size, and condition,'
render the mode of accumulation a problem of great geological interest. ' The rocks

in question consist of grey porphyritic granites, red syenites, syenite, homblendic

greenstones, mica-schists, green fissile slates, masses of quartz from veins, siliceous

sandstones,' such as occur in the Palaeozoic series (Lower Silurian) of Normandy,

micaceous sandstone with orthides, probably from the Devonian beds, and blocks

of compact limestone, whether from the Devonian series of Devon or the Cotentin

(France), is uncertain.'

In size these older rocks range from coarse shingle up to masses of 20 tons

weight, the granitic rocks being the most numerous and of the largest dimensions.

A mass of porphyritic rock was exposed near Paghatn by coast -line denudation,

measuring 27 feet in circumference. Whence came they, and how brought, or
what the transporting agent beyond that of iloating ice, we know not. I must

refer you to Mr. R. Godwin-Austen's original paper for matter of the highest

interest relative to the origin and history of the yellow clay and the conglomerate

bed, and later deposits in Sussex, as well as other phenomena bearing upon the
                                                                                      TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                                                                                                                                                  507

   physical geography of the district both of Northern France and Southern England.

     --' T/te Brick-earth. Above the yellow clay and mammalian gravels, the highest or

   uppermost deposit on the coast, there occurs a uniform bed of dark chocolate-coloured
   unstratified clay, averaging about 3 feet in thickness. This clay forms part of that
   great layer of earthy matter which overlies all the gi-avel and other beds of the

   Sussex levels, and is extensively used for brickmaking. This brick-earth is a
   subaerial deposit, probably occurring as the wash of a terrestrial surface under a

   greater rainfall than we have now. This deposit is conspicuously shown along the
   shore, and forms the low cliffs of Bracklesham Bay. To this period Mr. Godwin-
   Austen refers the ' Combe rock ' of Selsea. He then refers to the condition of the
   English Channel area, at the period of the Crag-deposits of the German Ocean. The

   author is disposed to the belief that this Channel area was mostly in the condition
   of dry land at the time that the area of the German Ocean was occupied by the

   Crag sea. The peculiar molluscan fauna of the Sussex deposits point to a limitation
   of a marine province in that direction, whilst their habits indicate at the same time
   shallow water and marginal conditions. The temperatvire of the water of the

   English Channel during the period of the JEleplias ]mmigenius, and its associates,

   was such as now occurs 12 degrees or nearly 800 miles further south. In 1871

   Mr. Alfred Bell examined with great care the fossil contents of the Lutraria clay or

   mud-deposit ; he has added materially to the hitherto published lists of contents

   of this deposit. The result proves it to be unique as regards the fauna. ' Of the
   144 species of shells Mr. Bell states that 30 do not exist nearer than the West of

   England, the Channel Islands, North of Spain, 8 or 10 not passing this side or

   north of Gibraltar, all being littoral (or sub-littoral) species. As British Quaternary

   fossils 45 are peculiar to Selsea, and 20 others probably find here their earliest

   place in British geological history.' Numerically the contents of this mud-deposit

   are as follows : mammalia, 5 genera and 6 species ; mollusca (bivalves), 33 genera

   and 62 species                                                                     univalves, 32 genera and 80 species                                                                                                                                   polyzoa, 2 species ;  Crustacea,
                                                                                   ;                                                                                                                                                                     ;

   8 genera and 10 species ; echinodermata, 2 genera and 2 species ; foraminifera,

   9 genera and 10 species. Most of the fossils occur opposite Thorney coastguaril

   station, where the Lutraria clay rises at intervals in low hummocks. The elephant

   remains appear to be those of E. anf.iqwus. The tooth of E. meridionalis has also

   occurred here, an association resembling the Forest-bed of Cromer. In the Chichester

   Museum there exists the greater portion of a fine skeleton of E. antiquus obtained
   from this mud deposit.

   I have thus dwelt at some length upon these post-Pleiocene or Pleistocene beds

   at Selsea, owing to their local interest, and hope by so doing to induce any present

   who may be interested in the Quaternary geology of the British Islands, especially
   that of Sussex, to visit Bracklesham Bay and Selsea, near to which we are now

   assembled.

   The Eocene Fokmations op Selsea and Bkackleshasi Bat.

         It is impossible to pass unnoticed the Eocene tertiaries that occur in Brackles-

   ham Bay, the stratigraphical position of which has long been settled, comprising

   the middle portion or fossiliferous division of the Bagshot Series. The Bracklesham
   beds take their name from the Bay in which they are so characteristically developed,
   yet difficult to clearly imderstand. The main divisions extend fi-om Wittering,
   on the west, to the Barn Rocks, east of Selsea Bill, a distance of seven miles.

        The Hampshire basin alone, in England, contains the nummulitic series, no
   fossiliferous representative being known in the London basin.

        About a mile to the east of Selsea Bill is situated the ' Park bed.' This Park bed

   is analogous or equivalent to the 'Calcaire grossier' of Grignou, in the Paris basin.'

   It contains thousands of Nummulina laevigata associated with Perna, Bulla, Cyprrea,

   *и ' Four hundred species of Mollusca have been found in the French deposits.

Solen, besides the well-known coral Litharea Websteri. The Park bed is situated
close to the shore, and is accessible at low water. It is here at low spring tides that

the very recent post-Pleiocene beds may be seen overlying the Eocene deposits. At

the Bill the Eocene beds are shown at low water in large detached portions called
the 'Clibs/the lai'ger portion lying to the south-west, and the so-called 'Mixen Rocks,'
marked by the ' Mixen Pole,' trend about a mile out in the sea. From these rocks,
which extend a mile and a half east and west, and varying from 200 to 400 yards
wide, is procured the AlveoUna or foraminiferal limestone ; the ' Clibs ' rock contains
scarcely any other fossil remains. The Houngate Rocks, the same as the Mixen, are
situated opposite Old Thorney Station House, and visible at low water ; they are
nearly a mile in extent, and vary from 50 to 60 yards in width. Certain fossils
have given names to the beds that range through the bay. The remarkable shells

Cypraia Coombii, the great Ceritheum (C. (ligantemn), and C. cornucopics, Veneri-

cardia planicosta, TurriteUa terehellata, Conus diadema, Sec, amongst many others,

aid us to determine the beds stratigraphically ; locally the ' Barn bed,' ' Palate

bed,' ' Veuericardia bed,' the ' Park,' &c., serve to mai-k horizons of importance.

    Opposite the New Thorney Station are the Scrobicularia or Lutraria clays or
mud deposits from which the elephant remains were obtained.

     The Rev. Osmond Fisher, in his description of the ' Bracklesham beds ' of the
Isle of Wight basin, restricts the name to a group of strata rich in organic
remains, the greater part of which are displayed at low water upon the shore at

Bracklesham Bay in Sussex. He also includes under that name higher beds than
any seen at Bracklesham Bay that occur at Stubbington and the New Forest. He

groups certain strata which appear to intervene between the base of the Barton
series and the highest beds at Bracklesham Bay on account of their containing
an assemblage of fossils more akin to the fauna of the Bracklesham than the
Barton.

    ' No marine fossiliferous beds are known beloiv the lowest at Bracklesham Bay,

-- --until we reach the Bognor Rock of the London clay at Bognor except it be a

thin stratum of clay at the very base of the Bracklesham series at Whitecliff Bay.
The following shells range through the Bracklesham group, and are confined to it,

viz., Venericardia jdanicosta, Sanguinolaria HoUotoaysii, Solen ohliquus, Cytherea

suberycinoides, Valuta cithara, Turritella sulcifera, and I'ecten coiiieus ; the last-

named species occurs in the High Cliff beds.' The Rev. 0.- Fisher, through the
confined range of certain species, has divided the whole series into four prin-
cipal groups. Vide ' Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society,' vol. xviii.

pp. 66-75.

    AGroup The upper, abounding in gasteropoda, and has one of its fossil beds

                    in the eastern part of its range full of Nummvlina variolaria.

     BGroup is more sandy in its general condition, and distinguished by the

                      presence of the large gasteropoda. Cerithium giganteum, Numtrndina

                   variolaria, occurs in this member at Whiteclitf Bay.

     Group C Sandy like the last, but its chief fossil-bearing bed is profusely
                   crowded with Nummulina Icevigata.

     DGroup embraces the lowest fossiliferous sands of Bracklesham Bay. The.

                     distinctive shells are Cardita acuticosta and Cyprma tuberculosa.

--Bracldesham beds at Whitecliff Bay. These beds rest on the Lower Bagshot

sands, and agree with bed No. 6 of Professor Prestwich's section, their base being

distinguished by a bed of rolled flint pebbles about 1 foot in thickness.

Reading in descending order Mr. Fisher's group A, including the beds xLx.,

xviii., xvii., xvi., xv., xiv., and xiii., correspond with the beds numbered 17, 16,

15, and 14 in Professor Prestwich's ; together they measure 254 feet. The position

of the beds here renders them easily accessible at Bracklesham Bay, but they are

nearly horizontal, and consequently must be paced to be understood. Beds

ANo. xvii. and xiv. of Group  ai'e the most fossiliferous, and both contain

Nummulina variolaria.

wicb's No. 13. No. ix. of Fisher and 13 of Prestwich is the chief fossiliferous had.

Nuimmdinn variolaria, Valuta nodosa, and Sanguinolaria Holloxoaysii, are the chief

fossils in this bed ; the thickness of the group is only 27 feet.

Group 0, Avith beds viii., vii., and xi., correspond to Professor Prestwich's

Nos. 2 and 11. No. vii. contains the distinctive and characteristic nummulite, N.

teyjY^rtffa, also equally abundant at Bracklesham Bay with Sanguinolaria HoUoxcaysii.

Bed No. vi. of Fisher, and No. 1 of Prestwich, is very fossiiiferous. These 3 beds

measiure 123 feet.

DGroup      is composed of beds No. v., iv., iii., ii., and i., or Nos. 10, 9, 8, 7, and

6 of Prestwich. The only fossiliferous bed in this group is No. iv. of Fisher, and 9

of Prestwich, in which the great Venericardia planicosta abounds, as at Brackles-

ham Bay, the fine shell Cyprcea tuberculosa not occurring at Whitecliff Bay. The

beds comprising this group are 251 feet thick ; in all, the Bracklesham beds

at Whitecliff Bay measure 653 feet. I have deemed it important to partly

particularize this remarkable section at Whitecliff Bay by way of comparison

with the fine section shown at low water in Bracklesham Bay, where the beds

occupy the shallow shore for 3| to 4 miles, and are nearly horizontal, or dip

S. by E., with a strike of W. by S. and E. by N. So nearly level are the beds,

that there is no opportunity given to measure the dip or thickness with accuracy.

Mr. Fisher, in his excellent section, has given the order of succession of the beds,

and the distances between the outcrops. The beds exposed towards, or near

Selsea Bill, belong to the upper members, and their strike is nearly tangential to

the shore, consequently we continue our walk upon the same outcrop for a long

distance in step-like planes. I give the Rev. O. Fisher's section and sequence

round Selsea Bill as he observed them, as a guide to those who may visit the area.

 the Upper Marine Series,^ treating of the coast section between Bournemouth and

 Highcliff; and a second paper, Part II., on the lower or Freshwater series.- He

 states his reason for differing from the previous writers upon the succession of the
 heds and their correlation with other localities. Mr. Gardner's researches are in-
 tended to show that the celebrated Bournemouth leaf-beds immediately underlie the

 true Bracklesham series, and are, unlike those of Alum Bay, of Middle and not of

 Loiver Bagshot period, hitherto the received \'iew as to their age. The author has

 also ascertained that a great portion of the cliffs between Hengistbuiy Head and
 Bournemouth are of marine origin, and liighly fossiliferous. These marine beds
 comprise two distinct characters, which the author traces across to Alum Bay in

 the Isle of Wight. Mr. Gardner also differs from the Geological Survey in" be-
 lieving ' that the so-called Upper Bagshot beds of the London basin do not belong

 to that_ series, but are the equivalents of his Boscombe sands ; these sands, and
 the marine Bournemouth beds being, according to his researches, the western equiva-
 lents, or extreme shore-condition of the Bracklesham sea.'

     At Highcliff, nearly under Rothsay Castle, both tlie Barton and the Brackles-
 ham series are exposed, the Barton being not more than 10 feet in thickness, and
 the subjacent Bracklesham 40 feet. The section is revealed to the sea-level, and there-

 fore liighly instructive. The Highcliff sands conformably underlie the Barton and
 Hordwell series at an angle of 2░ to the E. The remarkable promontorv of
 Hengistbiu-y Head is mainly composed of strata contemporaneous with the Brack-
 lesham series ; these Mr. Gardner would for convenience call the1 Bournemouth
 beds. Hengistbury promontory in shape resembles a parallelogram obliquely trun-

 cated at its northern extremity. The cliffs facing the sea on the south are" about
 50 feet high, increasing to 100 feet on the north, both presenting bold escarpments
 to the sea. 'The succession of the strata at Hengistbury Head, reading upwards,

 comprises, 1, the Boscombe sands ; 2, a lower series of sand with green grains, and
 an upper bed with ironstone ; and 3, the white Highcliff sand. The white sands

 at Highcliff are 30 feet thick, being 12 feet thinner than the equivalent beds

at Alum Bay, where they measure about 42 feet.' The lowest series in the cliffs

 at the headland Mr. Gardner terms the 'Boscombe sands,' which without any
 doubt represents the chief mass of brilliantly coloured sands, about 750 feet thick,

at Alum Bay, known to all explorers of the island. These coloured sands are
numbered 25 and 26 in Professor Prestwich's section of the vertical beds in Alum

Bay.3 Mr. Gardner also notices another hill similar in contour to that of Hengist-
bury, about three miles to the north of the Head. This, St. Catherine's Hill,

possesses, like the headland, similar physical features, being flat-topped and having
abrupt escarpments on all sides, and 160 feet high. Both the Highcliff sand and
the Hengistbury beds occur in this hill, showing their connection and continuity

inland with the coast section. ' The correlation of the Hengistburv Head series
on the mainland with those of Alum Bay across the Solent admits of little doubt,
and they would appear to be represented at Alum Bay by the HujhcUf sands, 25

feet in thichiess, and equivalent to bed No. 28 in Professor Prestwich's section.

The Hengistbury Head beds appear to be the equivalents of bed No. 27 in the
Alum Bay section. The Boscombe sands represent beds No. 26 and 25 of Prest-
wich in Alum Bay, where they are 150 feet thick. It can be conclusively seen,
from examination of the cliffs in the Bay from Hengistbury to Bournemouth, that
there is a general sequence, and that the 'strata have an amount of dip or inchna-

tion sufficient^ in so extended a distance, to expose two complete series of beds,
the upper series being the continuation of the Boscombe estuarine sands, 100 feet
thick, and the lower series of sands and clavs, of marine origin, which Mr. Gardner
has provisionally termed the Bournemouth marine beds.' With Mr. Gardner's
paper in hand the most minute details of the coast may be followed,' from the

I must therefore refer you to, as givdng step by step an analysis of the structure of
the cliffs, and the flora contained in the clays and sandy series of which they are

composed. This flora of the Bournemouth marine beds may be referred to the Middle

Bagshot series, and the Bracklesham division, possiblj' representing the same stage
in the London basin, and it would appear from careful consideration of the Middle
and Upper Bagshots that no Eocene beds younger than the Bracklesham are met

with in the London area, a geological fact of much significance as compared with
the complete succession of the Eocene series as developed in the Hampshire basin,

and that of their equivalents in the basin of Paris. Mr. Gardner believes that
' the fossil plant remains of the Bournemouth beds, especially those in the marine
series, are of the same age as those in the Bovey Tracey deposits, which have been
wrongly assigned to the Miocene period, believing, in I'act that they are simply an

outlier of the Bournemouth series, now 80 mUes to the west,' but formerly and
originally connected as a western extension of the Bournemouth deposits.

     Comparison of the flora of the two areas shows a close affinity, if not identity
of species, Osmunda lignata, Laatrcea Bunburyi, Palmacites damonorops, the
fruits, conifers, and dicotyledons being not only specifically identical, but occur
in the same combinations and manner of preservation,' loc. cit. pp. 227, 228. Poly-
podium, Chrysodium, Pteris, and Osmunda, amongst the ferns ; Eucalyptus, brandies
of Sequoia, pods and leaves of the Leguminosae, Nipadites, Dryandra, Cacti, Anona,
Hightea, &c. occur in the beds constituting the western termination of the Bourne-
mouth marine series. The fauna testifies to its marine derivation by the genus Ostrea,
Area, Modiola, Tellina, Calyptroea, Phorus, Natica, and Cerithiiim. The Crustacea,
through Callianassa, and a shore crab, with Bryozoa (Flustra), need no other com-
ment. The changing physical characters of the beds of the Bournemouth series,
both horizontally and vertically, the marshy character of the flora, * as represented
by the ferns, aroids. Eucalyptus, &c., the patches of clay, in which the water-plants,

ferns, &c. may have rooted, the local patches of ironstone, the intercalated marine

beds and their fauna, mingled with unios, clearly shows that this was the debateable
ground between sea and river, beyond which to the west it would appear the sea
never then penetrated.' In February of the present year, Mr. Gardner communi-
cated to the Geological Society his second paper on these Bournemouth beds, being
a continuation of his former notice, but in this his researches are confined to the
history of the ' Lower or Freshwater Series ' и of the Bournemouth area. The
author describes the geological structure of the Eocene clifis as far as Poole harbour.
All the strata between Bournemouth and Poole harbour are of freshwater origin,
and highly interesting on account of the fossil flora recently obtained from them by

--Mr. Gardner undoubtedly the most extensive, richest, and most varied hitherto

discovered or extracted from the Tertiary formations. No less than nineteen species

of ferns have been described from these beds. Only ten species have been met with
in all the other British Eocene deposits, including the famous Bovey Tracey beds,
and three of these ten are also found at Bournemouth. Sir C. Lyell, in 1827, the
Rev. P. B. Brodie, in 1842, Mantell, in 1844, Prof. Prestwich, in 1847, Trimmer, in

1855, De la Harpe, in 1856, and Heer, in 1859, have all written upon the flora

and its associated conditions, origin, &c. In 1862, the Geological Survey, through
the Memoir by Forbes and Bristow upon the Isle of Wight, held the view that the

fossil flora of Bournemouth, Corfe, and Alum Bay, were identical, although few
species were common to these localities. * The cUAb comprising the Bournemouth

freshwater series extend from Poole harbour on the west, to beyond Bourne-
mouth, and present escarpments averaging about 100 feet in height, composed of
yellow, white, orange and black sands and clays, crowned with fir-trees or pine

woods.'

     Mr. Gardner places these Bournemouth beds in the Middle Bagshots, drawing
the line between these and the Lower Bagshots at the pipe-clay beds of Corfe, Stud-

land, and Alum Bay in tlie Isle of Wight. This line of division is drawn on account

of the great dissimilarity of the flora contained in each. The Bournemouth flora,

which is distinct from the older, or Alum Bay series, passes up into the so-called

                   ' Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, vol. xxxviii. p. 1.
                            TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.         513

Oligocene without anj' perceptible change or break; but few, or none, of the same

species pass down or occur with the Alum Bay beds.
     These Middle Bagshots are represented in Alum Bay by the unfossiliferous

beds marked 10 to 24 in Professor Prestwich's section,^ and are 240 feet thick.

Palseontologically, these beds may be correlated with the continental Eocenes, pro-
bably those of Aix-la-Chapelle. The cliffs fronting the sea may be divided into
three groups. The first extends from Poole Harbour to Bateman's Chine, the

second group extends from the Sugar-loaf Chine to Watering Chine, the third
section or group extends from AVatering Chine to the Bourne Valley.^ The chief
interest attached to the Bournemouth beds is the flora distributed chiefly through

the ' Lower or FresMcater Series.' None of the prevailing Alum Bay types are found
at Bournemouth, nor are any of the well-known Bournemouth types found at Alum

Bay, and according to Mr. Gardner, their affinities are completely with the floras
ascribed in France to the Oligocene, and the forms of flora as at present known,
chiefly Australian and tropical American.

     The author has endeavoured to show that ' a great river existed throughout the
whole of Eocene times, bringing deposits from the westward, and that the Bourne-
mouth cliffs present a section across its bed, these deposits being formed during a
continued period of subsidence.' ' The sudden change observed in the beds from
fine to coarse sediment, and the thickness of the deposit, cannot be explained by the
floods and freshets incidental to changing seasons, but are such as would occur
whenever subsidence exceeded, in however trifling a degree, the silting up power

of the river,' loc. cit. p. 13.

     It is a question of importance whether the continental floras similar to our own

at Bournemouth have been correctly determined. ' For while all the strata that
have yielded dicotyledonous leaves or fruits below our Headon series are admitted
to be Eocene, scarcely any of the beds on the Continent resembling them are
ascribed to that age,' but to the Miocene. ' For as all Eocene floras approximate
more or less to Miocene, it has been a kind of rule in the absence of stratigraphical

evidence, to assume that all isolated patches with dicotyledons, belonged to the
latter period,' and had the stratigraphical evidence at Bournemouth been incon-

clusive, the whole of that Eocene formation must also upon plant evidence (for we

have no other) have been classed as Miocene.
     The Ldwer Freshiuater series is seen in the neighbourhood of Corfe and some

parts of the cliffs at Studland. It is characterised by abimdance of pipe-clays, and
IS about 200 feet thick.

     The Middle Freshwater sei-ies also occurs at Corfe and Studland, and forms
the whole thickness of the cliffs between Poole Harbour and Bournemouth, thus
constituting a fine section, 4 miles long and 100 feet in height.

     The next series is marine, and about 400 to 500 feet thick. This marine group
occupies the cliffs between Boscombe and High Cliff".

     The Bournemouth flora appears to consist principally of trees or hardwood shrubs,
few remains of herbaceous plants being preserved. The ferns are rare in the lower
part of the series, but become more abundant, almost to the exclusion of other

vegetation, towards the close of the middle period.
     The prevailing group appears to be that of Acrostichum, of which there were

many species. Aru/iopteris, Nephrodium, Gleichenia, and Lyffodium, and other

undescribed forms occur.

    Among the Coniferte, Cupressus, Taxodium, and Dacridium, with indications of

pinus. The Cycadse seem to have disappeared.
     The monocotyledons are well represented by reeds and rushes. Nipadites

represents the screw pines. The palms are very abundant, especially in the lower-
most beds of Corfe and Studland and the upper middle beds of Bournemouth;
many Flahellaria, Sabal, and Phtenicites occur; the Smilacese occur in all the
foasiliferous beds, and are represented by five or six species.

                     Isle of Wight.

     The present rhomboidal form or configuration of the Isle of Wight is due partly

to the unequal action of the sea on its coast line, and partly to those disturbances
or movements which have thrown some of its strata into the positions exhibited at

Scratchell's Bay, Alum Bay, and Whiteclift' I'ay.
     The rapid waste of the clifl's going on at Sandown and Freshwater Baj-s is due

to the action of the sea, the Lower Greensand and Wealden strata there exposed

beino- more easily destroyed than the chalk.

     The leading physical feature in the structure of the Isle of AVight consists in
the ridge of high and bare clialk downs near tlie centre of the island extending from
the Needles on the west to Culver Clift' on the east. Another chalk range parallel

to the former, but on the south of the island, extends from St. Catherine's Down on
tbe west to Boniface Down on the east. In the space occupied between these two

chalk ranges (upper cretaceous rocks), there occurs the complete succession of the

lower cretaceous and lacustrine Wealden groups, comprising the Hastings sand and
Weald clay exposed at Compton Bay and Ilock Point on the west, and Sandown
Bay on the eastern side. The central ridge is depressed and cut through by trans-
verse valleys ; such occur at Freshwater Gate, Shalcombe, Calbourn, and by the
Carisbrook, Medina, and Brading valleys. ' A.\\ these breaks may possibly be on

lines of faults running or cutting through at right angles to the strike of the

chalk.'

     The part of the Isle of Wight which lies to the north of the central chalk
range is entirely composed of the older Tertiary or Eocene strata. The only
fault of magnitude known in the island is that occurring along the line of the

Medina valley. Those on the eastern side of the river are the Ileadon, Osborne,
and St. Helen's series. The rocks at West Cowes, or west of the Medina, belong

to the Bembridge marls or fluvio-marine series. ' From the known thickness of the
several groups the amount of displacement which takes place on the line of fault
between East and West Cowes, or along the line of the Medina, cannot be less than

200 feet.'

  IThe longitudinal undulations aflecting or disturbing the Tertiary strata north of

the chalk ridges are less obvious than those above described. The chief flexures
which are in immediate sequence with the chalk are exhibited both at Whitecliff"

and Alum Bays, where the Lower and Middle Tertiaries are inclined at very high

angles.

     The first set, or the east and west undulations, are connected with the movement
that elevated the chalk vertically. The north and south undulations also aflectthe
chalk, since each north and south valley formed by the synclinal curve or hollow of
the roll, corresponds to the division between the two chalk downs, and each down
to an anticlinal. All the Lower Tertiary strata, including the fluvio-marine beds, are

aflected by these movements.

     ' Mr. Gardner has been greatly aided in his floral researches by Baron Constantin
Ettingsbausen, Ph.D., who has brought to bear his great knowledge of fossil plants
and their distribution through the higher Tertiaries. The joint monograph by Messrs.
Gardner and Ettingsbausen on the ' British Eocene Flora,' in the Palieontographical
Society's volumes for 1879 is of the highest value to Palasobotanical students.

     The gravel beds, which rest upon the older Tertiary strata, whether the oldest or
higher level gravels, or the newer, siicli as those which occupy the comhes and
transverse valleys, are unnifected by these movements, showing that their origin is
subsequent to the disturbing forces which affected the Secondarv and Tertiary rocks
below them or on which they rest.

                     LoAVER Tertiakt Strata of the Isle of "Wight.

     The Lower and Middle Eocene strata of the Isle of Wight, especially up to the

mbase of the fluvio-marine series, may be better studied in the cliffs Alum Bay and

Whitecliff Bay than in any other part of the island.

     In these remarkable sections the whole of the strata from the chalk to the fluvio-
mariue formation are displayed in unbroken succession.

                                 Plastic Clay.

' The lowest member of this group of strata in the Isle of Wight is the Plastic

Clay, or Woolwich and Reading series of Mr. Prestwich.' These beds are best ex-
amined in Whitecliff Bay and Alum Baj-, especially the former, where the mottled

beds are well exposed. No fossils have'occurred in the plastic clay of the island.

Seven beds have been recognised, the whole measuring So feet ; they constitute a

narrow belt striking across the island, resting on the chalk.

The London clay succeeds the plastic clay, and also forms a narrow belt extending

across the island from the west coast at Alum Bay to the east at Whitecliff or
ACulver Cliff; its thickness is about HOO feet.
                                                 baud of flint pebbles only 2 inches

thick diA-ides the plastic clay from the London clay, representing the basement bed

of Mr. Prestwich. Nowhere in Britain can the London clay be so advantageously

studied as at Whitecliff Bay, or where the characteristic fossils are better exposed.

Twenty-five to thirty characteristic species may be collected here. Amongst others
may be named Pinna affinis, Pectimculus hrevtrostris, I'holadomya margaritacea,

Panopea intermedia, and Modiola elegans. The annelide Bitrupa 2}lana belono-s

                                 Lozver Bcif/shot Beds.

     Joshua Trimmer, in 1850, first applied the term Bagshot to the whole series of

strata in Alum Bay and Whiteclifl" Bay, dividing it into upper, middle, and lower,

thus correlating it with the corresponding series in the London area which had'

been previously established by Professor Prestwich.

     The Lower Bagshot beds are greatly developed in the Isle of Wight, attaining
a thickness in Alum Bay of 660 feet, the most important genera being Elfeodendron

Taxites, Quercus, Juglans, Daphnogene, Laurus, Caesalpinia, Cassia, Ficus, Dryandra^

Rhamnus and Sabal, &c. They comprise a series of variously-coloured unfossili-

ferous sands and clays, with accompanying iron-sandstone and clay. These last

beds are in one place crowded with the leaves of sub-tropical land plants illustrating

no less than 19 families, 26 genera, and about 50 species : the Araliace<e, Casua-

rinacece, Celmtracece, Coniferce, Cornacecp, Cnnoniace(e, Cujndifera, Cycad<e,Ebenace<2

Euphorhincece, Jur/landcB, Laurinem, Lef/uminoso', Mor'ece, Pnbnce, Proteacem,

Rhamnm, SapindacecB, and Tiliacem. The same strata at Bournemouth and Corfe

Castle in Dorsetshire exhibit an identical but also richer flora. Out of the great series

found at Bournemouth through the researches of Mr. J. Gardner, fifteen or

sixteen species occur in the pipe-clays of Alum Baj'. As a whole they indicate a
rather high temperature. The flora of the Lower Miocene beds, well" known in

Central Europe, has some affinities with that of our Hampshire basin.

The tropical or sub-tropical character of the London clay plants was long ago

worked out by Dr. Bowerbank, but it was reserved for Dr. Dela Harpeto carry his

comparison into the Middle Eocene beds, and to show that there had been only a

moderate decrease of temperature, so far as plants could show, in the time occupied '

by the deposition of the Bagshot or Bracklesham sands. The marine fauna of th^ '

same  period  fully  bears out  this conclusion, there   being  no  essential                                                                                          '

                                                                               difi'erence

between the fossils of the London clay and those of the Bagshot, or even the

Barton beds, which would indicate a marked change of climate.

516 EEPORT-- 1882.

     The flora of the Aliiin Bay beds is especially distinguished by the number and
Tariety of its Leguminosse. The plant-contents of the Lower Bagshot beds of Alum
Bay approximate to that of the London clay by the predominance of plants of this
family, forty-seven species of which were obtained by Mr. Bowerbauk.

     The junction between the London clay and the Lower Bagshot is clearly seen
in Whitecliff Bay, the brown ferruginous clay representing the former, and the

latter being represented by pale grey or white sands about 40 feet thick. In the

640 feet of these Lower Bagshot beds at Alum Bay no other fossils are known

ihan plants, and about 60 species occur.

Middle Bagshot Series.

Bracklesham Beds,

The strata comprised between the sands at the base of Headon Hill, and the

pipe-clay bearing sands and clays (Lower Bagshots), overlying the London clay,

are subdivided into Barton clay and Bracklesham beds. The Bracklesham beds in

Alum Bay are represented by clays and marls in the lower part, and by white,

jellow, and crimson sands above. The lower beds are remarkable for the quantity

of lignites, coaly or vegetable matter contained in them, constituting beds from

35 inches to 2 feet in thickness. The black and coal-like appearance of four of

these beds are conspicuous and marked objects in the clifi", and determine the

position of the Bracklesham series.

The uppermost beds of the series, or the yellow, white, and crimson sands, are

Hnfossiliferous. At Whitecliff Bay the lower part of the Bracklesham beds are

green, clayey sands, containing Venericardia planicosta, Turritella iinbricataria, and

ANummiilif.es Icevif/atus. Six zones of fossils are there recognised.    hard bed of

conglomerate composed of rounded flint pebbles in a ferruginous cement is also

a marked feature in the cliffs at Alum Bay, defining the division between the

&acklesham beds and the overlying Barton clay.

                                                      Barton Clay.

     The Barton series, composed of sandy clays and sands with layers of septaria,

K sufficiently shown in Alum Bay, where it attains a thickness of 300 feet, and is

Tich in fossil remains, the whole of which are marine ; 48 genera and 90 species of

mollusca alone have occurred at Alum Bay.
    At Barton Cliff, on the mainland, or opposite coast of Hampshire, a rich and

abundant marine molluscan fauna occurs. The lower beds at Alum Bay contain

Voluta luctatrix, Rimelln {Rostellarin) rimosa, Conus or Conorbis dormitor, and
J'usus longavm, with Crassatella sulcata, &c.

Upper Bagshot Sands.

    These are the unfossiliferous sands below the Lower Headon beds, used
extensively for glass-making, which may be 160 feet thick at Alum Bay. In

Whitecliff Bay the junction between the Upper Bagshot sands and the Barton

day is sharp and well-defined ; a few casts of fossils occur here, but in so friable

a state that they cannot be removed.

    Examination of the clitts at Alum Bay will at once show that the strata from

the chalk to the Upper Bagshots are highly inclined, caused by the force that

produced the anticlinal axis which traverses the island east and west, and this

axis brings to the surface the Wealden beds in Brixton and Sandown Bays, thus

revT'alinn' the extent and continuity of the Wealden series, and determining its

presence westward in the Isle of Purbeck along the same east and west line of

elevation. Eastward of the Isle of Wight this axis is lost under the waters of the

English Channel, and we have no visible proof of its influence towards Beachy

Head ; it may have aided in preparing a weakened line for the course of the

Phannel towards the Straits of Dover. These beds at Hordwell Cliff have been

the subject of a notice by Mr. Tawney in the ' Proceedings of the Cambridge

myPhilosophical Society,' and will be referred to in the latter part of  address.

north, in Oolwell Bay, the upper and lower beds contain brackish-water shells ; but

the central part assumes a distinctly marine character. Ostrea velata, S. Wood, is a

characteristic species with numerous marine genera, many of which are of Barton

types. This central part is known as the ' Venus bed,'' from the presence of

Cytherea incrassata. The marine character of the Middle Headon beds is still more

strongly marked at Whiteclift'Bay (22 genera). The lower portion of this series

at Whiteclift" Bay contains many Brockeuhurst species, but at Colwell Bay we have

no evidence of characteristic species from this last horizon, or in the western side

of the island.

Loicer Headons, fresh and brackish-water series.
These beds are 70 feet thick in Totland Bav, and 40 feet thick in Whitecliff

Bay.
     They consist of fresh and brackish-water beds abounding in fossils resembling

those of the upper division. Unio Solandri and Cyrena cycladiformis occur here
and are characteristic.

    At Headon Hill the thick bed of limestone in the Upper Headon is conspicuous

in the clift's, but it thins out rapidly towards the north and disappears in an easterly

direction. The Lower Headon contains a much less thick limestone at Headon Hill,

and it is represented by tlie band forming How Ledge between Colwell and Totland

Bays. 120 species have been obtained from the Headon series : 104 mollusca, 9

Crustacea, 4 annelids, and 3 plants. Land, freshwater, and marine the fossils of the

     Between the Bembridge limestone and the brackish-water beds with Potor
momyce, that terminate the Headon beds, a considerable series of strata intervenes,
which on accomit of their mineralogical and palseontological peculiarities, deserve
to hold an intermediate position between the middle and upper Eocene strata, and

have been named the Osborne Series. Among the fossils are Paludijice {P. lenta),
Melanice (M. costata, M. excaiiata), Melanopsis hrevis and M. carinata. Chara

Lyellii is the Gyrogonite of the limestone band, which on the east side divides the
Upper or St. Helen's sands from the Lower or Nettlestone beds. The difference
between the upper and lower portions of them is considerable.

     Between Brading Harbour and Rj'de, sections occur, and on shore are seen the

                              Flttvio-maeine Series.

Of the fluvio-marine strata of the Isle of Wight, the Bemhridge series is by far

the most constant in lithological characters. The lower part is calcareous (marine
and freshwater). The upper part (largest) consists of alternations of marls and

laminated clays.

    By far the larger portion of the Tertiary surface of the Isle of Wight is occupied

by the beds of the Bembridge series, which overlies the Headon Hill group. Stra-

tigraphically, or in a scientific point of view, they possess high interest, being

representatives of extensive continental fortnations, through whicli we are enabled

to correlate or at least throw considerable light on the classification of foreign

Tertiary strata.

    Through these Bembridge strata we are also made acquainted with and acquire
much information respecting the terrestrial fauna of our own area during the later

portion of the Eocene epoch.

Palneontologically, the Upper Bembridge marls are characterised by the abundance

of Melania turritissima . These marls are finely shown in Whitecliff Bay, on the
shore at Hempstead, and at Thorness, containing Cyrena pulchra.

The upper beds of the second group are exposed in the clearest manner through

fine sections at the same places, and also at, or near Brading harbour, below St,

Helen's. Remains of Trionyx, or the fresh-water tortoise, large Cerithia (C. variabile),

and Cyrena pulchra characterise these beds.

     Tlie third group, or the Bembridge oyster-beds, forms a narrow but constant
band between tlie marls and the limestones. Marine conditions set in here,

characterised by the abundance ofOstren vectensis,Kucula similis,Cytherea incrassata,

Mytihis, and Cerithimn. These beds were long mistaken for the ' upper marine' or

Middle Headon strata. At Whiteclifl" Bay and Brading harbour this group may

be advantageously studied.

The fourth subdivision, or Bembridge limestone, includes those beds exhibited

at Binsted, Cowes, Calbourn, and Sconce (but not the limestones of the Headon

series). It is important to remember this when correlating the British Upper Eocene

deposits with those of the Continent.

This remarkable limestone in Whiteclijf Bay forms a conspicuous feature in the

Whencliifs ; it is also the marked feature at Bembridge ledge.  closely inspected

it is found to be composed of a number of distinct beds or strata. In ascending

order we readily recognise se\'en divisions, each characterised by freshwater moUusca

and some few land plants.

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  519

                     Recent Classifications op the Upper Eocenes.

     Professor Judd, in a paper communicated to the Geological Society in May, 1880,
on the Oligocene strata of the Hampshire basin, having reference to the beds at
Headon Hill and Colwell Bay, in the Isle of Wight, endeavoured to show that tlis
Colwell Bay marine beds are not, as has been hitherto supposed, the equivalents of
those of Headon Hill and Hordwell Clifi", but that they occupy a distinct and much
higher horizon in the Eocene series. Assuming this to be the case, a new classifica-
tion and nomenclature for the Upper Eocene series of Britain was proposed by the

author.'

     Professor Judd traced tlie liistory of previous opinion upon the succession of the
Tertiary strata down to the time of Professor Edward Forbes and the Geological
Survey, with the subsequent labours of Mr. Bristow. Edward Forbes confirmed tlie
previous determinations of Professor Prestwich in his elaborate researches in the Isle
of Wight Tertiaries. Forbes's life, however, was not spared to enable him to com-
plete his researches in this division of the British strata; his attention was chiefly
confined to the four uppermost Eocene members, or the Hempstead, Bembridge,
Osborne and St. Helen's, and tlie Headon beds. These divisions were accepted and
worlied upon as a basis by the Geological Survey. With regard to these strata,
Forbes maintained, as almost all previous observers had done, that the beds at Colwell
and Totland Bays are on the same horizon as those at the base of Headon Hill
and at Hordwell Clifl'.

     Professor Judd's view has been questioned and refuted by Messrs. Tawnej^ and
Keeping, in an elaborate paper also read before the Geological Society in May, 1881,^
and in a subsequent communication to the Cambridge Philosophical Society in the

same year, ' On the Beds at Headon Hill and Colwell Bay in the Isle of Wight.'
     The importance of a correct reading and classification of these Middle Eocene

strata in the Isle of Wight, and their correlation with beds of the same age in
France, Belgium,'and Germany, cannot be overlooked or over-estimated, and often as
it has been attempted, the papers by the two above-named authors have still greatly
added to our knowledge of the stratigraphy of the Eocene series of the Isle of Wight
It is impossible to dispute the validity of their researches and value of their sec-
tions. The publication of Mr. Judd's paper disputing the correctness of Forbes's
work and tliat of the Geological Survey, and the proposal of a fresh classification,
drew immediate attention to the labours of the older authors, but especially that by

the Geoliigical Survey^wliich was answerable for the latest, indeed the only known
extended and complete analysis of the Upper Eocene strata of the Isle of Wight.

   We owe a debt of gratitude to the late Mr. F. Edwards and Mr. S. V. Wood,

for their valuable additions to our knowledge of the palreontology of the fauna of
the fluvio-mariue beds of the Hampshire basin. Since the publication of Professor
Forbes's memoir upon the Isle of Wight, the molluscan fauna alone is at least three
times as great as noticed by him, and since that time the remarkable fauna of

Brockenhurst in the New Forest, discovered by Mr. Edwards, has been carefully

studied by Von Konen for the mollusca, and Professor Duncan for tlie corals. These
naturalists have shown the agreement of this fauna with that of the Lower

Oligocene in North Germany. This Brockenhurst fauna is also identical with cer-
tain strata at the base of the IMiddle Headon beds at Whitecliff Bay, in the Isle of
Wight.

     Professor Judd in his paper describes the stratigraphical position of the Colwell
Bay and Headon Hill beds, and their relation to each other, pointing out what
he believed to have been an error on Forbes's part, relative to the correlation of the
' "S'enus bed ' at the two places, in what is really a continuous section : Edward
Forbes and the Geological Survey having carefully and correctly determined that
only one set of marine strata occurred between the two brackish or estuarine and
freshwater series. This fact has been again most carefully worked out by Messrs.
Tawney and Keeping, leaving no doubt as to the inter|n-etation and accuracy of the
work of Forbes and the Sun'ey, and establishing upon a firmer basis the continuity

and equivalency of the Colwell Bay and Headon Hill marine series, througli the
* Venus bed,' all being stratigraphically and palseontologically the same. Professor
Judd insists upon 250 feet of strata intervening between the Bembridge limestone
and the marine band of Headon Hill, but Forbes and the Geological Survey in
their section show less than one-half of that thickness. Recent research contirms
this view. At pp. 148-150, the author also endeavours to show that the palfeonto-

logical evidence is in accordance with, and as complete as the stratigraphical.
This of course is based upon the belief that both are read or interpreted rightly.
The comparison is between the collective fauna of "WhiteclifF, Colwell Bay, and
Brockenhurst on the one hand, and Headon Hill and Hordwell on the other hand
but Messrs. Keeping and Tawney have shown the illogical nature of conclusions
drawn from such an admixture of beds. Each bed should be compared separately.

     Professor Judd (on pp. 150-164) correlates the British fluvio-marine strata
with that of the Continent, adding at p. 153 of this paper a list of his so-called
Brockenhurst species from "\Miitecliff ]3ay, Colwell Bay, Brockenhurst, and Lynd-
hurst, with those species common to the Barton beds below and Hempstead series
above. This so-called Brockenhurst, but i-eally Middle Headon fauna, numbers 84
genera, and 187 species (65 of which are manuscript names). Four of the 13 c6rals
of the Brockenhurst beds also occur in the Oligoceue strata of North Germany.
This conclusion was arrived at by Professor Duncan, independently of the work

of Von Konen upon the mollusca in the same beds.^ The author also prepared
a list of the Hempstead or so-called Middle Oligocene fauna, in which no less
than 40 genera and 101 species are named ; 40 of these are manuscript names,
by Mr. F. Edwards, thus reducing the described fauna to 61 species. The sub-

division and nomenclature of the series is next given, and the author proposed to
extend the ' name of the Headon series, so as to embrace all the beds between the

Barton and the Brockenhurst series, and to call all those strata said to belong to
the zone of Ce)-ithium concavum the Headon group,' doing away with the smaller
subdivision of Lower, Middle, and Upper. To all the beds between the Brocken-
hurst and Hempstead series Mr. Judd would apply the name Bembridge group

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

including the series both above and below the ' Bembridge series of Edward Forbes,
and also beds referred by him to the base of the Hempstead, the Osborne and
St. Helen's, and to the Upper Headon.' Such a proposal labours under the
error of altogether failing to recognise the position which the Brockenhurst fauna
occupies in this interesting series. Professor Judd in fact places the Brockenhurst
beds not only above the Middle Headon, but above the Upper Headon and Osborne
beds of Headon Hill. It occupies, however, in fact, a place at the base of the

Middle Headon, as is well seen at Whitecliff Bay, and at Brockenhurst itself.
     This change in the nomenclature and classification has not met with approba-

tion, and is strongly opposed by Messrs. Tawney and Keeping in their exhaustive

paper, and by Mr. Lucas in his communication to the 'Geological Magazine."^
Messrs. Keeping and Tawney elaborately defend the labours and views of the Geo-
logical Survey, giving a mass of evidence, both as to the order of the strata and the
distribution of life-forms, clearl}- showing that the relations of the whole group can

be determined by examination of the continuity of the Colwell Bay and Headon
Hill beds, and that the brackish-marine beds of Colwell Bay coiTespond with the
brackish-marine beds of Headon Hill in every essential particular, being, in fact,
one continuous and imbroken sequence, as laid down by the Geological Survey
this the authors have again clearly demonstrated in the text of their Memoir, and
laid down in their clear and continuous section from Clirt" End or Lynchen Chine
to near Alum Bay Chine, and synthetically proved in their vertical sections.

     The following general and condensed description or analysis of the Headon
series of Colwell Bay and Headon Hill, as given by Messrs. Tawney and Keeping,
will aid those wishing to examine the section, prior to reading or possessing them-

selves of the original papei- in the ' Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society,'

   --Vertical Section at the North-east Corner of Hendon Hill. One hundred and

ten feet of strata occur from the top of the Bemhridge limestone to the top of the

Great Limestone (Upper Headon). The Brockenhurst series does not exist
here. Not a single marine fossil occurs in that interval. Nor is there any bed

having the least resemblance either lithologically or palaeontologically to the

Colwell Bay Venus bed.

The Upper Headon at Headon Hill measures 50 feet, and contains the thick

Lymnsean limestone (27 feet). The united or combined thickness of the Osborne

and Upper Headon beds (Geological Survey) is 119 feet, i.e. adopting the top of

the Cerithimn ventricosum bed as the boundary. The Osborne beds at Headon

HiU are below the Bembridge limestone and extend up to it, so there is no room

--for a greater thickness of beds.
    The Middle Headon. The uppermost and lower portions of the Middle Headon

are brackish-water beds abounding in Cerlthinm ventricosum, C. pseudocinctum,

C. concavum, Neritina concava, and NemnturcB. The beds or series in Headon Hill

richest in Cytherea incrassata (Venus bed proper), exhibit identically the same

fossils as at Colwell Bay.

Below the oyster band in grey sandy clays is the Venus bed, extremely rich in

marine fossils. Cytherea, Mya, Maetra, Corbicida, Nucula, Triyonocoelia, Fusus,

MyaCancellaria, Voluf.a, Vicarya, and Natica ;  umjtistata and Cytherea incrassata

scattered throughout and abiuidant. The Middle Headon of Headon Hill is 32 feet

thick. The Survey vertical section gives 35 feet for the same boundaries. The

height of the Middle Headon above the sea-level at the north-east end is 72 feet,

--and not below the sea-level, as seems required on Professor Judd's theory.
    Lower Headon. The first bed is a Lymnsean limestone, and is the same well-

known bed which forms the top of the Lower Headon in Warden Olilf. It is

Howtraceable to  Ledge, where it disappears below the sea, and clearly shows by its

Howcourse that it is the    Ledge bed of Warden Cliff. Although this limestone is

denuded from the top of the anticlinal curve between W^eston and Widdick Chines,

some of the lower beds are traceable the whole distance ; accordingly we can join
on the section in Headon Cliff to that in Warden Cliff. This gives a continuous

section and series of beds from the lowest seen of the Lower Headon, through the

Middle and Upper Headon of Colwell Bay to the Bembridge limestone both north

and south. There is therefore only one marine {Middle Headon) series lying

between two freshwater series, or ' the Lower and Upper Headon.' The E-ev.

0. Fisher has discovered the Venus bed in the Totland Bay brickyard, some short

distance above and behind the top of the cliff, between the chines. This being the

only part where it is missing from the cliff is proof of its continuity from Warden

Cliff to the north-east corner of Headon Hill.

The authors describe in the most careful manner the Lower Headon beds of the

cliffs between Weston and Widdick Chines, much of the space in which is hidden

--by the grass slopes, but the connection cannot be doubted.
     The Lower Hendon of Warden Cliff.- ' The lowest beds of this series are seen
below the Totland Bay Hotel at Weston Chine, and all are below the Venus bed.

A remarkable feature in the lowest portion are five thin Lymnsean limestones, con-

taining chara seeds. These five limestones at low water form ^\e submarme ledges

parallel to the great ledge at Warden cliff' (Warden ledge). Above these five beds

and the sands containing Potamomya comes the concretionary calcareous sand rock

which forms AVarden Ledge. It crops out at the top of the cliff below the flagstafi"

of the coastguard station. Succeeding these is the tJnio bed (^U. Sohmdri) which is

Howassociated with Melania turritissimn. The    Ledge limestone succeeds and forms

the summit of the Lower Headon series. This limestone is denuded away in the
centre of Totland Bay, where we have evidence and may infer the summit of the

anticlinal to be near the old wooden pier. The thickness of the Lower Headon in

Warden cliff is 72 feet, and from that to 87 feet before reaching the yellow sands

of the Upper Bagshot.

The whole of tlie cliffs between Weston and Widdick Chines are occupied solely

and throughout by Lower Headon beds, and the Colwell Bay marine bed extends

Headon Hill, is abundant above the part richest in Cytherea. This oyster occurs

in vast abundance in the centre of the bay between Colwell and Bramble Chines,

crowding out other fossils and forming a massive oyster bank about 20 feet thick.

Having noticed the stratigraphical succession of the several divisions in the

beds at Headon Hill and Colwell Bay, I now proceed to draw attention to the

distribution of the fossils.

The authors of the paper have discussed the question as to whether the

Colwell Bay has any more affinity with the Brockenhurst fauna, than has the

Headon   Hill   bed                       and  they  compare  the  fauna                                                                                   both  of  the  Colwell  Bay  and
                                       ;

Headon Hill marine beds. This they do by separating in tabular form the

fauna of all the localities which are to be compared togetlier. The splendid

collection of Tertiary fossils belonging to the late Mr. F. Edwards, and now in the

British Museum, has formed the basis of their comparison, while their own researches

have added occurrences still more conclusive as to the correlation of species in

the areas imder examination and consideration. The authors obtained during

their research in the Isle of AVight many species in the marine bed at Headon

Hill which do not exist in the Edwards collection from that locality. ' The test

as to the contemporaneity of the beds in question is not to be obtained "from the

rarer forms only, but from a comparison of the commoner and more characteristic

species.' No less than fifty-eight species were obtained by the autliors from the

Middle Headon of two localities, Colwell Bay and Headon Hill, nineteen of which

appeared in and came up from the Barton beds, and with seven exceptions all the

fifty-eight forms came from both horizons.

    It has been stated that the ' strata at Colwell Bay are of 2}iirely marine oriyin,
tohile the so-called Middle Marine beds of Headon Hill and Hordwell Cliff' are
of totally different character.' But Messrs. Tawney and Keeping obtained from

the marine series at Colwell Bay the brackish-water genera Cerithium, Cyrena,

Hydrobia, Lymncea, Paludina, Planorbis, Melania, and Melanopsis, although said to

be found only at Headon Hill. It has also been stated that certain species of

Cerithium are confined to Headon Hill, and do not occur in Colwell Bay, and

that through this discovery serious errors in our classification have been detected,

as well as in the correlation of the strata under consideration.

  --The presence of Cerithium concavum in the Venus bed abundantly at Colwell

Bay and we may add from private information from Mr. Keeping that he has

--found it also at Whitecliff Bay in the same position removes all doubt as to the

non-occurrence of the zone in that locality. As has been stated, the species is not

so common at Colwell Bay as at Headon Hill.

There is but one marine bed, and that is known only in the Middle Headon. The

place of the Brockenhurst bed is at the lowest horizon in the Middle Headon, but

it does not appear at Colwell Bay, or anywhere in the west end of the island, but

only at WhitecliflP.
TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  523

  --Middle Headun of Whitecliff Bay. It has been stated that the Colwell Bay bed

is placed iu tlie Brockenhurst, which is said to occupy a higher horizon than the
Headon Hill and Hordwell marine bed. The true place of the Brockenhurst fauna

in the Isle of \^'ight is confined to one zone, and that at the base of the Middle

Headon series, and only at Whitecliff Bay or in the New Forest.

     The Geological Survey do not mention by name the Brockenhurst bed in their
vertical section [Sheet 25] of Whitecliff Bay, as its peculiar fauna had not been

recognised at that time. It is easily identitied, however, in their section as the

basement bed of then- Middle Headon, the whole of which is given as 90 feet

thick.

  --Brockenhurst Zone at Whitecliff Bay. At the time the Geological Survey sec-

tion was made, this bed at Brockenhurst was unknown, and its fauna undescribed.

Subsequent observers have recognised the Brockenhurst fauna in the lowest bed

(2 feet thick) of the Middle Headon at AVhitecliff Bay. 69 species are known

here, and 104 occur at Brockenhurst.

  --Affinities of the Brockenhurst Fauna. If we take the whole Brockenhurst fauna,

including the eighteen corals (special to the zone) we obtain a total of 151 species,

of which from 74 to 81 pass up from Barton.
     Messrs. Tawney and Keeping supply a list of 53 species from the Brockenhurst

zone obtained from the Whitley Eidge Railway Cutting, New Forest. 51 of these

53 forms have occurred in the 2-foot bed at Whitecliff Bay, 27 of which pass up
from the Barton or Bracklesham beds.

     The palseontological evidence therefore accords with the stratigraphical.

29 per cent, of Barton forms in the Colwell Bay bed. In the Brockenhurst bed
the ratio was about 50 per cent., and in the Headon marine bed, 29 per cent. Ex-
amination also of the more characteristic Colwell and Headon marine fossils shows

--that these faunas are practically identical and also shows that only certain Brocken-

hurst species occur at Colwell Bay, and not at Headon Hill. They are Scalaria tessel-
lata and Tellina affinis, this latter a Barton form, while those occurring at Headon
Hni and not at Colwell Bay are Marginella (cstuarina and Cardita paucirostata ; only
' two in each case, which amounts to perfect equality.' If we take into account those
common to the Colwell and Headon marine beds, and not occurrmg at Brockenhurst,
we iind twenty-six species. It is therefore evident that the Brockenhurst fauna is
not identical with that of the Colwell Bay bed, and not newer than that of Headon

Hill.^

     Thus fossil as well as stratigraphical evidence shows that the Colwell Bay bed
is identical with the Headon Middle Marine.

     The same twofold proof demonstrates that the Brockenluirst bed, where present,
lies at the base of the Middle Marine Headon beds, and immediately above the
Lower Headon. This Brockenhurst bed is absent at Colwell Bay and Headon HiU,
but occurs at Whitecliff' Bay, Brockenhurst, and Lyndhurst.

     The proposal by Professor Judd to extend the name of the Headon series so
as to include all the beds between the Barton and Brockenhm-st series, and call
them the 'Headon Group,' woxdd cause great inconvenience. The term Middle
Headon, based as it is on the classical work of Edward Forbes, is clear and de-
finite. Again, it would entail the abandonment of the names Upper and Lower
Headon also; and the non-occurrence of the Brockenhurst series, or its repre-
sentative, in Colwell Bay admits of no recognition on the west side of the island,
and therefore the classitication would be based upon a defective appreciation of

the beds.

     Von Konen, in 1864, justly correlates the fauna, and since then, in 1866, the

coral fauna has been described by Dr. Duncan.
     Messrs. Tawney and Keeping, in their paper on the beds at Headon Hill

and Colwell Bay in the Isle of Wight, uphold the work done by the Geological
Survey, maintaining the correctness and integrity of the two Survey Memoirs, and

the horizontal and vertical sections of the Tertiary beds of the Isle of Wight. Pro-
fessor Judd differs from the identifications and stated succession of the beds in

Totland and Colwell Bays. He introduces two new series at Headon Hdl, a marine
524 KEPORT-- 1882.

and a freshwater (?) in addition to those which have heen universally accepted for

the last twenty-five years.*

The sections prepared by Professor Judd also differ very considerably from that

of the Geological Survey, or those lately prepared by Messrs. Keeping and Tawney,

durijg their late examination of the beds under notice. These are the marine series

known as the Middle Headon or Middle Marine. Prof. Judd places them at the sea-

level near Widdick Chine. Consequently, between the top of the marine bed and

that of the Bembridge limestone, there would be, on Prof. Judd's theory, 250 feet

of beds, such being the altitude of the cottage on the Warren which marks the

summit of the Bembridge limestone. This thickness must, however, be reduced by

100 or 105 feet, which is the altitude of the top of the Middle Headon at this point.

This 105 feet of beds, or anothe?- freshwater and another marine, have no exist-

ence ; they can only be accounted for by counting the Lower and Middle Headon

twice over. Now the only marine beds are those of the Middle Headon, enclosed

between the altitudes of 70 feet above the sea-level ; the others are all freshwater.

The point wherein Professor Judd's section differs from the Survey and

that of the authors, arises from the belief that a second marine series, termed the

* Brockenhurst series,' with another freshwater below, in all 105 feet, is intercalated

--above the Upper Ileadon these two beUeved new formations having that portion

of the section allotted to them which is occupied by the freshwater Osborne marls

and part of the Upper Headon. It must be remembered that there is no positive

evidence of the existence of this second marine {Brockenhurst) series at the spot

where the Geological Survey places the Osborne marls. Careful examination fails

to reveal these said-to-be additional beds. It is clear, therefore, that no bed having

the peculiar fauna of the Brockenhurst bed occurs at the west end of the island ; its

place too, if found, would be at the base of the Middle Headon and not above the

Upper, where it has been wrongly assigned. Messrs. Keeping and Tawney, in their

paper, object to the correlation of the Brockenhurst with the Colwell Bay bed

which is identical with the marine (Middle Headon) bed of Ileadon Hill. Thus the

105 feet of strata have no existence.

The Middle Headon, which is denuded away from the top of the cliffs in the

centre of Totland Bay between Weston and Widdick Chines, has been discovered

in the Totland Bay brickyard, which lies a little inland of this portion of the cliff,

thus conclusively showing that this bed was continuous above the top of the cliff,

consequently linking the Warden Cliff exposure to that of Headon Hill. They are

visibly and absolutely continuous with those of Colwell Bay.

  --Falceontological Evidence. The equivalency of the Colwell Bay and Brocken-

hurst beds is a point to be definitely settled. Most careful lists of fossils have been

prepared from collections made both from the Middle Ileadon at Colwell Bay and

WeHeadon Hill.  find that out of fifty-seven species at Colwell Bay, fifty-three

occiu- in the Middle Marine of Headon Hill, or 93 per cent. This clearly proves

the identity of the horizon in the two localities.

The well-known shells Cerithium concavum and C. ventricosxim occur both in

Colwell Bay and Ileadon Hill, and on the same horizons. C. concavum appears

to have a less restricted range at Headon Hill than C. venti-icosum, occxirtmg abun-

dantly there through the greater part of the Middle Ileadon series. It has also

been found in the ' Venus bed ' of Colwell Bay. Thus both stratigraphical and

palffiontological evidence are in harmony. All evidence tends cleavly and con-

clusively to show that there is only one marine series in this section, viz. the Middle

Headon of Edward Forbes, which is interstratitied between the freshwater Lower

and freshwater Upper Headon ; while there is no evidence of the Brockenhurst

bed occurring anywhere in the west of the island.

   --Whitecliff Bay ami the Neiv Forest. The Brockenhurst bed was recognised at

Whitecliff Bay, by the Rev. 0. Fisher, in 1864, where it occurs in the lowest two

feet of the Middle Headon series. No less than 70 species have been collected

here out of 104 known at Brockenhurst. Many species are peculiar to it, but all

are identical with those of the well-known section in the railway-cutting near

и Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, vol. xxxvi. p. 137.
        TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.            523

Brockenliurst. Many species are confined to this horizon and do not pass up into
the ' Venus bed.' Thus the Brockenhurst fauna at Whitechff Bay numbers 70

species, at Brockenhurst 104, and of these only eig-hteen occur in the Middle

Marine beds of Colwell Bay, or are common to Whitecliff Bay and the type locality.

Eighty-three Barton or Bracklesham species pass up, twenty-five to the Middle
Marine of Colwell Bay, and thirty-si.t to the Brockenhurst bed of Whitecliff" Bay,
or these two localities yield the above number of Bartonian forms. To still

further illustrate the value of the Middle Ileadon series of the Isle of Wight and
elsewhere, I may mention certain characteristic fossils that occur in several

zones. The ' Venus bed ' of the Geological Survey is about thirty feet thick at
Colwell Bay, Headon Hill, and Whitecliff" Bay, and contains the "following well-

marked shells, Murex se.vdentatus, Melanin fasciata, Cerithiuni duplex, C. ventri-

cosum, C. concavum, and Nerita apertn. Shells characteristic of the Brockenliurst

bed and confined to it are Voluta suturalis, Leiostoma ovatum, Tecten hellicostatus,
Modiola nysti, Cyprina nysti, and Cytherea solandri, var. attenuata. In the Roy-
don zone occurs Voluta geminata, and nowhere else in England. Pleurotoma

tramversai-ia, P. suldenticulata , Cardita deltoidea, and Protocardium hantontense are

in both the Roydon and Brockenhurst zones, but not known in the Venus bed.
Certain species range through the Middle Headon series and occur nowhere else.

These are Pisania labiata, Pleurotoma headonensis, Cancellaria muricata, C. elongata,
Leda propinqua, Cytherea suborbicularis, Psammobia (estuarina, and Corbicula obo-
vata. The Brockenhurst zone is restricted to the lower 2 feet of the Middle

Headon, and it lies immediately on the eroded surface of the Lower Headon. An
error certainly has been committed in the New Forest section, in assigning the

place of the Brockenhurst series above the Middle Marine or Middle Headon. This

IS at variance with facts at Brockenhurst and Whitecliff" Bay, and this misappre-

hension as to the stratigraphical position of the Brockenhurst bed refutes the theory
as to the occurrence of this bed high up in Headon Hill. It is not in existence

there.

With reference to the affinities of the Brockenhurst fauna, it has been stated

that ' nearly one-third of the Hordwell and Headon Hill marine shells are Barton

forms, and not more than one-fifth of those occumng at Brockenhurst, Colwell Bay,
Weand Whitecliff" Bay, are found at Barton.'
                                              should not expect the Venus bed

or Middle Marine would have more Barton species than the Brockenhurst bed, seeing

that the former occupies a higher zone in the Middle Headon series. The percentage

of Barton forms, according to Mr. Tawney, in the Whitley Ridge bed, is 42 per cent.

a lower proportion than at Whitecliff" Bay, arising from the number of corals being

special to the Whitley locality. At Whitecliff' Bay the Barton group has 52 per cent.,

and the proportion of Barton forms from all the Brockenhurst localities, including

the Roydon zone, is 48 per cent., and the percentage of the Barton forms in the Middle

Headon of Headon Hill is found to be 29 per cent. ; the conclusion therefore from

fossil evidence is that the Headon Hill marine lied is later in age, and higher

6tratigraphically than the Brockenhurst bed, the proportion of Barton forms in the

latter being nearly 50 per cent., and not one-fifth, as stated. The result is in strict

accordance with their stratigraphical positions. It is equally important to test by

fossil evidence whether the Colwell Bay Venus bed (Middle Headon) is more

nearly related to the Brockenhurst than is the Headon Hill bed. In Colwell Bay

the observed Barton forms are 29 per cent, in common, and the same percentage

in the Headon Hill bed, while in the Brockenhurst bed they were 48 per cent. To

test still more the proof from palaeontological evidence, it is stated, on the same
authorities, that there are only two species in each case common to either Colwell

Bay, or Headon Hill and Brockenhurst, and not occurring at Barton ; while there are

twenty-six species common to Colwell Bay and Headon Hill, and not occurring at

Brockenhurst. It is clear, therefore, from all fossil and physical or stratigi-aphical

evidence, that the position of the Brockenhurst bed has been misconceived ; and

it would be fatal to re-name the whole series of strata hitherto so well known

and well determined as the Middle Marine or Middle Headon, of the Isle of Wight,

and call it the * Brockenhurst series.' The classification and nomenclature of the

Geological Survey must therefore be restored and maintained, all recent examination
526-  --EEPOET 1882.

having strengtliened the previous labours of Forbes and Bristow, and the later re-

searclies of Messrs. Tawney and Keeping have still more firmly established the
succession and correlation of the Middle Headon series of the island, and aflbrding
a basis for further research and analysis for the ' Anglo-Parisian or Hampshire

Tertiary Basin.'

     Mr. Tawney prepared an important paper upon the Upper Bagshot Sands of
Hordwell Cliff, which was read before the Cambridge Philosophical Society and
published in their Proceedings. The object of the communication was to discuss

the affinities of the Bagshot series with a view to their classification, and also to

endeavour to show their correlation and equivalents in the Paris basin. 'All
observers are agreed as to the actual position of the sands lieing below the fresh-
water Lower Headon. Edward Forbes and the Geological Survey distinctly ally
it to the Marine Bagshot beds. They place it in the Middle Eocene Bagshot series,
terming it Upper Bagshot (instead of Headon Hill Sands). Forbes noticed the
fact of its containing Barton species at Whiteclift' Bay. This shows its afiiuity to
Barton beds. Dumont favoured a similar classification in his essaj', and in his
table the Headon Hill sands are grouped with the Barton clay as being respectively

equivalent to the upper and lower divisions of the Behjian Laekenian, while the

Headon Hill limestones and marls are placed in the Tonr/rien. Lately these views
have been questioned by the author of the ' Oligocene Strata of the Hampshire
Basin,' in the 'Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society,' vol. xxxvi., who
regards these beds as constituting the lowest member of the Headon group, stress
being laid upon the occurrence of Cerithiuni concaiiim as a test. The author also
places the whole of the Upper Bagshot sands and the Lower and Middle Headon
beds as the equivalents of tlie jNIortefontaiue sands, placing them above the St.
Ouen limestone ; these St. Ouen beds representing perhaps the Osborne, and all
three Headon divisions, which come above the Mortefontaine beds. Ceritldum con-
cavum is said to occur both in the Bagshot and Headon series. Careful research

and examination shows that the shell in question is Lamarck's C. pleurotomoides
in the one case, and not C. concavum, which species has evidently been con-
founded with the Lamarckean shell. Examination of equivalent beds in France
by Mr. Tawney, and the researches of Professor Hebert and M. Munier-Ohalnias
clearly show that the Mortefontaine sands do not contain Cerithium concavuyn,

the sliell so common on that horizon being C. plei(roto7noides Lamk. Gompariaon
of the Headon shell with those brought from near Mortefontaine shows that
the Long Mead End species agrees with the French form. It would appear that
there is much greater parallelism between the French and English series than we
have hitherto expected. The Mortefontaine sands are the upper part of the Sables

de Beauchamp, representing our Barton beds; above this comes the Oalcaire de
St. Ouen, chiefly of fi-eshwater origin. Connected with the St. Ouen limestone are
sands and marls, containing at the top and bottom Cerithium concavum abundantly.

     The St. Ouen period, therefore, witliout doubt represents our Headon series.
'In our Hampshire basin the freshwater and marine condition in the Headon
series are not in the same order as in the St. Ouen beds.' ' The marine facies in
Hampshire, with C. concavum, comes between the freshwater Lower and Upper
Headon deposits, near Montjavoult ; tlie bulk of the freshwater limestones is in
 the centre or between two deposits with this CeritJnum conr(ivu?)i.' ' In the Paris
 basin, therefore, the zone of C. concavum is not connected with the zone of
 C. pleurotomoides, but comes immediately above it.' Thus C. concavum charac-
terises the Middle Headon of Colwell Bay and Hordwell, while C. pleurotomoides
is found only in the Upper Bagshot of Long ilead End. That the Long Mead

End sands and those of Mortefontaine are equivalents few can doubt. Both

succeed or constitute the uppermost portion of the Barton beds, and 2-5 per cent,
of the fossils are in common. These affinities show that the term Upper Bagshot
sands is the most appropriate, and expresses the relationship of these sands, since

 the Barton and Bracklesham beds together are usually considered as the equivalents
 of the Middle Bagshots. The author believes, therefore, that it would be wi'ong to

reject Edward Forbes's name of 'Upper Bagshot' for the Long Mead End sands,
 and accept in place of it the older term of Headon Hill sands.

Mr. A. II. S. Lucas, M.A., in his concise tut valuable paper ' On the Headon

Beds of the Western Extremity of the Isle of Wight,' correctly states, upon refer-

ring to the recent ' answer to the present questioning of the hitherto accepted cor-

relations of the beds of the Lower fluvio-marine Tertiaries of the Isle of Wight and

South Hants, that it is obviously impossible for foreign geologists to institute

useful comparisons between British and foreign subdivisions so long as we in

England are quite at variance on the stratigraphical and palseontological facts of

the beds in question.

' The general relation of the whole group can only be satisfactorily determined

after the primary question of the continuity or discontinuity of theColwell Bay
and Headon Hill beds is settled. At present there are two very definite, yet difterent

views, having a perfectly distinct issue ; first, that the brackish-marine beds of Col-

well Bay correspond with the brackish-marine beds of Headon Hill which have

been seen ; or, secondly, that they correspond to some higher marine beds which

have not been seen.' Both these views and arguments are now fairly before those

competent to judge. In 1880, however, Professor Judd, in his paper 'On the
Oligocene Strata of the Hampshire Basin,' ^ questioned and denied the succession as
determined by Forbes and the Survey; this paper dealt with strata or higher marine

beds stated above by Mr. Lucas as ' not having been seen.' Ou the other hand, in
1881, Messrs. Tawney and Keeping brought to bear upon the question a mass of
evidence in support of the work of Edward Forbes and the Survey* showing con-

clusively the identity and continuity of the Colwell Bay and Headon Hill Suvio-

marine beds. Still more recently, however, Professor Blake ^ has 'advanced an

entirely new correlation, adducing stratigraphical e^sidence in its favour.' His

observations do not agree in certain cases either with those of Professor Judd or
Messrs. Tawney and Keeping. It is hoped, however, by or through evidence at the

present meeting, that the question of the succession will be finally determined.

Mr. Lucas does not attempt any solution as to the relation of these beds at Colwell
Bay and Headon Hill to the deposits exposed at Hordwell, Brockenhurst, or
WhiteclifF Bay ; they do not concern the succession. But the standard or syn-

thetic sections at different localities, like those prepared by Messrs. Tawnev and

Keeping, have tended to clear iip the succession, fully testing the continuity of
the beds under dispute under their several aspects along the plane of deposition.

This independent mode fully bears out the exact work of the Survey, showino-

differences in degree as regards accumulation, yet continuity as regards succession.

Mr. Lucas gives measured sections of the freshwater beds, and the brackish marine

series (p. U'J loc. cit.), which confirm the work of the above authors.

The Headon beds were long ago ' measured by Dr. Wright, lately by the authors

just quoted, and the Osborne series by Edward Forbes, and the main divisions

Aare so conspicuous that there can be no doubt about the succession.'                    third

paper upon the Fluvio-marine Beds of the Isle of Wight was read before the

Geologists' Association, in June 1881, under the title, ' On a Continuous Section of

Oligocene Strata from Colwell Bay to Headon Hill,' <= by Prof. J. F, Blake, M.A..

r.G.S. The author contends for a difference between the faunfe of the Colwell Bav
beds and those of Hesdon Hill, and states that the ' fauna of the so-called Oligocene

group is chiefiy to be found in the '_' Venus bed " of Colwell Bay ; but the assumed

other " Venus bed " at Headon Hill contains rather the fauna of the uppermost

Eocene, or zone of CeritMum concavum.' The question,'however, turns upon the

identity of the two so-called Venus beds. In other words, the Colwell Bav ' Venus

bed                      is  said  by the  author  to  have  one fauna,  and the Headon  Hill ' Venus bed '

another. This determination I hold to he untenable, all fossil and physical evidence

being to the contrary, and show that they are one and the same bed. On both sides

of Bramble Chine the ' Venus bed ' is fully developed. Mr. Blake calls it the
' Oyster bed.' Below these come thin bands of stratified marl, with abundance of
Cerithea and Cyrena (not Cyclas, as stated). The Widdick Chine sands can be no
other than the Ileadon Hill sands, and not the Upper Bagshots. The altitude of

these sands above the sea Mr. Blake estimated at 100 feet ; this is certainlv

too great an elevation, 70 feet being the received measurement by independent

observers. Such difference, if it existed, would alter the reading and sequence of

succeeding and higher beds in the section. The author seems to have omitted

the Trigonorcelin and NeritinaheA. immediately above the How Ledge limestone and

below the thick oyster band. These correspond with the Warden Cliff section, and

determine continuity of deposition, or are a confirmation of the identity of the beds.

This is a crucial point in the continuity and equivalency of the marine series in
Totland and Colwell Bays. The Trigonocoelia bed here is on the same horizon

as in Warden Cliff and Colwell Bay, associated with Cerithium pseudoctncttmi,

Melanopsis fusiformis, Natica labeUafa, &c. The lower or Neritina concava

bed, with Melanopsis fusiformis and Coj-hicula ovata, occurs also in tlie same

position near the base of the series at Warden Cliff and Colwell Bay. ' This can

only be explained by admitting that the Marine series in Totland Bay and Colwell
Bay are identical.' The occurrence of ' Cerithium ventricosum at the top, and tbe

--nei-itina \_N. concava] and Trigonoccelia \_2\ deltoidea] at the base identical in

physical and fossil characters, are strong presumptive proof of this.' It is extremely

doubtful if Cerithium mnrynritaceiim, mentioned on page 6 of Mr. Blake's paper,

occurs in the Colwell Bay section, or in the western area of the Isle of Wight

the Cerithium cinctum is really C. pseudocinctum, and Cijclas obovata should be

Cyrena obovata. The genus Cyclas does not occur. In correlation these are impor-

tant items, especially with a continental fauna. It will also be found that the

--oyster beds do not rest immediately on the How Ledge limestone as asserted the

Triyonocalia and Neritina beds intervene, and, as at Colwell Bay, determine or

prove the succession and identity of the sei-ies. At pp. 156-7 Mr. Blake remarks

upon the similarity of the succession of the Colwell Bay beds with those of Headon

Hill, and h ' tempted to come to the conclusion' that the two ' Venus beds are

identical ;' [they have always been so believed and recognised] : he at the same

time states that ' it would be absurd to argue that they are identical because they

contain similar common fossils,' when it has been ' determined by Professor Judd
Wethat the faunas are remarkably distinct.'
                                             have no other method whereby to

determine the age and synchronism of deposits except through organic remains, and

the faunre of the ' Venus beds ' at both localities are to me identical, and Professor

Blake depends upon fossil evidence all through his paper, yet evidently he

has not carefully examined the more complete fauna of the ' Venus bed ' at

both localities. In another paragraph, on page 157, the author states the

proposition ' that the Colwell Bay " Venus bed " is not certainly identical

with that at Headon Hill, but may occupy a higher horizon.' Mr. Blake sug-

gests that the Headon Hill bed corresponds with the series intervenin? between

the Colwell Bay bed   and  the  How Ledge  limestone                                        and  that  the  Colwell Bay
                                                                                         ;

bed corresponds with the slightly fossiliferous sands immediately below the Headon

Hill limestone. This position or suggestion certainly cannot be received. In

this case the so-called two ' Venus beds ' would be superposed on each other, and

nothing to separate them. The sands referred to are those at the base of the

Upper Headon series, and are freshwater, for they contain Thiio. Again, Pro-

fessor Blake's suggestion would thus place the Colwell Bay ' Venus bed ' below

the Great Limestone, whereas Professor Judd in his paper would place it above.

The author does not find any equivalents of the Colwell Bay oyster beds above

the Heidon Hill limestone at Headon Hill ; indeed that would be impossible, for

they are indisputably the Osborne marls of Professor Forbes, and capped by the

Bembridge limestone.

As regards the terms Eocene and Oligocene, and their relation to each other,

and the correlation of British strata and fossils with those of Germany, &c., it is
                                                                                                    TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                                                                                             529

far too intricate a question to be passed over, although without doubt the fluvio-
luarine strata of the Hampshire basin will ere long receive critical supervision with
reference to similar deposits on the Continent. So far back as December 18G3,

Ilevr Adolf Von Kunen read his paper on the correlation of the Oligocene de-

posits of Belo'ium, North German}-, and the South of England, and endeavoured

to show that in Britain we had an assemblage of fossils in our so-called Middle

Eocene at Brockenhurst, Lyndhurst, and Roydon in the New Forest, that could be

stratigraphically correlated with beds of the same age termed Oligocene in Northern

German}^ The author believed that these Brockenhurst beds were of the same
age as the Middle TIeadon beds of Colwell Bay and Wliiteeliff Ba}'. This view
has led to much controversy, arising from the fact that no Brockenhurst species
occur in Colwell Bay. The rich cabinet of Mr. F. Edwards theu atibrded Von
KiJiien every facility for the comparison and determination of the species occurring
common to Britain and Germany. Beyrich established the name Oligocene for the
fossils of this age in Germanj'. The Lower Oligocene is well-developed, with a true
marine fauna, in Belgium near Tongres (N. of Liege) and in the N. of Germany
between Magdeburg, Bernberg, Egelu, and Helmstiidt (near Brunswick). This
Lower Oligocene contains 700 species of moUusca besides other groups. The most
characteristic of these the author asserts are found at Brockenhurst, and in Mr.
Edwards's cabinet fifty-si.x species occur, twenty-one of which are Barton clay forms,
and forty-three of the fifty-six species occur in the Lower Oligocene of Germany.

In this paper the author draws attention to a few points which have either

escaped notice or on which he would put a different construction. 1. The remark-
able boulders of crystalline and other old rocks of Pagham were noticed long

ago by Mr. Dixon and Mr. Godwin-Austen ; and Mi-. Codrington has more recently
described similar boulders in the gravel of Portsea Tsland. Those of Hayling

Island have not yet been noticed ; nevertheless they are very numerous. The

author describes two of (p-anite and three of srindsfone of large size on the shore near

the railway station, and" states that he counted thirty smaller ones in a mile to the

westward of the station. The greater number, however, of those on the shore facing
South Hayling village seem to have been collected to form rockwork in the Grotto
grounds and in the grounds of "\^'estfield House. Amongst them are boulders of
i/ranite, syenite, porphijrii, slate, ?a\i\ sandstone. They are found scattered in lesser
numbers all over the island, embedded in the flint gravel and loam which overlies

the London clay. ]Mr. Godwin-Austen considered that the Sussex boulders might
be derived from an old coast now submerged in the area of the Britisli Channel,

but the author sees reason to believe that they are more probably derived from

Athe coast of Devon and Cornwall.                                                                   large fragment of silicified Portland wood has

been described by the Rev. 0. Fisher from Pagham, and the author saw in Hayling

Island a piece above two feet in length of well-characterised Portland wood.
The granites and other rocks, tliough not yet determined, seem to resemble West of

England rocks, and he saw none of the characteristic granite of Cherbourg

amongst the Ijoulders. Further, the author found at Stubbington Cliff and Hill

Head numerous quart zite pebbles similar to those of the Budleigh conglomerate.

He concludes therefore that the boulders were carried here by ice at the time

of the old Raised Beach of Brighton, Portland, and the Devon coast, and that their
absence in the intermediate area is due to the destruction of the beach and the

wear back of the old coast line, except at a few spots where, with remnants of

the beach, the boulders have been preserved.

quartz pebbles, but the occurrence of Greensand chert and ragnfone does not

appear to liave been yet noticed by any writer on the subject. As this constitutes

a very essential point in the consideration of the origin of the drift and other ques-
tions, the author wishes to draw attention to its constant presence in all the flint
gravels from tlie coast to the extreme northern boundary of the tertiary basin,
not only in the low-levels and valleys, but also in the higher level gravels of the
highest hills, of chert and ragstone which so fai' from being rare are often present
in the remarkably large proportion of 5 to 10 per cent.

     3. The drift at Freshwater Gate has been divided into lower and upper flint
gravel and overlying brick eartli ; the upper gravel with elephant remains, and the
brick earth with pupa and snccinea. Tlie author considers, however, that the drift
constitutes only one mass irregularly bedded and irregularly intercalating ; that
it is in fact a series of lenticular and thinning-out masses rather than regular beds.
In this respect as well as in its organic remains it resembles the drift and rubble
bed overlying the Eaised Beaches of Brighton, Sandgate, Portland, and tlie coast
l3eyond,with which, therefore, the author correlates it. The author further shows
that, as suggested by Mr. Codrington on other grounds, the land at the back of
the Isle of Wight has been much encroaclied on by the sea, and he argues from the
presence of chert from the Greensands, and of ironstone fragments apparently
from the Wealden, that the valley at Freshwater Gate extended some distance
further south and ended in hills, now removed, of Wealden and Greensand strata.

           2. 'Noies on the Bure Valley Beds and the Westleton Beds.

                          By Horace B. Woodward, F.G.8.

After referring to two papers read before the British Association at York in

1881 b}^ Prof Prestwich, the author stated bis reasons for concluding that the

pebble-gravels of the Bure Valley witli Tellinn Balthica (the Bure Valley Beds

proper) were distinct from the shingle at Westleton (the Westleton Beds proper).

In company with 3Ir. .T. H. Blake, lie had (in 1876) traced the latter beds from

Westleton to Dunwicli f Uifi", where they occurred in the upper part of the so-called

' Middle Glacial ' beds of Messrs. Wood and Ilarmer. These Westleton Beds, con-

sisting largely of flint-shingle, have been traced from Westleton and Southwold to

Ilalesworth and Haddiscoe. In the neighbourhood of Haddiscoe and Loddon, the

author had found evidence to show that this shingle occurred above the Lower

Glacial brick-earth (Contorted Drift), and hence that the Westleton Beds could

not be of the age of the Bure Valley Beds, which occurred beneath this brick-earth,

and (in his opinion) formed tlie upper poi'tion of the Norwich Crag Series. For the

same reason, the Mundesley Beds, whicli occurred beneath the Lower Glacial Drift

on the Norfollv coast, could not be of the age of the Westleton Beds. Nor were

the Mundesley and Bure Valle}' Beds of the same age. The former include the Leda

myalis Bed of Mr. (J. lieid, which occurs at the top of the Forest Bed Series ; the
latter are equivalent to the "\^'^eybourn Crag which occurs at the base of the Forest

Bed Series. Hence the Bure Valley Beds were part of the Norwich Crag Series,

and of Pliocene age ; the Mundesley Beds belonged to the debateable group of ' Pre-

Glacial '  Beds                        while  the  Westleton Beds were of Glacial age.

                3. On the Sources of the Salt Siq^ply of India.

                 By Professor V. Ball, M.A., F.E.S., F.G.8.

     Although the general economic importance of the salt trade of India is widely
recognised, the nett annual revenue derived from the salt tax amounting to
7,000,000/., still the actual nature of the varied sources which contribute to the
supply are perhaps not so well understood as might be expected.

    These sources may most conveniently be ranged under the following head-
ings :--

   --I. Imports. Chiefly from the United Kingdom, but also from Arabia. Total

per annum 300,000 tons.
TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  531

  --TT. Sea-salt. Is prepared in pans on the sea-coast, either by solar or artificial

evaporation.

  --III. Lixiciation <if Saline earths. The presence of various salts in the soil is

attributable to a hifjh deg;ree of evaporation unaccompanied by subsoil drainage.
Sterility over wide areas, where this is the case, lias often i-esulted from irrio^ation.

  --IV. Saline Sj>riiu/>i and Wells. Very abundant in parts of Assam, Burma, and

the Punjab, where, as is often the case in other countries, they occur in conjunc-
tion with petroleum sprinprs.

      V. Lakes with larj^e drainage areas and no outlets. Principal of these situated
in Raiputana. The present annual out-turn of the Sambhar Lake exceedg

100,000 tons.

   --VI. Rock-salt. There are two deposits, both situated in the Punjab: though

geographically speaking they occur near to one another, geologically thej^ are
widely separated, being of .Silurian and I'locene ages respectively.

     The author having given some details under each of tlie above headings, and
mentioned the modes of occurrence of some other salts besides the sodium chloride,
stated that more complete information on these subjects would be found in his
' Economic Geology of India.'

    The carboniferous limestone of this area is capable of division into a series of

beds of limestones, separated by thick deposits of shale and sandstone, traversed by an

intrusive sheet of basalt known as the Whin Sill. The section above that horizon

consists only of 200 feet of limestones, while sandstones reach 3.50 feet, and shales

520 feet, lleneath the Whin Sill there are 000 feet of measures in which occur

manj' important beds of limestone, one of which, the ' Melmerby Scar Limestone,'
reaches a thickness of 124 feet. The chief lead measures occur in the Clreat

--Limestone (70 feet), the Scar Limestone (30 feet), and in the Tyne Bottom

Limestone the latter deriving its name from the South Tyne over which it
flows for a considerable distance. Below this horizon but little has been done to
explore the lead lodes, owing to the water-charged character of the strata

beneath the river bed.

    The veins are nearly in every case foults of small throw. Where the two
'cheeks' consist of limestone, the fissure forming the vein contains lead, when it
intersects beds of sandstone it is filled with copper, and in both cases, when these
are absent, the veins are tilled with brown iron-ore, containing 30 to 4-5 per cent.

of metallic iron. Should the proposed railway between Middleton in Teesdale
and Alston be carried out, it will bring these valuable iron-ores into easy access of
the Middlesboro' iron furnaces.

6. Oil the Geolorjy of Cardigan Toivii. By Walter Keeping, M.A., F.G.S.^

  --The pale felspathic grits and black slates of Newport Bay and Cardigan are of

-Middle Bala or (iJaradoc age not Ijlandovery as hitherto supposed.

     Above these come (2) rolling beds of pale-coloured, coarse, fiaggv slates, and
pale blue splintery slates, doubtless also of Bala age. Some ratherdarker shalv
slates (3) with rabby shales and ' cone in cone ' concretions next succeed, and
then we meet with (4) a small compact set of pale felspathic grits of the same

character as those at Cardigan. These also I regard as probably of Bala age

(Upper Bala slate series). The overlying rather dark shaly slates (5), with some

--rab, presenting the gradual incoming of the Aberystwyth grits, are passage beds of

Caradoc Llandovery age.
     The grits of Llangrannog are the same as those of Aberystwj'th ( Aberi'stwyth

grits), and the overlying slates with worm-like markings are our ' Metalliferous
slate series ' which belong to the same great rock group.

     There is no evidence of any stratigi'aphical break in the rock groups of South
Cardiganshire from the Llandeilo to the Llandovery period inclusive, but the whole
series appears perfectly continuous.

     The Aberystwyth grits are less developed here than further north, this being-
near tlie line of their southerly disappearance by dying out.

     Here then, as in North Wales (I)ovey Valley), we find a considerable series of
Upper Bala slates passing up into the Llandovery group. It has been proved

elsewhere that the Cardiganshire rock group lies conformably under the Tarannon

shale.s, and here we find its inferior limits equallj' ill-defined, gradually passing
down into a great series of imperfect slate-rocks which belong to the Upper Bala

group.

    Thus we find no great physical break, but perfect continuity amongst the

Silurian and Cambrian rocks of South Wales.

The following Papers and Reports were read :

  1. On the Post-Miocene Deposits of the Boveu Basin, South Devon,
                      By W. PengellV, FB.S., F.G.S.

The deposits of the Bovey Basin stretch in a south-easterlj' direction for about

nine miles from tlie neighbourhood of the little town of Bovey Tracey to that of

Kingskerswell. The river Teign ilows through the area for about five miles, and

its tributary, the Bovey, for about three miles. Investigations carried on in 1S60-1

showed that, near the north-western end of the basin, the deposits consisted of

three distinct groups, the lowermost being a group of lignites, clays, and sands ; on

which lay uncouformably an accumulation termed ' Head,' consisting of clay and

sand, with very numerous angular and  subangular stones                                                                      on wliich again  lay the

uppermost group of clays and sands, with renuiins of tlie dwarf birch (Betula

nana). The lignite group is admitted on all liauds to be of Lower Miocene or

Upper Eocene age ; the Betula nana clays belong with equal certainty to early post-
glacial times, when a flora now confined to Arctic and Alpine habitats flourished

in South Devon ; whilst the intermediate Head, necessarily of intermediate age, is

believed by most observers to be of glacial age and origin.

Since 1861 a human figure carved in wood, potsherds, and a bronze spearhead,

have been met with in various parts of the Head, all near tlie Teign, and below its

ordinary level; whilst in 1881 a canoe, formed by hollowing out a large tree, and

nine feet long, was found thirty feet below the surface ; that is to say, it lay twenty
feet deep in clay, over which was the Head, liaving a depth of ten feet. Its site was

twenty feet above the level of the highest known Hood-waters of the Bovey, the

nearest river, and eighty feet above spring-tide highwater.

In speculating on the chronology of the ' finds,' tlie writer stated that there

was historical proof that there had been no change of level within the area since

the Norman Conquest, and if the Fussc-jca;/ be a Roman work, none since the

Roman occupation He was of opinion that the hypothesis of the rivers having, in

times of flood, dislodged and redeposited portions of the Head, and incorporated

comparatively modern objects, was sufficient to account for the presence of the

wooden figure, the potsherds, and the spearhead ; but that the canoe, from its great

depth in the clay, i]i which stones had never been found, belonged to a difl'erent

category ; that, in sliort, he saw no reason to doubt that the era of the canoe was

prior to that of Betida nana in  Devonshire                                               prior, also, to the accumulation of the

Glacial times.

2. On the Origin of the Hannatite Deposits in the Carboniferous Limestone.
                       By Edwakd Wethered, F.Q.S., F.G.S.

    The author contended that the so-called 'pockets' of haematite which occur in
the Carboniferous Limestone were caverns and fissures into which the ore had been
introduced by water agency. There were two or three signs which indicated an

approach to a pocket of ore.
     1 Joints appeared in the rock through which water percolated.

    2. An ordinary cavern opened out, termed by the AVelsh miners a ' locus,' the

sides of which were coated with large crystals of carbonate of lime.
      3. Traces of iron are found in the * locus.'

    The fact that the first indications of ore were cracks in the rock, down which

water percolated, certainly pointed to tlie inference that by a similar percolation, the
haematite has been brought into its present position. That it has been de-
posited by aqueous agency was clear from the crystalline character of some of the
ore. Further, there was just what would be expected from water containing the
carbonates of lime and iron in solution wliere not exposed to the atmosphere, namely,
lime has been first deposited and subsequently h}'drated peroxide of iron.

     The next point considered was, from whence was the iron derived. The highly
ferruginous character of the Carboniferous strata was well understood, and the fire-
clays indicated that large quantities of iron had been rendered soluble by the de-
oxidizing influence of decaying vegetable matter, and removed by the percolation
of water. But, as to whether it was this iron which had given rise to the Carboni-
ferous Limestone hiematite deposits was a matter for consideration. It was doubt-
ful whether there would have been sutticient time for the fissures and caverns to
have so far developed as to form receptacles for the coal-measure water charged
with carbonate of iron. It must, however, be remembered that after the uplifting
of the Palaeozoic rocks there was a vast lapse of time during the denudation by
the Triassic Sea, and that much of the limestone, not now overlain by the Goal
Measures and jMillstone-grit, was covered by those beds for a considerable time.
Further, water percolating through the Coal Measures would become highly charged
with carbonic acid, given ort" from vegetation undergoing transition into coal, and
water, so charged, would not be so long in dissolving and eroding out caverns.

     Mr. Etberidge had referred ^ the origin of the Carboniferous haematites, in the

West of England, to the infilling of faults, fissures, etc., during the denudation by the

Triassic Sea ; but stated that " doubtless the percolation of water through overlying

strata, highly charged with oxides of iron, had been a source and mode of accumu-
lation." Though the author was disposed to consider it possible that some of
the hrematite may have been derived from the percolation of water through
the C'oal Pleasures and Millstone-grit, yet he agi-eed with Mr. Etberidge
that the most probable source was from the Trias rocks; not, however, during
the accumulation of the strata composing that formation, but by subsequent

percolation of water after consolidation of the beds. This water, on arriving at the

Carboniferous Limestone, would flow down the cracks, fissures, and joints, provided
there were such, but a comparatively small portion would filter through the actual
rock on account of its being but slightly pervious to water. The author considered
that it was owing to this fact that we generally find haematite where the Magnesian
Conglomerate rests upon the ( 'arboniferous Limestone. The water being unable to
penetrate the rock, would naturally find an outlet at the junction of the two forma-
tions, and the conditions would soon be arrived at when the deposition of the iron
would take place.

(Pharetrones, Zit.), there are several species belougiug to the Peronella and other

genera.

    Many of these species are scarcely separable from those occurring in the White

Jura of the Continent. The characters of the deposits in which they are found
indicate shallow water conditions, thus showing that the Hexactinellid sponges
were at this time less characteristically deep-water dwellers than at the present day.
The originally siliceous skeletons of Hexactinellids, Lithistids, and Catagmids have
all alike undergone a complete replacement by carbonate of lime ; the silica removed
has been redeposited in quartzose granules and crystals, frequently replacing the
calcic carbonate of associated corals and other fossils.

7. Evidence of Wave-Action at a depth of 40 fathoms in the English

                  Channel. By Arthur B. Hunt, M.A., F.G.S.

     The author described and exhibited a soda-water bottle trawled about 20 miles
S.S.E. of the Start in a depth of about 40 fathoms. It is partially encrusted with
marine organisms. The surface, where exposed, presents the appearance of being
finely scratched or ground, and the embossed letters of the legend are chipped and
abraded. Many of the encrusting serpute are in a fragmentary state. The bottle
when received was about half full of a deposit consisting of quartzose sand, small
stones, shells (both whole and fragmentary), and other organic debris. Thirty-eight
species of sliells have been recognised ; two of them, a fusus and a single valve of

pecten, were so large that they could only pass through the neck of the bottle in

one position, the interior of it being slightly oval.

     The abraded exterior surface of the bottle, the broken serpulfe, and the presence

of stones and such large shells in the interior, indicated a considerable disturbance

at the bottom of the sea at some time after the bottle had been deposited there.

The fact that sei-pulffi were present at all proved that the disturbance was inter-

mittent and not continuous. The intermittent character of the disturbance

precluded its being referred to tidal currents, which would be constant in their

action, and pointed to reciprocal currents set up by waves during violent storms.

The fact that the exterior surface of the bottle in places presents the appearance of

ground glass cannot be ascribed to any chemical action of the sea-water, as there

is  no  corrosion  of  the  interior  surface                               nor  can  the  chippings  of  tlie  embossed
                                                                         ;

letters or the abrasion of the exterior surface have been in existence before the

bottle fell into tlie sea, as they are unlike the wear and. tear exhibited by any old

soda-water bottle in common use. The fusiform shape of the bottle, presenting as

it does no plane surface on which to rest, would render it liable to be rolled by any

currents at the sea-bottom.

     For further evidence of the Action of waves on the bottom of the English
Channel, the author referred to his paper on the Formation of lUpplemark. (Proc.

Roy. Soc, 1882).

1. Meniion of an example of an Earlij Stage of Metamorj)hic Change in Old

    Bed Sandstone Cunglomerate, near Aherfoil. By Professor James Thom-

     son, LL.D., F.B.S.

The present commuuication relates to metamorphic clianges noticed in Old Eed

Sandstone Conglomerate near Aberfoil, in cuttings on the new branch railway from

Buclilyvie terminating at Aberfoil.

The author had an opportunity of seeing this on the occasion of a recent visit

to the railway, through the invitation of ]\]r. Charles Forman, of Messrs. Formans

and McCall, engineers of the line. 31r. Forman pointed out various geological

features which were e.xposed to view in the cuttings for the railway. Among

these were waterworn conglomerate pebbles, which had undergone distortion and

partial crushing, obviously indicating that they must have been from some cause

reduced to a semi-plastic condition.

The phenomena of these altered pebbles seemed to be of much interest in

connection with considerations or speculations as to what might be the softening-

agency to which they^ had been suljjected. Specimens were brought away ; and
some of them are now shown to the meeting.

    By inspection of tliese specimens it may be observed that they have yielded in

a plastic manner to the pressure of their contiguous neighbours, that they have

been impressed one into another at the spots of mutual contact, and that they have

bulged out and cracked open at interveningplaces between these spots of compression.

    The pebbles appear, many or most of them, to be quartzite.
    At various places in the cuttings of the railway within the first mile of its

course from Aberfoil, the Old Eed Sandstone Conglomerate of the district was found

to be altered in tliis way : but throughout the most of that space no such great

alteration was to be found, as the pebbles generally appeared not to have been

reduced to a plastic and yielding condition.

Questions must now occur for consideration and research, which however

the author does not propose at present to answer, as to whether the softening

influence was merely a high temperatui-e producing a partial fusion of the stone

and, if so, how the heat came to be localized or applied at particular places more

than  others                                also, whether hot water under great pressure, or hot gases, or vapours
                                         ;

of volcanic origin, were concerned in producing the eifects.

The author presumes that such phenomena as those he has described must have

been already noticed in various localities ; but he thinks the subject may yet be
worthy of further research and consideration. From Mr. John Young, F.G.S.,

Under-Keeper of the Ilunterian Museum in the University of Glasgow, he has

learned that Dr. Page, in a lecture delivered by him before the Geological Society
of Glasgow about 16 years ago, exhibited examples of similar quartzite pebbles
from the jSTethan Water, near Lesmahago, which were similarly cracked and dis-
torted by the pressure of contiguous pebbles.

2. On Features in Glacial MarJcivgs noticed on Sandstone Conglomernfes at
      Skehnorlie and Aherfoil. By Professor James Thomson, LL.D.,
      F.RS.

    When glacial striation is met with on rock faces, it may often be a matter of

interest to find in which way along the direction of parallelism of the striie the

abrading or polishing ice must have advanced. Casual observers, unskilled in the

scrutiny of glacial phenomena, may sometimes too hastily assume, when they find

the lines of the striae inclined to the horizon, that the ice has been moving over the
striated rock-face or hill-side in the downhill direction of the striae. The direction
of the motion of the ice along the strite, however, cannot generally be safely inferred
from mere local configurations of the land ; and, in some cases, the configuration of

the laud, whether locally regarded or considered in wide scope, may afford no de-
cisive proof at all as to which way the ice has advanced along the stria).
538 KEPORT-- 1882.

In the rather limited researches which the author has had opportunity to make

in respect to glacial phenomena in geology, he has felt interest in seeking for indi-

cations presented by the striated rock-faces themselves, which might conclusively

show in which way the ice must have advanced. He wishes, in the present paper,

to make mention of one or two rather remarkable indications of this kind which he

has met with in the last two years.

At Skelmorlie, on the Frith of Clyde, at a height of about 150 or 200 feet

above the sea, he has found glacially striated surfaces, on red sandstone containing

pebbles of quartz and of other kinds of stone. Many of these pebbles projected

considerably out from the general smoothed and striated surface of the sandstone,

and from each of such peblsles there extended to one side a ridge of the sandstone,

like a tail, the sandstone being there worn away less than at other places devoid of

the protecting influence of any hard protuberant pebble. The manner in which tlie

--protection had Ijeen given must have been this : The ice, in passing over the

protuberant hard pebble, must, in virtue of its plasticity, have had a groove

moulded into it by the pebble, and this groove passing forward from the pebble in

the motion of the ice, must have worn away the sandstone facing to it less than

would the other parts of the ice-face wear away the sandstone facing to them.

The length of the noticeable tail would depend mainly on the distance that the ice

Acould advance before the groove in it would be gradually obliterated.     pebljle of

the size of a bean, for instance, might often be found to have a tail visible for a

length of five or six inches, or perhaps from that to a foot, and larger pebbles might

be seen to have tails two or three feet in length.

Again, on the recent visit to the railway cuttings near Aberfoil, referred to by

the author in his previous communication, a remarkable example was found of a

glacially worn and finely striated conglomerate rock face. The situation of this is

at Ballanton, about a quarter of a mile from Aberfoil. The hard pebbles were of

various sizes, and many might be of sizes such as those of beans, and eggs, and

large potatoes. Some of them were worn away by the ice continuously with the

surrounding sandstone matrix ; but those of them which projected showed very

conspicuous tails, many of which might be four or five feet long or more.

Various other indications, presented by the striated surfaces themselves, of the

direction along the striffi in wliich the motion of the ice has been made, may occa-

sionally be found. Doubtless none can b(3 more strikingly remarkable than the

tails extending from hard pebbles or other hard nodules, or hard veins, included in

the ice-worn rock. The author wishes, however, to mention that on making minute

examination, by a magnifying lens, of the scratches on worn quartz pebbles in the

striated sandstone at Skelmorlie, he was able to find also in these verj' small mark-

ings, indications wliicli appeared clearly to show the direction of the motion of the

ice, and that these indications were perfectly in agreement with Ihose given by the

tails extending from the pebbles along the striated sandstone surface.

3. On the Equivalents in England of the ' Sahles de Bracheux,' and on the
      southern limits of the Thanet Sands. By Professor Prestwich, F.B.S.,

        F.G.S.

     The author dwells on the importance of establishing, in adjacent but separate
basins, a certain number of well-defined horizons. The lignite and fresh-water
beds of the Paris Lower Tertiaries and of the Woolwich series form one such zone,
but he considers the generally accepted correlation of the beds beneath not satis-
factory. The Bracheux sands are still, by all other geologists, placed on the
level of the Thanet sands and of the Lower Landenian beds. Some years ago '
the author saw reason to suppose they might rather be correlated with the lower
beds of the Woolwich series, and in this opinion he is confirmed by the more

recent researches of M. Deshayes, by whom many new species were described, and
many rectifications made of the species in M. Graves's lists from the Bracheux beds.

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  539

fTe shows that the lower Woolwich beds become glauconiferous as they raiifrp east-
ward thiough Kent ; that the fresh-water element disappears and a marine fauna is
substituted. This faima contains such Bracheux shells as the (hjthereu Belhuachia,
Nucula fragilis, and several others ; while the Glauconte Infirieure or Bracheux
sands contain such characteristic Woolwich shells as the Ostrea Bellovacina,
Pectuncultis terebratularis, &c. Several of the shells are, it is true, Thanet Sand
shells, but they also range iqi into the Woolwich series, whilst many characteristic

Thanet Sand fossils, such as the Phohxlomya Konickii and others, are wantintr.
     The author concludes that the Thanet sands are absent in the Paris basin,

as they are in the Hampshire basin ; that the sea of that period was limited to the
south-east of England, Belgium, and French Flanders, and that it was not until
the commencement of the Woolwich and Reading period that the Paris area was
submerged and beds of this age spread over it. The molluscan iauna of the latter
period has as much analogy Avith the London Clay series as with the Thanet sands.
If this correlation be correct, then it would relegate that remarkable deposit of the

Rilly sands, with its group of curious species of F/ii/sa, Helir, Ci/clostonui, &c., to

the middle of the Woolwich and Reading series, instead of to the base of all the
tertiary series, where it is now placed. As the question involves the range of several
tertiary genera and many other questions hinge upon it, the exact determination
of this point is of much interest, and the author, while advancing his own opinion
on the subject, invites further attention to it, as the English fossils are few in
number, and there are many points connected with it still somewhat obscure.

4. Suggestions for a Revised Classification of British Eocenes. By J. S.

                                              Gardner, F.G.8.

     Some modification in the classification of the Eocenes has become desirable,
through the transfer of the Upper Eocene group of Edward Forbes to the Oligo-
cene Ibrmation. The discoverj'^ of several distinct floras seems also to necessitate

certain alterations, in order to bring periods, founded originally on changes in
moUusca, into harmony with the more striking changes indicated by the plants.

A grouping is suggested which separates the London clay from the Lower ]*]ocene

and brackets it with the Lower Bagshot beds as a Middle Eocene. The middle
Bagshot series forms the Upper Eocene, while the Upper Bagshot may remain a
member of the same formation or find a place in the Lower Oligocene.

     The great change in climate which took place between the Lower and ^liddle
Eocene as thus grouped, and which led to the migration of the older eocene floras

towards the pole, is pointed out, as well as the constant presence of a great river

in our area flowing from west to east throughout the whole Eocene period. While
ihe Lower Eocene and London clay depressions travelled from east to west and
caused an advance of the North Sea, the middle Bagshot depressions commenced in
tlie south-west and led to an incursion of a southern sea, and also caused the
liver delta to shift south-west to Hampshire. In the Barton period the two seas
united temporarily. The temperature began to decrease after the Headon period.

5. On the Classification of Oligocene Strata in the Hampshire Basin. By

                                       J. W. Elwes.

    The base of the Headon series at Long Mead End, Ilordle, contains Cerithium
concaimm. At the top of the series a marine bed has been observed, which may be
correlated with the Colwell Bay Venus-bed. The latter can be traced to the edge
of Warden Clifl", and a similar Venus-bed is observed in Headon Hill. The author
supports the view that the Colwell and Headon Venus-beds are one zone. He has

observed the presence of Cerithium concaviwi and C. ventricosujii above the marine
bed at Colwell, as at Headon,
540 EKPORT-- 1882.

     Professor Judd'a list of Brockenhurst fossils contains 62 species from Oolwell,
not occurring' at Brockenhurst; and 107 species from Brockenhurst, not found at
Oolwell ; while only '20 are recorded from both localities. This does not read like
a list of species from one formation.

     At Ileadon occur about 30 per cent., at Oolwell about 3'j, and at Brockenhurst

(omitting corals) about 62 per cent, of species from below the Ileadon series.
Professor Judd concluded that only |th of the Brockenliiu-st species occiu* in beds
below the Headon series.

     At,Whiteclitf a representative of the Venus-bed at Oolwell occurs, and below
it a representative of the Brockenhurst bed containing 69 marine species. Of
these 51 occur at Brockenhurst, and 53-6 per cent, of them in beds below the
ileadon series. These numbers are gathered from Messrs. Keeping and Tawney's
lists. The occurrence of abundance of CeritJiium concavum at Whitecliti' above
the marine beds has quite recently been observed by Mr. Keeping.

     The author concludes that there is only one middle marine group in the Headon

series, with two zones of fossils, the Brockenhurst zone being the lower. He offers,

as an explanation of the difficulty of correlating these beds with the continental,
if the presence be admitted of C. concavum above the Brockenhurst marine bed,
the suggestion that in the Hampshire area this species lived after as well as
before the deposition of these beds, though apparently it did not survive the depo-
sition on the Continent of the equivalent series of the Lower Tongrian.

    He supports Professor Judd in obliterating the group called the Osborne series,

chiefly on the ground of the dilKculty of tinding any natural line between it and
the Upper Headon, but would class these beds with the Headon series, not with

the Bem bridge.
    He also agrees with Professor Judd in obliterating the line of division made

by Professor Forbes at the Blacit Band at Ilampstead. The natural base of the

--Hampstead series is tliat proposed by Professor Judd viz. the Cerithium band at

the base of the marine beds.

        6. On the Outcrop of the Brochenhurst Bed, near LijndJiurgf.

                                 Bij E."B. Tawney, M.A., F.G.8.

     Fossils characteristic of the rich bed which he had been lately working in tlie
railway cutting near Brockenhurst, were found by ]\Ir. H. Keeping at Outwalk
Hill, Lyndhurst, in 1858. The well at Emery Down, closely adjacent, also yielded
the same fossils in 1863. The excavations which the author had lately carried out
with the assistance of the Kev. J. Oompton of Minstead, on several sides of this
hill show the succession of the beds to be, at the base of the hill. Upper Bagshot
.sands, next in ascending order freshwater Lower Headon, marine Brockenhurst
bed, Valuta {/eutinata zone, followed by beds not explored, but concluding with
the freshwater Osborne marls at the top'of the hill. The succession is therefore the
.same as at Whiteclift" Bay.

     The thickness of beds between the freshwater Lower Headon and the Osbjrne
marls is about 100 feet. The Brockenhurst bed yielded a few of its characteristic
fossils, but near the outcrop these are weathered, or have entirely perished. It
seems hopeless to expect well-preserved fossils in pits of less than 20 feet deep.

     In conclusion tiie discovery of the freshwater Upper Ileadon beds in the
Roydon brickyard by Mr. II. Keeping, was announced. They are found to be at
least 7 feet thick, and contain layers rich in Potamo)nija plana.

  7. On Subsidence as the Efect of Acciimulaiion. J?^ Charles Ricketts,

the deposition of sedimentary strata has been in progress, there has been simul-

taneously a subsidence of the earth's crust; though hut little eiJbrt has been made

to determine whether they are dependent on each other as cause and effect.

Borings in deltas prove that depression to a great extent has occurred whilst

the accumulation was being deposited. The greater amount of detritus derived

from hills and valleys is canied into the sea, but. instead of filling it up, the water

becomes of a great depth at a few miles from the mouths of large rivers.

There was a progressive  subsidence  of the  land during the  Glacial period                                                                                                                                                                                                      this

may be ascribed to the weight of accumulated snow, and of the newly-formed

boulder-clay ; a similar depression is occurring in Greenland, under a rapid increase

of snow.

limestone and the beds of coal furnishing sufficiently correct base-lines for deter-

mining the question. Near its southern boundary in Coalbrookdale, the carboni-

ferous limestone is overlaid by millstone grit, the thickness of which, as well as of

the coal-measures, is there very inconsiderable, compared with localities in Den-

bighshire and Lancashire. There is also apparent in numerous instances, even

within a distance of a few miles, a considerable difference in the thickness of the

strata between identical beds of coal. The most remarkable example recorded is

that of the 'Thick,' or 'Ten-yard' coal of Dudley, which, from thirty feet of

coal, and with two to four feet of ' partings,' has five miles towards the north

separated into ten or twelve beds of coal, which combined are of the same thick-

ness, but with the intermediate measures amount to 406 feet. {Jukes.)

There must needs be a cause for this universal occurrence of subsidence with

deposition of strata, the only ethcient one being the weight of the accumulated

material pressing down the crust of the earth resting upon a iluid substratum.

     Elevation also happens on the removal of pressure, and 'those regions which
have suffered the greatest amount of denudation have been elevated most-'
{Captain Button, U.S. Ordnance Survey.)

     At the termination of the Glacial period, the land, depressed b)' its load of
snow, became, upon this melting away, re-elevated to a certain extent. This, and
the rising of the land at the preseut time in Norway and Spitzbergen, may be

attributed to the removal of a thick covering of snow.
     In elevated districts the highest parts are those in which there has been the

greatest amoimt of denudation, and often consist of the lowest rocks in a geological
series. Thus in North Derbyshire the highest laud is composed of carboniferous
limestone, from above which more than o,0(J0 feet of later carboniferous strata have

been removed.
     The author thinks that these depressions and elevations cannot be ascribed to

secular cooling of the mass of the earth, since by such action the accumulation
cannot also be accounted for ; nor could the same agency acting only in one direction

cause both depression and upheaval.
     The concurrent phenomena of accumulation and subsidence, and their converse,

demand serious and careful investigation ; especially as in them may be found

the great moving-power upon which depends the greater number of geological

changes.

               8. On the Cause of Elevation and Siihsidence of Land.
                                By J. S. Gardner, F.G.S.

     The paper c'aims that tlie evidence of the permanence of continents is iacon-
clusive as regards eocene and prre-eocene periods, and inquires what the shallower
regions of the Atlantic mean, if they do not mean a change of level at tlie .sea-
bottom. Assuming, with Sir C. Lyell, that at a given depth rocks are molten, and
that under further pressure they are reconverted into solids of high specitic gravity,
the paper demonstrates that the outer envelojie is susceptible to and gives way under
any increased weight, and recovers when tliis is removed. The evidence relied upon

is that of coral isles, lava-flows, accumulations of ice, and of sediment in deltas,
estuaries, and along sea-coasts. In these cases, unless there are counteracting
ao-ents, subsidence invariably follows, and littoral seas are thus areas of depression.
The increasing pressure in deep oceanic basins acting on the fluid layer leads to the

elevation of lines of least resistance into ridges or dry-land, these lines generally

coinciding with coast-lines, and to volcanic outbursts. Geologj' demands pre-eocene
communication between many lands. Tlie elevation of land continuous between
Europe and America in the north, during the Middle Eocene, was coincident with
a cessation in the great formation of basalt, and its subsidence with a renewal of
this. The conclusion is drawn that irregularities of surface have and will continue
to become more and more accentuated.

The duty of examining the physical structure of the cliffs on eitlier side the

Straits pf Dover, and of collecting all the data necessary for the purposes of a

myCliannel Tiiimel, having fallen to  lot, I think it not inopportune to lay the results

of mv inquiry before this meeting of the British Association. I will first of all

deal with the English dirt's.

         T/ie fiectinn of the JEnr/lish Cliffs.

The rocks exposed in the cliffs between Folkestone and St. Margaret's consist ot

the following in descending order :

Nos. "VI., v., IV. constitute the upper chalk with flints, and III., 11., I. constitute

the lower chalk of the English geologists.

The Gault A, a stiff" blue clay and impervious, forms the low line of cliffs, on

the west side of Eastwear Bay, and disappears below low-water mark opposite the
Abbot's cliff" tunnel. It has been struck at St. Margaret's Bay in the deep boring at

about 5;J6 feet below O. I).

The lowest bed of the chalk. No. 1., the chalk marl No. 1 of Price, is a clayey

calcareous deposit generally impervious, but in some places containing so much

((jlauconite) sand, that it allows of the percolation of water. The sand gradually

disappears in the upper layers, as far as the hard rocky chalk, which forms the base

of chalk marl No. 2 of Price. From this point up to the top of the grey chalk,
there is no great change in the physical character. The calcareous element, how-

ever, increases, and the clayey element diminishes. I have therefore in the preced-

in<r table grouped the chalk marl No. 2 of Price with the grey chalk, under the head-

of No. II., the difference being merely a palaeontological one, the former being
Acharacterised by reefs of fossil sponges {Flocosci/phia mceandrina).
                                                                       well-marked

yellow band forms the upper boundary, defining it from the lower white chalk
without flints.

     The lower white chalk without flints No. III. is composed at its base, of a hard
nodular chalk, the grit-hed of Price, and it becomes .softer and whiter as far as the
flrst layers of flint, which form the arbitrary line of demarcation, between the lower
and upper chalk. The latter, comprising Nos. IV., Y., VI., looser in texture and more
calcareous than the beds below, needs no special comment in this place. Tlie
beds dip steadily to the eastward at a low angle, so that the base of the clitt's
to the west of Dover is composed of the lower beds, and to the eastward of the

upper.

                                                    The French Cliffs.

     The cliffs between St. Pot and Sangatte reproduce all the characters of those
between Folkestone and Dover, the subdivisions being easily ideiitified, and the
thickness of No. II. being very nearly unchanged. The beds, too, dip to the east,
but at a higher angle.

     The continuity of these rocks beneath the Channel is proved by the researches
of the French Channel Tunnel CompanJ^

               Faults and Dislocations.

The next question to be con.sidered is, ' Are these strata broken by faults and

dislocations ? ' Numerous faults and dislocations are to be seen in the English and

French clift's ; but none of them are of great extent. The greatest throw on the
English side, which I have observed, amounts to about eighteen feet, and on the

French to twenty-flve feet. In the lower part of No. II. the faults are closed fis-

sures, not offering free passage to water, a fact proved not merely by the clifl-sec-

tions, but by the results of the experimental tunnel driven along the face of

Shakespeare's Cliff. There they are niereh' dripping lines of weakness, easily stopped

by ordinarj' appliances. On the French side the roclis are more broken, but no

difticulty is experienced in drainage. The faults and dislocations in the beds above

No. II. which form the cliffs to the east of Dover offer generally free passage to

water and are open fissures. In Sir John Ilawkshaw's boring at St. Margaret's

Bay, a fissure three feet deep was met with, at a depth of more than 200 feet

below the sea-level, and full of salt water. It is clear, therefore, that these rocks

are penetrated by open water channels, which underneath the sea draw upon the

salt water. This one, be it remembered, was casually hit upon in a small vertical

Howboring.     many, it may well be asked, are likely to be intersected in a tunnel

some miles long ? They may be expected to prove a most grave element of danger

in the course of working, and to be only made water-tight at a vast expense. Thus

there is a difference of the greatest importance between No. II. and the beds above

it, the faults and fissures which are closed in the one being open, and water-bearing

in the other.

               The Poi'osity of the Beds.

     There is also the same diff"erence to be noted in tlieir porosity, for while the
middle and lower parts of No. II. are, for all practical ])urposes, impervious, away
from faults and dislocations, the beds above No. II. to the east of Shakespeare's

Cliff and to St. Margaret's are highly charged with water, as might be expected from
their being continuous with those which supply London with chalk water. Thev
form one series of water-bearing rocks.

     The impervious character of No. II. is due to the large percentage of clay
mingled with the chalk. Ou analy.sis I find it to be as follows :

     It is clear from the above table that the clay diminishes as we ascend in the
rocks, and that the lower strata of No. II. are the only strata in the series in which
no difficulty is to be looked for, from the percolation of water. The three last ana-
lyses show "that the amount of clay in the rocks penetrated by the tunnel, in front of

the Shakespeare Cliff is very considerable, and that it diminishes as the tunnel rises
to the hio-her beds. This change will be a most valuable index to the position of
the end of the tunnel in carrying on the work in the rocks under the Channel.

     The water locked up in the pores of the strata penetrated by the tunnel is proved

by the analysis of my friend Dr. Angus Smith to be fresh water.

                                                      General Conclusions.

    From the foregoing facts it may be concluded that :--

     1. Tlie lower beds of No. II. (chalk mai-1 2, and the lower part of the grey
chalk) are the only strata in the chalk sufficiently impervious to allow of the con-
struction of a tunnel in the dry.

     2. That the outcrop of No. II. between Folkestone and the Shakespeare Cliff is
the best position for a tunnel, which could strike the lower part of No. II. and
remain in it throughout, so as to join the workings of tlie French Channel Tunnel

Company wliich are being carried on in the same horizon.
     3. That the faults in the lower part of No. II. do not allow of free percolation

of waters, and are not likely to become a serious obstacle to the work.
     4. Tliat the strata above No. II. are so porous, and traversed by open fissures,

that they allow of free access to water, both subaiirial and marine, and therefore

offer great difficulties in the way of the construction of a submarine tunnel which

are not presented by the lower beds of No. II.

        2. On the proposed Channel Tunnels in their Geological Aspects.
                  By C. E. De Range, F.G.S., Assoc. Inst. C.E.

    To those who have not studied the geology of the South-east of England,
it may appear somewhat remarkable that the advocates of the scheme of the
submarine Continental Railway Company state that the grey chalk will be

found to be perfectly dry, while the white chalk will be found to be heavily charged
with water, requiring constant pumping. But this apparent anomaly disappears

when it is known that the geological horizon called by the East Kent people ' grey
chalk,' is the formation so well linown in Sussex and Hants by the name of the
rhalk marl, long since described by Dr. Manfell, and, still longer ago, in that much
read book ' White's Selborne,' where its great fertility when decomposed into ' white
malm,' and its value for hop- and wheat-growing purposes, is discoursed on.

     The chalk marl of East Kent ditfers in no resiJect from the chalk marl of other
parts of the country, in being practically waterle.*s, and being the nearly imper-

meable material that supports the wonderful supplies of water given by the Avbite

chalk in many areas, amongst others, the area pumped hy the Kent Water-

works, east of London, which raise about ten million gallons daily, and could

easily double that quantity ; while the chalk marl, in deep borings at many loca-
lities, has been found to be absolutely waterless, as at Kentish Town, Ilai-wich,

Southampton.

The Cliffs at Lydden Spout were measured by Mr. F. G. Jlilton Price and

myself in 187G, and were described by Mr. Price in a paper on the beds between tlie

gault and upper clialk near Folkestone.' The height at this point was found to be

433 feet aboye the mean sea-leyel, and the thickness between the upper gault and

first bed of flints (the upper chalk) to be 348 feet.

Of this thickness the lower white chalk forms the upper 150 feet ; the upper

part of this is the crate manieuse, and the lower part, the craie noduleuse, a

I. labiatus of Dr. Barrois ; the whole belongs to the Turonien of D'Orbigny
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

the lower 32 feet is the zone of Cardiaster pygmaus of JMr. Price, and is the ' grit

bed ' of local geologists, from its hardness being sufficient to turn the point of a

pickaxe ; the mass of the bed is made of comminuted fragments of inoceranii and
other fossils. The overlying bed is soft, but is not so pure a white as the upper

chalk; water can freely percolate through it, but it is doubtful whether much can

pass through the underlying 'grit bed.'

Beneath is the junction bed, or zone of Bdemnifes pleinis of Mr. Price, four feet

in thickness : it is of soft texture, and dark yellowish colour, and is of a poorer

character. Below the junction bed is the grey chalk, 169 feet 9 inches thick, the

upper 55 feet in the zone of Belemnites  idenus  of Dr.  Barrois                                       the lower 93 feet is

the craie argileme avec bancs durs d ammonites rhotomagensis. The next 2 feet

9 inches is the well-marked ' cast bed,' which is marked and striped with mottlings

of a darker colour ; it contains a remarkable assemblage of fossils, which have some-

what of a gault facies, and it essentially marks the horizon of springs in this area

through it runs and issues the strong spring at Abbot's cliff, known as the Lydden

Spout, this formerly drove a water-wheel, giving the power required for a whiting

manufactory which once existed at the foot of the cliff; in later times it has pro-

vided water for the locomotives of the South-Easteru Railway.

Below the ' cast bed' is 19 feet of marly chalk, forming the zones oi Ammonites

rhotomagensis and A. varians of Dr. Barrois.

Beneath the marly bed forming the base of the ' grey chalk ' is the chloritic, or

rather glauconitic marl ; it is traversed by hard reefs of sponges, which are occa-

sionally converted into iron-pyrites, and are more or less entangled with the bones

of Ichthyosaurus ; it is the craie marneuse, with Flocoscyphia mmandrina of Dr.

Barrois.

At Copt Point, the chloritic marl rests upon more sandy beds, which have beea

believed to represent the upper green sand of more western areas ; but, according to

Mr. Price and to Dr. Bari-ois, the facies it presents does not correspond with the upper

green sand of the West of England, but is essentially a part of the facies of the

chalk marl, and Mr. Price regards these sandy beds as the base of the chalk-marl,

and calls it the zone of Stauronema Carteri ; it is the equivalent of Pecten cwper of

Dr. Barrois, and on the horizon of the Warminster beds.

In Normandy M. Hubert classes the grey chalk and sandy beds as cenomauien,

which he divides into three subdivisions :

     The water absorbed by the porous white chalk of North-East Kent, from the
annual rainfall, follows the dip planes of the strata, and must circulate in the white
chalk under the sea ; and should the water be artificially abstracted in making the
proposed tunnel in St. Margaret's Bay, it must inevitably affect the existing water

the chalk, the latter will come into the condition in which it can absorb the waters
of the sea ; the amount so absorbed is limited by the degree of porosity of the
chalk, but even if the amount be only one million gallons per day, for each mile of
tunnel driven, it must inevitably very seriously afl'ect the construction of a tumiel

5. On the Southampton Artesian Well. By T. W. Shore, F.C.S., and

                                         E. Westlake, F.G.S.

    In bringing; forward this subject on behalf of the town, we place before the
Section such details as we hope may enable them to form aa opinion on a

question of much local importance, viz., whether it is possible, by an extension of

the existing well, to utilise it as a source of supply to the town.

The amomit of water yielded by the well, on the last occasion of pumping, in

1851, was 130,000 gallons per day. The quantity at present supplied to the town

from the Itchen is from three to three and a-half million gallons, but this is a

much larger quantity per head than is foimd to be sufficient for towns under a

regulated system of supply. It thus appears that the well yields about one twenty-

fifth part of the quantity required.

For the purpose of increasing the yield two methods are suggested. One of

these is, to drive galleries or drift-waj"s in the chalk. The other, to continue the

boring through the chalk into the upper and lower greensands.

   We will first describe the present condition of the well, and then refer to the

probable nature of the strata below the point reached by the boring.

The work of excavation was carried on from July 1838 till February 1851, at a

total cost of 19,000/., and reached a total depth of 1,317 ft.

   A well was sunk by means of iron cylinders and brickwork, through 464 ft. of

the tertiary beds. The diameter is 13 ft. at the top, and diminishes by successive

stages to 7 ft. in the lower portion.

The beds passed through consist of: 2 ft. of soil; 74 ft. of lower Bagshot

beds, consisting of sand and clay in alternations ; 304 ft. of London clay, consisting

of sandy clay, with seams of water-bearing sand, and pebble-beds towards the top
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

84 ft. of plastic clay, with the usual bed of greensand at the base. The chalk was

reached at a depth of 464 ft., where the masonry was terminated. The 7-ft. shaft

Awas continued 90 ft. in the chalk.    boring was then made with a six and a-half

inch auger to a further depth of 754 ft., making a total of 853 ft. in the chalk, or

1,317 from the surface. The chalk is stated to have contained Hints, all but the last

10 ft. The bottom 15 ft. of the tlinty chalk is described as blue and cloggy. The

last 10 ft. contained veins of clay, and were very cloggy.

At this point the boring was stopped, the cost at that time being twice

as great as it is at present, and the report of ftlr. Hanger, the consulting

engineer, being unfavourable to its continuance.

The moutli of the well is 140 ft. above the level of the sea, and the water stands

at present at 40 It. below the surface of the ground.

Most of the water appears to come from the chalk. Previous to the commence-

ment of the boring in 1842, 20,000 gallons per day were raised ; in 1 844, after con-
siderable progress had been made in boring, this increased to 50,000 galkins

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

and finally, in September 1851, to 130,000 gallons. The chalk thus supplies about

five-sixths of the whole quantity.

In connection with the method of increasing the yield of a chalk well by driving

galleries, we give a few particulars of the Brighton Waterworks, as an example of

the application of this method to the supply of a large town.

Those who know the Brighton Downs will be aware that the rain forms no

иsurface streams. It is entirely absorbed, and passes to the sea through fissures in

the body of the chalk. Since the chalk is as retentive as it is absorbent, it seems

probable that the drainage in chalk districts takes place almost entirely bj^ means

of these fissures. In the Brighton Works the fissures are found to follow tlie dip

of the beds. They vary in size, up to a few inches in width, but are generally not

more than tliree-fourths of an inch. The sides of these fissures are usually of the

colour of mahogany, caused by the infiltration of small particles of the upper clays,

and are polished by the continual friction of the water.

The plan adopted at Brighton is to sink wells, and drive tunnels or adits at the

bottom of these wells in a direction parallel to the strike, so as to cut as many as

possible cf the fissures and intercept the water before flowing to the sea. In the

                                       NN2

tunnels at Goldstone Bottom two enormous fissures -were pierced at about IGO feet
Hdistant, each of whicli delivered at once quite
                                                  million gallons per day. The

total length of the tunnels at Brighton is 4,200 feet, or four-fifths of a mile. The

quantity supplied is about 3 million gallons per day, hut the amount that can

be pumped daily without exhausting the wells is not less than 8 millions.^

Appljing these fncts to the case of the Southampton Well, it is obvious that

the extent of the chalk north of Southampton is much greater than that to the
north of Brighton. And if, as is probable, the rainfall on this area (about 1,000

square miles) is onlj^ partially accounted for by the rivers which flow through it,

it follows that a portion must escape to the sea by permeating through the mass

of the chalk ; and if, as elsewhere, this permeation takes place along vertical

fissures, there may be plenty of water in the chalk beneath Southampton, although

little has been found by boring, for the chance of hitting one of these fissui'es by a

bore-hole, 6^ inches in diameter, is obviously very small.

    We have now to consider the beds below the point reached by the boring.

With reference to the depth of the Upper Greensand. The only place where

the chalk has been penetrated in the Hampshire Basin is at Chichester. It is there

790 feet thick. In the Southampton well 850 feet have already been passed through.

Since the chalk becomes thinner towards the west we might have expected that

the thickness at Southampton would have been less than at Chichester. At any

rate this consideration, taken with the fact that the boring is now in chalk with

seams of clay (doubtless the lower part of the chalk marl), renders it probable that

the chalk is now nearly peneti-ated, and that of the 20 to 50 feet estimated by Mr.

Ranger as still remaining to be pierced, the smaller estimate is the more probable.

The thickness of the upper greensand in Compton Bay and the Isle of Wight

generally is 150 feet, and the gault 100 feet. At Devizes and Swindon, Mr.

Prestwich gives the same thicknesses. Phillips also gives the gault west of

Devizes at 80 feet. At Petersfield the greensand and malmrock is 80 feet and the

gault 100. In the Vale of Wardour, Mr. Andrews estimates the upper greensand

at about 150 ft. and the gault at 75 ft.

    From these data we infer that the thickness of the upper greensand beneath

Southampton may be taken at from 100 to 150 feet, and that of the gault at about

100. Its area of outcrop extends around Southampton in a roughly elliptical

form, and distant from it from twenty to thirty and forty miles. The extents of th&

different areas in square miles as drawn on the Geological Survey Maps are given

in the following table ; also the average rainfall on the same areas (for which we-
are indebted to numerous local observers). Taking the absorption at one-third of

--the rainfall, the quantity passing underground from each district is as follows :

     "When this Section met here last, Dr. Buckand advised that the levels at -which
the springs from the greensand find their issue should he ascertained, especially
near Petersiield. This we have done, and thence have deduced the approximate
lieight to which the supply from each area may be expected to rise in the well.

The results are as follows :

portions of silicic acid and clay. Thus the great clay-deposits of the earth's crust

indicate a correspondingly large quantity of silica -which has been carried in solu-

tion into the sea. That sea-water contains but the merest trace of silica, proves

how effectually it is removed by sponges, radiolaria, and diatoms, in the formation

of their siliceous skeletons, and there is no other way in which solid silica can be

deposited in the open sea than through organic agency. Since modern calcareous

ooze always contains a certain percentage of siliceous skeletons, it has been con-

cluded that these were also present in the ancient ooze of the chalk ; since they

have disappeared from the chalk as it now exists, while flints have made their ap-

pearance, it has been suggested that the latter have originated by the transforma-

tion of the former. This conclusion has been confirmed by the observations of the

author, who, together with Zittel, has shown that the silica of siliceous organisms

has by no means the insolubility which has till recently been attributed to it ; and

next by researches of the author on incompletely formed flints, which have shown

that the flrst step in their formation is the replacement of a certain quantity of

chalk by silica, the cocco-liths, foramiuiferal and other calcareous shells becoming

siliceous pseudomorphs, which retain all the markings, even to the very finest, of the

Aoriginal tests.                      further quantity of silica is next deposited, filling up the chambers

oftheforaminifera and tlie interstices of the siliceous chalk; in this way a white

or grey flint is produced. If silica continues to penetrate the nodule and to be de-

posited in it, the grey flint loses its opacity and whiteness, and becomes converted

Ainto black translucent flint.        nodule is seldom, however, uniformly black through-

out, certain portions remain in the previous grey-flint stage, forming light-coloured

spots and blotches on a dark ground ; if the white and black flint form alter-

Anate layers, then we have the phenomenon of 'banded' flint.                                       specimen in

the Bristol Museum shows tlie formation of banded flint in an exceptionally clear

way                      the  centre  remains in the  ' white '  stage,  the  exterior is black ;  between the
                      ;

two is a region of agate-like bands of black and wliite flhit, the white bands,

terminating at their ends as irregular capes or promontories, which project into

the black flint : while continuing their direction, are little outlying islands of white

flint, which exactlj' resemble the spots and blotches of an ordinary black nodule.

An examination of this specimen renders it clear that the nodule was originally

grey throughout, silica continuing to enter it from without converted the exterior

into black flint ; but the process having stopped short of completion the centre

remained unchanged, while between the centre and the exterior the intermediate

zone remains in an intermediate state as banded flint. Thus the grey, banded, and

-- --black flizits the distinction between which has long been recognised are shown

to be but so many dift'erent stages of one and the same process.

     Attention is directed to the scanty information existing with reference to these

islands and the field of research thej' offer. McCulloch, Ansted, Liveing, have

written on them, but much remains unknown.
    The age of the rocks may be archsean, but requires fixing, and their relations

to surrounding areas have still to be made out.
     The stratigraphy of the separate islands has been worked out by Liveing, fully

for Sark, partially for other islands, but his results require confirmation and
extension. The mutual relations of Sark and Guernsey are given, but the rest are
entirely unknown.

     Tlie petrology of the main masses has been partially treated, but more infor-
mation is needed, and the dykes and yeins are undescribed. They are interesting

and varied. Among them is true mica trap.

     The physical geology has been admirably treated by Ansted.
    The islands offer a held for the investigation of the distinctive characteristics
of dykes, veins, &c., and the study of archsean rocks.

2. Notes on Alpine Post-Oarbonifermis (^Dt/assic) and Triassic Geology. By

                          the Rev. A. Irving, B.Sc, B.A., F.G.S.

This paper is intended to call the attention of English geologists to the most

recent results obtained in Alpine geology by such observers as Giimbel, Von Hauer,

Mojsisovics, Theobald, Zittel, and Pichler (not to mention others), and so to sup-

plement the author's papers recently published in the ' Geological Magazine ' on the

Post-carboniferous and Triassic systems. Some recent observations by the author

of the paper are also contained herein.

Of the Post-carboniferous (Dyassic) system, observation so far has failed to

detect the presence of any deposits on the north side of the crystalline axis of the

Alpine chain ; the triassic strata rest at once upon metamorphosed rocks of Silurian

age (Von Hauer). On the south side the principal deposits are comprehended

imder the term Ven-ucano (grey and red-brown conglomerates and breccias, with

red sandstones, and occasional thin beds of lignite or coal). Views as to the

true horizon of these beds are as yet divided ; Von Hauer refers them to the

lowest division of the Trias, at the same time admitting the propriety of Giimbel's

view, that they may be the equivalents of the Rothliegende of Germany. The

latter wiiter even considers that strata analogous to the Zechstein of Germany may

be recognised in the Alps.

The enormous displaj' of volcanic activity recorded in the Rothliegende of

Germany is foimd repeated in the Alps in Post-carboniferous times. As an illus-

tration of this the author gives some observations made within the last few weeks

on the interstratification of ancient acid lava-flows (so-called porphyries) and

bedded volcanic ' ash ' of the Rittner Horn, one of the former centres of activity

which produced the ' porphyries ' of the Bozeu district, the most extensive known
in the world. The mountain is a true ' stratified cone,' preserving at its summit

about a half of its ancient crater-walls. It is a remarkable illustration of the pro-

priety of classifying the 'porphyries' among the 'Older Eruptive Rocks,' as

--maintained some time ago by Creduer.
      Transition Beds. Giimbel considers the dark BeUerophon-limeatonQ of the

Puster Thai, as well as the Griidner sandstone at Neumarkt, near Bozen, the

white Schwaz limestone in the Inn Thai, and some other deposits to be properly

placed here, though others woidd place them in the Dyas. Their organic remains,

he remarks, do not give them ' a pure Dyassic character, but very much more that

of a transition series from the Dyas to the Trias ' (vide Anleitung zu geologischen

Beohachtungen in den Alpen).

  -- --Alpine Trias. Sections of these deposits one on the north slope, through the
--Steinernes Meer, near Saalfelden (after Mojsisovics) another on the south across

the valley of St. Gassian (taken by the author within the last few weeks), are

described, and their correlation pointed out, in order to illustrate the completeness

of the Triassic system as developed in the Alps, the clear sequence which has been

established among its sub-formations, and the soundness therefore of the view

propounded by Professor Oredner, and quoted by the author in another place, that

the key to the true geological history of Triassic times is to be found in the

Alpine Trias.

The importance of the views maintained by so high an authority as Professor

Giimbel as to the  transition  character of  certain  deposits  is  insisted  xipon                       at the
                                                                                                       ;

same time hasty judgment, while awaiting (for a few years) the results of more

extended observations, is deprecated.

4. Notes on the Geology and Mining of the United States of Colombia, S. A.

                                By Robert B. White.

     Tliese notes refer specially to the States of Cauca and Antioqnia, whieli
comprise the country between the 1st and bth degrees of north latitude, and extend
from 120 to 150 miles eastward from the Pacific coast. The eastern and western
chains of the Andes, which run from south to north through this region, are distinct
hi their general characters. The eastern chain is almost all volcanic, whilst in tlie
western there are no volcanoes north of the 2ud degree, and the rest of the Cordil-
lera is composed of granites, granitoid rocks, and diorites. The upheaval of the
eastern chain has raised the strata of the Cretaceous formation to a height of
8,000 feet above the sea-level ; but on the western slopes of the western range
these strata are found only a few hundred feet above the sea, and are almost

undisturbed.

     Eruptions of igneous rocks have taken place in all ages between the two chains
of mountains, and the rocks of the valley of the river Cauca, which with its tributaries
occupies the space enclosed by the two Cordilleras, are metamorphosed and crystal-
lised to an extraordinary degree.

     The formation of an immense number of metalliferous veins seems to be the
natural result of this development of igneous rocks.

     The sedimentary strata are Laurentian, Silurian, Jurassic, Cretaceous, Tertiary,
and Post-tertiary. The Cretaceous beds contain good coal, limestone, and iron
ores. The Post-tertiary alluviums are nearly all auriferous, but although the
upper beds have been worked, the bed rock or old river channels have not yet been
sought after. It is probable that they are as rich as those of California. In recent
alluviums in the valley of the Cauca, remains of Mastodons have been found under
circumstances which indicate that tliese animals were coexistent with man. Pla-
tinum, iridium, molybdenum, copper, lead, and zinc are found in workable quan-
tities. G-old and silver are very abundant, and are the only metals mined for. It

is not a fact that platinum has ever been found in a lode in Colombia, but the author
 has recently found iridium in appreciable quantity in a gold lode in the State of

 Antioqnia. Diamonds are known to exist. liubies and sapphires of large size are

 to be found in abundance in the State of Cauca, but the natives have not tried to
 turn this wealth to account.

      The gold-mining is very interesting. Besides being found in the alluviums, gold

              _

 exists in lodes of all ages, from the oldest granites up to a post-cretaceous period.
 The formation of gold and silver lodes in most abundance took place after the cre-
 taceous period. In other countries the gold veins are usually confined to a limited
 group of rocks. The Silurian is usually considered to be the principal formation
 for gold, but in Columbia it is quite of secondary importance, although no doubt a
 great part of the alluvial gold was derived from the denudation of the older rocks
 which was effected upon the grandest scale imaginable. There is a great difference
 in the standard or fineness of the gold, according to its age, and the oldest gold is
 the best. It is found ranging from twelve to twenty-three and a half carats fine.
 According to the age of the lodes diflerent metals are predominant in their associa-
 tion with the gold. In the oldest lodes copper is most common, and in the newest

lead is the principal companion of the precious metals. When pyrites and galena

 are plentiful in a well-constituted auriferous lode, it is generally found that the gold
 will rather increase than diminish in quantity as the workings deepen. But lodes

which are not well-mineralised are most often richest on the surface. Common
arsenical pyrites is not a good companion for gold when it is not accompanied by

 other sidphides. Pyrites is a general companion of gold, but it is not every class
 of pyrites that is so, and lodes of different ages are characterised by different classes
 of pyrites. There are also several varieties of galena, which are more or less
TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  553

favourable as associates of gold and silver. Gold is not found in combination with
any metal except tellurium. Instances are found in wbich it would appear that
wlien the pj'rites in a gold lode has decomposed, some gold bas been dissolved by
the permeating waters and has again been crystallised in the cavities of the quartz,
in a form distinct from that in which it existed previously. It is remarkable that a
pyrites containing manganese is always a good matrix for gold. In some lodes there
is evidence of the quartz having been formed first, and the metalliferous contents
afterwards. Such lodes are very irregular in their yield. Carbonate of lime is a
rare gangue for gold, but where it does occur it is very productive. The great

variety of the lodes in Colombia enables the miner to acquire so many data for com-

parison, that he is able to distinguish the trustworthy Irom the untrustworthy lodes

with a certainty perhaps unknown in other countries.

The President delivered the following Address :

On the Growth of our Knoivledge of the Function of Secretion, to which is

     prefixed a Brief Sketch of the Writings of the late Professor Francis
     Maitland Balfour.

"WwES the Council of the British Association did me the honour of asking me to

preside over this Section, it occurred to me that a suitable subject for the presidential

address would be a Survey of the Growth of our Knowledge oi the Function of Secre-

tion                       for no subject, which has recently been the object of minute  study by animal
                        ;

physiologists, is more likely to interest all devoted to biological pursuits, however

diverse. I accordingly propose to direct your attention, for the greater part of

the time at our disposal to-day, to what appear to me to be the most important and

the most interesting of the researches bearing on this subject.

Before, however, entering upon the proper subject of this address, it would ill

become me as president of this Section were I not to speak to you, however imper-

fectly, of two great losses which we have sustained, and which have saddened, and

still sadden, the hearts of many of us. The year 1882 will long be memorable, and

sadly memorable, as a year during which English biology sustained irreparable

losses. So much has lately been written' concerning that veteran in science, Charles

Darwin, who will figure in the history of the human intellect with such men as

Socrates and Newton, that I feel no words of mine are needed to add to your

sentiments of admiration and respect. He has made for himself an imperishable re-

putation as one of the subtlest, most patient, and most truthful observers of natural

phenomena. His powers as an observer were, however, almost surpassed by his

ingenuity as a reasoner, and his power to frame the hypotheses most apt, in the actual

state of science, to reconcile all the facts which came within the range of his

Weobservation.             remember the time when the name of Charles Darwin, and the

mention of the theories connected with his name, awakened, on the part of many,

sentiments of antagonism and of unreasonable opposition. But we have Uved to

witness, what I may term, a great reparation. Even those who did not know the

man, and the qualities of mind and heart which endeared him to so many, have

come to recognise that in his work he was actuated by a single-hearted desire

to discover the truth ; and, after calm reflection, they have conceded that his studies

and his views. Tike all studies and all views which are based upon the truth, not

only are notu-reconcilable with, but add to our conceptions of, the dignity and glory

of God. And here I may be allowed to remark that it is impossible to study the

writings of Darwin, and especially the one in which he treats of ' The Descent of

Man,' without recognising an undercurrent of reverent sentiment, which in one or

mtwo places finds expression words telling us that man differs from the animal

creation, if not in physical characteristics which cannot be bridged over, at least

in moral attributes and iij the ' ennobling belief in God,' by his power of forming

                                                                                                          I

that conception of the Deity which, to use Darwin's own words, is ' the gi-and idea
of God hating sin and loving righteousness.'

    We cannot help mourning for our great ones, though thej^ he taken from us

in the fulness of years, and when their labours have been so numerous and so pro-
ductive that we marvel that they have been able to achieve so much within the
span of a single life ; but our grief is immeasurably greater when the man of
genius is taken from us in the plenitude of strength, as it were upon the threshold

of a life full of extraordinary promise.
     Francis Maitland Balfour, whose sudden death has so recently cast a gloom over

us all, was a man who appeared destined to advance oiu- knowledge of animal develop-

ment more than it had been advanced by the labours of any one of his predecessors.
His death recalls the train of thought which we have pursued when reflecting

upon the lives and works of such men as Mayowand Bichat, Gerhardt and Clifford.
It so much could be achieved in so short a life, what great benefits would science

not have derived, what remarkable steps in advance might not have been made, had
it been given to these great minds to work on for the good of their race during a
lifetime of ordinary length. It must be sufficient for us that it was destined other-

wise ; and, in mourning for our departed friend, we may at least i-eflect that we would
not have had him less worthy of our admiration in order that we might mourn

him the less.

           The Researches of Feancis Maitland Balfour.

    At the risk of having to be somewhat brief in my discussion of the subject

proper of this address,! must yield to the impulse which leads me to give you some

account of Balfour's work.-

     Having been educated at Harrow, Balfour entered Trinity College, Cambridge,
in the year 1870. His i'riend and master, Michael Foster, has told us how, from

the very first, besides engaging in systematic studies which he was able to pursue
with no small degree of success, he devoted himself with passion to original re-
search. At the very outset Balfour engaged in work which led to speculations of
a fundamental and far-seeking nature, and of the three embryological papers^ which
he wrote before taking his degree, two related to questions which occupied his
attention in a special manner to the end. One of these, ' On the Development and
Growth of the Layers of the Blastoderm,' contains several statements not afterwards

maintained ; for instance, as to the independent origin of the mesoblast in the chick,
where it is said ' neither to originate from the epiblast nor from the hypoblast, but
to be formed coincidentally with the latter, out of apparently similar segmentation

cells.' The other, ' On the Disappearance of the Primitive Groove in the Chick,'

calls attention to, and corroborates Dursy's discovery of seven years before, and
closes with a suggestion of the great hypothesis (afterwards elaborated) that the
primitive streak is a lingering remnant of the blastopore. Balfour also wrote,

whilst an undergraduate, ' On the Development of the Blood-vessels in the Chick,'
but it may be doubted whether he advanced our knowledge of this obscure

subject.

     The ' Elements of EmLryolngy,' by Michael Foster and Balfour, appeared (1874)
shortly after Balfour had taken his degree (1878), and Foster has generously
recorded how great was the part his pupil took in the production of this book.

tion ^ of the primitive character of this group was that increased interest should
attach to all researches on its embrj^ology. To an introductory account of the
embryology of Elasmobranchs - Balfour o^Yed, I believe, his fellowship at Trinity
College, and from that time onwards until 1878 he pursued the investigation at

ANaples and in Cambridge. The collected results appeared in 1878, as ' Mono-

graph on the Development of Elasmobranch Fishes.' No research upon a limited

group ever contained more numerous or more wide generalisations, extending over

the whole domain of vertebrate embryology. I may dwell for a few moments upon

some of its most interesting sections.

    The structures which we are now familiar with as ' head-cavities ' are described

for the first time, and named ; their relation to the cranial nerves and their resem-
blance or equivalence to the muscle plates of the body are pointed out ; and Balfoiu-
seizes upon their value in throwing light upon the great problems of the segmen-
tation of the head and the segmental value of the cranial nerves. In particular
the 5th nerve and the 7th, with the auditory, are specified as the segmental nerves
of the mandibular and hyoid segments. The short, but very important, notice of
the sympathetic system showed that its ganglia developed on branches of the
spinal nerves, and that it was therefore a product of the epiblast.^ The primitive
feature? of the mesoblast and notocord and their hypoblastic origin are de-
scribed,'' and furnish material for the comparison afterwards instituted in the
 'Comparative Embryology' * between their development in Elasmobranchs and
their still more primitive origin in Amphioxus, as diverticula of the archenteron.

A very able chapter on excretory organs concludes this monograph. This subject

had engaged Balfour's attention very earlj', and his introductory account of Elas-
mobranch Development contains his discovery of segmental organs in Elasmobranchs,

--a discovery made independently but simultaneously by Professor Semper. These

 organs are shown to develop in the mesoblast, and are compared with the seg-
 mental organs of annelids.

    A paper published in 1876 gives a singularly clear and thorough resume of our

 knowledge of the development of the urino-genital system ; and the diagrams there
 given, illustrating the homologies of the male and female urino-genital organs, are
 wonderfully simple and instructive. Shortly after the publication of this paper,
 Balfour became a Fellow of the lloyal Society, from which he received a Royal
 Medal in 1881.

     Among the interesting points that Balfour had made clear in connection with

 the spinal nerves of Elasmobranchs, was the fact that the anterior and posterior

 roots arise alternately, and not in the same vertical plane. He sought for an ex-

 planation of this in Amphioxus at Naples, in 1876. Owsjannikow and Stieda
 had discovered that the nerves of the opposite sides in Amphioxus arise alternately,
 and Stieda further stated that the nerves of the same side arise alternately from the
 dorsal and ventral corners of the cord. Stieda considered that two adjacent nerves
 were together equivalent to a single spinal nerve of higher vertebrates. Balfour *
 found no trace of difierence of level in the origin of nerves on the same side, i.e. he
 denied the existence of ventral or anterior roots ; and afterwards, in investigating
 the cranial nerves of higher vertebrates, and being unable to find any trace of an-
 terior roots, he framed the bold hypothesis ' that the head and trunk had been
 differentiated from each other at a time when mixed motor and sensory posterior
 roots were the only roots present, and that cranial and spinal nerves had been inde-
 pendently evolved from a common ground-plan.

      Balfour's investigation of the development of the ovary was incomplete when
  his work on Elasmobranchs appeared ; and he continued to work at this subject,

Aboth in Elasmobranchs and Mammals, publishing a paper upon it in 1878.^ paper

published in the same year,"on the ' Maturation and Impregnation of Ihe Ovum,'

contained the very ingenious suggestion that the easting out of the polar bodies

prevents the ovum developing by itself into a new individual, i.e. prevents parthe-

nogenesis                                       and Balfour  points  out  that  parthenogenesis  is  practically confined  to
                                             ;

the arthropoda and rotiiera, which are the only two groups in which polar bodies

are not known to occur.

Balfour still continued, now in conjunction with Sedgwick, his researches on the

urino-genital system, and described, among many other new points, the existence

of a head-kidney (pronephros) in the chick.

In this year, Balfour also investigated ^ the earlj' development of Lacerta, and

pointed out the presence of a primitive streak and of a neurenteric canal. This

investigation confirmed his belief in the hypothesis previously quoted that the

primitive streak is the relic of a blastopore.

At this time Balfour was working hard at his text-book of ' Comparative Em-

bryology.' His published papers were no less numerous than before, but consisted
in part of extracts from the more speculative chapters of the forthcoming book.

He, however, published a paper,'* containing the results of work scattered over two

years, on the development of Spiders. He also published a paper * on the skeleton

of the paired fins, based upon his work on Elasmobranchs. In this he contests the

views of Gegenbauer and Huxley, that the primitive fin consists of a central multi-

segmented axis with many lateral v&ja, and is most nearly retained in Ceratodus;

he rather considers the primitive form to be a longitudinal bar running along the

base of the fin (basipterygium), and giving oft' at right angles series of rays which

pass into the fin. He adheres to the view expressed in the ' Elasmobranch Fishes '

(p. 101) that the vertebrate limbs are remnants of two continuous lateral fins.
     Another important paper of the same year dealt with the placenta. Balfour

supposed that in the primitive Placentalia, simple foetal villi, like those of the pig,

projected from the discoidal allantoic region of the chorion into uterine crypts. The

deciduate discoidal placenta of Rodents and Tnsectivores is the first stao-e in
advance of this primitive type. Then along different lines diverge the zonary

placenta of Carnivora, and tbe diffuse placenta of Suidfe, Lemuridfe, &c. ; and the

latter becomes contracted down to the discoidal placenta of man, a form in no way

to be confounded with the primitive discoidal placenta of Rodents.

    He engaged also, in conjunction with Mr. Wm. N. Parker, in a verv important

research, to be published in full in the ' Philosophical Transactions,' on'the 'Struc-

ture and Development of Lepidosteus.' This paper contains an immense amount of
new matter, both anatomical and embryological, and shows that Lepidosteus, though
a true ganoid, has very marked teleostean affinities.

     Balfour's last published paper,Ф which appeared during his recent illness, was
written with the assistance of Mr. Beighton, and related to the germinal layers of
the chick. This paper describes, in a very beautiful way, the double orio-inof the
mesoblast, partly from an axial strip of epiblast in the line of the primitive streak
and partly as two lateral plates differentiated from the hypoblast in front of the

primitive streak.

    Before his last, fatal journey, Mr. Balfour was engaged in preparing a new
edition of the ' Elements of Embryology,' and in producing a vei-y elaborate memoir
on the ' Anatomy and Development of Peripatus.' He had previously investio^ated

that animal, in 1879, and had cleared up the matter of its segmental organs (over-
looked by Moseley), and demonstrated the presence of ganglia on its ventral nerve-

cords.

Mr. Balfour became a member of this Association in 1871, the year after he

entered Trinity College. At the brilliant Belfast meeting in 1874 he read his first

paper before the Association on Elasmobranch Fishes ; and this paper and Balfour's

share in the keen discussion which followed are still remembered with admiration

by many. In 1880, at Swansea, he delivered an address, as Chairman of the sub-
section of Anatomy and Physiology, deaUng with the mutual services rendered by

the evolution theory to erabryolog}', and by embryology to the evolution theory,

with special reference to the developmental history of the nervous system. In

1881, he was appointed one of the two General Secretaries.

But the great text-book of comparative embryology ' is the real monument

of Balfour's fame. It is impossible to com-ey an idea of the merits of this book. It

grappled with the enormous mass of scattered literature iipon the subject, and

formed it all into a consecutive account, clear and accurate. Discordant statements

.were weighed and estimated, frequently brought into harmony by an ingenious ex-

planation or by a new and crucial observation. Countless investigations were repeated

and verified, and countless suggestions of important work, that still remains to be

done, make the book as valuable to the savant as to the student. Among the

chapters ^ most remarkable for broad and philosophic generalisations are those deal-

ing with the ' Ancestral Form of the Ohordata,' ' Larval Forms,' and the ' Origin

and Homologies of the Germinal Layers.' Balfour accepts the gastrula as a stage

in the evolution of the metazoa, and leans somewhat to invagination, as the more

primitive process than delamination in the production of the gastrula. He shows

distinctly that the mesoblast arose in the first instance, not independently, but as a

differentiation from the other two layers, and that the mesoblast is a homologous

structure throughout the triploblastic metazoa. In the chapter on ' Larval Forms '

he gives numerous reasons and arguments for a larval development repeating the

ancestral history, better and more fully than a foetal development ; he reviews the

types of larviB (discriminating six types), the causes tending to produce secondary

changes in larvte, and suggests, as a hypothesis for the passage from the radial to

the bilateral type, that in a pilidium-like larva the oral face elongated unequally,

an anterior part forming a pra3-oral lobe, and a posterior outgrowth the trunk,

while the aboral surface became the dorsal surface. He suggests that adult

Echinodermata have retained, and not secondarily acquired, their radial symmetry,

and considers a radially symmetrical organism, like a medusa, as the prototype of all

the larval forms above the coslenterates. Balfour does not admit the specially close

relationship of the Chordata with the Chretopods, which Dohrn and Semper main-

tain                       but considers that the Chordata descended from a  stock of segmented worms
                        ;

derived from the same unsegmented types as the Chmtopods, but in which two

lateral nerve-cords like those of the nemertines coalesced dorsally instead of ventrally.

He considers that the mouth in ancestral Cliordata was suctorial, and was not

formed, as Dohrn supposes, by the coalescence of two visceral clefts. Finally,

Balfour draws up a scheme of the phylogeny of the Chordata, according to which

the hypothetical protochordata, with a notochord, a suctorial mouth, and very

numerous gill-slits, acquired one by one, A'ertebrte, jaws, an air-bladder, a penta-

dactyl limb, an amnion : each new accession characterising a hypothetical proto-

group, from which some existing group is supposed to have diverged.

    Those of my hearers who had not followed Balfour's scientific labours, but who

merely knew him as one of the most respected workers in the field of biology,

will I trust, even from my brief sketch, have formed some idea of the activity and

originality of his mind, and will understand how his death has occasioned a feeling

almost akin to despair, in that he occupied a place which it appears to us now im-

Howpossible to fill. '     are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished !

                        The Vteivs of the Ancients.

It was known to the ancients that organs of the body exist which are concerned

in the separation from it of excrementitious substances, although the greatest

doubts prevailed as to the organs to which such functions should be ascribed.

Thus we find Hippocrates defining it as characteristic of glands that they occur

in moist parts of the body ; but showing his ignorance of the true relations of

glands tosecretipn by connecting them with the'formation of hairs, and discussino-
the question which we find our own Wharton debating again in the seventeenth

century, and which he formulates, ' Num cerebrum ad glandularum numerum vel

viscerum accedat.' The general opinion of the ancients, and the opinion which

was adopted and taught by Galen, was that the glands were sieves or coUanders

(cola), which served to strain off" from the blood purely excrementitious substances.

The liver and the kidneys were strangely enough removed from the group of glands

and placed amongst the viscera. The first writer who appears systematically to

have treated of the glands was the before-mentioned Wharton in his * Adenographia

sive glandularum totius corporis descriptio.' Although this author certainly

added to the existing knowledge of the descriptive anatomy of secreting oro'ans,

his views on the functions of glands were strangely fanciful and erroneous'!

The glands he considered to be specially related to the nervous system, the

viscera, so-called, to  the blood-vessels                                                                   such glands  as  the  pancreas, and the sali-
                                                                                                         ;

vary and lachrymal glands being engaged in separating excrementitious substances

from the nervous system. It was in 1665 that the great anatomist Malpighi *

first attempted to investigate the structure of glands in a truly scientific spirit,

endeavouring to establish a relationship between simple glandular' follicles and such

complex glands as the liver. All glands he believed to contain as ultimate elements

bodies which he termed ' acini,' a word which in its primitive classical sense had been

used to designate the stone or seed of the grape or the grape itself. The concep-

tion, indeed, which Malpighi formed of an 'acinus' was rather that of a secretin"-

nodule than of an ultimate saccular or tubular recess. The 'acini,' however, he

believed to be in communication with the eSerent ducts of the glands to which they

belonged, and through which they poured out their proper secretion, derived in the

first instance from the blood contained in minute arteries supplied to the gland.

Ruysch (1606), known as the first celebrated injector of blood-vessels, finding that

frequently the fluids which he forced into the blood-vessels of glands escaped

through their ducts, or made their way into the surrounding tissues, concluded

that the blood-vessels communicated directly with the interior of the "-lands- these

he held to be organs which, according to the views that had long prevailed,

merely strained off from the blood certain of its more liquid constituents. The

views entertained by the most eminent of the supporters of Ruysch, the illustrious

Haller, were expressed by him as follows. After defining the term ' acinus ' to

signify the ultimate division of a gland, he remarfa that ' the acini consist of

congeries of vessels, bound firmly together with a cellular web, containing an

excretory duct in their interior, which commences from the most minute arteries
by small ducts impervious to the blood. ... So that secretion diflers from the

ordinary circulation of the blood in this particular, that the smallest arteries are

continuous with veins of equal or greater size, capable therefore of receiving the

blood, whilst the excretory ducts are much smaller, in order to eflect the separa-

tion of the secretion.' * The advocates of the Ruyschian theory were compelled to
have recourse to the most improbable hypotheses to explain the diversity of the

secretions of different glands, as for example, that different glands secrete difl'erent

liquids, because of the difference in the diameters of the pores by which the blood-

vessels communicate with the glands ; that the different arrangement of blood-

--560 EEPCRT 1882.

 vessels, tlie mode in which they divice, the resistance which they offer to the flow
 of blood through them, by modifying the pressure and velocity of the blood-flow

 through the organ, induce secretions varying in character. It is strange to learn
 from Haller, as was indubitably the fact, that the great majority of his con-

 temporaries, such men as Pej'er and Vieussens, and even Boerhaave, adopted the
 Kuyschian view of the structure of glands. The opposition to Ruysch came first
 from Ferrein,' who maintained that the kidneys essentially consist of an assemblage

--of convoluted tubes, which he looked upon to be the seat of the renal secretion tubes

 which a subsequent investigator, Schumlansky,* looked upon as taking their origin
 in tlie acini of Malpighi, to which he referred the active part in secretion. Then

 followed the researches of Mascagni and Oruickshank, who found, by injecting
 quicksilver into tlie mammary glands, that the ramification of the ducts of this

 organ terminate in racemose follicles ; though ]\Iascagni still admitted a connection,
 by means of open pores, between the sides of tlie glandular blood-vessels and the
interior of the glands themselves. It was unquestionably Professor E. H. Weber,

of Leipzig, who completely demolished the Ruyschian hypothesis, and who by

numerous researches on the salivary glands of birds and of mammals, and on the

 pancreas of birds, established the general fact of the termination of gland-ducts in blind
extremities, though with modesty he put forward his opinions as confirming the
inductions of Malpighi, expressing himself as follows: 'Admirably did Malpighi

 avail himself of the structure of the liver in the lower animals, and the embryo
of the higher, as a foundation-stone for his opinions; for the arrangement of the
 whole glandular system speaks for itself, inasmuch as it simply consists of single,
compact, hollow, blind canals, more or less numerous, floating in the fluid which
surrounds their organs ; and, although these ramifications are drawn out between
the branches of the blood-vessels, there is no immediate passage from one to the

other.'

                           The Reseaeches of Johannes Mullee.

     Such was the state of knowledge in reference to the structure of secreting
glands and secretion at the time when the great Johannes Miiller undertook the
investigation of which the results were first of all published in the memorable work
entitled ' De Glandularum secementiuui Structurii penitiori earumque prima For-
matione.' ^ It is impossible not to sympathise with the reflection of Professor
Heidenhain, recently made in reviewing the researches of Johannes Miiller in con-
nection with this subject ;* to wit, that the physiologists of to-day may be accused
of ingratitude for having allowed the great name of Johannes Miiller to have
well-nityh disappeared from the pages of physiological literature. AVe forget that

--this man this giant in the field of biology as he is appropriately termed by

Heidenhain, the last man of whom perhaps it will ever be said that he was at once

the greatest comparative anatomist of his time, and the most philosophical and

--orio-inal of all contemporary physiological writers by his own researches, and

particularly by the one which concerns us to-day, influenced the progress of phy-

siology, at a most critical period, more than any other man. He was not, like his

contemporaries Magendie and Flourens, a great physiological experimenter, though
he showed that he well appreciated the value of experiment in advancing our

science; but he was pre-eminently a physiologist who recognised the immense

importance of a close study of structure, not only because of the interest which
it presents to the pure and philosophical morphologist, but because of its absolute

necessity, if we are to penetrate at all deeply into the secrets of animal function.

Miiller, "in the first instance, had convinced himself, by the study of the circulation
of organs sufficiently transparent to permit of it, especially the circulation through

the liver of larval salamanders, that, in glands, arteries never end in any other
mode than by capillaries leading into veins. lie set himself then to study in
the case of most glands, and in a large variety of animals, the relationship of

gland-ducts to the truly secreting parts of the orgau, and the relation of the blood-

vessels to these. Basing himself upon these anatomical studies of adult organs,

--and upon a careful study of the development of glands a study which had

been attempted slightly by Malpighi, and more satisfactorily in the case of the

--parotid by E. II. Weber ' Miiller came to the conclusion that all glands possessed

of a duct are only involutions more or less complex of membranes, the largest

number being involutions of the external investment of the body or of the mem-

branes opening upon its surface. The following are the general results relative to

--the structure of glands which Miiller deduced from the anatomical study of indi-

vidual organs : ^

     1. However various the forms of their elementary parts, all secreting glands
without exception (not only those oБ- the human body, but all met with in the
animal kingdom) follow the same law of conformation, and constitute an un-

interrupted series from the simplest follicle to the most complex gland.

    2. No line of demarcation can be drawn between the secreting organs of inver-

tebrata and those of vertebrate animals ; not merelj- do we meet with the simplest

sacs and tubular secreting organs, like those of insects, in the higher animals, but

there is a gradual transition from these simple secreting organs to the glands of the

most perfect vertebrata.

     3. All glands agree in affording bv their interior a large surface for secretion.

--The varieties of internal surface by which the great end extent of surface in a
--small space is attained, are very numerous.

     4. Acini, in the hypothetical sense in which the term has been used by

-- --writers in the sense, viz., of secreting granules do not really exist ; there are no

glomeruli of blood-vessels with ducts arising from them in a mysterious way, as

has been supposed, whatever notions may have been held regarding them.

     5. The parts described as acini are merely masses formed by the agglomeration

of the extremities  of the secreting canals                                                                                                          frequently, indeed, they are  formed  of
                                                                                                                                                  ;

minute vesicles aggregated together in grape-like bunches, which maj' be injected

with mercury, and are often susceptible of iuflation.

    6. In many glands which have been incorrectly described to have acini or

secreting gr.anules, there are not even the hollow vesicular acini; the secreting

tubes, instead of terminating in vesicles or cells, form long convoluted canals or

straight tubuli or short caeca.

     7. It has been demonstrated in the case of all glands that the blood-vessels are

--not continuous with the secreting tubes that the minute vessels bear the same

relation to the coats of the hollow secreting canals, and their closed extremities,

as to any other delicate secreting membrane, such as, for example, the mucous
membrane of pulmonary air-cells.

8. The arborescent ramifications of the blood-%'essels accomp.any the ducts in

their development, and the reticulated capillaries in which the blood-vessels

terminate are extended over all the closed elementary parts of the gland and

supply them with blood. In the chick we may observe the sinuiltaneous de-

velopment of    the two systems                                                                                                       in proportion  as the development of internal
                                                                                                                                   ;

surface from a plain membrane to crecuin and ramified coeca proceeds, the vas-

cular layer of the originally simple membrane is raised on the exterior of the

efflorescence.

    9. The ramified canals and tubes, which when the structure is simple, as in
insects and Crustacea, and even in some glands of the mammalia, lie free and

unconnected, become more aggregated together, and acquire a common covering,

  in proportion as tlieir evolution is carried farther ; and thus is produced a paren-

       10. The capillary hlood-vessels are for the most part much more minute than

   the smallest branches of the ducts of secreting canals and their cpecal extremities,
   even in the most complex glandular organs. The elementary parts of glands, though
  minute, are of such a size that the capillary blood-vessels form around them a net-
   work which invests them.

   evolution from the simple to the complex state as is observed in ascending the
  animal scale. The most perfect and complex glands of the higher animals, when
   they first appear in the embryo of these animals, consist merely of the free efferent
   ducts without any branches, and in that state exactly resemble the secreting
   oi-gans of the lower animals. The glands are formed from the unbranched tubes
  by a kind of efflorescence or ramification.

        12. The mode in which the extent of internal secreting surface of a gland is
   realised is very various ; and no one kind of conformation is peculiar to any kind

   of gland. Perfectly different glands ma}^ have a similar elementary structure, as
   is the case, for instance, with the testes and the cortical substance of the kidneys.

  And similar glands have often a perfectly different structure in different animals

  of which the lachrymal glands, examined in the chelonia, birds, and mammalia,
  afford an example.

       Johannes Miiller recognised thoroughly, as we have seen, that the character of
  a secretion cannot be deduced from the structure of the organ which produces it.

  Was he able to throw any light upon the mystery which had baffled all his pre-

  decessors and to explain the cause of the specific endowments of the different
  glandular organs ? Let us allow Miiller to speak :

        'The peculiarity of secretions does not depend on .the internal conformation of
  the glands; for, as I have sufficiently demonstrated, each 'secretion is in different
  animals the product of the most various glandular structures, and very different
  fluids are secreted by glands of similar organisation. The nature of the secretion
  depends therefore solely on the peculiar vital properties of the organic substance

  which firms the secreting canals, and which may remain the same, however
  different the conformation of the secreting cavities may be ; while it may vary

  extremely although the form of the canal or ducts remains the same.' It was the
  living lining substance of the gland which, according to Johannes Miiller, formed
  the secretion, at the expense of materials which it obtained fiom the blood of con-

  tiguous capillaries. This living substance lining the inner recesses of the glands
  had not yet been differentiated into its constituent units, the secreting cells, and
и therefore Miiller's statement wanted a certain detiniteness, though, so far as he

  went, he was perfectly accurate.

                              The Researches of John Goodsir.

       The success with which that eminent pupil of Johannes Miiller, Theodore
  Schwann, had extended the generalisations of Schleiden (on the part taken by the

  cell in the formation of vegetable structures) to the elucidation of the animal tissues,

 had given the greatest impulse to the stud)' of animal histology, and a large number
 of observers, especially in Germany and England, were directing their attention to
 the discovery and studj^, in all tissues and organs, of the all-important cells.

       Purkinje had announced the hypothesis that the nucleated epithelium which he
 discovered to line the gland-ducts might exercise secreting functions. Henle had
 described with great minuteness the epithelium cells which line the ducts of the
 principal glands and follicles, and which form the most superficial structures of
 mucous membrane, and Schwann had suggested that this epithelium probably
 played a part in the act of secretion. It was, however, unquestionably the Scottish

 anatomist, John Goodsir, to whom was reserved the merit of establishing in an

 indisputable manner the fact that the essential and ultimate secreting structures

 in glands are the morphological units, the gland-cells. As Johannes Miiller had

 examined the arrangements and coarser structure of glands throughout the animal
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 563

Idngdom, with the result of discovering the general plan of gland-structure, and
the analogies existing between glands, however diverse, so John Goodsir passed

under review the histological characters of the cells of diflerent glands in a large

variety of animals, vertebrate and invertebrate. His first results were published in

the 'Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh' for the year 1842 ; his more
matured views were developed in a paper entitled 'On Secreting Structures,' which

formed one of a collection of papers which saw the light in 1845. As a result of
his survey Goodsir came to conclusions of which the most important may be stated,
almost in his own words, as follows :

     ' The ultimate secreting structure is the primitive cell endowed with a peculiar

organic agency, according to the secretion it is destined to produce. I shall hence-

forward name it the primary secreting cell.

    ' Each primary secreting cell is endowed with its own peculiar property, accord-

mammaing to the organ in which it is situated. In the liver it secretes bile, in the

milk, &c,

'The primary secreting cells of some glands have merely to separate, from the

nutritive medium, a greater or less number of matters already existing in it. Other

primary secreting cells are endowed with the more exalted property of elaborating,

from the nutritive medium, matters which do not exist in it.

' The discovery of the secreting agency of the primitive cell does not remove

the principal mystery in which the function has always been involved. One cell

secretes bile, another milk                                                                                                     yet the one cell does not differ more in  structure  from
                                                                                                                             ;

the other, than the lining membrane of the duct of one gland from the lining mem-

brane of the duct of another. The general fact, however, that the primitive cell

is the ultimate secreting structure, is of great value in physiological science, in-

asmuch as it connects secretion with growth, as phenomena regulated by the same

laws.'

Goodsir ^^as unquestionably wrong in certain of his speculations concerning

secreting cells : as, for instance, in attributing at one time the chief part in the

process of secretion to the cell-wall, and at a later period ascribing the same function

to the cell-nucleus. He certainly had not grasped the modern idea, which, as I shall

afterwards mure particularly point out, considers the act of secretion as one of

the results of the activity of the living protoplasm of the cell. His assumption,

too, that the secreting cell invariably contains, preformed, the characteristic matters

of the secretion, is one which is by no means generally true. Nevertlieless, it is

irapo.ssible to study Goodsir's researches on the secreting cell, without ascribing to

him the merit of having been the one who made the most important generalisation,

connecting cell life with a definite organic function.

    I may be permitted, as it were parenthetically, to refer for a moment to John
Goodsir, with the veneration which is natural in one who was his pupil. If it be

true that tlie rapid march of scientific discovery has caused us well-nigh to forget
the great debts which we owe to Johannes Miiller, it is no less true that John
Goodsir's name has passed into premature and undeserved oblivion. Goodsir's was
a mind which in some respects, especially in its tastes, resembled that of Miiller.

He was a devoted anatomist, and studied morphology in the first instance for its own
sake, but also because of the light which it sheds on organic function. He had a power-

ful intellect, an insatiable thirst for knowledge, a sympatliy with all branches of in-
quiry which could throw light upon the science to which he devoted his life, and a
devout and reverential spirit, which was not the less strong because it only rarely

found audible, though then it was emphatic, utterance. In the earlier part of his
scientific career, numerous papers, for the most part short, but cliaracterised by re-
markable originality of observation and freshness of thought, seemed to promise

Athat Goodsir would be one of the most productive of the worlcers of his time.

lingering illness which, without altogetlier disabling him, enfeebled his physical
powers, and cast a gloom upon a life which had promised so much, almost put an
end to his career, in so far as the scientific world at large was concerned, and hence-
forward he devoted his remaining energies to studies of which the results were for
the most part not published, but especially to the task of teaching. Goodsir was
a master who, if judged of by the low standard of fitness to instruct the great

                                                                                                                                oo2

majoritj' of his pupils in such a manner as to enable them successfully to pass

examinations, would occupy no exalted position. He possessed, however, the far rarer

power of instilling into the minds of the best of his pupils that love of original
inquiry, and that deep regard for truth, which are the chief incentives to all
scientific research of any real value.

                    The Iktestigatioxs and TnEORiEs of BowjiAiir.

     At the time when Goodsir was engaged in his investigations and speculations
relating to cells, Mr, Bowman was making researches which were to give him a
lasting place among the great histologists of the century.

     His investigation on the structure of tlie kidney,' which was published in the
'Philosophical Transactions' for the year 1842, surpassed in completeness as au
anatomical study, no less than by the deep insight into the nature of the function
discharged by the organ, any investigation of like kind which had preceded it. It
not only led to a more complete knowledge of the structure of tlie kidney than Wtas
possessed of tliat of any other gland, but to far-seeing generalisations concerning the
structure of mucous membranes, and of secreting organs generally, which found
expression in a masterly article on mucous membranes, published in the year 1847,.
in the ' Cyclopredia of Anatomy and Physiology.'

    Time will not permit of my giving a complete analysis of the (to use a German
expression) epoch-making research upon the kidney ; but let me remind you that it

led to a complete understanding of the relations cf the Malpighian bodies to the
urinary tubules; to a description which, so far as it went, was perfectly accurate of
the tubules themselves, though the scheme upon which these tubes are arranged

--has, since Bowman's time thanks to the labour of Henle, Ludwig, and Sehweigger-
--Seidel been proved to be more complicated than lie had imagined : and to a know-

ledge of the distribution of blood-vessels, not only in the kidney of man and other

mammalia, but also in that of certain reptiles.

     His study of the structure of the tubuli uriniferi had led Mr. Bowman to

discover that in these, a layer of epithelial cells lies upon a structureless membrane,
to which he gave the name of the basement membrane^- and wliich intervenes-
between the epithelium and the blood capillaries, whence the materials of secretion
are primarily derived. His examination of the mucous memlnanes of the body

led Bowman to the conclusion that the relationsliip so easily observed in the case

of the kidney between cells, basement membrane, and blood-vessels is one which

holds true, not only in the case of that orgau, but in that of many other epithe-

liated structures.

     ' In the mucous tissue,' said Mr. Bowman,^ ' there are two strHctures which
require to bo separate!}' described, viz. the basjineiit membrane and the epithelium.
The basement membrane is a simple homogeneous expansion, transparent, colourless,
and of extreme tenuity, situated on its parenchymal surface and giving it shape
and strength. This serves as a foundation ou which the epithelium rests. The
epithelium is a pavement composed of nucleated particles adhering together, and
of various size, form, and number. The following general observations on these ele-
mentary parts will receive illustration as we advance. Neither the one nor the other
 is peculiar to the mucous tissue in the sense either of being invariably present in it,
 or of not being found elsewhere. There are certain situations of the mucous system
 where no basement membrane can be detected, and othei's from which the epithe-

lium is absent. Both, however, are never absent together. Again, a structure

 apparently identical with the basement membrane is met with in numerous textures
 besides the mucous, and all internal cavities, whether serou.s, synovial, or vascular,

(╗r of anomalous kind (as those of the thymus and thyroid body), are lined with
 an epitbeliiiin.'

     As a result of his anatomical studies on the kidney, Mr. Bowman was led to

frame a theory of renal secretion, which, though opposed for a time by a master
mind, has, by the progress of research, received complete confirmation, and which

was based in no small degree upon the new yiews of the function of epithelial
cells in glands. The Malinghian body. Bowman showed, is the dilated commence-
ment of a convoluted tubule, and, like it, presents a delicate, structureless, base-
ment membrane. Into the Malpighian body projects a tuft of capillary vessels,

continuous, on the one hand, with an afferent vessel derived from a branch of the
renal artery, on the other, with an efferent vessel of smaller size than the afferent
both afferent and efferent vessels piercing the capsule of the Malpighian body after

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

leaving the glomerulus, the etFerent vessel breaks up into a series of capillaries, which
are distributed to tlie walls of the convoluted tubes. The tuft of blood-vessels pro-

jecting into the Malpighian body, Bowman described as being perfectly bare, that is

to say, not covered by a basement membrane, or by a layer of epithelium cells.
This part of his description lias not been confirmed by recent work, the more
delicate nu'thf)ds of modern histology allowing of a ready demonstration of a
layer of cells of extreme tenuity coveriiig the glomerulus.

     The basement membrane of the convoluted tube was described as lined by a
nucleated epitlielium of a finely granular opaque aspect; the neck of the tube,
where it joins the Malpighian capsule, and the contiguous portions of the capsule
were described as covered by a layer of cells, differing altogether from the first,
being much more transparent, and possessing in certain animals vibratile cilia. In
some cases the whole interior of the capsule was lined by epithelium cells of great
delicacy and tenuity; in others, these cells could not be traced over more than a
third of the capsule. Basing himself upon the altogether exceptional arrangement

of the blood-vessels of the glomerulus, Bowman advanced the theory that this is a

structure destined to separate from the blood its watery portion. The epithelium

of the convoluted tubes, on the other hand, which Bowman pointed out to be

' eminently allied to the best marked examples of glandular epithelium,' he believed

to be concerned in the separation of the characteristic solid matters of the renal

secretion.

    I shall for the present conclude my remarks upon Mr. Bowman's investigations

and theoretical views by stating that, by his investigations of the blood-supply
to the kidney of the boa constrictor, he gave the strongest proof which could be
derived from anatomical evidence of the correctness of liis views, and furnished
'-,'reat part of the knowledge required for the subsequent researches which Nussbauni
made on the secretion of the newt's kidney, and which afforded the most con-

clusive experimental evidence in favour of the theory which Bowman had

advanced.

                             The Discoveries of Gael Ludavis.

     If to Johannes Miiller we must ascribe the greatest share of merit as a discoverer

of the general affinities, relationships, and functions of glands, it appears unques-
tionable that to C-'arl Ludwig belongs the credit of having, above all others, brought
the light of experimental physiology to bear upon the subject of secretion.

     Ludwig is one of the most eminent of the physiologists who have endeavoured,

so far as possible, to apply the conceptions derived from a study of physical and
chemical processes in general, to the elucidation of the functions of the organism.
More than anyone else has he successfully adapted the methods of research of the
chemist and of the physicist to the investigation of the problems which lay before
him. Above all others he is to be spoken of as the great teacher amongst all of

tlie great teachers of physiology which this century has produced. If we try to

find one who, from the fertility of his mind and the influence which be had upon
men of ability, affected the progress of his science in like measure to Ludwig,

we revert to the name of Liebig. When I say that physiology owes as much to

Ludwig as chemistry to Liebig, I shall, I feel sure, be doing but scant justice to

the great man, wlio at Marburg, at Vienna, and at Leipzig, bas won for himself

the right to be called at once the greatest physiologist, and the greatest teacher of
physiology, of his time.

                                  1. Ludwif/s Discovery of Secreting Nerves.

     It was in the year 1851 that Lndwig first announced to the scientific world '

the fact that the secretion of the salivary glands is under the influence of the

nervous system. C. G. Mitscherlich, as Ludwig points out, had surmised that the

secretion of saliva only occurs as the residt of a stimulation of certain nerves, i.e.

the nerves of taste and the nerves supplying the muscles of mastication. No

attempt had, however, been made, before Ludwig's, to ascertain experimentally
whether the stimulation of nerves supplying glands influenced directly their secre-

tion. As a subject of study Ludwig chose the submaxillary gland. He found

that on stimulating by a succession of induction shocks the nerve-twigs proceeding
from the lingual branch of the fifth nerve, and which accompany Wharton's duct

to the gland, secretion of saliva occurred, so long as the excitability of the nerves
persisted.

     In experiments performed in conjunction with his pupil Rahn, Ludwig found
that secretion occurs on direct .stimulation of the glandular nerves, even when the
circulation has been arrested for a time, as, for instance, when the contractions of
tlie heart are inhibited for some time.

2. Ludwig's Discovery that Secretion is not a Process directly d^iendent upon the
                                                       Arterial Pressure.

In the paper which I have alread}' quoted, Ludwig published the results of the

Afollowing experiments.  mercurial gauge was placed in communication with the

duct of the submaxillary gland, the height of the mercury in the gauge being re-

corded (by means of a float to which was attached a writing point) upon the

travelling surface of the kymographion, the instrument which Ludwig had con-

trived for permanently recording the amount and variations of the blood-pressure in

arteries and veins. At the same time, another gauge placed in communication with

the carotid artery, or one of its branches in close proximity to the gland, recorded

the height of the blood-pressure on the same travelling surface. On stimulating-

the secretory nerves, Ludwig found that saliva was poured out long after the

pressure exerted by it upon the interior of the gland (as measured by the height to

which the mercury was raised in the gland-duct manometer) exceeded the pressure

of blood in the arteries. Thus in his first recorded experiment the mean pressure

of blood in the carotid artery amounted to IOS'5 millimetres of mercury, whilst

during a stimulation of the nerve-filaments going to the gland, the pressure in the

gland-duct manometer rose to between 11)0'7 and 196'5 millimetres, i.e. indicated

that the pressure exerted by the fluid, secreted under the influence of nerve-stimu-

lation, exceeded the arterial pressure by an amount corresponding to a column of

mercury about 3^ inches high. It is obvious that the experiment at once and con-

clusiveW proved that the secretion of a watery liquid like the saliva may be brought

about by a process altogether diflferent from a process of filtration ; for in filtration

the passage of liquid through the minute pores of the filter necessarily depends

iipon a difference in pressure on the two sides of the filter, the movement of liquid

being from the side of greater to that of less pressure.

In this brief sketch I have only time to refer to the most salient of the early

discoveries of Ludwig on secretion, and must pass over without comment tlie first

experiments by which he showed the influence exerted by variations in the strength

of the stimulus of a secretory nerve upon the amoimt and chemical composition of

the secreted liquid.

          3. Ludxcig's Discovery that during Secretion Heat is evolved in Glands.

     Pursuing his researches on the salivary glands, Ludwig some years later,' in
conjunction with his pupil Spiess, discovered that, when a gland is thrown into
action by stimulation of its nerves, heat is evolved. In the case of the submaxillary
gland, for instance, he found that the saliva which was secreted might have a tem-

perature nearly three degrees Fahr. (1'5░ 0.) above that of the blood going to the
gland. Important as was this result, because of the light which it threw upon the
source of animal heat, its value as bearing upon the nature of the process of secre-

tion was even greater. From the fact that the saliva is a liquid containing but
three or four or hve parts of solid matters to one thousand of water, it would scarcely
have been surmised, upon a merely physical hypothesis, that its production would
have been attended by any considerable evolution of heat. The evolution of heat is
indeed one of the strongest proofs we have that the act of secretion is the result

of the living activity of those ultimate units of the glands, the gland-cells ; but to

this I shall revert hereafter.

      The Reseakches op Schipf, Ecehaedt, and Claude Bernaed, ox

                     THE SeCEETOKY NeRYES OF THE SALITAEY GLANDS.

     The study of the innervation of the salivary glands which had been commenced
by Ludwig and Rahn was continued with great success by other observers, and
particularly by Claude Bernard and Eckhardt. The first of these observers proved
the correctness of Schiff's supposition that the abundant secretion which followed
the stimulation of fibres of the fifth cranial nerve was in reality due to the presence
of fibres of the chorda tympani mixed with them. It was Eckhardt, however, and
afterwards Claude Bernard, who established the remarkable fact that, in the case of
the submaxillary gland, and, as has since been shown, of some other glands also, the
gland is under the direct control of two orders of nerve-fibres. The first are con-
tained in branches of cranial nerves, and in the case of the submaxillary gland are
derived from the facial nerve, and, when stimulated, lead to au abundant secretion

of watery saliva, relatively rich in saline and poor in organic constituents; the
second are contained in the" so-called sympathetic nerve-trunks distributed to the

gland ; and these, when stimulated, occasion an exceedingly scanty fiow of very

concentrated and highly viscid saliva, containing a relatively large quantity of
organic constituents, particularly of mucin.

     Claude Bernard now pointed out that stimulation of the above-mentioned

nerves leads to changes in the circulation of blood through the gland, in addition to
the changes in the amount and quality of the tiuid secreted by it.

     Thus stimulation of the cerebral fibres supplying the chorda tympani was
found to produce a great dilatation of the arteries of the gland; so that the amount
of blood passing through it was very largely increased, that passing out through
the venous trunks of the gland presenting a florid arterial colour instead of the
brown venous hue observed when the gland was not secreting. Stimulation of the
sympathetic fibres, on the other hand, caused a great contraction of the glandular
arteries, consequently a diminution of the fiow of blood through the gland and into
the veins, the blood presenting under these circumstances au intensely venous hue.

     The facts just referred to ajjpeared reconcilable at first with tbe view that the
secretion of saliva, as a result of nerve-stimulation, was primarily dependent upon
changes in the circulation of blood through the gland ; though, upon reflection, the
surmise was negatived by some of the facts discovered long before by Ludwig, and
particularly by that, already referred to, of glandular secretion following stimulation
of glandular nerves, even where the circulation has been stopped, as by cardiac

inhibition.

   --Bernard's experiments had unquestionably established that in addition to

nerves which, when stimulated, occasioned the contraction of arteries ' the vaso-

--motor ' or, as we now sometimes call them, the ' vaso-constrictor ' nerves there

are others which when stimulated occasion, on the contrary, the dilatation of

--arteries the so-called ' vaso-inhibitory ' or ' vaso-dilator ' nerves. That it was not

stimulation of the vaso-dilator nerves, which, by increasino: the amount and the
pressure of the blood flowing through the capillaries, occasioned the secretion of
saliva, was shown by several experiments, but especially by an observation of
Keuchel. This observer foimd that the alkaloid of the deadh' nightshade, viz.
atropia,when introduced into the system, exerts such an action, that on stimulating
the chorda tyrapani no secretion of saliva follows ; whilst, on the other hand,
dilatation of the arteries is produced exactly as under normal circumstances.
Other drugs have since been discovered which exert a similar action to that of

atropia in paralysing secretory nerves, whilst some are now known which antago-

nise the action of atropia, and restore the suspended activity of the secretory

nerves. From these studies has unquestionablj' resulted a knowledge of the con-
clusion, that although the process of secretion is favourably influenced by the
vascular dilatation which follows the state of aclivity of the vaso-dilator nerves, the
actual process of secretion is not due to them, but, so far as it is controlled by the
nervous system, is directly under the influence of certain nerves which may be

termed secretory.

Discoveries which show that Seceetion, though influenced by, is not
 NECESSARILY DEPENDENT UrON, STIMULATION OF NeRVES GOING TO A GlAND.

A knowledge of the facts which I have brought before you hitherto would of

itself lead you to suppose that glandular secretion is a process which is in abeyance

except under the influence of stimulation of nerves which throw the gland into

activity, in the same mnnuer as the quiescent muscle passes into activity normally,

only when its motor nerves are stimulated. But this supposition, though it may be'

in some measure true in the case of certain glands, is not borne out by a study of

--secreting glands in general a study which teaches us that whilst the activity of

the gland-cells may be, and often is, remarkably under the control of the nervous

system, it is by no means necessarily dependent upon it. The activity of the

gland depends upon the activity of its individual units, the gland-cells; and these

units may discharge their function so long as they continue to live and are supplied

     Leaving aside, at least for the present, any reference to the arguments which

may be derived, by analogy, from a study of cell life in general, I would call your

attention to the physiological facts which prove the truth of the proposition just

enunciated. The first of these facts was discovered by Claude Bernard: to wit, that
when all the nerves supplying the salivary glands are divided, there is at first a

temporary cessation of secretion, soon followed, however, by an abundant flow of

very watery, so-called paralytic saliva.

This result is fully confirmed by similar observations made in the case of other

secreting organs, and which establish verj' fully the greater or less independence

of the secreting elements from the control of  the  nervous  system                               though  unques-
                                                                                               ;

tionably, in a normal state of the organism of higher animals, the nervous system is

continually intervening, both directly by its influence on gland-cells, and indirectly

by the changes which it produces in the circulation, so as to control the operations

of gland-cells, and especially to bring them into relation with, and subordinate them

to, the work of complex processes of the organism.

    What the exact relations of nerve-fibres to gland-cells may be is yet a matter

involved in great doubt. The discovery made by Pfliiger of the terminations of

nerve-fibres in the secreting cells of the salivary glands has not been confirmed by

any observers in any vertebrate. Kupflfer has, however, unquestionablj^ done so in

the case of Blatta orientalis, and although as yet objective proof is wanting, we

cannot entertain any reasonable doubts that a connection between the ultimate

fibrijlse of nerves and secreting cells actuall}' exists. AVe feel confident that

physical, as it were accidental, difficulties have alone hindered the precise deter-

mination of the fact.

The liiMEDiATE Source of the Nutriment consumed by the
                                G LAND-CELL.

    lu the original scheme of a secreting gland, developed first of all by Bowman,
then adopted by Goodsir, Carpenter,' and many other writers, the essential struc-

--tural elements taken into account were the following: 1. Epithelial cells lining

the secreting cavity of the gland; 2. Sub-epithelial tissue, usually presenting

.superficially the form  of a  basement membrane,  upon  which the  cells  were  placed
                                                                                                                 ;

and .3. a' capillary network in closer relation to the basement membrane, or

more superficial part of the sub-epithelial tissue. In harmonj' with this scheme,

the glandular elements were always spoken of as drawing their supply from the
blood in the capillaries. The one element which was wanting in that scheme, and

which we are able to fit into it, thanks again to the labours of the great physiologist
of Leipzig, is the relation of .so-called lymph-spaces to the other elements. As was

first shown by the researches of Ludwig and his school, amongst the modes of

origin of the peripheral lymphatics, the most numerous are to be foimd in connective
tissue, and nowhere more abundantly than in the connective ti.ssue of glands, which
is everywhere interpenetrated by irregular spaces containing lymph, from whence
spring the minutest lymphatics. If we consider, then, the immediate environment

of the secreting cell, we find that in close proximity to it is the lymph, which is a

transudation from the blood, and upon which the gland-cells are directly dependent

for all the matters which they require. For a certain time, then, the gland-cell
will be independent of the supply of blood, that is, so long as the lymph surround-

ing it contains a sufficient quantity of essential matters, of which oxj'gen is one of

the chief, to support its life, or until it becomes so charged with waste products derived

from cell life, e.g. COo, as to interfere with the functions of the latter. It certainly
appears that, at least in the majority of cases, it is the secreting cell which modifies,
in the first instance, the composition of the lymph which bathes the tissues in
proximity to it, rather than the composition of the lymph which modifies the ac-
tivity of the gland-cell. There are some cases nevertheless in which it would appear

that the presence of certain constituents in the lymph is the direct cause of the

activity or increased activity of the cells.

Secreting Cells peesent dtffeeext Appearances, corresponding- to dif-

 ferent States of Functional Activity. The Researches op Heidenhain.

     Amongst the physiologists of Europe who have most enriched science by their

researches during the last thirty years is imquestionably Professor Heidenhain of

Breslau, who has exhibited his mastery of the physical side of physiology by his
classical research on the relations between the heat evolved in and the work done by

muscle, and as a biologist able to use in the best manner all the resources of modern
histology in the elucidation of bodily function, by the researches to which I wish to
direct your attention for a few moments.

     The glands imbedded in, or the ducts of which open upon the surface of the
mucous membrane of, the alimentary canal, for the most part, are characterised by
periods of more or less complete cessation of activity, as judged by the diminution,
or absolute cessation, of the secretion which they prepare. This is true of the sali-
vary glands and of the liver, but particularly true of the gastric glands and the

pancreas.

     Certain of these glands, i.e. the salivary glands in some animals, and the stomach
and pancreas in all in which they exist, have the task of preparing juices which
contain certain so-called unformed or unorganised ferments or enzymes, upon which
the properties of the secretions in great measure depend. Heidenhain in a long
series of investigations, which have been taken part in by certain other scientific
men, as by Ebstein and Griitzner, by Kuhne and Lea, and particularly 1)y Mr.
Langley of Trinity College, Cambridge, has shown that the secreting cells of a par-
ticular gland, as for instance of the submaxillary gland, of the gastric glands, and

     ' Carpenter, in his admirable article on ' Secretion ' in Todd's Cyclopccdia of Ana-
tomy and Physiology.
--570 REPORT 1882.

of tlie pancreas, exhibit differences in size, differences iu tlie form and appearance
of tlie nucleus, and differences in the cell contents, coiTesponding to varied states of

functional activity.

    Time will not permit my mentioning iu detail the results of these observations

from which, however, certain general conclusions appear derivable. Thus, a gland-
cell at rest is usually larger than a similar cell which has been engaged iu the pro-
cess of secretion ; from its behaviour to reagents, it usually appears to contain
within itself aa abundant store of the body or bodies which are chiefly characteristic
of the secretion, or closely related antecedents of these, and the amount of undif-

ferentiated protoplasm surrounding the nucleus appears to be at a minimum. On

the other hand, the gland-cells, which have been secreting for a greater or less period,
often, though not invariably, present a diminution in their size, a diminution in
the amount of the characteristic bodies previously referred to, and an increase in

the protoplasmic constituents of the cell. All facts, histological as well as physio-
logical, seem to point to the following conclusion : that during rest, the cell forms, at
the expense of, or as the product of the differentiation of, the cell protoplasm, the
bodies characteristic of the secretion ; that whilst secretion is going on these leave
the gland-cell ; and that, at the same time, the protoplasmic constituents of the latter
increase at the expense of the lymph, to be converted secondarily, either at a later
period in that particular act of secretion, or in the succeeding period of inactivity,

into specific constituents. The researches of Ileidenhain have been conducted upon
the glands after these had undergone processes of hardening and staining, the appear-
ances observed indicating changes which, though not identical with, at least corre-
sponded to various conditions of the gland. Kiihne and Lea and Langley have,
however, studied glands in a living condition, and though the appearances were not
identical with those observed by Ileidenhain, they entirely confirm these.

     I have not time to do more than refer to the fact that in some at least, though
probably in all of the cells of glands which produce secretions containing ferments,

there are formed at first bodies to which the generic term of ' zymo<iens' may be

applied, i.e. fermenf-f/enerators, from which a ferment is afterwards set free.

    In coiuiection with this part of my subject I may refer to the view, which was at

one time held by some, that iu secreting glands the gland-cell ihaving produced the
matter of the secretion was thrown off', discharging its contents into the secretion.

This process, when it does occur, must be looked upon as exceptional, and as it were

accidental.

     Amongst the most striking examples of the success with which physiological
experiment and subsequent histological research have been pursued in combination
 so as to throw light upon the functions of particular cells, I may refer first to the
observations of Ileidenhain, secondly to those of Nussbaum on the excretion of
colouring matters, artificially introduced into the blood, by the secreting epithelium
cells of the renal tubules. I have previously refei-red to the theory of Bowman,
according to which the watery and saline constituents of the renal secretion were
supposed to be separated by the so-called ' fflomeruli,' whilst the organic solids
of the secretion were supposed to be separated by the epithelium ILuing the convo-

luted tubes.

     To this theory was opposed that of Ludwig, according to which the whole of
the constituents, watery, saline, and organic, were supposed to be poured out of
the vessels of the glomerulus, the amount of water however being far in excess of
that contained in the liquids when it reaches the pelvis of the kidney. Ludwig

 supposed that as the secretion passed over the surface of the epithelium lining the
 complex tubules, processes of ditt'usion occurred between it, on the one hand, and

the lymph bathing the tissues lying outside of the basement membrane of the
 tubules on the other, the direction of the current of water being from without

inwards. The anatomical evidence adduced by Bowman was of itself well-nigh

 sufficient to prove the accuracy of his views, which have however been placed be-
 yond all dispute by the following observations : Ileidenhain introduced into the
 blood a solution of sulphindigotate of sodium, usually some time after having

divided the spinal cord in the cervical region. On killing the animal some time
 afterwards and subjecting the kidney to careful examination, it was found that the
   TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANATOMY AND rHYSIOLOGY. 571

colouring matter had been accumulated by tlie epithelium of the com-oluted tubules
from the lymph bathing the tissues, and which contained so little colouring matter
as to appear colourless. If a sufficient time had elapsed after the injection, the
colouring matter -was found in the form of granules or minute crystals lying on the
inner side of the cell in the lumen of the tubules.

     Bownum, as I have already mentioned, had in the case of the boa constrictor
studied in detail the blood-supply to the organ, which, as Jacobson had shown,
ditiers in tishes, birds, and reptiles from the mode of arrangement prevailing in
mammals.

     l?owman had shown that in the boa the glomeridi derived their blood exclu-
sively from, the renal artery, and the convoluted tubes exclusively from the common
iliac vein. Nussbaum ga^e absolute completeness to the proof of Bowman's theory
by the following remarkable experiment. Experimenting on the newt, in which
the blood-supply of the kidueyis similar to that of the boa, he found that, when he
tied the renal artery, he arrested almost entirely the secretion of water in the kidney,
but that the excretion of urea and other solid matters, and amongst others of the
colouring matter already used by Heideuhain, viz. indigo carmine, continued.
Ligature of the renal branches of the common iliac vein stopped the secretion of
organic solids without impeding that of water.

Tke most recext Theories .advanced in Explanation of the Phenomena of
                                       Glandular Secretion.

Having brought before you the most salient facts with which we are acquainted,

which appear to throw the most light upon the general physiology of glandular

secretion, I wish, before concluding, to speak of the theoretical views which have

been advanced in explanation of a large number of the facts.

In the first place, I have to confess that our ignorance is absolute as to the

cause (jf the specific endowment of different secretmg cells, in virtue of which they

produce new bodies at the expense of certain of the materials supplied to them by

the lymph, or separate particular constituents from the lymph, to the exclusion of

Weothers which are equally abundant in the liquid.     express the full measure of

our ignorance when we state that the difference in function of different gland-cells

is due to differences in endowment of the protoplasm of the cell, which in no case

is explained by any objective characters of the cell.

The phenomena of the secretion of water, which forms so large a part of every

.secretion, have given rise, however, to numerous speculations, concerning which I

may make a few remarks.

The primitive view that the glands are organs in which is strained oiF from

the 1)1(10(1 water holding certain substances in solution has, in a modified manner,

found tinour with, some even to our own days, and appears indeed, at first sight, to

be borne out by certain facts. Thus within wide limits the amount of water se-

creted by the kidney depends upon the pressure of blood in the glomeruli. Any

circumstances which will lead to an increase of pressure in these vessels (as increase

of blood-pressure generally, division of renal nerves, division of the splanchnics,

especially when combined with stimulation of the spinal cord), by dilating the

branches of the renal artery, will lead to this resvdt. At first this woidd seem

to show that the process of separation of water, in the kidney at least, is but a

process of filtration, though a remembrance of the famous experiment of Ludwig,

referred to at an earlier period, on the relation between the pressure of secretion

of saliva and that of the blood in the arteries, would impose caution in drawing

the conclusion. \\Tiat are the facts, then, relating to the blood-pressure in vessels

in other organs of the body, and the transudation of liquid from them ?

If an increased arterial pressure led ijiso facto to an increased transudation

through the capillary walls, it woidd follow that the amount of lymph and the

pressure of the lymph-stream would rise with the rise of the arterial pressure, but

direct experiments on this matter have led to an opposite conclusion. The experi-

ments of Pa.schutin and Emminghaus, carried out under Ludwig's direction, have

shown that when the arterial pressure in the extremities is increased, there is no
572 EEPORT-- 1882.

corresponding increase in tiie lymph produced. Again, when llie chorda tympani

is stiumlated in an animal into whose blood atropia has been introduced, the ^'as-

cidar dilatation which is produced, and which is tlien unaccompanied by secretion,

does not lead to an increased production of lymph, which would make itself evident

by the gland becoming (Edematous. How then are we to account for the flow of

water through a gland ? By ascribing it to an influence which is exerted by the

gland-cell, in the iirst place, upon the liquid which environs it, viz. the lympli.

And accordingly, even in the case of the glomendi of the kidney, we conclude that

the water is separated as a direct result of the activity of the layer of trans-

jjarent epithelium cells which cover them. Ilering has advanced a strictly physical

theory, which would account for the mode in which certain cells exert this in-

fluence, by supposing that there is produced within them bodies which, like mucin,

have a great affinity for water and which then pass into the secretion ; and which
therefore lead to a current of water passing through the cell ; but the theory is one

Avhicli cannot be admitted, because, as Ileidenhain points out, the passage of water

througli a gland occurs iu cases where there is no constituent in the cells at all

resembling mucin in its affinities or behaviour towards water.

I feel inclined to say that the specidations, necessarily indefinite though they

are, of Professor Ileidenhain aftbrd the best explanation of the phenomena. Heiden-

liain starts from the fundamental fact that during secretion only as much water

passes out of the blood-vessels of the gland as appears in its secretion, seeing that,

however long the process of secretion may continues, the gland never becomes

oedematous, nor does the current of lymph from it increase.

The volume of liquid fllteied through the blood-capiUaries adjusts itself

exactly to the volume of liquiil separated by the cells. This equality in the

.amount of liquid secreted and filtered appears oidy explicable on the supposition

--that the act of secretion is the cause of the current of water in other words, that

the water wliich the cells lose in the formation of the secretion generates changes

in them which can only be compensated for by an abstraction of water from the

immediate enviromnent.

Within certain limits, Ileidenhain continues, we may form purely jihysical

conceptions of the process. AVe may conceive, for instance, the whole protoplasm

of the cell to have a certain affinity for water. The cells at their contact with the

basement membrane may be supposed tti be able to abstract water from it ; the

loss which the membrane sustains will be made up by the lymph, and this again

will influence the blood in the capillaries.

The passage of water into the cells will go on until a period of equilibrium is

attained ; but at that time the current of water from the capillaries through the

Welymph to the cells will cease.  may conceive further, reasons Ileidenhain,

tliat the passage of water out of the cell is hindered Ijy such obstacles to the pro-

cess of filtration as are represented by resistance opposed to it by the superficial

--border layer of protoplasm. If we now conceive that for example, as a result of
--nerve-stimidation the gland-cells pour out water, the condition of equilibrium

which existed between cell, basement membrane, lymph, and capillary will be

disturbed, and a current of liquid set in from the last to the first, and continue as

long as the activity of the cells continues.

It is not difficult moreover, Ileidenhain remarks, to form physical conceptions of

the processes whereby water may be separated from the cell itself. It is conceiA'-
able, for instance, that the protoplasm of the cell may contract after the manner

which occurs in many infusoria, and which in them leads to the accumulation of

water in droplets, forming vacuoles, except that in the case of the secreting cells

the water is poured out on the outside and not on the inside of the cells. Or,

again, it is possible that on the gland-cell passing into the condition of activity an

increased production of GOo may occur, leading to an increased diflusion of water

outwards.

     So far, I have quoted Professor Ileidenhain, for the most part in his own
words. Let me add, however, that the two hypotheses which he advances as

possible explanations of the mechanism of secretion of water by the cell rest upon

the most probable grounds, as upon the presence of the intra-cellular protoplasmic
  --TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANATOMY AND rilYSIOLOGT. 573

network which has been so beautifully demonstrated by recent researches, and
especially by those of Professor Klein ; or, again, upon the fact, proved by tlie

analyses of Professor Pfliiger of the gases of the saliva, that there is diu-ing secre-

tion great production of 00,,. as shown by the amount of this gas in the sali\a
behig much greater than in the blood, and upon the fact of the remarkable diffusibility

of acid solutions.

     Reasoning upon a large number of facts, which I have not time to refer to.
Professor Ileidenhain has come to the conclusion that, quite apart from the nerves
which control the vascular supply to a gland, there exist two distinct sets of nerve-
fibres in relation to the glandular elements. The first of these, which he terms * secre-
tory,' when stimulated, lead to the secretion of water and saline constituents; the
second, which he terms ' trophic,' influence the transformations of the protoplasm
of the cell, and thus attect the organic constituents of the secretion.

     I do not wish to pronounce a definite opinion concerning this hypothesis, but

would remark that the nomenclature proposed by Heidenbain appears to me to be
an unfortunate one, especially because it attaches a new meaning to a word which

had previously been used by physiologists in a different sense. I refer to the

adjective trophic, which has always implied ' governing nutrition.' It appears to me

almost inconceivable that if there exist two sets of secretorv nerves, the action

of each should not profoundly affect the nutrition of the cell protoplasm, though,
of course, it is conceivable that they should do so in very different manners.

                                           General Conclusions.

     The complicated studies, of which I have attempted to give you a brief sketch,
have led to our forming certain clear general conceptions in reference to the process
of secretion. They have brought into greater prominence the dignity, if I may iise
the expression, of the individual cell. The process of secretion appears as the
result of the combined work of a large number of these units. Each, after the
manner of an independent organism, uses oxygen, forms CO.,, evolves beat, and
derives its nutriment from the medium in wliich it lives, and performs chemical
operations of which the results only are imperfectly known to us, and which
depend upon peculiar endowments of the cell protoplasm, of which the causes are
hidden from us. So long as the protoplasm is living, the gland-cell retains its
power of discharging its f\mctions, and in many cases does so, so hjiig as the inter-
cellular liquid furnishes it with the materials required. In some cases, however,

the gland-cells are specially sensitive to a variatiou in the composition of the
nutrient liquid, certain constituents of which appear to stimulate the protoplasm
to increased activity. In the higher animals the cells, particularly in certain

glands, are in relation to nerves which, when stinudated, affect in a remarkable
manner the transformations of their protoplasm, leading to an increased consump-

tion of oxygen, an increased production of carlxmic acid, an increased evolution oT
heat, and an increased production of those matters which the cell eliminates aud
 whicli constitute its secretion.

      This historical survey of the growth of our knowledge of the process of secre-
tion exhibits the characteristic features of biological advancement. Comparative
 anatomy has been the foundation of, observation of facts and physical experiment
the road to, physiological research. At various stages the value of hypotheses has

been well illustrated, and, whenever they have had to make way for the broader

and truer interpretations suggested by the accumulation of facts and greater pre-
 cision of observation, it has been demonstrated that the process of observation is
 not one of simple sight but of comple.x ratiocination.

     The muscles, with the homologies of which this paper deals, are as follows :
     1. Fl-jxor diyitorum Jibtdaris = Flcror hallucis lonr/iis (Human Anat.).
     2. FJp.ior diyitorum tibialis = Flexor diyitorum hmyus (do.).

        3. Tibialis jiosficus.

     The various modifications of tlie.se muscles in many .species of the different orders
of mammalia were described, the leading ones being illustrated by enlarged drawings
of the dissected limbs. E.xaminatiim of a large series of specimens showed that the
three mu.scles are represented by their homologues in most mammals, the Jle.ror
fihilaris existing in all, and exhibiting but few modifications, while the other two
are subject to much variability, and in some instances are severally or collectively
absent. Of these the flcrar tibialis was found to Tary very considerably within

certain limits, a variability hitherto not understood by anatomists, and attempted
to be explained by supposhig the muscle to have undergone fusion witlithe_/?p.iw

secundus, or internus had been given.

      The author showed that the tendon of the flexor tibialis which, in most species
of placental mammals unites in the foot with that of the flexor Jibularis, in many
species (belonging to certain families) of insectivora, edentata, and rodentia, and
 apparently also in all implacental mammals, beeomes .separated from its connection
 with that muscle, and attaches itself in.stead to some part of the tibial margin of tlie

foot, or to the plantar fascia and integument of the sole. An analysis of these two

 leading conditions of the muscle is shown in the table below, and gives interesting
 results, the significance of which was fully discussed.

anus is a terminal-dorsal slit ; the tergum of the last segment (which is prolonged

into the furcal process on either side the anus) is produced into a semicircular plate,
overhanging the anus, Avhichmay hence be termed the 'supra-anal plate.'

                                                                                                       Last nbd. segment.
                                                                                                     Supra anal plate.

                                                                                                    Amis.

                                     -d-vi Furcal processes.

     If this plate is produced further and becomes more or less adnate to the furcal

processes, the anus is pushed down thereby, becoming, tirst, terminal-ventral {e.f;.

phyllosoma larva of Palinurus), and then truly ventral. In the Astaeus, &c., the
furcal processes are visible as lateral truncate setose knobs projecting at the sides of

the telson a little posterior to the anus.

     Embryology also confirms the view taken that the telson of the higher Crustacea
is equivalent to the last ser/mmt of the nauplius bodi/, tot/ether loith an immensehi

developed post-anal portioJi comjioscd in vnryiiif/ prajjoiiions of the supra-anal plate,
and the adnate furcal processes.

     The furcal processes are regarded as outgrowths of this somite, not strictly com-

parable to limbs, but rather to those primitive jyaired outp-owths of the body-segments
ivhich have become limbs elsewhere by the development of basal articulations and a proper
7nusculature, specialisations which are unneeded in this segment attached only at its
anterior end.

     The following Papers were read :

       1. On the Perception of Colour in Man and the Loiver Animals.
                          By J. D. Macdonald, M.D., F.B.S.

2. An improved Method of directly determining the Velocity of the Con-
 iraction-Wave in Curarised Muscle. By Professor E. A. Schafek, F.B.S.

     The method here briefly described is a modification of the one which was
originally employed by Aeby. This, which was not only the first, but still remains
the only direct mode of determining the velocity of the contraction-wave, consists
in resting upon the muscle at a carefully measured distance from one another, two
--576 REroRT 1882.

liglit levers which are made to -write upon the same moving surface ; the muscle is

then stimulated  at  one  end                   the wave of  contraction, in passing  along  the  fibres,
                                             ;

raises the levers in succession, and the space intervening between the commencement

of the curve described by the one lever and that of the other, gives the time taken

by the contraction-wave to traverse the portion of muscle between the levers. From

these data the velocity of the wave is readily calculated.

It is found, however, that the measurements obtained by this method are of

much less value than those deducible from measurements of the rate of conduction of

an excitation along the muscular fibres, or of the rate of passage of the electric

changes which result from stimulation ; indeed, it is scarcely possible to obtain any

exactitude by its means, on account of the difficulty in determining exactly the

points at which the muscle-curves described by the levers begin.

In order to obviate this difficulty I have caused the levers, instead of writing

directly upon a moving surface, successively to break galvanic circuits connected
with a Ruhmkorff induction-apparatus, the ends of the secondary coil being so
arranged that the sparks are transmitted through a sheet of smoked paper, moved

rapidly by means of a strong spring-myograph ; a time-tracing is at the same time
recorded on the paper by a chronograph. The interval between the pricks in the

smoked paper caused by the sparks, gives with great exactness the time occupied by

the contraction-wave in traversing the distance between the levers.

     The (vulcanite ) levers employed for the purpose are about six inches long and of
the third kind. They are so hinged at the fulcrum as to permit no lateral play, and
at a distance of about two inches from the fulcrum a thin piece of steel is rigidly
fixed so as to depend vertically ; the lower end of this rests on the muscle.

     Each lever carries at its free end a small semicircular bridge of copper wire, the

ends of which are bent downwards ; one end terminates in a platinum point, and the
other end is amalgamated. Immediately beneath the platinum point is a plate of

the same metal, capable of being raised up by means of a screw, so as to be brought

in contact with the point ; and beneath the amalgamated point is a small cup
containing mercury, the surface of which can also be raised by a screw (as in the

Helmholtz ' double-contact ' arrangement emploj-ed in the ' Frosch-unterbrecher
of du Bois-Reymond), so as to touch the amalgamated point, and by subsequently

depressing the mercurial surface, remain connected with it by a thread of mercury

only. J5y this contrivance any current which may be passing through tlie wire

from the platinum plate to the mercurial cup, or vice versd, is broken at the point

of contact with the plate tlie instant the lever is raised, but in consequence of the

breaking of the mercurial thread, the circuit is not closed again when the lever falls,

until the mercurial surface is again raised by the screw.
     In experimenting with this apparatus especial attention must be directed to the

regulation of the contact between the platinum point and plate, the latter being
screwed up with the greatest possible care, so as ouly just to make contact with

the point.

The results which I have obtained by this method, although not yet sufficiently

numerous for detailed publication, have given a considerably higher velocity (between

2 and 3 m. per sec.) than those yielded by the original metliod of Aeb}'.

   A modification of the above method consists in the adoption of Pouillet's

method of time-measurement. The arrangements for this purpose are simpler, the
spring-myograph and the RuhmkorfT being dis]iensed with and their place taken

by a galvanometer. The second copper bridge, i.e. the one attached to the further

lever, is introduced directly into the galvanometer-battery circuit (by connecting
the wires of this circuit with its platinum plate and mercurial cup), but the first

copper bridge is so connected laterally as to short-circuit the current. The raising
of the first bridge, therefore, sends the current through the galvanometer, and the
raising of the second bridge breaks the circuit. During the interval between the
raising of the levers the current has been acting upon the galvanometer, and tht>

length of time it has been passing can be ascertained by noting the extent of

deflection of the galvanometer-needle.

             3. Note on tlie Structure of the Muscular Tissue of the Leech.

                               By T. W.' Shore, Jan., B.Sc.

      After detailinfj his observations on the fresh muscle-tissue of the leech, and
describing the action of reagents, the author sums up as follows:

      1. The muscle- tissue of the leech consists of elongated tubes with two coats

--the sarcolemma and contractile layer the inner surface of which is irregular, and

gives rise to apparently granular contents.
       2. In the living condition it is uustriped.
      3. There are no nuclei, and the contents are a colourless serous fluid.

     4. Transverse striation may be produced post mortem as the result of three sets

of changes :
            (rt) Regular arrangement of the papillte on the inner surface of the con-

                             ti'acttle layer.

            (6) Foldings of the surface of the sarcolemma.
            (r) Splitting into segments of the contractile substance.

     5. The contractile substance coagulates, forming myosin, which subsequently

contracts.

     6. The rapidity of and mode of contraction give rise to varying appearances of

fissures, striation, &c.

    He then passes on to a discussion of the bearing of these results on other con-

siderations, and finally suggests a new theory as to the structure of striated muscle-

tissue.

           4. On the Kidneys of Teleostei. By W. Newton Parker.

     In a paper read last year at the British Association, the late much-lamented
Professor Balfour showed that in certain adult Teleostei, as well as in Lepidosteus
and Acipenser amongst the Ganoids, the so-called 'head-kidney,' or pronephros,
contained no uriniferous tubules, but was composed entirely of highly vascular

lymphatic tissue. He therefore considered it probable that there were no func-

tionally active remains of the pronephros in the adults of either of these groups.

     The author of the present paper, in following up these investigations, finds that
in some Teleostei the so-called ' head-kidney ' has precisely the same structure as

the rest of the kidney, or mesonephros. He nevertheless holds to Balfour's view

as to there being no functionally active remains of the pronephros in the adult, and
explains the above cases by siipposing that the mesonephros has grown forwards in
i'ront of the air-bladder, where there is most room for it, so as to take the place of
the larval pronephros. That this is not improbable is shown by the gi'eat variation
in the form and position of the mesonephros in difterent species of fishes.

          5. On the -presence of a ' Tympanmn ' in the genus Raia.
[ By George Bond Howes.

     The author regards a fenestra (long known to exist) in the roof of the audi-
tory capsule of the genus, and its adjacent parts, to be a modification of what is
seen in other species, which is correlative of the compression from above downwards
undergone by it, resulting in the formation of a 'tympanum' physiologically fore-

shadowing the essential process involved in the elaboration of the auditory organ
of the higher forms, the real bearing of which has hitherto escaped notice.

a blue reaction being produced by the administration of hydrocyanic acid, and

suggested the possibility that there may he a quasi-spoutaneous formation of some

' cyanoid ' poison in the blood.

     The following Papers were read :

     1. Considerations arising from Kocli's Discovery of the Bacillus of

                       Tuberculosis. By F. J. Faraday, F.L.S.

    Two great discoveries, Pasteur's discovery of the decreasing virulence of specific

disease-germs when kept in the presence of oxygen, and Koch's discovery of the
bacillus of tuberculosis, have been made within the past two years. The author

suggests a possibly useful relation between these discoveries. Referring to the
suggestion of Dr. William Roberts, F.R.S., of Manchester, in his address to thfe

Medical Association in 1877, that disease germs may be 'sports' from _ harmless

saprophytes which have acquired a parasitic habit, he asks whether deprivation of
oxygen, or cultivation in gaseous mixtures from which the normal supply of free

oxvgen present in good air is absent, may not liave an influence in converting harm-
less ferms present in the atmosphere into the l)acilli of tuberculosis. He refers to

Carl Semper's researches on the influence of the environment on animal modiflcation,

and to the fact that many larvaj of insects live in situations where tlie air is un-

doubtedly mixed with gases which tlie higher vertebrata could not breathe without
injury, and suggests that the adaptability of organisms, and their impressionability

by surrounding conditions, may increase as the scale of life is descended. He also

refers to a paper by Mr. Frank Hatton, F.C.S., read before the Chemical Society,
on experiments with bacteria in various gases. Mr. Hatton gave the chemical

results, but it would be interesting to know the influence of cultivation in
such media on tlie character of the bacteria themselves. Dr. Angus Smith has
argued that the putrefying process, when carried on in confined places, such as
sewers, may develope disease-germs which are not developed when the same

process goes on in unconfined places ; typhoid fever seems to be developed by pro-
cesses in sewers which, carried on in the Clyde for instance, do not originate any

well-marked disease. Analogous conditions may be presented in the lungs of

persons engaged in dusty trades, breathing vitiated atmosphere in ill-ventilated
rooms, or engaged in sedentary occupations, and not taking healthy exercise;

and also in the lungs of persons who are hereditarily narrow-chested, weakly,

and of feeble inspiratory habit. Innoxious germs present in the atmosphere

may be inhaled and retained in the lungs of such persons, and there by suc-

cessive culture and deficient aeration acquire a parasitic or deadly character.
The author refers to Pasteur's method of restoring the virulence of ' atte-
nuated ' germs by successive culture in the bodies of different animals, as possibly
 explaining the communication of tuberculosis to persons of sound constitution, the
 parasitic habit of the tubercle ' sport ' being so strengthened and confirmed by suc-
 cessive culture under the assumed favourable conditions, as to enable it eventually
 to establish itself under certain conditions in a milieu, which would not be suitable

for the origination of tlie culture. He refers to a new treatise by Dr. Ferdinand

 Kroczak, of Brlinn, entitled ' Die Heilung der Tuberculose,' and shows that Dr.
 Kroczak's arguments in support of the special treatment recommended by him

 are in harmony with the hypothesis advanced.
      The decrease of mortality from consumption in the army since the improvement

 of barrack ventilation, and the relief afforded to patients by sea voyages, the air of
   TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 579

pine-woods, carbolic-acid inhalations, and by other suggested remedies, is also re-
ferred to as giving support to the hypothesis.

   2. BemarJcs on Filaria Sangiiinis Mominis. By Dr. Cobbold, F.B.S.

     The author gave a full account of the relations subsisting between
the larval microscopic filariaj occurring in man, the higher larval stages of the
same parasite occurring within the body of the mosquito, and the sexually mature
form, or Filaria Bancrofti. The development of the parasite, as made known by
the researches of Manson, were carefully described, and the phenomena of filarial
periodicity were explained by means of a series of large diagrams. The author

maintained, contrary to the views generally held, that the bloodsucking propen-
sities of the mosquito had more to do with the heating of the ova of the insect

itself than with any immediate purpose of self-nourishment. The provision for
tlie welfare of the filarise and their reproduction was thus, in a truly remarkable
manner, intimately bound up with the welfare of the insect. In the course of the
paper the author specially referred, not only to the brilliant results obtained by
MansoD, but also to the discoveries of Drs. Lewis, Myers, and Stephen Mackenzie.

3. On the Destiny of the Filaria in the Blood. By Dr. P. Manson.

In this paper (communicated by Dr. Cobbold), the author dealt with the ques-

tion of the fate of the embryo parasites which have not been directly removed from

--the circulation by mosquitoes. lie asks : ' Do they, after a brief life of a few

Andhours, die ? '  again : ' Do they daily retire to some oi'gan, or set of vessels, to

await the recurrence of conditions that induce them to return to the circulation?

Dr. Manson had kept the larvte alive in the serum of blood for more than 100

hours. Dr. Myers has expressed an opinion that there is a daily dissolution of the

filariae, but Dr. Manson combats this view, and from his observations is led to

conclude that it is unreasonable to suppose that ' animalcules exhibiting such tena-

city of life outside the body should so. quickly die within it.' As bearing upon this

subject he also remarks : ' I do not recollect ever to have seen in freshly drawn

blood a dead filaria, at least one parasite whose death could not be easily accounted

for by accidental crushing under the glass cover.' и

                                    (Vice-President of the Section).

                    THURSDAY, AUGUST 24.

                             Tlie Department did not meet.

                             FRIDAY, AUGUST 25.

The Chairman delivered the following Address:

Although the President of this Section has made eloquent allusion to the great

loss which the whole scientific world has sustained in the death of our great

countryman, Charles Darwin, still I am sure I shall not he thought to he doing

more than is my bounden duty if I, too, from this chair gi^e some utterance to

the deep sense of irretrievable loss wliich all we in tliis department must feel has

fallen npon us.

    It is not my Intention to give an account of Mr. Darwin's numerous works, for

that has already been partially done by abler hands than mine, and a complete
survey of his labours woidd occupy much more time than that which is usually
allotted to an address such as this. At the same time I think that in this depart-

ment we are particidarly called upon to give utterance to some expression of our
feelings, inasmuch as we may be said to ha^'e been more concerned in those matters

(jf which Mr. Darwin was teacher than any other section of the Association. It

was upon this platform, more than in any other place, that the great battle of the
doctrine of evolution, which is so intimately connected with Mr. Darwin's name,

--was fought. It was upon this platform that his friends and coadjutors Mr.

Alfred Wallace, Sir Joseph Hooker, Professor Huxley, and many others-- ex-
pounded his ^iews, and added by their own researches to the siun of evidence

which has finally convinced all the leading scientists of the day of the substantial

sovuidness of his speculations.

    There are many of us now present who will never forget the intense interest

and excitement which attended the discussions wliich took place in the earlier

days of the  history of the  doctrine of evolution                                                                                                    nor shall we  forget  with  what
                                                                                                                                                   ;

bitterness Mr. Darwin's views were met, on the occasion of the Association's meet-

ings at Oxford, Cambridge, Norwich, and Exeter: nor how everything that came

from his pen was regarded with feelings of suspicion and hatred ; and how even his

blameless and guileless character was frequently assailed by those who could only

see in his works a desire to dethrone all that which they considered sacred. It is

also in the recollection of all of us here how he met tlie attacks Avhich were made

upon him with silence, never returning opprobrious declamation or insulting sarcasm

by angry or contemptuous answers. Ever conscious that his aim was to search out

the truth and that only, he could afford to disregard contumely and misrepresenta-
tion. Indeed, so completely was he imbued by the consciousness that his aim was

righteous, that the taunts and sneers which were lavished upon him seem to have

been powerless even to vex him. Again, we in this department will remember how
these attacks year by year grew less frequent and less bitter : how wholesale
denunciation gave place to legitimate questionings of particular points, and how

even personalities at last gave place to general professions of esteem and respect

till at last, but a few short months ago, we witnessed the burial of his remains in
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.-- DEPT. ZOOLOGY AND BOTANY. 581

the national mausoleum, and saw bis coffin followed not only by scientists and lay-

men, but by priests of various religious denominations, all of whom sought by the'ir

presence to testify to their recognition of his great worth ; and perhaps some to

atone in a measure for the imjust things which they might have said or thought

about him, when they were unacquainted with his character, and only half-

acquainted with the object and nature of his labours.

     But although our hearts are still sore at the remembranci of our loss, tliere are

many things the reflecting upon which may weU console and reconcile us to it.

In the first place he had been spared to us till such a time as we were able to

Avalk without further    needing  the  assistance  of his guiding                                       hand                        and  the  work
                                                                                                                                 ;

which had occupied him all his life had been so far finished that it can now without

difficulty be carried on by his disciples.

      In the next place, his life, although far from having been free from suffering,

had been prolonged to a green old age, and he was able and delighting to work
almost to the very day of his death. lie had the satisfaction of looking back upon

a long life happily and worthily spent. He had the satisfaction of living to see

the doctrines which he had promulgated gradually acknowledged, and finally uni-

versally accepted. He was surrounded by devoted friends, and regarded by all

naturalists with a reverence and affection such as has fallen to the lot of none since

the time of Linnaeus.

    If, however, we have consolation in the remembrance that the lamp of Charles
Danvin, which had burned so In-ightly, had also burned its full time, we have none

such in the case of that other bright light, which has lately been so unexpectedly

extinguished. In the lamentable death of Francis Balfour, at' the early age of thirty,

we can only feel unmixed regret.

He had already done great things, and we had a right to hope that he would

have lived to achieve greater things still.

He had just been appointed to a professorship in Cambridge, where everyone

confidently looked forward to his doing in that University for morphology what his

master and  friend  had  done  before  him   in  physiology                                             to his inspiring his pupils
                                                                                                     ;

with a true love of his branch of science, and making them, like himself, original

observers and workers. Everyone, too, made no doubt but that he would further

follow out those elaljorate researches in the development of the early stages of

growth in animals, which had already made his name known and honoured

wherever in the world the subject of animal morphology is studied.

But all these hopes have been cruelly destroyed by that fatal accident which

occurred to him while travelling in search of recreation and health on the Alps

of Savoy. W^ithout impiously wishing too closely to scrutinise the decrees of

heaven, we cannot help asking why he, who could be so badly spared, should have

been taken, while the thousands, who woidd not have been so much missed,
and who every year risk somethnig in climbing the Alps, should yet escape

without injury.

     It is now eight years since Mr. Bentham communicated to this department, at
Belfast, his report 'On the Recent Progress and Present State of Systematic

Botany,' and I propose to take for the subject of my address to-day the advances

which have been made in this branch of botany since that date.

     _Mr. Bentham, for the more easy consideration of the subject, classified the

various works relating to systematic botany under six heads. And I do not think

I can adopt a more convenient plan than to follow upon the same lines.
     The six heads were as follows :

      1. Oi-dines Plantarum. Being general treatises on descriptive reviews of the
natural orders.

     2. Genera Plantarum. Being the methodical enumeration and descriptions of

genera.

     и3. Species Plantarum. Being the methodical enumeration and descriptions of

species.

4. Monographs of separate orders or genera, sub-genera, or species.

5. Floras of separate coimtries or districts.

6. Detached and miscellaneous specific descriptions.
--582 EEPOET 1882.

                                                 1. Ordines Plantarum.

     Under this head I have no work of importance to bring before your notice.
     Indeed it is not to be expected that worts of this kind shoiild appear at more
than very rare intervals ; for not only do general treatises on the relationships of

natiu-al orders require for their successful treatment an intimate acquaintance with
veo-etable moi-phology, both gross and minute, but there must also be a special
acquaintance with the life-history of a large nxmiber of individual species belonging
to each order. And, moreover, this very extended knowledge (which is possessed
by few botanists) must be accompanied by an acutely logical mind and great
soundness of judgment.

                                                 2. Genera Plantarum.

     For the same reason that works descriptive of the orders of plants appear but
rarelj', so are works descriptive of the genera of plants few and far between.
Indeed, where there is an attempt to describe all the genera belonging to the
Phanerognmia, such works are less frequent ; inasmuch as the mechanical labour
of dissecting the innumerable number of species of which the genera are composed,
 and of writing out a description of them, is infinitely greater.

      I have, however, tlie great satisfaction of being able to record the near comple-

tion of that monument of original research and industry, ' The Genera Plantarum,'
 by Mr. Bentham and Sir Joseph Hooker. This work, the publication of which
 has extended over a period of exactly twenty years, consists of three large octavo
 volumes, each of which contains over one thousand pages of closely printed matter.
 In these pages are described the genera belonging to the angiosperms and
 gvmnosperms, amounting in all to the enormous number of something like 7,400.
 Simply to compile from works so large a number of genera would entail an
 immense amount of labour. But when we know that each genus has been critically
 investigated by one or other of the authors, not only as regards the characters, which
 were to determine its limits and explain its affinities with other genera, but also as
 regards its synonymy, which, in many instances, had become fearfully involved

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

 and when we add to tlsis the Icnowledge that the geographical distribution of each
 genus has been carefully worked out, we can only maiwel that so much should have

 been done so quickly.

     No doubt, as time goes on, and new plants are discovered, and more complete

  information is gained respecting old ones, it will be found necessary to revise the

 characters and limits of some of the genera. And when all is done, there will be
 diti'erences of opinion in many cases as to where the limits may be most conveniently

  placed. Nevertheless, there can be little I'oom for not believing that , in by far the
  greater number of instances, the genera as here defined will be accepted as fixed so
  long as our present nomenclature exists.

                                                    3. Species Plantarum.

       Under this head again, so far as the Phanerogamia are concerned, there is
  nothing new to report. Nor do I think there is any likelihood that any general
  work, including all the species which are known, will be forthcoming for many
  years. Indeed, I do not feel sure that it wovdd be desirable at present that any

  one should attempt such a work. And for the following reason.
       "Within the last few years, many parts of the world, which were foi-merly un-

  known or closed to us, are begiiming to be thrown open to our collectors ; and we
  have had already a large number of new species sent home. But in many of these

   parts, our collectors have reaUy been able to do little more than snatch at the flora,

  as they have hurried through on some rapid journey. Hence we may fairly expect
  that for many years to come there will be more new species constantly turning up.
  This being so, I think it might be better that we should wait a little longer till
   the list of known plants approaches nearer completion.

        Meanwhile, there is a great deal of needful preparatory work, which is being
   done ; such as the carefully comparing every new species with those already Imown,
--TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ZOOLOGY AND BOTANT. 583

and more particularly still, the unravelling- that dreadful synonymy which clogs and

fetters the systematist at every step.

     Anion<rst the cryptogamia, I have to make mention of the completion of Jaeger's

* Adumbratio Florte Muscorum.' This work was begun in the year 1871 and carried
on by Dr. Jieger until his death, when alter a short interval it was recommenced
and iinally iinished by Dr. Sauerbeck two years ago. With its two supplements, the
' Adumbratio' enumerates 335 genera and 7,-i22 species, and gives, so far as it is
known, the geographical range of each species over the world. There are, however,
no descriptions of the species, but the muscologist is referred to the various pub-

-- --lications in which these at least tlie more recently described ones have originally

iippeared. The synonymy, which in mosses is as extensive and as confused as in
any other group of plants (always excepting the ferns), is in many cases imper-
fectly worked out ; and the dithculty of finding a species or its synonym is further

enhanced by there being no index. But notwithstanding these defects, the last
of which might easily be remedied, the work is one of considerable value to those

who have to arrange in an herbarium large collections of mosses, and it will save
anyone, who may hereafter undertake the task of writing a ' Species Muscorum,'

-- --a vast amount of preliminary labour. AVhetber the numberof genera and species
    and especially the genera have been undidy increased by overdividiug is a
subject on which there will be considerable difference of opinion ; but as a matter

of convenience the' system of having big genera, with sections, is much to be pre-

ferred to that of having a number of small ones ; if only on account of the great
 multiplication of names which the latter entails. In the case of species, the

Idnd of names, which have been given of late, are suggestive of sub-division

having been carried too far. For instance, we have many so-called species the
names of which are made up of some old well-known species and the prefix
* pseuflo' or ' sub.'' Thus in the genus Hypnum we have no less than twenty-seven
names beginning with ' jjse'tdo,' as Hypnum j^seuclo-commutaium, Hypnum ]3seudo-
popxdeum, or Hyimum jiseudo-veluthmm ; while in the same genus under 'siФ6,' such
for instance as Hypnmn suh-imjjonenx or Hypnum sub-rutahulum, we have no less

 than forty-nine such names.

           4. Monographs of separate o'-ders, or genera, sub-genei-a, or species.

     There are several important monographs, which have been written during the
last few years; and perhaps none more so than those which have made their
appearance under the auspices of the two De Candolles (father and son), in con-
tinuation or revision of the ' Prodromus.' In the three volumes as yet published
there are ten orders, which have been monographed. The orders are

Smilacese      by Alphonse De Candolle.

Restiacepe     by Dr. Masters.

jNIeliacese    by Casimir De Candolle.

AraceiB        by Engler.

Phylydraceae by C-aruel.

Alismaceae )
Butomese 'r by Michel.

Juncaginere I

Commelinacere by C. B. Clarke.

Cucurbitacere by Cogniaux.

      It will be noticed that of these ten orders eight belong to the monocotyledons.
This will be welcomed l)y all botanists, as it is this portion of the phanerogamia
which has been most neglected.

     Another of the monocotyledonous orders, which has been worked out at great

length by Von Otto Boeckler'in 'Lhnifea,' is Cyperacese. But as his writings extend
over no less than seven volumes of that journal, it is an awkward work to use, let

alone that his arrangement and limitation of the species is not always easy to

imderstand.

     In Graminepe, botanj' has received a great blow in the unfortunate death of

General Mumo, who, had life been spared to him for a few years longer, would doubt-
--584
                                                                                   REPORT 1882.

less have given to the world one of the most satisfactory accounts of that large and

difficult order which has ever appeared. But now, unfortunately, all idea of

speedily seeing a monograph of the species of Gramineaj must be given up, although,

as far as the genera go, we shall soon have Munro's labours presented to us by Mr.

Bentham, together with his own, in the forthcoming part of the ' Genera Plantarum/

Mr. Baker still continues his researches on the Liliacere and Iridacese, publishing-

from time to time monographs of the species of various genera belonging to those

orders. Both of these orders present many difficulties in the way of those who

attempt to arrange and describe the species, partly on account of the general suc-

culency of the plants, and partly because many of tlie more important characters

are to be found only in those portions of the plant which frequently grow under

ground ; such as the coru of crocus, or the rhizome of iris, and which are often

absent from herbarium specimens. And, again, owing to the beauty of their

flowers, thej^ have always been great favourites with liorticulturists, who have split

up the species and multiplied the names to an inordinate extent.

The largest order among the monocotyledons (the grasses not excepted, accord-

ing to Mr. Bentham) is orchidacere, the species of which are still being carefully

described  and                                                            figured  chiefly by Professor  Reichenbach                                                              but in so     many difl'erent
                                                                                                                                                                               ;

places that, to a great extent, his most valuable labours are not rendered as

Aavailable as they ought to be.                                                    single work combining all Professor Reichenbach's

own researches with those of others, and forming a sort of second ' Gener^ et

Species Orchidearum,' would leave nothing further for the botanist to desire.

One other monograph which I must mention is that of' ( 'yrtandreae,' by Mr. C.

B. Clarke. Tliis, wliich is nearly ready for the press, will include a description of

the characters and geographical distribution of all tlie species of that most difficult

and hitherto l^ut little known order.

                                                                          5. Floras of separcite countries or districts.

It is under this head that we have had the greatest amount of activity shown.

The conditions, which at present obtain, are particularly favourable for the

compilation of floras, when compared with what they were twenty or thirty years

ago. In those days working botanists were few : now there are manj' enthusiastic
and excellent ones resident in all parts of the world, and who are not only able

but willing and eager to assist in any undertaking which may tend to perfect our

knowledge of the plants of their particular country. Consequently, not onlj- is

the material which is sent home much greater than it used to be, but it is accom-

panied by valuable information, such as could be given only by experts living in

the districts where the plants grew.

I proceed now to enumerate the more important floras which have either made

their appearance or have been completed Avithin the last eight years.

1. First and foremost I have to make mention of those floras, which are being

published under the authority of our colonial                                                            Governments                                                                  and  among  these  there
                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

stands out most prominently of all ' The Flora Australiensis ' by Mr. Bentham,

assisted by Baron Ferdinand "\'on Mueller of Melbourne. This work, tlie first

volume of which was issued in the year 1863, was completed with the publication

of the seventh and last volume in 1878. These seven volumes describe all the species

of Phanerogams and Vascular Cryptogams, which are known to grow in Australia

and Tasmania. The description of the species is sufficiently detailed without bemg

cumbersomely long, and the affinities of any, when doubtful, are always com-

mented upon                                                               and useful suggestions made for  their more                                                                 accurate  determination,,
                                                                       ;

by those who may hereafter have better opportunity for their study.

The information respecting the distribution of each species is also very full.

For the sake of convenience the country has been divided into areas, corresponding

to the territories of the different colonies, viz. Queensland, New South Wales,

Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, and West Australia ; and as a species is
known to grow in one or more of these areas so it is indicated ; and not only this,

but mentiou is also made of the particular place or places in the colony in which it

has been found. So that while we have a flora which describes all the plants of
     --TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION 1>. DEFT. ZOOLOGY AND BOTANY. 585

 this immense island, the colonists have, for all practical purposes, no less than six
 local Horas. A^^ain, in addition to this, when the species is not confined to
  Australia, its distribution over other parts of the workl is given.

       2. Next in importance to the ' Flora Australiensis,' and wliatwhen finished will
 be of even greater magnitude, comes the * Flora of Britisli India ' by Sir Joseph
 HoojБer. This work was begun in the year 1872, ajid was continued witli the

 --assistance of various botanists to the end of jMyrtacete. Since then and the

--world will have no reason to complain of the change it has been carried on by Sir

 Joseph Hooker and Mr. O. B. Clarke alone. It has now reached to the com-
 mencement of Vaccinieie, and more parts may be shortly e.xpected, which will

 carry the work forward to the end of Monopetalte.
      The 'Flora of British India' takes in the whole of that country which lies

 between the southern slopes of the Himalayas and Ceylon. Besides this it includes
 the British portion of the Malayan peninsida, and the islands which lie between
 that country and India jjroper. Thus it will form the connecting link between
 Western Asia on the one hand, which is being described by jM. Boisseau in his
 ' Flora Orientalis,' and on the other with the floras of Sumatra and Java, which
 have been so carefully elaborated by Blume, Miquel, and others.

      Many portions of the vast tract covered by these and other authors, such as
 Borneo and New Guinea, can hardly yet be said to have been properly explored,
 and therefore, many new genera and specie.* maybe yet expected to occur ; still

 it is not likely that the additions will comprise more than a small proportion of
 what is already known.

     It is computed that when the ' Flora of British Indi.i ' is completed, it will contain
descriptions of some twelve to fourteen thousand species of phanerogams and ferns.

      In some re.spects the dithcidties attending the elaboration of the Indian flora
 are greater than in the case of any other countrj'. In the first place, the climate of
 a large portion of the land is so humid, that the satisfactory preservation of speci-
mens by drying is almost impossible. The consequence of this has been that a great
 deal of the material, placed at the disposal of authors, has often been very de-
fective. In the second place, the hterarv difficulties are unusually great ; for India,

through having been so long known to Europeans, has been more or less explored
by botanists, who for the last hundred and fifty years have been writing with very
commendable diligence, but varying ability, descriptions of all the plants they met

with. These writings are very numerous, and by themselves form a library of no
small dimensions. But all have to be searched out, and their contents, often very

 misleadhio-, carefully digested.

     3. In Mr. J. G. Baker's 'Flora of the Mauritius and the Seychelles' we have
another of the colonial floras of much worth and exactness ; and one which, with

Professor B. Balfour's researches into the vegetation of the island of Socotra, helps
to bridge over the gap between the South Asiatic and Eastern African floras. Frora

Mr. Baker's pen we may hope to liave also before long a Flora of Madagascar.

     4. The ' Flora of Tropical Africa,' by Professor Oliver, was begun in the year
1808, and continued, with the assistance of other botanists, to the end of the third
volume, which was published in 1877, by which the work has been brought down
to the end of ' Ehenacese.' Since then for various causes it has been at a standstill.
But we may be permitted to hope that ere long it will again be resinned ; for the
collection into one book of all the species which are known to grow within the
tropics of Africa would be extremely convenient, as the number of writers on
African botany, if not as great as those on India, is still sufficientlj- great to make

the identification of specimens a matter of very considerable labour. No doubt,
when finished, the ' Flora of Tropical Africa ' will not approach to anything like the

completeness of the other floras which I have mentioned, for of all parts of the
world Central Africa has up to the last few years been hidden in obscurity, and the
number of .species, wliich were known when the first volume was issued, probably
did not exceed the number of those which had still to be discovered.

    5. I may mention the ' Flora Oapensis,' by the late Dr. Harvey and Dr. Sonder

(although it neither was begun nor has been continued dm-ing the last eight years),
if only to point out that if completed the flora of the whole of Africa south of the
586 EEPOKT-- 1882.

tropics would then have been described. At present it has been carried as far as

Canipamilaeeffi.

    Turnin<^ from our colonial floras, we have a work of very great importance, to

which I have already made allusion ; I mean the 'Flora Orientalis,' by M. Edmond
Boissier. Since 1874 two more volumes (viz. the third and fourth) have made their
appearance, bringing the description of the species down to the end of ' Apetalse.'

This work, roughly speaking, includes all that tract of land which lies between the

northern tropic and the forty-fiftli parallel, and between the twentieth and seventieth

--degrees of longitude. It takes in the following countries: Greece, Turkey, Upper

Egypt, Northern Arabia, Sj'ria, Asia Minor, Caucasia, Persia, Afghanistan, Belooch-

istan, and the greater portion of Turkestan ; and, as I have pointed out before, its
1)0undaries on the east are in the greater portion of their extent identical with the

westein boundaries of the Flora of British India.

(3. Coming to Europe we have had a most valuable contribution towards the

future writing of a flora of the whole continent in 0. F. Nyman's ' Conspectus Flor.e

Europseae,' the third part of which was puljlished last year, and completed the

Dicotyledons and Gymnosperms. Although the Conspectus gives no descriptions,

the chaotic mass of synonyms, with which many of our European floras abound,

has been carefully investigated ; and the distribution of each species O'N-er the

continent has been minutely recorded. So tliat the conversion of the conspectus

into a flora would not entail any very large amount of labour. Indeed, may we

not hope that seeing with what universal approbation the conspectus has met with.
Dr. N}'man may Ije induced to enter upon the conversion himself? Such a flora

has never existed. The nearest approach to such a one was Mr. "Wood's ' Tourist's

Flora.' But tliis took in a portion oid}' of Europe, and was in many other respects

an unsatisfactory production.

    7. Among the smaller territorial floras which have appeared, I may mention

the ' Compendio della Flora ItaHana,' by Giovanni .Vrcangeli, which gives a complete

account of the Phanerogams and Vascular Cryptogams of the Italian Peninsula.

    8. In North America we ha'S'e several works of note to remark iipon. First,

we have had a volume containing the botany of that portion of California which is

now included      among  the United  States                                 the PolypetaLoj  of which  are  from  the
                                                                         ;

pens of AV. II. Brewer and Sereno Watson, and the Gamopetalae from that of

Professor Asa Gray.

From Professor ,\,sa Gray we have also the first part of the second volume of a

work entitled, ' Synoptical Flora of North America.' It is intended that this shall

take the place of the ' Flora of North America,' by ToiTey and Gray, but which was

stopped thirty-five years ago at tlie end of the order of Compositse. The present

work begins where the old flora left off, and concludes the description of all the

Gamopefalfe after Compositte. The remaining parts of Vol. II. will include the

Apetalte, Gymnospermfe, Monocotyledons and Vascular Cryptogamia. It is then

intended to rewrite the old flora, adding the new material, which has come in since

its date, and to Issue the new production as Vol. I. of the ' Synoptical Flora.'

These two volmues will describe the plants which grow in that part of Nortli

America which includes Canada and the United States, together with their

adjoining islands, Greenland excepted. The number of species to be described

from this ^ast and Aaried tract of country will probably not fall ftir short of 12,000.

    9. Joining on to this we have the ' Botany of the Biologia Centralis Americani,'

by Mr. W. B. Ilemsley. Two large volumes are already published, while the third

and last one is rapidly progressing. Mr. Hemsley's Flora will include some 15,000

.species, which grow south of the United States, and north of Panama. These two

floras with that of Professor Grisebach's ' Flora of the West Indian Islands,' will

include all that is known of North and Central America with their adjacent

islands.

10. In Soutli America, Martins' magnificent 'Flora of Brazil' has been advanced

by various authors, who have monographed orders or portions of orders. The

length of time over which this vast work has been spread will render a liew edition

necessary, on account of the earlier volumes having become antiquated. When
any such edition is brought out, it is to be hoped that it may partake more of the
--TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ZOOLOGY AMD BOTANY. 587

nature of one of our colonial floras than of ita present form, for the cost of the

present superb work is such as to place it beyond the means of any but the most
wealthy. The plates too, which add so largely to the cost of the present work,

woul<i not be needed.
     11. Leaying- the ' Flora of Brazil ' by yon ftlartius, and turnin|? to the western side

of the Soutli American continent, we have from the pen of Fr. Philippi an
extremely yuluable catalonue of all the plants which are known to gTow in Chili,

together with a revision of their synonyms and a statement concerning the geo-
graphical range of each species. This catalogue, like Nyman's ' Conspectus Florpe

Europoeffi,' will render the writing of a future flora of Chili a comparatively easy
task. Such a flora is greatly needed, for not only is Gay's out of print and very
scarce, but it has also become antiquated.

     These, I think, are the chief floras, or special aids to new floras, which have
appeared during the last eight years, and I pass ou now to the sixth and last head.

6. Detached and miscellaneous specific descriptions.

It A'.-ould be impossible for me to enimierate even the titles of all the papers that

have been written on systematic botany in the diflferent transactions and journals of

the various learned societies, and I shall therefore content myself with mentioning

some few of those which I consider most interesting.

First : In the ' Transactions of the Linnrean Society,' Mr. Bentham, in his revision

of the sub-order Alimosere, has gi^en us another of those beaixtifully complete

reviews of a most difficult group of plants, for which he is so celebrated. Like all

his works of this kind, he presents us not only with descriptions of all the genera

and species, but he also contrasts the characters on which the former are founded,

in such a way as to leave those who study his works perfectly clear as to the
principles by which he has been guided in arriving at a determination as to what

shall be sufficient or insufficient for the formation of his genera and sub-genera.

Under each species he has also given us a complete account of its geographical

distribution ; and he has added extensive lists of all the numbers, which have been
distributed with the dried specimens of the better known collectors. This last

addition is, for those who have the arrangement of herbaria to superintend, of very
great -salue, for it not unfrequently happens that a specimen which may exhibit

many useful and important points, may also just be wanting in some particular

character, without which its right genus or species cannot be determined. The

quotation of the number overcomes the diflSculty, and tluis makes the partially

imperfect specimen of very considerable service. In another volume of the same

Transactions, Professor Oliver and Colonel Grant have given lis an account of all

the species which formed the collection made by the latter gentleman, on his

celebrated expedition with Captain Speke, through that portion of Central Afi'ica

which lies between Gondokoro, Victoria N'yanza, and Zanzibar. This account is
accompanied by 136 plates, containing the portraits of about 140 new or in-

teresting species which had not been previously figured. This is without doubt

the most extensive addition to om- knowledge of the flora of Tropical Africa which

has been made for many years, and which, with Professor Schweinfurth's labours,

has done more than any other work to give us an insight into the vegetable riches

which are yet in store for us in Central Africa.

    I may mention also the following papers of considerable interest which have

-- Abeen printed in the Linntean Society's Transactions: 1. report, by Mr. J. G.

Baker, on some new monocotyledonous plants, from Welwitsch's 'Angolan Her-

Abarium.' 2. review of the ierns of Northern India, by Mr. C. B. Clarke.

    Turning from the ' Transactions ' to the ' Journal of the Linnrean Society, we have

several excellent papers, by Mr. Baker, on many of the genera belonging to the

Wenatural order Liliace╗.  have also from the same botanist an enumeration of

all the known species of Iridacefc, together with descriptions of such as have not
hitherto been described. In the sixteenth volume of the same journal we have a

long and most useful paper by Mr. Ball, entitled Spicilegiu7n Flora Maroccana, in

which all the plants known to grow in the territory of Morocco have been carefully
588 EEPORT-- 1882.

catalogued. Amongst these are many species formerly unknown to science, of
-whicli descriptions, and in many cases plates, have been given. The Spicilegium,
as most botanists here know, was the result of an adventurous raid made by Mr.

Ball into the region of the Atlas countrv^, iu company with Sir Joseph Hooker and
Mr. George Maw, in the early part of the year 1871.

     Dr. Aitchison, surgeon-major in the Bengal Army, iii a long paper, with thirty

plates, containing the portraits of as many new species, gives us the result of his

researches into the botany of the Curam Valley and its neighbourhood, during his

--march with the army luider General Roberts to Cabool a very interesting paper,

when taken in reference to the boundaries of the two great works which treat of

--Southern Asiatic botany viz. Hookers ' Flora of British India ' and Boissier's

' Flora Orientalis.'

     In addition to these papers on descriptive botan}', Mr. Bentham has given us
several, which he has called notes, on the larger and more complicated natural
orders, which he has worked up for the 'Genera Plantarum.' They are

1. Notes on the Gamopetalous Orders belonging to the Campanulaceous and

Oleaceous Group.

2. Notes on Orchidacere.

3. Notes on Cyperace╗.

4. Notes on Graminere.

These notes, however, like those on ^lyrtacere and Compositfp, are philosophical

treatises, in which he lays down the principles by which he has been governed in
determining what characters sliall be taken into consideration for limiting the tribes,

sub-tribes, and genera.

                                                  :

there are mawj papers of much excellence on the lower forms of vegetable life,

there are few on the phanerogamia and higher crjptogams. On the mosses,

however, there are several papers of very considerable interest by M. Emile Besch-

erelle, who has described a large number of new species from the French Antilles,

and from the Reunion Islands. In the ' Botanische Zeitung ' and ' Linntea ' there

are also many papers describing new species of mo.sses from various extra-European

countries by Dr. Carl jMueller, Professor S. O. Lindberg, Geheeb, and the late

Ernest llampe. Besides being indebted to these authors for their contributions to

bryology, we have to thank M. Ilusnot for continuing his very unpretentious but

useful periodical, the ' Revue Bryologique.' Dr. Bruithwaites work on the British

mosses continues to make progress, but it will not render the publication of a
new edition of ' Wilsoji's Bryologia Britannica ' the less desirable.

Perhaps there are few more striking examples of the rapid strides which

civilisation has made of late years in the more distant parts of the world, than the

publication of the 'Scientists Directory.' In this stout volume are recorded the

many hundred names and addresses of all who are interested in the ^ arious branches

of natural science, and who are desirous of collecting specimens of the natural

history of the country iu which they are residing, and of exchanging them for

those of other countries. The arrangement of the directory is partly geographical
and partly alphabetical, and the combination of these two arrangements makes its
consultation A'ery easy. For botanists who wish to study some particular group of

plants, or the flora of some particular district, the ' Scientist's Directory ' will be

indispensable                                                                as by    its  help he will be able to find out  at  once to  whom he may

address himself, with the greatest amount of probability of obtaining the material

or information which he may want.

It would not be fitting for one in the year 1882, who is pretending to give an

account of the progress of systematic botany, to omit all mention of that wonderful

gallery of painthigs which has just been presented to the Royal Gardens at Kew

--by Miss North. This gallery the descriptive catalogue of which by Mr. Hemsley
--has already reached a second edition contains the mo.Фt exquisite sketches of the

more strikinglj- beautiful features of the vegetation which exists in all the four

quarters of the globe. All the paintings are from the brush of Miss North herself,
and whether regarded as accurate representations of the plants which they profess

to portray, or as objects of art, they are equal!}' worthy of our admiration.

4. On the Broiun Colouration of the Southampton Water. By A. Angell,

                                                    Ph.D., F.C.S.

     The author showed that the peculiar colour of the Southampton estuarine water,
which turns to a rusty hrown tint in the summer of each 3-ear, is due solely to the
presence of a small ciliated orgauism, Peredinium fuscum, which is classified by the
best authorities amongst the ciliated protozoa, or microscopic animals. This posi-

tion is generally accepted, but the author, seeing that they evolve oxygen, contain

chlorophyl (plant colour-matter), have no mouth or opening of any kind, never con-
tain foreign bodies, have cellulose walls, and, after death, give off an odoiu- of

decaying sea-weed, is of opinion that they are more plants than animals. He

fiyther sought to show that their presence is due to the large amount of sewage
thrown into the river at and about Southampton. The seaward margin of the
river water is distinctly mapped out by the brown colour, and the autlior noticed
that this never leaves the estuarine basin, and pointed out that a measurement of
the oscillations of this line provides a true index of the tidal motions, and shows
that tlie water in the river is but very slowly, if at all, changed by the rise and fall

of the tides. He showed it was an error to suppose that in tidal rivers and land-

locked estuaries a fresh supply of water is given at every tide, and that, as a matter
of fact, the time needed in which a single change in such waters as Southampton
water will take place is dependent more upon the small flow of fresh water and
surface evaporation than upon tidal influences. It is not, therefore, safe to pollute
tidal waters with sewage; the impression that the filth goes out to sea with the

tide is utterly false. Our peculiar brown colour gives us an indication bv which we

can learn that practically a change of the water of the Southampton Water, and
therefore of all other similarly situated tidal river-mouths and land-locked estuarine
basins, is but very slowly, if ever, effected by the tides. Enough filth, he said, is
poured into the river to make it in hot weather a stinking abomination ; but, in
accordance with nature's provisions against such unnatural proceedings, a vast army
of minute organisms is set to work, and the water is kept tolerably sweet. If it can
be shown 1 hat this creature, whicli is barely visible to the naked eye, performs

--the chief function of plants liberates oxygen-- and is at the same time an animal

and therefore carries on direct nitrification, it is indeed most wonderfullj' adapted,
by tliis double set of powers, to keep our sewage-polluted waters as sweet as is

possible. Notwithstanding the unsightly colour of Peridinium fmcum, we cannot

afford to do without it in our river. When the day comes that the authorities of

Southampton see fit to keep out the sewa<re now flowing into its waters so as to

free thi'm from such pollution, the Peridinium fuscum, no longer needed in such

--vast quantities, will retire into its normal position become less obtrusive, and leave

the water a pure translucent green..

5. On the Distribution and Dates of Spring Migrants in Yorkshire, compared
              toith West of England and Ireland. By T, Lister.

    Not including very rare species which occasionally reach Britain, we may say

Mr. Dixon, late of Sheffield, in the Rivelin Valley).

few comparisons with other parts of the kingdom. The author was struck, during

the visits of the' British Association to the south-west of England and Ireland, by

personal observation and conversation with authorities like the Rev. G. Robinson,

a writer on the ornithology of North Ireland, and Mr. J. J. Watters of Dublin,

author of ' Birds of Ireland,' with the common occurrence of some of our migrants

and the scarcity or absence of others.

warbler, rarely noted, while the nightingale, tree-pipit, lesser-whitethroat, pied

flycatcher, and wood-warbler were not recorded in Ireland. The swallow tribes

were numerous there.

All the migrants in my list are found in the southern, and in most of the

eastern and western counties of England. The pied flj'catcher is exceptionally

rare ; it is recorded by Sterlaud and AVIiittaker in Notts, but rare ; one in Derby-

shire, one Leicestershire, one Kent, one Cornwall, a few in Dorset, Sussex,

and Norfolk. In this part of Yorkshire, of which Barnsle)' is the centre, it is

found at Wliarncliffe, Cannon Hall, and Wentworth Castle parks ; in AVharfdale,

Westmoreland, a few in North Yorkshire, rare about York. The nightingale, one

of the migrants not found in Ireland, rarely crosses the Welsh border, or those of

Devon and Cornwall. It occurs on all sides of Barnsley yearly, about Wakefield,

Leeds, Pontefract more rarely, and, according to Mr. J. Backhouse, specimens have

occasionally occurred near Yorlc. The grasshopper-warbler, scarce in some districts,
may be found pretty numerous in our South Yorkshire woods and hedgerows,

rich in tlie families of our spring warblers.

    An earlier date of cuckoo, seen and heard at 3Ielton-on-the-IIill, March 12,

was reported: 'we had no opportunity to test the statement. The cuckoo and

swallow seen by T. Dymond, Esq., and others at Burntwood Hall, March 19, we
Wecan rely upon.

There have been singular contrasts this season to former years. The two white-

throats, grasshopper-warbler, night-jar, spotted flycatclier, and whinchat were

seven or ten days before tlieir average time ; the wheatear, land-rail, pied

flycatcher and martin (as reported in this part), are about a week behind their

time. Tlie sprins: migrants, as noted in onr local excursions, and with some of

the ' Yorkshire Naturalist Union's ' rambles this season, have been observed in

considerable niunbers. The well-wooded tracts of South and West Yorkshire,

diversified with cidtivated lands, streams, and moorland hills, form favourable
haunts for our summer warblers. Other migrants, as ring-ousels, on our moors
reed-warblers among marshes and reedy pools ; sand-pipers, by moorland streams
and wliite wagtails scarce, have not had data regularly recorded.

     The author stated tliat tlie most daugerous parasites were Bilharzia hfematohia
 and Anchylostoma duodenale. To avoid infection by the larvte the following rules
 were recommended :

      1. To select for drinking purposes, whenever procur.ible, either deep well water,

 or water from a spring collected at or near its source.

      2. To avoid the use of stagnant water of any kind, especially that procured from

 tanks or shallow pools.

       3. If the only water available for drinking purposes has been obtained from a
 doubtful source, it must either be thoroughly filtered or boiled : merely straining

 through muslin or other of the coarser kinds of filter is useless. On excursions or

 shooting expeditions a pocket filter must be carried.
      4. Avoid partaking of all salads made with vegetables grown either in market

 gardens or in open situations frequented by natives of uncleanlj- habits. Lettuces,
 water-cresses, and other uncooked vegetables, even when they are known to have
 been cultivated in favourable situations, require to be carefully washed with clean
 water befoie use. Only spring water, well water, filtered water, boiled water, and
distilled water can be pronounced as absolutely safe : springs near human habita-
tions are liable to become contaminated.'

5. On a neio Principle affedlvg the sijstematic Bistribution of the Tor-

     on the British Coast. By E. DU Bois-Reymond, F.B.S., Professor of

       Physiology in the University of Berlin.

     Professor Gustavus Fritsch, who is at the head of the biological department of

my physiological laboratory, is engaged in a series of researches on electric fishes,

which he has pursued, since last autumn, in Egypt, Asia Minor, and on the shores
of the Mediterranean, at the cost of the Humboldt Foun<lafion for Natural Science

and Travels, dependent on the Berlin Academj- of Sciences. Among Professor
Fritseh's results there is one which, highly remarkable in itself, seems to me

particularly calculated to interest British zoologists, and I therefore venture to ay
before the Section a brief abstract of this pai-t of his work.

     The researches of Professor Babuchin of Moscow, on the development of the
electric organs of the torpedo, have established beyond a doubt that these organs
are formed by the metamorphosis of striated muscle, and that, once formed, they
increase in size only by the growth of the columns or prisms of which they consist,
and of the transverse septa of tliese columns, never by the formation of new
columns and septa, or of new electric elements. Setting aside individual variation
the number of columns, therefore, is the same in j'oung and in adult specimens.

     The latter fact had already been stated, many years ago, by delle Chiaie of

Naples, and he had arrived at the same conclusion as Professor Babuchin. Later
on, the preformation of electric elements was impugned by Professor Valentin

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

but Rudolpli A\^agner, with the assistance of Professor Ijeuckart, then one of his
pupils, proved delle Chiaie's statement to be correct, for he found about the same

number of columns in the foetus of torpedo and in the adult fish. As the law of
the preformation of electric elements was first established by means of a census of
the columns in young and adult specimens by delle Chiaie, and afterwards deduced

from embryological facts, and, as it will be seen, generalised by Professor Babuchin,
it appears proper to stjde it delle Chiaie's and Babuchin 's law.

     Professor Babuchin, by embryological investigation, has shown the same law to
apply to the imperfect electric organs of the common ray, oidy that these organs
are formed of striated muscle which in its development has reached maturity,
whilst the organs of torpedo are formed of muscle in an embryonic state.

Medical Journal, September 16, 1882.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B. DEPT. ZOOLOGY AND BOTANT. 593

       In spite of Professor Babuchin's and of Dr. Sachs' exertions, tlie development
 of Malopterurus and of Gymnotus unfortunately is still wrapped in mystery. Pro-

 fessor Babuchin, however, conlidentl}' extends his law to Malopterurus, as the size

 of Bilharz' electric plates varies in proportion to the size of the fish.

     In my work on Gymnotus/ b)' combining the results of former observers with

 those of the lamented Dr. Sachs, I have proved the number of colunuis to be the
 same in large and in small specimens, again taking into account individual varia-
 tion. Professor Fritsch has confirmed this statement by a new and careful census
 of the columns in several specimens widely differing in size.^

     It is not my intention on this occasion to enter upon the many important

 inferences which maj^ be drawn from delle Chiaie's and Babuchin's law. This law,
 indeed, has become a leading ftict in the physiology as well as in the embryology

 of the electric organs. For instance, an obvious conclusion from it is the following.
 The number of electric plates remaining the same, and their thickness only increasing
 with the size of thje fish, whilst the electromotive force of the discharge also increases,

 the difference of potential engendered by every plate is evidently proportionate to
its thickness. Now, as the difference of potential does not depend upon the size of

the bodies by whose reciprocal action it is produced, we are unavoidably led to

 conclude that in a thicker electric plate there is a i-epetition, and consequently a

 multiplication, of the difference of potential in proportion to its thickness.

     But my wish here is to direct the attention of the Section to the part which

delle Chiaie's and Babuchin's law seems destined to play in the systematic distribu-

 tion of the Torpedinidfe. According to it, the number of columns in the electric

organs of a species of Torpedinidse, is, from a certain stage of its development, a

given one. This number may be the same, or nearly the same, in distinct species
of Torpedinidse. But if, in two specimens which do not otherwise show very mai-ked
specific characters, the number of columns differs more than the range of individual

variation fairly permits, the .specimens ought to be pronounced specifically distinct.
In other words, the average number of columns ought, henceforward, to form part
 of the diagnosis of a species of Torpedinidse.

      Hitherto this point has been entirely overlooked by zoologists. Elaborate papers
were published on the system of the Torpedinidfe," in which the number of the
columns is not even mentioned. The whole literature on torpedo from Hunter's
time down to Professor Fritsch's new researches, did not comprise more than six-

teen enumerations of columns, on only fourteen specimens.^ They were all of them
made, as it was understood at the time, on common European species, T. manno-

rata, occllata, Galmnii, excepting one, by Professor Henle, on his Narcine (now
Astrape) dipterygia, from the South Sea. This species offered the unusually small
number of 130 columns. The other species yielded numbers ii-om about 300 to
about 500, excepting, however, one of two very large torpedines, of 4 ft. in
length and 50 lbs. weight, which in 1773 were caught off Torbay, and examined

by the illustrious John Hunter. He counted 1,182 columns in one of their organs.
As he had counted 470 columns in one of the organs of an 18-inch specimen of
the common torpedo, and as he took for granted that these huge torpedines were

simply older individuals of the same species, he by this single observation was led
to tlie erroneous conclusion that the columns increase, ' not only in size but in
number, during the growth of the animal, new ones forming perhaps every year on

the exterior edge, as there they are mucli the smallest.' This process, he a'dds, may
be similar to the formation of new teeth in the human jaw, as it increases; and for

more than sixty years this bold assumption of Hunter's has reigned undisputed in
all the text-books of zoology and physiology.

      Hunter, however, could not have chosen a less felicitous illustration. After a

certain stage of development is over, new columns form as little in the electric
organ of torpedo as new teeth in the human jaw. The true conclusion to be drawn

from the enumerations of columns hitherto extant is that which J maintained in

my book on Gymnotus, viz. that K. dipteryifia proves a good species also by the

new test of the number of columns, whereby the value of this test is confirmed
and that the two large specimens of Torbaj^ belonged to another species than the
common European Torpedinidje. They may have been, as I ventured to surmise,

remnants of the T. gigantea, whose relics, of about the same size as Hunter's fish,
occur in the Eocene strata of Monte Bolca, and show that even in those remote
geological times Nature had solved the problem of building a most powerful

electrical machine out of the common materials of the animal tissues.

     This conclusion has become the starting-point of Professor Fritsch's researches
on the system of Torpedinidse, made at Alexandria, Suez, Sm}'rna, Naples, and

Trieste. Michele Girardi, who ten years after Hunter published some observations

on the electric organs of torpedo, stated that the number of columns is not always
the same in both organs. But previous to Professor Fritsch nobody had even
thought of inquiring whether the number of columns is the same in the dorsal and
in the ventral surface of the organs. According to Professor Fritsch, the ventral
surface offers the greater number, although the diii'erence decreases with the
accuracy of the method employed.

    Professor Fritsch, by many careful enumerations, first confirmed delle Chiaie's,
Rudolph Wagner's, and Professor Leuckart's statement regarding the equality of the

nvmibers of columns yielded by small and by large specimens of the same species.

He then ascertained that the number of columns in one organ of 7". marmorata and

ocellata varies from 400 to -500 ; that T. mantKirata probably has, on the a-\'erage,
a few columns more than T. ocellata ; and thfit the number of columns is ranch

the same in T. pnnthera, Ehrbg., from the Red Sea, and also in K. hrasiUevsis.

A variety of T. mnnnorafn occurs at Alexandria, Naples, and Trieste, which

Professor Fritsch calls anntilata on account of darlc, ring-shaped spots on its back
and tail ; this variety, whicli perhaps is identical with the ill-defined T. Nobiliana,

Bonaparte, has a greater number of columns than the common T. marmorata, viz.

from 500 to 600.
     These results seemed more and more to confirm the view that Hunter's large

torpedines were a new species. On his way home Professor Fritsch visited the
Zoological Museum at Vienna, hoping to meet there with a specimen of the fossil
T. gigantea of Monte Bolca. lu this expectation he was deceived, but the key to

the enigma of Hunter's big fish awaited him in another shape.
     The director of the museum, Professor Steindachner, told him that he had

brought from America the two only specimens existing in Europe of a very remark-
able species of torpedo, and they were still in his possession. This was the T.
occidentalis of David Humphreys Storer of Boston, which that distinguished
ichthyologist described forty years ago, but which is not mentioned in otherwise
very complete accounts of the tribe, and in Dr. Giinther's Catalogue of the Fishes

of the British Museum its name only is quoted in a footnote. At certain periods

large numbers of T. occidentalis run ashore on the sandy beach of Cape Cod. It
is by far the largest electric fish, as it attains a length of five feet and a weight

of 200 pounds. The largest gymuoti of the Amazon are said by old IMonteiro to

attain forty pounds weight. Its electric stroke is formidable. Captain Nathaniel

E. Atwood of Provincetown, to whom science is indebted for the first notice of

the fish, relates that several times he was ' thrown upon the ground by it as quick
if he had been knocked down with an axe.'

      I need not dwell here on other peculiarities of the T. Occidentalls, a detailed
account of which is found iu Storer's papers. The most important specific character

of the new species, however, evaded Storer's attention, and it fell to Professor
Fritsch's lot to detect it forty years later in the Vienna Museum. Professor
 Steindachner kindly permitted the skin to be removed from one of the organs of

 each of his fish, and Professor Fritsch found nearly the same number-of columns as
 Hunter in his large torpedo, viz. 1,037 columns iu the better preserved specimen of
 the two, and also about 1,000 in the other.

      There can hardly be any doubt, after this, that Hunter's fish were specimens of
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ]

     Delle Cbiaie's and Batucbin's law has thus proved the means of solving a zoological

    puzzle of a hundred years' standing ; and surely this result may serve to recommend

      it to the attention of those interested in this subject.

          I have been so fortunate as to meet with two more instances of the probable
     capture of T. occidenialis in the records of British natiu-al history. The well-known

    naturalist, Colonel Montagu, who died iu 1815, relates that a torpedo weighing
     about a hundred pounds, twice as heavy as Hunter's hsh, was found dead on
     a turbot-hook off "Tenby. Even the oldest fishermen did not know the creature

     which proves the case to be a very rare one. In the year 1840, William Thompson'

    Vice-President of the Natural History Society of Belfast, saw in the Museum of

     the Dublin College of Surgeons the cast of a torpedo thirty-eight inches lono- and

    twent3--eight inches broad, which had been caught oft' Dublin in 1830. I know of
     no instance of a European torpedo approaching this size. The coincidence with
     Hunter's observation was not perceived in either case, and I need hardly add that

     the columns were not numbered.

         However rare the event may be, it is exceedingly improbable that these three

   --cases--Hunter's, Montagu's, and AVilliam Thompson's, separated from one another

     by an interval of about thirty years sliould have been, and remain, the only ones

    of their kind. And now my aim, in bringing these facts before the Section will, I

     trust, be apparent. I venture to express a wish that those British zoologists 'in

    whose power it may be may issue instructions to the fishermen, more part?cularly

     on the south-western coast of iMigland, to the eflfect that if, in one of their expedi-
     tions, they should meet with a huge flat fish, similar to a ray, but of circular
     instead of rhombic shape, and endo^^-ed during life with a power of benumbino- the
     hand that grasps it, they are requested to preserve such fish with the utmost care
     and to forward it as speedily as possible to the nearest scientific station. It is
     needless to indicate the further course to be held. The specimen should be com-
     pared with Storer's description of his T. occidentalis, and above all, the columns

     in its electric organs numbered according to the rules laid down bv Professor

       Fritsch.

           Since Henle's paper on X. dipterygia, this species has been detached from

    X. hrasiliensis, and annexed to the genus Asfrape as A. capeims. In mv Preliminarv

     Pieport on Professor Fritsch's Results, read before the Berlin Academy,' I expressed
     an opinion that A. capensis would present a number of columns about as small
     as A. dipterygia, and so it proved, a specimen which Professor Peters readily

    placed at Professor Fritsch's disposal, showing only 14G columns. On the other

     hand, T. californica, which bears a great resemblance to T. occidentalis has like
      this species, nearly 1,000 columns.

          The value of the new character of Torpedinidas being thus fullv established
     Professor Fritsch proceeded to test by it every species he could lay his hands upon'
     by taking the census of its columns. After having gone over the' specimens of the
     Berlin Museum, he came to London a few weeks ago, and owin" to the extreme
    kindness of Professor Owen and Dr. Giinther, he was allowed to continue his work
     in the splendid collection of the British Museum. Of the results at which he

   Aarrived, I shall only mention one here, leaving the other for his own publication.
         single glance at the unique and typical .specimen of the T. hebetans, Lowe, froni
     Madeira, enabled him to predict, from a certain conformity of habitus with T.
     occidentalis and califor?iica, that this species, although not quite ten inches Ion?
     would present an equally large number of columns, and he eventually counted'
     1,025 of them in one of the organs.

         He also saw in the Museum of the College of Surgeons a relic of one of

     Hunter's specimens, exhibiting the brain and the electrical nerves ; but although in

    a wonderful state of preservation after so many years, this interesting preparation
     was of no use to him for his present purpose,' as one of the organs had been

     entirely, and the other partially removed.

6. Preliminanj Note on Ceplialodiscns, a new form allied to Prof. Alhnan's

    Rhabdopleura dredged in H.M.S. ' Challenger.' ' By Professor

     McIntosh, F.B.S.

     This peculiar form was dredged at Station 311 (in the Strait of Magellan), and
at first sight resembles a somewhat massive sea-weed, to which the ccenceciuin is
allied in consistence, while the whole surface is hispid with long spinous processes
of the same tissue. This ccenacium is secreted hy the minute inhabitants, which,
though quite free, are closely allied in structure to Rhabdopleura, an opinion inde-

pendently arrived at by Professors Allman and Busk, who kindly requested the

author (who had latelj' received the specimens from Mr. Murraj', Director of

the Challenger Commission) to continue the description.
     The ccenacium consists of thickish, semi-transparent, irregularly moulded

branches, ranging from about 3 mm. to upwards of 5 mm. in diameter, and form-

ing arborescent tufts, which apparently have been fi:x;ed to submarine bodies, such
as stones, sponges, &c., both by the ends and sides. The whole is permeated by
irregular canals and cavities, which open on the surface, often near the bases of the
spines. In these cavities are found the free polypides, often in groups, and nume-

rous large ova.

     Each adult has a somewhat bean-shaped body, with a pedicle posteriorly-

continuous with the ventral surface, the whole measuring about 2 mm. The an-

terior end is rounded : indeed often very prominent from the contained ova, two of
which are conspicuous. Tlie ventral surface of this region bears two very large
eyes. The body is bulbous posteriorly. In front of the mouth a great buccal disc
overlaps the neighbouring parts, and is probably the chief agent in secreting the

coencecium . In front of it are twelve' long and richly pinnate, branchial, or tentacular
organs, which arise from a base devoid of a web, and each of which has a peculiarly
enlarged tip. Behind the nioutli is a broad apron-like membranous lamella. The
body-wall is formed of a thin hypodermic and an elastic layer, bounded by longi-
tudinal fibres internally. The pedicle has the same dermal coverings as the body,
and internally consists of strong longitudinal muscular fibres, continued from the

ventral surface anteriorly.

    The mouth opens above the buccal shield, at the upper margin of the mem-

branous lamella, and leads into a simple alimentary canal, which bends forward at

the posterior end of the body, and proceeds along the dorsum, to terniinate in the
anus on the prominent anterior end of the body. The food which enters the month
must pass between the great flattened shield, on the one haud, and the membranous

post-oral lamella, on the other.
     Immediately above the eyes are the two greatly developed ova, and towards

the middle of the body several smaller ova. These seem to arise from a spot nearly
identical with the ' remarkable organ ' in Pedicellina, and to be homologous with a

double organ of similar nature in the embryo of Loxosoma. When discharged

these ova are attached to the wall of the cavities of the coencecium by a process or

pedicle of the hyaline investment. Their size is remarkable.

     In addition to the foregoing mode of propagation, very active budding takes

place at the tip of the pedicle of the adult, the buds being found in all stages, from

a minute rounded or clavate process up to a fairly formed specimen. Even in the
earlier stages the buccal shield is conspicuous. The branchial or tentacular plumes

first appear as globular papillre on the dorsum of the shield. Two or three buds
occur on many specimens. This new form will open up interesting comparisons

with Doliolum and others having buds on processes.                                         ^
     The occurrence of these large ova anteriorly, and the numerous buds on the tip

of the pedicle posteriorly, bears out Professor Allman's objection to Oscar Schmidt's
view that the apparent buds in Loxosoma are really eggs detached from the ovary

and developed on the body of the parent.

                     THURSDAY, AUGUST 24.

The Chairman delivered the following Address :

On the Present Phase of the Antiquity of Man.

In taldng the chair in this department of the biological section of the British

Association, two courses lie open before me. I might give an address which

should be a histoi'y of the progress of anthropology during the last year, or I might

devote myself to some special branch. The swift development of our young and

rapidly growing science, which embraces within its scope all that is known, not

merely about man, but about his environment, in present and past times, renders

the first and more ambitious course peculiarly difficult to one, like myself, labouring

under the pressure of many avocations. I am therefore driven to adopt the second

and the easier, by choosing a subject with which I am familiar, and which appears

to me to be appropriate in this place of meeting. I propose to place before you the

present phase of the inquiiy into the antiquity of man, and to point out what we

--know of the conditions of life though our knowledge of them is imperfect and
--fragmentary under which man has appeared in the Old and in the New Worlds.

The rudely chipped implements left by the primeval hunters iu the beds of gravel of

Hampshire and Wiltshire, and along the shores of Southampton Water and else-

where, are eloquent of the presence of man iu this district at a time when there was

no Southampton Water and the elephant and the reindeer wandered over the site of

this busy mart for ships                                                                                                               when the Isle of Wight was not  an  island  and  the  River-
                                                                                                                                    ;

drift hunter could walk across from Portsmouth to Oowes, with no obstacle ex-

cepting that offered by the rivers and morasses. I propose to enter upon the

labours of Prestwich, Evans, Stevens and Blackmore, Codrington, Read, Brown,

and other investigators in this country, and to combine the results of their

inquiries with those in other countries, and with some observations of my own
which I was able to make in 1880, during my visit to the United States.

the frontier of history. The living orders appear in the Eocene, the living genera

in time, fall into the shape of a genealogical tree, with its trunk hidden in the Secon-
dary period, and its branchlets (the living species) passing upwards from the

Pleiocene, a tree of life, with living Mammalia for its fruit and foliage. Were the

extinct species taken into account, it would be seen that they fill up the intervals
separating one living form from another, and that they too grow more and more
like the living forms as they approach nearer to the present day. It must be re-
membered tliat in the above deiinitions the fossil marsupials are purposely ignored
because they began their specialisation in the Secondary period, and had arrived in

opossum {Didelphys).

It -will be seen, from the examination of the above table, that our inquirj

into the antiquity of man is limited to the last four of the divisions. The most

si^ecialised of all animals cannot be looked for until the higher Mammalia by
Wewhich he is now surrounded were ali\e.
                                          cannot imagine him in the Eocene

age, at a time when animal life was not sufficiently differentiated to present us with

any living genera of placental mammals. Nor is there any probability of his

having appeared on the earth in the Meiocene, because of the absence of higher

placental mammals belonging to living species. It is most unlikely that man
should have belonged to a fauna in which no other living species of mammal

was present. He belongs to a more advanced stage of evolution than the mid-

Meioceue of Thenay, as may be seen by a reference to the preceding table. Up to

this time the evolution of the animal kingdom had advanced no farther than the

Simiadie in the direction of man, and the apes then haunting the forests of Italy,

France, and Germany represent the highest type of those on the earth,

   We may also look at the question from another point of view. If man were

upon the earth in the Meiocene age, it is incredible that he should not have become

something else in the long lapse of ages, and during the changes in the conditions of

life by which all the Meiocene land Mammalia have been so profoundly affected,

that they have been either exterminated, or have assumed new forms. It is im-

possible "to believe that man should have been an exception to the law of change,

to which all the higher Mammalia have been subjected since the Meiocene age.
    Nor in the succeeding PleioceJie age can we expect to hnd man upon the earth,

because of the very few living species of placental mammals then alive. The

evidence brought forward by Professor Oapellini, in favour of Pleiocene man in

ItRly, seems both to me and to Ur. Evans unsatisfactory-, and that advanced by

Professor Whitney in support of the existence of Pleiocene man in North America,

cannot in my opinion be maintained. It is not until we arrive at the succeeding

stage, or the Pleistocene, when living species of Mammalia begin to abound, that

we meet with indisputable traces of the presence of man on the earth.

                                   The Pleistocene Period.

    As a preliminary to our inquiry we must first of all define what is meant by the

Pleistocene Period. It is the equivalent of the Quaternary of the French, and the

Postpleiocene of the older works of Lyell, and it includes all the phenomena known
in latitudes outside the Arctic Circle, where ice no longer is to be found, under the
name of glacial and inter-glacial. It is characterised in Europe, as I have pointed

out in my work on 'Early Man in Britain,' by the arrival of living species,- which
may be conveniently divided into five groups, according to their present habitats.

The first consists of those now found in the temperate zones of Europe, Asia, and

Nortli America. It includes the following animals :

    Mole, musk shrew, common shrew, mouse, beaver, hare, pika, pouched marmot,

water-vole, red field-vole, short-tailed field-vole, continental field-vole, lynx,

wild cat, wolf, fox, marten, ermine, stoat, otter, brown bear, grisly bear, badger,

horse, bison, urus, saiga antelope, stag, roe, fallow-deer, wild boar.

     The second consists of animals of arctic habit :
     Russian vole, Norwegian lemming, arctic lemming, varying hare, musk sheep,

reindeer, arctic fox, glutton.

     The third is composed of those which enjoy the cold climate of moimtains :
     The snowy vole, Alpine marmot, chamois, and ibex.
      These animals invaded Europe from Asia, and as the cold increased the tempe-
rate group found their way into Southern Europe and Northern Africa, while the
arctic division pushed as far south as the Alps and Pyrenees.

   --The fourth group of invading forms is represented by animals now only foimd in

warm countries :

      Porcupine, lion, panther, African lynx,Caffre cat, spotted hyena, striped hyena,

and African elephant.
      This group of animals is found as far to the north as Yorkshire, and as far to the
600 BEPORT-- 1882.

west as Ireland. Among tlie southern animals, too, must be reckoned the hippo-

potamus, which lived as far north as Britain in the Pleiocene age, and in the
Pleistocene occurs in caves and river-deposits, in intimate association with some
arctic species, such as the remdeer.

     The fifth group is composed of extinct species, hitherto unknown in Europe

in the Pleistocene age, such as

     The straight-tusked elephant, mammoth, the pigmy elephants, woolly and small-

nosed rhinoceroses, the Irish elk, pigmj^ hippopotamus, and the cave hear.

     The question as to which of these groups the River-drift man belongs must he
deferred till we can take a survey of the evidence elsewhere.

     The early Pleistocene division is characterised by the presence of the temperate
and southern species in Britain ; the middle stage hj the presence of the arctic,
but not in full force ; and the late Pleistocene by the abundance of arctic animals,
not only in Britain, but on the Continent as far as the Alps and Pyrenees, and the
lower valley of the Danube.

The EaELT PLEISTOCElfE FOEEST AND MAMMALS OF EaST AnGLIA.

The first view which we get of the Pleistocene IMammaha in this coimtry is

offered by the accumulations associated with the buried forest of East Anglia. It

extends for more than 40 miles along the shores of Norfolk and Suflblk, from

Cromer to Kessingland, passing into the cliff" on the one hand and beneath the sea

on the other. The forest was mainly composed of sombre Scotch firs and dark

clustering yews, relieved in the summer by the lighter tinted foliage of the spruce

and the oak, and in the winter by the silvery gleam of the birches, that clustered

thickly with the alders in the marshes, and stood out from a dense undergrowth of

sloes and hazels. Among the animals living in this forest of the North Sea were

species which haunted the valleys of the Upper Seine at the time, such as the

southern elephant, the Etruscan rhinoceros, the deer of the Carnutes, extinct

horses, and the large extinct beaver. There were in addition the shaggy-maned

mammoth, the straight-tusked elephant, and the big-nosed rhinoceros. The stag,

the roe, the Irish elk, were in the glades, Sedgwick's deer with its many-pointed

antlers, the verticorn deer, and the gigantic urus. The undergrowth formed a

covert for the wild boar, and for beasts of prey, many in species and formidable in

niunbers: the cave bear, the hugest of its kind, the sabre-toothed lion, the wolf,

the fox, and the wolverine, iimong the smaller animals were to be noted the musk

shrew, the common shrew, and a vole. In the trees were squirrels. Underfoot

the moles raised their hillocks of earth, and from between the lofty fronds of the

king-fern beavers were to be seen building their lodges, and the hippopotamus

as he emerged from the water and disappeared in the forest. Out of thirty species

identified, no less than seventeen are living in some part of the world, and we have

there obviously the stage in the evolution of mammalian life when the living species

Wewere becoming more abundant than the extinct.       may note, too, the absence of

arctic animals in this fauna, more particularly of the reindeer.

The presence of these animals in Norfolk and Suflblk implies that at this time

Britain was united to the Continent, and the presence of fossil species found in

France indicates a southern extension of land in the direction of the Straits of

Dover. The forest covered a large portion of the area of the North Sea, and in all

probability the Atlantic seaboard was then at the lOO-fathom line of the west

coast of Ireland.

No traces of man have as yet been discovered in these deposits, although the

large percentage of living species of higher Mammalia indicates that the geological

clock had struck the hour when he may be looked for.

   The Appearance of the River-drift Hunter at Cratford and Eeith.

     The living species in the forest-bed are to be looked upon as an advanced guard
of a great migration of Asiatic and African species, finding their way into North-
western Eiu-ope, over the plains of Russia, and over barriers of land connecting
              --TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEFT. ANTIIROrOLOGY.      601

Nortliern Africa with Spain by way of Gibraltar, and with Italy by way of Malta

and Sicily.'

In the course of time other living species followed, and the extinct species

became more rare. In the deposits, for instance, of the ancient Thames, at Ilford

and Grays Tburrock in Essex, and at Erith and Crayford in Kent, out of tM-enty-

--six species, six only belong to extinct forms the new-comers comprising the lionj
Awild cat, spotted hyena, and otter, the bison, and the musk sheep.
                                                                     flint flake

discovered by the Rev. Osmund Fisher, at Crayford, and a second discovered by

Messrs. ("headle and Woodward, at Erith, prove that man was present in the valley

of the Thames at this time ; while the more recent discoveries of Mr. Flaxman

Spurrell indicate the very spots where the palaeolithic hunter made his implements,

and prove that he used implements of the River-drift type, so widely distributed

over the surface of the earth. The arctic animals at this time were present, but

not in full force, in Southern Britain, and the innumerable reindeer which charac-

terise the later deposits of the Pleistocene age had not, so far an we know, taken

possession of the valley of the Thames.

    To what stage in the Pleistocene period are we to refer these traces of the
River-drift hunter? The only answer which I am able to give is that the associated

animals are intermediate between the Forest-bed group and that which characterises

the late Pleistocene division in the region extending from the Alps and the Pyre-

nees as far north as Yorkshire. Nor am I able to form an opinion about their

relation to the submergence of Middle or Northern Britain under the waves of the

glacial sea. They are quite as likely to be pre- as post- glacial.

     Thu Relation of the River-brift Hunter of the Late Pleistocene

                                     TO THE Glacial Subiiergence.

      The rudely chipped implements of the River-drift hunter lie scattered through
 the late Pleistocene river deposits in Southern and Eastern England in enormous
 abundance, and as a rule in association with the remains of animals of arctic and of

 warm habit, as well as some or other of the extinct species of remdeer and hippo-
potamus, along with mammoth and woolly rhinoceros. What is their relation to

 the submergence of the land and the lowness of the temperature, which combined
 together have resulted in the local phenomena known as glacial and interglacial ?

      The geographical change in Northern Europe at the close of the Forest-bed age
 was very great. The forest of the North Sea sank beneath the waves, and Britain
was depressed to a depth of no less than 2,.300 feet in the "Welsh mountains, and
was reduced to an archipelago of islands, composed of what are now the higher
lands. The area of the English Channel also was depressed, and the ' silver streak
was somewhat wider than it is now, as is proved by the raised beach at Brighton,
at Bracklesham, and elsewhere, which marks the sea line of the largest island of
the archipelago, the southern island, as it may be termed, the northern shores of
which extended along a line passing from Bristol to London. The northern shore
of the Continent at this time extended eastwards from Abbeville north of the
Erzgebirge, through Saxony and Poland, into the middle of Russia, Scandinavia
being an island from which the glaciers descended into the sea.

     This geographical change was accompanied by a corresponding change in climate.
Glaciers descended from the higher mountains to the sea-level, and icebergs, melt-
ing as they passed southwards, deposited their burdens of clay, sand, and erratics,
which occupy such a wide area in the portions then submerged of Britain and the

Continent.

     This depression was followed by a re-elevation, by which the British isles again
formed part of the Continent, and all the large tract of country within the 100-
fathom line again became the feeding-grounds of the late Pleistocene Mammalia.

    An appeal to the animals associated Avith tlie River-drift implements will not

help us to fix the exact relation of man to these changes, because they were in

Britain before as well as after the submergence, and were living throughout in
those parts of Europe which were not submerged. It can only be done in areas

                                       ' See Cave Hunting and Early Man.
--602 REPORT 1882.

where the submergence is clearly defined. At Salisbury, for instance, the River-
drift hunter may have lived either before, during, or after the southern counties
became an island. When, however, he hunted the woolly and leptorhine rhinoceros,
the mammoth, and the horse in the ueighbom-hood of Brighton, he looked down

upon a broad expanse of sea, in the spring flecked with small icebergs, such as

those which dropped their burdens in Bracklesham Bay. At Abbeville, too, he
hunted the mammoth, reindeer, and horse down to the mouth of the Somme on the

 shore of the glacial sea.

     The evidence is equally clear that the Eiver-drift hunter followed the chase in
Britain after it had emerged from beneatli the waters of the glacial sea, from the
fact that the river-deposits in which his implements occur either rest upon the glacial
clays, or are composed of fragments derived from them, as in the oft-quoted cases
of Iloxne and Bedford. Further, it is ^ery probable that he may have wandered
close up to the edges of the glaciers then covering the higher hills of Wales and

the Pennine chain.
     The severity of the climate in winter at this time in Britain is proved, not

merely by the presence of the arctic animals, but by the numerous ice-borne
blocks in the river gravels dropped in the spring after the break-up of the

frosts.

     The River-drift man is proved, by the implements which he left behind, to have

wandered over the whole of France, and to have hunted the same animals in the
valleys of the Loire and the Garonne as in the valley of the Thames. In the
Iberian peninsula lie was a contemporary of the African elephant, the mammoth,
and the straiglit-tusked elephant, and he occupied the neighbourhood both of

Madrid and Lisbon. He also ranged over Italy, leaving traces of his presence in the

Abruzzo, and in Greece he was a contemporary of the extinct pigmy hippopotamus
{H. Pentlandi). South of the Mediterranean his implements have been met with

in Oran, and near Kolea in Algeria, and in Egypt in several localities. At Luxor they
have been discovered by General Pitt-Rivers in the breccia, out of which are hewn
the tombs of the kings. In Palestine they have been obtained by the Abbe
Richard between Mount Tabor and the Sea of Tiberias, and by j\Ir. Stopes between

Jerusalem and Bethlehem. Throughout this wide area the implements, for the
most part of flint or of quartzite, are of the same rude types, and tliere is no differ-
ence to be noted between the Juiches found in the caves of CressweU in Derbyshire,

and those of Thebes, or between those of the valley of the Somme and those of

Palestine. Nor is our survey yet ended.

                            The River-deiet Man in India.

   The researches of Foote, King, Medlicott, Hacket, and BaU establish the fact that

the River-drift himter ranged over the Indian peninsula from Madras as far north

as the valley of the Nerbudda. Here we find him forming part of a fauna in which
there are species now living in India, such as the Indian rhinoceros and the arnee,

and extinct types of oxen and elephants. There were two extinct hippopotami in
the rivers, and li-\-ing gavials, turtles, and tortoises. It is plain, therefore, that at
this time the fauna of India stood in the same relation to the present fauna as the

European fauna of the late Pleistocene does to that now living in Europe. In both
there was a similar association of extinct and living forms, from both in the lapse
of time the genus Hippopotamus has disappeared, and in both man forms the

central figure.

                     The Rivee-drifx Hunter is North America.

    We are led from the region of tropical India to the banks of the Delaware in New

Jersey by the recent discoveries of Dr. C. C. Abbott in the neighbourhood of Trenton.

After a study of his collections in the Peabody Museum at Cambridge, Mass., I
--TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANTIIROrOLOGT.  603

 had the opportunity of examining all the specimens found up to that time, and of
visiting the locality in company with Dr. Abbott and Professors Ilaynes and Lewis.
 The implements are of the same type as those of the river gravels of Europe, and
 occur under exactly the same conditions as those of France and Britain. Thej^ are
 found in a plateau of river gravel forming a terruce overlooking the river, and
composed of materials washed down from the old terminal moraine which strikes

across the State of New Jersey to the westward. The large blocks of stone and

 the general character of the gravel point out that during the time of its accumula-

tion there were ice-rafts floating down the Delaware in the spring, as in the Tliames,
the Seine, and the Somme. According to Professor Lewis it was formed during
 the time when the glacier of the Delaware was retreating ('late glacial'), or at a
later period (' post-glacial '). The physical evidence is clear that it belongs to the
 same age as deposits with similar remains in Britain. The animal remains also point

Ato the same conclusion. tusk of mastodon is in Dr. Cooke's collection at Brunswick,

New Jersey, obtained from the gra-^-el, and Dr. Abbott records the tooth of a rein-

 deer and tiie bones of a bison from Trenton. Here, too, living and extinct species

 are found side by side.

     Thus in our survey of the group of animals surrounding man when he first
appeared in Europe, India, and North America, we see that in all three regions, so

widely removed from each other, the animal life was in the same stage of evolution,
and 'the old order ' was yielding ' place unto the new.' The Biver-drift man is

proved by his surroundings to belong to tbe Pleistocene age in all three.

     The evidence of Palaeolithic man in South Africa seems to me unsatisfactory,

because as yet the age of the deposits in which the implements are found has not

 been decided.

                                         General CoNCLtrsioxs.

     It remains now for us to sum up the results of this inquiry, in which we have
been led very far afield. The identity of the implements of the River-drift hunter
proves that he was in the same rude state of civilisation, if it can be called civili-
sation, in the Old and New Worlds, when the hands of the geological clock pointed
to the same hour. It is not a little strange that his mode of life shoidd have been

the same in the forests to the north and south of the Mediterranean, in Palestine,
in the tropical forests of India, and on the western shores of the Atlantic. Tbe
hunter of the reindeer in the valle}^ of the Delaware was to all intents and purposes
the same sort of savage as the hunter of the reindeer on the banks of the Wiley or
of the Solent. It does not, however, follow that this identity of implements implies

that the same race of men were spread over tliis vast tract. It points rather to a
primeval condition of savagery from which mankind has emerged in the long ages
which separate it from our own time.

     It may further be inferred, from his wide-spread range, that the River-drift
man (assuming that mankind sprang from one centre) must have inhabited the

earth for a long time, and that his dispersal took place before the glacial submer-
gence and the lowering of the temperature in Northern Europe, Asia, and
America. It is not reasonable to suppose that the Straits of Behring would have

offered a free passage, either to the River-drift man from Asia to America, or to
American animals from America to Europe, or vice versa, while there was a vast

barrier of ice or of sea, or of both, in the high northern latitudes.
      I therefore feel inclined to view tlie River-drift hunter as having invaded Europe

in pre-glacial times along with the other living species which then appeared. The
evidence, as I have already pointed out, is conclusive that he was also glacial and

post-glacial.

    In all probability the birthplace of man was in a warm if not a tropical region
of Asia, in ' a garden of Eden,' and from this the River-drift man found his way
into those regions where his implements occur. In India he was a member of a

tropical fauna, and his distribution in Europe and along the shores of the Mediter-
ranean prove him to have belonged either to the temperate or the southern fauna

in those regions.

    It will naturally be asked, to what race can the River-diift man be referred ?
604 REPORT-- 1882.

The question, in my opinion, cannot he answered in the present stage of the

inquiry, because tlie few fragments of liuman bones discovered along with the

implements are too imperfect to aftbrd any clue. Nor can we measure the interval

in terms of years wliich separates the River-drift man from the present day, either

by assuming that the glacial period was due to astronomical causes, and then pro-

ceeding to calculate the time necessary for them to produce their result, or by an

appeal to the erosion of vallej's or the retrocession of waterfalls. The interval

must, however, have been very great to allow of the changes in geography and

--climate, and the distribution of animals which has taken place the succession

of races, and the development of civilisation before history began. Standing before

the rock-hewn tombs of the kings at Luxor, we may realise the impossibility of

lixing the time when the River-drift hunter lived on the site of ancient Thebes,

or of measuring the lapse of time between his days and the splendour of the

civilisation of Egypt.

myIn this inquiry, which is all too long, I fear, for  audience, and all too short,

--I know, for my subject, I have purposely omitted all reference to the successor of

the River-drift man iu Europe the Cave man, who was in a higher stage of the

hunter civilisation. In the course of my remarks you will have seen that the

story told by the rudely chipped implements fomid at our very doors in this place,

forms a part of the wider story of the first appearance of man, and of his distribu-

--tion on the earth a story which is to my mind not unfitting fls an introduction to

the work of the Anthropological Section at 'this meeting of the British Association.

Continuing his researches of 1871, the author carried them further by showing

RDthat the termination Nia signifies land or country, leaving the roots, as  (RT,

LD, LT, DR. DL, TR, TL) and BR (BL, RB, LB). These roots are found in the

ancient island names for ' Britannia,' in Brattia, Sardinia, Sardena, Rhodus, Aratus,

Maratha, Kreta (Crete), Cytherea, Hydrrea, Therte, Carthea, Andros, Delos,

^Ethalia (Elba), Telos, Petalia, Mytilene (Lesbos'), Thule, 2 Melita; and for

(Cyprus), Aperopia, Proni, Peparethus, Pylora, Tiparenus, Sapirene, Kephallenia,

Caprese, Ivarpathos. The emblems on the coins of islands, he showed, included the

sun, moon, vase, fish, ship (balsa), being round objects. These emblems also occiu*

on the coins of cities of corresponding name, as Rhodia, Marathus, &c. The roots

RD BRand  were applied to round objects, but only secondaril}' to islands, as they

are primarily applied to mountains (and in a later stage to rivers as taking their

origin in moimtaius). Tables were given of parallel names of mountains, islands,

prevails in Japan, where in a pair the larger island is marked by the male prefix

and the smaller by the female prefix. Mr. Clarke concluded that our islands were

named by the Iberians on a common system of geographical nomenclature, and that

Thule must have been an island known to the earliest Iberian navigators, and was

most likely Iceland. Our islands must have been named iu tlie early epoch of the

foundations of the first empires. This was confirmed by the Celtic names for Hibernia

possible that Albion was another name for Britannia belonging to ihe same class.

   5. Evidence as to ihe Scene of Mans Evolution and the Prospects of
     proving the same hy Faloeontological Discovery. Bi; W. Stewart

      Duncan, M.A.I.

   The object of this paper was to recall attention to a lately neglected department

of anthropology, namely that which concerns itself with the discovery of forms in

fossil proving the evolution of man. It was urged that a committee should be

appointed to investigate this subject specialh', and to report to the Association. In

support of his proposition the author advanced a series of arguments in favour of

the region of the South of Europe and Asia as the probable scene of man's evo-

lution, and as a likely field of successful exploration. This conclusion was reached

as follows :-- On the assumption that man was evolved he must have sprung from

a  small-brained                                                              qnadrumanous semi-erect  creature                                   in that case  he  was evolved

The equal division of the genera of living anthropoid apes between Western

tropical Africa and Indo-Malaya, as also the discovery of fossil anthropoid apes in

the extreme South of France, indicated that living Simiadae were derived from

Southern Asia and Europe. The fairly equal division between tropical Africa and

Malaysia of the lowest types of mankind indicated that they also were derived

from the South of Europe and Asia. But palseontological" evidence existed to

prove that the monkeys and apes of the Old World became dispersed to this very

same I'egion in middle and early tertiary times. Driven thither by increasing cold

-- --from the north- the premonition of a coming ice age they would, if not arrested

have steadily gone on to the equator. But geographical' barriers arrested their

progress for a long period, for the enormous extent of sea-barrier on the northern

Mediterranean shore and on the shore of the Arabian sea and its diverging branches

prevented all but those in South-eastern Asia from finding their way to the tropics.
Those that found their way thither are comparatively unimproved; those that
found their way to Northern Africa by happening to lie near the then probable land

connections (by Italy and Tunis, and by Gibraltar and Tangier) between Europe and

Africa were again arrested by a Sahara sea or desert, and so attained a liigher de-

velopment in the mountainous region of Morocco and Algeria. But those who never

knew of sucli routes, and they must have been the majority, had to remain and contend

with cold, and with their natural enemies among the lower animals. The survivors

of these apes would become adapted to withstand a colder climate, and so would

become fitted to become universally distributed ; increased cold would lessen the

abundance of fruit-trees, woidd necessitate the selection of new kinds of food, would

abolish the habit of living in trees ; the arms would become shorter with less use,

the legs would become more fitted by use to support the body, the foot would

become more adapted for support and less for prehension ; the pelvis and the spine
would assume more of the human characters by the muscular exercise necessitated

by living in a mountainous region, such as this was and still is. The brain would

enlarge as a mere result of the quickening given to it from tlie forces which then
had to he contended with. Implements wherewith to secure food and weapons
to defend life would first be extemporised, then designedly constructed. Caves

would be used, and pit-shelters excavated, and all the marks of developing man
would be evoked. May not those disputed evidences of human handiwork such as
Miocene and Pliocene implements, and cut bones, be the work of pithecoid man ?
At least during later Miocene and Pliocene times such a struggle of surviving apes

would naturally have taken place in this region as a mere result of the climatal and
geographical conditions of that period in Southern Europe and Asia.

     The remains marldng such a struggle ought to he found in part among the
deposits which flank the Eocene-capped mouutams with which this region abounds.
Moreover, these deposits would have been made accessible by having been inclined
by the gradual elevation of these mountains known to have taken place in the
Pliocene and Pliocene epochs. These deposits cannot have been very greatly de-
nuded away, for where glaciation has been greatest deposits of that date are found.
They are therefore likely to be found abundantly elsewhere within this region.

                          By George Harris, LL.D., F.S.A.

     The theory propounded by the writer of this paper is that there is frequently

to be discovered in a succession of persons in the generation of particular families,
an ebb and flow both of mental capacity and moral qualities ; a person of ordinary

endowment having a son of superior power, who has a son of great capacity, by
which he becomes distiijguished and rises in the world, although his own son turns

out to be an individual of capacity below the average.
     The writer referred to the question of the supposed transmission of endowments

acquired by cultivation, and started the inquiry wliether in the cases of trans-
mission of qualities to the ollspring, the intellectual or moral condition of the
parent at the time of the procreation of the child, is that from which the trans-
mission of such qualities is derived.

     The writer also referred to the biographies of distinguished persons, where
accounts are given of the qualities of their progenitors and descendants, as affording

proof of the correctness of his theory.

     The conclusion at which the writer arrived was that there is existent in our
constitution certain operations and impulses analogous to, or corresponding with,
those of tide and reflux, exhaustion and repletion, action and reaction, wearing
out and revivifying, in the material world, e'Ner in process, as regards the origina-
tion, development, and growth of our moral and intellectual endowments, as well
as in the properties of our physical frames, which possess a never-failing influence
in respect to the transmission of these qualities and their manifestation in the ofl-
sprino-, particular endowments going on for generations increasing, until they reach
tlieir climax, when they at once decline.

     In the animal world he pointed out that an analogous growth and decline of

qualities may be observed.
    He also remarked that education and training, to some extent, but only very

partially, can account for the phenomenon in question.

1. On some Ciisioms of tlie Ahorigines of the River Darling, Nexv South
                               Wales. By F. Bonnet.

     The author had resided as one of the early European settlers in the district on
the north side of the River Darling, and had enjoyed unusual opportunities of

learning their habits. In this communication he restricted himself to sundry

customs connected with the more important epochs of life. lie stated that in-

fanticide is frequent, owing to the difficulty of carrying children from place to

place. If, however, the child is not killed (and this is decided directly after birth)

the parents quiclfly become much attached to it, and the children generally are very
Idndly treated. About the age of ten, sundry marks are made in the flesh both of
boys and girls. The former, when about tlie age of sixteen, are initiated into man-
hood by having one front tooth knocked out, or sometimes by some other cere-
monies in place of this. At this time the youth remains apart from the camp, in

companj' with one or two friends, for from ten days to a month, ami for the first
two days is fed only on blood drawn from his friends' arms. The customs of

marriage are described, and their methods of healing the sick. Disease is supposed
to be caused by the incantations of an enemy. The method of performing tliis and
of annulling its eftect were described, and some account given of the prevalent

diseases. The corpse is buried immediately after death, and before entombment is
interrogated as to who caused its end. The direction in which it swings when

struck is supposed to give an answer, and an attempt is made to punish the sup-

Aposed aggressor.  small piece of flesh is usually cut from the corpse, which has

several peculiar uses. The habits of mourning were also described. Tlie paper

was illustrated by numerous photographs taken by the author, and .specimens of

native industry.

in Western China,' by E. Colborne Baker. This contains plates describing a MS.

from Ssu Chuen, obtained from a liill tribe calling itself Lolo. Mr. Clarke bad, at

a previous meeting of the Britisb Association, called attention to a MS. brought

by Captain Gill, R.E., from another tribe of Western China, called Moso. The Lolo

characters Mr. Clarke found to be not the same as the Moso, but having many

resemblances and identities. The Moso contains also many ideographs, and is of the

same nature as the Khita inscriptions from Hamath, Carchemish, Asia Minor, &c.,

and also characters to be found in syllabaries and alphabets throughout the world.

One of the most remarkable circumstances in IjoIo is the many resemblances to the

Vy, or Vei syllabary of Western Africa, supposed to be of modern invention, but

which Mr. Clarke had explained to the British Associatiou to be of ancient material.

Generally speaking the like characters are in different positions in Lolo and Vy,

more peculiar combinations. The Moso has an organisation like the Khita

(Ilittite), the Lolo more like the Vy, but with combinations like the Khita. The

explanation to be assigned is that all the existing syllabaries are derived from an

ancient system, which has been differently developed in various regions, and there

is this remarkable consequence, that the ancient systems are still in operation in

tlie Lolo, the Moso, and the Vy, at the extremities of the Old World, in China and

in Western Africa.

7. On the Formula of Alfred R. Wallace in its relations to Characters and
                      Alphahets. By Hyde Clarke, V.P.A.I.

     Mr. Wallace {Nature, xxiv. p. 244, 1881) called attention to words for mouth

in many languages being labials; for teeth, dentals; and for nose, nasals. This

observation Mr. Clarke extended bj' means of the list he had published of old

Chinese round characters which he had supposed to be derived from the eye.

QTaking the mouth as the pivot, then, (D i" modern Chinese) was the character

for mouth, eye, ear, head, face, sun, moon, mother, woman, egg, flower, field or

enclosm-e, doorway, ring, blood, pot, white, four. In Chinese several of tliese are

still labials in M, and so they are in English. Mr. Clarke had shown that in many

-- Qlanguages these words are allied in sound, and are labials characters include d и

Where, however, the idea of eating, &c. is introduced, a dental may displace a

labial in the word for mouth ; and so other words are liable to be displaced by other

ideas and sounds. The nasal roots Mr. Clarke found to belong to the series he had

already demonstrated in Chinese as the + series. As the labials are female, so are

the nasals male ; and the charactei-s appertaining include + + T                                                                                                                                                                            -I-    -^ N, &c.

Mr. Clarke has found that the dental series embraces such ideas as tooth, hill,

AAA.island, door, drum, arrowhead, with the characters A, A.                                                                                                                                                                                The result is

that speech-language was founded on the ideas of gesture- or sign-language, and

that characters, according to the observations of Colonel Mallery and Mr. Clarke, are

applicable not only to speech-language but to gesture-language. Mr. Clarke there-

fore considers that characters were more ancient than speech, and that speech was

propagated in the Old and New World by a race of high culture, most probably white.

The consequence is that all languages in the world are found to be connected, and

to have many resemblances of sound                                                                                                                                                                           but the  general connection is psychological,
                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

a connection of ideas and not of sounds. In this sense, all language is of common

origin, but no one primeval language ever existed. The communitv of .sound depends

on the application of labials, nasals, and dentals to associated ideas, but differen-

tiality begins with the selection of the labial, &c. As selection took place of the

various ideas, so did the substitution of other sounds take place. On applying the

test of the primary characters to ancient characters, syllabaries, and alphabets, it

was shown that as a general law those which should be labials were of the labial

form, and so of the others. Thus Korean was found strictly to correspond, although

apparently artificial, and Vei, supposed to be of modern invention, proved to be

ancient in its elements. Mr. Clarke considered that the trine law in grammar may

have been developed on the system of 3 sounds, as 3 parts of speech ; 3 divisions
of each ; 3 numbers, 3 cases, 3 degrees, 3 persons, 3 forms of verbs, 3 moods,

3 tenses, 3 positions of adverbs, kc.

          8. The City of the Tarquins. By Misa A, W. Buckland.

     In describing a short visit paid two years ago to Corneto, the modern representative
of old Tarquinii and to the Necropolis of the ancient city, Miss Buckland points out

how few travellers forsake the heaten track to investigate the relics of a people
anterior to the Romans and their instructors in most of the arts, as well as their
teachers in religious rites and divination. Yet these people have left hehind them

innumerable works of surpassing interest, showing an affinity with those of Egypt,
Assyria, and Greece, yet bearing a distinctive character of their own. The legends
of this ancient people make them a colony of Lydians, driven by famine from their

own land and settling among the prior inhabitants of Italy, who were probably an

admixture of Umbrians and Pelasgians, or as some prefer to call them, Tirrhenians,
although tliis name is also applied to the Etruscans.

     This Lydian colony, led by Tarchon, the companion of ^neas, landing probably

at Civita Vecchia, founded Tarquinii, so called from Tarchon, of whom the legend

further relates, that ploughing on what is now the Necropolis, a boy, named Tages,

with grey hair, sprang up under his plough. Tages instructed the Etruscans in
religion and the arts of government ; and Miss Buckland looks upon this grey-

haired boy as a personification of the former inhabitants, from whom the Etruscans

adopted much, and points out that the jewellery formerly ascribed to the Etruscans
is assigned by Castellani to this former race, whilst the well-known vases are of
Greek origin, the manufacture having been introduced from Corinth by Demaratus,
the father of Tarquinius Priscus. The earlier Etruscan ware is black and unpainted,
but sometimes ornamented with raised figures. The Etruscans were most famous
for their works in bronze, which seem to have been exported to all parts of Europe,
and they probably obtained the tin necessary for the manufacture from Britain,
since articles found in the tombs show a very extensive commerce.

     The tombs of Tarquinii differed much from those of the Romans, being subter-

 ranean and very elaborately painted ; there are facsimiles of some of these paintings
in the British Museum, but fresh discoveries (ire constantly made, as the Necropolis

is now being excavated by the Italian Government. Besides the painted tombs the
Necropolis of Tarquinii contains many fine tumuli, resembling those in our own
land, and Miss Buckland suggests that antiquaries might find much of interest in

 excavating these, as also the site of the ruined and utterly forsaken city of Tarquinii.
 where possibly a clue to the Etruscan language, so long sought in vain, might be

 discovered.

     Among the interesting objects from the Necropolis, now collected in a newly
 formed museum at Corneto, Miss Buckland mentioned several situlse, which are

 dressing cases of bronze, elaborately ornamented, containing all the necessaries of a
 lady's toilet ; several beautiful vases and dishes of glass, resembling the Phoenician,

 two sets of false teeth, fastened together with flattened gold wire, and a large
 number of mirrors and vases ; also sarcophagi and cists, beautifully sculptured in

 relief and painted. The tomb-paintings show that women in Etruria were treated

 as equal to men, enjoying the same rights and privileges, descent being traced
 through the mother, which probably shows that the Etruscans were a non-Aryan
 race, although their origin is not yet determined. They have disappeared from
 history, leaving oul}' their sepulchres, works of art, and great engineering works,
 particularly in drainage and subterranean aqueducts, to the ruin of which Miss

 Buckland ascribes much of the increased unhealthiness of the Maremma and

 Campagna.

9. The Influence of the Intellectual Faculties in relation to the Direction

      and Operation of the Material Organs. By George Hakris, LL.D.,

        F.S.A.

The object of the writer of this paper is to point out the extent to which, and

the mode in which, the discipline and cultivation of the material voluntary organs,

including more especially the senses and the hand, may be affected by the "operation

1882.  BB
610 EEPORT-- 1882.

of the mind upon them, so that by the training of the latter the complete and

systematic regulation of the former may be accomplished. He observed that in
many of our mental operations, where a corporeal organ is resorted to, it occa-

sionally appears difficult to determine whether the mind, or the material organ, is
that which is mainly employed.

    By the cultivation of the senses it is that the acuteness and the susceptibility of

the organ to perceive, not the power of the mind to receive impressions from the
sense, are enlarged. It is in fact altogether an animal or material improvement
that takes place, and through which we obtain a considerable share of that power
with which animals are so extensively endowed, particularly in those sensations,
such as feeling and touching, and smelling and tasting, which peculiarly appertain
to the animal part of our nature.

     Thus also the hand, by cultivation, acquires dexterity, quite independent of the

improved skill of the mind to direct it ; which in its turn may be, in many cases,

also improved both in its actual power and in its ability to receive impulses from
the senses. The writer alluded to the various employments of the hand as the organ
of the mind, in playing on a musical instrument, in mechanical operations, and in

drawing. And he pointed out the necessity, in order to carry out to perfection the

maintenance of this communication between the mind and the material organs of
each kind, of both the intellectual faculties and the organs to be disciplined to
their rule obtaining a thorough and systematic cultivation. The mind itself, he
asserted, is never liable to fatigue, although the material organs on which the miud
acts suffer from constraint in their operation when impelled so as to incur this,
by the influence of the mind. The left hand is unable to act as efficiently as the
right as an organ of the mind, simply from the general neglect to discipline it.
The discipline and training of each of the organs is best and most efficiently
acquired during youth ; while the importance of the acquisition it is impossible to

over-estimate.

1. The Arctic Campaign of 1882. Its Origin, Constitution, and Objects.

                By Lieutenant G. T. Temple, B.N., F.E.G.S.

     After referring to the revival of public interest in Polar research which has taken
place of late years. Lieutenant Temple gave a slight sketch of the salient features

of Arctic discovery during the middle ages, showing how the quaint fancies of the

early philosophers gradually gave place to the intensely practical investigations of

modern times. He said that the great value and importance of scientific inquiry

in the Arctic regions had long since been acknowledged, and that special attention
had been paid to it by all the more recent Arctic expeditions. But, while important
results in various departments of science had consequently been obtained, they had
hitherto been too isolated and scattered to admit of comprehensive generalisation.
To remedy this state of things, Lieutenant Weyprecht and Count Wilczec had
taken energetic measures to rouse public interest in a scheme of international co-
operation, the details of which were finally agreed upon at the Polar Conference
held at St. Petersburg in July 1881 , amongst them being the establishment of four-

--teen stations twelve in the Arctic, and two in the Antarctic regions. Lieutenant

Temple then gave some details of the nature, period, and frequency of the ob-
 servations to be made, and stated that England would co-operate with the Polar
 Commission by watching the general meteorology of the North Atlantic. Re-
 ferring to the circular issued last spring by the Meteorological Council, he said it
 might be confidently expected that shipowners and officers would render cordial

 assistance in furthering an inquiry in which they were so deeply !interested. He

 thought that, considering the enormous amount of labour which would be re-
 quired to tabulate and reduce for comparison the mass of material which is almost
 sure to be forthcoming, it would be admitted that England took a prominent part
 in the campaign, in thus supplementing the work of the fixed stations, while the
 patriotism and enterprise displayed by the Meteorological Office reflected credit on

 the whole nation.

      With regard to the purely geographical part of the campaign. Lieutenant Hov-
 gaard's spirited enterprise, of which a detailed account was given, was a good illus-

  tration of the fact that, though the area of the iinknown region has been greatly
  reduced during the present century, there is still ample scope for ingenious specula-
  tion as to the distribution of land and water about the Pole. Lieutenant Temple
  then gave some particulars of the American, Dutch, and other exploring expeditions
  of the year, with an outline of the sad story of the Jeannette, and a sketch of the

 measures taken for the relief of Mr. Leigh Smith. He paid a warm tribute to the
  devotion and heroism of the officers and men of the Jeannette, and said that they
 could not have won for themselves a more imperishable name, even if they had

  succeeded in reaching the Pole. In conclusion, he remarked that the Arctic cam-
  paign of 1882 marked a fresh point of departure in Polar investigation, which

  might now be considered as an accepted branch of study, and there could be little
  doubt that the whole physical economy of the Polar regions would, sooner or later,
  be brought to light. The one thing necessary to ensure success was continuity of

effort.

 2. Notes on a visit to the ChuJccJd Peninsula in 1881, based on letters
     from Drs. Arthur and Attrel Krause. Communicated bij the Bremer*
       Geographical Society.

     The brothers Krause, who were sent by the Bremen Geographical Society for

 the purpose of making scientific observations in Bering's Strait, landed in Lawrence
 Bay in August 1881, and visited twelve diff"erent localities before the middle of
 September, from Plover Bay in the south, to Uddle, just within the Arctic circle.
 This, the largest village met with, is on the northern side of East Cape, with
eighty-three huts and some 2G0 inhabitants. The travellers made considerable
collections of plants, obtained many objects of ethnological interest, took dredgings
 and soundings, and made rapid surveys of various parts as yet imperfectly repre-

 sented in charts.

     The Chiikchis were found to be much reduced in numbers by famine, partly
caused by their parting with necessary fur clothing for drink, and partly by whales
and walruses being driven from their coasts. The division of this tribe into two

classes, distinguished by their habits of hunting marine or land animals, is found to
be imaginary, as members of the same family are found in both of them, and their
languages do not differ. Tattooing is universal among their women, and their

clothing in general resembles that of the Eskimo, with whom they retain com-

mercial relations. Here and there along the coast small communities also were
found, differing completely in language, and to some extent in features, from the
other Chukchis, and indicating a relationship with the Greenland Eskimo.

   --The region examined was divisible into three well-marked classes: 1, a stony

or licheniferous tundra ; 2, a wet-moss tundra ; 3, slopes and valleys with com-

paratively luxui'iant vegetation, the willows attaining a height of three feet. Of
land mammals only Siberian marmot and the whistling hare {Lagomys hyper-
boreus) were met with ; but according to the natives, wild reindeer, mountain
sheep, foxes, bears, and wolves occasionally make their appearance on the coast.

     The travellers returned to San Francisco early in November, and afterwards
passed the winter in Alaska, where one of them remains, with the object of
examining the basin of the Yukon river.

3. The question of an Overland Boute to China from India via Assam, with

     some remarhs on the source of the Irrawaddi River. By Chaeles H.

      Lepper, F.B.G.S., M.B.A.S.

     The author traced a short history of the little already done to solve the important
problem indicated by the title, and showed that there is steam-transit all the way from
Europe to our extreme north-eastern frontier outpost nearest to China, viz. Makum,
and that there is no physical objection against continuing the railway now in progress

of construction to Makum from that outpost all the way to the banks of the Irra-
waddi river. He pointed out that the inhabitants of the country through which

this extension of the railway would have to pass are Singphos, who are very

friendly to the English, and are quite independent of the Burmese, and also of the
Chinese. These Singphos have further expressed a wish that a road should be

made through their country, as they are alive to the advantages they would reap

from it. Mr. Lepper then explained that Chinese traders already visit and settle
amongst these Singphos, on this independent, or as he calls it ' neutral ground,'

and that were a road or railway continued from Makum to the Irrawaddi, a dis-

tance of only about 120 miles, there can be little doubt the adventurous Chinese

traders who now traffic on the Irrawaddi would be induced to come to us for

British merchandise. Thus the whole of Western China would be thrown open to
British commerce, without the necessity of any treaty with China, and without

any European having to cross the Chinese frontier. Further, the Thibetans, who

already trade in this western part of China, would avail themselves of these Chinese

traders as intermediaries between themselves and us, and in this way Eastern
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  613

Thibet would also be opened to British commerce, and English goods would take
the place of Russian goods, which latter now almost exclusively represent Euro-
pean markets in "Western China and Eastern Thibet. With steam-transit all the

way from Europe to the banks of the Irrawaddi, at the latitude mentioned there

could be little doubt that the question of the best route from India to China over-
land would be solved, as the road would nowhere enter or be subject to the
King of Burma's dominions, and thus our goods would be landed without dues or

* squeezes ' at the very frontier of China, practically speaking.

     Mr. Lepper pointed out that notwithstanding the new era which is sure to

-- --open for tbis frontier once the railway to Makum is opened next year nothing

is being done to prepare for the new order of things, and that there is not a single
European who can speak the Singpho language, or who knows the prejudices,

manners, and customs of the Singphos, although Makum itself is situated among

Singpho villages, which are scattered about and within our frontier in this direc-

tion. He then explained the advantages which would be derived on the opening

of this route by British merchants, owners of tea properties in Assam, the Public
Works Department of Assam, and last, but not least, by Bengal in its times of

famine. Mr. Lepper then called attention to certain data he had collected, which
went to show that the Irrawaddi could not take its rise much further north than

latitude 28░ 30'.

4. Notes on the oldest Records of the Sea-Boute to China from Western

  --Asia. By Colonel H. Yule, C.B., E.E. See Reports, p. 347.

                               FRIDAY, AUGUST 25.

     The Peesibent delivered the following Address :

                                   The Central Plateau of Asia.

     The subject chosen for this address is the Plateau of mid-Asia. This area, which
is one of the most wonderful on the surface of the earth, contains nearly 3,000,000
English square miles, and is equal to three-fourths of Europe. Its limits, its
exterior configuration, its central and commanding situation in the Asiatic con-
tinent, will be clearly perceived from the large diagram of Asia which is exhibited
here.' As compared with soraeof the more favoured regions, it is singularly desti-
tute of natural advantages. Though it has several deep depressions of surface, yet
its general elevation is very considerable, and some of its large districts are the
most elevated in the globe. It is walled in from the outer world and excluded
from the benign influences of the sea by momitain chains. Its climate then is A'ery
severe on tlie whole, more distinguished for cold than for heat, but often displaying
extremes of temperature high as well as low. It offers, from the character of its
contour, extraordinary obstacles to communication by land or water. Though
seldom inaccessible to courageous explorers, it is generally hard of access, and in
several respects very inhospitable. In the progress of civilisation it is, with reference
to its liistoric past, excessively backward. Its capacities for the production of
wealth have been but httle developed. Its population is scanty, scattered, and for
the most part uncultured. Its agriculture comprises only a i&vf areas widely segre-
gated from each other, and many of its largest districts are amazingly desolate.

     Nevertheless this plateau has eminent claims on the attention of geographers,

for several reasons which may be summarised thus :

   A1 . mountain system which dominates the greater part of Asia, and includes

stupendous ranges with the loftiest peaks yet discovered in the world.

     ' See an able disquisition on this subject in ' The Himalaj-a System,' by Trelawny

Saunders, Geographer of the India Office, to whom I am much indebted for suggestiona

regarding the plateau.
614 KEPOBT-- 1882.

    A2. series of lieiglits and depressions almost like the steps of a staircase witliin

 the mountainous circumvallation of the plateau.
      3. The sources and the permanent supply of rivers -which, passing from the

 plateau, flow through densely populated regions, and help to sustain the most

 numerous families of the human race.

     A4. lacustrine system, comprising lakes of which some are saline while others

 have fresh water, aud of which many are situated at great altitudes.
      5. The home of conquering races, whence warrior hordes poured during several

 centuries over nearly all Asia and a large part of Europe.
       6. Natural products of value, variety, or interest, and pastoral resources suscep-

 tihle of indefinite development.

     7. An enormous field for scientific research, with many regions which, though

 not wholly undiscovered, yet need much further discovery.

     An8. imperial jurisdiction otfering many problems for the consideration of

  social inquirers.

      I shall now oflier a brief explanation regarding each of the eight points stated

  above.

       In the first place it will be seen from the diagi-am that the plateau, in shape
  somewhat of an irregular rhomboid, is completel}' enclosed by six grand ranges of
  mountains, namely the Himalayas looking south towards India, the Pamir looking
  west towards Central Asia, the Altai looking north towards Siberia, the Yablonoi
  looking north-enst towards Eastern Siberia, the Yun-ling and the Inshan (inclusive
  of the Khingan), looking towards China. These several ranges preserve generally a
  considerable altitude varying from 6,000 to 25,000 feet above sea-level, and reaching
' in the Himalayas to more than 29,000 feet. The tallest of these summits have
  been accurately measured by tiie Great Trigonometrical Survey of India. Their
  altitude is about double that of the highest mountains in Europe, and surpasses any
  altitude yet observed in any quarter of the globe. But as a great part of these
  several ranges is as yet unsurveyed by trigonometry, it is possible that still greater

  heights may be discovered, and that ' Excelsior ' may be the proud answer rendered
  by the everlasting hills to human investigation.

        Kegardiug these and the other chains yet to be mentioned, it must be borne in

  mind that there are many cross ranges and transverse lines of mountains. Even the
  chains, too, often consist of detached groups separated by deep valleys. It is by

   observing the position of the groups relatively to one another that the tendency of
   the chain can be discerned.

        Such being the outer barriers of our plateau, there are within it two great ranges
   mainly parallel and running from west to east, namely the Kuen-lun and the Thian
   Shan.

        While the Ilimalaj^as form the southern flank of the great Tibetan upland,
   the Kuen-lun constitutes the northern. The modicum of knowledge possessed by
   us regarding the Kuen-lun, a most important factor in the geography of our
   plateau, is largely due to the praiseworthy travels of the Russian Prejevalsky.

   This range may be said in a certain sense to overlook the Tarim basin ending in

   Lake Lob, though the mountains are actually distant more than a hundred miles
   from that lake. It forms the southern boundary of the Tarim basin, which coatains
   some of the few beautiful tracts in our plateau. If there be such a thing as a back-
   bone to these regions, or anything like a dorsal ridge, it consists of the Kuen-lun.

        The Thian Shan starts from the Pamir, and runs westward for full 1,500 miles,
   till it joins with some of its spurs the uplands of Mongolia proper, or touches with
   others the dreary desert of Gobi. As the Kuen-lun forms the southern boundary
    of the Tarim basin, so the Thian Shan constitutes the northern.

         Connected with the north-western part of the Himalayas is another range which
   some regard as an oftshoot, but which others treat separately under the name of
    Karalcuram. Together with the Himalayas it joins the Pamir.

         Thus three of the greatest mountain ranges in Asia converge upon the Pamir,
    or according to some are there interlaced ; namely the Himalayas, the Kuen-lun,
    and the Thian Shan, to which perhaps two others might be added, namely th^
   Karakuram just mentioned and the Altai. But it may be more accurately said
                                                  TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  615

that the outer border of our plateau north of the Pamir is formed by the terminal

spurs of the Thian Shan. It is to be remembered also that the Indian Caucasus

which does not concern our plateau directly enough to fall within this address

probably joins the Pamir. In general terms, the convergence of mountain ranges

on the Pamir renders it geographical]}' the most important position in Asia. The

uniustructed iVsiatics have evinced a hazy admiration of its grandeur by calling it

' the roof of the world.' The comparatively instructed Europeans have revered it

as the soiu'ce of the classic O.xus and as fraught with political considerations. Un-
less further discoveries shall alter existing information, we may expect that com-

pletely informed geographers will consider that this Pamir is the mother of

mountains, that other ranges are to it as the branches are to the root, and that here

if anywhere is the true boss of the Asiatic shield.

In the second place, the vast surface of our plateau, though almost uninter-

ruptedly environed by its rocky walls, presents an extraordinary series of elevations

and depressions. In the heart of the plateau there is the depression known to

geographers as the Western Gobi, sometimes called the Tarim basin. Within this

there is the Lob Lake or Lob Nor, truly an inland sea into which the waters of

several rivers ultimatelj- flow, finding no vent towards the ocean. The total length

of the Tarim river, with its affluents debouching into Lob Nor, cannot be less than

800 miles. This curious and interesting lake is not more than 2,000 feet above

sea-level, and forms almost the lowest dip in our plateau. It is like the bottom of

a vast platter, or the centre in the hollow of a mighty hand. Around this de-

pression there are on all sides uplands of various heights like gradations in the Asiatic

terrace terminating in the intermediate ranges, or in the outer circumvallation of

mountains already described. On the east of it there is the tract called Eastern

Gobi, chiefly desert, and Mongolia, averaging 4,000 feet above sea-level : on the

north the Altai uplands, exceeding 5,000 feet. On the west the Pamir rises

abruptly, exceeding 13,000 feet ; on the south Tibet, with eqiual abruptness, having

an aAerage altitude of 15,000 feet above sea-level, thus being the loftiest expanse in

the world                                         and on the south-east the tract around the Kuku Nor Lake, 10,000 feet.
                                               ;

Further, there is a detached depression known as the Zungarian strait, extend-

ing to the northern confine of our plateau between the Thian Shan and the Altai

ranges. This strait, hardly exceeding 2,000 feet above sea-level, is as low as,

perhaps even lower than, any part of oar plateau, and is very near brealring its

continuity, which may be considered as being just saved b}' the comparatively

humble altitude above mentioned. The depression is geographically important as

forming the only broad pass between our plateau and the world without. It

runs from Mongolia, the most important tract within our plateau, to Siberia out-

side. Great value was, in early times, attached by the Chinese to it, as being the

only natural highway on a large scale between Northern and Central Asia.

The e.xistence of this and the other depressions above described has led to

interesting speculations among geologists as to there having been, in primeval times,

within our plateau, at least one inland sea as large as the Mediterranean of Europe.

Be tliat as it may, there is no doubt that a process of desiccation has been going

on within our plateau during historic ages, whereby the climate is considerably

affected, and many signs or evidences show that this process is still in operation.

On most of its sides our plateau is extraordinarily inaccessible, the passes being

steep in the extreme, and on the south ending in ridges 18,000 to 20,000 feet above

sea- level. Towards Siberia the Altai passes are easier, and on the north-east be-

tween Mongolia and China there are several passes that have witnessed the historic

outpourings of the Mongol hordes, and which are ominously remembered by the

Chinese as the openings through which their invaders rushed like the great river

in flood, or the landslip from the mountain side, or the avalanche sweeping along

the boulders and debris to the destruction of the valleys beneath.

     The great desert of Eastern Gobi occupies the eastern portion of our plateau.
With its accumulating forces of sand and powdered earth it has a tendency to

encroach, and is regarded by man with a vague awe. Its present extent is

enormous, being not less than half a million of square miles. Nor does it exist

alone within our plateau, for between the Tarim basin and the Kuen-lun spurs there
616 REPOET-- 1882.

is a lesser desert called Takla-makan with 100,000 square miles of area. It may

probably be found that these two deserts join or are otherwise connected.
    In the third place we have noted that while the prevaUiug characteristics of our

plateau are wildness, ruggedness, or desolation, yet within it are the sources of
several great rivers which sustain the most teeming peoples on the face of the

earth. The monarch as it were of aU these noble waters is the Yang-tse-Kiang.
Though its head streams have been but imperfectly explored, yet its true source is
known to be in the Kuen-lun mountains already mentioned. After quitting our
plateau and passing out of its prison-house in the mountains through natural gates
of the utmost magnificence, it permeates the most thickly-peopled provinces of

--China provinces inhabited by about 120 millions of souls. It sustains the life of

this enormous population by supplying the necessary moisture and by affording the

means of irrigation and of water-traffic. No river has ever in ancient or modern
times played so important a part in the increase of the human race as the Yang-

tse-Kiang. Its supply of water is immense and unfailing, and this most essential
characteristic is caused by its connection with the snow-clad and ice-bound regions
of our plateau, within which it has a course of 700 miles before entering China proper.
 Amidst the same Kueu-lun range, the Iloang-ho rises, from imexplored springs,
 which the Chinese figure to themselves as ' the starry sea.' After burstmg through
several ranges, making wondrous bends fi'om its main direction near the base
 of our plateau, and changing its course more than once to the confusion of com-
 parative geography, it tra^"erses Northern China and confers agricultural prosperity
 on some 70,000,000 of souls. It also has a course of some 400 miles within our
 plateau, in consequence of which its water-supply is perennially snow-fed. Again,
 the Irrawaddi and the Mekhong, the former watering Burma and the latter watering
 Cambodia, rise in the oflshoots of the Kuen-lun. That region, then, in respect of

 the parentage of important rivers, stands in the first rank. This beneficent circum-
 stance arises from the direction of subsidiary ranges which admit to this part of
 our plateau some of the moisture-laden breezes from the Pacific Ocean.

       Similarly the two Indian rivers, the Brahmaputra, and the Indus with its
 affluent the Sutlej, have their origin at a great distance within our plateau, and
 their water-supply is indefinitely augmented iu consequence. Notwithstanding the
 vast volume of their waters, these rivers play an economic part which, though
 great, is much less than that of the main Chinese rivers. The IBrahmaputra, above
  its lower course as the Megna, cannot be said to sustain more than 1.5,000,000

 of people; and the Indus, together with the Sutlej, may support 12,000,000.
 The Ganges and Jumna, issuing from masses of snow on the southern scarp of

  our plateau, sustain before their junction at Allahabad a population of 30,000,000

 --quite irrespective of the deltaic population of the lower Ganges, for whom

  moisture is supplied from other sources. Of these Indian rivers the waters, per-
  petually snow-fed, are largely drawn away for canals of irrigation on a grand
  scale. Taken all in all, despite defects, the Ganges Canal is the most imposing

  example of hydraulic engineering that has yet been seen. From the glaciers of the

  Pamir and the western terminus of the Thian Shan there spring the head-streams
  of the Oxus, the Jaxartes, and tlieir branches, ending iu the inland sea of Aral. To
  these, in Persian phrase, the epithet of ' gold-scatterer' or ' wealth dispenser' is
  felicitously^ applied by the natives.

      Of the rivers rising in the northern section of our plateau, the Amur has possi-

  bilities of which the future may see the development. But the great rivers of

  Siberia, such as the Obe, the Yenisei, and the Lena, though flowing through rich
  soils and aflbrding marvellous facilities for several systems of inland navigation to
   be connected with each other, yet have their long estuaries in the permanently
  frost-bound lands of the Tundra, and their mouths in the Arctic waters frozen
  during most months of the year. Therefore they can never, in economic importance,
   vie with the rivers above mentioned, which flow into the Pacific and Indian Oceans.

        In the fourth place, the lacustrine system, though not comparable to that of
  North America or of Central Africa, and not approaching in beauty or interest that
   of Southern Europe, is yet very considerable. It is not, however, the only one iu
  Asia, and from it must be excluded the three great Siberian lakes of Issykkul, of
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  617

Baikal, and of Balkasb, which, though connected with our plateau, are beyond its
actual limits. Exclusive of these, however, the lakes, great and small, within our

plateau, are extraordinarily numerous. Not less than a hundred of them may be
counted on the maps of this region. Of these lakes, however, some are insignificant,

being little more than saline swamps. Others, again, as the Pangong, though

--romantically beautiful reposing at an altitude equal to that of the highest
--European, mountains, and reflecting the perennial snow of surrounding peaks do

not illustrate specially any geographical prol)lem or produce any economic

result. But some may be selected as having a scientific interest irrespective of

beauty or of strangeness.

    The Lake Victoria, discovered by Wood in 1838, rests in the heart of the Pamir,

already mentioned, at an elevation of 15,000 feet above .sea-level. It is frozen over
during the greater part of the year, and lies with a glistening and polished surface

in the midst of a snow-whitened waste. In that state it powerfully affects the

imagination of the spectator who reaches it as the final goal, after a protracted and

toilsome ascent from the barren or deserted plains of Ariana. It is the source of
the Oxus, and is near the point of contact between the British and the Russian

political systems in Asia.

     In the sharpest contrast to the highly-placed Pamir lake is the lowly Lake Lob,

already mentioned. Shallow water, sedgy morass, dreary sands, parched forests

--the monotony of desolation are reported to be its characteristics. It apparently

consists of the dregs of an inland sea that is mostly dried up, and is, as it
were, kept alive only by the Tarim river, which has its sources in the everlasting
snows of the Pamir. Despite the proximity of saline tracts, the lake has fresh

water. Near it is a great desert, of which the soil, though now arid and friable,
owing to the gradual desiccation, was once more or less productive, and where a

population has probably become extinct or has disappeared by migration.
     The Pamir then is a water-parting for two inland seas, one the Aral, beyond

--our plateau, the other Lob Nor within it both saved from speedy desiccation only

by the influx of rivers from the snow-line.

     Again in contrast is the Kuku Nor, a sheet of water 10,000 feet above sea- level,

in the eastern section of the Kuen-lim mountains, near the source of the Hoang-ho.
Its waters, profound and saline, have a dark azure hue, which is compared by the
natives to that of the exquisite silks in Clhina. It is in the Tangut region, men-
tioned by Marco Polo in his Itinerary. In respect to the lakes in this region, and
especially the morasses of Tsaidam, there are geological speculations as to another
Asiatic Mediterranean (besides that already mentioned), long since dried up, where-

of there are a few widely-scattered remnants, among which the Kuku Nor is one.
     Lastly, a word of passing notice may be devoted to two among the Tibetan

lakes, that of Tengri, near Lhassa, on the shore of which stands a venerated
Buddhist convent, and the Bul-tso, from which have been obtained quantities of the

best borax.

     In the fifth place, the north-eastern part of our plateau was during remote ages,

beyond the ken of history, the home of hardy and aggressive Tartars, or, as they may
be more properly called, Mongols. These Tartar races, dwelling among the uplands
in the lee of the mountains, used for many centuries to emerge and harry the fertile
Chinese plains lying between the mountains and the Pacific Ocean. It was to ward

oft' these incursions that the Great Wall was constructed, winding like a vast serpent

of stone along the ridges of mountains for 2,000 miles from the Pacific coast to

the Siberian confines. The cost and labour expended on this amazing work attest
the dread with which the Tartar highlanders had inspired the Chinese lowlanders.
Some centuries after the building of the AVall, the most warlike among the Tartar
tribes, in the council of their national assembly, acclaimed Temujin as their king, in

the year 1206 A.D. He took a title which is translated by Europeans asChinghiz

Khan, a title which for two centuries or more was the best known name in the whole
world. At the head of his Tartar adherents, he first subdued the other kindred
tribes of our plateau. Then he organised and disciplined the whole Tartar man-
hood into an army of horsemen. This is the most wonderful instance of military
mobilisation known to history ancient or modern. Its results too were equally ap-

pallinp;. In medieval times the marches of the A.rabs and the Saracens, in modern

times the expeditions of Napoleon, have dazzled Asia or Europe. These were

hardly, however, equal to the distant conquests of Alexander the Great in ancient

times. But even the wars of Alexander were perhaps surpassed by the ravao;e3 of
Chinghiz Khan and the Tartars of our plateau. The countries of China, India,

Afghanistan, Bactria, Persia, the Aral-Caspian basin, Siberia, Asia Minor, Russia,

were overrun within a hundred j'ears by Chinghiz Khan, his lieutenants, and his

immediate descendants. Thus, through the hordes of our plateau there was estab-

lished a dominion stretching from Cape Comorin, near the equator, to the Arctic

Ocean, and from the Pacific shores to the banks of the Vistula in Poland. The

latest historian of the Mongols considers that nothing but the unexpected death of

the Tartar sovereign, and the poUtical combinations arising in consequence within

this very plateau of ours, prevented the Tartar invasion from spreading even to
"Western Europe. Though it is often held that these terrific events have been over-

ruled by Providence for the progress of mankind, still at the time they caused what

Gibbon truly calls a shipwreck of nations. Notwithstanding this, the Tartars

won, in a certain sense, an unparalleled success, which is attributable to the

geographical circumstances of our plateau.

     The influence of the precipices, the forests, the prairies, the wild sports, in

Weforming the national character is so obvious that it need not be specified.

readily understand how the sturdy mountaineer, the daring hunter, the practised

archer, becomes the able soldier. In Mongolia, however, the local speciality was

this, that the practically boundless extent of the pasturage and the nutritious rich-

ness of its quality, induced the ]Deople to maintain countless horses, cows, bufl'aloes,

sheep, goats, and camels, neglecting the tillage of the soil, never building houses,

but living in tents made of warm felt, accumulating a rude wealth, still ro\'ing

and roaming about at some seasons incessantly from one encampment or one

grazing-ground to another, dragging with them their families and their efiects

by means of the pack animals and the roomy waggons drawn by many oxen yoked

abreast. Thus was a truly nomadic existence practised on the largest scale ever

known. Mongol armies, better drilled, armed, accoutred, and equipped than any

forces then known in the civilised world, would emerge from our plateau into the

inhabited plains around, and would observe houses and towns for the first time. It

is even alleged that some of them had never seen cultivated ci'ops before.

In this state of existence the temptations to depredation of all sorts were

excessive, and the danger from the climate, the savagery of nature, and the wild

beasts, was always imminent. Consequently the Mongols were obliged to hold

themselves together by the cohesion of families, clans, and tribes. Thus by the

force of circumstances a social organisation was established which proved the foun-

dation of a military discipline suitable to the genius of the people, almost self-acting,

and unfailing even in the remotest expeditions. The horses, too, upon which the

Mongol warriors mainly depended, naturally fell into the training ; being always

turned out to graze in herds, they habitually kept together, and the field manoeuvres

fixed habits which had been already acquired. It used to be remarked that a line

of Mongol cavalry was Uke a rope or a chain, perfectly flexible but never parted.

The Mongolian food included little of cereals or vegetables, but consisted mainly

of cheese and meat. For stimulating drink there was the fermented mare's milk.

The name ' koumis ' or ' prepared milk,' apparently much esteemed medically now-

a-days, is a Mongolian word. Manifestly, men thus nurtured coidd live in the

saddle day and night, carrying with them their sustenance in the smallest compass,

and scarcely halting to eat or drink. Thus the hardihood evinced on protracted

marches, which would otherwise be incredible, can be accounted for.

It is probable that this diet while sustaining vivacity produced also a violence

of disposition. CertaLaly, ruthlessness, cruelty, indifference to suffering characterised

the Mongols and marred the eflect of their grand qualities. Massacres, holocausts,

conflagrations marked their warlike operations. Even famines and epidemics have

Ahardly done more for depopulation than the Mongol conquests.        Mongolian

chief would say that the keenest enjoyment in life was to stamp upon a beaten

enemy, to seize his family, and despoU his encampment.
                            IBANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.                      619

It is not the purpose of this address to describe the policy of the Mongols or the
Ainstitutions which they founded in conquered countries.
                                                          few salient points only

have been indicated in reference to the geography of our plateau. It is here, near

what is now known as the upper region of the Amur, that the Onon, the Orkhou,

and the Kerulen, classic streams in Mongol story, take their source. Here is the

site of Kara Koron, the emperor's head-quarter encampment. Here the Kurultai

assemblies were held to decide the fate of nationalities. Here were the camps, the

Urta, and Urdus, rude names at first unpronounceable in the civilised world, but

soon to become terribly familiar. Here were the hordes mustered under their

banners, each standard having its distinctive colour, the supreme ensign being,

however, the yak's tail raised aloft. Hither, also, the corpse of Chinghiz Khan was

borne in a cumbrous catafalque, dragged through the deep loam by oxeii \oked

twenty abreast, while his henchmen chanted a dirge which was a pathetic eti'usion

from the heart of a valiant nation, and was full of poetic images drawn i'rom the

Mongolian surroundings.

In the sixtli place, though our plateau has possessed, and still possesses, some

patches of fine cultivation, such as those in the Upper Tarim basin, near Yarkand

and Kashgar, and some near Lhassa in Tibet, still it has comparatively but little of

agriculture, of trade, or of industry. Nevertheless it has many natural resources of

value and interest, while its pastoral resources have proved astonishing. Its breed

of horses, though by no means the finest, has yet been quite the largest ever

known. These horses have never displayed the beauty of the Arabian or the

size of the Turkomau breed. They are middle-sized, and do not attain the

speed of thorouglibreds. liut in nimbleness amidst rugged ground, in endurance

over lengthened distances, and in preserving their condition with scanty nourish-

ment, they are unrivalled. 1'heir numbers too may well exercise the imagina-

tion of modern breeders. For many years the Tartar emperors maintained in the

held at least 600,000 cavalry, for which the horses were drawn chiefly from our

plateau. This enormous cavahy force was engaged in fighting over au area of

many thousand miles in length and breadth, during which operations much desperate

resistance was encountered. It was occupied in steep ascents and descents, in

Howtraversing deserts, in crossing frozen lakes, in swimming rapid rivers.  vastlj'

numerous theu must have been the casualties among the horses, and how immense

the breeding studs. The pasturage too was so potent in nutritive qualities that

ordinarily there was risk of animals suffering from repletion, and emaciated crea-

tures rapidly gained flesh and strength.

  --The flora too, though less abundant, has its specialities the pointed grasses

sharp enough to pierce leather, the gigantic rhubarb, the magnificent holly, the

branching juniper.

     The mineral resources of the Kuen-lun are certainly enormous ; nobody yet

knows how great they may prove. Indeed our plateau is remarkable for its

antimony, its sidplmr, its saltpetre, its borax, its gold-washings, its turquoise,

and its classic jadestone.

In tlie seventh place, the field offered by our plateau for scientific research will

be apparent from even a cursory consideration of the stage to which our knowledge

has reached. From the second of the two diagrams, which shows in deep pink

those portions of Asia that have been professionally surveyed, in light pink those

that have been roughly surveyed, in lighter pink "those that have been explored

--only, and in white those that are unexplored it will be seen that almost the

whole of our plateau is unsurveyed, and that while much of it has been explored
more or less, some portions yet await exploration. For some time, however, it has
been tbe sphere chosen by many among the most skilful, enduring, and intrepid

travellers of Europe. The journeys of the Russian Prejevalsky in the Tarim basin

and Mongolia, of Potanin and RafailofF in the same region, of Malussovski near

Forsyth, Trotter, Johnson, Shaw, Ilayward in the Tarim basin, of Wood in the
Pamir, of Ney Elias in Mongolia, of Dilke and Delmar Morgan in Kulja, of Bogle
and Manning in Tibet, while teaching us much, have yet left our minds dazed with

a sense of what remains to be learnt. Even the trigonometrical determination of the
Himalayan summits by the English Surveyors-General, namely, Everest, Waugh,

and \^'alker, the researches of Easevi, Stolicska, Godwin-Austen, Thomson,

Biddulph, in the same quarter, and the Siberian surveys by the Prussians among

the Altai and Tian Shan mountains, have brought us only to the verge of half-

discovered or undiscovered countries. The greatest unexplored region in all Asia,
namely the Kuen-lun range, lies in the very heart of our plateau. It is remarkable

too that if the principal geographical problems awaiting solution in Asia be speci-

(ied, such as the true and ultimate sources of the Ploang-ho, the Irrawaddi, the
Salwin, the Mekhong, the relation of the San-po with the Brahmaputra, the con-
necting links between the Kuen-lun and the Chinese mountain-chains,--they will be
found to concern our plateau.

    At a few points only has our plateau been penetrated by geological surveys,

namely, in some parts of the Altai and at the western end of the Thian Shan

and these surveys are Russian. In the Himalayas, the Karakuram, and the

Western Kuen-lun, the geologists of the Indian Government have begun their re-

searches. But the formations, the strata, the upheavals, tbe denudations, the

Afluvial action, awaiting scientific examination, are indescribably great.  notion

of some of the questions inviting inquiry from the geologist and palaeontologist
may be gathered from what has been already said under previous headings in

respect to the general desiccation and the subsidence or evaporation of the

primeval waters.

To the naturalist few regions present more surprising opportunities for the

observation of the coming, the resting, the departing of migratory birds.

     To meteorologists many of the natural phenomena must prove highly interesting

--the causation of the wondrous dryness, the etlects produced on animal comfort

by the rarefaction of the air, the mummified bodies dried up without undergoing

putrefaction, the clouds of salt-particles driven along by furious gusts and filling

the atmosphere, the fires in the parched vegetation of the desert, the spontaneous

ignition of coal-beds, the caves emitting sulphurous gases, the rocky girdle of

syenite boimding the Gobi desert, the gradual contraction of the glaciers, the

ordinarily rainless zones sometimes invaded by rain-storms with a downpour like

that of the tropics.

    In the eighth place, our plateau is now under one imperial jurisdiction, and
offers many problems for social inquirers. It belontrs entirely to the Chinese

empire with the exception of one small tract where the Russian authorities have

crossed the mountain border. The geographical features for the most part favour

national defence and territorial consolidation. The old Chinese Wall is still suitable

to the political geography of to-day. In the Zungarian strait, however, in the

Hi vallej' near Kulja, perhaps, also, in the line of the Black Irtish, near Zaisan, the

Chinese empire, in its contact with Russia, has weak points strategically, or chinks

in its armour. Though the plateau was originally under the Chinese suzerainty, it

became, under the Mongolian emperor Chinghiz Khan and his successors, the mis-

tress of China, as indeed of all Asia and of Eastern Europe. As the Mongol power,
however, shrunk and withered, the Chinese re-asserted themselves. At length,

under a dynasty from Manchuria outside our plateau, the Chinese became lords over

the regions within its limits. The Zungarian tribe of Eleutbs rose, and after severe

military operations were suppressed. The Muhammadan inhabitants of the Tarim

basin rebelled against the Chinese Government, and for a while maintained an

independent principality for Islam. It was during this time that the British

sovereign sent an envoy to Yarkand to conclude a commercial treaty, in 1873.

Subsequently the Chinese broke down this rising independence, and the whole

region of the Tarim receives its orders from the emperor at Pekin.
     The decline and fall of the Mongol empire, the disruption of that wide-spread
               TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.                 621

dominion, like the breaking up of the ice on its own frozen rivers, are historical

themes beyond the scope of this address. But the changes which have gradually

come over the national character of Mongolians are cognate to the studies of

geographers. As already seen, the annals of the Mongols reveal one of tlie many

examples of the theory of causation, explaining how geographical surroundings

mould or aifect the human character. There remain the mountains, the sea of un-

dulating uplands, which are still among the few important regions not essentially

modified by human action. The pine forests, though hardly intact, have not been

--extensively cleared. There is the dread desert where to the ears of superstitious

--Mongols the roll of the mustering drums and the shouts of victorious battle are

audible which has engulfed in sandy waves additional tracts once produc-

tive. The pastoral resources, the nomadic diet and exercises, the social arrange-

ments, are in kind the same as of yore, though perhaps modified in extent or degree.

The short-lived heat may perhaps be gaining strength as the ages advance ; but the

winters must be nearly as long and hard as ever. Thus the same physical and

climatic conditions which once caused the Mongolian nation to become one of the

mightiest engines ever directed by man are still surrounding the politically degene-
rate Mongols of to-day, who are best represented by the tribe of Khalkas. Once

audaciously ambitious, the Mongols are now sluggish and narrow-minded once
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

passionately fond of an independence as free as their mountain air, they are now

submissive to the domination of races formerly despised by them as inferior ; once

proud of a tribal organisation and a voluntary discipline which wrought world-

renowned wonders, they are now split up into factions like a faggot of sticks
Athat has been unbound.
                         man who, though the feeblest of pedestrians, grips

with his bowed legs the saddle of the most restive horse as with a vice, is all that

remains of the historic Mongol. It is for the social inquirer to determine what

have been the circumstances counteracting the climatic and local causes which

made this nation potential in moulding medieval history.

Here too may be observed the tendencies of Paganism, Buddhism, and Mu-

hammadanism respectively. Of all regions our plateau oflers the best means of

studying Buddhism, which still counts more adherents than any other faith.

Though the mid-Ganges Valley was the birthplace of this widespread rehgion, and

--was for ages regarded by pious Buddhists as their holy lind yet during recent

centuries the active centre of the faith has been in Tibet. Of the four incarnations
of Buddha now held to exist, three are within our plateau, namely, two in Tibet

near Lhassa and at Teshu Lumbo, and one in Mongolia at Urga, near the spot

where mounds attest the burial of heaps of slain after one of Cbinghiz Khan's
earliest battles. In Tibet may be seen to the best advantage those religious cere-

monies, the sight of which has always attracted the observation of Roman Catholic

missionaries.

In conclusion, this brief summary of our geographical knowledge regarding the

plateau of mid-Asia is provisional only. For it avowedly deals with regions

mostly unsurveyed and seldom even explored completely. Further exploration or

discovery therefore may reverse some of our specific conclusions, or may modify the

current of our topographical ideas. It is probable indeed that there will be such

changes, inasmuch as almost every investigation within this vast area has revealed

something unimagined before, or has caused disbelief of something previously

believed. This address, then, is limited to a reswne of things imperfectly known,

with a view of bringing into strong relief two matters which are unquestionable,

namely, the importance of our plateau and the grand field it oSers for research.

If the public consideration of these matters shall induce inquirers to direct their

enterprise towards this grand region, we may hope that by degrees the errors in
our facts may be removed, the misdirection of our conclusions remedied, the vague-
ness of our notions made definite. At present the physical obstacles in the path of

such inquiries are so grave as to be almost deterring. But they do not finally

deter those who after forethought decide to brave peril, distress, sickness, suSering,

in order to enlarge the bounds of knowledge. Each inquirer, however, has the

consolation of reflecting that he makes the rough ways smoother for those who

shall come after him. Every journey that is accompUshed must facilitate successive

discovery in the same line of country. Probably as fast as one line is made good
geographically fresh lines may present themselves, and new vistas will be opened
to the astonished gaze of geographers. At length, with all the constancy and
courage which arduous travel never fails to inspire, the inquirers of the future will
doubtless explore this plateau till it becomes as well known as the Alpine regions

of Europe.

           2. On the Geographical Evolution of the Tanganyika Basin.
                              By Joseph Thomson, F.B.G.S.

     The keynote of this paper is struck by a reference to a recent lecture of Dr.
Archibald Geikie, to the Royal Geographical Society, in which he points out that
the days are now oA'er in which the scientific geographer is content with the simple

description of the superficial aspects of the various regions of the globe. He must
also know how they came to be, and what they have been in the past. This line

of inquiry is applied by Mr. Thomson to the lake regions of Central Africa, but
more particidarly to the Tanganyika Basin. In the first place he presented a bird's-
eye view of the lake regions from the Indian to the Atlantic Ocean, bringing into
relief only the most prominent features of the geography, but describing more in
detail the aspect of the Tangan-s-ika Basin, round which the chief interest centres.
From a description of these purely superficial matters he proceeded to describe what
these have been in the remote past, and the manner in which they liave been

evolved, being of course compelled to call in the assistance of the sister science

 geology.

      The conclusions he arrived at as to the primary origin of the region were, from
purely hypothetical considerations, based on the theory of a shrinking nucleus, and
the necessary eflects on the earths crust arising therefrom. At a later stage,
however, he was able to appeal to the rocks themselves as to the aboriginal con-

 ditions of the African continent south of the Equator, These, according to
 Mr. Thomson, prove the existence of an immense central sea cut ofl" from

the ocean by the elevation of the continent, and which was almost conterminous

 with the present drainage area of the Congo. An elevated ridge was upheaved

 along the eastern boundary of this sea, the origin of the trough of Tanganvika,
 by the collapse of the centre of this ridge and the central sea, subsequently drained

 away to the west, leaving Tanganyika isolated. Mr. Thomson then proceeded
 to describe how its secondary characters arose, and its scenery was moulded, by

 the action of sub-aerial denudation on rocks of different powers of resisting
 the decomposing and eroding agents, and explained the curious marine-like type
 of its shells, the origin of its outlet, the Lukuga, the freshening of the water of
 the lake, and finally the curious intermittency of the outflow.

      The various stages in the evolution of the Tanganyika Basin were summarised

 as follows :

      The first appearance of the future continent, he had been led to believe from
 various theoretical considerations, was the appearance of a fold of the earth's crust
 boimded by two lines of weakness converging towards the south, which fold
 gradually rose till it appeared above the ocean, first along these two lines of
 weakness, in the form of a series of islands, which finally joined, enclosing in their
 centre a large part of the ocean. This enclosed water area formed a great central
 sea, and the enclosing land along the lines of weakness is now indicated by the
  east and west coast ranges.

       In the second stage the continent of Africa south of 5░ N. latitude presented the
  outline of the continent of to-day.

      The third stage showed the central plateau with the great central sea very much
  diminished in size and almost coinciding with the present Congo Basin. There was

  as yet no e^adence of the existence of Tanganyika.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.     623

     After an enormous period of undisturbed deposition of sand in the sea, the

fourth stage was ushered in by a period of great continental convulsions. On the
line of the future Tanganyika a huge boss of rock was intruded into the throbbing

crust, and the surrounding region elevated to a considerable extent, followed by
the subsequent collapse of the body of the elevated area originating the great abyss
of Tanganyika.

     The fifth great stage was marked by the formation of a channel through the
western coast mountain, causing the draining of the great central sea, which
immediately became the inner drainage area of the Congo.

     The sixth stage then saw Tanganyika isolated as a lake by itself, from which
time dates the moulding of its present scenery, the formation of an outlet, the
freshening of its waters, and the lowering of its level, and finally the intermit-
tency of the lake's outflow was explained by the probable fact that the rainfall and

evaporation nearly balance each other in ordinary seasons.

3. On the Royal Geographical Society's Map of Eastern Eqrtatorial Africa.
                             By E. G. Eavenstein, F.B.G.8.

     The map, the construction of which had been intrusted to Mr. Eavenstein by the
Coimcil of the Royal Geographical Society, was intended to embody, in a tangible
manner, all the information that had been collected up to the time of publication.
Large as had been the number of African explorers, much yet remained to be done
before our knowledge, even of the more accessible parts of Africa, could be looked
upon as satisfactory. Apart from the line of coast, -where the minute surveys of
Captain Wharton and others afforded an excellent base, there were but a few isolated
localities which had been determined in a trustworthy manner by astronomical obser-
vations. On the Upper Zambezi, Livingstone, Molir, and Serpa Pinto differed in their
results to a very serious extent. Between Zanzibar and Tanganyika the only point
satisfactorily determined was the capital of Unyanyembe (which Speke observed),
whilst the delineation of the lake depended upon Captain Oambier's determination
of Karema. Von der Decken's expedition had supplied trustworthy information as
regarded the position of Kilimanjaro and other points nearer the coast. In Southern
Abyssinia, M. d'Abbadie's network of triangles, supplemented as it had been recently
by Cecchi and Chiarini, afforded an excellent basis for mapping a wide stretch of
country. The exact determination of the course of the Upper Nile we owed to
Captain Watson, R.E., who was fortunate enough to observe a transit of ' Venus,'
whilst at Gondokoro, in 1872. It resulted from this observation that Khartum lay
eight miles to the east of the position assigned to it by Captain Bizemont, a change,
sanctioned by the careful surveys made between El Fashr, Khartum, and Dongola
by the English engineers working under Mr. Fowler. Good longitudes were few
and far between, but latitudes were fortunately very numerous.

    As to altitudes, the results were most discordant, and differences of 1,000 feet
in a total altitude of 5,000 were by no means rare. The establishment of permanent
studies by the French and German African Associations would no doubt render
future observations for height more trustworthy. For the present, he thought we

were safe in assigning to Tanganyika a height of 2,700 feet, whereas the Victoria
Nyanza lay probably at an elevation of 4,000 feet.

     After a rapid examination of the principal explorations which had yielded
materials for the map, the vast region stretching along the eastern margin of the
Victoria Nyanza right away to Southern Abyssinia and Harar was pointed out as
the vastest and most promising field of exploration in Eastern Africa.

2. On Merv. By E. O'Donovan.

Starting from Kelat-i-Nadiri Mr. OTonovan travelled to Archengau, and thence

northward to Kahka, a considerahle walled village of 5,000 inhabitants. His next

station was Dushakh, or Chard(5h, twenty-five miles distant to westward, and beyond

it, some thirty-five miles, the Tekke colony of M6hna. From this latter he started

direct for Merv. The ground up to the banks of the river Tejend was flat, partly
cultivated, and cut up in many places by the beds of old irrigation canals. The

river itself, about fifty yards wide, had cut a shallow ravine some twenty feet in

depth. The water was sufiiciently low in that month (March) to allow the stream

to be forded, though with difliculty. Trees of various kinds grew plentifully

along it, and drift wood had accumulated at places in great quantities. The plain

beyond was marly and overgrown with tamarisk bushes. The only water met

with was a very brackish well at Shahidli, about half-way between the Tejend and

Murghab. Some miles further on were the ruins of a large caravanserai at a place

called Dash Robat, and then the inhabited oasis was reached, everywhere dotted

with groups of beehive-shaped huts, fifteen feet in diameter, and twelve in lieight.

Through its midst the river Murghab flowed, and at a dam at the southern end

of the Tekke territory two canals branched ofl", the Alasha to the west, the Novur to

the right. These supply the irrigation trenches of the ground occupied by the

Toktamish and Otamisn Turkomans, the first settled ou the eastern, the second

on the western banks of the river. The Merv oasis is some forty-five miles in

length from north to south, and thirty-five in breadth. Numerous groves of fruit

trees surround the villages. The staple products are corn of various kinds, melons,

cows, sheep and goats. Manufactures there are none, save that of hand-made

carpets, which are exported to Persia and Bokhara in very limited quantities.

On the eastern margin of the oasis are the ruins of the old cities of Merv. The

--oldest is named Giaour Kala, and is about 900 yards square. The ramparts are

forty feet in height huge earth-banks in fact. This was destroyed by the Arabs,

A.D. 666. The next in age of the cities is named at present Sultan Sanjar. The

walls are in a good state of preservation. Their circuit is about 2,500 yards. In

the midst of the enclosed space stands the lofty domed mausoleum of Sultan

Sanjar. The town was taken and ruined in the thirteenth century by a son of

Genghis Khan. The third and latest city, destroyed nearly a century ago by the
ABokharians, stands close by, and is named Bairam Ali.
                                                         little to the northward

are the remains of an extensive entrenchment, called by the Turkomans, Iskander

Kala, or the fort of Alexander. These ruins, situated but 1,000 yards apart,

are entirely uninhabited. The population of the Merv oasis is estimated at half a

million, which is probably not an excessive computation. The two great divisions,

the Toktamish and Otamish, are governed by two hereditary chiefs, that of the

Toktamish being the senior and taking precedence at the medjlis or general

council of the elders of the nation.

The soil of Merv is very fertile, as is also that of the country far and near on

every side of it, and were it not for lack of water the entire plain from the Oxus

and Merv to the Caspian might be highly cultivated, for the desert is not a sandy

one, but of sun-scorched marl.

There is now no central point like the Merv of old. The only rallying point of

the Turkomans is at Koushid Khan Kala, a great earthwork on the eastern bank of

the Murghab at about the centre of the oasis. Here some 2,000 huts are gathered

together, and here dwell the principal Turkoman chiefs.

     3. On the Identification of certain Ancient Diamond Mines in India,
                   By Professor V. Ball, M.A., F.E.S., F.O.S.

     The vague references to India, as the only then known source of diamonds, by
the "writers of li,000 years ago, give place to more definite indications of position
in Sanscrit works of the sixth century, and possibly of somewhat earlier dates.
In the Barhat Sanhita a list of localities is given, but as the stones from some of
the localities therein mentioned were copper-coloured, it is possible that they were

not diamonds.
      In the Ain-i-Akbari (1590), and also less clearly in Ferishta's History (1425),

a locality named Beiragarh is referred to, which can be identified with Wairagarh
in the Central Provinces, where the remains of ancient mines are still to be seen.

     The following localities mentioned by Tavernier (1665), had not been identified
until lately, though various attempts had been made by Colonel Eeimell and others
since his time. Gani or Coulour is KoUur on the Kistna, Gani simply standing for
Kan-i ov mine of; Raolcouda is Kamulkota in Karuul ; Soumelpour was on the
Koel river in the Palamow district of Bengal.

     Kollur would appear from Tavemier's statement to have been the mine where
the Great Mogul diamond was found. The same stone is perhaps identical with
one mentioned by Garciiis ab Horto, who wrote 100 years before Tavernier, but if
so it must have been found several centuries before the time (fifteenth century) in-
dicated by Tavernier.

     Tlie author referred to several other early authorities, and to the mythical
stories which are connected ^^иith the accounts of diamond-mining, for the origin of
which he proposed explanations.

4. The Geograjihy and Meteorology of Kansas. By Litton Forbes,

                                             M.B., F.B.G.S.

The author, who had had large personal experience in Kansas and Colorado,

desired to point out some facts in the geography and meteorology of Western

Kansas, which, perhaps, had not received all the attention they deserved. The

physical conditions of this State, the most central of the Union, were in many

respects peculiar. It was a land of undulating plains, almost as flat to the eye as

Holland or Egypt. Its watercourses, its soil, and above all its climate, presented

many points of interest. It would be perhaps impossible to find a country of equal

extent where the physical changes produced by the advent of civilisation have been

so numerous and so important. Not only has the fauna been in great part changed,

but the flora also, as well as the amount of rainfall, and the general hygrometric

conditions of the atmosphere. Not merely has the nimiber of inches of annual

rainfall increased, but it has also been more equably extended over a larger extent

of country. The procession westward of the rainfall of Kansas in proportion as

settlement has extended westward, is a most important fact. It may be due in

part to the planting of timber, but is probably much more directly dependent on the

immense acreage under wheat, indian-corn,and other crops, which afford protection

Ato the earth from the sun's rays, and so check a too rapid evaporation.  careful

study of the changes wrought in the climate of Kansas by settlement might possibly

aid in the solution of certain problems which have long presented themselves in

some of the southern colonies of Great Britain. Many parts of South Australia

and New South Wales assimilate very much to Western Kansas in soil and climate.

Those countries have hitherto been considered as possessing too little moisture for

agriculture, and as therefore fit only for grazing purposes. The same was said of

Kansas some twenty years ago, but within that time very marked climatic changes

have taken place. What settlement has effected in Kansas, it may equally well efi'ect

in Australia, with similarly beneficial results. The State of Kansas forms a rect-

angular parallelogram, which measures about 400 miles from north to south, and

about 200 from east to west, and contains over 82,000 square miles. Though to

1882.  ss
--626 EEPORT 1882.

the ej'e apparently one vast level plain, it is really a more or less elevated plateau,
wliich slopes eastwards at an appreciable angle. The highest, or western portion

of the State is about 4,000 feet above the level of the sea, while the average height

of the whole country may be placed at about 2,375 feet. The main watercourse is

the Arkansas River, which has a fall of about six feet in the mile. In spite of the

absence of hills, Kansas is singularly free from marshland or swamps. This is due

in part to the friable nature of the soil, and in part to the natural slope of the

land towards the east. What is known as the ' Great Arkansas Valley of South-

Western Kansas,' embraces a width of fifty miles, nearly the whole of which is

slopuig upland. The soil here is a sandy loam, of alluvial origin, and of great

Adepth and fertility.  remarkable peculiarity of the Arkansas lliver is that it

never overflows its banks, but, so to say, underflows them. The water filters

through the gravelly stratum underlyiug the surface-soil of the valley, and may

always be found by digging for it.  _

From a meteorological point of view, Kansas may be said to be divided into

three distinct zones, marked off by the amoimt of rainfall. In the extreme east,

the rainfall assimilates itself to that of IMissouri, and is ample for all purposes of

agricidture. In the middle zone, which may be said to lie in Central Kansas, the

rainfall is less, but yet amply suihcient for all purposes of farming or pastm-age.

The vegetation here is extraordinarily profuse, and is subtropical in character. The

third and last zone lies in the western and south-western portions of the State.

Here the climate assimilates itself to that of Colorado, and the rainfall is insulhcieut

for agriculture, though suihcient for grazing purposes. It would seem, however,

that the limits of the zone of moderate rainfall are constantly proceeding west as

civilisation advances westwards. Twenty-five years ago, the frontier of agricidtural

production was placed at about the 96th degree of Western longitude. Ten years

later it had advanced to the 97th, five j-ears later to the 98th, while to-day it may be

said to extend to the 100th. Along with this advance the character of the flora of the
country has appreciablj- changed. The ' blue stem ' grass and other plants which

requii'e moisture have displaced the buffalo or 'gramma ' grass which is the natural

covering of the great plains. Whether the procession of the rainfall will continue

to advance as heretofore, when once it has reached the 100th meridian of west longi-

tude, ma)' fairh' be open to question. The prevailing winds from May to September

are from the south and south-west. But inasmuch as the western limit of the

Gulf of Mexico is in the 98th meridian, it follows that these winds must blow over

the arid and thirsty soil of Mexico, and therefore will contain little moisture.

Hence this western portion of Kansas must long continue to be an essentially dry
country. Much, later on, may indeed be done by judicious irrigation, and some-

thing possibly by artesian wells. Cultivation will no doubt iu time modify the

climate of Western Kansas, as it has modified that of Central. But the pro-

cess will be slower and accompanied by greater difficulties. The past history

of Kansas, however, forbids us to doubt that iu time these difficulties will either be

overcome, or will have ceased to exist. The people of Kansas are a remarkable

class of settlers even for Western America. The settlement of the country has

been helped much by excellent natural roads, and Ijy a more than usually energetic

and intelligent population. But after all it is really the railway which has made

Kansas what she is to-day. It is the absence of this American energy and business

enterprise which keeps large portions of our Australian colonies so for behind.

The railways brought settlers to Kansas, and developed the country with a rapidity

and thoroughness which would otherwise have been impossible. One railway has

done it all. The history of the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe railroad is really

the history of Kansas. To the energy, the sagacity, the business acumen, and the

capital of that corporation, the prosperity of Kansas is mainly due. This is an

important fact which should not be lost sight of in some of our own southern

colonies, whose physical and political conditions are much the same as those of

Kansas were a few years ago.

 5. The Spanish Tervitories of North America. By E. Von Hesse Waktegg.

      The completion of the new Southern Railroad line across the North American
 continent to the Pacific coast, within the last two years, opened to geographical
 explorers and travellers a new held of research and discovery, heretofore rarely
 visited and very little known on account of the great dangers and hardships of the
 long and tedious overland voyage thither.

   -- --New Mexico and Arizona, centuries ago thicldy inhabited by the aboriginal

 races the Toltecs and the Aztecs were afterwards made tributary to Spanish and
 Mexican rule, until they came under the United States' Government in 18-40. Even

-- --then these two south-western territories comprising nearly 240,000 square miles

 remained unexplored, some reconuaissauces of the United States' military officers ex-
 cepted, among- which are those of Major Powell and Lieutenants Ives and Amory.

New Mexico and Arizona, the oldest territories of North America, may therefore be

 called, with equal reason, the newest ; and as they will evidently soon come into pro-
 minent notice, tlie author made them the object of a prolonged journey during the
 first month of 1882.

      Although on the same latitude, and bordering upon each other, they are very
 dissimilar in their general character, mostly on account of the Ilocky Mountain Range

 and the distribution of the water-supph'.

     New Mexico is by far the more fertile and more interesting of the two ; especially

 in the valley of the Rio Grande, the principal river of the territory, traversing it
 from north to south. This valley, in its general character, its population, ancient ruins
and aboriginal habitations, its products and the maimer of agriculture, possesses a

 certain similarity to Eirypt.

      The Pueblo "(Town) Indians, inhabiting this valley and the neighbouring high
 ^lesas, are the object of the greatest curiosity to every scientific observer, for they are
undoubtedly lineal descendants of the great Aztec race, although some claim them to
be of Toltec origin. The author spent considerable time in their fortresses and
pueblos, and discovered many highly interesting details regarding their life, their
origin, and tlieir relationship to other races. The country around the Rio Grande

is full of ancient pueblo ruins, of cliff-dweller houses, burial caves, hieroglyphic in-

scriptions, and ancient stone implements.

     The highly fertile Rio Grande valley forms the nucleus of New Mexican wealth,

population, agriculture, and traffic. Tlie old Mexican and Indian inhabitants are
doomed, and will soon be driven away by the industrious Northerners. The largest
cities, including Santa Fo, the capital, Albuquerque and El I'aso, li" in or near this
valley. Most of the enormous mineral wealth of the territory is to be found in the
mountain ranges on both sides of the river. Towards the south the valley diminishes
in extent and fertility, and enters at last a great cactus desert, called the Tornada

del Muerto.

     The high plateau of the eastern half of the territory contains much arable and
pasture ground admirably adapted for sheep and cattle raising. The western half

of New Mexico in general character resembles Arizona, which is the most sterile of

any State or Territory of North America, with comparatively very little agriculture
in some of the valleys, and limited capacity for cattle-raising. The immense tract
of land lying between the Rio Colorado and the Rio Gila (these being the two great
rivers of Arizona) is nearly destitute of all water. The southern part of the terri-
tory is little more than a desert, with occasional fields of giant cactus the tempe-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

rature is mild and agreeable in winter, but of excessive and luibearable heat in
summer.

     The great strength and the principal resources of Arizona are her enormous
mineral wealtli, including very rich deposits of gold and silver; also her scenery,
which, especially in the northern part and along the Colorado canons, is unequalled
in grandeur and weirdness. It will require more railways and settlers to develop
the resources of Arizona, and overpower the Navajoes and Apache Indians, whose
ravages are still occasionally severely felt by the settlers.

     The following Report and Papers were read :

               2. On some unexplored or little hnov:n parts of Persia.
                By Colonel Sir Oliver St. John, B.E., K.C.S.I.

     This was an account of a journey hy a partially unexplored road from Bushire to
the interior, mainly interesting as being that hy which the Persian army brought
its guns to the coast in the war of 1856-7, and as passing through the country
occupied by the Kashkais, the principal tribe of Toork nomads in Fars. Though less
difficult than the ordinary route, it is rarely if ever used by caravans, owing to the
want of water on one or more stages, and the liability to attack by the nomads.
Leaving Bushire on March 8, the author, who was accompanied by Ladj' St. John,

marched through Ahram to Khormuj at the foot of the mountain of that name,
well known in the Persian gulf as a prominent landmark. Here the travellers were
entertained by the chief of the district of Dashti, of which Khormuj is the principal

place. This part of the country had suffered little from the famine then raging
owing to the staple diet of the people being dates, of which the harvest had been
abundant, but the horses, the breeding of which used to be a source of considerable
profit, had nearly all perished from bad or insufficient nourishment. Leaving

Khormuj, Sir 0. St. John marched to Laweb, whence a difficult pass, called the
Tang-i-sehdar, ' The Defile of the Three Gates,' brought him in two days to Kalima,
only twelve miles from Ahram as the crow flies. The detour made was about
70 miles, and was necessitated by the impossibility of getting loaded mules through
the pass which directly connects Ahram and Kalima. This latter village, 1,000

feet above the sea, is in the lowest of the terrace-like valleys intervening between

the highlands and the coast. Two long marches brought the party to the large

village of Farashband in the wide grassy valley, 3,000 feet above the sea, which
occupies the second of the terraces, and forms the winter grazing-grounds of the
nomad tribes of Toorks called Kashgais, from Kashgar in Central Asia, whence
their ancestors emigrated into Persia, in the train of Jaiigis Khan or one of his suc-

cessors. From Farashband the party marched N.W. along the valley to beyond

Jereh, where they were entertained lor several days bj^ Ali Kuli Khan, the llbegi,
or second chief of the Kashgais. t'oncerning the manners and customs of this

important and powerful tribe many details were giA'en, which, however, do not permit
of compression. On leaving the llbegi's camp, a march of fifteen miles brought Sir

0. St. John to the high road between Bushire and Shiraz, which is well known.

3. On the various means of communication hetiveen Central Bersia and the

    Sea. By Lieut. -Colonel J. W. Batejian Champain, B.E., F.B.G.S.

     The author began bj' drawing attention to the very defective means of loco-
motion in Persia, and briefly described the troubles and inconveniences which travel-
lers in this country are compelled to encounter. The Government pays little or no
attention to the communications ; and the caravanserais, causeways, and bridges
which exist are nearly always the work of private individuals, who leave them after

completion to take care of themselves.
     Persia is a country of about 000,000 square miles in extent, but with one excep-

tion boasts of not a single navigable river or canal. It may be described as a

plateau averaging from 3,000 to 5,000 feet above the level of the sea, and although
                                                                                    TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  629

a great part is an unmitigated desert, there are in many parts valleys and plains of

astonishing fertility. The general scarcity of water reduces the capabilities of the

country and accounts for the sparseness of the population.

The trade is, however, considerable, and might be vastly increased by the im-

provement of the roads. After indicating the nature of the ordinary exports and

imports, the author proceeded to point out how the trade from Russia is gradually

superseding that from British sources, not only in the north, as might reasonably

be expected, but also in the southern markets of the empire.

The difficulties of the several trade routes from the Persian Gulf to the interior

were then briefly described, and attention was directed to the natural facilities

offered by the Karun river as a means of communication with the provinces of

Shuster, Dizful, and other parts of Persia as yet scarcely touched by the European

trader. Mohammerah, as the port of this route, possesses remarkable advantages.

It commands two distinct means of communication with the Gulf, the Shat-el-Arab,

and the Khor Bamushir, and the climate of the place is excellent. If trade by the

Karuu route were properly fostered by the Persian Government, Mohammerah

might rival in importance its neighbour, the Turkish port of Bussorah. Reference

was made to Captain Selby's exploration of the Karun in 1842, and also to Mr.

Mackenzie's journe3-s between Shuster and Isfahan. This route has been travelled

over again last November by Mr. Baring of Her Majesty's Mission and Captain

AVells, R.E., who have written very graphic accounts of their trip. Mr. Mackenzie

thinks that the route between Shuster and Isfahan is far easier and better than the

one now followed to the latter city from Bushire, through Shiraz ; and he explains
how advantageous it would be to British commercial enterprise were this route

opened up. Captain Wells, on the other hand, considers the difficulties of the direct

road to Isfahan to be very formidable. In any case the establishment of regular

steam navigation on the Karun would open out new fields, and commercial opera-

tions would gradually but surely extend further inland.

The only physical obstacle to the regular running of steamers on the river occurs

at Ahwaz, and is fully explained in Captain Wells's report and on his plan exhibited.

Means are suggested for overcoming this difficulty by cutting a canal some 2, .350

--yards in length from above to below the rapids a work which presents no diffi-

culties and would cost but little. Tlie Persian Government has, however, so far

shown itself distinctly opposed to the development of trade in this direction, and,

actuated by a very short-sighted policy, refuses to allow foreign steamers on the

Ariver unless heavy, in fact prohibitive, taxes be paid as river and port dues.

little judicious and well-timed diplomatic pressure might probably remove this an-

tagonistic feeling                                                                  and, in the interests of Persia and with the object of promoting
                                                                                 ;

and extending British trade and influence in these regions, the author believed that

friendly action should be taken by the British Government.

4. Statistical Account of Railway Accidents for the year 1881.^

              By the Rev. Daniel Ace, B.I)., F.R.A.S.

     During the year there were reported sixty collisions between passenger-trains
and others, by which it would appear that of all modes of travelling that of railway
is the safest. The casualties are few compared with tlie millions of passenger-

journeys included in the reckoning of accidents arising out of the use of other

vehicles, such as vans, carts, and waggons.

Railway statistics show a comparatively small sacrifice of life in that class of

accidents over which the victims cannot be supposed to have any control. It is

here that the test of efficiency has to be apphed, and although any sacrifice of life
is to be regretted, the fact that only 23 passengers were killed by want of caution,
or misconduct, or circumstances under their own control, out of the myriads who
travelled on the railways of the United Kingdom last year, must be held to show

a marvellous degree of "skill and care in the working of the traffic.  _

Upon examination of the statistics it will be evident that the suicides were 64,

thus almost trebling the number of passengers killed by railway accidents pure

and simple. But there were accidents to passengers from other causes than
accidents of trains, including, besides accidents from their own waut of caution or
misconduct, those happening to persons passing over level crossings ; these amounted

to 83 persons killed, and 32 injured. Level crossings, where they exist, are little

better than man-traps.

   A feature by no means to be overlooked consists in the nature of accidents

which befall the companies' servants. That more than 500 of the subordinates
should be killed in a single year is a serious matter, and must exhibit a very high

death-rate if compared with the entire number on the staff, of whom signalmen

mshould be protected from over-work and liberally remunerated. There were

the division mentioned 552 persons killed and 1,132 injured. Altogether the
number of persons killed and injured on railways during the year ending De-

Ato 1,140 persons killed, and 8,676 injured.  CTOvernment inspector remarked

when observin<? the fatality of railway servants, ' that it was a scandal that sixteen
consecutive hours of work should be exacted from any man upon whose vigilance

occasion a fatal catastrophe.

                              FRIDAY, AUGUST 25.

    The Peesidext delivered the following Address :

                       On Local Government in Biiral Districts,

In selecting Local Government in the Rural Districts for the subject of my address

I have no wish to transgress the rules of the Association, which eliminate contro-

versial politics from the materials for our discussions ; on the contrary, I am anxious
to seize an opportunity which thus presents itself of securing for what is, or ought

to be, a non-political question, the chance of being considered and examined in a
non-political atmosphere.

     There are also some circumstances and arrangements to be found in the local
government of the county of Hampshire, commonly called the county of South-

ampton, which seem peculiarly worthy of notice by way of illustrating what is or
mav be tlie state of things under the existing law and practice.

     Those who desire to enter into the question of local government historically,

analytically, and comprehensively, will find it dealt with <?& oi'o, and in an exhaustive

manner, by my friend the Warden of Merton College, Oxford, in an excellent essay
published by the Oobden Club (in their volume for 1882). Such is not my inten-

tion. I wish rather to take it up on the assumption that the actual facts of the

case are more or less familiarly known to my hearers, and to offer some observa-
tions, the result of my own laiowledge and experience, which may direct attention
632 KEPORT-- 1882.

to certain aspects, hitherto little regarded, of what is undoubfedly a difficult and
important subject, but one as to which, perhaps, we shall find, on examination,

that the difficulty and importance have been exaggerated, confused, and ob.^^cnred

by misleading conceptions and imperfect appreciation of its bearings.

    Many people, and those not always the best acquainted by experience with the
workmg of our local institutions, have committed themselves a little hastily to a

condemnation of the chaotic condition and nuschievous working of the existing

system ; and these are just the class of thinkers who, from the bias of their minds,
are impatient of anything short of scientific rearrangement and completeness, the

bureaucrats of a centralising government, or the fanatics of political philosophy.

The urgent need of a ' root and branch ' change, again, has been exaggerated by

the jealousies and rivalries of political partisans.

    In singular contrast with these it is interesting and profitable to notice how
little the local authorities who are engaged in the administration of the rates, or

the ratepayers themselves, have responded to the attempts which have been made

from time to time, and particularly of late years, to get political capital out of

these questions. Common sense and practical knowledge teach them to mistrust
platform oratory on such humdrum subjects, which attract little real interest
amongst politicians ; while the)' know from their own experience that many of the

complaints (not all) are beside the mark, and instinctively feel that some of the re-

medies proposed may turn out worse for their interests than the evils complained of.
    Ambiguous language in this, as in many other things, is the cause of a number

of current fallacies. Local government means quite a different thing as applied to,

firstly, rural, secondly, semi-rural, and thirdly to urban communities ; but this is
forgotten in the eagerness for uniformity and simplicity of system. The genius,

however, of the English people is not favourable to a highly scientific organisation

like that of the French, who have much more of the form, with less of the reality,

of local self-government than is to be found in this country ; and even in France it

required no less formidable an instrument than the great Eevolution to obliterate

the old names and landmarks which had prevailed during the monarchy. The
demand for mimicipal government in our counties, which is derived, perhaps,

from the present French system, involves the fallacious assumption that the sort of

administration which is needed for towns is required, or even possible, in rural

districts.

    If we find a thorough system of municipal government established for cities
and towns, and provisions of law in constant and useful operation for the

gradual introduction of the same into growing or inchoate urban communities,

(which is really the case), it may fairly be argued that tlie rural and scattered
population of the counties, whatever may be needed in the way of improved

representation on their governing bodies, do not really require, and are not, in fact,

in a position to profit from such local government as is primarily adapted to the

wants of towns and cities, and such as is within their reach as and when the want
of them is experienced.

    As population increases in compactness and wealth it begins, of course, to

require municipal government for many purposes apart from the primary objects
of police supervision and the maintenance of order. The householders in common

council together find they can provide better and more cheapl}' through such
means for their common health and wealth, for the cleanliness and convenience of

their dwellings, and for the luxuries which rapidly become the necessities of town

life, such as water-supply, lighting and scavengering of streets, sewerage, building

regulation, fire-prevention, &c. These are objects which householders in rural

districts must provide separately for themselves. Common to both are (1) police

supervision, in so far as that service is borne or assisted by local taxation and

management                                                      (2) road  repair, though  of a  less  expensive  sort in  rural districts
                                                             ;

and, (3) above all, the poor law administration, which forms the real difficulty in har-

monising local government for town and country, and which stands in the way of

those who fancy it easy to reconcile conflicting or intermixed local government

areas.

The Poor Law system, as we now know and have experience of it, was forced
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.  633

fifty years ago on the attention of Parliament and the puhlic by circumstances into
which we need not enter. Under it the fifty-two counties of England and Wales,

containing about 15,000 parishes, have been divided into about 650 unions. These
were marked out and settled in a somewhat bureaucratic and centralising spirit, no

doubt, but still with due regard to the essential object of convenient local adminis-
tration, a convenience which could not be found in symmetry with county areas.
County boundaries were, accordingly, disregarded to such an extent that fully one-

third of the unions overlap the borders of two, or even of three, counties. The
desired objects were, nevertheless, for the most part attained, and may be compre-

--hensively stated under two heads : iirst, the interests of the poor the possible

--recipients of relief as regards the accessibility of the workhouse; and secondly,

the interests of the ratepayers as regards economical management and equitable
grouping of parishes in proportion to their greater or less rateable value, and to their
more or less pauperised condition.

     To whatever criticism the mode in which these unions were laid out may be

open in detail, and although there is ample legal power for their alteration and
amendment, there can be no question but that they are so far stereotyped, as a

great national settlement, that they do not admit of comprehensive re-settlement

not because of any difficulty in drawiug an area map of the kingdom on ditlerent

lines or principles, or with more regard to county and other local boundaries ; but
because the local interests which have grown up during half a century, and which
have been recognised by innumerable Acts of Parliament, are bound up with them,
and are of far greater importance actually, and still more from the point of view of

those locally interested, than any importance which can be quoted as attaching to
the coimty, or to central government considerations.

      Parliament has so far recognised this, and so far committed itself to the union as

the administrative area of the future as contradistinguished from the county, that it

has from time to time attached new functions to the guardians and new importar.ce
and value to the district within which they hold sway. Briefly, they are as follows
1. Each union was composed originally of many parishes, which retained a certain
amount of independent action, and, in particular, the right and duty of the valuation

of property and its assessment to the local rates. These functions were transferred

to the guardians of the union by the Union Assessment Committee Acts. 2. Each
parish was originally made responsible for the cost of its own pauperism ; but, by
the Union Chargeability Act, not only was the expense spread equally, or, rather,

ratably, over the imion, but the management and control of the board of guardians
as a whole over the pauperism of the union became greatly more effective. 3. In

process of time, as the need for sanitary legislation became recognised, each union
was made a separate and complete administrative area for sanitary purposes, with
officers and machinery for carrying out the Public Health Act (which wisely dis-
criminates between the rural and urban districts as regards the stringency and
character of its provisions). 4. Each union has been more recently constituted
a centre of administration under the Education Act, and is charged with the im-
portant duty of enforcing compulsory attendance at elementary schools, and of

paying school fees for the poor under certain circumstances. Here, again, it may

be observed that Parliament has specially provided for the rural districts a machinery
different from that which is adapted to the populous places where the School Board

system may more properly prevail. 5. Each union has functions assigned to it

under the Registration Acts, and is charged with the important duty of enforcing
primary vaccination over the whole kingdom. 6. Lastly, by the 'legislation of
1877-8, the entire management of the highways of the rural districts has been
placed within the power of the guardians, and "the areas of highway management

may become identified with those of the poor law unions.
    It may fairly, therefore, be laid down, that local government for the rural

--districts is actually or potentially provided by these means that it is already too

stereotyped to be shifted without such a wrench as would be of revolutionary se-
verity, and too important, even if that were otherwise, to be subordinated or inter-
fered with for any practical or theoretical objects which have as yet been assigned
as a reason for the constitution of a system of county government.
--634 EEPOET 1882.

Couuty government has a very portentous sound, and the idea of it is plausible

and attractive                                                            but when it comes to be examined, -we find  there is little  meaning'
                                                                    ;

in it as at present exercised, much that is of doubtful expediency in the proposals

for its extension, and no slight fallacy in the idea that it ought to be, or indeed can

\)e, converted into a system of ' municipalities for counties.'

As to the facts, the counties appear, by the Statistical Abstract, to levy for

county and police purposes about one and a half millions annually, of which total

sum it is probable that the larger moiety is required for the latter and secondary

object. It is, no doubt, an anomaly that this money should be levied and expended

by persons who, though deeply interested in public economy, are not the elected

representatives of the ratepayers. Meanwhile it may be noted that the sum of

nine or ten millions, i.e. four or five times that amount, which is required for

poor law, sanitary, and highway purposes, is exclusively raised and administered

by persons annually elected by and responsible to the ratepayers.

If, again, we further analyse the county expenditure, we find that as regards

the police force, for which the larger amount is levied, the county authorities, like

the town councils in boroughs, are only partners with the central government in

respect of the pay and management, and are very much under the control of the

Home Oflice for both.

Of the county rate proper, whicli may be taken in round numbers at about

750,000^., it is probable that about one-half is required for the repayment of loans

raised to meet capital expenditure which has been made obligatory by Parliament

under various statutes for the building and maintenance of prisons and lunatic asy-

lums. Of the remainder, some is expended in discharge of duties imposed by statute

in connection with coroners' inquests, and in the salaries of the coroners themselves.

Heavy expense is likewise incurred under the Cattle Diseases Prevention Acts, the

Sale of Food and Drugs Act, and many other statutes ; so that tlie margi}i of de-

bateable expenditure on salaries of county officers, and on the repair of buildings and

county bridges, amounts to a comparatively insignificant sum in comparison with

the enormous amounts which are directly dealt with by the agency of the Board

of Guardians, a body thoroughh' representative of ratepayers.

    Those who desire to set up the county as an administrative machine for all

purposes, and in relief of our overworked House of Commons, forget how little

meaning the term and name of a county now has, except for political representation

and for the a<hninistration of justice. "What measure, indeed, for county govern-

ment reform could be devised which could provide machinery uniformly applicable

over such widely different areas, in point of size and circumstances, as Devonshire

and Ptutland                                                              or for Lancashire  and  the West Riding, spotted over with   number-
                                                                       ;

less municipalities and local board districts, in common with Cambridgeshire or
West Sussex, with their sparse population of small village communities? Further,

the notion that county parliaments are, as county municipalities, to carry on public

business, to vivify local life, and to relieve the overloaded shoulders of the House of

Commons, is based on a triple fallacy. First, it is assumed that control exercised

by such bodies over the subordinate areas of unions or highway districts and

parishes would be welcomed in exchange for thecontrolof the central government;

whereas they would probably be more unpopular, and certainly less effective.

Secondly, it is forgotten that the requisite machinery for such an organisation and

control could not be brought to bear without great cost and a multiplication of

permanent county officers in continuous session at head-quarters. And thirdlj^,

it is impossible to believe that the public opinion of the countiy would ever

deliberately suffer the parliamentary function to be discharged by sixty or seventy

local centres, taking different, and probably conflicting views of dutj' and policy.

It would indeed be Home Rule for counties, with all the evil omen attaching to

that phrase. Every consideration of prudent statesmanship points to the con-

clusion that county government, if reformed and endowed with an infusion of

the representative element, must be confined to the limited functions now exer-

cised by the Courts of Quarter Sessions, together with such new duties as it
may be found possible to devise without interference with the real and, on the

whole, satisfactory work of the guardians, waywardens, and sanitary authorities,
                 TRAKSACTIONS OF SECTION F.          635

which already are, to all intents and purposes, the municipalities of the rural

districts.

    How nearly the system thus sketched out a priori may be trougrlit into actual

working under the existing law and practice, can be illustrated very well and
appropriately by the state of things which prevails at this moment in the county

of Southampton.

The twenty-five poor-law unions into which Hampshire was divided fifty years

ago, have been, with the exception of three or four parishes, only one of which is

of importance, brought within the county area. The magistrates with wise fore-

thought identified, many years ago, their own magisterial divisions with tho.se of

the poor law imions, and more recently they established, under the Acts of 1862

and 18G4, highway districts conterminous with the same administrative areas.

Quite recently the guardians of several of these unions have taken on themselves,

by a process permitted and encouraged imder recent legislation, the ofiice and

Weduties of highway authorities.        thus have, in the county of Hants, twenty-

five subordinate areas, completely exhaustive of the county map, the governing

bodies of which are poor law guardians, sanitary authorities, valuers and assessors

of real property, waywardens of the highways, supervisors of public vaccination

and of elementary education ; and they discharge these multifarious duties for the

ratepayers, to annual election by whom they owe their existence, and in the

general interests of the public, on whose behalf Parliament has imposed them.

These representative governing bodies levy and expend for the purposes above-

mentioned a sum of about 300,000^. annually, which is equal to a rate of about

2s. 'id. in the pound on a ratable value of about two and a half millions. The

Court of Quarter Sessions, on the other hand, levies annuallj^ about 35,000^., in the

shape of county and police rates, in nearly equal moieties. In other words, the

ratepayers control directly about 2s. 8d. in the pound, while the magistrates expend

about 4d. under these two heads. But, of the monej'S levied for the county, apart

from the police, one-third goes to the payment of debt ; so that the other items of

expenditure, including a heavy contribution to the coSt of the main roads, is

covered by a rate of about 1-^d. in the pound. The ratepayer's grievance being thus

exhibited in its true proportions, the problem for solution becomes difficult in pro-

portion to its minuteness. On the one hand, it is undesirable to establish an electoral

machinery more important and extensive than in proportion to the duties which

have to be discharged; and, on the other hand, any attempt to add new obligations,

or to establish a centralised county authority, having a status and jurisdiction

paramount over the elective guardians, will be certain, as it becomes appreciated

in all its bearings, to excite jealousy and alarm amongst those whose grievances

it is presumably inteiided to redress.

If I may venture, in conclusion, to draw a moral, it would be by way of caution

and advice to those who may be desirous of taking up this subject, to inform them-

selves exactly what alterations and improvements in our system of local areas and

administration are permissible under the existing law, and then to inquire why

they are so rarely effected. The fact is, that no such changes can be made without

touching vested money interests according as the effect will be to increase or diminish

the ratio of rateable value to pauperism ; and this difticulty is aga'ravated where

loans have been raised on the security of the rates. Besides this, the disturbance

of local institutions such as must accompanj^ departmental or legislative activity

is always unpopular; and unpopularity in these days enormously facilitates the

proceedings of the Parliamentary Obstructionist. The fate which has attended all

the endeavours hitherto made to reform county government bears melancholy testi-

mony to the influence of that formidable personage.

It may be nseful to give a few figures in particular illustration of the sums

devoted to diflerent heads of expenditure in the comity of Hampshire, as regards

the union area and the county area respectively.

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.  637

     There is no better method of raising revenue tlian from the consumption of alco-
holic drinks. It is, however, true that much alcohol is used for most proper purposes,

as, for instance, in various manufactures, and even in consumption, wherever it is

beneficially used as a food or as a medicine. There is too great a tendency to mix
up v?ith this the temperance question ; and consequent discussion is usually far too
intemperate in character. There is no doubt that the calm scientific view tells us
a nation may consume much alcohol, and at the same time enjoy the highest moral
and material prosperity. It is not the use, but the abuse, of alcohol which destroys

both these phases of national prosperity.

     In these islands we spend 120,000,000/. sterling in the year on alcoholic drinks,

but no less than one quarter of this is a contribution to the general revenue.

     This source of revenue, however, is failing year by year (see table appended).
Mr. Gladstone tells us the only balance he can discover is that people are drinking
a little more tea and increasing greatly their habit of putting by savings. I wish
to put forward two further explanations ; (1) the great growth latterlj' in substitutes

--for duty-paying drinks- as of chicory for cofl'ee, starch for cocoa, and so forth;

(2) the enormous increa.se in recent years in the consumption of ' bottled waters.'

If we tax foods at all we should tax more especially those which are luxuries.
    In future years we shall probably continue to derive a considerable income from

the taxation of alcohol, but it will not be so large as that we now obtain. It does

not seem probable that this less income will be balanced by any absolutely eqiuva-
lent decrease in the crime and pauperism that become charges on the general revenue.
^Ve shall have in some other way to obtain at all events some increase from other

sources to balance the larger part of this falling oil".
638 EEPOKT-- 1882.

--within the six months renders it, in fact, a tcix of 8f^. instead of 5d. for the half-
--year an increase of 60 per cent.

    Were this principle applied to the 18,500,000/. raised on spirits, it would

-- --produce 5,500,000/. for the half-year. It must be admitted that this is an article of

luxury one that can be done without and therefore that its payment is entirely-
voluntary. It must also be borne in mind that at least one-half of the taxes
accruing from drink are expended by the State in preventinp-, punishintr, and
repairing evils the result of that drink being consumed ; so that on every con-
sideration the only limit to such taxation should be that which, being over-passed,
would encourage illicit manufacture or importation.

     Wine, which produces 1,300,000/., at present stands in a somewhat different
lio-ht, and when unfortified, is the most natural and least injurious of all intoxicating
liquors. Yet these duties are to be readjusted for political and economic reasons,
and in so doing might be fairly made to yield 500,000/. more, for at present the
alcohol in wine pays at the rate of aliout 6s. on the proof gallon, while spirit
pays 10s. It is quite right that alcohol .should be more highly taxed when produced

in a concentrated than in a diluted form.
     Beer partakes of the attribute of wine in its too low rating on the alcohol it

-- --contains only Is. 9(/. per gallon and to bring it up to a right proportion should

be at least doubled. Yet as the poor man's drink, and from long usage, it might
not be possible to do this at once, although it shoidd certainly be increased by
fifty per cent., or, for simplicity of calculation, from Gs. 3d. to 10s. per barrel, thus
raising some 4,500,000/. more.

     For various reasons these new or 'consumption duties ' should be charged on the
retailers, who are all licensed, and therefore under the surveillance of the autliorities.
It might be paid by them concurrently with or following upon the sale of the
articles, and their thus having realised their value. This is a somewhat novel
mode, but analogous to that of the income tax, which is not received until after
the income has been accrued and lias even been spent. The nature of the business
requires a supervision which in other trades would be deemed inquisitorial, and
which for its right conduct might well be combined with the collection of the
duties ; indeed tliere are many reasons why this double rating would be desirable in

the interests of the Revenue.

    From these several sources the whole income to the State from alcohol, which,
including licences, now exceeds 30,000,000/., would amotmt to some 14,000,000/.
more. This gives an average contribution by each individual of 8s. per annum, or

--say 21. for each family scarcely more than the price of a glass of beer per day for
--its head by omitting which he might save the increased tax. Or, to take another

illustration, seeing that on 120,000,000/. a year, which is estimated to be spent on
intoxicants, the 14,000,000/. would be but one-ninth more, the moderate drinker by
dispensing with this portion woidd only be making a fair sacrifice to tlie needs
of his country, whilst the excessive consumer would be greatly benefited by tliis

partial restriction in the extent of his potations.
      Whether, therefore, such a scheme should prove a financial success in raising

--the extra money allof whicli, it is probable, will be wanted for Egyptian outlay

or from the check it would gi^иe to consumption fail to yield thus much, it is every

way desirable. In tlie latter case it would achieve a moral success far outweighing

aU'disadvantages, really saving to tlie country that proportion of its income which,
though received with the one hand is disbursed with the other, to meet the results
of the very consumption which produces the revenue.

           3. The Influences of the Beer Duty. B)j H. Stopes, F.G.S.

    Two years' practical experience of the Beer Duty that replaced the Malt Tax

shows the direct gainers to be :
     1. The National Exchequer, Excise branch.
     2. The lowest section of the labouring classes, living in houses of a less value

than Б10 and Б15 per annum.
                           TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                                                                             639

    3. The sections of the community that gain profit from other material than malt
and sugar now used in brewing.

The direct losers are :

1. Farmers.

2. Brewers, especially small brewers for sale.

3. Maltsters.

Indirect losers :

Landowners and the numerous sections of tlie people who more or less directly

depend upon these losers.

Experience is insufficient to accurately estimate the gains and losses.

The points established are :

1. The present duty exceeds the old tax.
2. The loss presses heavily upon men ill able to bear it, tIz. farmers, smal

brewers, and maltsters.

3. The moral and social disadvantages of the Gs. and Qs. licences, and the de-

sirability of their suppression.

    4. The advantages of the ' free mash tun.'

     I. The present duty exceeds the malt tax by 2s. per quarter at least. Mr. Glad-
stone admits this, and it is more clearly shown by the Parliamentary returns moved

by Mr. "VViitney, giving details of the brewing trade to September 30, 1881.

     The old dutv amounted to 22a-. 8d. per quarter. The duty paid by all brewers

making over 100,000 bis. of beer exceeded 24s. per quarter. By the two largest
brewers it was 25s. Gd. per quarter. By tlie smallest it was 23s. Qid. This class

used 667,440  quarters   materials                                                         the  three  largest brewers used GUI ,038 quarters
                                                                                        ;

materials. The duty on the latter amounted to Б871,066 8s. Od., on the former to

Б792,718 15s. 3d. ; if the bullis of material were equal, then the large brewers would
pay Б50,277 Is. dd. more duty than the smaller ones. The apparent loss to the
revenue of Б02,000 per annum is accounted for by the material, exceeding 250,000

quarters, used by the 110,000 6s. and 9s. licence-holders, paying onlj- Б40,000 instead
of Б300,000 if material paid as much as formerly, and also by the decrease in beer

made last year upon the quantities brewed during the preceding six years.
    II. Farmers know now practically that the destruction of the monopoly in barley

has lowered the average price several shillings per quarter. No reasonable change

in the law can alter this excepting a return to the former regulations and malt duty.

Protective taritt's on maize, rice, and sugar will not effect it. This loss at a time of

depression is insupportable to many farmers.

     Small brewers are disappearing rapidly, and the whole trade is depressed. In

1880 there were--

--a remarkable loss, almost entirely of small brewers. Decreased volume of business

simply shifts back larger brewers a step lower. This diminution of inimbers is a
striking proof of losses to small brewers, caused by the beer duty adding directly to

their burdens, and the Gs. licences depriving them of manj^ lucrative customers, want
of knowledge being the primary cause. The materials used by the 14,948 small
brewers, if used by the three largest would have produced 166,360 bis. more beer,
giving a gross profit to Government of 60,277/. Is. Qd., and to the brewers of

                                                '

150,000/.

     Maltsters lose heavily also, but no statistics concerning them are now available.
    III. Class legislation is usually defective. Brewers now pay heavier duties.
Ignorant labourers entirely escape after using 2 bushels of malt ; they make very bad
beer duty free, and spoil much costly material. Tlie stimulus given to the truck

system is also pernicious. Scientifically, cottage brewing is a mistake. These
licences should be suppressed or material used by their holders should pay equally
with that under all other licences.
640 REPORT-- 1882.

     IV. Brewers witli a free mash tun can make better beer more scientifically at
less cost; natural laws regulating production prevent adulteration. Maize and rice
are not adulterants, beer brewed from tliem being identical with, and as pure as
malt beer. If the duty was reduced to its old level, the public would get better

beer at less cost than at present. If farmers succeed in securing the protective
mash tun, the advantages to themselves will equal those they have gained by the
repeal of the malt tax, and the general community will lose more.

4. The North Sea Fisheries. By 0. T. Olsen, F.B.A.S., F.E.G.S.

     The author, who has laboured among the fishermen of the North Sea for nearly

twenty years, clearly points out several very important facts in connection with

these fisheries. He describes by name forty different fishing-grounds, where all
kinds of marketable fish are caught. He also calls attention to a very extensive

oyster-ground nearly 200 miles in extent and from thirty to seventy miles in

breadth, containing inexhaustible oyster-beds, for which he recommends steam

trawlers or dredgers. Reference to the chart published by him will show the
situation of these fishing-grounds, and a very elaborate description of these banks is

given in his ' Fisherman's Seamanship.'

    With regard to the fish itself, where, when, and how caught, bait, food, when in
season, time of spawning, number of eggs, and the set of the tide in the North Sea,

this is graphically described in the Piscatorial Atlas, nearly ready for publication.

     The fishermen of the North Sea must be an intelligent class of men, with

a very clear conception of things pertaining to their trade, as their observa-

tions show, found in the log-book which Mr. Olsen, in conjunction with the

late Mr. Buckland, has sent out for the last three years. One fact may just

be mentioned as communicated by them. In one particular spot in the North

Sea they find fish more or less maimed or emaciated, and among them a very few

Nowsplendid healthy ones.  this is their idea : the locality is the hospital, the

healthy fish are the nurses, and the flora found there a specific for their ailments, or

Aan asylum from pursuit, in accordance with what is known of land animals. very

able description, regarding the depths of water and the nature of the bottom, fallowed,

over twenty different kinds of .soil being enumerated. Next, the author gave an

account of about fifty difl'erent kinds of marketable fish, caught by the trawl, and a

graphic history of this implement from its introduction to its present development.

Previous to railways the trawling trade was of very little importance, but the great

facility for the transport of fisli has contributed much to its present magnitude.

From open boats, of about ten tons, to modern smacks of from 80 to 100 tons, and

costing from 700/. to 1,500/., nay even some with refrigerators and screw trawlers,

costing up to 4,000/., is a great stride.

The fi.shing fleet of the United Kingdom numbers about 40,000 ve.ssels, carrying

about 150,000 men, be.sides boys. Particular statistics are given in the Fisherman's

Almanac.

     These brave fishermen of the North Sea, the author stated, would be of invalu-
able service for coast defence, and by his scheme could be organised and kept in a

    From the foregoing it will be seen that the author has a threefold object in view,
viz., the feeding of the nation, assistance to science, and the defence of this country.

     Taking the English tonnage engaged in the foreign trade at 0,000,000 tons in 1850,
and at 41,000,000 in 1880, he proceeded to consider what were the causes to which

the increase was due. These be referred to the general progress of the world, the
throwing open to commerce of the Pacific regions of China, Japan, California, &c.,

the colonization of New Zealand and parts of Australia, and the discovery of gold

in California and Australia. These events bad notbing to do with free trade or
fair trade, and it was essential to regard tlie real conditions for a right understand-
ing of them and the avoidance of misleading authorities. Another influence in
our favour had been the revolution by which timber and hemp, as constructive
materials of shipping, bad been replaced by iron and steel, the former being im-
ported from abroad, and the new materials, -with coal for working, being of home

production. In these materials too "we had an advantage over many countries.
Sailing vessels had been displaced by steam. It was a matter of moment in the
economic condition of the nation that home resources should be applied, and in the
residt this produced enormous advantages. Our duty -was to studj- all means bv

which our national wealth can be augmented under the most favourable condi-

tions.

--2. Our Sailors for Defence and Commerce. At Home and Abroad.

                            By C. Pfoundes, F.E.G.S.

As the great maritime nation of the age, it is necessary that we be prepared

for all emergencies, and fully able to protect our ships and our territories at home

and abroad.

     The separation between the seamen and officers of the navy and those of the
mercantile marine is widening year by year, in consequence of the special technical
training for all ranks in the navy. The naval reserve, merchant seamen, and

volunteer naval brigades are not encouraged or supported. The national love of
'a sailor's life' is not fully developed and taken advantage of; and the merchant
seaman is not rising in the social scale, but rather deteriorating physically and

otherwise.

Recent essays and discussions point more to the details of the education, &c.,

of the naval officer.  The  ' seaman                                           is  treated  as a very minor  matter ;  and the
                                                                            '

capacity of our colonies to furnish a large contingent of the very best material is

altogether ignored by the modern navy men.

     The thoroughly efficient, fully adequate, and economical provision of any requisite

number of seamen appears most necessary, from a practical standpoint, as seen by
one who has had personal experience amongst the classes that would give us the
raw material.

     History and statistics point out what should be copied and what avoided, whilst

fully considering the change in the condition of politics, society, ships and guns.

Although not so much a military as a maritime people, we have greatly encouraged

our rifle volunteers, but completely ignored, if not actually discouraged, naval

volunteers ; certainly in no way has a taste for sea life been "fostered amongst our
youths, and the time is not far distant when this negligence will produce disastrous

results. Second-rate powers are forming navies, that combined would prove dan-

gerous enemies, especially if allied to any ' great power ' we might be at war with.
Remote China, or Japan, or even a South American republic, might send to sea
vessels that would cause us Fevious trouble, if not actually inflict great injury on

our shipping or distant possessions.

     In the mother country and the colonies tliere are thousands of men who follow
a seafaring life, many men of means fond of boating and travelling, not a few men
who have been 'seafarers' at one period of their life. There are numbers of pen-
sioners, trained men capable of giving primary instruction; and there are tens of
thousands of young men on the seaboard and inland, who would be glad to 'volun-

teer/ if only this ' wealth of material ' were duly organised and received a fair meed
of support and encouragement here at home and in our colonies.

      Wages and other sources of income, and considering how far it is con-

   --sonant ivith the economic progress of the United Kingdom. See Reports,

       p. 297.

               2. The Abstract Theory of Bent. J??/ F. T. Edgeworth.

     The writer attempts to present the Ricardian theory as a first approximation,
at once requiring and required by a more accurate statement.

     Let a line, o.v, represent by its parts the quantities of land of each quality. Let
perpendiculars thereto represent amounts of labour and sacrifice expended upon
land. On each unit rectangle of the plane, .ry, erect a rectangular parallelepiped

proportional to the corresponding ainount of produce. Then the total produce may

be conceived as gathered into a barn of a peculiar shape. The highest point is the
rectangular comer, o. From this point the height of the straight walls, o.v and oy,
gradually diminishes down to a certain minimum height, i. The extremities of

these straight walls are connected bj' an outer wall, in general curvilinear or stair-

shaped, of the same minimum height. The figure is completed by a sloping roof.

A level floor, of height i, separates off a loft containing the landlord's portion of

the total produce. The rest of the building may be divided by another level floor

into two storeys, containing the portions of the capitalist -farmers and labourers

respectively.

     Now, the total contents being unaltered, let the roof be raised. The height of
the outer wall vnW be increased, the contents of the loft will be diminished. Again,

the roof being prolonged, but not otherwise altered, let the total contents be in-

creased. The lieight of the outer wall being diminislied, the contents of the loft will
be increased. Let both roofs be raised and total contents correspondingly increased,

the contents of the loft will be increased. And so forth.

     Of course these metaphorical statements are but grossly approximate. It is not
possible to arrange lands as Nos. 1, 2, and 3, according to their productivity ; for
productivit}^, being a relation between produce and expenditure, maj^, for one land
as compared with another, be greater or less according to the difi'erent amounts of

expenditure considered. Accorduigly, the yz curves of our roof are not necessarily

parallel. One may start at a great height, and descend rapidly, another begin low,

and decline gently. Thus greater expenditure need not correspond to greater rent.
This liolds not only as between difi'erent lands, but also the same land under dif-
ferent cultivations. If, owing to improved cultivation, the same total produce is
raised with less expenditure, rents need not be lowered ; even money-rents may be
raised. Again, though the return to the last dose of capital will be just what the
farmer could have obtained elsewhere by investment without trouble of manage-
ment, yet the return to his whole farming capital will not be in the same proportion,
but rather regulated by the condition that he cannot with advantage transfer himself
and his capital to any other business.

     These and other exceptions, suggested mostly by Ilicardo himself and his disciples,
are calculated rather to fulfil than destroy the Ricardian rule. The abstract theory
is as it were a type-photograph of the di\ersified real forms. It is an approximation

not only near to, but on the only way to, the full truth. Those who now sneer at
the great discoverer, forget that witliout his general map they would never have

found out the region of their petty explorations.

     3. The Eicardo Theory of Bent. By Alfred Milnes, M.A., F.8.S.

     Various weak points may be observed in the Ricardo theory as generally stated

--and applied : that great difficulty is experienced by skilled economists in main-

taining their self-consistency with regard to it, as evidenced (e.^.) by certain
                                                                                                                      TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                                                                                       643

--mistakes made by Nassau Senior that it is isolated from the complex of social

--phenomena that it does violence to the ordinary use of language, and thus excites

distrust in the ordinary mind. This feeling is of importance, and justifies another

attempt to restate the theory of rent, to which end the statements given hitherto

must be classified. The Physiocrats may be omitted, as standing apart from our

purpose, and a cyclic tendency in the teaching of some of our leading modern

economists will enable the classification of ' post-physiocratic ' rent theories to be

on an historical fundament U7n divisionis, and four periods will be yielded: 1.

--a starting-point, the journey is very short to what it is hoped may tend to a com-

pletion of rent-theory rent explained by reference to the Law of Equal Inducement

to all employments. This law has a simple diagrammatic representation. Sundry

anomalous payments may thus be brought under rent.

      Bij Professor Silyanus P. Thompson, B.A., D.Sc.

The author referred to his paper on ' Apprenticeship Schools in France,' read iu

this Section in 1879, as giving information and statistics on the manual elementary

schools, the factory schools, and the apprenticeship schools of France, which the recent

preliminary report of the Royal Commission on Technical Education has described.

The author claimed that no single new fact had been brought out by the report of

the Commissioners, beyond the information that by a recent law it had been decreed

that the education in such scliools, as in all primary schools in France, should be

gratuitous, and that manual training was now added to thirty primary schools in

Paris. Reference was made to these manual schools as constituting' a very im-

portant extension of the Kindergarten system of teaching. The author advocated

the introduction of                         manual                                                                    training into  primary schools                                                                the  making of  primary

          --1. Bailways a Plea for Unity of Administration.

                             By Edward J. Watherston.

     The author stated that the British railway system had lately been considered
by a Select Committee of the House of Commons, and already there was a demand
for a new trial, on the ground that the verdict was against the evidence. Certain
it was thatthe report of the Select Committee could not be accepted as a settle-
ment of so important a question, so weak were the conclusions at which they had
arrived. To science tlie nation was indebted for the principle of steam-propelled
trains, and now to science they must look for the administration of those under-

takings._ He summarised the complaints of the public and the replies of the

companies. The Committee simply recommended that chambers of commerce and
of agriculture should liave a locus sfcmdiheiove the Railway Commission ; a uniform
classification of goods ; the recognition of terminal charges ; additional powers to
the Railway Commission ; the abandonment of canal control by railway companies;
and, lastly, the amalgamation of the railways of Ireland by direct Parliamentary
action. Sucli recommendations, if acted upon, would only make confusion woife
confounded. If unity of administration were desirable in the case of Ireland, it
was still more desirable in the case of Great Britain. Looked at superficially, the
number of 023,000,000 passengers carried in one year might seem large, but it was

                                                                      TT2

REPORT 1882.

really not so if the figures were properly analysed. The same argument applied to

goods traffic. Two hiuidred and forty-tive millions of tons was a bigh-soundiDg
figure, but when analysed the amount was but small. Were the railway's, as at

present administered, fairly remunerative to the shareholders ? The answer must
be in the negative. The average dividend for the entire United Kingdom was only
4'2y per cent. Hundreds of undertakings paid no dividend at all. The prevailing

system was not altogether without its advantage to a section of the travelling

public. No country in the world could show trains performing the journey from

London to Edinburgh, 401 miles, in less than ten hours. Certainlj' in no other
countrj' could one travel 108 miles in two linurs and a quarter, as was the
case daily on the Great Western between London and Batli. Another advantage,
although it was difHcult to perceive any real national benefit accruing from such
waste of power, was to be found in the fact that every morning and evening the
traveller for the North had a choice of three different half-empty trains, all mag-
nificently equipped, starting about the same time, and running at the rate of about

fifty miles an hour, from Euston, St. Pancras, and King's-cross. Competition, it
was said, was good for trade and good for the public. But here one failed to see
 any beneficial result, inasmuch as the three companies had adopted tlie principle of
' unity of administration ' as to the amount of their charges. In reality, not the
shareholders, but the public, must in the end pay for wastefubiess and improvidence
in railway management ; the loss must be recouped by placing ' the million ' under
 contribution, taxing them in the shape of exorbitantly high fares. This was
 systematically done by all our railway companies. Foremost among the disad-

vantages must be reckoned the disastrous effect upon trade. At present our

 manufacturers are handicapped in competition with foreigners by the excessive

 rates for the inland carriage of goods, and by the cost of commercial travelling.

We --hear of rents badly paid, and of no rents at all of farms even out of culti-

 vation. And yet there may be food at one end of a line of railway wanting

 mouths, and mouths at the other end wanting food, and it does not pay to bring

 the one to the other. Eccentricities of charges are observable on all classes of

 produce. The application of the principle of unity of administration, with the

 consequent lowering of rates and fares, would tend to equalise the value of landed
 property all over the kingdom. With cheap transi)ort, the price of all commodities

-- -- mfood in particular would naturally sink enormously, favour of the consumer,

 whereas its value to the producer would as assuredly rise. It is simply incalculable

 what the increase in value of landed property, removed from large centres of
 population, would be if railways were organised like the Post Office. Railways
 have doubled the value of many an estate, and they would quintuple it if they ceased
 to be matters of private speculation, and were managed in the interest of the

--nation. The advantages to the public include: 1. The possibility of a general

 lowering of charges both for goods and passentjers. Millions who now do not

 travel for want of means, would then come to fill the trains. That it would pay

 to carry these milhons is quite certain. 2. The suppression, as far as possible, of
 what are called ' accidents.' Mismanngement is the cause of nearly all of them.
 In tbe single year 1880, the number of persons lulled on the railways of the United
 Kingdom was 1,135, while the wounded numbered 3,959. Of this total, 546 killed

 Aand 2,080 wounded were railway servants. 3. greatly improved system of

  postal ssrvices. If all our railways were imder unity of administration every
 station coidd easily be turned also into a post office, when every train coidd be

  accompanied by a travelling postal carriage for the sorting of letters as well as of
  parcels. Tbe progress of internal trade and the movement of population thus

  originated would probably not be less than tliat produced by the introduction of
 the railways themselves, when superseding the old stage coaches. 4. The position

 of shareholders woidd be improved. It must be remembered tliat we are dealing

  with a business yielding a gross return of GGi millions sterling ; that the net

 divisible profits now amount to nearly 32 millions that, imder unity, large
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

of ' loans and dehentures ' an enormous saving in interest would he etlected, seeing

that a railway trust could borrow at 3 to Si per cent., instead of 4, 5, and 6, and

even 7 per cent., as prevails under the present system. It would matter but little

to proprietors whether income were derived from a 3 or 3i per cent. ' consol

stock, or from a 16i per cent. ' Tatf Yale ' stock, and if it were guaranteed, as

shown by the late flutter among water shareholders, an enormous rise would take

place in the money value of such income. Moreover, there are the proprietors of

46 millions of unremunerative capital to be considered. Nothing can be more

clear than that these undertakings should be treated as bankrupt concerns, and

sold for the benefit of creditors. They should be valued, and taken over by the

' Railway Trust ' at their fair valuation. There should be one central government

of all the lines, with the service so arranged as to meet the utmost public con-

venience. The end kept in view should be to assimilate on the same principle the

transport of letters, of telegraph messages, of persons, and of merchandise.

       2. Cottagers and Open Wastes in the District of the New Forest.
                       By G. E. Briscoe Etee (a Verderor.)

     The subject of ' Cottage stock-keeping in connection with commonable lands *
is not pecuUar to the district, but is probably more largely exemplified here than
elsewhere in the South of England.

This subject does not lend itself readily to statistical treatment for various reasons.

The cottagers are exceedingly reserved, and information is difficult to obtain ; besides,
few of them keep accounts, and the method pursued and its results vary somewhat

with the seasons and depend greatly upon the individuality of the cottager, upon

his resources and his circumstances. But, considering the high average of success

attained, these very difficulties stimulate me to draw attention to the subject, in

the hope that some experienced economist may write hereafter the chapter of which

this paper is a first rough draft. For, so far as I can learn, the value of common

rights to the exercisers and the method of their exercise is but imperfectly under-

stood, and yet some economic counterpoise is sorely needed to the prejudice with

which  the  '  commoner                                                      is  too  often regarded.                                                                                The cottager-commoner is termed
                                                                '

contemptuously a ' squatter,' although in many cases his freehold, copyhold, or
lifehold tenement may date from Saxon times, and although his common rights,

often a relic of our Saxon liberties, may be as trulv his property as the soil of the

wastes whereby he largely lives is the property of the Crown or of the lord of tlie
manor. Few landlords, land agents, or land stewards and the like, seem to regard

a ' cornmoner                                                                even with tolerance,  and fewer                                                                         still seem  to   have  considered his
                                                                          '

value in the national economy. In particular, a just and inteUigeut consideration

of such commoners has too often been hickiug in past times amongst those who

have deemed it their interest or their duty to promote the inclosure of commonable

lands. For instance, it has been thought just that a common should be en-

closed, provided the present owner of common rights could be induced to barter

the right which woidd otherwise have benefited successive generations, for some

small allotment in land. But as the exercisers of common rights well know,

<and the allottees have too often experienced, the parts of an extensive and varied

waste when thus assigned in severalty, are never an equivalent to the small hus-

bandman for his share in a joint enjoyment of the whole. And a valuable property

(or legal estate) is thus partly sacrificed, or made easy to squander, and in practice

is found to disappear very shortly by absorption into large estates.

In default of a sufficient perception of the lesser interests involved, open lands

have often been enclosed only to prove a complete disappointment to the owner of
the soil, and injurious to the- true interests of the immediate neighbom-hood and

sometimes even of the country at laro-e.

The present paper is an attempt to unfold those lesser interests, and in it I pro-

pose first to sketch in outline the region of the New Forest and the adjacent com-

monable wastes ; and, secondly, to show how these wastes are used, and to give some

specimens of the results.

   A great forestal region, co-extensive with the peninsula or irregular parallelogi'am

which narrows northwards from a base upon the Channel to the chalk downs of

"Wiltshire, forms the south-west section of the county of Southampton. It is bounded

by tlie river Avon on the west, by the sea on the south, and on the east by the

Southampton Water, and by the Hampshire or lower portion of the valley of the

Test, as far as its northern boundary. The New Forest occupies the greater

part of this area. Regarded as a whole, this region is an undulating heathy

waste, sloping east and south-east from ' plains ' of about 400-250 feet eleva-

tion above the sea, and having an axis generally parallel Avith the valley of the

Avon. From this axis long level ridges radiate and finally descend, with a more or

less rounded outline, into- a broad e.xpanse of flat ' heaths ' which extends to the

sea, averaging about 100 feet above sea-level. The surface of the region, a deposit

of gravel upon the Jjarton clays, has been denuded until the water-bearing Braclesham

beds and hungry Bagshot sands are laid bare, and only gravel-capped ridges and

i.solated hills remain to attest its former character and gradual slope. The spurs

of these ridges enclose basins of horse-shoe form or elongated, and varying in

diameter, each comprising a series of convergent valleys hollowed out by the sur-

face-water, and deepened and broadened at about the 100-feet contour by the outflow

of the underground water. Thus the soil of the present surface varies from

gravel to clays and sand, as the denudation has extended downwards.

The area of the highest and of the lowest lauds being for the most part un-

cultivable, the cultivated or more or less wooded lands are found extended as pro-

montories or islanded as hills between the gravelly heaths above or the sandy heaths

Abelow.  few low-lying bottoms owe an exceptional fertility to a kind of alluvial

deposit from above, and contain the precious 'lawns;' and in particidar, great

morasses or lesser bogs fill the hollows of the sandy heaths, and are covered with

coarse mai-shy vegetation. Accordinglj^, we find the majority of the ancient farms

and demesne lands of the Forest or the adjacent manors situated in elevated locali-

ties between the 200 and 100 feet contours of the new Ordnance Map, while the

upper and lower heaths surrounding these oases and the woodland between form

the wastes, upon which the inhabitants from time immemorial have exercised their

rights of turbary, pannage, and of pasture. Here and there, some brown hamlet

on high ground, or a stray cottage with its little plot and orchard, nestling in some

sheltered hollow or skirting the roadside, varies the uniformity of the heaths.

It is with the value of these wastes, at first sight so unpromising, that we are

now concerned. Comparatively modern encroachments and inclosiires excepted,

they are what they were centuries ago while they were yet the favourite lumting-

grounds of our kings, or were accumidatlng in the hands of the great religious

--houses. The kings discouraged all change in the interest of the royal beasts of the

Forest ^the wolf, the red and fallow deer, badgers, &c. ; and abbots and abbesses

rather encouraged than otherwise the small copyhold tenants, who paid a timely

though insignificant rent in fat capons at Christmas.

It was probably due to the predominance of the Crown that the general move-

ment towards inclosiu'e, with its attendant hardships and disturbances, which cid-

minated in the reign of Edward VI., was little felt in this region. This movement,
which called forth the denunciation of Bishop Latimer and others, led in many other

districts to the destruction of the very class of cottage farmers of whom I am about

to speak. But that a newcomer sometimes tried to ' make lus profit ' of the wastes

appears from a decree of Elizabeth's reign, declaring and confirming the rights of

eleven small copyholders (amongst other customs) to pasture their cattle upon the

wastes of two manors adjacent to the New Forest. Their bill of complaint against
WiUiam Pawlett, lord of the manors of Wigley and of Cadnam and Winsor, recites

graphically that ' the said complaynants were poore coppieholders of the Manor of

Cadnam and Winsor, and their whole estates and livynge depended upon the same,

800 that yf they should be abrydged of there anncyent customes it would be their

utter undoinge.'
TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.  647

    In the New Forest, a hundred years later, a Imiited power was granted to the

Crown, by Act of Parliament, to enclose a portion of the wastes for the growth of
ship-timber ; but tlie Act jealously protected the commoners whose petitions against
the Bill describe the Forest as immemorially ' a great nursery for breeding cattle,'
and speak of ' many thousands ' as ' dependent ' on their rights of ' pasture, turbary,
and pannage ' in it. The Act provided that the land to be enclosed should be that
only which could be ' best spared from the commons and highways,' and provided
further, that the inclosiu-es should be again thrown open to pasture so soon as the
trees should be past injury by cattle.

     Thus did the Court of Chancery and Parliament protect the poor in 1591 and
1698 in the Forest and the manors. The lord had' not in those days, as practically
he has had in the nineteenth century, for his one-sixteenth of ownership hfteen-
sixteenths of the law ; it was not necessary, when the value of rights of common
were generalh' understood, to spend thousands of pounds sterling in appealing to the
Court of Chaucery for protection, nor years in agitation, and weeks in committee-

rooms to get a hearing from Parliament. And so, injurious inclosure was arrested
until the beginning of the nineteenth centurj-. As only a small fraction of the

surface was worth cidtivating, and as crafty attempts to sow the wastes with timber
for the benefit of the lord failed, because the Scotch fir, the most modern engine of
such encroachments, was either unknown or not procurable, these wastes remained

mxmtil within living memory statu quo. The bogs, the brook-side, and the swampy

' lawns,' continued to provide the cattle of the commoners with pasture ; the heaths
furnished turf for fuel and ashes for their land, and the shaggy imtended woods
yielded beech-mast and acorns for their pigs, and timber for fuel and for the repairs

of house, hedge, and implement.
     Before passing on to show the use and value of the several rights of common,

attention should perhaps be drawn to some elements which make this region a type

of what commonable pasture-land should be. It combines an extended range with

considerable variety of soil and of water-supplj", and with, perhaps, every variety

of shelter and exposure. Any deficiency in one section, especially in running water,

is supplied by sufficiency or excess in another ; constant change of ground (essential
to success in stock-management) is ensured, being caused by the seasons, by the
weather, and by the instinct of the animals, which, further, in seeking food, and
a suitable soil under foot, find healthy exercise. The importance of an extended

range is especially seen from the rarity of those exposed ponds, or wet, or even dry,

spots called ' shades,' indispensable in smnmer, where a local draught in a treeless
expanse relieves the animals of the flies. Driven from the woods and sheltered

 grounds, the animals then travel for miles ' to shade,' as the term is. Lastly, the

' turn out ' in winter and spring has a real value, due partly to the mildness of the
winters, snow being rare and never lying long partly to the early feed of the swamps

-- --and bogs, at its best when the meadows are parched with drought and partly to

the accessibility of healthy ground when the meadows lie cold and swampy with

 the winter rains.

     The foregoing description roughly indicates the peculiar advantages secured to
this sectiou of the county by the preservation of these open spaces. Let us now see
how these advantages operate, and with what results. To speak generally, the
 region is characterised by a moderate but widespread prosperity, even in these hard
 times, and by a low percentage of pauperism ; indeed, the prosperity of the lower

 strata of the agricultural population is prominent, especially that of small tenant-

 farmers and of the cottagers, and this can be distinctly traced to the judicious

 exercise of common rights. For the larger the fiirm, the less is the use made of the
wastes. The land of the farms is of better quality, and the proportion of meadow

 is probably sufficient ; the improved breeds of stock are too delicate to turu out
 upon the wastes, the tenant's capital is in most cases fully employed upon the

 farm, and his attention absorbed in an increasingly elaborate business. I3ut the

 wastes are the cottager's farm ; they are the soiurce of his livelihood, or of his
 comforts, and of his capital. So he makes it his business to acquire the proper

 stock, and to work the commons to the best advantage. For such reasons, and
 because the simplicity of the cottager's life and business enables the eflect of com-
648 hepoet-- 1882.

mon rights to be traced witli some accuracy and definiteuess, tlie purview of tliis

paper will be limited to this class.

    The chief rights comprise common of turbary and (iu the Forest) of fuel wood

--appurtenant to the ancient houses, and common of pannage and of pasture appur-

tenant to the land. There are other rights, viz., of taking marl (for manure), gravel,

and  sand                      but the very ^'aluable  immemorial  custom  iu the  Forest of  taking  fern
                            ;

for litter was lost in 1854, partly through mismanagement, partly through the

hostility of the representatives of the Crown. The right of cutting litter has been

recently disputed by the Grantee of the Crown, Earl Delawarr, in Ashdown Forest,

in Sussex ; and the decision of the present Lord Coleridge and his two fellow^ Com-

missioners in 1854 against the commoners of the NevA Forest was alleged, but, not-

withstanding, the right was upheld by the Courts after extensive litigation. In

the New Forest, the fern is sold by the Office of Woods, but under conditions

generally considered to be prohibitive ; it is bought chiefly from necessity. Now,

the cottagers buy leaves, the sedge-grass of the woods, &c., for litter, straw being

scarce and expensive, though none of these make-shifts at all make up for the loss

of the fern.

     The right of turbary sometimes, i.e. in the manors, includes peat ; the so-called

' turf ' consists of disks of heather with the roots and adhering humus, pared hori-

zontally from the gravelly and pastureless soils ; it is burned on the hearth with a

little wood, and makes a slow and economical hre. The ashes are much valued for

Athe garden and farm.          turf-right averages 4,000 turves per house, and, being

eked out with a few faggots or a little stump-wood, formerly kept a family in fuel

througli the winter. Nowadays the use of coal is on the increase. The value

of the i-ight is roughly reckoned at 10s. to IZ. a year.

     The right of fuel-wood from the Forest averages a load to a cottage, and

farms sometimes have a good deal more. Tliese wood-rights, being costly to the

Office of Woods, were keenly contested in 1854. Their value depends largely upon

the distance from home at which the wood is assigned.

     The right of pannage varies in value with the season, and with the commoner's

power to take advantage of a good mast-time. Tlie cottager who has saved a few

pounds, observing the promise of beech-mast and acorns, buys in early and cheap

as many pigs as lie can hope to keep until September 25, or he buys a good-sized

pig or two just before that date. He then turns them out on payment of 4d for

a hog and 2d. for a pig, and they return bettered to the value of about 10s. to 20s.

a-head, and fit for immediate sale. In a good season 5/. thus laid out may be

doubled iu three months ; but on the average of seasons a clear profit of 10s. per

pig accrues on a number of pigs of all sizes. Perhaps the cottager's pig benefits

most by a good mast, for the children collect large quantities of acorns along the

roads and from the manorial lands, and after the pig has been taken in these are

given to him with other food, and thus the mast can be made in all to save 21.

in food. The acorns are the better for a little keeping. Some cottagers adopt this

method as soon as the mast begins to run short. At present the cheapness of

food in proportion to the price of pig meat increases the profit of keeping pigs.

Cottagers have been known to make 201. a year by their pigs.

     But it is the right of pasture which is of paramount importance. It gives a

wide scope to enterprise, slall, and thrift ; and while the expenses out of pocket are
small, a modest capital can be accumulated (either by hard work and rigid economy

in early life, or by the co-operation of a helpful family in later life), and a high rate

of interest be obtained legitimately. An admirable investment is alw^ays ready

to hand, and sometimes a family owes its first ]start to a windfall applied to stock-

keeping ou the wastes. From this right the most widespread benefit arises. The

aged and the widow may make a bare livelihood and preserve their honourable

aversion to parish relief; the shrewd and care fid labourer may become gradually

independent of work, and may even raise himself into the ranks of the tenant-

farmers. There are labourers of these districts who are better off, all things con-
sidered, tlian many a skilled artisan earning full wages in London. Indeed, many
a young man before leaving home has a colt or mare running on the open wastes,

or possibly even two mares, before he is of age. As forest mares often breed yearly,
TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                                              649

and yearlings fetch from 41. 10s. to G/. at the August fairs, and as pony stock can

be wintered on the farms at from Is. Gd. to Is. a week, and 6f/. for suckers, the

ownership is both cheap and profitable. The care of a troop of five costs little

more than the care of a single animal, and such a troop with average good luck

brings in 20/. a year. Ponies are not wintered nor cared for imless they begin to

stray and leave the Forest. And now that the winter-heyning is practically abo-

lished, ponies begin to stay out longer. The cost of wintering is thus reduced by

10s. to 4s. per head. The ponies are habituated to some locality, and are left to

themselves, being driven in only for marking by the agister, or when wanted for

sale, so that they cost the owners nothing but the marking fees of Is. Gd. a head

per annum. The fillies are usually left at large ; they run with the mares, and in

their fourth year breed a good colt. Brood mares are much valued, and rarely

sold a very good one will fetch 15/. Heifers are less costly to buy, say 21. to il.,
                         ;

and are nearly as self-maintaining as pony stock, until they have their first calf;

but they need better pasture, and they cost about \s. per week more if wintered.

In the spring, they may be sold with calf at side for 10/. to 14/. each. But the

cottager's ambition is to own a cow. In one case, quoted below, the calf was ac-

quired as a weanhng seven days old, costing 10s., and was paid for out of its own

milk two and a half years afterwards. In another, a heifer was bought for about

--21., and paid for from its own butter a year or two after it came to maturity. No

trouble, shift, or economy is spared first to obtain, and then to rear the future

cow. Nothing is wasted, and even the furze-tops are gathered in winter, and cut

--up with the other food. The residt is that almost every cottager owns some

animal at least a forest mare or a heifer, if not both a cow and a pig, each of

which makes the other more profitable.

It is estimated by our cottagers and small farmers that, if there were no wastes,

a minimum of -3 acres of our forest meadows would be required to keep a single

cow, i.e. an acre for hay and 2 acres for the usual little crops of mangel, &c., and

to be used for pasture alternate^. The rent of such a 3-acre lot would not be less

than 4/., and might be considerably more. But with the use of the wastes, the

usual house-plot of 2 or 3 roods, if a good cow common adjoin, will support a
%single cow, except in a winter of exceptional severity. The cow lives
                                                                        the

common from May to November, while two crops of hay are secured from the

heavily manured orchard, and a good after-grass is growing ; but everyone who

can afibrd to do so will give the cow a little something nightly. An expenditure

of 2s. to 2s. Qd. per week in winter on hay, swede-turnips, and pollard, and on

the materials for a mash (to the amount of about oOs. to 3^.) will increase the

average weekly produce of butter throughout the year by one-half, say, from 3 lbs.

to 5 lbs. per week. This butter is sold at the gate for Is. 2d. a lb. on the average.

Cases occur where a small capital of about 10/. wiU enable a second cow to be kept on

the house-plot and common by the purchase of additional food. The calf will he

sold at six weeks old for about 10s. profit, and all the skim milk will then go to

fatten the pig. Each pig bought, fatted, and sold at about four-score weight may

produce in six or eight weeks a profit of Is. per week up to 10s., and with high

feeding will produce a little more ; but the value of the pig has lain, until lately,

rather in the fact that he helps to turn everything to use and provides a valuable
manure. Of course the number bought and sold annually will depend on cir-

cumstances, capital, and on the mast-time. Widows and such-like owners of a

single cow often kill and salt a joig, the cost of which may be cheapened by about

a third if there is a good mast. The profits of a house-plot and single cow, with
its complement of pigs, may be estimated at from 4s. to 10s. per week, according

to the means and opportunities of the cottager, and, speaking roughly, it is

probable that our labourers not unfi-equently earn the double of their weekly

wages by such stock-keeping as the foregoing. If an acre or 1| acre of mead(5w

can be added, there will probably be two cows and a sow, and two or three fatting

pigs on the premises. As before, the cows are 'turned out' while the hay is grow-

mming, and will maintain themselves entirely on the co on from May until Novem-

ber. The wife's spare time suffices for the management of two cows and the corre-

sponding number of pigs ; meanwhile the husband is earning regular wages abroad.
--650 EEPORT 1882.

and easily obtains an occasional day to get in the all-important hay crops of his

orchard and mead, or to empty the rude outbuilding and spread its contents upon

his little holding. With the third cow, expenses out of pocket begin. Few wives
can now manage without a boy to help, and the husband, obliged to be more and

more at home, must substitute task work for day work. Or he will set up a pony

--and cart and begin dealing first, as a higgler, or dealer in butter, eggs, poultry,

and garden produce, which he buys of the cottager and sells in the market town

and later, as a general dealer on a larger scale. He employs his spare time in

carting turf, fuel, wood, chalk, &c., for his neighbours at 5s. a ton. But the

middleman's business is not without its di-awbacks, and the careful housewife

regards with some anxiety the social habits aud long absences which it involves.

The next and most important stage is reached when the cottager can rent about

five acres of meadow and stock it with three or four cows, a couple of sows, and

can rear a heifer and sell two calves, and fat 10 to 12 pigs yearly. An advance

beyond this point will involve hired labour, unless the children are well-grown and

helpful. Here the cottager often hesitates, for the thrifty stop short of hiring

labour. Probably he has reached the limit of his out-buildings and of his power

to winter stock. But if he advance, the next stage is a 'little place' of 8 to 12
acres, and the man having then become practically a tenant-farmer, passes out of

the limits of this paper.

By the foregoing details the use and value of these wastes and of the rights

Weover them will have been indicated generally.                                may now try to trace the

financial results. Precise financial results wiU hardly be expected, for the two
livelihoods of the cottager, viz., the ordinary and that arising out of his common

rights, must intermingle inextricably. But by isolating the stock-keeping and

then separating oft' the actual monetary transactions in that branch, results of

approximate accuracy may be obtained, and the value of the whole be inferred

from the profits of a part. The following table, the result of much consultation

with competent cottage stock-keepers, shows the approximate profits on each head

of stock ; and anyone desirous of pursuing the subject further will find, the author

believes, that by applying this as a standard to any given head of cottager's stock

for a given time he will not overrate the profits actually realizable. The amoimts

are small in themselves, but large when compared with a labourer's weekly wage.

They show a large percentage on the outlaj% but the laljour and superintendence

are not charged                                                                the stock-keeping is regarded as added to the cottager's living.
                                                                            ;

-- --quart amounted to 39^. 18s. 6d. The profits on tlie pigs fatted largely on bought

food and sold at about live score weights-- amounted to 21/. 14s. 9d.

    The year's net profits therefore amounted to 61/. 13s. 3d. The maximum profit

made by this cottager in any year was 771, 5s. lid., and the ininimum 59/., say 10/.

an acre.

There is reason to believe that a few other cottagers, "nathout this man's

special experience, may be as good managers, but his experience iu keeping accounts
is unusual, and these may be regarded as trustworthy.

    The general results may be summed up brieflj'. Tlie cottager lives the life of

a labourer, but his earnings are those of a farm of about tin-ice the size, and twice

the rent of his little holding. The cow provides a weekly, the pig a quarterly,

and the heifer or pony an annual income, whicli can be reinvested in the business,

which the cottager thoroughly understands, at a good or even very high interest.

The effect on character in forming habits of industry and thrift is obvious, and

experience shows that it is generally permanent. Financially, also, the result

seems to be permanent, notwithstanding a stroke of ill luck or a bad season

or two. Baulcruptcy in this class is, as far as I can learn, unknown. Neither

does the cottager fall a prey to the money-lender. Lately, 1 was examining the

court rolls of a manor adjoining the Forest, and, between 1700 and 18:^5, I

observed that the old copyhold families were slowly dispossessed by the money-

lender (often the brewer of the market towny with melancholy sureness and

uniformity, and 1 observed also that in their turn, the new names which came in

as mortgagees went out as mortgagors.

It remains to deal with two points mentioned at the outset of this paper, viz.,

the opportunity which cottage-farming in connection with common rights opens to

the labourer to better his position, and the comparative absence of pauperism where

the sj'stem has full scope.

llegret is often expressed, on various grounds, at the disappearance of the

British yeoman. But in the region under consideration he survives, and the cot-

tage-commoner is the source whence this ancient link between the labourer and the

gentleman is maintained.

    The way in which the stepping-stones are provided may be illustrated by
examples. [The author quoted instances within his own knowledge, in which

labourers and others have risen into the class of tenant-farmers and small pro-

prietors.] But perhaps the most intelligible and indisputable proof of the value

of these open spaces and common rights is the comparative absence of pauperism in

the region.

It has been shown that not only can the commoners make a reasonable pro-

vision against illness and old age, but that the modest smn which might not out-

last the long and hale old age of this healthy region, if applied to daily necessities,

is either saved or invested in stock-keeping, and so made to produce a fairly steady

and sufficient pittance. Old people of reasonably active habits, or with a little

help if infirm, can keep at least a single cow, and profiting by the experience of a

lifetime may earn more than the parish could allow iu outdoor relief. The statis-

Atics of pauperism show that these ' chances ' are used to the fuU.  typical parish

may be taken from the nine parishes of the New Forest Union which embraces

the eastern and larger half of the district under review. The half-yearly return

(to Michaelmas 1881) for Bramshaw, a typical parish as to size and position, con-

taining 823 souls, and surrounded by the wastes of the Forest and wastes of the

manors, shows that it has only three in-door and eleven out-door paupers, and an ex-

penditure of 4G/. 8s. Q\d., but there is an exceptional expenditure of about one-

fourth (8/. 3s. 7d.) due to the bankruptcy and death of a considerable tenant-farmer

with a large family, so that we may fairly reckon the out-door relief at 38/. 6s., i.e.

at 76/. 10s. a year. For the AViltshire section, there are no indoor paupers, and

only three outdoor ; for the Hampshire section, in which a few low-class and
modern cottages have not the ordinary garden and orchard, there are three in-

door and eight outdoor paupers. The published details show that this relief is

given to cases of old age with infirmity, and to widows with famUies. But,
without making any deduction, the amount is about 9 per cent, on the population

                                                                                         I
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.  653

and less than | per cent, on the rateable value, and ]3rf. per acre of land other
than wastes.

    And if proof be required that this result is larp^ely due to the prudent exercise
of common rig'hts, the evidence of one of the relieving otHcers of the Union, given
before a Committee of the House of Lords in 1875, may be alleged to show that
the inclosure of common lands'within the Forest or in the adjacent manors, affected

immediately the local prosperity of the population, and was especially felt by the
neighbouring cottagers who owned cows. The tenor of his evidence can be borne
out by other, and amounts to this, that those who kept a single cow previous to
an inclosure could after it no longer keep any, and those who had kept two could
only keep one. The further fact that the etfect was rather seen in diminished
livelihoods and comfort than in actual admissions to the workhouse, is an important

testimony to the extent of the advantages conferred by these open wastes.
     In conclusion, if I have at all succeeded in making out the case propounded at

the outset, I would, with your permission, look a little into the future and submit

one further point, appealing to you, not so much as lovers of justice, but as prac-

tical economists.

     The fact will have struck many of you in visiting our district that the Scotch
fir is rapidly overgrowing our waste lands. You are iiware that the self-sown

natiu-al timber is the property of the lord of the soil, but will not perhaps be aware

how fatal this lir is to pasture of any kind, or to what an extent the self-sowing

of the Scotch lir is a recognised engine of legal encroachment. But if such com-
moners and common rights as I have endeavoured to describe are worth maintain-
ing, should this method of abolishing both, literally by a side wind, be permitted

to continue?

     I once saw, when in the company of two learned members of the legal pro-

fession, many cartloads of fir-cones lying outspread on waste ground of the New
Forest, to ' self sow ' it with fir. No fir-trees grew within a mile in any direction.

It is also notorious that old trees, long since fit for cutting, in the edges of plan-
tations, are seeding wastes fiir and wide, with or without the knowledge of the

owner of the trees. To what extent is this practice reconcileable with the funda-
mental law of property, viz., that a man may not use his property to the injury of

the property of another ?

                           By Don Artdro de Marcoartu.

     It is said that the British Commercial Marine is worth 230 millions sterling
that every year are lost 100 British ships and 1,600 lives. The author would not
exaggerate if he said that all the marine at large lost one ship and ten lives per

day.

     Tlie number of lives saved either by the life-boats of the Eoyal National Life-
boat Institution of this country, or by special exertions, for which it has granted
rewards since its formation, is ;?9,050. In 1881 they saved 1,121 lives.

     It has been stated for a new charitable ' Society for the formation of Increased

Places of Safety on our coasts' that the primitive one, with an income of 40,000/.,
only saved 500 persons a-year. If those figures are correct, that means that the
saving of each life cost 80/.

     However, all English and foreign charitable associations are devoted to save
the lives of the wrecked, not to avoid or to diminish the collisions, the fires, and all
the causes of the wrecks.
654 EEPOET--1882.

The British Act of 1854, the Acts of Parliament relating to boats and buoys,

are now quite powerless, and of little use for saving life in wrecks. The number

and conditions of the boats, and the number and conditions of the buoys, can

only offer saving to one fraction of the human life shipped. What will be the sure

fate of the majority of the travellers in each one of two modern iron steamers,

with 400 or 500 lives, with boats only for 100 hands, coming in collision in the

ocean at the speed of 14 or more miles per hour ? Remember the recent collision

at full speed of the Douro and Yiu-ac Bat on a bright night. Neither the National

and Mercantile Marine nor the G overnment has done what is required to avoid those

Wesorrowful casualties.  must demand of science to fight against those enormous

losses of life and wealth by promoting a special International Congress to in-

vestigate the means to diminish the casualties at sea. This congress will ask for
the co-operation of meteorology, telegraphy, the building industry, and navi-
gation. Meteorology can improve, extend, and make more perfect the system of

storm-warning and meteorological reports. It is now an undoubted fact that the

warnings of storms from the Meteorological Othces in Europe and in America have

diminished the casualties at sea.

From the 1st of this month until August 31, next year, in pursuance of a

circular from the British Meteorological Office, the masters of ships crossing the
ocean will be taking daily observations, to be sent to the London Meteorological

Office, to know twice daily the state of the sea and of the atmosphere. These

observations will give important knowledge to establish more perfect warnings,

and in any case will deserve great interest to prepare more valuable inquiries.
    It is most important to improve oceanic telegraphy. At the present time the

ships alone keep the almost primitive system of flag and rocket signals и, and now it
is possible to introduce one of electrical, acoustical, and optical telegraphy to com-
municate between the ships themselves, and with the coasts. The efl'ect of this more
perfect maritime telegraph)' will be to avoid, or, at least, to diminish collisions ; and

the ships will have the knowledge of the state of the seas, and of the atmosphere

wherever they go or call b}' the telegrams sent to and from tlie coast, or from the

ships which proceed from those seas. The ships with that more perfect telegraphic
system wiU be able to demand more easily saving appliances from the coast or from

the other ships.

     In regard to the building industry it has been remarked that the modern iron

steamers offer smaller floating sections, and smaller floating bulk, than the old

wooden ships. The painful history of the last wreck gave an illustration of how

rapidly the iron steamers have been sunk. The ever-increasing speed of modern

navigation means certainly increased and more frequent danger and more tre-

mendous shocks, that is to say, increased loss of life and property. Therefore great

reform is needed in the building system, in order to diminish the number of
collisions and all casualties, and to supply at the same time more rapid and

powerful implements to save life and cargo.

Finally, as regai'ds navigation, the 'track' or road at sea must be fixed by police

rules, as on the railway it is neeessarj' to make a compiilsory difl'erent track for

each ditt'erent direction. This principle is observed for the translantic steamers of

the Cunard Line to avoid collisions, either with icebergs or with vessels from

an opposite direction. Specially, in the most frequented passages, as are for

instance the crossing points of the lines from England to Gibraltar, and from

Europe to America, must be established police rules of navigation bj- international

conventions.

In view of studying the practical means to diminish the maritime casualties,

an International Congress is intended to be held in Spain. The author desired that

the British Association should make some suggestions, so as to bring to a good

result the proposed Congress.

                     Section G.--MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

               --President of the Section John Fowler, C.E., F.G.S.

               THURSDAY, AUGUST 2i.

The President delivered the following Address :

Op all tlie important sections of the British Association the one over which I

have now the honour of presiding is, you will all, 1 think, admit, at once the

most practical and the most characteristic of the age. In future times the pre-

sent age will be remembered chiefly for the vast strides which have been made

in the advancement of Mechanical' Science. Other days have produced as great

mathematicians, chemists, physicists, warriors, and poets, but no other age has made

such demands upon the professors of mechanical science, or has given birth to so

many men of eminence in that department of knowledge. Though a member of

the profession myself, I may venture before my present audience to claim that the

civil engineer is essentially a product and a type of the latest development of the

present century. Telford has admirably deBned the profession of a civil engineer

as ' being the art of directing the great sources of power in nature for the use and

convenience of man, as the means of production and of traific in states both for

external and internal trade, as applied in the construction of roads, bridges, aque-

ducts, canals, river navigation and docks, for internal intercourse and exchange,

and in the construction of ports, liarbours. moles, breakwaters, and lighthouses,

and in the art of navigation by artificial power for the purposes of commerce, and in

the construction and adaptation of machinery, and in the drainage of cities and

towns.' This definition, written more than half a century ago, is wide enough to

include all branches of engineering of the present day, although amongst those

specifically mentioned the departments presided over by the railway engineer, tlie

locomotive superintendent, and the electrician will be looked for in vain. As

Telford was beyond all que.stionthe most widely experienced and far-seeing engineer

myof his time, this little omission well illustrates and justifies                                                                                                                                                                         statement that the

typical civil  engineer of the day is a late product of                                                                                                                                                                               the  present century                                                                          for even
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

Telford never foresaw the vast changes which railways, steam, and electricit}- would

evolve in the course of a few years.

    My predecessors in this chaii- have on several occasions stated their conviction

that it was better for the author of an address to confine his attention to the par-

ticular department of engineering in which he had special knowledge, than to wander

over the whole field of meclianical science. A. well-informed man has been defined
to be a man who knows a little about even/thiny and all about somethim/. If you
give me credit for being a well-informed engineer, I will endeavour to justify your

good opinion by showing, whilst presiding at these meetings, that I know a little

about steam-navigation, and maclunerj' generally                                                                                                                                                                                      a little about iron and steel, and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

other manufactures, and I trust a good deal about the construction of railways,

canals, docks, harbours, and other works of that class.

There have undoubtedly been published during the last fifty years manj' works

of mark and merit, but the work which above all others would, I think, have astonished

and perplexed our ancestors, is the little one known to all the civilised world as

' Bradshaw.' This indispensable handbook of the nineteenth centurv testifies that

the face of the country is dotted over literally with thousands of railway stations ; that

between many of these .stations trains run at two-minute intervals, whilst the dis-

tance between others is traversed at a mean speed of nearly 60 miles an hour.

The public are often justly indignant at the want of punctuality on some railways,

but they should blame the management and not the engineers, for the daily conduct

of the heavy traffic between England and Scotland shows, that notwithstanding
656 REPORT-- 1882.

the constantly varying condition of wind and weather in this climate, a run of

400 miles can, on a properly laid-out railway, and with suitably designed rolling-

stock, he accomplished with certainty to the minute, if the management is not at

fault. On the Great Northern Railway, for instance, of which I am consulting

engineer, the 400 miles between London and Edinburgh is traversed in nine hours,

or deducting the half-hour allowed at York for dining, at the mean rate of no less
Athan 47 miles per hour including stoppages.
                                                                      few months ago the Duke of

Edinburgh was taken on the same line of railway from Leeds to London, a

distance of 186f miles, in exactly three hours, or at a mean rate, including a stop
at Grantham, or over 62 miles an hour. I Iniow of no railway in the world where

this performance has been eclipsed, and it will be perhaps both instructive and

amusing to contrast with it tbe performance of the engines at the opening cere-

Amony of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, on September 15, 1830.

newspaper correspondent of the time, after describing many eventful incidents of
                                     :--
his  journey, proceeds  as  follows              '  The  twenty-four  vehicles  left  behind were now

formed into one  continuous  line, with the three        remaining engines            at their head
                                                                                                                                            ;

and at twenty minutes past five o'clock we set out on our return to Liverpool.

The engines not having the power, however, to drag along the double load that

had devolved upon them at a faster rate than from 5 to 10 miles an hour (once or

twice only, and that but for a few minutes, did it reach the rate of 12 miles an

hour), it was past eight o'clock before we reached Parkside. Proceeding

onwards, we were met on the Kenyon Embankment by two of the missing engines,

which were immediately attached to the three which had drawn us from Man-

Wechester.  went still slower than before, stopping continually to take in water

(query to take breath), and creeping along at a snail's pace till we reached Sutton

inclined plane, to pet up which the greater part of tbe company were under the

necessity of alighting and making use of their own legs. On reaching the top of

the plane we once more took our seats, and at ten o'clock we found ourselves again

at the company's station in Crown Street, having accomplished the distance of 33

miles in four hours and forty minutes.'

     The incident of the passengers descending from a train headed by five engines

to walk up an insignificant incline is, 1 thiuk, worthy of being recalled to the re-

membrance of the travelling public who are accustomed to see without astonish-

ment a single engine rushing along ^^ ith a train of a dozen heavy carriages at as
Wehigh a speed as if it were running alone.
                                                                      must do our immediate fore-

fathers, however, the justice to remember that even they effected some considerable

improvements in the speed of locomotion. For example, in 1763 the only public

conveyance for passengers between London and Edinburgh was a single coach,

which completed its journey in fourteen days, or at the average rate of 1^ mile per

hour. Strange as it may appear, there are at the present time many large fertile
districts in Hungary where, owing to the absence both of road and water commu-

nications, a higher rate of speed cannot be attained in a journey of several days'

duration.

    An essential condition of the attainment of high speed on the railway is that

the stopping places be few and far between. The Great Northern express previously
referred to makes its first halt at Grantham, a distance of 105 miles from London,
and consequently but little power and time are lost in accelerating and retarding
the speed of the train. In the instance of the Metropolitan Railway, nn the other
hand, the stations average but half a mile apart, and although the engines are as
powerful as those on the Great Northern Railway, whilst the trains are far lighter,

the average speed attainable is only some twelve miles an hour. No sooner has a

train acquired a reasonable speed than the brakes have to be sharply applied to pull

it up again. As a result of experiment and calculation, I have found that 60 per

cent, of the whole power exerted by the engine is absorbed by the brakes. Tn other
words, with a consumption of 30 lbs. of coal per train mile, no less than 18 lbs. are
expended in grinding away the brake-blocks, and only the remaining 12 lbs. in
doing the useful work of overcoming frictional and atmospheric resistance.

     Comparatively high speed and economy of working might be attained on a rail-

way with stations at half-mile intervals if it were possible to arrange the gradients
                                                       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.               657

SO that each station should he on the summit of a bill. An ideal railway would

have gradients of about 1 in 20 falling each way from the stations with a piece of

horizontal connecting them. With such gradients gravity alone would give an

accelerating velocity to the departing train at the rate of one mile per hour for every

second                             that is to say, in  half  a  minute  the  train would  have  acquired a velocity
                                ;

of thirty miles an hour, whilst the speed of the approaching train would he corre-

spondingly retarded without the grinding away of hrake-hlocks. t'ould such an

undulating railway be carried out, the consumption of fuel would probably not

exceed one-half of that on a dead level railway, whilst the mean speed would be

one-half greater. Although the required conditions are seldom attainable in prac-

tice, the broad principles should be kept in view by every engineer when laying out

a railway with numerous stopping-places.

Nearly thirty j-ears ago, when projecting the present system of underground

railways in the metropolis, I foresaw the inconveniences which would necessarily

result from the use of an ordinary locomotive, emitting gases in an imperfectly

ventilated tunnel, and proposed to guard against them by using a special form of

locomotive. When before the Parliamentary Committee in 1854, I stated that I

sliould dispense with firing altogether, and obtain the supply of steam necessarj- for

tlie performance of the single trip between Paddington and the City from a plain

cylindrical egg-ended boiler, which was to be charged at each end of the line witli

water and steam at a liigh pressuie. In an experimental boiler constructed for me,

the loss of pressure from radiation proved to be only .'jO lbs. per square inch in

five hours, so that practically all the power stored up would be available for use-

ful work. I also found by experiment that an ordinary locomotive with the fire

' dropped ' would run the whole length of my railway witli a train of the required

weiglit. Owing to a variety of circumstances, however, tliis hot-water locomotive

was not introduced on tlie Metropolitan Railway, though it has since been success-

fully used on tramways at New Orleans, Paris, and elsewhere. I am sorry to have

to admit that the progress of mechanical science, so far as it affects locomotives for

underground railways, has been absolutely nil during the past thirty years. The

locomotive at present employed is an ordinary locomotive, worked in the ordinary

way, except that in the tunnel the steam is condensed, and combustion is aided by

tlie natural draught of the chimney alone, instead of being urged by a forced blast,

as on open portions of the line. Whether a hot water, a compressed air, or a com-

pressed gas locomotive could be contrived to meet the exigencies of metropolitan

traffic is a question wdiich, I think, might be usefully discussed at the present or

some future meeting of the Association.

   A reference to the underground railway naturally suggests the wider question

of tunnels in general. The construction of tunnels was not one of the novelties

presenting itself to railway engineers, for many miles of tunnel had been driven by

canal engineers before a single mile of passenger railway had been built in this

or any other country. To foreign engineers belongs the honour of liaving boldly

conceived and ably accomplished tunnel works of a magnitude which would have

appalled a canal engineer. I need only refer to the Mont Cenis Tunnel, over

7^ miles in length, commenced in 1857 and finished in 1870; the St. Gothard

Tunnel, 9| miles in length, commenced in 1872 and finished in 1882; and the

Hoosac Tunnel, 4J miles in length, commenced in 1854 and finished in 1875. In
all cases rock of the hardest character had to be pierced, and it is needless to

remark that without the aid of the machinist in devising and manufacturing

compressed air machinery and rock-boring plant the railway engineer could not

have accomplished his task. Intermediate shafts are not attainable in tunnels

driven through great mountnin ranges, so all the work has to he done at two faces.

In the case of the Mont Cenis Tunnel the mean rate of progress was 257 feet and
the maximum 400 feet per month. In the St. Gothard Tunnel the mean rate was
429 feet and the maximum 810 feet. In the Hoosac Tunnel the average rate was

150 feet per month.

Tunnels under broad navigable rivers and estuaries have been a subject of

discussion by engineers for at least a century, but the only one at present com-

pleted is the unfortunate and costly Thames Tunnel. Two important works of the

1882.                                                           uu

class are, however, no-w well in hand, namely the Severn Tunnel at Portskewet,

and the Mersey Tunnel at Liverpool. Having reference to this fact, it will be

interesting to quote the following passage from a letter addressed to the press by a

--Mr. Thoroas Deakin on March 6, 1835, that is to say more than forty-seven years

a!?o. Mr. Deakin writes: 'The Great Western railroad from London to Bristol

wiU be accomplished no doubt, and why not continue it under the Severn mouth,

near Chepstow, Monmouthshire, through Glamorganshire, and to Milford Haven

--in Pembrokesbire ? It would then traverse the coal-field of South Wales through-

out its whole extent a tract of country possessing also inexhaustible stores of

Aironstone.  tunnel was once proposed to be formed under the Mersey at Liver-

pool, and had it not been for the failure of the Thames Timnel would most

prob.iblr have been carried into effect.' It is not a little singular that the two

tunnels 'thus foreshadowed by Mr. Deakin should both be in hand at the present

moment.
     Undoubtedly the numerous accidents which occurred during the construction of

the Thames Tunnel, together with its enormous cost of about 1,500/. per lineal

yard, and the eighteen years occupied in its construction, destroyed the chance of

any other projected subaqueous timnel for many subsequent years. One lesson

enforced bv the Thame.sTunnel was the necessity of lea vine: a reasonable thickness of
o-round between the water and the tunnel. In the Severn Tunnel the minimum

thiclmess is 40 feet, and in the Mersey Tunnel 22 feet. The width of the river at
the point of crossing of the former tunnel is 2^^ miles, and the maximum depth of

the rails below high water 163 feet. In the case of the Mersej^ Tunnel the width is
nearlv of a mile and the depth 144 feet. The Thames Tunnel, as almost everyone

                          if

knows, was carried on by means of a special contrivance termed by Brunei a 'shield.'

No special appliances have been adopted in the case either of the Severn or the

Mersev tunnel. Both are di-iven in the ordinary way, but of course enormous

pumping power is required and has been provided.

     Where no special appliances are used in the construction of a subaqueous tunnel,
it will be clear to all that an unknown risk is eneoimtered. All may go well, and

the encrineer will then justly receive congratulations from everyone for his boldness

and success. But, on the other hand, something may go wrong, even at the last

moment, and I fear the engineer then would be abused no less roundly by the
unthinkinsr public ibr his temerity and consequent failure. It would be a ' Majuba
Hill ' incident over again, and if the accident caused much loss of life the engineer

probably would envy the fate of the brave but ill-starred General Colley, who at

least fell with the victims of his rashness.

In manv cases of tunnels under estuaries, special appliances could be used which

would obviate all risk and make the successful completion of the work a mathe-
Amatical certainty.
                     tunnel under the Ilumber, about li mile in length, projected

by mvself in 1873, the Bill for which was subsequently passed by the Commons
and thrown out by the Lords, was a case in point. The bed of the Humber is of

verv fine silt, and I proposed to build the tunnel in lengths of 160 feet, under the

protection of rectangular iron caissons 160 feet long, by 42 feet wide, sunk by the

pneumatic process. As the pressure of the air in the caissons would alwavs be

slio-htlv in excess of that due to the head of water in the river, no interruption

from influx of water could ever occur, and the operation of building the tunnel in

leno'ths inside this huge diving-bell would be as certain and free from risk as the

every-day work of sinking a bridge pier by the pneumatic process.

   A tunnel over a mile in length now in progress under the Hudson River at

New York is being driven through a silty stratum by the aid of compressed air,

and with a certain amount of success, as only some twenty men have been drowned

up to the present time. The principle upon which the compressed air is used is,

however, a false one, since it is merely forced into the tunnel with a view to uphold

the o-rouud by its pressure, like so much timbering, and not to keep out the water on

the principle of a diving-bell. It is clear, therefore, that the completion of the

Hudson River Tunnel, if the present system be persevered in, is purely a matter of

conjecture, and all we can do is to hope for the best. The same remark applies,

of coui-se, to the Severn Tunnel and the Mersey Tunnel, although in those cases the
         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                             659

cliaracter of the ground is such that the contingencies are small in comparison with

those encoimtered in the construction of the Thames Tunnel and the Hudson Eiver

Tunnel. Nevertheless, as I have already observed, unless special appliances of the

nature of the pneumatic process he used, a subaqueous tunnel, whether it be the

Channel Tunnel itself or one but a few yards in length, must necessarily present an

unknown* risk. The prototype of all these tunnels is the one commenced at

Rotherhithe in 1809, which was successfully driven a distance of 900 feet under
the Thames and failed when within little more than 100 feet of the opposite shore.

A tunnel about li mile in length was commenced about ten years ago under the

Detroit Eiver in America, but was abandoned in a similar manner. So far good

fortune has attended both the Severn and the Mersey tunnels, and there is, 1 am

glad to say, every chance of its continuing.

That the series of mishaps with the Thames Tunnel, and the consequent post-

ponement of all other projects for subaqueous tunnels, were due to errors in design and

want of foresight on the part of the engineer is patent to everyone now, and was

foreseen by at least one acute contemporary of Brunei himself. Only a few months

ago, when turning over the leaves of an old periodical, I became aware of the fact

that a scheme, identical in all its main features with my Humber Tunnel project,

had been suggested for adoption in the case of the Thames Tunnel, in lieu of the

plan proposed by Brunei. Writing in December 182-3, or fifty-nine years ago, the

author of the project, a working smith of the name of Johnson, says : ' I propose to

construct the Thames Tunnel without cofferdams by making it in parts, 28 feet

in length, each part having the ends temporarily stopped up and beinp: coustrticted

on the same jn-inciple as the diving-bell. The men dig from the inside round the

edge as if sinking a well, and throw the earth towards a dredger, the buckets of

which work some feet below the bottom of the excavation. Each length will be

suspended between two vessels and be conveyed to the place where it is to be let
Adown.'
         description of the mode of connecting the several lengths is given, and I

may add that the tunnel blocks had a sloping face to tend to bring the "faces of the

joints together, a plan smce adopted with the huge concrete blocks at Kurrachee

and other harbours. There is not a flaw in the design from beginning to end, as

modern experience in the sinking of numerous bridge-piers on precisely the same

plan has amply demonstrated. It is be)'ond all doubt that if the design of this

working smith had been adopted in lieu of that tendered by Brunei the Thames

Tunnel woidd have been completed in a couple of years, instead of eighteen years,

and at a cost of about 300/. per yard instead of 1 ,500/.

If another tunnel be constructed under the Thames, which is far from improb-

able, as the requirements of below-bridge trafEc necessitate some such means of

communication, I venture to predict it will be built in accordance with the plan

suggested iifty-nine years ago by the working smith, and not on that of Brunei's

Thames Tunnel, or of any other tunnel yet carried out.

At the beginning of the present century a committee was appointed to consider

the ' practicability of making a land communication by a tunnel under the river

Forth, at or near Queensferry.' In a report dated November 14, 1805, it was

recommended that a double tunnel should be constructed, at an estimated cost of

164,000/., or at the rate of .30/. per yard, exclusive of shafts and pumping. The

surveyors reporting, grounded their belief in its practicability upon the fact that at

Borrowstowness coal-workin╗s had been carried under the same firth for a mile,
and that at Whitehaven coal was worked for the same distance under the Irish Sea,

in both places less watei- being met with under the sea than under the laud. The

report concludes in the following words : 'That a more easy and uninterrupted

communication betwixt every part of a country increases the intercourse of com-

merce, arts, and agriculture, all must know. Ferries are still and often a formid-

able bar in the road. Of these in this country, the one under review at Queens-

ferry is perhaps the most conspicuous. It is in ftrct tlie connecting point betwixt

the north and south of Scotland, and indeed of the realm, and in this point of view

the improvement of it must be considered a national object.' These words are as

Atrue and applicable to the case in 1882 as they were in 1805.  ferry still is the

only means of communication across the Forth at Queensferry, though the traffic

has increased a hundredfold. Parliament, hj the passing of the Forth Bridge Act

durino- the present session, has given a practical recognition ot the truth ot the

oceaii-"-oinc' steamers. The practical result of the existence of this splendid line of
naturalf communication is that iron girders and rails can be conveyed from the heart
of Belgium to the metropolis at a far lower price per ton than from any ironworks
in this country. Unfortunately, the southern coast of England and the opposite
coast of France are indented by no such rivers as the Thames and the Scheldt, or

Canada for instance, we have the great inland port of Montreal, where trans-
atlantic steamers anchor some 500 miles from the coast. The yery term ' stream of
                                           Lawrence well illustrates it. Into some small

country through which it flows, but it was,
since without Nile water there would not be          a green spot in the whole of that now

fertile land. Haying filled the office of consulting engineer to the Egyptian
Government for seyen years, I have had occasion to give particular attention to
the Nile, and I may state that in an average year that river conveys no less than
100 000 million tons of water, and 65 million tons of silica, alumina, lime, and
other fertilising solids down to the Mediterranean. The Nile begins to rise about
the middle of June, at which time the discharge averages about 3-50 tons of water
per second, and attains in September a height of from 19 feet to 28 feet, and a dis-

charge of from 7,000 to 10,000 tons per second.
            TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                                               661

     Napoleon the Great said that every drop of Nile water should be thrown on the

land, and he was right so far as Low Nile discharge is concerned. The cultivated

lands in the provinces of Lower Egypt have an area of 3 million acres, and to

irrigate this eHectually at least 30 millions of tons of water per day would be

required, an amount somewhat exceeding the whole of the Low Nile discharge.
At present the irrigation canals are totally inadequate to convey this quantity, and

imperfect irrigation and consequent loss of crops is the result. In many instances
a couple of men labour for a hundred days in watering by shadoof a single acre of
ground, all which amount of labour might be dispensed with if the barrage of the

Nile were completed, and a few other works carried out, the whole of which would

be paid for handsomely by a water rate of two shilhngs an acre. You will gather,

therefore, that I do not think the resources of Egypt have yet been fully developed,

niagniticent as they even now are, having reference to the size of the country.

     It is hardly necessary to say that a network of canals laid out with a view to
irrigating the lands of Lower Egypt can also be used at any time in the event of
war for the oH'ensive or defensive flooding of the whole or any part of the said

lands. Except for the work of man, Lower Egypt for four mouths in the year

would be simply the bed of a river, and for the remaining months a mud bank.
Long before the historic period, however, the Nile had been embanked and canals,

such as the Bahr-Jusef, had  been formed                                                             the first, to keep the Hoods off the land,
                                                                                                  ;

except in desired quantities ; and the second, to run off' the inundation waters as

soon as the fertilising matters in suspension had been deposited on the lauds.

Should the inhabitants of Egypt neglect at any time to maintain the works of their

ancestors, successive floods would quickly destroy the embankments and wash the

light material into the canals. Thus the whole surface of the country would again

be levelled, and the land of Egypt would revert to its primitive condition of being

a river's bed for one-third of the year, and probably a malarious swamp for the

remainder.

It is hardly possible to I'efer to Egypt without saying a few words about the

Suez Canal. Far-seeing people, including the late Khedive, have long been of the

opinion that another ship canal will be required in Egypt. In 1876 I submitted to

His Highness, in accordance with my instructions, detailed plans and estimates for

such a canal from Alexandria through Cairo to Suez. The total length of the
canal was 240 miles, and with the same width as the existing Suez Canal the

estimated quantity of excavation Was 160 million cube yards.

    An interesting and signiticant incident in the history of the Suez Canal occurred
in May 1878, when a fleet consisting of ten steamers and sixteen sailing vessels

passed through with 8,412 native troops bound from India to Cyprus. During the

same year no less than 58,274 soldiers traversed the Canal. Since 1878 events have

marched rapidly, forno one then foresaw that the next important movement of British

troops canal-ways would be of a nature hostile in appearance, if not in fact, to the

inhabitants of Egj^pt. The announcement that French and not British troops

were to hold the canal was received by the public with an expression of surprise

and perhaps of slight resentment, because no one can dispute the vital importance
of the work to this country. Periodically the question of the Euphrates Valley

Railway is revived, and indeed quite recently I have had to reconsider the question

professionally, but this route can never rival the existing one by the Isthmus of

Suez.

The inauguration of steam navigation to India wasmuch delayed bythe vacillation

of the authorities respecting the Suez and the Euphrates Valley routes. Happily,

however, the Arabs stole the first bag of mails that went by the Euphrates, and so
in 1834 a Committee of the House of Commons finally resolved that 'steam naviga-

tion between Bombay and Suez having in five successive seasons been brought to

the test of experiment, and the practicability of that line being established, it be
recommended to His iVIajesty's Government to extend the line of Malta packets to

Egypt, to complete the commimication between England and India.' Nothing

appears to have been done during the next two years, but in 1837 a new paddle-

wheel steamer, the Atlanta, of 650 tons, steamed out to Calcutta round the (Jape in

ninety-one days and was put on the Red Sea station. She left Bombay with the

mails on October 2nd, 1837, and arrived at Suez on October IGtli. The mails were
carried across tlie desert bj^ camels, and down the Nile to Alexandria in four days,
wliere tliey remained until II. M.S. Volcano took them on board on November 7th.

At Malta on November 16th they were transferred to H.M.S. Fire/It/, and tiually

were landed in this country on December 4th, having been in all sixty-three days in

coming from Bombay to England. At the present time about eighteen days are

occupied in carrying the mails from Bombay via Brindisi to London.
    The town of Southampton, where we are now assembled, has always held a

distinguished position in connection with the development of improved communi-

cation with our Eastern empire. The opening of the first section of the railway

from London to Southampton was coincident with the establishment of steam

navigation via Egypt to India, and in the same year the French engineers at Cairo

completed their .studies for the proposed railway across the desert to Suez.

   A few months later the London public were startled by an advertisement

headed ' Steam to New York,' and 94 passengers were plucky enough to embark at

London, on April 4tli, 1838, in the Sinus, of 700 tons and 320 horse-power, for New

York, where they arrived on the 23rd, having performed tlie voj'age in seventeen

davs from London, and fifteen days from Queeustown. The Great Western sailed

from Bristol on April 7th, and arri^'ed at New York a few hours after the Sirius, and

thus was the great problem of steam navigation to America successfully solved, by

vessels of small size, and capable of maintaining a speed of but 8 to miles an

hour. I need hardly remind you that since the year 1838 the ships conducting

the enormous traffic between Europe and America have been of ever-increasing

size and speed. Thus the Britannic, built in 1874, has an extreme length of 468

feet, a beam of 45 feet 3 inches, a displacement of 8,500 tons, and a speed of 16

knots per hour; whilst the Servia, built in 1881, has an extreme length of 530 feet,

a beam of 52 feet, a displacement of 13,000 tons, and a .speed of 18 knots, and the

City of Rome, built in the same year, has a length of 600 feet, a beam of 52 feet

3 inches, and a displacement of 13,500 tons. Another Atlantic liner, the Alaska.

having a length of 500 feet, a beam of 50 feet, and a disjilacemeut of 12,000 tons,

attained a speed of 18i knot.s on the measured mile, and has done the distance

between Queenstown and New York in seven days four hours and thirty-two

minutes, and the return voyage in six days and twenty-two hours, a mean ocean

speed of, say, 17 knots per hour, or oore than double that of the first steam-vessels

trading to America.

The present generation has grown so accustomed to the embodied restdts of the

progress of mechanical science, that it has long ceased to wonder at big ships, or at

any other novelty. To reali-se what has been attained it is necessary to place our-

selves as far as pos.sible in the position of our immediate ancestors, and to look at

things through their spectacles. "With this view, and to give you some scale of

comparison to measure the size of the present Atlantic liners by, I will quote a

short passage from a newspaper of September 19, 1829, where reference is made to

a vessel then imder construction, of about the size of one of the much-abused

' cockleshells ' performing the Channel service between Dover and Calais. ' The Dutch

have been engaged for the last five years in constructing and equipping a steam-

boat of extraordinary magnitude, in order to facilitate the communication between

Holland and Batavia. It has four masts ; is about 250 feet long ; and has been

ajipropriately christened the Monster. In consequence of her great length, she

hung when going oft" the slips, and it was some da3's before she was fairly launched

a circumstance which gave the wits of Paris occasion to remark that their Dutch

neighbours were so determined to excel all other nations in the magnitude of their

steamboats, that they had built one so long that it was several days running oft"

the stocks. One of the most remarkable features of this enormous vessel is her ex-

treme narrowness as compared with her length her gi'eatest breadth of beam being
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

only about 32 feet. The great size of this vessel will bring to the recollection of

our readers the Columbus, which was built in the river St. Lawrence in 1824, and

made the passage to England in safety, but was afterwards broken up on account

Weof her unmanageable bulk.  shall not be surprised to find that a similar fate

awaits the Monster, and for a similar reason.'
TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                         663

    The Channel boat Albert Victor, now on the Folkestone station, is of the same
length as the Monster, namely 250 feet, %yhilst the beam of the former is but 29
feet, instead of what the critic of 1829 termed the ' extreme narrowness ' of 32

feet.

     The successive attempts at mitigating the discomforts of the Channel passage
by the swinging saloon and twin-steamers of Sir Henry Bessemer and Captain Dicey
have gradually prepared the way for what I believe will be the next and important
step of establishing C'hannel communication bj^ means of large floating stations,
or ferry-steamers, capable of traversing the narrow sea between England and
France in little more than an hour. Ten years ago I applied to Parliament for
powers to carry out this project, and obtained the unanimous sanction of a Committee
of the House of Commons. The Bill was, however, thrown out in the House of

Lords by the casting vote of the chairman.

    What was practicable at that time has now become comparatively easy, owing

to tlie introduction of steel into shipbuilding, and the improvements which have

been eilected in marine engines and mechanical appliances generally.

  --Whether the over-sea or under-sea mode of crossing the Channel the ferry or
--the tunnel is to be the adopted scheme, will soon be determined. It may be that

both will be carried out, and then at least all tastes will be met, and all anticipa-

tions respecting the resulting increase in traffic, both in goods and passengers,

between the two countries will be brought to the test of experience. However this

may be, I am very pleased to be able to announce that my friends Mr. Aber-

netby and Mr. Clarke Hawkshaw will read papers on the subject, the former on

the over-sea, and the latter on the under-sea plan, and I shall be disappointed if

the papers do not lead to an interesting and valuable discussion.

In few departments of the engineer's work has .such progress been made as in

that of steam navigation. A\Tien in 1820 steamships were tirst used for conveying

merchandise as well as passengers, the tonnage of the whole of the steam traders

of this country, it is stated, amounted to but 505 tons. At the present time the

corresponding figure is 2^ million tons. Did time permit I woidd say more on the

subject, but I fear that in speaking at all upon steamships I have departed some-

what fi-om my avowed intention of keeping within the sphere of engineering, in

Mywhich I have chiefly worked.        apology must be that a discussion of railways

led me to a consideration of tunnels and bridges, and this naturally suggested a

reference to the rivers necessitating the construction of the said tunnels and

bridges. From river traffic to ocean traffic is but a step, and so I have been in-

sensibly led to touch upon the wonderful results achieved in recent times by naval

architects and mechanical engineers.

I will not similarly err in troubling you with any remarks of mine npon the
Ano less wonderful results achieved by electricians.
                                                      description of the work done

by my friend Dr. Siemens during the past quarter of a century would in itself

constitute a concise history of electrical science. Remembering, however, the

warning of King Solomon, that ' He who praiseth his friend with a loud voice, it

shall be counted a curse to him,' I will refrain fi-om referring to Dr. Siemens, or to

my immediate predecessor in this chair, Sir W. G. Armstrongr, and conclude my

address at once with a sincere wish that the present session of the British

Association may prove not less interesting and productive of benefit to science than

have any of those which have preceded it.

   3. On the increased Tenacity in perforated Test Bars of Steel and Iron.
                               By T. SVkightson, M.I.G.E.

     The author quotes the experiments of Professor Keuneilv,^ and of Mr. Edw.ard

Richards,^ as to the curious fact, that a drilled test har has a greater tenacity per
square inch than a plain bar, and proceeds to propound a theory as to the cause for
this apparent anomaly.

      If a plate or bar under tensile test be supposed to consist of a series of molecular
chains or filaments parallel one to another, but disconnected laterally except at the
ends, then, as the test proceeds, each filament being equally loaded would extend
without afiecting its neighbour. Again, if horizontal filaments be supposed to con-
nect the longitudinal filameut.s, these will descend as stretching takes place, but will
not affect the relative position of the longitudiual filaments.

     If, however, we suppose diagonal connections to exist between the upper end of

the extreme and the centres of the opposite filaments, it is evident that when, through
stretching, the centres of the longitudinal filaments descend, either an elongation of
the oblique filaments or a drawing in of the longitudinal filaments must occur. The
resistance of tbe latter in this direction being small, a lateral movement takes place.
The author contends that the well-kuowu ])henomenon of contraction in a test bar
arises from this cause, and is due to the oblique connection of the longitudinal

filaments.

     Assuming this view of the phenomenon of contraction to be correct, the author
supposes a hole drilled in the centre of a test bar, and shows that the two sections
left should be capable of resisting more than the same section in a single bar because
the contraction of area in the former case is resisted by the material immediately
above and below the hole, which must be stretched horizontally before the adjacent
iron can contract to its full extent. Hence the area being partially maintained by
the action of these cross strains the bar should be stronger. That this is so has
been abundantly proved, but the author goes further in describing an experiment
showing that in drilling several holes in a line across the bar, the tenacity increases
with an increased number of holes. Thus an iron bar two inches wide by half inch

thick broke at 22'68 tons per square inch of original area. When an inch hole was

drilled in the centre of a test piece cut from the same bar the tenacity increased to

22'93 tons. Two holes half an inch in diameter increased the tenacity to 2482

tons. Three holes one-third inch diameter increased the tenacity to 24-99 tons, or
about 1 per cent, total increase, comparing the plain bar with that perforated with
three holes cutting away half the section.

     These facts show that the form of a test bar may be such as to bring into action
the cross fibres of the material in such a way as considerably to afi'ect the results

obtained.

indicated horse-power; the draft loaded to 12 feet; estimated speed, 23 miles. It
is thought that vessels of this size would not feel any movement iu the Cliannel.
The cost for three steam-vessels, and the necessary works at Dover and Calais, was

estimated at a million and a half.

                         By Major Allan Cunningham, B.E.

     The motion of water in open channels is essentially an unsteady motion tvith
interlacing stream-lines ; the hypothesis of steady parallel motion is at variance with

nature.

     Single velocity measurements are of little practical use, being only accidental
values; the average of a large number is pretty constant, so that the average
velocities should always be sought. The time needed to obtain these involves a
chance of change of the external conditions.

      In practical hydraulics the forward velocity is the only velocity considered or
required. Floats measure this directly ; no other instruments yield this quantity

readily iu large streams.

     These principles are of great importance, and sliow that hydraulic experiments
must always be tedious and expensive.

 6. Convexity of Surface of Streams.^ By Major Allan Cdnningham, B.E.

     The figure of the transverse section of the free surface of a stream, usually
supposed to be convex, is here considered. The evidence is shown to be very
small. Some new special experiments are cited. The conclusion is that the surface

is probably level across.

7. Depression of Maximum Velocity} By Major Allan Cunningham, B.E.

     The line of maximum velocity in an open channel is usually below the surface.
The cause of the depression is obscure. The wind and disturbances from the
banks and bed are usually supposed to be the causes. The wind is probably too

inconstant. The disturbances from the banks and bed seem an inadequate ex-

planation. The general depression of the maximum %elocity on all verticals at all

parts of a channel indicates some resistance from above. The motion in open
channels and in pipes flowing full shows some similarity, with differences in detail
fairly accounted for by supposing the air to be an ever-present drag or source of
resistance to forward surface-flow less efficient than the banks or bed. If this be
admitted, the hydraulic term, ' wet border/ must be modified so as to include all
jyarts of the wet border, eacli with its own specific resistance.

                                         1. On Compressed Air as applied to Locomotion.
                                                By Sir Frederick Bramwell, F.B.S.

This paper consisted of a description of a tram-car on the Mekarski system now
Aemployed at Nantes in France.
                                                                    car on a similar system is bein╗' constructed for

trial on the tramway running from Kings Cross to Ilolloway. The gauge of the

French line is 4 feet 8-h inches, the wheel base of the car being 5 feet 9 inches. The

principal features of the engine consist in the use of what is termed a ' hot pot,'

and in an automatic regulating valve. The hot pot is a receptacle containing hot

water and steam under pressure, and through tliis the compressed air is allowed to

bubble on its way from the receivers to the cylinders, so that it may be expanded

in the cylinders without risli of the formation of snow. The automatic regulating-

Avalve is set on the top of the hot-water vessel.                              hand-wheel lowers or raises a

plunger                                  this acts upon the liquid  contained  between  an  elastic india-rubber dia-
                                      ;

phragm placed a little below the plunger and the upper part of the vessel. Just

around the plunger there is an annular air-space acting as an air-vessel. When

the plunger Ls depressed into the liquid, the result is to compress the air in the air-

vessel to any desired extent. Then, as the hot pot is always in connection with the

reservoirs in wliicli the compressed air is contained, when the outlet air cock on

the regulating valve is opened, air bubbles through the hot water and rises past

the cone valve which is attached to the diaphragm, and presses on the under side

of the diaphragm, tending to raise it ; but it cannot succeed in doing so until the

pressure of the air below the diaphragm equals that in the annular air-vessel

above, and thus tlie pressure in the annular air-vessel is automatically the measure

of the pressure that will prevail in the engines. So soon as this is exceeded the

diaphragm rises and closes the \iilve ; and so soon as it falls the air in the annular

air-vessel re-expands, presses down the diaphragm, opens the conical valve, and

lets in more compressed air. The dri^ er is thus enabled to vary the pressure, while

the pressure, whatever it may be, is maintained steady, whether the engines are

running fast or slow.

The working of the engines was very satisfactory. There was no smoke, no

escape of the steam, no noise. The exhaust air is let into a box, from whence it

escapes quietly just above the level of the road. So far as can be judged from

outside appearance there is scarcely anything to distinguish one of these cars from

an ordinary horse tram-car. The compressed air reservoirs are charged at one end

of the journey. For this purpose four horizontal condensing steam-engines are

used, each of about 20 nominal horse-power. Each engine works two single-

acting air-pumps. The first air-pump compresses to six atmospheres, the second

draws from the first and compresses to thirty. While the compressed air is being

charged into the receivers, steam is turned into the hot pOt, so as to heat the water,

a certain quantity of the \\-ater being, wlien necessary, allowed to run out. Ac-

cording to information given to the autlior, it appeared tliat the cost of working

the line on this system was less than the cost of horse-power, and the system had

besides several other advantages.

        2. Recent Progress in Telepliony. By W. H. Preece, F.B.S.

     This paper gave an account of the progress made in the construction of tele-
phonic apparatus since the telephone was introduced to the British Association in
1877. The author described the principal forms of telephone receivers and trans-

mitters, including those of Ader, Gower, Dolbear, Edison, Blake, and others. He

also described the arrangements which have been made to diminish induction on
busy lines, and thereby to get rid of tlie noise which is the chief difficulty in trans-
mitting articulate speech. The only really successful plan was that of employing
a complete metallic circuit instead of using the earth for the return circuit, and
twisting together the two wires composing this circuit. In concluding, the author
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  667

gave an account of an experiment lately tried, by wliicli communication had been
effected between Southampton and the Isle of Wight across the Soleiit, the object
being to trv the possibility of establishing communication across seas and channels
by telephone without the aid of wires. Large metal plates were innnersed in the
sea at opposite ends of the Solent-- namely, at Portsmouth and liyde, six miles
apart, and at Hurst Castle and Sconce Point, one mile apart. The Portsmouth and
Hurst Castle plates were connected by a wire passing tlirough Southampton, and
the Rydc and Sconce Point plates by a wire passiug through Newport ; tlie circuit
was completed liy the sea, and signals were passed which could be read liy the

Morse system, but speech was not possible.

            3. Oa a new Arc Lawi). By W. H. Preece, F.R.S.

    This is the invention of M. Abdank, a Polish professor residing in Paris. He

separates the regulator of the current from the lamp itself, and hxes it anywhere
within easy inspection and manipulation. The regulator is a differential balance,
and it acts like the key of a jNIorse apparatus, which sends automatically short,
rapid, successive currents through a local break, so as to allow the top carbon to
fall by very minute movements as it ia consumed. The carbon is continually
falling by a motion invisible to the eye, but sufficient to provide for the consumption
of the carbons. It is a remarkably constant and steady arc lamp. Regulation by
small and successive steps automatically controlled is believed to be a new prhiciple.

          4. Recent Progress in Electric Railways. By Dr. Fleming.

     This paper described Edison's railway at Menlo Park, which the author said
saved about 1 lb. of coal per hour per horse-power as compared with the ordinary

locomotive.

              5. On Electric Light Engineering. By Dr. Fleming.

   6. On the Efficiency of the Edison Steam Dynamo. By Dr. Fleming.

        7. On some Ajiparatus for use in connection with Electric Light
                          Measurement, By Robert Sabine.

     The writer gives an account of four pieces of apparatus devised for the purpose,

^иiz :

   A1. photometer.
   A2. current dynamometer.
   A3. potential dynamometer and resistance measurer combined.
   A4. mean-pressure indicator.

     The principle employed in the photometer is tliat such a thickness of some
absorbing material is placed in the path of the rays of each of the two lights imder
comparison as will partly equalise the two lights, the final adjustment being made by
the alteration of the relative distances of the lights from the photometer. The current
dynamometer is formed of two flat coils, one of which is suspended, and the other
arranged to slide along a scale. Suitable arrangements are made for allowmg
the current to pass through the whole sj'stem. The repulsion between the coils
results in the deflection of the suspended coil. The sliding coil is then shifted
until the two coils are parallel. Tlie paper describes the way in which the scale is
graduated, and the arrangements for observing the deflection of the suspended coil.

     The potential dj'namometer and resistance measurer consists of two circular coils
of moderately fiiie copper wire, one of which is held by a bifilar wii"e suspension
inside the other, as in Weber's well-known dynamometer, an adjustable resistance

being inserted to reduce the deflections to a constant value. When required, how-

ever, to be used as a galvanometer the suspended coil can be readily removed and
replaced by a magnet needle. The object of the mean-pressure indicator is to

allow the mean pressure at either end of the cylinder to be read off' by the use of a

ABourdon pressiu'e-gaucre.  pressure-gauge is mounted at each end of the cylinder,

the pipe leading to the gauge being throttled so as to allow a small entry and

exit of steam at each stroke. This throttling causes the pointer of the gauge to

rise gradually to the mean pressure, above or below which it makes small oscilla-

tions. To prevent condensation in the throttle or tube, these are kept hot by the

flame of a lamp placed below. ^

                             8. On a new form of Arc Laviv.
                     By Professor G. Foebes, M.A., F.E.S.E.

     This is a focussing arc lamp. Tlie carriers of the two carbons are supported by
vertical racks which are worked by pinions, one of which is twice the diameter of

the other. These pinions are on the same axis as the ring of a small Gramme

motor ; a current is supplied to this ring by a shunt from one on the main wires.

One field magnet of the motor is wound with thick wire and is in the main circuit
the other is wound with fine wire. It is connected as a shunt on the arc.

9. On the Laws defining the Strength of Current ivhich can he sent through

      Wires of different diameters luiihout raising the external tem]ieratureahove

    a certain limit. By Professor G. Forbes, M.A., F.E.S.E.

  --Law I. When the wire is bare and exposed to the air, the strength of current

is more nearly proportional to the diameter of the wire than to the theoretical

--value of the diameter raised to the power |.
    Laiv II. When the wire is wound in coils of the same size and weight, the

strength of current is proportional to the square of the diameter of the wire.

    To find out the first law, a trace of wax was put upon the wires, and the
current necessary to melt it was measured.

     To find out the second law, thermometers were inserted in coils of equal size
and weight, and the currents required to raise each to the same temperature were
compared.

    The following Report and Papers were read :

  --1. Report of the Committee on Wind Pressure. See Reports, p. 315.

                  2. On the Mechanical Properties of Aluminium.

                             By W. H. Barlow, F.Ii.S.

   A bar of aluminium, three feet long and a quarter of an inch square, was

obtained, and diflerent parts of this bar were subjected to test for tension, com-
pression, and transverse strain ; and also to ascertain the modulus of elasticity, the
elastic range, and ductility.

     It wiU be seen on reference to the results obtained, that the weight of a cubic
inch is '0275 lbs., showing a specific gravity of 2688, and that its ultimate tensile
strength is about 12 tons per square inch. The range of elasticity is large, the
extension at the yielding point being ---^ part of its length. The modulus of elas-
ticity is 10,000. The ductility in samples 2 inches long was 2'5 per cent.

     Taking the tensile strength of this metal in relation to its weight, it shows a
high mechanical value. Its characteristics in this respect, as compared with those

--of other well-known metals, are shown in the following summary :

better effect could be obtained by the use of Argand burners with chimneys, than
from any burner of the ordinary flat flame type. The paper concluded with some
remarks on ventilation, and on the way in which heat generated by the combustion

of gas coidd be utilised for ventilating purposes.

                6. On Sound Signals. By E. Price Edwakds.

The purposes for which such signals are employed are chiefly in connection with

railway and sea travelling. No recent improvement as regards railway sound

signals can be recorded, but there has been a great development of late years with

marine sound signals. Railway whistles are very distressing to the public ; not so

to the callous engine-drivers who use them without any regard to the public com-

fort. This is a matter which might be ventilated by the press, for there is a great

deal of unnecessary whistling, and there is no necessitj^ for the use of the piercingly

shrill sounds which are commonly employed in this country. The explosive signals

used in foggy weather are admittedly inefficient and costly, besides Ijeing annoying

to railway travellers. For signals between ships at sea, the recent alteration of the

regulations for preventing collisions has necessitated the use of sound signals to a con-

siderable extent, and various instruments operated by manual labour have been devised

to meet the requirements as regards sailing vessels ; steamers of course use the steam

whistle. For coast fog-signals there has been a great progress made of late years

whistles are not used for this purpose, reed horns have been discarded, and now
Asirens and explosives only are used.
                                       novel feature of late with the siren is the

introduction of two notes as a means of distinction. Each signal is to have a com-

bination of high and low notes so that it may proclaim its own individuality and

be readily recognised. It is also proposed to make double explosive signal rockets,
by means of which a further distinction may be made for this class of sound

siprnals.

7. Some of the Causes of Collision at Sea. By Captain Colojib, B.N.

    The causes assigned in the Annual Wreck Register, according to the official

--statement for the year 1879-80, were divided into two classes : (1) conditions
                              and  inevitable                                         and (2) the  moral obliquities of seamen.
which      are  irremediable                                                       ;

The former comprise 40 per cent., and the latter tlie remaining 60 per cent.

The classification is unsatisfactory because collisions can rarely be set down to a

single cause ; and because, though inevitable conditions are always present, they do

not necessarily produce ine-\-itable accidents.
     There has never yet been any public enquiry into the causes of collision, nor

any official statement of the conditions under which they happen, further than the
state of the atmosphere and sea, and the question of whether darkness or daylight
prevailed. Contrary to what might have been supposed, a thick atmosphere does
not increase, but generally markedly decreases the number of collisions ; while, as
might be supposed, the greater number of accidents, and those which are most dis-
astrous, happen at night. It is convenient to confine the attention to these latter.

     It has been found by examining carefully considerable numbers of collision cases

which have been tried in the courts, that in only about 7 per cent, of them were

the ships first seen at a greater angle to the direction of the courses steered than
45░; and in only about 26 per cent, of the cases did the two ships' courses cross at

a greater angle than 45░. The normal condition previous to collision is when the
courses of the two approaching ships are nearly, but not quite, opposite. Collisions
under any other conditions are rare. The conditions of sea traffic make it quite cer-

tain that one or both ships approaching imder these conditions turn towards each
other. But such a movement or movements very rarely indeed precede collision.

On the other hand, the contrary movement of one or both ships turning away from

the other is nearly always found preceding collision.

     Constantly improving experiments have been made to measure exactly in time
and space the movements of ships under the action of their rudders. It is found
                           TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                                     671

that they turn in a path which is a spiral whose least radius is seldom less than

two or three times the lenjrth of the ship.
     Ships are from four to ten times as long as they are hroad. The target a ship offers

to he struck by another, is from four to ten times as large when the broadside is
offered to the blow as when the stern is offered ; and the efiect of the bow of one
ship on the broadside of another is much more destructiTC than wlien bow strikes

bow.
     The movement of a ship in turning mvay fi-om another which is crossing her

course from ahead imder the ordinary conditions precedent to collision, tends to pre-

sent the maximum, and the most tender target to be struck, and it destroys the possi-

bility of reversing a wrong movement. The movement in turning totvrinh a ship
under like conditions tends to present the minimum and the least tender target.

    No idea could be more natural to the unreflecting tlian to suppose that turning
away fi-om an approaching danger was the proper way to avoid it. What alone

makes this dangerous are the limits by which the manojuvring powers of ships are
controlled ; and the fact that their transverse section is so very much smaller than

their longitudinal section.

     It is the same with these opposite movements in fogs. The tendency of the

seaman is to turn away from the fog-signal which denotes on his right or left an

approaching ship, but such a movement is always a precedent of collision.

Minor causes producing a further ultimate cause of collision are found under the

following conditions. Ships approaching one another as described are seldom equally

distant, either in space or time, from the point at which their courses would if produced

intersect ahead of both. If the ships have equal manoeuvring powers, the one which
is farthest from this collision point, as it has been called, is much more capable of

avoidino; a collision than the one which is nearer. If the distance apart of the ships

is small, it becomes absolutely impossible for the ship whicli is nearest to the point

to avoid the other, while it is easy for the ship which is furthest from the point

to avoid the other by turning towards her. The modern law takes no account of

these conditions, which the old rule of the sea fully recognised, and in half the

number of cases forbids, as far as it does anything at all, the ship Avhich alone has

the power, to make the movement which is necessary to their mutual safety.
     Minor proximate causes leading up to and producing these ultimate movements

and conditions, and through them collisions, are found in the multiplicity of dis-

tinctions which exist in the law. The rule of the road at sea has grown to be very

complex, and in the anxious state of mind produced by possible collision, the seaman

sometimes calls up and acts on the wrong rule. No one who has ever been subjected
to this anxiety will readily blame the seaman who makes a mistake.

     Another minor cause proceeds from the complexity and indefiniteness of the
appliances which have grown up under the law. This latter being complex and

various has necessitated differences and distinctions in the lights and signals, not in

themselves necessary and leading to constant mistake. The latest development of

this  complexity  is  for  the  present  in suspense                                                      but it is remarkable that a single
                                                                                                       ;

white light has under the present law no less than four totally different meanings,

and yet if the wrong meaning is attached, a wrong movement and a collision may

follow. In some signals by sound, the timbre of the note is the only distinction, while

there is nothing to prevent that present distinction from becoming obliterated.

The removal of these causes of collision is only difficult in practice. Changes

in rules which are international would be required, but as changes have often been

made before, and even quite recently, while some are still pending, there can be no

real difficulties. If the conditions and movements antecedent to collision were

authoritatively stated and classified, it would be seen to be easy to alter the law so

as to aim directly at their removal.

Nor is it difficult to see what the nature of the change would be. There would

be a i-eturn to the sound rules and teaching of the old law, a removal of the com-
plex distinctions and the complex appliances which the new law has made nece.Фsary,

and a simplicity of rule which would never mislead the seaman called on to act

rightly in moments of supreme surprise and apprehension.

8. On the Engine Poiuer Meter. By C. Vernon Bots.

     The quantity of work done by steam or other fluid on the piston of an engine
is found l)y niiiltiplyin<r at every moment the rate of movement of the piston by
the difference of pressure on its two sides, and continuously adding the products.
This quantity is usually determined in any one complete stroke of an engine by

finding the areas of the indicator diagrams taken at each end of the cylinder, and
adding them together. This is a measure of the whole work done in that stroke.

In the same wav the work done in any other stroke may be determined. If the

en<nne is working any length of time at a uniform rate against a constant load,

tlie total quantity of work done in that time may be found by midtiplyiDg the
number of strokes by the work done in one. Practically this cannot be done
therefore, if it is desired to find the work done during aiiy length of time, some
form of engine-power meter must be used. At the present time, when the efficiency
of machines is attracting so much notice, any advance in this direction is of

importance.

     In the author's instrument the difference of steam-pressure is determined by a
differential pressure gauge, consisting of a piston in a cylinder controlled by a
spring. The two ends of the cylinder communicate by pipes with the two ends of
the cylinder of the engine. This cylinder is separated from the box containing the

calcijating mechanism by an air space, so that heat and dirt are effectually
excluded. The piston rod enters the box at the middle of the base, and passes

through to the top, where the spring is attached which lies in a tube attached to

the top of the box. On the piston rod is a sleeve carrying two pins, one working
in a guide to prevent the sleeve from turning when the piston rod turns slightly,

and the other to give inclination to what is called the tangent wheel. This is a

.small wheel with its edge in contact with the surface of a cylinder which is free to

travel longitudinally and to rotate. If the plane of the tangent wheel is parallel

to the axis of the cylinder, then when the latter moves longitudinally, there will be

no rotation, but if the tangent wheel is inclined, the cylinder will rotate v/itli a
speed proportional to the tangent of the inclination multiplied by the rate of the

longitudinal movement. If the pin on the sleeve of the piston rod works in a

radial slot in the tangent wheel frame, then the tangent of the inclination of the

latter will alwavs be proportional to the displacement of the piston rod, and

Nowtherefore to the difference in pressure in the engine cylinder.  if the integi-at-

ing cylinder is moved in time with, and in proportion to the motion of the engine-

piston, the rate of turning of the integrating cylimler will be proportional to the

rate at which work is being done, and the number of turns shown by a counter
will be a measure of the total amount done during any length of time. There is

no necessity to adjust the tangent wheel to absolute parallelism with the axis of the

cylinder when there is no steam-pressure ; even if considerably inclined, there will

be no accumulating error, for whatever error is introduced during a forward .stroke

is absolutely removed during the return stroke.

recognised position wliieli tlie torpedo-boat liad now attained as an engine of

warfare.

    He then described, in detail, with the aid of models and diagrams, the two

distinct groups into which the various types of torpedo-boats have gradually been

resolved, viz., those attached to and carried by larger vessels, to which they "would

act  as  auxiliaries                                                   and  those   sufficiently  large  to  act  independently,  aiid.  to  a

certain extent, to keep the sea, which would be used for harbour and coast defence.

These two groups have been named, by the English Admiralty, the first and

second-class groups, respectively.

   --The dimensions of the present English second-class boats are: Length, over

all, 08 ft._; beam, 7 It. G in. ; draught of water, 3 ft. 4 in. ; displacement, 12^ tons.

The hull is constructed of Bessemer steel, galvanised, and is divided into ten com-
partments by means of bvdkheads and half-bulkheads. The machinery consists of
a pair of compound surface condensing-engines, having cylinders 8^ in. and 13 in.
diameter respectively, by 8 in. stroke; giving 150 indicated horse-power at a

speed of 653 revolutions per minute, corresponding to 17-65 knots per hoiu-, the

maximum measured-mile speed attained by these boats. The surface condenser is

of copper, tinned inside, and the condensing water is supplied by means of a

centrifugal pump 8 in. diameter, driven by a separate engine. The boiler is of the

locomotive type, the shell being made of steel with a copper fire-box and brass

tubes, strong enough to withstand a water-pressure of 260 lbs., and a working

66pressure of 130 lbs. per sq. in. The area of the fire-grate is                                                      sq. ft., and the

heating surface 2(38 sq. ft. The stokehold is entirely enclosed, and the air is

supplied to the boiler by means of a fan, driven by an independent engine, which

at a speed of 800 revolutions per minute gives a pressure of fi-om 2 to 3 in. of

water. The stokers are kept cool and comfortable by the large volume of air

passing through, and to provide for their safety the fire-door of the boiler is made

to shut tight                                                    the   ash-pan  is  cased  in  with a light  casiug,  having  flaps in front

from the bursting of a tube or other sudden leakage in the boiler; and an escape,

By means of a nozzle fitted into the bottom pa'rt of the barrel of the boiler, and a

pipe carried to the deck, the boiler of the boat can be connected with the ship's

boiler, and a steam-pressure of 60 lbs. raised in about 9i minutes, by which time

the fiin, also driven by the borrowed steam, has brought "the fire into condition to

maintain that pressure.

     These boats are fitted with an ejector in the stokehold, capable of ejecting 45

tons of water per hour. The centrifugal pump can be utiUsed for emptying the

bilges, and the two together would eject the whole displacement of the boa'ts every
ten minutes. The lifting weight of the boats all on board is ]2|- tons, and the

lifting is eftected by means of slings, attached to hoops on the bidkheads forward

of the boiler-room and aft of the engine-room.

     The second-class boats, built or building by tlie author's firm for the Danish
and Italian Governments, are substantially the same as the English second-class in

Imll, engines and boilers ; but in the Danish boats the pumping is done by ejectors

alone, six of which are fitted in different parts of the boat, and are capable of

ejecting the whole displacement every 6f minutes. The ease and readiness with
which an ejector can be turned on in any compartment without the necessitv of
communicating with the engine-room are a strong recommendation in favour of that
method of pumping. All second-class boats now carry two 14-in. Whitehead torpe-
does, and the Danish and Italian also carry two-barrelled Gardner machine-guns.

     There are three methods of ejecting the torpedoes. The earlier English'" boats
are fitted with davits and di.'=charging frames, so arranged that the frames can be
lowered over the side, close to the boat and parallel to its centre line, to a depth of
2 ft. under the surface of the water. In this system no external impulse is used-
the pulling of a lanyard liberates the torpedo and starts its engine.

     This sy.stem has been superseded in the later English boats, in which the

torpedoes are laid all ready for discharging in two troughs on the forward part of

the deck, and are projected therefrom by means of two pistons and rods working

in steam cylinders 4j in. diameter, by 7 ft. stroke. This system has given excellent
results in experiments at Portsmouth.

     In the later Danish and Italian boats the troughs have been replaced by tubes
from which the torpedoes are ejected by compressed air stored in reservoirs and
admitted into the tubes behind the torpedoes. Besides other advantages possessed
by the air-impulse system, so long as the reservoirs and torpedoes are charged, the

boats may be used independently of steam being up in their boilers, and v^'ould thus
serve as so many launcliing tubes on the ships to which they are attached.

     Coming to the first-class boats, these, in general construction, hull, engines,
and boilers, resemble the second-class type, but are, of course, on a larger scale.

   --The dimensions of most of the Admiralty first-class boats are : Length over

all, 87 ft. ; beam, 10 ft. 10 in. ; draught of water, 5 ft. 2 in., with a displacement
of 32"4 tons. That, however, represented by the model was 90 ft. 6 in. over all,
by 10 ft. 10 in. beam, and, like the rest, was fitted with engines having cylinders
121 and 20| in. respectively in diameter by 12 in. stroke, which, on trial, gave
indicated horse-power 469 at 443 revolutions per minute and speed 21f knots
per hour.

      The Italian type of first-class boat is 100 ft. long, 11 ft. 8 in. beam, and has a
draught of water of 5 ft. 5 in., and 34"5 tons displacement. The cylinders are also
somewhat larger, being 13^ and 22 in. diameter, respectively ; the boUers are also
larger, having a grate surface of 19'4 sq. ft., and a heating surface of 698'8 sq. ft.

     The subdivision of the hulls by bulkheads and half-bulkheads is similar to that
 in the second-class boats, and ejectors are similarly fitted. The six ejectors of the
 Italian boats are alone capable of pumping out the whole displacement in 7J
 minutes. In the Italian boats all the pumps are driven by a separate engine, and
 the main engines are devoted entirely to propelling the boat.

      The English first-class boat carries three 14-in. Whitehead torpedoes, two in
 transporting carriages on the sides of the vessel, and one in the torpedo gun, as

 it has been called, on the forward deck. By means of this gun, which can be
 elevated or trained like an ordinary gun, the torpedo may be projected ahead or on

 either side. Hence there is no necessity for attacking bows on, as in the second-
 class boats, or for stopping immediately before or after the discharge. In the
 earlier examples, the torpedo was ejected by an air-impulse gear ; now, a cartridge,
 containing a slow-burning powder, is used.

   --The objections to this system are that the boat cames to the attack only one

 torpedo ready to be ejected ; that the gun cannot be reloaded without retiring, or

 else exposing the men engaged in the operation to great danger ; and the reserve

 torpedoes are liable to be hit by Nordenfeldt buUets or Hotchkiss shell, either of
 which would certainly disable them, and might even cause a destructive explosion.

      The Italian and Danish boats carry four 14-in. "NVliitehead torpedoes, arranged

 --as in their second-class boats, that is two in the ejecting tubes, and two in the

  loading troughs, immediately behind, but in this case all are completely enveloped

 in the hull of the boat. To reach them, a bullet would have to penetrate 35 in. of
  plating, and | in. of tube, in all ^t: in. The torpedo is ejected by an air-impulse
  gear, similar to that already described, the air for which and for the torpedoes is
 supplied at a pressure of 70 atmospheres by a small air-compressing pump in the

  engine-room.

     A permanent lifting gear, similar to that of the second-class boats, has recently

  been fitted to these boats, and the first two of them, weighing about 28 tons each,
  were shipped in an hour and a half

       The largest torpedo-boat built by the author's firm, and the large.st yet afloat,
  is that lately supplied to the Danish Government. She is 110 ft. long by 12 ft.
  beam, draws 6 ft. 3 in. of water, and has a displacement of 52^ tons. Her speed
  on the three hours' trial was 20 knots per hour, and she carries coal (10 tons) to
  steam 1,200 knots at a speed of about 11 knots. Her armament consists of four
  15-in. Whitehead torpedoes, 19 ft. in length, and carrying a charge of 80 lbs. of
  gun-cotton. The Danish Government propose to caiTy this boat and others of her
  class from point to point of the coast on their railways, so that an en╗my would
  know nothing of their movements or where to expect them.

   A still larger boat is under construction for the Russian Government ; she will

be 113 ft. long by 12 ft. 6 in. beam, with a displacement of 58^ tons. Her contract
speed is the same as that of the Danish boat, but will be obtained under severer

conditions, "to secure that the trial trip speed shall be maintained on actual service.

     Relatively to the Whitehead torpedo, the Spar torpedo must be considered as

a torpedo with a spar 10 yards, as compared with one having a spar 400 yards

long, that being the range at which the Whitehead torpedo may be considered
tolerably effective. Yet the Spar torpedo is not to be looked on as obsolete, and in
the hands of a seafaring population, trained to the use of torpedo-boats, it would

prove most efiicient. In circumstances such as prevailed at the bombardment^ of
Alexandria, when the attacking ships were so enveloped in smoke that the firing

 had to be suspended, it is a question whether the Spar torpedo would not have
been both the most certain and the least hazardous weapon of attack. The

English first-class boats are now being armed with the Spar torpedo as an

alternative armament.

In conclusion, the author pointed out the importance of a properly-organised

torpedo service for coast defence botli at home and in our colonies, and particularly

for our scattered coaling stations, which, in the exigencies of a great war, might

Abe left a prey to any adventurous captain.  disaster to our navy, or the_ calls

that might be made upon it in a great war, might leave our harbours and navigable

rivers temporarily exposed to the attack of an enemy, and although no one would

propose that torpedo boats should take the place of forts and land defences, yet the

knowledge of their presence, and the risk of being struck at any moment in his

most vulnerable part, would compel an enemy to approach our forts with far
greater circumspection than was considered necessary in encountering the heavy

guns of the Alexandrian batteries.

3. Current Meter Observations in Hie Tidal Compartment of the Thames.

                    By Professor W. C. UxwiN, M.I.C.E.

    These observations were made witli the object of testing a new form of current
meter made by Messrs. Anisler Latl<Mi. of Schatfhausen, and also to examine how

far current meter observations could ' e usefully carried out in a tidal river.

The current meter is a screw cunv nt meter, differing from those ordinarily used

in the mode of suspension, and in h:-. lug an electrical signalling arrangement. The
Ameter is carried in gimbals and is fiee to move in any direction.
                                                                      long conical

Apended in the water by a steel wire ^\ith a weight of 40 kilogrammes below it.

small crab or winch for lowering out or raising the meter carries an index, show-

ing the exact depth of the meter from the water surface. The author found the

arrangement to work extremely well, the conical rudder appeared to have adequate

directing power and the meter held i' s proper position in the water with very great

steadiness. At every 100 rotations of the screw, an electrical circuit is made which

rings a bell above water. To obtain t1ie rate of rotation, it is therefore only neces-

sary to note the time of 100 or 200 or .500 revolutions by a chronograph stop-watch.

The velocity of the water is obtained fmm the number of rotations observed, by a

suitable formula, with constants deirnuined by previous experiments.

      In ordinary river gauging, the difficulty of obtaining accurate restdts arises,
chiefly, from the variations of velocit at each point due to the unsteady motion of

the water and the eddies superpose! 'H the general forward motion. In a tidal
stream, there is the additional diffioul . that the velocity is periodically varying with

the continuous change of the depth ..^ 1 surface slope. 'That observations in a tidal

stream should be of any use therefore, it is very necessary that they should be made

with considerable rapidity. In the e:, . iraents here described the author took entire
charge of the current meter, alterin^ и:- position, noting the time, and recording the

revolutions himself Nevertheless '.n the average of six days' work, one velocity

was obtained on the average every tin oe minutes, a degree of rapidity very satis-

factory.

   The observations were all taken - ^ nj? vertical, in water varying with the phase

                                                   metres in depth. The observations were taken
sometimes at every metre of depth, but more generally at 0-5 metre below the sur-
face, at mid depth, and at 0-2 metre above the bottom. The position of the metre
in depth was changed after each observation. Curves were shown giving the
velocities near the surface, at mid-depth, and at the bottom daring two ebb tides and
during a period extending from the end of one ebb, through the period of flow, and

into the next period of el)b.

     The calculation of the discharge of the river at different periods, and its com-
parison with the amount of upland water, cannot be given without tables, but the

following general facts are interesting.

     1. The change in the river-depth at the turn of the tide begins markedly
earlier than the change in the direction of flow.

     2. The relation of the surface and subsurface velocities is similar to tliat in a
non-tidal river at all periods of ebb and flow.

     3. The velocities could not be observed exactly at the turn of the tide, but
within a very short period after that instant the bottom water was in motion witli
a velocity bearing the same relation to the surface velocity as at other periods of

the tide.

     4. The change of velocity for the half-hour before and after the turn of the tide

is extremely rapid.

     The observations were made at Putney and "\\'ostminster, and the greatest
velocities observed were a little less than one metre per second.

4. An Apparatusfor recording the results of experiments with Railway Brakes.

                         By Sir Frederick Bramwell, F.B.S.

     This apparatus mainly consists of a train of wheelwork set in motion by a
spring, which can be wound up by hand. The motion of the wheelwork causes a
continuous strip of paper, of about an inch in width, to travel endways at a regular
speed, under a pencil moved alternately to the right and to the left, at right angles
to the direction of motion of the paper, the motion of the pencil being produced
by connection with an axle of tlie locomotive drawing the train to which the
brakes are attached, a motion of the pencil to the right, and one to the left, being
made for each revolution of the axle. It is essential that the axle giving motion
to the pencil should neither be driven by the engine nor should its wheels have
brakes upon them.

   A second pencil is provided, capable of being moved by hand, also at right

angles to the direction of motion of the paper. Each of the pencils can be placed
in contact with, or removed from, the paper at the will of the operator.

     The mode of working is as follows :

     The apparatus being lixed on the locomotive, and the pencil coupled up with
the rod of an eccentric placed on the axle, the spring controlling the wheelwork is
wound up, and the continuous strip of paper set in motion. Then the pencil
is put into contact with the strip of paper, and as the paper moves endways, the
pencil makes a series of marks upon it, each of these representing one revolution
of the axle, and each representing therefore a forward motion of the locomotive,
and of the carriages attached to it, equal to the circumference of the wheels on
that axle. The speed at which the paper moves was regulated when the apparatus
was constructed, but this speed is ascertained, with absolute accuracy, for each
experiment by means of the hand-worked pencil making a second mark upon
the paper, and being moved alternately to the right and to the left at any interval

of time.

     Upon the signal for the shutting off of the steam and the putting on of the
brakes being given, a further mark is made by the hand-worked pencil, and this
pencil is kept at its then position until the locomotive and the carriages attached
to it have come to rest, when a further mark in the opposite direction is made.

    Upon considering the diagram thus produced it will be seen that it shows
     1st. The number of revolutions of the driving wheel, and therefore the distance

travelled, and the speed during any given space of time before the brakes are
put on,

     2nd. The time that has been occupied in bringing the locomotive and the car-
riages to rest after the brakes are put on ; and

     3rd. The number of revolutions that have been made by the engine, and there-

fore the distance travelled during this time.
      These are all the necessary elements for recording the efficiency in ' stopping

power ' of any railway brake. The weight of the locomotive and of the carriages
attached to it being known, the speed at which they are travelling when the brakes
are put on ; the time which it takes to bring them to rest ; and the distance over
which they travel after the brakes are put on, can all be obtained from the diagram.

     The author gave an account of certain experiments carried out by him with
the view of ascertaining the pressure on the bottom of the tall bins in which corn
is frequently stored. The result of these experiments showed that, after the corn
had reached a certain height in the bin, the weight of any further additions was
taken by the sides of the bin and caused no increased pressure on the bottom.

imTie              ot Bishop Wilbertoroe.

FROM THE YEAR i860 TO HIS DEATH IN 1873.

                   By his Son, REGINALD G. WILBERFORCE.

IVii/i Portrait and an Index to the entire Work. %vo. \^s.

" He was a consummate ecclesiastic politician, and long before he died he had been acknow-

Jedged leader of the Episcopate. The Bishop has drawn his own portrait with a hand

unconscious of its work, and in a manner which extorts success. His private diary is a record

of great interest  in it we see more of the man himself and less of his public character, and

we are led to a more kindly estimate of the Bishop's acts and purposes, of his struggles and

sorrows, of his failures and successes." The Times.

difficult and obscure history of the animal of which it treats." Times.
