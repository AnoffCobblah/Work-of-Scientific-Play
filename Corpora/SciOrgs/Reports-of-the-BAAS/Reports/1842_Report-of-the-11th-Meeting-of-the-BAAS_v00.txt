                  ADDRESS

                                               BY

THE REV. PROFESSOR WHEWELL, F.R.S., &c.

--Gentlemen, It now becomes my business to take upon myself the office

of President of the British Association, in virtue of my election to that

situation, which took place at the meeting at Glasgow last year in the usual

form. The election was made in my absence, and contrary to ray expecta-

tion ; but of my own views and feelings with regard to the widdoni of the

choice then made, I shall not say one word. I will only remark, that any

apprehension which I may entertain of my own unfitness for this office, and

of the superior claims of others to the distinction, will have no other effect

than that of making me more diligent and scrupulous in the discharge of my
official duties, since those are the merits which are most within my reach,

and for the want of which no eminence, either in science or in society, can

compensate. It cannot but occur to those who are acquainted with the pro-

ceedings of the Association in past years, that it would be agreeable to the

general course of its usage, if this Chair were occupied by some illustrious

man of science  belonging  to  this  region  of  England                                        (the region does not
                                                                                             ;

want for such as by their powers and their European reputation might fitly

be placed at the head of any scientific association in the world) or again, if

it were occupied by some of those men of eminent rank and influence in the

district and in the empire, who have shown, by their attendance here and by

their services rendered to this meeting, their approbation of the objects of

the British Association, and their good will towards its members. But if

you had met under a President whose claims to your attention, however

high, were of a merely local nature, while at the same time no one of the

primary officers of the last meeting, the President and Vice-Presidents, were

present, to transmit into his hands, by a visible act, the dignity of which I

have the honour now to be the temporary holder, it might seem as if the

--continuity of the Association had been interrupted, as if this were rather a

new institution, arising in this district, than a new meeting of a body which

Myhas had, now for eleven years, a connected and unbroken existence.

hand may serve at least to transmit the torch from one place of assemblage

--to another, to bring the sacred fire which has been lit and kept alive at the

former meetings of our body, and to place it upon the altar which has been

erected in this great maritime town. On one account, at least, I may ven-

ture to undertake such a ministry as this : I have been a faithful attendant

upon the meetings of the Association ever since its first institution, and there

is scarcely any subordinate oflSce of labour or dignity in the constitution of

the body which I have not at one place or other discharged, with such zeal

and care as was in my power. However the Council may have judged well

or ill in this selection, they have at least this excuse, that they have not gone

--out of their way to make it, that they have not placed in this liigh office of

the Association one whose willingness to serve it, and to be for the time

identified with it, was at all doubtful, so far as past events could prove it.
xxviii  --REPORT 1841.

    In proceeding to the business of the Association, it is not uiy intention to

attempt to give you any account of tlie arrangements and prospects of the pre-

sent meeting, nor of the proceedings of the last, and tlie transactions of the

intermediate time. In several preceding years, there has been laid before the

first General Meeting of the Association a statement of the main contribu-

tions to science, which were included in the recent Proceedings of the body,

-- a survey and estimate of the scientific work done during the twelvemonth.

This is a task always difficult, and sometimes long ; and I believe many of
you, who know the character which it almost necessarily assumes, of a col-

lection of abridgments of papers on abstruse points of science, will not regret

its being occasionally omitted. But perhaps I may be allowed to occupy you

for a few minutes with a slight sketch of the general aspect which the Asso-

--ciation now appears to me to offer to a thoughtful spectator ; of the place

it holds among the characteristics, and I may say, the institutions of our time
and country. Such a view of our position may serve to remind us of our
duties to the Association, and to the gi'eat cause Avhich it represents, and may

guide and animate us in the discharge of them.

   Those of you who are acquainted with the writings of the greatest of

our philosophers, are aware that several of them, contemplating the past
progress and future prospects of science in that spirit of comprehensive
thought and large hope, which the subject so strongly calls for, have imagined
some vast Institution, by which the advance of science should be systemati-

--cally and powerfully aided ; some great Philosophical College, which should

--have for its business, not to teach mainly, but to make discoveries to extend

our knowledge of every part of nature by all the appliances which experi-
ment and theory, observation and calculation, ingenuity and perseverance,
can supply ; and in addition to these, by more material resources, money and

a multitude of fellow-labourers. You recollect, perhaps, the great Bacon's

remarkable picture of the New Atlantis. The imaginary teacher, whom he

introduces as one of the sages of this Utopian region, describes to the in-
quiring traveller an institution which he calls Solomons House, and which is

such a college for making discoveries as we- have just spoken of. Of this
institution, he says, " The end of our foundation is the knowledge of causes
and secret motions of things, and the enlarging the bounds of the human
empire to effecting of things possible." As parts of this house, there are

described caves and wells, chambers and towers, baths and gardens, parks
and pools, dispensatories and furnaces, and many other provisions for experi-
ment and observation. There are also many classes of persons who conduct
the business of this college, and whom, according to their employments, he
calls by somewhat fanciful names merchants of light ; mystery men ; depre-
dators ; pioneers, or miners ; compilers ; doivry men, or benefactors ; lamps ;
inoculators ; and finally, interpreters of nature, who elevate the truths of ex-

periment into general laws, the highest forms of human knowledge.
    Other philosophical writers have presented, in various ways, somewhat of

the same conceptions. But, you will perhaps say, all this is mere imagination.
Such an institution exists only in Utopia : it Avas never contemplated as a
reality. True : it is ideal, just as all the highest forms of human institutions

are ideal. It is Utopian, just as a perfect monarchy, perfectly administered,
is Utopian. But if Ave conceive a perfect monarchy, where the sovereign
has unlimited power, which he exercises with entire wisdom and justice, while
the resources of the state are ample, and the character of the nation is intel-

lectual and progressive, must we not, in such an Utopia, include also the
notion of such a college of discovery ? Beyond all doubt, if we imagine to

ourselves a New Atlantis, we must also place in it a Solomon's House. Still,

--you will say, all is imaginary and to what use do we feed our minds with

these empty pictures of unattainable good? To what use, do you ask?

Some of you, well aware that, in the constitution of man, imagination and

-- --hope, the boldest imagination, the loftiest hope, are not without their use

-- aware what that use is, have already answered this question in your own

hearts. Of what use are the ideal pictures of objects that tend to elevate

and improve the condition of man ? Of that use, which, if we disregard, the

condition of man forthwith becomes degraded, and his prospects a blank.

They are of use in raising our thoughts and stimulating our exertions, so

that we may become Aviser, and better, and nobler than we are. Is this a

--new doctrine ? God be thanked, in this country at least, it has long been

familiar to men's minds has been practically acted upon, and has been

attended with the most blessed and glorious effects. Let us look to other

objects, very different from the increase of knowledge, and we shall easily

discern the operation of this doctrine. It is not difficult to see in what form

we may expect to find it showing itself. For if we imagine this Utopia of a

perfect government, Solomon's House will not be the only ideal institution

there. In such a land of justice, and wisdom, and religion, we shall have

colleges for diffusing justice, and wisdom, and religion over the face of the

Weearth.  shall have a college for teaching the poor, a college for repress-

ing the vicious, a college for the abolition of slavery, a college for diffusing

Christianity over the face of the globe. Such colleges we should have in our

--Utopia but Utopia is not. What then ? do we therefore despair of these

great objects ? Do we sigh to think that all this contemplated good is mere
imagination ? Do we lament that we are not in an absolute monarchy,

where the wisdom of the sovereign, supported by unlimited power, might

Docall into existence those beneficial institutions ?    we despair of these

great and good objects, because we live in a state of society where men act

each for himself, unforced by supreme power ? Do we cast away our ideas,

because we are not likely to be carried towards their realization by the whole

power of the state ? Do we do this ; or do we not do something very dif-

Weferent ? Something very different indeed we do.  still keep our thoughts

fastened upon our ideas of what is highest and best ; but feeling that we are

free, and that it is our glorious privilege to act as freemen, we attempt to

realize our ideas, not by the power of the state, but by that power which, in

such a state and on such subjects, represents the conviction of the nation, the
We --power of voluntary association.
                                      have had thus, not state colleges, but
--voluntary societies, for Christianizing the Heathen, for teaching the igno-

rant, for repressing the vicious ; and we had a voluntary Society for the Abo-

lition of Slavery, till the principle of voluntary association, in that instance,

thank God I performed its work even to the end, by inducing the State to take

up and carry into effect the great object which had been the aim of the vo-

luntary society from its foundation.

What, then, is the conclusion to which we are led, by looking at the spirit

of our country, as shown in its most strenuous exertions and most glorious

acts, and combining this view with the loftiest ideal aspirations of the greatest

philosophers the land and the world have produced ? What but this ? that

with regard to that institution, which has for its object to extend the bounds

of human knowledge, we must realize the idea in the same manner as we

--endeavour to realize other ideas in our practice ; that what in a perfect

monarchy would be done by a wise sovereign, we must do by voluntary

--exertion ; that in the place of a Solomon's House supported by the State, we

must have a British Association supported by ourselves.

The British Association has now for ten years discharged the office of such
--XXX REPORT 1841.

an institution as we have spoken of. Considerable funds, raised by the con-

tributions of its members, and expended under its direction, have been em-

ployed in furthering and verifying discoveries. It is true that we have not

attempted to erect such edifices, and to make such preparations for the pui'-
poses of experiment, as Bacon introduces into his picture ; but we have at-
tained the same end more effectually, by procuring the use of many of the

great establishments of manufacture and commerce which this empire pos-

Wesesses.     have had experiments carried on at furnaces and iron-works, on

railroads and canals, in mines and harbours, with steam-engines and steam

vessels, upon a scale which no institution, however great, could hope to reach

but which has been placed in our power by the enlightened liberality and

scientific zeal of the proprietors and directors of such means of research.

We have not had various bodies of professors of the art of discovery em-

--ployed in these inquiries we have not attempted to form classes of mystery
-- --men and dowry men collectors of facts and interpreters of nature ; but we

have found the most gifted and eminent cultivators of science in our own

country, and several of those of other countries, ready and willing to under-

--take for us the office of exploring and interpreting nature of extending and

applying art. No institution, however formed, could have hoped to collect,

as its active members, such a body of philosophers as have gladly come for-

ward to labour for us, and have freely given us the resources of their vast

powers and matured skill. Mathematicians, and astronomers, and geologists,

and chemists, and naturalists, illustrious through Europe, have superintended

the execution of our commissions with as much care as their own most favor-

ite researches ; and we have seen a co-operation of experimenters and cal-

culators, observers and generalizers, such as might satisfy the wishes of Ba-

con himself.

That 1 may not dwell on mere generalities, I will mention a few of the

sums expended by the Association upon scientific researches ; which, when

it is understood that they have been spent under the direction and vigilant

control of such men as 1 have spoken of, will show the amount of service

which has been rendered to science by that body. In the first three years,

the sums thus expended were small, the Association having been mainly em-

ployed in collecting information which might direct its future proceedings.

In the fourth year 167/. was thus spent, and from this time the sum went on

rapidly increasing. In the fifth year it was nearly 500/. ; in the sixth and

seventh nearly 1000/. each year; in the eighth and ninth above 1500/. each

year ; and it appears that during the past year we have expended in this
manner the sum of 1 240/. And these sums, it is to be observed, are only a

part of what were voted ; at Liverpool, in 1 837, above 3000/. was voted, of

which 1000/. only was applied for; at Newcastle 3700/. was voted, and

1600/. of this only paid: at Birmingham 2800/. was voted, and 1500/. paid ;
the sum voted at Glasgow last year was 2600/., of which, as I have said,

your Treasurer has really paid 1240/.

These differences of the sums voted and paid in each year are evidence of

the care with which the resources of the Association are husbanded ; for the

sums voted were to be had on application made by the persons to whom

their disposal was intrusted ; but they were not applied for, except in pro-

portion to the scientific work which was done ; and those who undertook

these labours for us carefully confined their expenditure within the narrowest

possible limits. It would occupy you too long if I were to mention in detail

the subjects to which these sums have been applied ; but I may state in gene-

ral, that above 900/. has been expended by us in the furtherance of astro-

nomy, mainly upon the object of reducing observations already made, into
                        ADDRESS.                            XXXI

such a form that they can be directly compared with the theory. Above

800/. has been expended on tide observations ; 250/. on experiments on waves
500/. on experiments on the best form of vessels ; 200/. on experiments on
cast iron ; about 400/. has been employed in various labours relative to me-
teorology ; and above 300/. on the description of fossil fishes and reptiles. I
shall not detain you by mentioning smaller sums which have been devoted to

various objects ; but I may call to your notice a work executed mainly in
this county, upon which the Association expended about 550/ in 1838 and
1839. This work consisted in striking a level line from the north coast of
Somersetshire to Axmouth, in order to determine whether the level of the
sea is the same in the Bristol Channel and in the British Channel, and in

order to afford a standard of reference in future times, if, from any cause, the
relative level of the land and the sea should change. This operation has
already afforded us the means of determining, that the great land slip, which
has recently taken place near Axmouth, was not accompanied by any per-
manent change in the level of the land itself, where a block of granite lies,
which marks one of the extremities of our level line.

    Since the first institution of the Association, about 7000/. has been ex-
pended on such objects as I have pointed out : but it is impossible for any

one, who knows the nature of scientific researches, and the difference between
the result of money expended in experiments by a good and a bad philoso-
pher, to doubt that this sum has produced effects which many times the sum

applied without the same advantages could not have obtained. Without the
encouragement of the Association, these researches would never have been

undertaken ; without the aid of such men as have frequented the meetings

of the Association, they would have been attempted to no purpose. It has
been said of certain parts of Europe that they afford--

                   Iron and man, the soldier and his sword

in like manner we may say of this Association, that it has supplied at the

same time the philosophical soldier and the weapons with which he gains his

victories over nature.

But further, besides the expenditure of its own funds, the Association has

been the means of procuring the appropriation of very large sums to scientific

purposes from the national resources. At the suggestion or request of this

body, the reduction of the observations of the planets made at Greenwich

from the time of Bradley has been completed ; and the reduction of the ob-

servations of the moon has been begun. Up to the present time, about
2200/. has been expended in all. And by a letter from the Astronomer
Royal, received since I came here, I am informed that, within a few weeks,

the Government expressed great willingness to advance more money for this

purpose ; and Mr. Airy adds, that next Monday he is to have twelve calcu-

Welators employed upon the work.  have applied to the Government for

the extension of the Ordnance Survey into Scotland, and have received a

Wefavourable answer.    have tendered our advice that the Ordnance Survey

of England shall in future be conducted on a larger scale in the mining and

metalliferous districts, and this advice is already acted on in the northern

counties of England, where the survey is now proceeding on a scale of six

inches to a mile.

Above all, I must mention an undertaking, entered upon in pursuance of

--our repeated recommendations (a service which the philosophers of future

ages will duly estimate), the great Magnetical Survey of the terrestrial

globe, by the combined operation of a naval expedition and fixed observa-

--tories in every quarter of the world, which is now carrying into effect ;
XXxii  --REPORT 1841.

--scientific work, this far surpassing, in the scale of its means and in the com-

pleteness of its design, any ever yet attempted, and such as Bacon might

have assigned to the sages of his New Atlantis, if he had, in imagination,

extended their polity from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from Pole to Pole.

  We most gladly bear our testimony to the liberality and spirit with which

Her Majesty's Government have accepted and acted upon our suggestions
nor is this testimony at all weakened by our claiming for distinguished mem-
bers of our own the merit of having brought into view the importance of

such an undertaking, laid before the English public the progress which the

subject was making in other countries, planned the scheme of operations
which our own exertions ought to follow, and animated the observers, by

giving them the certainty that their observations will be well used and fully

appreciated.

   When we can point to these numerous and valuable direct results of our

exertions, we cannot at all waver in our conviction, that those persons acted

in the truest spirit of the age, and of the nation, who, eleven years ago,
framed the design of a voluntary association for the advancement of science

among the subjects of this empire ; and that the liopes and expectations

which such an institution might naturally exercise, have been fully verified by

the course and progress, the labours and successes of the British Association.

I do not doubt that the present Meeting will continue to uphold the cha-

racter of the Association, and will be inferior to none of the preceding in

Wethe value and interest of its proceedings.  are not yet likely to want for

matter to labour upon. The collection of facts and the reduction of them by

various calculations is still required to a vast extent, in order that our know-

ledge may make the next step of progress to which its path invites our hopes.

   It is easy to point out vast fields of research, on which our resources and

our energies may be applied with every prospect of a rapid increase of know-
ledge. For, in fact, how little has been done for science, by the collection

of exact and long-continued series of observations, such as he must have

before him who is to interpret nature I In astronomy, indeed, this has been

done : sovereigns, and nations, and opulent individuals have thought their
wealth well bestowed in providing costly instruments, and rewarding the
astronomer through his daily and nightly toils. The stars have been well

observed from the beginning of civilization ; but, for the purposes of science,

we ought to have observations as careful and as continued of all the other
parts of nature as we have of the stars. The tides, the waves, the winds, and

all the other changes of the air, pressure, temperature, moisture, magnetism,

electricity, chemical changes, and even those of vegetable and animal life,

all these afford materials for researches full of importance and interest. For
these, the time is, perhaps, not yet come, when they can be urged upon

--&governments as a part of their business, in the same way in which astronomy

is; except, perhaps, magnetism, which has already taken its place in our

observatories by the side of astronomy, in our own and other countries.

Those other subjects, then, are fitly cultivated by a voluntary association

such as ours; and the occasions of fitly doing this will doubtless be sug-

gested to us from time to time by our members. On the present occasion, a

distinguished Belgian philosopher, one of our corresponding members (M.

Quetelet), comes to us to invite us to take a part in determining, by extensive

observations, the changes which atmospheric conditions produce in periodical

--phfenomena, such as the times of the leafing and flowering of plants, of the

Hearrival of birds, and the like.  has obtained extensive co-operation in his

own country, and no doubt will find fellow-labourers in ours. Meteorology,

in its largest sense, is a subject which, although great collections of observa-
ABDRESS.  XXXUl

tions have been made, is hardly yet a science : yet the interpreters of this
part of the book ot nature have already begun to spell out some phrases,
which show that the language is not wholly unintelligible ; and here, there-

fore, we may go on hopefully, recollecting always that the collection of facts
is a matter of comparatively small value, except we can also trace in them
some rule or order. The mere gathering of raw facts may be compared to
the gathering of the cotton from the tree. The separate filaments must be
drawn into a connected thread, and the threads woven into an ample web,

before it can form the drapery of science.

  We ought to have meteorological observations and observers distributed

over the face of the globe : and even this would not be enough ; for we wish
to know not only what passes on the earth's surface, but through the whole
depth of the atmosphere ; hence it would be desirable to have observations

--made at elevated points free from the action of the ground such as can only

be attained by the aid of balloons. Such an undertaking has been under the
consideration of a committee during the past year, and a report on the sub-
ject has come before the Physical Section. 1 trust that on this subject you

--will soon hear more. As other subjects on which we still want facts that

is, numerous and systematical collections of facts, and laws deduced from

--facts I may mention the tides of the Pacific, the velocity of sea waves, and

subterraneous temperature. Another class of inquiries well fitted for our
labours, is the determination of the fundamental elements, or constants, of
operations of engineering, as the constants of railroads, steam-engines, and
other works of art, which form part of the wealth and resources of this great
empire. These are already under investigation. The addition of a Section
of Practical Mechanics and Engineering to the previous constitution of the
 Association, which took place at Bristol, showed the interest which such in-

quiries inspire ; and various committees have collected much valuable informa-
tion of this kind, and will, we trust, collect much more.

    There is also another Section of the Association, added to its plan at Cam-

--bridge, which has for its object researches of a highly interesting kind,

 mean the Section of Statistics ; and we trust that there is ample employment
 for this Section, in subjects which can be dealt with in the same calm specu-
 lative spirit as the other sciences which we here cultivate.

    It may, perhaps, sometimes be useful to us to recollect that in many

 statistical subjects, the discussion, and even the collection of facts, is rather

 the office of a legislative than of a scientific body. The wise institutions of

 Bacon's New Atlantis would have assigned to the governors of the land, and

 not to the sages of Solomon's House, the collection of information respecting
 the habits, numbers, and education of the people, where the information is

 such as almost necessarily suggests legislation, or discussions having legisla-

 tion for their natural end, and involving the deepest political and moral con-

 siderations. There may very fitly be voluntary associations, which aim

 directly at improving the intellectual, or moral, or social condition of our

 population ; but we must ever remember that we are an association for a dif-
 ferent purpose, namely, the advancement of science ; and we are bound alike
 by our regard to the prosperity of our body, and by our most solemn and

 repeated declarations, to avoid the storm of opinions which is always raised
 when the parties which aim at social permanence and social progress are
 brought into conflict. The pursuit of scientific truth is, no doubt, a means

 of indirectly elevating man's intellectual and social condition ; but we
 assemble in order to promote the direct pursuit of scientific truth ; and we
 must not turn aside into the more wide and tangled paths of those who make
 its collateral effects their main object. Knowledge is power, we are told.
XXxiv         --REPORT 1841.

Knowledge is power ; but for us, it is to be dealt with as the power of inter-

preting nature and using her forces ; not as the power of exciting the feel-

ings of mankind, and providing remedies for social evils, on matters where

the wisest men have doubted and differed.

   Being the person whose voice is first raised in addressing the meeting of

the Association, I have thought that it was a part of my duty to use the

opportunity in calling to our minds the fundamental character and principles

of our institution. There are other subjects which our constitution directs

us to avoid ; but none perhaps in Avhich there is much danger or need of

Wewarning.    are in no great risk of deviating into literary, or metaphysical,

or theological discussions. Sound metaphysics and literary culture will of

course show themselves in the addresses of those who possess such accom-

plishments, but are no direct objects of our attention. And in like manner,

though we cannot dream of the slightest approach to the discussion of

religious questions, heartfelt and real piety may be apparent even in the

sentiments uttered at an association for the advancement of science. I am

sure that many of you who attended the former meetings of this Association,

must recollect occasions on which men's minds being excited, and yet solem-

nized, by the aspect of the assembled multitudes, and by the lofty views of

nature which our philosophers had to present to them, the thoughtful and

eloquent men who had to address you were carried by a spontaneous impulse,

without plan or premeditation, into elevated strains of religious reflection

showing that those who take the lead in our meetings have their minds so

tuned, that every voice which proclaims the wonders of nature, turns their

thoughts to the Author of nature ; that every new gleam of truth seems to

them an effluence from the eternal fountain of truth. Long may such habits

of thought prevail among the philosophers of this land ; and then we need

not fear but that knowledge, hallowed and elevated by the spirit in which it

--is pursued, will be every way a blessing to man, to his soul as well as to his
--body to his spiritual as well as to his intellectual being.

To those of us who, knowing the institution by our attendance upon it,

and our share in its labours, think thus of its value and its spirit, every new

annual occasion of our coming together must be an occasion of fresh grati-

fication, an agreeable exercise of memory and of hope. In our present

meeting at this place, there are many circumstances to give additional ani-

Wemation to our anticipations of pleasure.  come to a part of the empire

parations have been made for our reception ; and we now see in this assem-

bly, the look of cordial welcome and lively anticipation, of which I would

Wesay more, but that I would beg to leave the subject in abler hands.  hail

with joy and confidence the opening of the Plymouth Meeting of the British

Association.

   Perhaps you will allow me the gratification of saying a word respecting
special personal reasons of my own, which make it a matter of pleasure to
me to find myself here on this occasion. Besides that it brings me to the

society of several valued and cherished friends, whose home is in this part of

England, I have various ties of a scientific nature with this place and this

region. The excellent observations of the tides made in this harbour, have

been the subject of calculations involving considerable labours, which I have
ADDRESS.  XXXV

made or directed : and some curious traits in the laws of tidal phgenomena

here, which were noticed as early as the time of Newton, have, I trust, been

followed out to a tolerably exact determination. An anemometer, which I

had devised, has been erected here, with most valuable improvements, by

Mr. Snow Harris, and has been for some time in operation. And when I
consider, as we may do, this meeting as a meeting peculiarly intended to bring

the Association in contact with the West of England, I find that Cornwall

returns to my thoughts, with all the scientific zeal and intelligence, which
from my own personal intercourse I know to exist among the miners of that

county. Perhaps I have had very unusual opportunities of becoming ac-

quainted with their merits, for in two different years (1826 and 1828), in the
prosecution of certain subterraneous experiments, undertaken in conjunction

with the present Astronomer Royal and other persons, I lived four months

the life of a labouring miner, and learnt how admirable for skill and conduct

is the character of all cleisses of the mining population in that region. If any

of my Cornish friends are within hearing, I gladly bid them God speed, and
claim once more their welcome to the West. And that I may no longer

detain you, to all of you, gentlemen of the British Association, I bid God

speed ; and from all of you, gentlemen of Plymouth and its neighbourhood,
I seem to hear, Welcome to Plymouth

                                     ON

       THE STATE OF SCIENCE.

On the Present State of our Theoretical and Experimental Knowledge

  of the Laws of Conduction ofHeat. By the Rev. Piiii^ip Kell and,

   M.A., F.R.SS. Lond. and Edin., Prof of Math, in the University

   of Edinburgh, late Fellow of Queen's College, Cambridge.

HE1 object of the following report is simply to lay before the Association an

outline of the present state of our theoretical knowledge of the law of trans-

mission of heat by conduction, and to examine how far conclusions deduced

from theory have been tested by experiment. Reports on the general pro-

blem of Radiant Heat have already appeared by Professor Powell * ; and on

the theoretical laws of conduction and radiation, a portion of the subject-

matter of our present question, Mr. Whewell has briefly touched in his report

We< On Magnetism, Electricity, Heat, &c.t'      shall, in consequence, confine

ourselves strictly to our immediate limits, noticing only such other branches

Weof the general theory as bear directly or necessarily on the question.

shall avoid all mention of theoretical investigations, however important in

themselves, which are not capable of being examined rigidly by direct expe-

riment ; nor shall we scruple to pass over the names of a host of illustrious
experimenters on conduction and radiation, when we find that their experi-

ments are not calculated to serve as the immediate test of theory. This pro-

ceeding will materially shorten our labour, and will have the effect of con-

densing into a narrow compass all the remarks we have to make.

   To render wiiat has to be said as clear as possible, the subject-matter has
been arranged under three heads. Two of these are distinctly marked out

by the statement of the object proposed to be effected, and the third is sug-

gested by a consideration of the former two.

  We shall examine, then, I. What is the present state of our theoretical

knowledge of the phsenomena of conduction. W^e are here to seek for the

principles on which the reasoning is based, to inquire what are the axioms of

radiation and conduction, or of the flow of heat, which, from observation,

experiment or analogy, have been assumed to hold true, and to point out the

Weconclusions to which these axioms have led.   have to distinguish between

differing theories, and to contrast with each other some of the most simple of

the results to which they respectively lead. This portion of our subject must,

to a certain extent, be treated historically.

  We shall inquire, H. into the state of experimental investigation, so far as

it has been undertaken with a view to test or to illustrate the conclusions

Wearrived at by theory.  shall examine how the different consequences of

certain hypotheses bear the test thus applied to them, by computing from the

* Report on Radiant Heat in Reports of British Association, vols. i. and ix.

--2 REPORT 1841.

fonnulse the values of the temperature corresponding with the conditions

existing in the experiment, and contrasting the results with the temperatures

actually observed. This critical discussion of the hypotheses will lead us in

the third place

To point out, III. the utter inadequacy of the few experimental facts with

which we are furnished, to serve either as the basis of a true theory or as the

Weindication of a false one.  admit that, of a theory based on assump-

tions which have been for a century regarded as only approximative to trul h,

the experiments are sufficient to expose the incompetency, just as experi-

ments on bodies sliding under the retardation of friction will easily detect thje

inadequacy of formulae deduced from the hypothesis of absolute smooth-

ness. But we shall see that, as applicable to point out errors in the assumed

axioms on which reasonings are founded to constitute a physical theory, the

experiments we possess are defective both in their number and in their na^

Weture.  shall find three distinct theories equally verified or equally over-

turned by them, according as we choose to regard the conclusions as indi-

cating the one or the other ; and yet we are quite sure that only one of the

theories is the correct one, whilst on the other hand we can hardly entertain

a doubt that one of them is so. When we shall have made this appear, it

will only remain for us to point out, in conclusion, what are the most im-
portant results of theory which it is desirable that experiment should be

brought in to test, and to suggest a few of the most simple means of effecting

the object desired.

   I. The problem, in the solution of which consists the mathematical theory
of heat, is the following. Having given the state of heatijig, or the variation
of that state from time to time, at one or more points of a homogeneous body
of given form and dimensions, to find the permanent or variable temperature
at every other point. Thus a ring is kept at a certain temperature at one

point, and it is proposed to discover, 1. what is the variation from time to

time of the temperature at every other point, and 2. what is the ultimate

temperature to which that at any given point ai^proaches as the time during
which the constant heating of one point has been kept up is increased.

   From this statement it will appear that the experimental facts on which the

theory must rest are the answers to the following questions, a. According
to what law does a heated body lose its temperature to the air, or other me-
dium or space, by which it is surrounded ? h. According to what law is

temperature transmitted fi'om point to point of a body ? On the correctness
of the answers which may be assumed as given to these questions depends

the applicability of the results obtained to the state of things in nature. But
as in mechanics we may reason correctly on assumed laws which are not laws
of nature, and obtain conclusions of great importance as approximations to

facts, so in the theory of heat the results, although strictly commensurate only
with the laws on which they depend, are still highly important even in refer-

ence to the things actually existing, differing as they do in certain cases from

the expression of the laws.

  We proceed then to show what answers have been given to the above

questions by different theorists, and to explain the evidence on which their
truth is supposed to be established.

   a. Radiation, Sir Isaac Newton appears to have been the first who was
led to apply a law of radiation to experiment. The statement of the law is
given by him for the first time in a paper in the Philosophical Transactions

for 1701 *, and is reprinted in his Opusculaf.

tures ; he is comparing, for instance, the heat of boiling water with that of

the human body. The comparison is made immediately, to the extent to

which the thermometer affords an indication of the temperature ; beyond this

it is requisite to have recourse to some process which involves computation

and to this end Newton admits the hypothesis, to which we apply the de-

signation given above. His words are as follows (translated) : " This table

was constructed by the use of a thermometer and red-hot iron. By means

of a thermometer I found the measure of the heat up to the point at which

tin {stannum) is melted, and by heated iron I found the measure of the rest.

For the temperature which heated iron communicates to cold bodies con-

tiguous to it, in a given time, is as the total temperature of the iron. There-

fore, if the times of cooling are taken in arithmetical progression, the tem-

peratures will be in geometrical progression, and may be found by a table of

logarithms."

It is affirmed by most modern writers that Newton was led to this law by

experiment. This was very probably the case, for to the extent of tempera-

ture indicated by his thermometer it would be very nearly verified.

   The inaccuracy of this law was first pointed out by Martine*. He found,

that although it appears very exact when the temperature of the heated body

does not differ much from that of the surrounding air, yet when the tempera-

tures differ considerably it is very far from being the case. Erxlebenf also

proved that the law is at fault \n proportion to the excess of the temperature

of the body. Mr. DaltonJ, in his ' New System of Chemical Philosophy,' ia

a truly philosophical manner attempted to re-establish the law of Newton by

altering the thermometric scale. The hypothesis on which he bases his views

MM.is, that the dilatation of all liquids is subject to the same law.          Dulong

and Petit conceive that Dalton's views are untenable, arguing that, " even

supposing the accuracy of the principles of this new scale to have been proved,

we should be constrained to acknowledge that it does not satisfy the con-

dition of rendering the losses of heat of a body proportional to the excess of

its temperature above that of the air which surrounds it, or, in other words,

that it does not re-establish the law of Richmann § ; for it would be necessary

in that case that the law of cooling should be the same for all bodies, and our

                                                                                                                ."

experiments rigorously prove the contrary
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ||
  We presume MM. Dulong and Petit's argument to be based, not, as would

appear from the phrase quoted, on the variability of the law of cooling, so

much as on the fact that for different substances the two portions whose sura,

according to these authors, constitutes the law, are affected with very different

multipliers; so that their relative values depend altogether on the nature of

the body. To this matter we shall return in the sequel^.

M. de la Roche of Geneva** likewise pointed out the deviation from New-

ton's law, at the same time admitting that it is sufficiently accurate to 212°

Fahr., which is perhajis rather more than subsequent discoveries warrant us

in assuming.

  We come now to the time when the law was established in its correct form,

so far as we can see at present. The whole merit of the discovery is due to

MM. Daloiig and Petit, to whom the Academy of Sciences awarded the

prize in 1818, and whose admirable memoir ' On the Measure of Tempera-

ture and the Laws of Communication of Heat' the reader will do well to con-

sult*. All that we can do is to give a very brief outline of their researches.

The first step requisite for them to take was the determination of a correct

measure of temperature. To present to the eye an indication of the state of
heat of a body the principle of dilatation has been most commonly applied,

but it becomes a question to ascertain what substance will by its dilatation

MM.express the state of heat the most simply.  Dulong and Petit, having

determined "that all the gases dilate absolutely in the same manner and by

the same quantity for the same change of temperature," conclude that the air-
thermometer is the best indicator of the state of heat. They argue, " that the

well-known uniformity in the principal physical properties of all the gases,

and particularly the perfect identity of the laws of their dilatation, renders it

very probable that in this class of bodies the disturbing causes have not the

same influence as in solids and liquids, and that, consequently, the changes

in volume produced by the action of heat upon them are more immediately

dependent on the force which produces them. It is therefore probable (they

think) that the greater number of the phsenomena relating to heat will pre-

sent themselves under a more simple form if we measure the temperatures on

the air-thermometer. It is at least by these considerations (they inform us)

that we have been determined constantly to employ this scale t-" Having

thus settled that the air-thermometer is to be taken as the measure of tem-

perature, they proceeded in the next place to obtain the laws of cooling in

vacuo. And here we cannot but express our regret that the original unre-

duced observations of the authors are not presented to the world in some

Wework generally known.  have never seen them, nor are we sure that they

Wehave been published at all.  take the present opportunity of further ex-

pressing our astonishment that experiments on which so much depends have

Wenever been repeated in this country.  do not know any more desirable

exercise of the funds and energies of public scientific bodies than the repe-

tition of all experiments, and the institution of others in a trying form, on

which laws of nature have been partially or totally founded. In the case

before us we do not doubt the accuracy or fidelity of the ingenious experi-

ments, but we wish to be assured by cumulative evidence that the constant

introduced into their law is determined with sufficient accuracy. To return

from this digression.

The velocity of cooling was experimented on by our authors by means of

heated thermometers placed in a balloon nearly free from air ; but the ob-

servations were subjected to two corrections. In the first place the stem of

the thermometer without the balloon soon becomes cooled down to the tem-

perature of the surrounding air. Every temperature observed therefore was

too low by a number of degrees equal to that to which the mercury in the

stem would dilate, when heated from the temperature of the surrounding

Aatmosphere to that of the bulb.  correction on this account was applied to

all the temperatures observed. The second correction was destined to re-

duce the observations actually made on the mercurial thermometer to the

corresponding indications of the air-thermometer. Besides these corrections,

rendered requisite by the nature of the experiments, there was a third which

arose out of the necessary imperfection of the vacuum. This was applied to

the resulting velocities, and its value was ascertained by making correspond-

ing experiments on vacuums of different degrees of imperfection, and tlience
computing the amount of error introduced by the action of a known quantity

of air.

   The result to which our authors arrived is expressed by the following law.

" When a body cools in vacuo, surrounded by a medium whose temperature

is constant, the velocity of cooling for excesses of temperature in arithmetical

progression increases as the terms of a geometrical progression, diminished

by a constant quantity." The formula which expresses the velocity of cool-

ma --ing is
        {a l), where a is the same for all bodies, viz. 1*0077 or

^°/ri65, denotes the temperature (marked by the air-thermometer and

measured on the centigrade scale) of the vacuum in which the cooling body

--is placed, and I the excess of the temperature of the body above 9.
   On cooling in air or in gases. The hypothesis on which was computed

the velocity of cooling in air or any other gas, was, that the velocity might

--be divided into two parts ; the one, that due to direct radiation in vacuo
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

the other, that due to the actual presence of the gas. The gas was supposed

not to influence directly the process of radiation, but to act in aid of it by

MM.conduction or convection, or a combination of both. Proceeding thus,

Dulong and Petit first verified the observation of Leslie, " that the loss of

heat owing to the contact of a gas is independent of the state of the surface
of the body which cools." They showed next, " that the velocity of cooling
of a body, owing to the sole contact of a gas, depends for the same excess of
temperature on the density and temperature of the gas ; but this dependence
is such that the velocity of cooling remains the same so long as the elasticity is
unaltered" They found also, "that the cooling power of a gas is, cceteris pa-
ribus, proportional to a certain power of its elasticity, but that the index of
the power varies for different gases;" and moreover, "that the velocities of

cooling due to a gas increase in geometrical progression as the excesses of

temperature increase in geometrical progression."

  We shall best understand the whole law of cooling by exhibiting it in the

shape of a single formula. It is as follows :

- mY -m.. 1-0077^ (1-0077^ 1) n-{- eP h^'^^^, where depends on the

pnature of the surface, and n and on the nature of the gas.  is, as before,

+the temperature of the gas, and  S that of the cooling body ; e, the elas-

ticity of the gas.

If this be the law of nature, we can hardly term by the same word radiation

the loss of heat in vacuo, and the loss due to the action of the surrounding

Weair.  must therefore, for the present, confine our signification of this

term to the former, and admit that results deduced from the hypothesis of

radiation apply only to experiments carried on in a space free from air.

b. Conduction. Ordinary experience teaches us that the power of con-

duction differs in different substances ; and it is natural to suppose, and has,

in fact, been universally admitted, that this difference is a difference in in-
tensity only. It is assumed that one and the same law holds good for all
bodies, but that a certain factor, on which the absolute amount of conduction
depends, differs accoi'ding to the nature of the substance. But to define the
law of conduction, which is the same for all substances, considerable diffi-
culty has been experienced. Lambert*, and the other early writers on the

subject, regarded the flow of heat as the flow of a fluid. But when we treat

the subject mathematically, and regard the flow of heat as the flow of an

                    * Act. Helvet., vol. ii. p. 172.
--6 REPORT 1841.

Weelastic fluid, considerable difficulties present themselves.  do not know

that the difficulties are real ; we think, as Mr. Whewell hints*, that they are

introduced by an arbitrary assumption concerning infinitesimal magnitudes.

One difficulty is as follows : If heat flow from one point or place to another,

the variation of temperature is a quantity of the first order ; whilst if we ob-

tain the variation by estimating the gain and loss of heat which that point or

plane receives, we shall find it to be a quantity of the second order. Biot,

who in 1804 read to the Institute a short memoir on this subject fj was con-

strained to leave his fundamental equation without demonstration on this

account {. The difficulty is supposed to have been removed by Laplace §,
who does indeed present reasoning bearing with some weight on the subject.

But we could have wished that he had distinctly answered the following

question. If three equal, small, contiguous slices of a bar be conceived col-

lected each at its middle plane, will the quantity of heat which in a given time

passes from the first to the second, or from the second to the third, depend

on the (small) thickness of the slices or not ? Fourier doubtless saw that it

would not, and therefore, instead of reasoning on the difference of heat be-

tween two portions of the body directly, he fixes his attention on the Jlow of
--Aheat across a plane. His reasoning is as follows :
                                                       homogeneous body is

supposed to be traversed by two parallel planes whose distance is e, of the

lower of which every point has the same temperature a, and of the upper a

different and less temperature h. Then, if v represent the temperature at

any intermediate point at the distance z from the lower plane, the expression
         --a h
= --V a  '^-- z being supposed to be once established as the law of the

temperature at all points, no change will take place in the state of heat of the

body . To prove this he takes two points at equal distances from the plane
                               II

whose temperature is v, the one above, the other below it, and shows that the

excess of the temperature of the lower above v is exactly equal to the defect

of temperature of the upper from v. He then concludes thus : " It follows

that the quantity of heat transmitted by the lower point to the middle one is

the same as that which the middle one transmits to the upper, for all the

elements loldch concur to determine this quantity of transmitted heat are the

samef^." Thus M. Fourier's hypothesis of conduction is, that theflow of heat

depends on the difference of temperature ; or as he gives it, " the flow of heat
across a given plane, whose distance from some fixed plane is a and tem-

--perature V, is proportional to - " This we regard as the first law of con-

duction.

   No doubt M. Fourier has confounded heat with temperature ; but this

confusion is merely a confusion of terms ; the reasonings and results are un-
affected by it.

   M. Poisson, founding his theory on molecular interchange, and having in
view Dulong and Petit's law of radiation, admits another law of conduction.
This law is thus expressed : " The change of heat between two points depends

on the product of the difference of temperatures of those points, and of a

function of their positions and temperatures **." In M. Poisson's earlier in-

Vestigations the latter factor had been regarded as a function of the positions

of the particles only* ; although he Avas led by analogy to the adoption of the
above law, as he himself informs us f , yet he does not appear to have adopted

the law of Dulong and Petit itself as the law of conduction. He leaves it

indeterminate, having found, as we shall show in another part of our report,

difficulties in admitting such to be the case.

   Lastly, the author of the present report, in a short memoir which he read

to the Royal Society of Edinburgh %, suggested the possibility of the ex-
istence of a third law of conduction, differing considerably from either of the
former as they are actually adopted, but which might be made to differ

little from Poisson's by the change of a few of the quantities to which that

author has assigned values. The law may be stated briefly as follows :
" The flow of a function of thermometric temperature across a given plane

varies as the difference of the values of this function on the two sides of the

plane." It will be seen at once that this law restores us all Fourier's con-

clusions, provided we regard his phrase " heat " or " temperature," Avhich

he uses indifferently, as signifying a given function of thermometric tempera-
ture. These are the only laws of conduction which have been suggested :

they are mere hypotheses. In seeking for a law of radiation we may have

recourse to direct experiment, but here no such means are in our power.

All that we can do is to experiment on the combined effects of radiation and

conduction ; and then, supposing ourselves in possession of the effects due
to the former, to eliminate them, and infer the law of conduction from the
remainder. But this cannot be done without computation, and computation
cannot be effected without formulae, which latter must be based on the hypo-

thesis of conduction itself. Thus we are reduced to the indirect method of

assuming the law, and testing by experiment the conclusions which spring

Wefrom the assumption.  must prepare, therefore, to examine the results

of analytical investigation applied to certain laws of radiation and conduc-

tion which are at first conceived to be true, but only to be finally esta-

blished by the conclusions themselves. Before we proceed, it will, perhaps,

be as well to repeat that we have found two laws of radiation and three of
conduction to exist as the assumed laws of nature. By the combinations of
these laws we could conceive six different theories of heat to arise. Of these

two would be obviously at variance with our present notions of fact ; the

other four have to be examined.

   All the earlier theorists assumed, as we have already stated, the most

simple axioms of radiation and conduction, viz. that the flow of temperature

is proportional to the excess of temperature. Such being the case, we may

venture to pass over the labours of Biot, Laplace, and others, not because
they are unimportant, but because the same results are to be found in the

more extensive and systematic writings of Fourier. In 1807 this philosopher
read before the Institute a memoir, in which the subject was treated in a
masterly manner, and the difficulties which had previously encompassed it

were removed §. The Academy of Sciences, with the laudable design of

inducing the author to prosecute his researches, proposed as the subject of

the Prize Essay to be awarded in 1812, " To give the Mathematical Laws
of Radiation and Conduction, and to establish them by experiment." Ac-
cordingly, on Sept. 28, 1811, M. Fourier's second memoir was deposited^in the
archives of the Institute. The prize was decided to have been gained by it,

but not without an expression of the restrictions which the Academy put on
its favourable opinion. The committee appointed to examine and report on

the memoir, consisting of Laplace, Lagrange and Legendre, whilst they
agreed in proclaiming the novelty and importance of the subject, and in de-

claring that the equations are the true equations required by the conditions,
expressed a difficulty about the way in which they had been deduced, and

added, that the means employed to effect their integration left much to be
desired. Fourier never yielded to this judgment ; and accordingly he printed
his memoir exactly as it was written in the memoirs of the Academy for
1 825 and 1 826 : nor did he ever modify or extend his views, so far as we know.

He published his Treatise on Heat in 1822, which does not essentially differ

from his memoir.

It is not necessary to trace all the circumstances which withheld from the

Weworld these important investigations for so many years.  must not lay

all the blame on the Institute ; doubtless a part of it falls on Fourier himself.

The accounts which had appeared were scanty. They will be found in the

'Annales de Chimie,' iii. 250 (1816), iv. 128 (1817), vi. 259 (1817) ; ' Bulletin
des Sciences de la Societe Philomatique', 1818, p. 1, and 1820, p. 60 ; the
'Analyse des Trauvaux de 1'Academic,' 1820, Scc.hy Delambre.

   Whilst the memoir lay in the archives of the Institute, the labours of
Dulong and Petit had, by the establishment of another law, rendered it de-

sirable that the theorist should reconstruct his equations and extend his ana-

Welysis.  can understand well enough why M. Fourier did not attempt

this. Whilst his own investigations lay unknown, he had no inducement to

extend or continue them : far less was he likely to take in hand a totally new

investigation which could hardly be expected to present results so beautiful

and symmetrical, and must, from their further approach to a correspondency

with the laws of nature, have withdrawn attention from his previous labours.

But we are astonished that M. Poisson, who laboured successfully in this as

in every other field of mathematical physics, did not see the necessity of

adopting axioms conformable to fact. We suspect that he and Lame, and

all the other writers who treated of the subject, were more anxious to pursue

a line of investigation which led to symmetric formulae, than one which

should lead to results conformable with the facts of experiment.

   The person who first attempted an investigation based on principles more
approaching to the probable law of nature was M. Libri. His memoir was
read to the Academy of Sciences in 1825, and is printed in the 'Memoires de
Mathematique et de Physique ' *, and in ' Crelle's Journal ' for 1831, vii. 1 16.

   The grounds of his investigations are, 1. That extra-radiation follows the
law of Dulong and Petit. 2. That conduction follows the law of Biot, La-

place and Fourier. He confines himself to the solution of one problem, as

the most simple that could be selected to illustrate his views. The problem

is the determination of the temperature of a ring heated 'at one point. The

author integrates the equation for the variable state of heat on the hypo-
thesis that the variation from the ordinary results which is introduced by
taking Dulong and Petit's law is a small quantity. Certain peculiarities in

his process of integration have drawn the attention of those who are inter-
ested in the subject to this memoir. The author of the present report was
the first to find fault with M. Libri's solution in 1837 f. Others have, since
that time, joined in the opinion ; amongst the rest M. Liouville. The paper of
this author, read to the Institute, and published in his 'Journal des Mathema-
tiques ' for 1838, has caused some little discussion on the subject, which the
reader will find in the ' Comptes Rendus ' for 1838, 39 and 40.

We should not have thought it necessary to mention this subject were we

not desirous of seeing the attention of philosophers directed to this branch

of physics. It is extraordinary, that a theory, professing to be a physical

theory based on experiment, should have been suffered to lie for twelve years

hardly known in fact, but occasionally alluded to as complete and satisfac-

toi'y. In the kindred science of optics half the time would have sufficed to

attract the attention of the whole scientific world ; and experiment and analy-

Wetical investigation would have been lavished on the subject.      hope M.

Libri will be induced to pursue his investigations^ further, and to reduce the

results to a tangible form.

   The next theory to be mentioned is that of Poisson. In his ' Theorie Ma-
thematique de la Chaleur' (1835), he adopts the law established by Dulong
and Petit for extra-radiation, and conceives that a similar law may apply to

the interior transmission of heat. The hypothesis on which he proceeds re-

lative to the changes of heat between all parts, the complication of his re-

sults, and a degree of uncertainty which hangs over the law of change,

render his work rather a display of analytical artifice than an attempt to

build up a theory by applying to it the test of an examination by contrast

with the facts it is designed to account for. It is to be regretted that M.

Poisson, in turning his attention to the fundamental difficulties in the theory,

did not adopt the plan of endeavouring, in the first place, to remove them,

and afterwards to advance to the application of the same principles to the

more difficult and complex questions which might present themselves. As
it is, we can find in his work only one conclusion to which we can turn, in

the present state of our knowledge, with the view of applying to it the test

of experimental examination : this result we shall exhibit in its proper

Weplace.  have only to add, that M. Poisson's equation has been deduced

by Mr. Rankine in the ' Edinburgh Academic Annual,' and applied to the de-

termination of the temperature of a heated globe.

Lastly, the author of the present report has suggested that it is proper to

try a fourth theory, the last which the combinations of the laws of radiation

and conduction admit of. It does not appear improbable, that although the

flow of temperature does not depend on the dift'erence of temperature, the

flow of heat should depend on the difference of heat, provided we regard

heat as a certain state of the body different from temperature. This theory

then rests on the hypotheses, 1 . That the variation of v due to cooling in

vacuo depends directly on v, 2. That the flow of v across a given plane

varies as the difference of the values of v on the two sides of that plane.

Thus this theory coincides altogether with Fourier's, except that v is no

longer the temperature, but a certain function of the temperature. The

                  (1 ~ ) + B*, where 6 is the temperature
= A --afunction appears to be z;

and a is Dulong and Petit's constant.

These are the four theories which at present exist, each based on the com-

bination of one of the two axioms of radiation with one of the three axioms

Weof conduction.  propose now to write down some of the most import-

ant and simple of the conclusions to which they respectively lead.

I. Fourier's hypotliesis. That the flow of temperature depends directly on

the difference of temperature, both within and at the surface of a body.

As we have already stated that one of the formulae had been given by Biot

prior to the appearance of Fourier's memoir, it will save confusion, if, not-

withstanding, we make our references to Fourier's work alone.

   5. As the time increases, the law of temperatures in a ring tends to become
such that the sum of the temperatures at the opposite extremities of a dia-
meter is equal to 2 « ~ ' ; which shows that the sum is the same at the ex-
tremities of whatever diameter we estimate them. (Art. 245.)

   II. Libri's hypothesis. That the interior conduction follows Newton's, and
the extra- radiation Dulong and Petit's law. The author has only applied
his analysis to the motion of heat in a ring. The conclusion to which he

arrives is the following

   6. If a ring be heated at one point and then left to cool, the sum of the

temperatures at a given instant at the two extremities of a diameter is the

same for every diameter that may be taken.

    This result, which is only approximate, is not adapted for testing the truth

of the theory. It is, however, quite independent of any considerations re-

specting the mode by which the equations may be integrated.
   The author of the present report has applied Libri's hypothesis and method

to the solution of the same problem. He finds that

more rapidly than it would if Newton's law were true. Nothing else is

altered. (Theory of Heat, p. 75.)

   This result, it must be confessed, is deduced from the omission of many

terms in the equation in order to effect an approximation. It can hardly be

regarded as a tolerable expression of fact.

   III. M. Poissons hypothesis. That extra-radiation follows Dulong and

--Petit's law, whilst conduction follows an analogous law, the flow of tempe-

rature depending on the product of the variation of temperature, and a

function of the temperature. In M. Poisson's large work will be found the

solution of a considerable number of the resulting equations ; but the solu-

tion is in general approximate, and effected in such a manner as to reduce

Wethe hypothesis actually to M. Fourier's hypothesis.  find very few prac-

ticable results in the work, derived from the proper axioms on which it pro-

fesses to be founded. One only can be given which will serve the purpose

we have in view. The equation which gives the permanent state of heat in

                            ( ^ -j  I

where k and p are functions of the temperature, such that k j-- and p v

respectively represent the flow of heat in a small time (considered as unity)

within and on the surface of the body ; <^ is the temperature of the surround-

ing vacuum.

  --M. Poisson assumes that u i^ or v is small, or perhaps rather (as appears

pto us) that certain multipliers of this quantity are small, so that k and

may be expanded in terms of v, and high powers of this quantity may be
omitted. He thence deduces the following equation as expressing the per-

manent temperature of a bar heated at one extremity ; the length of the bar

being indefinitely great :

»=8. 1          -(y -2 m) 0e~^*' H - (y  2 m) e        ~^^ "^                           where y

= mlog^ 1-0077, and is undetermined, but depends on the manner in which

the conductivity varies with the temperature. (Theorie de la Chaleur, Art.

105.)

   On this result we must make some remarks. In the first place, we con-

ceive that by a slip of the pen M. Poisson has given a wrong value to y

mit appears to be properly --- log 1*0077. The quantities y and                         result

                            2e

++from the expansion ofp and k in the form p p y u, k k m u. In the next
mplace, we find some difficulty in understanding what the quantity actually is

supposed to be. If M. Poisson conceives, as he leads us to believe in his pre-

face (p~. 6), that Dulong and Petit's law is applicable to the interior as well

mas to the exterior flow of heat, we cannot see how he regards as undeter-

Wemined.  should have thought, that if it be admissible to expand in terms

mof V at all, must have been known. Perhaps M. Poisson saw a difficulty
-- min admitting this, arising from the circumstance that y 2 might (and it

appears to us it would) turn out to be negative, and thus disprove the whole

theory. The phrase which M. Poisson makes use of is this : Quant a la con-

stante m, elle depend de la maniere dont la conducibilite varie avec la tempe-

rature ; et sa valeur n'est pas non plus connue. (p. 255.)
   IV. The theory suggested by the author of this report adopts all the re-

sults of the hypothesis of Fourier. In this case v will not express the fem-

perature as measured by an air-thermometer, but a certain function of that

To the collection of formulae which we have extracted from the writings of

Fourier, Poisson, and Libri, we may add the following, which apply to ex-

periments of the simplest kind.

   9. On Libri's hypothesis, the permanent state of temperature in a small

uniform bar of indefinite length heated at one end is represented (approxi-

mately) by the equation

                      v--Ke ^                A- log^ a    _9,,r

10. On Fourier's hypothesis, the temperature at the extremity of a like bar,

where u is the temperature of the heated extremity, and C is a constant, not

depending on u.

   11. Cor. The temperature at any point of a bar of finite length is repre-
sented by

   The expression shows that the temperature is the difference of two quan-
tities ; the one due to the heating at the one extremity, and the other follow-
ing a corresponding law, and due to the cooling at the other extremity of the

bar.

   12. On Libri's hypothesis, the expression for the temperature at the extre-

mity of a bar heated permanently at the other extremity is

                                                                                                 "o

q , are constants. This proposition is of some importance, but from the
want of experiments we do not think it necessary to exhibit the values of the

constants in full.

   The demonstration is as follows : since

15. When a bar, so large as that it may be considered infinite, is heated

at one end to the constant temperature a, and kept at the other to the con-

stant temperature b, as assumed in formula 1 , the state of temperature at any

point, as deduced from M. Poisson's theory, is given by the equation

    ^_a+'-^(v"--a"-) + (a-b+'^ o^^^^) - = 0.
                     2 2e

The proof of this proposition is as follows

Since the bar is very large, the effect of radiation is zero (at least near the

centre of the bar). Therefore the equation of motion is -7-- · I -r^ )^^^'

           =j,dv   c.

        or « -7--
        az

   Now Poisson's approximates by supposing k' =.k -\- kmti.

Hence the equation is immediately integrable, and the result is as above

given.

the a which is affected with an index being Dulong and Petit's a.

  We have not thought it relevant to our present subject to point out the

difference which exists between hypotheses III. and IV.; as, however, we have

given only approximate formulae corresponding with the former hypothesis,

it may be proper to mention, that, for expressions not involving the time, the

essential difference between the formulae will be seen by the difference of
sign of the quantity which corresponds with m. It will be seen that on hy-

the approximate form on hypothesis IV. is

We k=may add, that if we assume    aa^, the correct equation for hypothesis

When the time enters into the expression, no analogy exists between the

formulae, deduced on the two hypotheses.
   If we were in possession of a number of experiments adapted for the purpose,

it would be desirable that the constants in formula (12) and (13) were more

fully expressed. When such experiments shall have been made, a very little

trouble will suffice to effect this. Should it appear, moreover, that experi-

ments bearing on formulae different from that which we have given can be
more easily performed, the corresponding expressions may be readily deduced

from the equations given above.

We WeII. proceed now to the second division of our report.       have to

inquire to what extent theory has been tested by experiment. In prosecuting

this inquiry we shall be led to examine for ourselves such of the formulae as

Weappear to be parallel to the experiments we possess.  hope by so doing

to point out the facility with which experiment is made available, as well as

practically to exhibit the neglect or want of attention which this department

of science has suffered.

  We turn first to the experiments described in M. Biot's ' Traite de Phy-

sique' (1816), tom. iv. Those which follow were made with the design of
testing the formula for the permanent state of heat at any point of a very

long bar heated at one end. The author himself compares them with the

formula, which, as we have said before, was discovered by him, but never

completely demonstrated.

   (1 .) The first experiment was made with a bar of iron, plunged at one extre-
mity into a bowl of mercury at 102§° cent. : along the bar were ranged eight
thermometers at various distances from each other. The observations were

made after the state of the temperature, as indicated by the thermometers,

had arrived at permanency ; and the length of the bar was so great that the
temperature of its free extremity did not sensibly differ from that of the air.

The following table contains the i-esults of this experiment reduced to the
centigrade scale. The distances are expressed in decimetres, and the num-

bers in the third column express the permanent state of the excess of tem-

perature of the corresponding points of the bar above that of the surrounding

air. This latter temperature was 1 6^°.

                                                                                                       80-855.

III. On M. Poisson's hypothesis we have formula 8, viz.

       y y« = |l - (y - 2»0 }0e-^'' + (y-2m)e 2^*':

where d is the temperature at the heated extremity of the bar, and y, as cor-

rected above, is -OOSSIS. To compare this formula with experiment, we have

supposed that g has the same value as we found it to have according to the

preceding hypothesis. This supposition cannot, to any considerable extent,

Weaffect the results ; and we could not obtain g by any other direct means.

IV. Lastly, on the hypothesis that the flow of v is proportional to v, both

Wewithin and at the surface of the medium.                                                                      reduce v to thermometric

12accurate except for the air thermometer ; and we determine the constants

from thermometers 3 and 5. Tlie following are the results
                                34                                                                              5 67

It may be proper to remark, that although we have adopted MM. Dulong

and Petit's value of a, we are aware that for radiation in air, so far as the

formula approximates to the circumstances, this value of a is too small.

(2.) The next experiment given by M. Biot (p. 673) is the following

A bar of iron was held for many hours plunged in melting lead. The ves-

sel containing the lead was heated from below by means of a lamp and cur-

rent of air. To prevent the temperature from increasing, a small bar of
                        ON THE CONPUCTION OP HEAT.                          17

unmelted lead was kept constantly in the vessel. The temperature of the air
was kept uniformly at 18° '125. The unit of length was taken as the distance
between the first and second thermometers. The following table contains

the results :

I. The result of calculation on the first hypothesis, the errors being ar-

ranged so that there shall be the smallest possible total error amongst the

first four thermometers, is given by M. Biot as follows

1                23                         45                     67

II. On the second hypothesis the values of the constants are

               = = --A 206-9 and log e~^            -20955,

as determined from the first and third thermometers. The table is as follows

  -- =III. By the third hypothesis, retaining the value of ^ given by the second,

we get y 2 »t -003206, a result probably too great ; and there arises the

following table

        1 2 3 4 5 67

   76-875        47-76     29-375           18-23   11-45    4-6      1-85
12IV. The computations on the fourth hypothesis give
                                         3 45                6          7

By selecting other observations to determine the constants, we might, had

it been requisite, have made the results more conformable in this case.
   (3.) M. Biot's third experiment was made on a bar of copper, plunged at one

extremity into melting lead. It carried fourteen thermometers, of which,

however, eleven only were available. The unit of distance was 101 milli-

metres, and the temperature of the surrounding air 15-75°. The following

table exhibits the result

The next series of experiments similar to the above we obtain from the

work of M. Despretz, entitled ' Traite de Physique.' The author read be-

fore the Academy of Sciences in 1821 a memoir, the object of which is to

measure in a number of substances the conductive power relative to heat. It

is published in the ' Memoires des S^avans Etrangers.' An account of it ap-

pears in the ' Annales de Chimie,' t. xix. (1821) p. 97, by M. Fourier, and it

Weis extracted in works referred to above (1825).            have added the exa-

Wemination of the four formulae by means of these experiments.            shall find

that they all come very wide of the results, even in cases differing in no ap-

parent particular from those given by M. Biot. This is remarkable, for all

the formulas agree well with M. Biot's experiments. To what circumstance

can we attribute this fact ? It cannot be supposed that the presence of the

air should vitiate one series of experiments without affecting the other, in

Wewhich everything else is similar.      can only suggest, that the bars whose

conducting powers were examined, were not sufficiently long to be regarded

as infinite. Unfortunately M. Despretz does not mention their length. The

experiments were as follows

(4.) The stationary excesses of temperature above that of the air, at dif-

12ferent points of a bar of copper taken at equal distances from each other,
were found to be as follows : .

The temperature of the air was 17-08°, and the distance between tAVO con-

secutive thermometers ten centimetres.

The following are the calculated results, by the four hypotheses respect-

ively, using in each case the results of the first and third thermometers for

the determination of the constants.

Of the other formulae which have been tested by experiment we do not

make much account, since it is our impression that the experiments were con-

ducted rather with a view to illustrate the formulae than to try the validity

Weof the principles on which they depend.   instance the following : it is

taken from Fourier's Memoir, which contains several others, ' Mem. de I'ln-

stitut/ tom. V. p. 217. See also Kelland, 'Theory of Heat,' p. 60.

Three thermometers were placed at different points of a solid ring, at in-

tervals of one-eighth of the circumference : a fourth was so placed that the

third lay midway between it and the first. The temperatures observed were

+66°, 50^2°, 4^*°, and 34-353° 17f°, respectively.

--The equation which results from formula (3) is        = I--            --) 2,

where v^, v^... are the excesses of temperature of the different thermometers

above that of the air.

   By computation, it appears that the first side of this equation is 3-140, and

the second 3-143, a difference hardly appreciable.

   The second and third hypotheses give formulse which are merely correc-

tions on the first. In this case, therefore, no correction is required.

In computing the result on the fourth hypothesis, our equation is

f Xl-a~^'+ 1 -a~^' ^ ( l1 -ga--~^'' + l1 -aa---^a' y_^^
-1 a-^'                      V )-1 a-'-^

and the first side is equal to 2-96, the second to 2-875 ; a coincidence which,

though not so close as the former, is very far within the error due to the

Weeffect of the air.  are almost inclined to believe that the veiy closeness

of the coincidence by the former process proves the incorrectness of the for-

mula to represent what it is intended to express.

  We are now, in the last place, to exhibit the results of an experiment of a

different kind, and one which, had it been well made, we should have deemed

most important. It is taken from M. Biot's work, 'Traite de Physique,' iv.676.
               ON THE CONDUCTION OF HEAT.                           21

  A(10.) rod composed of a mixture of tin and bismuth in equal portions,

which melts at the temperature of boiling water, was plunged at one extre-

mity into a basin of mercurj'. The mercury was kept successively for a long
time at different constant temperatures, by means of a lamp placed below it.

A thermometer was adjusted to the other extremity of the rod, in a little cap-

sule filled with mercury. Observations of the temperature indicated by this

thermometer, corresponding Avith each stated temperature of the mercury in

the basin, were made, when the state had become stationary. Tlie following
table exhibits the corresponding excesses of temperature of the mercury and
of the thermometer above that of the air. The latter was 20°.

Before we compare this table with theory, it is right that we express our

Webelief that there has been some mistake in the obsei-vations.     think this

will be made out when it is seen that the following is the order of elevations

of the upper thermometer, due to elevations of temperature of the heated end.

               For the first 10°-25 the thermometer rose 3°;

                    For the second 9°-5 the thermometer rose 2°-5 ;
                    For the third 9°"5 the thermometer rose 2°-5

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

in which the rise of the thermometer is nearly, but not quite, proportionate

to that of the mercury ; but

       For the fourth 19°-5 the thermometer rose only 2°-5.

WeThis we think very unlikely.  should expect to find the proportion of the

increase of temperature of the thermometer to that of the mercury continually

diminish as the absolute temperature increases. The following are, however,

the ratios as given by the above table

hasten, then, to the third part of our Report.             propose very

briefly to reflect on the consequences deducible from the computations we

have entered into ; and to conclude by adding a few remarks tending to sug-

gest the proper mode of conducting experiments which shall serve a better

Wepurpose in eflecting the object of establishing theory.  may observe then,

1st, that experiments on the permanent state of temperature at different points

of a long bar of a good conducting substance, and which radiates into air,

are utterly valueless in this matter. To prove this, we will write down the

difference between the calculated and observed values of the temperature for

a few cases.

Weutterly unable to draw any conclusion from these experiments.  shall

experience the same difficulty if we proceed to examine the other results in

the same way. If we confined our attention to experiments (1.), (2.) and

(3.), we might conclude that all the formulae are correct ; if to (8.) and (9.),
we should certainly conclude that all are incorrect. Nor is it easy to say

which is the best from the former test, or which is the worst from the latter.

Seeing, then, that agreement with experiment is no test of truth, it is not too
Wemuch to argue that disagreement is no test of error.
                                                        must eliminate the

efiect of the air, or be provided with experiments in vacuo, before we can
form our conclusions, unless we can be furnished with experiments of a much

more searching character than these.

2. It is hardly necessaiy to call attention to the insufficiency of the class

of experiments which was made by M. Fourier, and of which we have exhi-

bited one specimen. The results for the ring, it is true, are not so obvious
that they might be deduced from popular reasoning, and we must give M.

Fourier great crpdit for selecting these results in order to show the agree-

ment of his theory with experiment ; but as we are now in want of a means

of disproving rather tlian of establishing theories, we must look, for results of

Wea totally dift'erent character.  shall point out where such are to be found

by and by.

  We3. think we may consider that experiment (10.) shows the inaccuracy

of the first formula ; it fails, however, to give any preference to one of the

other three. The table of errors is as follows

will lead to what we seek. They were not originally conducted with refer-

ence to the state of things assumed to exist in theory, and are, in conse-
quence, of less value when allowance is made for the difference between what

they express and what theory requires. Now we do not deny that difficulties

do attend the experimental examination of this subject, when it is intended

to make everything correspond with the state supposed in theory. The

chief and greatest of these we conceive to arise from the presence of the air.

MM. Dulong and Petit have shown that the quantity of beat carried off by

the air is not only very large, but is governed by a law very different from

that of ordinary radiation. Means have therefore to be devised for removing

this cause of error ; but we are far from thinking that the difficulty of effect-

MM.ing this amounts to an impossibility. If  Dulong and Petit could suc-

ceed in determining the rates of cooling of a body hi vacuo, we cannot see
why others should not succeed in observing the stationary temperature at one

point, at least, of a body which radiates in vacuo. This leads us to the sug-

Wegestions with which we shall conclude the present Report.  shall offer

two: 1st, as to the most important experiments; 2ndly, as to the mode by
which they may be conducted.

    It is perhaps chargeable against the theoretical writers on this branch of

physics, and especially against M. Poisson, that they have not presented their

results in a form sufficiently tangible to direct or suggest the application of

experiment to them. It is much to be regretted that no attempt has been
made to obviate this. With the view of remedying the state of things to a
certain extent, we have exhibited in their most simple forms some of the
more obvious conclusions to which the different theories lead. No doubt
much might be done in this way, but, until called for by the entry of expe-

rimenters on the field, a large and varied collection of formulae would serve

no useful purpose. One class of experiments alone appears amply to suffice

for our present purpose. The object being, to discover a law of conduction,
it will be best attained by the selection of circumstances in which radiation

either plays no part at all, or in which its effect is very simple and readily

eliminated. The former condition exists in the problem which is solved by
formulas 1, 15 and 16. By selecting a substance of small conducting power,

such as marble, and coating the block with a substance which will radiate

very slowly, this experiment may be made on a block of no very great di-
mensions. For many reasons this experiment is well worth trying. It will

probably distinguish at once between the three theories. It will certainly

offer strong reasons for rejecting either the third or the fourth. Of course

it will hardly serve to establish directly either of them. To effect this, we

would point out another most important experiment, The determination of
tlie state of temperature at one extremity of a bar wJiich is heated at the other
extremity. This experiment should be made on a variety of bars, of different

conducting powers and of different lengths. With a set of careful experi-
ments of this nature, we believe we could pronounce, without fear, the true
law of conduction. Nor do we tliink the difficulties attendant on the con-

duct of the experiments to be at all insuperable. The greatest obstacle is,
no doubt, the expense of apparatus ; but where we find expense overruled in
the prosecution of experimental researches into less important and certainly
not more interesting branches of physics, Avhere theory has hardly opened a

field for speculation, and where curiosity alone prompts the inquiry, it mus't
excite our surprise that so little has been done in this case, which presents

analytical developments of great beauty, and, independently of its close con-

nexion with the favourite theories of light and the discoveries of chemistry,

deserves to rank high amongst the physico-mathematical sciences. But,
               ON THE CONDUCTION OF HEAT.                     25

leaving expense out of the question, the real practical obstacle is the presence

Weof the air.  have seen that the law of cooling into air is different from

that of radiation. Even supposing, therefore, -we were in possession of the

correct statement of that law, such would be the difficulty of obtaining for-

mulae from it, that to attempt to eliminate its effect, together with that of
radiation, is almost hopeless. If it can be done at all, it must be by means

of experiments carried on in air of different elasticities. It has been proved

MM.by Dulong and Petit, that " the velocity of cooling of a body due to

the sole contact in a gas, depends, for the same excess of temperature, on the

density and temperature of the gas ; but this dependence is such that the

velocity of cooling remains the same if the density and the temperature of

the gas change in such a way that the elasticity remains constant." The

effect, then, of the presence of the air is to introduce a term which involves

a power of the elasticity as one factor, and a function of the excess of tem-

perature as another. The latter function may be determined (perhaps) by

means of a number of experiments made at different elasticities. But we

should greatly prefer a set of experiments on radiation in vacuo. It appears

to us, that the difficulty in this case is very much the same as that against

which MM. Dulong and Petit had to contend in investigating the kindred

law of radiation ; and we should conceive that a similar contrivance to that
which they used might be adopted to overcome it. All that we require is,

that a certain portion of a bar heated at one extremity, radiate in vacuo, and

that the temperature at two of its points, the other extremity being one, be

MM.capable of constant observation.  Dulong and Petit made use of a cop-

per balloon which could be exhausted of air, and by means of ice be kept

constantly to the freezing temperature, notwithstanding the radiation of the

Aheat from the body within it.  somewhat similar contrivance we conceive

would serve for the conduct of the experiment before us. The bar of metal

to be experimented on migiit pass through the balloon and be heated in air,

whilst the assumed point of heating might be marked by a thermometer in-

Weserted into a hole in the bar just within the balloon.  wish M. Biot had

marked his lowest point, not at the surface of the heated mercury, but at a

point a little above it ; it would have insured greater steadiness in the re-

sults. Should any one think of undertaking this experiment, we would

recommend that he extend his observations over a wider range of tempera-

tures than M. Biot has done. The thermometer which represents the heated

end of the bar should stand permanently at every 5°, from 0° to as high as

can be accomplished. It must be borne in mind, that two at least of the ob-

servations are requisite for the determination of the constants, except in the

case of formula li. The observations should likewise embrace a succession

of bars of different substances, iron, brass, lead, etc., all of the same dimen-

sions. Different series of observations should be made, in which the dimen-

sions of the bars have different constant magnitudes, and others in which they

have different lengths. All the substances might be coated with the same

varnish, so as to render their radiating powers the same. With such experi-

ments, we have no doubt that the law of conduction, although not like the

law of radiation, an inference from direct observation, might be readily esta-

blished, and the science of heat placed on the same footing with the other

Wemathematical sciences.     hope that the Association, in making known the

wants of this branch of philosophy, will induce some of the numerous distin-

guished experimental philosophers whose names appear on their list, to take

an interest in this matter.                               ,,  K,^elland.

the disturbed performance of the vital actions, many difficulties jjresent them-

selves ; opposite causes occasion one common and similar result, and the

same agent will produce very different effects under circumstances apparently

analogous. Whilst, however, there may be thus many conflicting processes

exhibited to us, we are satisfied that there are leading principles and general

Welaws in operation which it is our great aim to seek for and discover.

cannot avoid allowing the proposition, " That under actually corresponding

circumstances similar effects must ensue." Should then differences exist in

the effects of any substance upon the system, as a poison for example, we

naturally refer them to modifying influences ; at the same time that we explain

the production of similar effects from opposite causes, by the agency of funda-

mental principles, proving simplicity in the laws which regulate our frames.

   The object of my former communications has been to illustrate the effects

of those poisons which induce an alteration in the vascularity of the different

tissues with which they may come in contact, and to portray the appear-

ances exhibited by dissection : on the present occasion some views will be

stated concerning the operation of an agent which is constantly eliminated

from the system, the effects of which, although not indicated by obvious local

changes or capable of elucidation by drawings, appear nevertheless to be

highly deserving of consideration and study. Carbonic acid is the agent

alluded to ; one highly interesting, first, from its producing very marked and

injurious consequences if applied in any way to the human body, either in-

ternally or externally ; secondly, from its immediate connection with one

highly important function of our system ; thirdly, from the analogy of its
effects with some most serious maladies ; and fourthly, from the causes which

influence its secretion.

It cannot here be requisite to insist upon the necessity for the rejection of

all effete matter from the body, or to show the importance of the changes per-

petually going on in the circulating fluids. These points will readily be con-

ceded to me ; nor will the mischief be questioned arising from the presence

of certain principles in the blood, such as bile or urea ; but, while these sub-

stances have deservedly occupied much attention of late, we are neglectful of

an agent far more injurious. The ducts of the liver may be partially, if not

entirely closed, for months ; the kidneys may be removed, or the secretion of
urine may be suspended for more than a week, yet life during that time may

be preserved ; but should the elimination of carbonic acid from the lungs be

prevented for a few minutes, nay, only for a few seconds, life will be placed

in imminent peril, if not irrevocably destroyed.

  We are well aware that carbonic acid is generated by various processes,

for example, by decomposition, both of animal and vegetable bodies, by com-

Webustion, by fermentation, as well as by the respiratory apparatus.  are

also aware that plants yield it by night ; that it is exhaled from tlie earth in

certain situations, and that it is disengaged by chemical action, from com-

Wepounds of which it forms an ingredient.  are certainly ready to admit

that air charged with this gas, from whatever source it may be produced, is

positively and highly detrimental. Sir Humphry Davy deemed it not beneath

his notice to investigate the condition of the atmosphere rendered impure

by persons crowding together in large or public assemblies, and showed that

carbonic acid was present in excess in the vitiated air of such meetings. The

experiments of MM. Allen and Pepys, Lavoisier and Seguin, Davy and Ber-

zelius, concerning the exact quantity of this gas evolved during respiration, still
occupy the attention of the scientific world ; but its effects upon the system

seem to me to be yet greatly overlooked and disregarded. The injurious
consequences which it produces to those who, by accident or design, may be

exposed to its effects, have led to less useful results, practically, than might
have been anticipated from the nature of the symptoms, and the interesting
phenomena which result from its action. Year after year numbers flock to
witness the experiment of submitting a wretched animal to the deadly atmo-
sphere of the " Grotto del Cane," without drawing those deductions, or de-

riving that advantage from its sufferings, which alone can palliate or justify

their infliction.

   Carbonic acid has many sources out of the body, and it is abundantly fur-
nished by respiration. The lungs, however, are by no means its only outlet

from the animal body. It is given off' by the skin, it is secreted as well by

the serous as mucous membranes*, points of much interest, not only as afford-

ing an example of vicarious action, but as explanatory of various bodily dis-
orders. It cannot here be necessary to controvert old errors respecting the
source of the carbonic acid yielded by respiration, nor to dwell upon the

more probable views of modern times. The opinions and experiments of
Mr. Edwards, which prove that this acid is extricated from the lungs, although
no oxygen is respiredf , the observations of Professor Magnus, and his con-

clusions that all blood contains carbonic acid, the belief of Miiller that the
quantity held in solution in itij^ is sufficiently large to account for the whole

exhaled by the lungs, are facts well known to all whom it is my pleasure to

address. Thus we find that a most important series of changes takes place

during the circulation of the blood leading to the formation of carbonic acid,
which is set free from various surfaces, chiefly, however, from the parietes of

the air-cells, which allow it to pass through them in order to be exhaled§.
Next we find that many circumstances greatly influence the amount of this
gas yielded by respiration ; these may be ranked in two classes, one of which
may be considered as natural or regular, the other as accidental or abnor-
mal. With regard to the first of these, to the regular performance of the
functions of the system, we find that more carbonic acid is eliminated during
the day than by night ; that it increases at day-break, and diminishes at sun-
set ; that it is produced in larger quantity by exercise and during digestion ;

                      II

and, what is extremely interesting, we see a tendency to equilibrium in the

whole amount ; for if given off in excess at one time, at another it wiU, as a
consequence, be lessened. With regard to the second class of circumstances
which influence the secretion, we find that it is diminished by depressing
passions, debilitating causes, low diet, and injuries to the par vagumf

   If we now look to the actual effects of carbonic acid, when placed in con-
tact with the living body, many interesting consequences result which serve
to indicate its use in the human economy, and its agency in disease.

   It imparts an acid taste, produces a sense of burning in the uvula**, and acts
instantaneously as a powerful irritant to the muscles of the larynx, occasion-
ing by their spasmodic action the complete and firm closure of the glottisff.
Applied externally to the skin, or taken into the stomach, it occasions giddi-

ness, pain and weight in the head, obscurity of sight, and ringing in the earstJ.

Inhaled bj' tlie breath, it is well known to produce serious and alarming
symptoms, varying as the gas may be more or less diluted. The following
experiments show its effects when injected into the vessels.

--Experiment I. To shotv the Effect of Carbonic Acid injected into the Veins.

   Two fluid ounces (by measure) of this gas, prepared by the action of di-

luted hydrochloric acid upon chalk, were collected over water, and thrown
slowly, by a syringe, into the external saphsena vein of a strong dog. Almost
immediately afterwards the animal exhibited signs of uneasiness, uttered
cries of distress, became convulsed, lost its consciousness, and appeared to be
dying ; it felt, however, the stimulus of cold water when thrown upon it, and
quickly recovered upon being removed into the fresh air.

   It thus is capable of producing a powerful impression on the system, when
thrown into the veins even in a small quantity. Still more marked results
ensued when it was introduced into an artery, as was shown in the next ex-

periment.

Experiment II. To show the Effects of Carbonic Acid when thrown into

                                               the Carotid Artery.

   The left external carotid artery M^as exposed in the same dog, and a small
tube was introduced into it, a ligature having previously been applied to
prevent hemorrhage: a fluid ounce and a half (by measure) of carbonic acid
was then thrown in. This was done gently, but it was necessary to discon-
tinue the experiment, in consequence of the animal becoming convulsed and
foaming at the mouth. After forty seconds it seemed to recover ; but again
relapsed, lost all consciousness and power of movement, was quite insensible,
and lay as if dead upon the floor. At intervals of a few minutes it was seized

with attacks of violent spasms. This alternation of stupor and convulsions
continued for four hours, when the animal regained its senses, the power of
its limbs, and appeared afterwards to suffer no inconvenience.

   M. Nysten considers that the eff'ects witnessed on throwing carbonic acid

into the vessels arise from the distension of the right side of the heart ; this
seems, however, questionable in the experiment just detailed, as the gas was in-
jected slowly in a direction from the heart, and produced other symptoms
than those described as arising from the simple admixture of air with venous
blood*. This eminent experimentalist certainly errs in considering that
carbonic acid is not itself intrinsically poisonous. It cannot be necessary to
pause in order to refute this idea, but it is worth while to mention the diver-
sity in its effects : some speak of experiencing a lively sensation of pleasure
on respiring it ; others, of the sensation of a gentle heat and perspiration

and Sir Humphry Davy said he could answer, from his own experience,

that no pain precedes the insensibility occasioned by breathing gases un-
fitted for supporting life-j-. In general, however, vertigo, head-ache, accele-
rated pulse, hurried breathing, palpitation of the heart, tendency to sleep,
ending in complete loss of consciousness, with convulsions, mark its effects
during life ; whilst retention of the warmth of the body, flexibility of the
limbs, fluidity and blackness of the blood, characterise after death the bodies
of those poisoned by this gas.

   If we now turn to those diseases, the leading symptoms of which bear resem-
blance to the effects of carbonic acid, we find them to be such as prevent the
proper arterialization of the blood, emphysema of the lungs, diseases of the
heart; or, to be brief, all such as impede respiration, in which cases we find

hebetude of mind, torpor of body, inclination to doze, spasmodic respiratory

                                ON POISONS.                        29

movements, and the tendency to convulsive muscular action. It is not, in

truth, novel to refer these symptoms to the accumulation of carbon in the
system ; but, close as the similarity in many respects undoubtedly is in these

instances, the disorder in which we have the nearest resemblance, and which

seems as if it were its true prototype, is still the Opprobrium Medicorum.

We have in the symptoms produced by carbonic acid, the counterpart of those

exhibited in epilepsy ; no less instantaneous is the attack of this appalling

malady, than are the effects of the sudden closure of the glottis by the irri-

tation of the choke damp, or other exposure to fixed air, by persons descend-

ing into vats, or breathing the gas given off by fermentation. Plunge an

animal into it, or inject it into the veins, and we can at will produce epilepsy

with all its terrific features and depressing consequences.

The curious coincidence of the diminished secretion of this acid from the

lungs, towards evening, when the natural tendency to sleep comes on ; the
increase in its quantity at day-break, when epileptic seizures are most likely

to occur ; the hurried and spasmodic respiration, when it is present in excess,

are valid arguments for the belief that it may be an active agent in exciting

both healthy and disordered functions.

Carbonic acid acts upon the medulla oblongata, for it annihilates volition and

consciousness, which have their seat in this portion of the nervous centres.

The medulla oblongata also, be it observed, is the source of the respiratory

Howmovements *.  these are called into action we are yet in doubt ; that

they may be excited primarily and throughout life by the stimulus of car-

bonic acid, is advanced as a conjecture, which derives abundant support from

the analogy of other excretions.

Minute details would here be out of place, or the quantity of this gas,

capable of producing injurious consequences, and the peculiarities of indivi-

duals rendering them especially liable to its influence, might be entered into.

Suffice it, that extremely minute portions of gaseous bodies, as shown in the

instance of the odour of musk, or the fragrance of flowers, is enough to pro-

duce the most decided effects.

It were tedious to enter into collateral inquiry, or to combat objections

which may be advanced against the ideas thus submitted to the Association.

It is doubtless extraordinary that an acid should be formed in the blood, and

given off, instead of combining withthe alkali of the serum. The insensibi-

lity of animals confined in nitrogen or hydrogen gases, in which the quantity

of carbonic acid nearly equals that by natural respiration, may be otherwise

explained ; new combinations may form ; carburetted hydrogen, for instance,
may be generated, which would itself poison the animal ; and we should not

forget the fact, that the insensibility, occasioned under the circumstances

alluded to, is found to be much more easily dissipated than that which arises

from the prevention of the escape of carbonic acid from the body.

From this we might pass on to various spasmodic disorders, but it were

perhaps premature to say anything further on this head ; only one more point

shall be noticed in connection with this subject, and that is the resemblance

in the effects of narcotic poisons to those arising from carbonic acid. Reflec-

tions upon these facts have led me to think that tliis gas may play an essential

part in the phenomena exhibited by narcotics, a class of substances, the

operation of which is so little understood, but the action of which is ob-

viously upon the functions of the system, rather than upon the vascularity of

its organs. It has long been laid down as a rule, that opium is not to be ex-
hibited when the blood is not i^roperly aerated or decarbonised.

  Many experiments have been made by me to ascertain whether any difference

--so REPORT 1841.

existed in the quantity of carbonic acid given off from the system, when
under the influence of opium. With this view the quantity eliminated before

and after a dose of this drug had been taken, has been repeatedly measured.

The experiments were performed by breathing through a solution of pure

potassa, and by Aveighing the result, as well as extricating the carbonic acid
acquired. It is unnecessary to enumerate the modifications in the apparatus
used, in order completely to separate the watery vapour, to prevent the
chloride of calcium employed for this purpose from descending into the
potassa and negativing the result, to obviate the escape of minute portions
of the solution of potassa on passing the expired air through it ; the conclu-

sion arrived at is, that much more carbonic acid is given oif simultaneously
with the production of the effects of opium. Not only is the number of re-
spirations increased, and thus more is eliminated, but in an equal number of
respirations there was found to be an increase of at least one-tenth. The

quantity of opium. taken was equivalent to a grain and a half of the extract,
and the observation was made as soon as the effects (tightness of the fore-
head, slight sensation of nausea, accelerated pulse, quickened breathing, and
general feehng of tranquillity) were perceived. It were easy to show the gene-
ral likeness of the action of narcotics to those produced by carbonic acid gas

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

but to connect them with this last-named agent will require further inquiry.

   Allow me now, in conclusion, to state that the ideas expressed in this paper,

are submitted with great deference to the Meeting ; that they are advanced
with the view of calling attention to certain interesting but obscure pheno-
mena, and are forwarded in compliance with the desire of the Association.

   15 Welbeck Street, July 1841.

Report on Discussions of Bristol Tides, performed by Mr. Bunt
      under the direction of the Rev. W. Whewell, F.R.S.

[With Plates 2, 3, 4, 5.]

The careful and intelligent manner in v/hich Mr. Bunt had conducted those

Discussions of the Tides, on which the grants of the British Association in

former years had enabled me to employ him, made me very desirous of continu-

ing to profit by his labours, in order to bring, if possible, the ascertained laws

of the tides nearer to the observations. With this view I applied at the last

meeting for an additional grant of 50^. ; and have now to report the pro-

Wegress which has been consequently made in our tide discussions.  began

by considering the possibility of improving the correction for lunar declina-

tion, and the determination of the anterior epoch of the semimenstrual in-

equality. But it did not appear very probable that any additional discus-

sion of the observations which we had before us would give us any additional

accuracy, commensurate with the great labour which must be undergone in

making the trial. I was therefore the more ready to follow out a suggestion

of Mr. Bunt's, who wrote to me in January last that he had recently deter-

mined to try whether he could perceive any effect on the heights of high

water at Bristol produced by atmospheric pressure. He adds, " I accord-

ingly arranged the errors of the calculated heights for 1840 in columns for

every two-tenths of an inch of the barometer, observed contemporaneously

with the tide."

   From a diagram given in his letter, the average effect appeared to be about
15 inches depression of high water to 1 inch rise of mercury in barometer. The

consistency of these results leaves no doubt as to the fact of a sensible effect on

the heights from this cause. In his letter, he adds, " Some subsequent trials
ON DISCUSSIONS OF BRISTOL TIDES.                       81

" gave nearly the same result, only a trifle less in the depression of high water
" for an inch rise of mercury. The specific gravities of mercury and water
" being not far (if I recollect right) from this ratio of 14 or 15 to 1, it would
" seem that the total weight of the compound column of air and water raised
" by the force which produces the tide, remains nearly unaifected by the

" changes of atmospheric pressure. By introducing this new correction, there-

" fore, a very considerable portion of our Residual Error is accounted for."
   The barometric observations which Mr. Bunt used for finding the effects

of atmospheric pressure on the heights of high water at Bristol, were those
contained in the register kept at the Bristol Institution, which extended back
to a period earlier than the commencement of the tide observations.

   As it had appeared that all the other eff"ects of external forces upon the
height and time of high water corresponded not to the forces at the moment

of observation, but to a state of the forces at an anterior period, it occurred

as possible that this might also be the case with the eff'ect of the atmospheric
pressure upon the height of the tide ; and that the correction corresponding
to this effect might be most accurately obtained by taking the state of the
barometer at some period anterior to the time of high water ; for instance,

twelve hours or twenty-four hours. If this were the case, we should be able to
predict the effect of atmospheric pressure upon the tide, a day or half a day
previous to the event. As this prospect gave an additional interest to the
inquiry, I begged Mr. Bunt to try the comparative results of contempora-

neous and anterior epochs of the barometric observation. This he proceeded

to do, by arranging various portions of our observations according to the
heights of the barometer. The following is the account of the result.

                                                                                                "Bristol, Feb. 18, 1841,

" I send you diagrams of the effects of atmospheric pressure on the heights

of high water for every tenth of an inch height of the barometer, from

29'2 or '3 inches to 30*4 or '5 inches, for the years 1834, 35, 39 ; barometer
and tide contemporaneous. Also for the year 1834, barometer heights being
twenty-four hours anterior to high water. Also for 1839, barometer 29*2,

·3, '4, '5 inches to 30'2, '3, "45 inches, twelve hours anterior to high water.

Also the mean of the three years, giving about 14 inches depression of tide

to one inch rise of barometer.
   " I have also taken the sums of the'residues left after introducing the baro-

meter correction, first, contemporaneously with high water, and secondly,

at twenty-four hours anterior to high water, for the first six months of the
year 1 834, measuring the residue at about every high water. The total re-
sidues, in the two cases, were so nearly alike, as to leave it doubtful which
epoch should be preferred. The diagram for 1834, made from observations

of the barometer twenty-four hours anterior to high water, appears about as

good as the one from contemporaneous observations of barometer and tide.

The extreme groups, however, for 29*2, '3, "4 inches,  30*4, "5, '6 inches

barometer, approximate slightly towards the mean line : the same tendency

appears in the double groups 29*2, '3, "4, "5 inches,  30*2, '3, '4, "5 Inches,

for 1839, barometer observed contemporaneously with, and at twelve hours

anterior to, high water. Hence I should be disposed to infer, that we do not

improve the result by going back to an anterior epoch ; for I take it for granted
that the true epoch is that which shows the greatest amount of elevation and

depression of tide corresponding with the least and greatest heights of the

barometer ; or that which makes the greatest angle of inclination between
the line connecting the several points or groups, and the axis.

   "There is one peculiarity which I have noticed in these barometrical results,

and in others which I obtained in my earlier trials, namely, that the effect
--32 REPORT 1841.

produced on the heights when the barometei' is at any point below 29'4<

inches or 29'5 inches, is always greater than the proportion for the greater
heights of the barometer. I imagine this arises from the effect of wind,
which generally follows a great depression of the barometer, and generally,
with us, comes from the S.W. ; so that an additional elevating cause comes
into operation. This, however, is mere conjecture."

    I then requested that, instead of arranging the observed heights according
to the barometer, he would correct the observed heights for lunar and solar
parallax and declination, and investigate the effect of atmospheric pressure
on the residues ; still comparing the contemporaneous and the anterior epochs.

The following was the result.
                                                                                     "March 17, 1841.

   "I send you the results of comparisons of the residues of height for 1834,
1835 and 1836, with the state of the barometer at different epochs. The
heights Avere calculated carefully by numbers, using what I consider to be

my best corrections for lunar and solar parallax and declination, and em-

ploying the same corrections in each of the three years. The only correc-
tion omitted was that for the diurnal inequality. The residues for 1834<
were compared with the barometer contemporaneous, twelve hours anterior,
twenty-four hours anterior, twenty-four hours posterior, and the extreme
groups, with barometer, thirty-six hours anterior ; in order to find what pro-
gressive changes of form the curves would thus be made to assume. The
mean correction for one inch difference in height of barometer having been
obtained, the proportional correction was applied to each observed height of
high Avater, and the mean of all the errors (remaining after the barometrical

correction) then taken for the whole year. In every instance the contempo-

raneous barometer gives the best correction. Thus in 1834 the mean error

remaining, after applying the barometrical correction, is

                       5"817 inches contemporaneous barometer.
                        6'085 inches barometer twelve hours anterior,
                        6*221 inches barometer twenty-four hours anterior,
                        6*248 inches barometer twenty-four hours posterior.

    "These two latter epochs, the one a7iterior the oihev posterior, producing
nearly equal errors, seem to show (like equal altitudes) that the truth lies
midway between them,

    " In like manner, the mean residual error for 1 835 is

                    5'277 inches, barometer contemporaneous,
                    5"421 inches, barometer twelve hours anterior,
                    5*706 inches, barometer twenty-four hours anterior

and for 1836 is

                    6*450 inches, barometer contemporaneous,
                    6*535 inches, barometer twenty-four hours anterior.

    " The introduction of the correction for the contemporaneous barometer re-
duces the mean error, previously remaining, about one-fourth, being as 1 :

0*753, for the whole of the year 1834 ; and as 1 : 0*705 for the year 1835.
    " The mean effect on the tide corresponding to a change of one inch in the

mercurial column was carefully obtained, by taking into account the number
of observations in each parcel, so as to get the true average. The con-
temporaneous barometer gives, in every instance (as shown in the diagrams),
the greatest result : and in this case also equal differences from the maximum

                                                                                                                                      I
       ON THE DISCUSSION OF LEITH TIDE OBSERVATIONS.  33

" The mean depression of tide corresponding to 1 inch rise of barometer, is

                 inches.

       For 1834  13"4 (contemporaneous barometer),

       1835      14-6 (      ditto  ditto  ),
       1836      11-9 (      ditto  ditto  ).

                              Mean. ... 13'3 for three years."

    Thus this last investigation appears to have put a negative upon the

supposition that the barometric correction of the height of high water cor-

responds to an anterior epoch ; for we cannot doubt the justice of the re-
mark made by Mr. Bunt, that since not only the contemporaneous barometer
gives the greatest result, but since also equal differences from the maximum

attend the epochs anterior and posterior by twenty-four hours, the contem-

poraneous epoch must be the true one. And thus it appears that the effect

of atmospheric pressure on the height of the tide is something local and im-
mediate, not an effect transmitted in a finite time from some other place.

   I next wished Mr. Bunt to try how far the correction curves of height for
lunar and solar parallax and declination would have been different if the

barometric correction had been m&die first, before the heights were arranged
for the other corrections. This also he undertook. The following is his
communication on the subject.

                                                                                                                 "April, 1841.

   "I send you new correction curves made from the observed heights in 1839,
after haw'mg first cleared them of the effects of the changes of atmospheric
pressure, allowing 13^ inches of water to one inch difference in the barome-
tric column. The greatest difference is in the solar declination curve at the
hour 65 of transit. I hardly think this can be entirely owing to the atmo-
spheric correction, but most likely to some difference in the working out of
the new lunar corrections, especially that for declinations, with which the
solar declination is almost inseparably mixed up in any short series of obser-
vations. Indeed I can scarcely see how the effects of the two kinds of decli-
nation can be separated, with any certainty, about the hours of 0'' and Q^
transit, except by taking two sets of observations, the one having the moon's
declination a maximum, and the other a minimum."

   The very small differences between these correction curves in their former
shape, and as modified by allowing for the barometric correction, might have
been expected, since the barometric correction will, on the whole, compen-
sate itself. The smallness of the differences is, however, evidence of the
care and consistency with which our results were formerly obtained.

                                                                            W. Whewell.

    Trinity CoUege, Cambridge, July 1, 1841,

Report on the Discussion of Leith Tide Observations, executed by Mr.

   D. Ross, of the Hydrographer's Office, Admiralty, under the direc-

   tion of the Rev. W. Whewell.

Although tables of the corrections of the heights and time of high water,

due to lunar parallax and declination, have already been obtained for several

places, (London, Liverpool, Plymouth, and Bristol) it is still desirable to cor-

rect and confirm these results by the discussion of observations made at other

places, especially if continued for a considerable series of years. Our methods

of discussion and tabulation may admit of improvement, and new features

may appear in the new results ; with these views I applied at the last meeting

1811.                     D
--34 REPORT 1841.

of the Association for the sum of 50/. to enable Mr. Ross to complete the

discussion of a series of tide observations made at Leith, extending from 1827

to 1839 inclusive, and now including 184'0. This long series of years is ad-

vantageous for the purpose of obtaining the declination correction ; since, in

consequence of the motion of the moon's nodes, the range of lunar declina-

tion and the mean declination is verj- different in different years ; as was

stated in my Report on the subject, presented to the Association last year.

The present Report will i-efer to a new mode of presenting the corrections

of the height of high water for lunar parallax and declination. It has been

shown by me in various memoirs that the correction of the height both for

lunar parallax and declination is nearly the same for all the hours of moon's

transit. This being the case, the greater part of this correction may be ex-

pressed by means of a table of double entry ; the two arguments being the

moon's parallax and declination. Mr. Ross suggested to me the advantage

of such a table, and has constructed it from the Leith observations, and it is

laid before the Association along with the present Report.

It appears by this table, when separated into the two parts dependent upon

parallax and declination, that the parallax correction varies very exactly as the

parallax; and that the declination correction applicable to declination , varies
very nearly as the square of the declination ; results agreeing both with those

obtained from the tide observations made at other places, and with the conse-

quences of the equilibrium theory modified, as I have previously shown that it

must be, in order to express the results of observation. As I have stated, the

principal part of the correction of the height of high water for lunar parallax

is constant for all hours of moon's transit. But there is a further term of this

correction, though a small one, which goes through a cycle of positive and

negative values in the course of a semilunation. This has already appeared

in the results of the London, Liverpool, Plymouth, and Bristol observations,

Aand also agrees with the theory above referred to.      like result appears in

the results of Leith tides by the discussions now reported, but at first sight

with a remarkable difference. At Plymouth it appeared (Ninth Series of Tide

Researches, Phil. Trans. 1838), that the correction for parallax is least when

the hour of moon's transit is 10*^, and greatest when the hour of moon's

transit is 4^ or 5*^ ; the mean parallax correction when the part depending on

the hour of transit disappears, occurs at transit l"* and 1'^. At Leith, on the

contrary, the effect of the parallax is greatest when the transit is about 6"^,
least when the transit is 0^ and the mean value obtains when the transit is

about 3"^ and 9**. But this great difference in the results, which at first ap-
pears to make the course of this correction nearly opposite at the different

places, is, in fact, the result of the difference of the time which the original

tide-wave employs in reaching Plymouth and Leith. This correction varies

nearly as the sine of the double angle of the moon from the sun, minus a

certain epoch. Or to be more exact, instead of the sine we may substitute a

circular function, which vanishes, and is positive and negative when the sine

is, but which does not exactly follow the law of the sine. If this function be

called s, the term of which we are now speaking is, in the Plymouth tables,

-- --as 5, 2
14"                   in the Leith tables it is as s, 2  IS**. The difference of
                   ;

the epochs, \\^ and 18'', depends on the time of transmission of the tide

from Plymouth to Leith. This is further illustrated by remarking that in

--the results of London observations this term is also represented by *, 2  IS*"
--while the Bristol observations give the term s, 2</) 15*^.

The agreement of these results cannot but be considered as decisive evi-

dence of the correctness of the tables which M'e have obtained, as to their

form and general law. And this is the more remarkable when we consider
ON THE DISCUSSION OF LEITH TIDE OBSERVATIONS.  35

how small are the results in which this coincidence is found. The coefficient
of the term now spoken of, is at Loudon 3 inches ; at Plymouth it is 1 inch

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

at Bristol, when the rise and fall is very great, this coefficient is 6 inches
at Leith, by the present discussion, its amount is found to be little more than
1 inch. The smallness of this term also leads us to this inference, that
Mr. Ross's table of double entry may be used to obtain the corrections of
heights for parallax and declination, almost without a sensible error. The
table being obtained from Leith observations, will require a constant multi-

plier to adapt it to other places.

UPON THE WORKING OF WHEWELL's ANEMOMETER. 37

the hourly meteorological observations at the Dockyard, we are entitled to

say, so far as our experiments extend, that there is an annual movement of

the atmosphere in this latitude toward the north, under a mean pressure of

29*900 inches nearly, taken at the level of the sea, and a mean temperature of

52° Fahr. The complete and satisfactory working of the anemometer, now

that it has undergone certain amendments, found by experience desirable, leads

me to hope that its use will be persevered in by observers in meteorology, since

the principle on which it has been founded is undoubtedly very perfect and

satisfactory. I do not, after a very critical examination, and experience in the

use of the instrument, see any difficulty whatever in respect to its mechanism

which may not be easily conquered ; and it only now remains to find what

are the actual numerical values of its indications ; that is to say, having been

enabled to trace an annual movement of the air in the direction above stated,

we should at the same time be enabled to determine the rate of the motion.

WeThis would seem at first sight a sufficiently difficult matter.  may hope,

however, to arrive at something like a fair approximation to such information,

by the following mode of experiment, now in progress.

With a view of determining the amount of pressure as observable by ex-

posing surfaces varying in dimensions to the aerial current, the poi'table gauge

I  represented in the annexed figure has been suc-

   Acessfully applied.                       brass quadrant d e, being

   set in a frame of brass and divided in the usual

   way, a pressure plate a is so applied on the top

   of the frame as to act by a rod h I, and a silk

   line over intervening pulleys on the spiral spring

   6; the pulley c fixed in the centre of the quadrant

   carries the index cf, which will rise on the gra-

   duated arc in proportion to the pressure, the

   amount of this pressure in terms of a standard

   of weight being known by experiment, that is,

   by placing different weights on the extremity of

   the rod held in a vertical position, and observing

   the corresponding degrees on the arc. If Lind's

   gauge be employed as a standard, we may readily

examine the pressures corresponding to various pressure plates, and thus dis-

cover whether the same pressure on a unit of area is shown by different sized

plates. This being determined, we are in a state to employ plates of different

dimensions according to the violence of the wind, and hence readily compare

the pressure with the velocity more easily.

To find the velocity by experiment, a cork stuck round with capacious

feathers is made to travel over a fine wire of a given length by the force of

the wind ; the cork is set on a common writing quill bushed with a small brass

plate at each end, and by which the whole is supported on the wire, fine holes

being drilled through tlie brass plates for receiving it. This contrivance
is extremely light, and will fly along the wire with the velocity of the wind

for a given distance, or very nearly so. It is in fact throwing, as it were, a

log-line upon the air. Observers may now compare the pressures, correspond-

ing to certain velocities, and to the descent of the pencil on the anemometer

and thus its indications are reducible by experiment to terms of absolute value,

when a sufficient number of observations have been made and tabulated.

Report of a Committee, consisting of Sir J.W.F. HERSCHEL,J5«r^., ikfr.

   WHEWEhL.fthe VeryRev. theDE AN OF^i.\, Prof hijOYD, andLieut.

    Col. Sabine, appointed for the purpose of superintending the scien-
    tific co-operation of the British Association in the system of Simul-
    taneous Observations in Terrestrial Magnetism and Meteorology.

 Your Committee, referring to their last Report for the history of the mag-

 netic operations in progress up to the date of that Report, have to state, in

--continuation, that the magnetic observatory at St. Helena was finished, and

 the instruments established, in August 184-0, at Toronto in September,
 and at Van Diemen's Land in October of the same year. The observatory at
 the Cape of Good Hope also was completed and in activity at the commence-
 ment of March in the current year, delays having occurred in its completion,
 which, though productive of great uneasiness and distress to its officer in
 superintendence, Lieut. Eardley Wilmot, could in no way be attributed to
 any want of exertion, or to any negligence on his part. From each of these
 stations returns have been regularly received since their respective dates of
 completion. Previous to this, there have been received returns of seven
 months of observation in a temporary observatory at Toronto, and of six at
 St. Helena. All the observations, as soon as received, have been regularly
 transmitted to Prof. Lloyd, and after examination by him, handed over to

--Col. Sabine, under whose superintendence, assisted by Lieut. Riddell the

--state of whose health, unfortunately, has compelled his return from Toronto
     their publication will take place. Government having, on the application of
 the Royal Society, taken upon themselves this additional expense. In conse-
 quence of this arrangement, the reduction and printing of the observations
 are now in progress. The portable observatories of the Erebus and Terror
 were put up at Kerguelen's Land, and also at Van Diemen's Land. At the

--former station, the May and June terms were observed at the latter, those

 of August and September 1840. During the stay of the expedition at these
 stations, the magnetometers were observed hourly ; and the regular work of
 the observatory at the latter station, under the direction of Lieut. Kay, has
 been begun, and will be continued on this doubly-laborious plan of hourly
 intervals for the ordinary observations ; while on the term-daj's, all the three

--magnetometers will be observed at the same instants of time, at intervals of

 2^ minutes, the means of confronting this vast increase of labour being sup-
 plied by the Colonial Government, as administered by that ever-active and

 zealous friend of science, Sir J. Franklin. And in addition to this, and for

 the sake of multiplying occasions of observing the correspondence of magnetic

--perturbations with auroral discharges, one hour out of every 24 viz. from

--Ih. 50m. P.M. to 2h. 50m. p.m., Gottingen mean time, commencing from

 January 1, 1841 will be occupied with observations of the magnetometers,
 at 2\ minutes' interval, in this order, viz. bifilar, declination ; vertical force,
 declination ; bifilar, declination, V, D, B, D, &c. It is to be hoped that
 some of the European observatories will, at least occasionally, furnish obser-
  vations in correspondence with these.

    The reduction and publication of the observations made at the Van
 Diemen's Land observatory and by Captain Ross's expedition have also, at

 the request of the Admiralty and with the consent of the Master General of
 the Ordnance, been placed under the superintendence of Lieut.- Colonel

  Sabine.

     The first Report of the Director of the Madras Observatory (Lieut. Lud-
 low), and the first month's observations, have been received. It commenced
 regular observation on the 1st of January 1841.
          ON TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM AND METEOROLOGY. 39

   The private observatory established at Mukerston in Scotland, by the mu-
nificence of Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Macdougal Brisbane, has been com-
pleted in instruments, and has commenced observation. In addition to the

terms, a portion of the usual daily routine of magnetical and meteorological

observations will be kept up at this observatory.

   Of the foreign European observatories, Brussels (M. Quetelet), Prague

(Herr Kreil), and Milan (Sig. Carlini), have regularly forwarded the term-
observations for each month to the Royal Society. The Cadiz observatory

has been completed in instruments, and its director, M. Montojo, has person-

ally visited Dublin, to receive Prof. Lloyd's instructions in the process of ob-

sei-vation. In consequence of an application made to the Belgian Govern-
ment by the Royal Society, through Lord Palmerston, the establishment of the

Brussels observatory has been provided with the assistance necessary to carry
out the complete system of observation recommended by the Royal Society.

   From Breslau a letter has been received from M. Boguslawski, dated

July 3, giving an account of the progress of that establishment, the instru-
ments for which, it will be recollected, were supplied by this Association.

Annexed to this letter are the projected term-observations for August and
November 1840. It will be necessary to provide expressly for the final dis-
posal of the returns which will arrive from this quarter.

   The Council of the Royal Society had devoted a sum of money from their
Wollaston Donation Fund for the purchase of a set of instruments for the

magnetic observatory, the erection of which at Alton, near Hammerfest, was,
at the date of the last Report of this Committee, under consideration by the

Norwegian Government. Some difficulties have presented themselves since,
which will probably prevent, or materially modify, the accomplishment of
this object, or substitute for observations at Hammerfest a series to be made
at Christiania, under the direction of M. Hansteen. Be this as it may, this

liberality on the part of the Royal Society was highly opportune, inasmuch
as it left disposable the grant placed at the disposal of your Committee at the

last meeting.

   Under the head of " Observatories entirely new," your Committee have to
announce the projected establishment of a private one at Havaiiah, by Drs.
Belot and Jorg, which from the geographical position of the station will be

extremely valuable.

   The term-days of May and August 1840 have been both remarkable for

the magnitude of the disturbances. Mr. Riddell has undertaken to have all
the observations of these two days projected in curves, which will probably

be completed and laid before the Association at this meeting.

   By a letter received from M. KupfFer, dated 25th March 1841, it appears

thatthe observations in the magnetic observatory at St. Petersburgh com-
menced on the 1st of January, and at Caterinenbourg on the 10th of March.
In the course of the summer they will be commenced at Helsingfors ; and at
Tiflis, in all probability, during the autumn. The total number of magnetical

observatories which may at present be reckoned on as brought, or about to

be brought, into effective co-operation, is fifty-one.

   On the 12th of November 1840, the Erehis and Terror left Hobart Town

for their first summer's research in the Antarctic Circle, leaving Lieut. Kay,

with Messrs. Dayman and Scott as his assistants, in charge of the ob-

servatory at Ross Bank. During the temporary sojourns of the expedition
on land or ice, the observations will be made on the same enlarged plan as at
 Hobart Town. Their first term will, in all probability, have been observed
 in November at the Auckland Islands. The first point to be determined

would be, the point of maximum intensity in the southern hemisphere, the
--40 REPORT 1841.

 meridian of which had been indicated by the daily observations in the pass-

 age from Kerguelen's Land to Van Diemen's Land, leaving only its latitude
 undecided. Having accomplished this, they will proceed, as rapidly as cir-

 cumstances will permit, to seek and determine the position of the point of
 vertical dip. The observations at sea, it should be mentioned, succeed to the

 fullest extent of the most sanguine expectations ; so much so, that the three

 magnetic elements are daily observed on board, with a precision perfectly
 adequate to the actual demands of magnetic science.

     Intimately connected with a system of simultaneous observations at central

 stations, is the subject of magnetic surveys of the surrounding districts. It
 is only by reference to such central stations as zero points, that itinerant de-
terminations can be divested of the influence of temporary and casual mag-
 netic derangement, and brought into comparability with the general mag-
 netic system of the globe. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance that
 every advantage should be taken of the present fortunate conjuncture to secure
the ivhole benefit of the simultaneous system, and to extend it from points

over districts. Itinerant observations, made on a concerted system, and pre-

cisely simultaneous with those at the fixed observatories, will acquire (if accu-

rately made) all the value of stationary ones, becoming, ipso facto, and at
each instant, reducible to a central station. Moreover, by this means alone
can the amount of station-error for each element, at the central stations them-
selves, be ascertained ; by which is meant, all that part of each resolved ele-
ment of the magnetic force, which, not being participated in by the surround-
ing district, must be attributed to attractions merely local and accidental.
Without such surveys, executed at some epoch, this error cannot be even
approximately fixed. If executed at this particular time, not only will it be
settled with precision, but the surveys will become an integrant part of
the whole mass of observation, and be rendered infinitely more valuable as

data for future reference, than they could possibly be, if deferred till after
the conclusion of the stationary observations.

    Under this impression, it is highly gratifying to your Committee to be en-

--abled to announce, that one very important survey of this kind that of the
--British possessions in North America has, on the application of the Presi-
--dent and Council of the Royal Society, been undertaken by Government, on

a scale both liberal and satisfactory a young, ardent, and instructed officer,
Lieut. Younghusband, R.A., qualified for the work by a residence and prac-
tice in magnetic observation in the observatory at Toronto, having been added
to the establishment of that observatory, with a view to this especial ser-
vice, for three years, with a non-commissioned officer as his assistant, fur-
nished with every instrumental requisite, a liberal provision for travelling
expenses, and with the promise of gratuitous canoe conveyance, from the
Hudson's Bay Company, in the territories belonging to them. In anticipa-
tion, moreover, of a similar magnetic survey of South Africa, though as yet
no formal application for such a survey has been made, the Master-Gene-
ral of the Ordnance has ordered a second officer of Artillery (Lieut. Clerk)

to be attached to the observatory at the Cape of Good Hope.
   As regards this important department of the general subject, your Com-

mittee have further to notice the magnetic survey of British Guiana, which
has been undertaken by Mr. Schomburgk, one of the Commissioners appointed
by Government to determine the boundaries of that province, and who, on an
application to that effect on the part of the Royal Geographical Society, has
been supplied by your Committee, from the grants placed at their disposal,

--with a transportable magnetometer (to be returned when the Avork is com-

plete) the receipt of which is acknowledged by a letter from the Secretary
           ON TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM AND METEOROLOGY. 41

of that body, dated Feb. 10, IS^l. Nor must your Committee pass in silence
the instructions given, and the instruments supplied by Government, (in du-

--plicate, and with complete instructions for the use of each,) also on applica-
--tion from the President and Council of the Royal Society, to the African

Expedition, for the purpose of observation in the course of that expedition.

From the scientific zeal which distinguishes many of the officers of that ex-

--pedition, scarcely inferior to that zeal in the cause of humanity which has

--led them to enter on so perilous a service, results highly valuable to mag-

netic science may be expected. The transportable magnetometer being one
of their instruments, observations on term-days during some months, corre-

sponding with those in Guiana, will probably be obtained, and thus localities,
otherwise of high interest, and remote from any central station, will be bound

together.

   Mr. Caldecott, Astronomer to His Highness the Rajah of Travancore,
whose magnetical observatorj^, completely furnished in instruments, com-

menced its operations on the May term-day of the present year, has also de-

clared his intention to undertake the magnetic survey of Southern India;

while in the north of that empire we may expect, from the zeal and energy

of Capt. Boileau, that no exertions on his part will be wanting to secure a

similar advantage in that quarter.
    In all such surveys it is highly desirable that a regular and concerted sy-

stem of observation should be followed, and above all things, that the con-

dition of exact conformity to the hours of simultaneous observation should

be adhered to ; as well as that, if practicable, all determinations of important

points, intended to be made with particular care and exactness, should be

performed on the term-days ; which object, by the exercise of a certain de-

gree of forethought in laying out the plan of travel, may doubtless be accom-

plished in the great majority of instances.

Connected with, and of importance to, the practical working of the obser-

vatories, your Committee beg leave to call attention to Prof. Lloyd's supple-

mentary paper, " On the Mutual Action of permanent Magnets," in which

those conditions of equilibrium are investigated which it is possible to satisfy,

independent of the relative forces of the magnets. In this paper, independent

of the practical utility of the rules laid down for the disposal of the magnets

in fixed observatories, the demonstration of the extreme minuteness of the
possible amount of uncompensated error arising from mutual attraction can-

not but be regarded as highly satisfactory.
   Finally, your Committee have to report on their employment of the grant

of 50/., placed at their disposal at the last meeting, which they have expended
on the purchase of a transportable magnetometer, by Meyerstein, of Gottin-

gen, for the Guiana survey. Some improvements, not contemplated origin-

ally, having been introduced into the construction of this instrument, its total
cost, including freight, somewhat exceeded this sum, leaving a balance of

121. 2s. against the Committee, for which it is necessary they should pray an

indemnity, as well as a continuance of the grant of money placed at their

disposal.  Signed, on the part of the Committee,

that a thermometer was not sent, because Mr. Newman informed Col. Sabine

that an excellent standard thermometer had been ordered by Mr. M'Cord
himself, and had been forwarded to him. The cost of the mountain barome-
ter was 6/. 12s. 6d.

Report of a Committee, consisting of Sir J. Herschel only, to super-

 --intend the reduction of Meteorological Observations. July 1841.

During the last year several series of observations for the years 1837 and

 1838, as well as a few for 1839, have dropped in, and every endeavour has
been made to procure copies of such as were still wanting from stations
whence there was reason to presume that observations were forwarded but
had never come to hand. These endeavours, in several instances, have proved
successful, and in consequence the list of stations at which available series,
having some degree of consecutiveness and connexion, can be made out, is
considerably enlarged. The whole number of series in hand, and under re-
duction at present, amounts to upwards of three hundred, being the results
of observations at about seventy stations.

    In the year elapsed, Mr.Birt has been employed intabulating, reducing, pro-
jecting, and comparing the barometric curves, a process which has been com-
pleted for the whole of the American group (which is by far the most numerous
and consecutive) for the years 1835, 1836, 1837, and for March 1838, com-
prising eighty-eight series, made at the following twenty-eight stations, viz

   The tabulated results of these reductions, and their projected curves, accom-
pany this Report for the inspection of the Meeting. The curves are pur-
posely projected on a large scale (too large for publication) to afford room
for a minute examination and analysis of their several inequalities, with a view

to the possibility of tracing the progress of subordinate undulations or of

cross waves ; and each has been made by Mr. Birt the subject of particular
and careful discussion, the results of which he has embodied in the form of

notes on the, several terms. Many of these contain remarks of much interest,

especially that on the December term of 1836, which fortunately comprises

the ascending branches of the barometer curves during a remarkable storm,
as well as others, which however must be reserved for the final report of your

Committee, which it may be confidently stated will be ready for presenting

at the next Meeting.
   Meanwhile the annexed letters from Mr. Birt will serve to give the Meet-

ing somewhat more than a general idea of the direction which the inquiry is

taking, and contain some suggestions relative to a system of concerted ob-
servation excellently well adapted to the tracing of atmospheric waves across

a tract of country, to which, as well as to his offer to undertake the necessary

correspondence, your Committee desires to direct the especial attention of the

Meeting.  (Signed) J. F. W. Herschel.

                                       " Metropolitan Literary and Scientific Institution, June 1, 1841.

 --" Dear Sir, I exceedingly regret that I have been unable to forward you

the packet containing the projections, &c. of the American observations until

so long after the time mentioned in my last. I was extremely anxious not to

omit any point that suggested itself in carefully looking over the projections
and tables, and having completed this, I hope the packet will reach you in
sufficient time to enable you to draw up the report for the Meeting without

inconvenience.

   " The remarks I have to offer I have thrown in the form of notes to each

sheet of the projections. In these notes I have taken very little, if any, no-

tice of the curves south of the United States, the Bahamas, &c. I may how-
ever remark here, that the curves at the Bahamas generally differ from those

of the United States ; and as they are situated near the northern border of
the torrid zone this difference is remarkable and interesting, as it indicates
different systems of oscillation peculiar to the zones. Numerous observations
from tlie Bahamas, and the West India islands generally, would be highly in-

teresting.

   " One point which I have glanced at in the notes appears to me interesting

and worthy of attention in future observations and discussions of this kind,
namely, the appearance of the diurnal oscillation when the extent of oscilla-
tion at the station is small, for instance under O'l inches. Generally as the

oscillation increases the diurnal oscillation becomes obscured.
    " With respect to the tables and projections, I have very carefully examined

them, and I am not conscious of any errors existing ; the reductions I have

carefully verified in every instance, and the amount of error in the projections

is not greater than '0005 in the readings of the barometric altitudes ; this

amount of error arises from hygrometric causes.
    " With respect to the increase of oscillation, as mentioned in the concluding

remarks to the notes on the projections, it appears that the stations from
which observations have hitherto been obtained are too few to derive correct

conclusions relative to it. Probably, on one or two occasions that may be
fixed on for future observations, a number of gentlemen may undertake a

scries of observations of the barometer, having especially this object in view,
--44 REPORT 1841.

once or twice, who might not wish to continue such observations at stated

periods. Our universities and academies, and most of, if not all, our pro-

vincial institutions, would probably join in this object, and by appointing a

day sufficiently remote, many gentlemen who would thus engage in the work

Mould have an opportunity of communicating with their friends, and thus a

sufficient number of stations well scattered in different and suitable parts of

the country might be obtained. It appears, however, that in order effectually

to obtain the object in view, it would be desirable to modify in some degree

the observations as they have hitherto been conducted ; for, in order to obtain

the whole extent of oscillation at any station, it would be necessary to obtain

a complete depression and elevation of the barometric curve. Thus a time
would be iixed on for a simultaneous commencement of the observations at

all the stations, say 6 a.m. ; but the termination of the observations would

depend on the attainment of the elevation or depression of the curve, as the

case might be ; so that if the barometer was falling at the commencement of
the observations, they would terminate when the greatest altitude had been

obtained ; three or four hours' observation after this point had been observed,
would probably be sufficient to indicate the change in the character of the

curve. By thus conducting the observations the extent of oscillation at each

station would be distinctly obtained, as the lowest and highest points of the

barometer would have been observed. Perhaps you will have the kindness

to give this subject your consideration, and should it appear to you worth the

trouble, I shall be most happy to undertake the management of a correspond-

ence relative to it.  " I have the honour to be, dear Sir,

--" Dear Sir, 1 have very carefully examined the curves obtained in the

British Isles, also those in Europe, and have embodied the results of this

examination in the accompanying notes and tables.

" The striking difference between the atmospheric affections in the British

Isles and those of Europe, is highly interesting ; also the difference in the

lengths of the undulations observed at the European stations, the western

stations exhibiting the longest. On this point, however, I apprehend the ob-

servations are not sufficiently numerous to allow of the slightest conjecture

being entertained, with the exception that there might have existed several

centres of oscillation, the entire systems extending over comparatively small

areas, similar to those indicated by the American observations, I believe, of

September 1837.       " 1 remain, dear Sir, yours very respectfully,

Report of a Committee, consisting of Sir J. Herschel, Mr. Whe-

 WELL, and Mr. Baii^y, for revising the Nomenclature of the Stars.

As regards the collection of synonyms, the detection of errors originating in

mistakes of entry, copying, printing, or calculation, and their rectification,
and the restriction within their just boundaries of the existing constellations,
the work of your Committee has been progressive. Owing, however, to the
unfortunate accident which has recently befallen one of its members, by

whom this department of the work had been especially taken in hand, no

precise report at this time can be made of the progress made.
   As regards the revision and redistribution of the southern constellations, a

catalogue has in the first place been prepared of all stars within the circle of
NOMENCLATURE OP THE STARS.  45

70° S.P.D, down to the fifth magnitude, with their present actual magnitudes
as determined by a series of observations made expressly for that purpose
which catalogue is now in course of printing and publication by the Royal
Astronomical Society. With the magnitudes of this catalogue a chart has
been constructed, of which several copies have been made. These have been
employed for the purpose of grouping the stars in various ways (wfthout re-
gard to existing constellations), and with reference only to forming among
themselves the most compact and striking groups which their distribution in

the heavens admits, and which the correctness obtained in the magnitudes

has now for the first time rendered practicable. After trying many systems,

and arranging the groups in a great variety of ways, your Committee have at
length agreed on adopting, as the boundaries of the new regions into which
they propose distributing the soutliern stars, only arcs of meridians and par-
allels of declination for a given epoch ; thus including each region within a
quadrilateral rectangular figure, whose angular points being tabulated in right

ascension and declination, may be treated as artificial stars, and thus brought
up by the usual tables of precession to any other epoch, their situation among
the stars being unchanged. Thus it will become a mere matter of inspection

of a catalogue arranged for the original epoch (which they propose to be that

of the Royal Astronomical Society's forthcoming new Catalogue), which re-
gion any given star shall belong to.

    Proceeding then to assign more particularly the limits of the several regions,
they have succeeded in forming an arrangement in which (subject to such
revision and modifications as may arise between this and their final report)
they feel disposed to rest. Meanwhile, however, as it is of great importance

that whatever system they may finally adopt should have the sanction of the

astronomical world in general, it has been thought advisable in the first in-

stance to lay before the public an outline of the general plan, together with

a reduced sketch of the proposed regions (subject to such revision), with a

view to making more generally known its principles, and assembling around
it, in the event of its approval, that body of support and assent, of which, as
 an innovation, it must stand in need. This has accordingly been done in a
paper read by one of the members of your Committee to the Astronomical
Society, and (witli the catalogue above-mentioned) now in course of publica-
tion. This being largely distributed among astronomers by the printing an
extra number of copies, will, it is expected, lead to the final maturation and
 reception of the plan. [It was hoped that the printing of this paper, and the
 accompanying engraving, would be far enough advanced to have enabled
 copies to be distributed at the present Meeting of the Association ; but this

 not being the case, proof-sheets of the paper and of the reduced skeleton
 chart are, at all events, annexed to this Report for inspection and perusal by

such members as may wish it.]
    As respects the nomenclature of the new regions, the Committee are at

 present engaged in considering it ; but some principles, Avhich will probably
 influence their recommendation when the subject is sufficiently advanced for
 that step, are stated in the paper already alluded to, which will appear in the
 forthcoming volume of the Transactions of the Royal Astronomical Society.

     But the same necessity (grounded on the incorrectness of magnitudes as
 laid down in all existing charts) exists for a revision of the northern as well
 as southern stars in this respect. It therefore becomes worthy of considera-

 tion whether a similar plan may not advantageously be carried into execution

 in both hemispheres ; and as, at all events, the actual state of the celestial
 charts in both is such as to admit of great improvement from an assemblage

 of mpre correct photometric data, a general review of all the stars down to
--46 REPORT 1841.

the fifth magnitude, with this especial object in view, has been undertaken

by one of the members of the Committee, conducted on the same plan, the

principle of which is explained in the paper alluded to. This review is al-

ready in a considerably advanced state, and should circumstances and weather

favour will i^robably be completed before the next Meeting.

In its progress it has required the aid of skeleton charts, prepared by laying

down all the stars by dots from planispheres of received authenticity, and

sketching in the existing constellations. As the preparation of such skeletons,

which require to be very neatly and con-ectly executed, consumes a vast deal

of time and is very troublesome, they, as well as the southern charts above

alluded to (thirteen charts in all), have been procured to be executed by

Mr. Arrowsmith, which has caused an outlay to the amount of 17/. 19s. 6d.,

leaving disposable out of the original grant the sum of 32/. Os. 6d., and which

the Committee consider will be required for their future proceedings.

Report of a Committee appointed at the Glasgow Meeting of the British
    Association in September 1840, for obtaining Instruments and Re-
   gisters to record shocks of Earthquakes in Scotland and Ireland.

It is proper to explain at the outset of this Report, that it narrates only what
has been done by the three individual members of the Committee resident in
Scotland. It was found by those members impossible to communicate with
their associates in Ireland in any trials for ascertaining the instruments
adapted to the object in view. So also, in regard to the localities in Ireland
and Scotland, where these instruments should be placed, no advantage was
anticipated from a correspondence between the members of the Committee
in each country respectively, as it was exclusively those connected with, and

resident in, the country who knevv the localities where eartliquake shocks

were most frequent, and where intelligent and careful observers could be

found.

   The members of the Committee in Scotland had several meetings in the
beginning of winter to consider some new forms of instruments fitted to re-
gister the shocks commonly felt in that part of the island. Several instru-
ments of different forms had previously been constructed and fixed at Comrie
in Perthshire, but they were found not sufficiently sensitive to indicate more

than a small proportion of the shocks felt in that district.

   After a good deal of consideration and a number of trials, two kinds of in-
struments, out of several which suggested themselves, were in the first instance
resolved on. The one kind was on the principle of the common pendulum,
the other on that of the inverted pendulum, or watchmaker's noddy. One
instrument was made on the first-mentioned principle, and two on the second.

--The construction and dimensions of these will now be shortly described.
   1. Common Pendulum Seismometer. The pendulum is thirty-nine inches
in length from its point of suspension to its lower extremity. At its lower

extremity there is a piece of soft chalk in the form of a pencil, which, as the
pendulum vibrates, makes a marking on a concave piece of wood painted
black, and forming the segment of a sphere with a radius of thirty-nine inches.
This segment has white circular lines painted on it parallel with its circum-
ference, and one inch apart from each other. It has also the cardinal points
of the compass marked on it. Near the lower end of the pendulum there is
a leaden ball of about four or five pounds weight, which is perforated through

the middle, so as to admit the pendulum through it. The chalk pencil
EARTHQUAKES IN SCOTLAND AND IRELAND.  4f

presses on the wooden board by a small leaden weight resting on its upper

end, inside of a metal tube containing the pencil.

   Three wooden rods are fixed to this spherical segment, on its outer edge,
at equal distances, and unite above the basis, so as to form a point of suspen-

sion for the pendulum.

   The instrument is fixed by three feet to the floor of a room, and, with the

help of adjusting screws, the chalk is brought to the centre of the concave

segment which is to be marked by its vibrations. The concentric circles,
which are marked 1, 2, 3, &c., from the centre of the segment, indicate the
number of inches that the lower extremity of the pendulum is thrown from
the centre ; and the cardinal points show the direction from or to which the

shock has proceeded.

 --2. The Inverted Pendulum Seismometer. (1.) The smallest of the instru-

ments made on this principle has a pendulum thirty-nine inches long, and is
fixed into a brass socket at its lower end. The connexion between the pen-
dulum and the socket consists of a strong elastic wire, which, by means of a

pinching screw, can be either raised or depressed in the socket, so as to in-
crease or diminish the length and sensibility of the pendulum. There is a
leaden ball near the top of the pendulum from three to four pounds in weight
it has a hole through its centre so as to allow the pendulum rod to pass freely
through it, and it can be fixed at any part of the rod by means of a pinching

screw. At the upper extremity of the pendulum there is a soft lead pencil,
which rests on an elastic wire contained in a brass tube. The pencil is thus

pressed against a white surface of paper, forming the segment of a sphere,

having a radius of thirty-nine inches. The paper is pasted on a piece of
copper beaten into the proper shape. This copper segment rests on four
upright iron rods which are fixed into the base of the instrument. The base
consists of four corresponding flat iron bars, which cross in the middle, and
support at that point the socket above described, to which the elastic wire of
the pendulum is fixed.

    There are on the white segment of this instrument concentric lines in red
ink, an inch apart, and numbered from the centre, so as to indicate the num-
ber of inches that the pendulum is by any shock thrown off" its centre. There
are also on this segment, as on that of all the instruments, points of the com-

pass to indicate the directions of the shocks.

   The instrument is fixed firmly to the floor of the room where it is set. By

means of three adjusting screws, which affect the socket, the upper extremity
of the pendulum is brought to the centre of the segment to be marked by it.

   Any further description of this instrument is rendered unnecessary in con-

sequence of a paper by Professor Forbes, published lately in the Transactions
of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, where the mechanism and mathematical

properties of it are very clearly pointed out.

   (2.) The other instrument constructed on this principle has a pendulum
ten feet eight inches in length. The spherical segment, on which the vibra-

tions of its point are intended to be marked, is not, as in the instrument just

described, supported on upright rods fixed to its base, but is suspended over
the pendulum by a strong hold-fast of iron fixed into a wall. In other re-

spects, the mechanical construction of this instrument is much the same as

that of the former one.

    The above instruments were sent to Comrie, a small town in Perthshire,
where shocks have been very frequent during the last fifty years, and where
the earthquake of October 1839 was felt more strongly than in any other
part of Scotland. They were given in charge to Mr. Peter Macfarlane, Post-
master at Comrie, a very intelligent person, who had been assiduous in
48 BEPORT 1841.

marking down all the shocks which had occurred since October 1839, and
who had himself contrived and constructed several ingenious instruments for

 indicating the shocks.

    The three instruments were erected in Comrie and the immediate neigh-
bourhood. The largest of those on the principle of the inverted pendulum
is in the town of Comrie, and is fixed inside the steeple of the parish church.
The other instrument on the same principle is at Comrie House, situated about
a quarter of a mile to the north of Comrie, and taken care of by Colonel
Simpson, who resides there. The remaining instrument is at a place called
Garriechrow, close to Cluan Hill, about two miles west of Comrie, and is under
the immediate charge of the overseer of Sir David Dundas, Bart., of Duneira.

    These instruments were erected a few days before the 1st of January 1841.
They have been affected only twice, viz. on the 10th and 22nd of March 184'1.

On the first occasion both of the inverted pendulums had their upper extremi-
ties thrown to the west half an inch, where they remained till examined. On

the other occasion they were again thrown to the west, but scarcely half an
inch. The simple pendulum at Garriechrow has not been affected, and is
thought to be not sufficiently sensitive.

   The following inferences seem deducible from the way in which the in-

--struments were affected on these two occasions: (1.) There was, on both

occasions, a sudden horizontal movement of the ground where both instru-
ments were placed, indicated by the extremities of them being thrown off

their centres. (2.) This horizontal movement, on both occasions, was to-
wards the east. (3.) The amount of this displacement of the ground was, on
the first occasion, half an inch ; on the second, less than half an inch.

   This last-mentioned inference vvas confirmed by the feelings of those who

perceived both shocks, as they considered that the first was the most severe,
though neither was nearly half so severe as the shock of October 1839.

   Mr. Macfarlane states, however, that on both occasions there was a move-

ment of the earth's crust not indicated by the instruments. He alludes to a

vertical movement that was sensibly felt, and which on the last occasion was
indicated by one of his own instruments.

   This circumstance has been alluded to, to show the propriety of having
instruments of a different kind from the above. Several have occurred to
members of the Committee calculated for vertical movements ; and these
movements it is of some consequence to have marked and measured, as it is
believed they are always produced at Comrie when a shock occurs, and even
in cases when there may be little or no horizontal movement.

    It is also to be observed, that there is strong reason to believe that the
Comrie shocks emanate from a particular spot, the exact position of which

can only be ascertained by a number of instruments placed around the sup-

posed locality.

    It is hoped, therefore, that the Association will continue the appointment

of a Committee, and give a renewed grant of money for procuring instru-
ments and registers. From what has been said, it must be evident that the
object which was last year thought worthy of being prosecuted cannot be
properly attained without a greater number of instruments, and some of them
calculated to indicate vertical movements of the ground. It is also necessary
that they should be much more sensitive than those now used ; for, though
there were only two shocks indicated by the instruments, Mr. Macfarlane
reports, that from the 1st January 1841, when they were in operation, to the 1st
July, there were no less than twenty-seven shocks distinctly felt at Comrie.

    It is unnecessary to refer, in this Report, to the reasons which induced the

Association last year to have a regular register of the earthquake shocks oc-
       EARTHaUAKES IN SCOTLAND AND IRELAND.                            49

curring in Scotland. The light which such a register is calculated to throw

on this dark and important subject is self-evident. The Committee would
only add, that the value of such a register is now greatly enhanced by its

appearing that in other countries similar registers are kept, which will afford

data for comparing the phaeaomena as exhibited in different parts of the

earth's crust respectively, and ascertaining whether, and to what extent, they

are connected. In the volume of the Transactions of the Royal Academy of

Turin, lately published, there will be found a part of the register kept at St.
Jean de Maurienne from the 19th of December 1838, to April 1840, which

partly embraces the period comprehended in the Comrie register.

   In urging the continuance of the Committee, and of means to enable them

to prosecute the object entrusted to them, it may not be out of place to ob-

serve, that great additional interest attaches to it from the opinion entertained

by several persons who have attended to the subject, that the earthquake

shocks of this, and perhaps of other non-volcanic countries, are connected

with the state of the atmosphere, and more particularly with electrical agen-
cies. To test the accuracy of this opinion it would be desirable to have

some meteorological instruments at Comrie, and accurate registers of their

indications kept. It is unnecessary to say that this opinion, if proved to be

accurate, would open up new and most important views as to the nature and

situation of the forces which are concerned in the production of earthquakes.

If the British Association be still desirous, as it is hoped it will be, of

having inquiries prosecuted on this subject, it is recommended that a sepa-

rate Committee should be appointed for Scotland, where the shocks appear

to be more frequent than in any other part of the United Kingdom, and that

the Committee should consist of Lord Greenock, Sir John Robison, Professor

Jameson, Professor Traill, Professor Christison, Professor Forbes, Thomas

Jameson Torrie, Esq., and David Milne, Esq.

With regard to the amount of the grant, it is thought that it certainly

should not be less than what was appropriated last year, viz. 20/.

My --DEAR Sir, I sent you some days ago a Report on the earthquake in*

struments and registers which have been established at Comrie by the Com-

mittee of the British Association.

As a supplement to that Report I now beg to inform you, that on Sunday

evening, the 25th inst., there were two earthquake shocks felt at Comrie, by

both of which all the instruments set there were moved. Mr. Macfarlane

reports,, that the seismometer in Comrie parish-church had its point thrown

half an inch to the west, which indicated, therefore, a horizontal movement

of the earth towards the cast. An instrument of my own there also indi-

cated an upward movement to the extent of half an inch.

These results, as they strengthen the recommendation in the Report, that

the Committee therein suggested should be appointed, and a sum of money

given, I hope you will communicate to the Association.

       Yours very truly,                                 David Milne.

Extract from a Letter from J. Bryce, Esq., one of the Members of the Com-
   mittee, to D. Milne, Esq., dated Maghera Glebe-House, County of Lon-

donderry, July 21, 1841.

--Dear Sir, Since the Glasgow Meeting there appeared in the Irish news-

papers three notices of earthquakes having occurred ; one in the county of

Wexford and two on the North coast. I lost no time in examining into the

--authenticity of these, and I state to you the result merely, without troubling

you Avith the detail of evidence there were in reality no earthquakes, the

effects of sudden squalls were mistaken for those of earthquakes. I did not

personally collect the evidence, but by letter from a great many most intelli-

gent, accurate and trustworthy persons, on whom I fully depend.

You are already in possession of the evidence furnished by Mr. Patterson

respecting the Innishowen earthquake, about two yeai's ago. It occurred in

a district composed of granite and slate rocks, and I have no doubt of there

having been a movement of the ground such as was described.

I am, dear Sir, yours faithfully,  J. Bryce, Jun.

Report of the Committee for making Experiments on the Preservation
                             of Vegetative Powers in Seeds.

In order to carry out the objects of this Committee, it was deemed advi-
sable to draw up a series of suggestions for experiments, and to give them an
extensive circulation. The annexed document has accordingly been printed,
at a cost of 1/. 14s., and will be distributed at the present meeting.

   The Committee has yet effected but little in the way of direct experi-

ment. An application was made to the Trustees of the British Museum for

permission to make experiments on various seeds obtained from the Egyptian
catacombs. The Trustees have liberally granted permission to their officers
to select such seeds as could be spared for the purpose. Dr. Daubeny has
also made a selection of seeds from the old herbaria at Oxford. The speci-
mens thus obtained have been submitted to experiment, and the results will
be reported as soon as a sufficient number of data are collected to lead to any

general conclusions.

   To provide for the expenses incidental to these experiments, the Committee
recommend that the grant of 10/. made last year should be renewed.

                                    H. E. Strickland, Secretary to the Committee.

  --Suggestions for Experiments on the Conservation of Vegetative Powers in

Seeds. These Experiments are intended to determine the following ques-

--tions :

   1. What is the longest period during which the seeds of anj^ plant under

any circumstances can retain their vegetative powers ?

   2. What is the extent of this period in each of the natural orders, genera
and species of plants ? and how far is it a distinctive character of such

groups ?

  How3. far is the extent of this period dependent on the apparent charac-

ters of the seed; such as size, hardness of covering, hardness of internal sub-
stance, oiliness, mucilage, &c. ?

   4. What are the circumstances of situation, temperature, dryness, seclusion

from the atmosphere, &c. most favourable to the preservation of seeds ?

   To answer these questions satisfactorily will require the accumulation of a
large mass of facts ; and although there are many difficulties in the way of
such an investigation, and many years may elapse before it can be brought
to maturity, yet it is desirable that the British Association should commence

the collection of materials for the purpose. It is jsroposed then to invite
botanists and others to undertake the following series of experiments, and to
communicate the results to the British Association.

   These experiments are either Retrospective or Prospective.

cannot now take place, and by exposing these soils to air, light, warmth, and

moisture, to ascertain whether any, and if any, what, species of plants spon-

taneously vegetate in them.

   --N.B Care must of course be taken that no seeds obtain admittance
           into these soils from external sources, such as the air or water intro-

duced to promote vegetation.

These ancient soils are either natural or artificial deposits.
The natural deposits belong either to past geological periods or to the re-

cent period.

a. The deposits of past periods are either secondary or tertiary.

 --N.B. There seems every reason to believe that the age even of the

latest of these deposits is far beyond the maximum period through

which         vegetative    powers  can  be  preserved                                     yet as many accounts are
                                                                                        ;

recorded of seeds vegetating spontaneously in such soils, it would be

well to set these statements at rest by actual experiment.

In such experiments, state the formation, and describe the geological phse-

nomena of the locality, together with the depth from the present surface at

which the soil was obtained.

   h. Natural deposits of the recent period may be classed as follows :

Alluvions of rivers.

Tidal warp land.

Shell marl.

Peat.

Surface-soil buried by landslips.

              Ditto ditto by volcanic eruptions.
   In these cases, state the nature of the soil, the depth from the surface, &c.;
and especially endeavour to obtain an approximate date to each specimen of
soil, by comparing its depth from the surface with the present rate of depo-
sition, or by consulting historical records. It would be well to submit to ex-
periment a series of samples of soil taken from successive depths at the same

locality.

c. Artificial deposits are as follows :

Ancient tumuli.

Ancient encampments.

The soil beneath the foundation of buildings.
The soil with which graves, wells, mines, or other excavations have

           been filled up.

           Ridges of arable land, &c.
   In these cases, state, as before, the depth from the surface, and ascertain
from historical sources the approximate age of the deposit.

   2. By trying experiments on actual seeds which exist in artificial reposi-

tories. These are,
           Seeds in old herbaria and botanical museums.
          Seeds obtained from mummies, funereal urns, at Pompeii, Hercula-

               neum, &c.
           Dated samples of old seeds from nurserymen and seedsmen.
   In these cases, state the circumstances in which the seeds have been pre-
served, and their date as nearly as it can be ascertained.

B. Prospective Experiments.

   In this department of the inquiry, it is proposed to form deposits of va-
rious kinds of seeds under different conditions, and to place a portion of them
--52 REPORT 1841.

at successive periods under circumstances calculated to excite tlie process of
vegetation. In the case of certain species or families of plants, it would per-

haps require many centuries to determine the limit of their vegetative powers,
yet it is probable that a very few years would suffice to fix the maximum du-
ration of the greater number, and that many interesting results might thus be
obtained even by the present generation of botanists. It is proposed then to

form a collection of the seeds of a great variety of plants, (including, where-
ever it is possible, at least one species of every genus,) and to pack them up
(carefully labelled) either alone, or mixed with various materials, as sand,

sawdust, melted wax or tallow, clay, garden mould, &c. in various vessels, as
glass bottles, porous earthen jars, wooden boxes, metal cases, &c., placed in

--various situations, as under-ground, in cellars, dry apartments, &c. At cer-

tain intervals increasing in extent, say at first every two years, then every
five, every ten, and, at the lapse of a century, every twenty years, a small
number (say twenty) of each kind of seed, from each combination of circum-
stances, to be taken out and sown in an appropriate soil and temperature, and
an exact register kept of the number of seeds which vegetate compared with

those which fail.
    Should it appear desirable for this project to be carried out by the British

Association, they might most effectually accomplish it by committing a col-
lection of seeds, formed on the above plan, to some qualified person, whose
duty it should be, in consideration of a small annual stipend, to take charge
of them, and at stated periods to select portions for experiment, keeping an

accurate register of the results.

    In this manner it is believed, that in regard to the large majority of plants,
the limit of their vegetative durability would be determined in a very few
years, and that a large mass of vulgar errors on this subject, which now pass
current for facts, would be cancelled and exploded.

    --N.B. The most effectual way of exciting vegetation in seeds of great

           antiquity, is to sow them in a hot-bed, under glass, and in a light soil

             moderately watered.

            On Inquiries into the Races of Man, by Dr. Hodgkin.

Dr. Hodgkin read a Report, from which the following are extracts, respect-
ing the drawing up, printing, and circulation of Queries concerning the human

 race, for the use of travellers and others.

    " The list of Queries, as presented in a printed form to the Meeting last
year, has undergone revision and correction, and may now be regarded as

 comprising Queries relating to every branch of the subject with sufficient
 minuteness to suggest inquiry and invite reports from travellers of different

tastes and acquirements. An edition of the Queries in their present form has

 been printed off, and copies have already been extensively circVr'ated, but there
 has not been sufficient time to admit of the return of replies from those parts
 of the globe from which they are the most to be desired.

    " Copies have been furnished to the British Museum, to the Royal Geo-
 graphical Society, and to other scientific bodies, foreign as well as British.
 Considerable pains have been taken to place them in the hands of intelligent

 travellers about to visit those quarters in which natives exist, but of whom

 imperfect accounts have hitherto reached us, and whose altered condition, or

 extermination, is likely in a short time to deprive us of the possibility of ob-

 taining a knowledge of what they have been, unless it be promptly collected.

 On the occasion of the fitting out of a well-appointed expedition to ascend the

 Niger, and thus penetrate into the interior of Africa, copies were furnished
          INQUIRIES INTO THE RACES OP MAN.                                53

to the commanders of the vessels, and to the intelligent naturalists and drafts-

men who formed a part of their suite. Very recently, intelligence has reached

this country, that an expedition, well equipped on all points, is about to pro-

ceed, for the purposes of scientific inquiry, from the southern shores of the

Red Sea, in a south-westerly direction, with the hope of reaching the Cape

by a somewhat circuitous route. Should this expedition happily succeed in

its undertaking, it will necessarily have to pass through the midst of nations

and tribes of Africans, of whom a more extensive as well as correct know-

ledge is, notwithstanding all the research hitherto employed, still essentially

necessary for our possessing anything like an accurate view of the characters

and distribution of the African races, and for our arriving at any well-

grounded conclusions concerning the modes, directions, periods, and circum-

stances of their diflusion over the continent, and of the influence which they

have reciprocally excited upon each other by fusion, by reduction of num-

bers, or by the change of their physical and social condition. Several copies

of the Queries are now in the way of transmission to the gentlemen com-

posing that expedition. They are accompanied by some observations sug-

gested by circumstances peculiar to the mission, and the regions through

which it is designed to pass.

" Sir George Simpson, the Governor of the Hudson Bay Company's terri-

tory, having a few months since left this country with the intention of cross-

ing the North American Continent, from Canada to Vancouver, of visiting

the Russian settlements, and of passing over land by Kamtschatka to Peters-

burgh, the opportunity was not lost to endeavour to increase the interest

which he already has felt in the character and situation of the several tribes

whomwith  his oflScial situation necessarily  brings him  into  contact.  Copies

of the Queries were furnished, not only for the governor's own use and that

of Dr. Rowand, an intelligent medical man, partly of Indian descent, who

was expected to accompany the governor in his entire route, but also for

such residents at the Company's settlements as might be judged likely to turn

them to good account. Several copies have likewise been addressed to cor-

respondents already settled in remote situations. Although it is to be feared

that many of the copies which have been thus distributed may fail to procure

from those who receive them the direct i-eplies which they call for, it is not
too much to hope, that, from various quarters, detailed series of answers may

be received, and found in no small degree to contribute to the interest and

advantage of the sittings of this Section at future Meetings of the Associa-

tion. It is perhaps not too much to anticipate, that in this way the diffusion

of these Queries may not only serve the too-much neglected cause of the

science of Ethnography, but indirectly promote a practically benevolent

interest in some of the feeble and perishing branches of the human family.

Even in those cases in which direct replies are not obtained, some good may

not unreasonably be looked for from the juere fact of their directing the

attention of the reader to a great variety of points connected with the scat-

tered families of man. In many minds they may originate trains of thought,

and excite interest, inquiry, and investigation ; and even with tliose who
have no means of making investigations of their own, they may yet serve to

create an appetite for information of a kind which at present is, in general,

but little appreciated, and consequently but sparingly supplied. Neverthe-

less, the interests of science, of our country, and of humanity at large, arc

essentially connected with this subject. When it is considered that other

countries, which have immeasurably less direct interest in the condition of

the uncivilized sections of the human race, and who, as respects wrongs to
be atoned for, and advantages to be reaped, may be regarded as all but
--54 REPORT 1841.

 foreign to it, are notwithstanding pursuing it with zeal, it certainly behoves
 us, for the credit of our country, to endeavour to diffuse a more extensive
 and operative interest in relation to it."

    Dr. Hodgkin stated that sufficient time had not elapsed for the return of
 answers from distant countries. Some interesting information had, however,
 been elicited by them from a gentleman who had lately travelled in Texas,

where he had observed the remnants of the ancient Mexicans. He pointed

 out some of the national reasons which call for exertion on the part of
 Englishmen, and related some of the labours of foreigners, and more espe-
 cially of the Ethnographical Society of Paris, of Dr. Dieffenbach, R. H.
 Schomburgk, and other Germans, and those of the government as well as of
 individuals of the United States, and gave a description of the gallery of
 North American Indian curiosities and portraits collected and exhibited with
 great expense and pains by George Catlin, whose work on the Indians of
North America he announced as nearly ready for publication. Dr. Hodgkin
 dwelt on the importance of Ethnological researches, and on the absolute
 necessity for promptly pursuing the work if anything valuable and satis-
factory is to be accomplished ; seeing that the races in question are not only
 changing character, but rapidly disappearing.

    " It is this threatened extinction of races of men who have been either

wholly neglected or very imperfectly studied, which seems to bring this sub-
ject peculiarly within the province of this Section of the British Association.

Why should not the varieties of our own species receive as much attention

as those of inferior animals, however remarkable or rare they may be ? Has
the extinction of a variety of man ever excited equal attention with that
which has been paid to the loss of the dodo ? Or has the diminution of any

tribe of Aborigines received a proportionate share of solicitude with that
which has been given, not to the extinction of a species, but to its disappear-

ance from a particular hcality, as in the case of the ' cock of the woods,' from
the northern parts of this island ? Successful attempts have been made to
restore these animals to their ancient haunts ; and it has even been contem-

plated to restore the long-lost wild boar to the list of British wild animals.

A rare variety of the ox or the dog is preserved with unremitting care, and

often at great expense, from generation to generation ; and a rare specimen
in any department of natural history is sought with unremitting perseverance,
preserved with pains, and purchased at an almost unlimited expense. It is not
to disparage the zeal which is justly devoted to any of the various branches

to which these objects may belong, that these observations are offered ; they
are merely made for the purpose of urging that man himself, even as an object
of Natural History, may receive a degree of attention proportioned to the

Aexalted rank which he holds amongst the works of his Creator. great variety

of interests are united in ascertaining the mode in which man, as the highest

of animals, has been diffused over the surface of the globe."
    Dr. Hodgkin concluded by urging, as practical means for advancing the

cause of Ethnological investigation, first, the bringing home, for the purpose
of being studied themselves, as well as of being made the subjects of suitable
education, well-selected aboriginal youths, and especially such as have had an
opportunity of acquiring knowledge, and exhibiting ability in missionary or
other native schools. This plan, which need not equal in expense what is
often done for other objects of zoology and for botany, might be facilitated
by the union of individual contributors. Secondly, rendering personal and
pecuniary aid to the Aborigines' Protection Society, the objects of which were
neither of a party nor of a sectarian character, but were solely directed to the

preservation, amelioration, and study of the feeble races of mankind, amongst
EXPERIMENTS WITH BALLOONS.  55

which those related to British colonies occupied the chief place. Dr. Hodg-
kin observed, that the objects pursued by this Society furnished subject-
matter not merely for the Zoological, but also for the Medical and the Sta-
tistical Sections. Details of the plans, operations and present state of the
Aborigines' Protection Society may be obtained from its publications, which
are to be had at the Society's Office, 17 Beaufort Buildings, Strand. The
Queries regarding the races of man, to which this report refers, will be found

in another part of this volume.

Report of the Committee appointed to report how far the Desiderata in our
    knowledge of the Condition of the Upper Strata of the Atmosphere may be
    supplied by means of Ascents in Balloons or othertvise, to ascertain the
   probable Expense of such Experiments, and to draw up Directions for Ob-

     servers in such circumstances.

Although much valuable information might be obtained by means of

aerostatic observation, the pecuniary outlay which would be required for
this purpose is so considerable, that the Committee do not at present recom-

mend any application of the funds for this object, much less any attempt to
induce Her Majesty's Government to incur the expense, until the plan has
been more fully matured. But experience derived from ascents made under
ordinary circumstances, as opportunity may offer, would be desirable, both
as regards the kind of instruments, the mode of using them, the special

points to be attended to, the degree of concordance to be expected in results

obtained at diiferent times, places, and states of the atmosphere. The prin-
cipal objects required are, to determine the progression of temperature, and

the law of the distribution of vapour, in ascending from the surface of the
earth to the upper regions of the atmosphere. There can be no doubt that,
in a perfectly dry and undisturbed atmosphere of air, the temperature would

be found to decrease as we ascend, as the density decreases ; and that this

must be its normal state to which, amongst all its fluctuations, it must tend.
The decrease of density, however, is liable to the action of various disturbing
causes, the principal of which are the evolution of heat by the local conden-
sation of vapour, and its absorption by the evaporation of clouds. The law
of the decrease would most probably be elicited from the mean results of a
great number of careful observations, in which a compensation of such dis-
turbances Avould take place; but it cannot be expected that it should be
apparent in such a limited series as can be comprised in a single ascent. It

is probable that the temperature observed at short intervals, instead of pre-
senting a regularly decreasing progression, would exhibit great irregularities ;
as, for instance, that it would be found in a calm to decrease to a certain

point, then become steady for a time, or possibly rise, especially upon passing
through a cloud, or upon entering a current flowing in a different direction
from that upon the surface : or, if the condensation of vapour were taking
place from the action of a cold wind flowing into, and mingling with, a
saturated atmosphere, instead of arising from the regular decrease of tem-
perature due to the decreased density, a sudden and great depression would
be found. The observer's attention should be particularly directed to the
influence of clouds or changes of currents upon the thermometer. Mr. Green

has found that the isothermal planes are parallel, or nearly so, to the earth's

surface, so that the aeronaut knows generally, even although the earth may
be intercepted by a cloud, when he is crossing a chain of hills ; or at least

the upper surface of the clouds generally follows in a great measure the con-

figuration of the earth. " The upper surface of the clouds, upon occasions
--56 REPORT 1841.

when they overspread the earth at a moderate elevation, seems to accom-
modate itself to all the variations of form in the subjacent soil." Mr. Green

has also found, that it is usual to ascend to a greater elevation to experience

the same reduction of temperature when the earth is overspread with clouds
than in a cloudless sky. According to Mr. Monck Mason, a singular rela-
tion is found to exist between the formation or precipitation of rain, and the
condition of the sky above the clouds which contain it. " Whenever from a

sky completely overcast with clouds rain is falling, a similar range of clouds
invariably exists- in a certain elevation above, whereby the rays of the sun
are intercepted from the layer below ; and on the contrary, whenever, with
the same apparent condition of the sky below, rain is altogether or generally
absent, a clear expanse of firmament, with a sun unobstructed by clouds, is
the prevailing character of the space immediately above : thus leaving it a

determinate fact, that when rain is pouring from clouds overspreading the
earth, the rays of the sun are not operating upon the clouds in question
while, on the other hand, rain does not fall from such clouds when the rays
of the sun are unobstructedly falling upon the upper surface." According
to the same authority, and in conformity with the opinion of Mr. Green, it
appears that, in this country, whatever may be the direction of the wind
below, in the higher regions, that is, generally within 10,000 feet above the
surface of the earth, the direction of the wind is invariably from some point
between the north and west. It appears from Mr. Green's observations, that
" the variation experienced in the course of the wind during the progress of
the ascent was accompanied by a corresponding alteration in the intensity of
its rate, the current which at the commencement was gentle becoming strong
as it took another direction, and vice versa." These important facts in
Meteorology could not have been ascertained by any observations made at
the surface of the earth, and afford strong evidence of the advantages which
might result to science from well-planned aeronautic expeditions. With

regard to the atmosphere of vapour, it is probable that it tends to the main-
tenance of an analogous but very different progression of density and tem-
perature, from below upwards, to that of the gaseous atmosphere ; but being
constrained to diffuse itself through the latter, it is controlled and regulated

by the temperature into which it is thus forced. Thus the elasticity with
which it will rise from the surface of the earth, in the act of evaporation,
will be determined by the temperature of some upper stratum of the air, at
which it will become condensed, the force at which point will limit by its
reaction that of the evaporating surface. Between these two points, there-
fore, the dew-point will probably be found to be steady, or to decline by a
very slow progression. After passing through the cloud, it may be expected

that the dew-point will fall at once several degrees ; the elasticity of the

vapour on the upper side being probably governed and determined by a new

point of condensation in still higher regions, just as the dew-point on the
surface of the earth is conceived to be determined by the temperature of the
first vapour-plane. This would imply, that while precipitation was taking
place on one side of a bed of clouds, rapid evaporation might be going on
upon the other. It is also conceivable that these processes of condensation

and evaporation may be so adjusted as that they may exactly counteract each

other ; and the vapour-plane might thus be indicated by no cloud, or possibly

by a mere haze ; but the dew-point would fall suddenly. To this circum-

stance the observer's attention should be particularly directed. It is probable
that, in ascending to a great height, several vapour-planes might be thus
crossed, and the confirmation of the hypothesis would be of importance to
science in elucidating the constitution of the atmosphere. It is obvious that,
EXPERIMENTS WITH BALLOONS.  57

for the purposes just indicated, the observations of the thermometer and
dew-point should, if possible, be unremitted during the whole time both of
the ascent and descent, and, of course, must be accompanied by simultaneous
observations of the barometer : one person's time should therefore be wholly
devoted to these objects ; and the arrangement should be well considered, by

which his labour may be facilitated and his attention kept undistracted. The

prevailing forms and structure of the clouds ; their internal motions, if any

the number of strata which may be detected, and the number and direction
of the currents which their motion may indicate, will also form interesting

objects of observation in conjunction with the preceding. Contemporaneous
observations will, of course, be made on the earth during the time of the
aerostatic voyage, which will possess a greatly-increased interest if circum-
stances should permit it to take place on the day when hourly meteorological
observations are made at all the principal observatories of Europe, according
to the plan laid down by Sir J. Herschel. Portions of the air should be

brought down, for examination, from the highest elevations ; and this may

probably be best effected by taking up several glass balloons, or bottles care-
fully gauged, fitted with stop-cocks, and filled with water. The water should
be allowed to run out at the proper station, and the stop-cocks closed. Ex-
periments upon the radiation of heat, by another observer, would also be
interesting, although there are probably no knpwn means of instituting them
with all the accuracy which could be desired. Observations with Sir J. Her-
schel's actinometer might be made upon the force of solar radiation at various
heights ; but the instrument would not be applicable to the measurement of

terrestrial radiation. When a delicate thermometer, whose bulb is covered

with lamp-black, is placed in the focus of a parabolic reflector, and turned
towards the clear sky, even in the day-time, it will radiate a portion of its
heat into space ; by the same contrivance, the rays of heat proceeding from
the earth, or from beds of clouds, would be condensed upon the thermometer,
and some estimate formed of their intensity. Observations upon these points
at different heights, and at different periods of the day and night, would be
instructive, though not of the high importance which would belong to those

of the thermometer and hygrometei*. To these observations might be added

others of great interest upon the electricity of the atmosphere, by dropping
wires into clouds, or from stratum to stratum of cloudless air, and examining
the nature of the electricity of their extremity by means of a very delicate

electroscope : but attractive as these researches may prove, the Committee
recommend, that should a series of ascents be undertaken by one or many

observers, on no occasion should the observer's attention be distracted by too
great a variety of objects ; and that our efforts should at first be directed
solely to the elucidation of the question of the decrease of temperature, by
the acquisition of accurate contemporaneous observations of the barometer
and thermometer made at different elevations. It would manifestly be
desirable, that Avhile observations of atmospheric temperature and pressure
were made in a balloon, two observers, stationed at the extremities of an
accurately measured base, and provided with theodolites of the best con-
struction, should by their observations determine the height of the balloon
geometrically, at the instants the observations of tempei'ature and pressure
 were made. This, however, implies a more extensive system of cooperation,
 and a larger personal and instrumental force, than could probably be assem-

 bled. It will, therefore, be best to confine the observations simply to the
 determination of corresponding teiuperatures and pressures of the atmo-

sphere. For this purpose nothing more is wanted than a supply of instru-
ments that can be easily used and give accurate results.
58 REPORT--1841.

  --Of the Hygrometer. It is desirable that two hygrometers should be pro-

vided, which may be fixed side by side upon the lid of a box, into which

they may be contrived to pack. The observer should not only note the tem-

perature of the first appearance of dew, but the temperature at which it

again disappears ; and wlaile he is waiting for the last observation by one in-

Astrument, he may proceed to make a new one with the other. store of the

best aether should be provided, and a convenient dropping-bottle. No dis-

advantage would arise from the effect of the diminished pressure upon the boil-

ing-point of the aether, if placed in a bottle contrived for the purpose ; as thus,

      abn, the bottle,

          3I  c d the level of the asther,
              ef a tube fitted tight into the neck, and passing to the bottom of
-r

              ** the liquid, furnished with a stop-cock e. As the atmospheric

        pressure diminished upon the aperture of the stop-cock, the

^^ * pressure of the included vapour would pour out a stream of

aether, which might be regulated, and the rapidity of its subsequent evapora-

tion would be a great advantage ; but as it is probable that the dryness of

some of the upper sections of the atmosphere may be extreme, smaller tubes,

filled with condensed sulphurous acid, should be provided, and kept cool in

ice, by the dropping of which upon the bulb of the hygrometer extreme cold

may be produced. As an additional precaution, a small bright silver capsule

and delicate spirit-thermometer may be prepared, by which the dew-point
may be observed from the direct evaporation of the acid. Bottles containing

a mixture of liquid carbonic acid and aether might perhaps be prepared,

which would answer the purpose still more perfectly. As it is extremely

desirable that the relation of the cold produced by evaporation from the sur-

face of a wet-bulbed thermometer with the dew-point should be ascertained,

and as such an observation would not add much to the trouble of the

observer. Dr. Mason's hygrometer, which is a convenient form of the instru-

ment, may be fixed upon a stem upon the box, immediately behind the

hygrometers, and the temperatures of the two thermometers may be noted.
The freezing of the water in the upper regions will, however, put an end to

these observations. The stem which supports the thermometers may also be
made to carry a moveable card-board, covered on the outside with gilt paper,

--so as to screen all the instruments from direct radiant heat.
   Of the Barometer. The only barometer that can be used, and can be

trusted in observations like those in question, appears to be the Siphon-baro-

meter of Bunten, in Paris (Quay Pelletier, No. 26), or barometers of a
similar construction by Robinson, of London. The tubes of Bunten appear

to be carefully made ; the column of mercury is easily seen ; and the slow
motion of the verniers, though not so fine as in Robinson's, is more easily

managed, a circumstance of some importance in the present instance. The

barometers should be new : their scales divided in millimetres only. Some
of them have a scale of English inches, which, owing to some mistake about

standard temperature, is very erroneous. They should be always kept in-

verted, except when in actual use. When allowed to hang in the position in

which they are used, the mercury in the short tube becomes oxidized, the

glass covered with a powder of the oxide, and the capillary depression con-

siderably increased, which renders the instrument useless. In a cistern-

barometer, where the level of the mercury cannot be observed, the cor-

rections for a change of level for small variations of barometrical pressure

are extremely troublesome. For large changes of barometrical pressure they

must become uncertain in the highest degree. Troughton's mode of deter-

mining the lower level is decidedly bad. The cistern-barometers, in which
          EXPERIMENTS WITH BALLOONS.                                    59

the lower level is determined by contact of a point with the surface of mer-

--cury, are good comparative or differential instruments, but nothing more.
   Of the Thermometer. The best and most convenient thermometers appear

to be those made by Greiner, of Berlin, witli a paper scale enclosed in an

          outer tube, or a scale of milk-white glass. The bulbs are

          exposed, and the scales cannot be injured by immersing the

          bulbs, or whole instrument in water, or any other liquid,

          for purposes of comparison. The graduation should extend
          from --85° Fahr. to about -|- 100° Fahr. In Gay-Lussac's

          ascent, the thermometer descended 40° 25". It is not likely

          that any observers would ascend much higher than he did,

          or that they would undertake an ascent Avhen the tempera-

          ture at the earth's surface was less than 10° C. The ther-

          mometers, during the ascent, should be enclosed in bright

          tin tubes (having an opening through which the scale can

          be observed), open at both ends, with a round disc of tin at

          a little distance from the ends, to prevent the effect of radi-

ation. Thermometers thus protected were used at the Cambridge Observa-
tory, and found to answer well. The temperature of the air being already

known, one thermometer with a wet bulb will be sufficient to determine the

--pressure of vapour at a given station.
   Directions for Observing. When the motion of the balloon in a vertical

direction appears to be small. 1. Observe the thermometer attached to the

barometer. 2. Make the lower edge of the upper ring appear to touch the
upper end of the mercurial column. 3. Make the lower edge of the lower

ring appear to touch the lower end of column. 4. Observe the thermometer
in the tin case for temperature of air, and note the time. 5. Read off the

two verniers of the barometer. 6. Observe the psychometer (wet-bulb ther-

mometer) and Daniell's hygrometer. The observations at the surface of the
earth should be made in the same order. The observers should avoid as

    Report on British Fossil Reptiles. By Richard Owen, Esq.^

                                           Part II.

The British Fossil Reptiles described in the first part of this Report pre-

sented modifications of their osseous structure, and especially of the vertebral
column and locomotive extremities, by -which they were especially adapted
for a marine life, and hence have been collectively termed Enaliosauria.
All the numerous species of this family are extinct, and it seems that the
genera have ceased to be represented since the deposition of the chalk for-
mations. In the present zoological systems the Plesiosauri and Ichthyosauri
are referrible to the Saurian order of reptiles, as defined by Cuvier ; but they
offer the most remarkable deviations from the existing types, and constitute
links which connect the Reptiles, on the one hand, with Fishes, and, on the other
hand, with the cetaceous Mammals.

   The present and concluding part of the Report on British Fossil Reptiles

contains an account of the remains of the Crocodilian, Dinosaurian, Lacer-
tian, Pterodactylian, Chelonian, Ophidian and Batrachian reptiles.

   The most remarkable of the extinct species of the amphibious and terres-
trial Sauria of England have been discovered and described by Dr. Buckland
and Dr. Mantell. Some remains are briefly noticed by Parkinson*, and by
the older English observers, as V/ooller and Chapman. Cuvier has added to
the value of these discoveries by his just observations and comparisons. Some
of the British Chelonian fossils have been noticed by Parkinson, Cuvier and

Dr. Mantell ; but none of the British extinct Ophidians or Batrachians appear
to have been hitherto recognized as such.

                                                Pliosaurus.

   The Enaliosaurs are immediately connected with the Crocodilian reptiles
by an extinct genus, represented by species of gigantic size, of which the
remains are not unfrequent in the Kimmeridge and Oxford clays. The Reptile

in question is essentially a modified Plesiosaurus, but its modifications appear
to entitle it to be regarded as a distinct genus, which, as it is more closely
allied to the true Sauria, I have proposed to call Pliosaurusf.

    Large, simple, conical teeth, with the enamelled crown traversed by well-
defined and abruptly terminated longitudinal or oblique ridges, as in the
teeth of the Plesiosaur, have not unfrequently been discovered in the Kim-
meridge clay formation. These teeth differ from those of the Plesiosaur in
their greater relative thickness as compared with their length, and in the
subtrihedral shape of their crown ; the outer side is slightly convex, sometimes
nearly flat ; it is separated from the two other sides by two sharp ridges ; these
are more convex, and the angle dividing them is often so rounded ofl^ that
they form a demi-cone, and the shape of the tooth thus approximates very

closely to that of the Mosasaur, with which it is equal in size. It may be
readily distinguished, however, even when the crown only is preserved, by

 the ridges which traverse the inner or convex sides, the outer flattened surface
 alone being smooth ; but an entire tooth of the present extinct Reptile presents
 a long fang, which at once removes it from the acrodont group of lacertine

 Saurians, and allies it with the thecodont Reptiles, among which it approaches

 nearest, in the superficial markings of the crown, to the Plesiosaur.

    The known parts of the skeleton of the gigantic extinct reptile, to which the

 teeth in question belong, confirm this approximation ; but the vertebrae of the

neck are so modified, that the peculiarly elongated proportion of this part of the
spine, which characterizes the typical Plesiosaurs, is exchanged for one that

much more nearly approaches the opposite condition of the cervical region

in the Ichthyosaurs. This abrogation of the main characteristic of the Ple-
siosaurs, combined with the more crocodilian proportions of the teeth, esta-
blishes the claims of the Pliosaurus to generic distinction.

    In the collection of Professor Biickland, at Oxford, is preserved a consider-
able proportion of both the upper and lower jaws of a gigantic specimen of

the Pliosaurus, from the Kimmeridge clay formation at Market-Raisin. The

teeth are arranged in separate sockets, in a close and regular series, along the
alveolar borders of the intermaxillary, maxillary and premandibular bones.

Twenty-six sockets may be counted on the most perfect side of the upper jaw;
but the series is evidently incomplete posteriorly. An interspace, not quite

equal to the breadth of a socket, divides the fourth from the fifth tooth, count-
ing backwards, and the jaw is slightly compressed at this interspace ; the four
anterior teeth, thus marked off, occupy the slightly expanded anterior extre-
mity of the upper jaw, but do not present the excessive size of the correspond-
ing teeth in the Plesiosaur. After the fifth tooth the sockets progressively
increase in size to the twelfth tooth, and from the fourteenth they begin gra-
dually to diminish in size, becoming, beyond the twentieth tooth, smaller than

those at the fore part of the jaw.

   The alveolar septa are narrow, and are thinned off to an edge, which is lower

than either the outer or inner walls of the sockets : these walls are equally de-

Aveloped. line drawn transversely across any of the twelve anterior sockets

would be transverse to the jaws, but in the remaining sockets it would incline
obliquely from without, inwards and backwards. The transverse diameter of
the thirteenth socket is one inch six lines ; its antero-posterior diameter is one

inch eight lines.

    The extent of the alveolar series in both jaws is nearly three feet; the

breadth of the palate at the twenty-sixth tooth is nearly one foot ; the breadth
of the upper jaw at the third tooth is four inches and three lines ; the breadth

 of the socket of that tooth is one inch three lines.

    In the lower jaw of the specimen in the Oxford Museum, the posterior ex-

 tremity of the dental series is complete, but not the anterior one ; thirty-five

teeth are present in each premandibular bone. The first, from its large size,

 I conclude to have been received into the slight concavity at the side of the
 upper jaw, where the diastema separates the fourth and fifth teeth ; there are
probably, therefore, thirty-eight teeth on each side of the lower jaw. Counting
 backwards, on this supposition, the teeth begin to diminish in size beyond the
 fifteenth, and at the posterior extremity of the series the sockets are less than
 half an inch in diameter : in their close arrangement and position they corre-
 spond with those of the upper jaw.

    The teeth which are preserved in this magnificent cranial fragment, present
 the characters above defined. The insei-ted fangs of most of these teeth are

 four inches in length ; the entire tooth being thus seven inches in length.

 The ridges which divide the outer from the inner surfaces of the tooth sub-
 side at the base of the crown ; the fang is smooth ; it assumes a subcircular

 form, gradually expands for about half its length, and then contracts to its
 termination ; but this is always less pointed than in the fully formed teeth

 of the true Plesiosaur. In the old teeth with the elongated fang, the pulp
 cavity remains open, as in the Plesiosaurian teeth ; it presents at the expanded

 part of the fang a narrow elliptic transverse section. In a tooth of the present
 species, six inches and a half in length from the Kimmeridge clay at Shotover,

 the diameter of the persistent pulp-cavity was thirteen lines. In this tooth

the flattened surface is polished, but marked with minute shallow wrinkles

one of the ridged surfaces, which stood at right angles to the preceding, was

traversed by eleven well-marked linear ridges of unequal length, separated

by smooth interspaces of about three times the breadth of the ridges ; the

third surface, which formed an acute angle with the smooth outer surface,

was traversed by twelve ridges. These ridges, on the inner surface of the

tooth, slightly inclined towards the rounded angle, dividing the surfaces ; they

terminate abruptly                                                                                some cease half way from the apex of the crown ;                                                                                                             about
                                                                                               ;

ten are continued to within half an inch of the apex, which is smooth ; the

two ridges, which divide the flat or smooth side from the ridged surfaces of

the tooth, are alone continued to the subacute apex of the tooth.

The teeth of the Pliosaur present varieties of form as well as of size ; the

rounding off" of the angle between the ridged surfaces has been already alluded

to ; the smooth outer surface is sometimes so convex, that the transverse

section of the tooth is more elliptical than triangular. All the teeth of the

Pliosaur are slightly bent inwards and backwards                                                                                                                                                                                                          but  the smaller posterior

teeth are most recurved, and have the sharpest apex ; and in the crown of

these teeth the ordinary rounded or elliptical form of the cone is most

nearly attained                                                                but the distinction of the  smooth                                                                                                                                         external surface, and  the
                                                                            ;

ridged internal surfaces of the crown of the tooth are retained, and would

suffice to characterize any of these teeth if found detached.

The teeth consist of a central body of compact dentine, with a coronal

investment of enamel, and a general covering of cement. The dentine is

permeated by fine calcigerous tubes, without admixture of medullary canals.

The arrangement, division, secondary undulations, and branches of the cal-

cigerous tubes closely correspond with those of the teeth of the Plesiosaur.

The germs of the successional teeth in the Pliosaur were developed at the

inner side of the basis of the old teeth, but did not penetrate these teeth ; the

apices of the new teeth make their appearance through foramina situated at

the inner side, and generally at the interspaces of the sockets of the old teeth.

Here, therefore, as perhaps also in the Pterodactyle, the growing teeth may

be included in closed recesses of the osseous substance of the jaw, and

emerge through tracts distinct fi'om the sockets of their predecessors, which

--Ais an exceptional condition of the reproduction of the teeth in reptiles.
Of the Vertebral Column.                                                                          long neck has been considered to be so

peculiarly the distinction of the Plesiosaur, that a species which has this

part of the spine shortened and reduced by the flattening of the vertebrae to

Ichthyosaurian proportions, may be reasonably regarded as at least subgene-

rically distinct, especially when the enormous and massive head, to which the

abbreviated neck bears a subordinate relationship, is armed with teeth which

have just been shown to be as remarkable for their thickness and strength as

those of the Plesiosaurus are for their slender and sharp-pointed proportions.

Perhaps there is no example, save the genus Pliosaurus, in the whole class

of reptiles, living or extinct, which has any of the vertebrae presenting such

proportions as those of the followijig specimen in Dr.Buckland's collection from

the Kimmeridge clay of Foxcombe Hill, near Oxford. The breadth of the

body of this vertebra is six inches ; its depth, or vertical diameter, five inches
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

while in length, or the diameter corresponding with the axis of the body,

it measures only an inch and a half. But cervical vertebrae of similar pro-

portions have been discovered in the Kimmeridge clay near Weymouth, and

were described by Mr. Conybeare in the ' Geological Transactions.' The

Market-Raisin specimen in the Oxford Museum proves that those peculiarly

compressed vertebrae are associated with the well-defined teeth characteristic

of the Oxford and Kimmeridge clays, and with jaws of great size, which could

only be supported and wielded by a neck as short and strong as in the Ceta-

ceous inhabitants of the sea.

The cervical vertebrae, as they recede from the head, increase in breadth

and depth, but retain the same length, as they do throughout the spine in

most Saurians, whatever may be their other dimensions. But in the dorsal

region of the spine of the Pliosaur, the vertebrae acquire a great increase of

length, and there assume the ordinary proportions of Plesiosaurian vertebras :

for example, the first dorsal vertebra of the Market-Raisin specimen, which

is four inches three lines in breadth, and four inches in depth, measures
nearly three inches in length. The posterior dorsal vertebrae slightly in-

crease in depth, and with the same transverse diameter they present a length
of 3 inches 2 lines. The height of one of these vertebrae, including the

spinous process, is 11 inches. These proportions are retained at least to the

Abase of the tail.  vertebra from this part, obtained from St. Giles's gravel-

pit, near Oxford, and probably washed out of the Kimmeridge clay, measures

in length 3 inches ; in the breadth of the body, 4 inches 9 lines ; in the depth

of the same, 4 inches 4 lines.

In the extreme difference which the vertebrae of the neck and those of the

rest of the trunk present in regard to their length, the Pliosaurus forms a

remarkable exception to Saurians in general ; for in the true Enaliosaurs, in

Crocodiles, in Lizards, whatever other modifications the vertebrae may undergo,
or however much they may be expanded in breadth or depth, they maintain

great constancy in the length or antero-posterior diameter of the body. The

Pterodactyles, or flying-lizards, offer another exception to this rule, and the

cervical region is here likewise the seat of the variation ; but whereas in the

Pliosaur the cervical vertebrae are remarkable for their shortness ; in the Pte-

rodactyle they differ from the other vertebrae in their extreme length.

The general structure of the vertebrae of the Pliosaur corresponds closely

with that of the Plesiosaur. The osseous texture is compact at the circum-

ference of the vertebras, and coarsely, but uniformly, cellular in the rest of

the bone. The neurapophyses do not become anchylosed to the centrum,

nor the ribs to the costal processes. The articular surfaces at each end of the

centrum are flat in the cervical, very slightly concave in the dorsal, rather

more concave in the caudal vertebrae. The cervical ribs, judging from their

articulation with the centrum, must have been unusually strong. The rib on

each side of the vertebra was supported on two transverse processes, slightly

raised beyond the level of the centrum, occupying two-thirds of its antero-

posterior extent, and divided by a deep and well-marked linear fissure. In

the anterior cervical vertebrae above described, with a length of 1 inch 9 lines,

and a height of centrum of 3 inches 3 lines, the antero-posterior diameter of the

constant surfaces was 1 inch 2 lines ; their united vertical diameter, 2 inches

2 lines. They occupy a space nearly equi-distant from the upper and lower

surfaces of the centrum. At the base of the neck they begin to rise, as in the

Plesiosaur, upon the neurapophysis, and are supported, in the dorsal region,

upon a single stout transverse process. This is subdepressed, with an oval

transverse section, which is rather sharp at the anterior margin. The spinous

process of the dorsal vertebrae is nearly straight, compressed laterally ; its an-

tero-posterior diameter was 2 inches 8 lines ; in a vertebra, measuring in the

same diameter 3 inches 2 lines, its height from the base of the neurapophysis

was 7 inches. The sides of the centrum are rather rugous near the articular
ends, elsewhere smooth and concave, especially in the dorsal vertebrse. The

lower surface has the two vascular perforations in the cervical regions ; the
vertebrse become slightly contracted towards this part in the dorsal region.

In the caudal vertebrae the costal process is single, vertically elliptical, and
--64 REPORT 1841.
             «

prominent. The non-articular surface of the centrum is not very regular, but

is smooth ; the lower surface is square-shaped, and nearly flat ; its angles are
marked by the haemapophysial surfaces, of which the anterior pair is the

--largest.
   Bones of the Extremities. The type of construction of the bones of the
extremities closely accords with that of the Plesiosaur. The pectoral arch

owes its chief strength to a pair of immensely expanded coracoids, having a
broad and short entosternal bone on their anterior interspace, and supporting

the clavicles, or the acromial productions of the scapulae.

   The femur of the Market-Raisin specimen measures two feet two inches in

--length, and is thirteen inches broad at its distal end a bone well fitted to

support and wield the strong paddle that must have been mainly instrumental

in propelling this carnivorous sea-monster through its native element.

   In another femur, measuring thirteen and a half inches across the distal
end, the circumference of the proximal end was nearly two feet ; the upper
half of the bone is cylindrical ; it gradually exclianges this for a compressed
expanded distal end, which is terminated by a pretty regular convex curve.

The texture of the bone is coarsely cellular throughout, being devoid, as in

other marine Saurians, of any trace of medullary cavity.

One of the siibcircular carpal bones of the Market-Raisin specimen mea-

sured five and a half inches across the broadest part, and four and a half
across the narrowest, and was two and a half inches in thickness.

   The phalanges are short and less compressed than in the Plesiosaurs ; flat
at the articular extremities, and remarkably contracted in the middle.

   Besides the localities affording specimens from which the general descrip-
tion of the bones of the trunk and extremities is taken, and which localities

are noticed in that description, remains of the Pliosaur have been discovered
--Ain the following localities :
                                  small cervical vertebra from Shotover, in

the Oxford Museum ; four dorsal vertebrae, equal in size with the Market-

Raisin specimen, from Marcham, also in the Oxford Museum ; the vertebra

in the Yorkshire Museum*, said to have been found in the gravel of Burn, one

mile below Nunnykirk, Northumberland, and noticed in the first edition of

Lyell's ' Principles of Geology,' is a posterior cervical of a Pliosaurus, and

must be presumed to have been accidentally introduced into that recent de-
posit. The several specimens from these different localities yield strong indi-

cations of two distinct species of the presept gigantic genus, which connects
the Enaliosaurs with the Coelospondylian Crocodiles. The difference in breadth

and height, and especially in the size of the hatchet-bone, or cervical rib, as
indicated by the articular surface, appear to be inexplicable, except on the
supposition of two distinct species. The difference is continued in the dorsal
vertebrae, the transverse processes of which are more compressed, and the non-
articular surface more rugous in the Shotover than in the Market-Raisin spe-
cies. The two forms of femora, on which the species Plesiosauri grandis

and trochanterius are founded in the former part of this Report, are both

referable to the genus Pliosaurus ; but have not as yet been found so asso-

ciated with vertebrae as to aid, in combination with the vertebral characters,

in the definition of the two species. When subsequent discoveries and ob-

servations shall have supplied distinct and recognizable characters to the two

species of the present very remarkable and interesting annectant genus, the

term hrachydeirus, which I had first proposed for the species represented by

of the Kimmeridge clay deposit at Speaton, which measures thirteen inches in length, and

inches in length.

the magnificent remains from Market-Raisin*, would be equally applicable
to the short-necked gigantic Pliosaur from Shotover, and consequently lose its
value as a distinctive appellation.

                               CROCODILIA.

    The remains of species of this order extend from the Eocene tertiary for-
mations as low down as the Oolite and Lias, and offer deviations from the
structure of the existing genera and species, which increase in degree and
amount as the strata containing the extinct species indicate periods more

remote from the present time.

   Not any of the species are identical with those now known to exist, and the
modifications of the' osseous structure, by which the extinct Crocodilians differ
both from the present races and from one another, are much greater than any
of those by which the skeletons of the existing species differ among themselves.
Not only do the form and proportions of the periphei'al parts, as of the jaws, the

teeth, and the locomotive extremities vary, but the spine, or central axis of the
skeleton, offers modifications of the articular surfaces of the component verte-
brae whicli are quite unknown in the Alligators, Crocodiles and Gavials of the
present epoch. In these existing species the anterior surface of the vertebral
centrum is concave, the posterior convex, except in the atlas and sacrum. But
besides this mode of junction, Cuvier has recognized in the Crocodilians of
the secondary formations two other types of vertebral structure : in one of
these the positions of the ball and socket are reversed ; in the other, and more

common modification, both articular surfaces of the vertebra are flat or slightly

concave. Remains of extinct Crocodilians, exhibiting all the three systems
of vertebral articulation, occur in English formations. The extinct species,
which agree with the existing Crocodilians in their vertebral characters, will

be first described.

Crocodiles in Great Britain is the Eocene deposit called th^ London clayf.

A third cervical vertebra from the Isle of Shcppy, is noticed by Cuvier as

being very similar to the corresponding bone in an existing Ci'ocodile, and as

having appertained to an individual of probably five feet in length. No other

part of this Eocene reptile is noticed in the last edition of the ' Ossemens Fos-

land § has figured a smaller but better preserved specimen of the Sheppy

reference to the Crocodilus hiporcatus, or other existing species of Crocodile

or Alligator, are the larger size of the temporal holes as compared with the

orbits, the more regular and rapid diminution of the head towards the snout,
the straight line of the alveolar tract, and the greater relative length and

sienderness of the muzzle, which is evident notwithstanding its imperfect

condition. These differential characters are equally manifest in the larger,

and in some respects more perfect specimen, of the cranium of this species

in the British Museum.

Amongst existing Crocodiles, the Bornean species, called Crocodilus Schle-

(/elii, most resembles the Crocodilus Spenceri. But in the Sheppy Crocodile

the posterior smooth surface of the occiput is less concave ; its upper boun-

dary line is indented in the middle by the termination of a median longitu-

dinal depression upon the upper surface of the skull, which is not present in
the existing species, in which the corresponding surface is flat. The de-

scending process of the basi-occipital, below the articular tubercle, is smoother

--in the Crocodilus Speiiceri ; the interorbital space is flatter : the upper tem-

poral foramina equal the orbits in size a character by which the Crocodilus

Spenceri manifestly approaches the Gavials. The nasal and superior maxil-

lary bones are smoother ; the sloping profile line of the face is straighter, and

the lateral converging lines of the upper jaw are straight. These characters

are well shown in the British Museum specimen.

The upper jaw slightly expands about one-third from its termination, then

contracts, and again expands at the muzzle. At this anterior part the bones

are more pitted than they are nearer the cranium. The alveolar margin

seen in the whole skull is slightly undulating. The jugal bone is slender and

nearly horizontal. The lower jaw has a large elliptical vacuity at its ex-

panded posterior part. Its alveolar risings correspond with the sinkings of

the same part in the upper jaw. In all these characters it corresponds with

the Crocodilus Schlegelii of S. MUUer.

Upon the lower surface of the skull the pterygoids in the Crocodilus

Spenceri are terminated anteriorly by a broader and straighter transverse

line ; from the middle of which the palatines are continued, their posterior

extremities not being expanded, as in the Crocodili vulgaris or hiporcatus,

but of the samei breadth as the rest of the bone. The anterior and internal

curved border of the transverse bones is more regular. The dental series

terminates posteriorly nearer the anterior part of the transverse bone. The

=teeth, If^o  84, are more uniform in size, and more regularly spaced

the intervals, however, vary from 1 1 to 2 and 3 lines ; and that between the
first tooth in Mr. Spencer's mutilated specimen and the second equals 7

lines. The diameter of the base of the crown of the tooth is 3 lines : there

are nine of these teeth in the same extent as that which includes eleven teeth

in a specimen of the Crocodilus vulgaris, having a skull of similar breadth.

The teeth in the Crocodilus Spenceri are subcircular, Avitli an anterior and

posterior longitudinal ridge, with intervening fine longitudinal sti'iae.

The sculpturing of the cranial bones is very similar in the recent and fossil

Crocodiles, but the facial bones are smoother in the Crocodilus Spenceri, as

they likewise seem to be in the Crocodilus Schlegelii.

The following dimensions are taken from the skull of the Crocodilus Spen-

ceri in the British Museum :

   In the museum of Fr. Dixon, Esq., at Worthing, there is a fine fossil, re-

ferable to the Crocodilus Spenceri, from the Eocene clay of Bognor. It
consists of a portion of the skeleton, including the lumbar, sacral, and five
of the caudal vertebras, in a continuous chain of ten inches in length, but
bent in an abrupt curve.

   The vertebras, as compared with those of the Crocodilus acutus, have the
sides of the centrum deeper or more extended vertically, and they are slightly

concave ; the first caudal is, as usual, bi-convex, the under surface is rather

flattened. The femur presents the usual sigmoid curve, it has a well-marked
medullary cavity ; its length is five inches six lines. Mr. Dixon possesses,
from the same locality, a posterior cervical vertebra of a Crocodile, similar in
general characters to those just described, but larger, and probably belong-
ing to an older individual. The length of the body of this vertebra is two
inches and a half.

   Remains of Crocodilians occur in the London clay at Hackney, and in the
Eocene sand-beds at Kyson, in Suffolk ; I have seen from this locality small
bifurcate finely-striated conical teeth, and a small bony scutum, with regular

and pretty deep pits, about the size of pins' heads.

   I next proceed to notice the fossil Crocodiles from the more recent second-
ary formations, and shall commence with those species with biconcave verte-
briB, the remains of Avhich are characteristic of the Wealden beds.

   Amongst the evidences of Crocodilian Reptiles which are scattered through
the Tilgate strata the most common ones are detached teeth, from the differ-

ence observable in the form of which. Dr. Mantell has observed, that " they
appear referable to two kinds ; the one belonging to that division of Croco-

diles with long slender muzzles, named Gavial; the other to a species of Cro-
codile, properly so-called, and resembling a fossil species found at Caen *."

   Dr. Mantell has obligingly communicated to me figures of well-preserved

specimens of both the forms of teeth alluded to, the exactness of which I
have recognized by a comparison with the specimens themselves in the

British Museum.
   The tooth which, from its more slender and acuminated form, approaches

nearest to the character of those of the Gavial, differs from the teeth of any
of the recent species of that sub-genus of Crocodilians, as well as from those

of the long and slender-snouted extinct genera, called Teleosaurus, Steneo-
saurus, &c. I have described this form of tooth fj therefore, as indicative

of a distinct species, under the name of Crocodilus cultnde7is*. The crown

is laterally compressed, subincurved, with two opposite trenchant edges, one
forming the concave, the other the convex outline of the tooth. In the

Gavial, the direction of the flattening of the crown and the situation of the

trenchant edges are the reverse, the compression being from before back-

wards, and the edges being lateralf . The tooth of the Crocodilus cultridens
thus resembles in form that of the Megalosaur, and perhaps still more those
of the Argenton Crocodile ; but I have not observed any specimens of the
Wealden teeth in which the edges of the crown "were serrated, as in both the
reptiles just cited. The teeth of the Crocodilus cultridens also present a
character which does not exist in the teeth of the Megalosaur, and is not at-
tributed by Cuvier:(: to those of the Crocodile d'Argentofi. The sides of
the ci-own are traversed by a few longitudinal parallel ridges, with regular

intervals of about one line in breadth, in a crown of a tooth one inch and a

half in length : these ridges subside before they reach the apex of the tooth,
and sooner at the convex than at the concave side of the crown.

    Hitherto these teeth have not been found associated with any part of the
skeleton of the present extinct Crocodilian; but from the well-marked dif-

ferences between these teeth and those of all other known species, it is most

probable that the extinct Crocodile formed the type of a distinct sub-genus,
for which the term Suchosaurus might be applied.

   In the Wealden strata, biconcave Crocodilian vertebrae have been dis-
covered by Dr. Mantell differing in form from those of the Crocodilian with
obtuse teeth, and readily distinguishable by their compressed and wedge-
shaped body from those of all other known Crocodilians. It is highly pro-
bable that these remarkable vertebrjE are parts of the same animal as the
above described and equally remarkable compressed teeth.

No. 2133, Mantellian Collection, is the body of a dorsal vertebra of this

species of Crocodilian, with both articular extremities slightly and equally

concave : though rather narrower at the middle than at the ends, it is more

uniformly compressed than in other Crocodilian vertebraj, the sides con-

verging to an inferior obtuse ridge, which is very slightly concave in the

antero-posterior direction. The sides are not flat in the vertical direction

nor slightly concave, as in many of the Iguanodoiis vertebras, to which the

present form approximates ; but are gently convex, so that a pencil laid ver-

Atically upon the side touches it only by its middle.  more decided differ-

ence between the present crocodilian vertebras and those of the Iguanodon

is, that the former are longer in proportion to their height and depth. The

external surface at the middle of the body of the vertebra is very finely stri-

ated, so as to present a silky appearance ; near the margins it is sculptured

by coarse longitudinal grooves and ridges.

The base of the neurapophysis, which, when anchylosed, leaves an evident

trace of the suture, is nearly equal in length with the body of the vertebra

it does not wholly include the spinal canal, but leaves the impression of the

lower third of that canal upon the upper surface of the centrum.

of the skeleton of a Telcosaur have hitherto been found in the Wealden. Tlie figures of

^,In No.  Mantellian Collection, the bases of the neurapophysis remain

~.attached to the centrum, which presents the same characters as No.  On

the outside of the neurapophysis are two slightly developed broad obtuse
ridges, converging towards each other from the outer side of each angle or

end of the base of the neurapophysis ; the ridge corresponding with the pos-
terior of these in the Igtianodons vertebra rises more vertically, and is in

higher relief.

   The neurapophysial suture slightly undulates in its horizontal course, and
rises in the middle instead of descending upon the centrum, as in the Ple-

siosaurs.

   The present vertebra is alluded to at p. 70, and figured at pi. ix. fig. 11, of
Dr. Mantell's ' Illustrations of the Geology of Sussex,' as a lumbar vertebra
of the Megalosuurus. But in the ' Geology of the South-east of England,'

the accomplished author, speaking of this vertebra, observes, " It cannot, I

now think, be separated from those figured in the same plate, as belonging

--to a crocodile." p. 297. Fig. 8, pi. ix, (Tilgate Fossils) is, however, a

caudal vertebra of the Cetiosanrus. As I have examined with care the ori-

ginal vertebra of the Megalosuurus, figured after Buckland, and referred to
by Dr. Mantell at pi. xix. fig. 16 of the same work, I can attach the greatest

--confidence to the following difierences : the body of the Megalosaurian

vertebra has a pretty deep longitudinal depression below the neurapophysial
suture, wanting in the Tilgate vertebra here described. This, however, is
not the only distinction ;, below the depression the body of the Megalosaurian
vertebra swells out, and is as convex below as it is laterally in the transverse
direction, so that the outline of a transverse section would describe five-sixths
of a circle: a similar section of No. 123 would be triangular with the apex

rounded off'. The Megalosaurian vertebra is more contracted at the middle,
and swells out near the articular ends, surrounding those articulations with a
thick convex border : in No. 123 the lateral meet the marginal surfaces at a

somewhat acute angle ; but the silky striated surface of the Crocodilian ver-
tebra, and the smooth and polished surface of the Megalosaurian one, would
effectually serve to distinguish even fragments from the middle of the body

of each.

Crocodilian above described :                            No. 123.     No. 138.

   The second form of tooth having the generic characters of those of the
Crocodile, which has been discovered in the Wealden and approximate strata,
is as remarkable for its thick, rounded and obtuse crown as the teeth of the

preceding species are for their slender, compressed, acute and trenchant cha-
racter. It consequently approaches more nearly to the teeth which charac-
terize the broad and comparatively short-snouted Crocodiles ; but it differs
from these in one of the same characters by which the tooth of the Sucho-
saurus cultridens differs from those of the Gavials, viz. in the longitudinal
ridges which traverse the exterior of the crown. These are, however, more
--70 REPORT 1841.

numerous, more close-set, and more neatly defined than in the Suchosaums

cultridens. Two of the ridges, larger and sharper than the rest, traverse

o])posite sides of the tooth, from the base to the apex of the crown; they
are placed, as in the Crocodile and Gavial, at the sides of the crown, mid-

way between the convex and concave lines of the curvature of the tooth.
These ridges are confined to the enamel ; the cement-covered cylindrical
base of the tooth is smooth. The size.of the teeth varies from a length of
crown of two inches, with a basal diameter of one inch and a half to teeth of

one-third of these dimensions.
    Hitherto no teeth of the Goniopholis appear to have been discovered

in the oolite near Caen ; the only specimens resembling them being those
which Cuvier has stated to indicate a second species of Crocodilian, from the

Jura limestone at Soleure*. No other remains referable to this species are

noticed by Cuvier ; but the discovery of a portion of the skeleton, having in
the lower jaw two teeth identical with the obtuse teeth of the Wealden, has

thi'own much light upon the characters of this interesting species.

  --The circumstances connected with this discovery are thus narrated by Dr.

Mantell : " In the summer of 1 837, the workmen employed in a quarry in
the immediate vicinity of Swanage, had occasion to split asunder a large slab
of the Purbeck limestone, when, to' their great astonishment, they perceived
many bones and teeth on the surfaces they had just exposed. As this was

--no ordinary occurrence, for although scales of fishes, shells, &'c. were fre-

--quently observed in the stone, bones had' never before been noticed, both

slabs were carefully preserved by the proprietor of the quarry." They were
obtained by Robert Trotter, Esq., F.G.S., and presented by him to Dr.

Mantell, by whom the bones were relieved from the matrix, so far as their

brittle state would permit. The specimen has subsequently been purchased
by parliament, and, with the rest of Dr. Mantell's collection, is now depo-
sited in the British Museum.

    Figures of this interesting group of bones have been published by Dr.
Mantell in his ' Wonders of Geology,' vol. i. pi. i.; but, excepting the remark
above quoted, with regard to the nearer approach which the fossil makes in
the form of its teeth to the sub-genus Crocodilus, as compared with the more
slender Wealden tooth, no other observation has been published which tends
to establish more precisely and closely the true affinities and nature of the
Swanage Crocodilian.

   The first character which attracts attention is that which the numerous,

large, bony, dermal plates or scutes afford. These are scattered irregularly

over the slab, and in their number and relative size bring the species much

nearer to the extinct Teleosaurs thaii to any of the existing Crocodiles ; they
differ, however, from both the dorsal and ventral scutes of the Teleosaur in
their more regular quadrilateral figure ; they are longer in proportion to their
breadth than most of the Teleosaurian scutes, and are distinguished from
those of all other Crocodilians, recent and fossil, that I have yet seen, by the
presence of a conical, obtuse process, continued from one of the angles verti-
cally to the long axis of the scute, analogous to the peg or tooth of a tile, and
fitting into a depression on the under surface of the opposite angle of the
adjoining scute ; thus serving to bind together the plates of the imbricated

semblable a celle du Crocodile de Caen," I. c. ix. p. 283, pi. ccxxxiv. fig. 8, i. e, the Teleo-
saurus Cadomensis, the teeth of which are " longues, greles, arquees, et tres-pointues, mais
non pas tranchantes." Ibid. p. 271. Cuvier then proceeds to say, " Mais il y en a aussi de
beaucoup plus grosses et plus obtuses, telles que celle de la fig. 7, qui pourraient annoucer
une autre espece." Ibid. p. 283. It is with tliis other species that the blunt-toothed Croco-
dilian of the Wealden and Purbeck limestone bears most resemblance.

bony armour, and repeating a structure which is highly characteristic of the

large bony and enamelled scales of the extinct ganoid genera of fishes, Dape-

dius and Tetragonolepis. Many of the scutes are 6 inches in length and 2^

inches in breadth.

The exterior surface of the scute is impressed, as in the Teleosaur, by

numerous deep, round, or angular pits, from two to four lines in diameter,

and with intervals of about two lines, formed by convex reticularly disposed

ridges of the bone ; but a larger proportion of the anterior part of the scute

is overlapped by the contiguous scute than in the Teleosaur, and this part is
smooth, and thinner than the rest of the scute. The whole of the inner sur-

face of the scute is smooth ; but on a close inspection it is seen to be every-

where impressed by fine straight lines, decussating each other at nearly right

angles, and indicating the structure of the corium in which the scutes were

imbedded. From the size and strength of these dermal bones, their degree
of imbrication, and the structui-e for interlocking, we may conclude that the

Swanage Crocodilian was better mailed than even the extinct Teleosaur, which

Cuvier regarded as " I'espece la mieux cuirassee de tout le genre."

If the detached vertebrse from the Wealden, communicated by Dr. Mantell

to Cuvier, belonged to the obtuse-toothed species and not to the Sitchosaurus

cultridens, it would then have been known that the Swanage Crocodile de-

viated, like the Teleosaur and most extinct Crocodilian species of the secondary

strata, from the Crocodiles, Alligators, and Gavials of the present day, in having

both articular extremities of the body of the vertebra slightly concave.

Cuvier* has associated the obtuse teeth with this form of vertebra without

hesitation ; but it must be admitted that there was room for some doubt, two
distinct species, at least, having been indicated by the fossil teeth.

In the slabs between which the remains of the Swanage Crocodile are di-

vided, the vertebrai were unfortunately all at right angles to their plane, and are

fractured across the middle, one extremity being buried in one of the halves

of the slab, and the other in the opposite half. By permission of the Trus-

tees of the British Museum, and the kind aid of the distinguished Mineralo-

gist at the head of the Geological Department, this doubt has been solved

since the reading of the present Report at Plymouth. The limestone has

been carefully removed from the two extremities of the same vertebra, and

both are equally but slightly concave.                                In. Lines.

vertebra expands in a greater degree to form the snbconcave articular sur-

faces than in other biconcave vertebrse of the same length ; and both in this
character, in its smooth surface, and circular transverse contour at the lower

part, the Goniopholis resembles the Streptospondylus more than it does the

Teleosaums.

The medullary canal, at the middle of these vertebrae, presents in trans-

verse section the form of an inverted triangle, the apex sinking into the body

of the vertebra. The transverse processes of the lumbar and anterior caudal

vertebrae are long, straight, and comparatively slender ; those of the sacral

vertebrae arc relatively thicker, and the spaces inclosed by their expanded ex-

tremities are smaller than in either the Teleosaurs or true Crocodiles. The

antero-posterior extent of the two sacral vertebrae is three inches two lines.
   The ilium is broader than in the existing Crocodilians ; the bifurcation of

the proximal end of the ischium is more marked, and the iliac branch is more

regularly rounded ; the pubic branch is longer, more slender, and its articular

end is more regularly convex                                                                                                                         the distal or lower part of the ischium expands

into a relatively broader plate. This character is still more conspicuous in

the pubis, M'hich equals the ischium in breadth, and begins to expand much

nearer the proximal extremity than in the existing Crocodiles. In these

modifications of the pelvis, as well as in the biconcave structure of the ver-

tebra, the Crocodilian of the Purbeck limestone approaches nearer to the

characters of the Enaliosaurs ; and we may infer that its habits were more

decidedly marine than are those of existing Crocodilians. The caudal verte-

brae were provided Avith long, narrow, unanchylosed chevron bones.

   The portion of the lower jaw preserved belongs to that part of the left ramus

included between the articular extremity, which is broken off, and the com-
mencement of the dental series ; it measures one foot six inches in length, and
five inches in greatest depth. In these proi^ortions, and the curve of the lower
margin, it deviates from the ancient Teleosaurs and Steneosaurs, and resembles
the modern Crocodiles ; and although not quite equalling these in the robust

proportions of the jaws, yet it much exceeds in this respect the Crocodilians
with more slender teetli. What the i-eal length and form of the jaws may
have been, and how nearly they may have approached the Gavial type, there

is not at present means to determine. Sufficient, however, has been pointed
out from the remains which are at present discovered, to show that the Swanage

Crocodilian differs from the existing subgenera of Crocodilians in a greater

degree than these do from one another; that in the form of its vertebrae and

the structure of the dermal armour, it is much more nearly allied to the

Teleosauri and other Crocodilian genera of the biconcave vertebral system
and that, in this ancient and extinct group of Crocodilians, it typifies the

Alligator family of the Crocodilians of the ball-and-socket vertebral sj'stem.

   I propose to name the subgenus indicated by the known remains of the
Swanage Crocodile, Goniopholis, in reference to the rectangular form, size,

number, and firm junction of the osseous scutes (cjioXiSes), with the specific
name of " crassidens."

In a collection of fossil Saurian remains from the Hastings beds in the

possession of Gilpin Gorst, Esq., F.G.S., is the base of the tooth of the Go-

niopholis crassidens, eight lines in diameter.

   Remains of Crocodilians are stated by Dr. Mantell to have been found,
though very rarely, in the lower chalk, and in the grey chalk at Dover*.

characterized by a combination of a biconcave structure of the vertebrag, with
long, narrow jaws, armed with slender, conical, sharp-pointed and equal teeth,
adapted, liiie those of the existing Gavials, for the seizure and destruction
of lishes. The species are separated into two genera, according to the
difference of position in the external nostril, which, in the one called Teleo-
suMviis, is terminal, or at the extremity of the upper jaw; in the other,
called Steneosaurus, is a little behind and above the termination of the

upper jaw. The species of both genera are confined to the oolitic division
of the secondary rocks, and, since there were scarcely any Mammalia during

that period, whilst the waters were abundantly stored with fishes, it might, a

priori, have been expected, Dr, Buckland justly observes, "that if any Cro-

codilian forms had then existed, they would most nearly have resembled the

modern Gavial*." The modification in tlte structure of the vertebral column,

and their complete mail of imbricated bony scutes, also indicate that the

habits of the ancient Teleosauri and Steneosauri were more strictly marine

than are those of the modern Gavials, and that their powers of swimming, of

pursuing and overtaking their aquatic prey, were greater.

The extinct reptile from which the characters of the genus Telcosaurus

are derived, is one of the earliest of the evidences of ancient Reptilia which

Ais recorded in a scientific publication.  brief description, and figures of an

incomplete skeleton found in the lias (alum schale) of the Yorkshire coast,

about half a mile from Whitby, were published by Messrs. Wooller and

Chapman, in two separate communications, in the 50th volume of the Philo-

sophical Transactions, 1758, (Pt. 2, jil. xxii. and xxx.). Their figures ex-
hibit a contorted and incomplete vertebral column, about nine feet long, and

a cranium slightly displaced, two feet nine inches in length. About ten ver-

tebrae of the lumbar and sacral region of the trunk, and twelve vertebrae of

the tail remain in place ; the cervical, dorsal, and middle coccygeal vertebrae
were indicated only by their impressions ; and these are fewer in number

than the vertebrae in the existing Crocodiles. The skull is reversed, pre-

senting its basal surface to view : the single occipital condyle, the zygomatic

arches, terminated behind by the strong tympanic bones, and the lai'ge convex

articular surface in each of these, for the lower jaw, placed in the same trans-

verse line as the occipital condyle, are all recognizable. The skull appears to

contract gradually to a pointed muzzle, but in reality to the base of a long

and slender maxillary beak. In the remaining basal or posterior portions of

the jaws, the sockets of the teeth are seen separated by intervals of about

nine lines ; in some of these there are pointed conical teeth, which cross al-
ternately those of the opposite jaw. The teeth are covered with polished

enamel f.
   Each of the vertebrae is three inches in length. Near the pelvic region, the

.shaft of the femur, including the head, was exposed, measuring between

Athree and four inches in length.  few fragments of ribs were found near

the dorsal vertebrae. The authors of the papers just analysed perceived suf-

ficient resemblance between their fossil and the skeleton of the Crocodile to

refer it to that family of reptiles + ; but their figures and descriptions gave rise
to various opinions respecting the affinities of the Whitby fossil in the writings

Wooller thinks that " it resembles in every respect the Gangetic Gavial." It will be shown,

however, that the fossil really differs more from the Gavial than the Gavial does from any

 of subsequent naturalists and anatomists. Camper, for example, pronounced
 it to be a whale, perhaps meaning a dolphin, foi-, as Cuvier remarks, the pre-
 sence of teeth in both jaws at once proves the fossil not to belong to the
 Balsenas, which have no teeth, nor to the Physeters, which have (conspicuous)
 teeth only in the lower jaw. Faujas adopted Camper's opinion, referring the
 fossil to the genus Physeter, and adding some reasons which are contradicted

 by the descriptions given by both Chapman and WooUer. Cuvier, in the first

 edition of his ' Ossemens Fossiles,' after refuting the opinion of Faujas, says,

 " La verite, ainsi que nous le verrons, est que c'etoit reellement un crocodile."
 The subsequent analysis, to which Cuvier here refers, led him in 1812 to

 the conclusion that it belonged to the genus of Crocodiles, and was most pro-
 bably identical in species with the Crocodile of Honfleur.

    In 1836, however, when so many new and singular genera, allied to the

 Crocodilian family, had been added to the catalogues of Paleontology,
 chiefly by the labours and discoveries of English anatomists and geologists,

 Cuvier expresses his opinion on the fossil described by Wooller and Chapman

with more caution. He says, " II reste maintenant a savoir si c'est un croco-

dile, ou I'un de ces nouveaux genres decouverts dans les memos bancs. Les

OS des extremites y sont trop incomplets, et la tete n'y est pas represente

avec assez de details pour decider la question ; mais les vertebres me parais-

sent plus longues, relativement a leur diametre, que dans les nouveaux genres,
et plus semblables par ce caractere a celles des Crocodiles. Ceux qui retrou-
veront I'original, s'il existe encore, pourront seuls nous apprendre si les autres
caracteres repondent a celui-la."

    I have made inquiry at the British Museum, to Avhich the collections

formerly belonging to the Royal Society were transferred, but no specimen
corresponding with the account and figures given by the Whitby naturalists

exists in that collection.

   A second specimen of a long and slender-nosed Crocodilian, was obtained

from the lias near Whitby, between Staiths and Runswick, in the year 1791*;
and a more perfect skeleton was discovered in the alum shale of the lias for-
mation at Saltwick, near Whitby, in 1824. Both these specimens so closely
resemble the older fossil in all the points in which a comparison can be esta-
blished, as to dissipate the remaining doubts as to the nature and affinities of
the specimen from the same locality, described in the Philosophical Trans-

actions for 1758. The skeleton, discovered in 1824, is figured in Young and
Bird's 'Geological Survey of the Yorkshire Coast', 2nd edit. 1828, pi. xvi.

fig. 1. p. 287, and in Dr. Buckland's ' Bridgewater Treatise,' vol. ii. pi. xxv.

It is now preserved in the museum at Whitby, where I have closely exa-

mined it. In this specimen are preserved the cranium, wanting the snout, the
whole vertebral column, the ribs, and the principal parts of the four extremi-
ties, together with the dorsal, and part of the ventral series of dermal bones.
The entire length of the skeleton, following the curvature of the spine, is

fifteen feet six inches, to which may be added two feet six inches for the lost
snout. The cranium posteriorly is broad, depressed, and square-shaped : it

begins to contract anterior to the orbits, and gradually assumes the form of
the narrow depressed snout ; the converging sides of the maxillae are concave
outwardly. The zygomatic spaces are quadrilateral, longer in the axis of
the skull than transversely ; the orbits are subcircular ; they look upwards
and slightly outwards ; their margins are not raised, and their interspace is
slightly concave. The parietal bone is relatively longer than in the Gavial,
.and sends up a longitudinal median crest, from the posterior part of which

a strong process extends on each side outwards, and curves slightly backwards
parallel with the ex-occipitals, to join the mastoid and tympanic bones, the
latter of which expands as it descends to form the joint for the lower jaw.

From these dimensions it may be calculated that the entire length of the skull

must have exceeded 4 feet 6 inches.

   The skull of one of the Caen Teleosauri measures 3 feet 4 inches, whence
Cuvier calculates the entire length of the animal at near 15 feet. The Whitby

Teleosaur agrees with the Caen species, and differs from the Gavial in the

following particulars :  the anterior frontal is less extended  upon  the  cheek
                                                                                                      ;

the lachrymal is much more extended, and is larger at its base; the jugal

bone is more slender. The posterior fi'ontal, which separates the temporal
from the orbital cavities, is much longer and narrower. The parietal and oc-

cipital crests each form a thin trenchant plate, and are not flattened above.

The mastoidean angle is not uninterruptedly united with the back part of

the articular process of the tympanic, it is separated from it by a large de-

pression, which is overarched by a trenchant crest belonging to the ex-occi-

pital. The mastoidean bone has a concavity at its descending part, of which

there is no trace in the Gavial. The indentation between the articular pro-
cess of the tympanic, and the tuberosity of the basi-occipital is much smaller

than in the Gavial, and the basilar tuberosity projects downwards in a less

degree. The pterygoid ala is not expanded externally, as in all Crocodiles,

but is contracted by a large fissure, at the part where it goes to unite itself

to the bone ; the orbital margin of the malar is not raised, and does not leave
behind it a deep fissure as in the Gavial. The malar does not rise to join the

posterior frontal bone; but, on the contrary, the frontal descends to join the

malar at the external margin of the orbit. The vacuity between the orbit and

the anterior part of the tympanum is much elongated in the fossil, and occu-

pies four-fifths of the temporal fossa ; the anterior part of this fossa is narrow

and acute. The columella or ossicle of the ear is cylindrical, and much larger

in proportion than in any known Crocodile or other reptile.

Cuvier calculates the number of teeth in the Teleosaurus Cadomensis to be

180, viz. '-f^.

   The Teleosaurus Chcqmmnni has at least 140 teeth.

   The Gavial has 112, or ^|5ii-
   The teeth of the Whitby Teleosaur are as slender and sharp-pointed, but
not so compressed, as in the Gavial ; they correspond with those of the Caen

Teleosaur, and equally illustrate the dental characters usually attributed to
the present extinct genus*.

Monheim Teleosaur*, in having the upper temporal fossae longer in propor-
tion to their breadth ; but it differs from the Teleosaurs of both Caen and
Monheim in the more equal size of the teeth, and from the Monheim species
in the greater number of teeth, the Teleosaurus prisons having at most

=2g_2() 106. The median frontal in the Wliitby Teleosaur is slightly con-

cave : in the Caen species it is flat. Tlie basi-occipital is perforated by the

common terminal canal of the Eustachian tube close to the junction with the

sphenoid, and, on eacli side of the hole, it expands into a rough tuberosity.

The body of the sphenoid is compressed, characterized by tM'o processes or
narrow ridges, continued one from each side of the middle of the sphenoid
obliquely backwards. The pterygoid bones are relatively smaller than in the
Gavial. The palatine bones are more extended posteriorly, and articulate
with the transverse bones. The posterior apertures of the nasal canals are

--placed more forwards upon the base of the skull than in existing Crocodiles.
    Vertebral Column. The number of vertebraj in the true Crocodiles of the
present period rarely exceeds sixty, which is the number originally assigned
by iElian-j- to the spinal column of the Crocodile of the Nile. Cuvier gene-
rally found 7 cervical, 12 dorsal, 5 lumbar, 2 sacral, and 34 caudal vertebraj.

    In the Crocodilus acutits a thirteenth pair of ribs is occasionally developed,
and, according to Plumier, it has two additional caudal vertebrae.

   The Alligator (^Alligator Lticius) has sixty-eight vertebrae, the additional

ones being in the caudal region.

 --The Gavial has sixty-seven vertebrae, disposed as follows: 7 cervical, 13

dorsal, 4 lumbar, 2 sacral, and 41 caudal vertebrae.

   The very perfect specimen in the Whitby Museum displays the number

of the vertebrae through the whole spinal column, and establishes another
difference between the Teleosaur and the Gavial, the former having a num-
ber of vertebra intermediate between the Crocodiles and Gavials, viz. 64,
with a special peculiarity in the excess of costal vertebrae, as the following
formula indicates, viz. 7 cervical, 16 dorsal, 3 lumbar, 2 sacral, 36 caudal.

    In all sub-genera of existing Crocodiles, as in the extinct tertiary species,
the hind surface of the vertebra is convex, the fore surface concave, except
in the atlas and the two sacral vertebrae.

   Cuvier, wlio had the opportunity of seeing only the annular part (neura-
pophyses) of the cervical vertebrae of the Caen Teleosaur, regrets his in-
ability to state Avhether either of the articular extremities of the centrum
were convex, or which of them %. The Whitby Teleosaur decides this ques-
tion, and shows that both articular extremities of the vertebrae are slightly
concave in the cervical as in the rest of the vertebral series.

   The atlas in the Teleosaur corresponds essentially with that of the Croco-
diles, as is shown by the three main component parts of this bone, from a
Whitby Teleosaur in Lord Enniskillen's collection. The body or centrum

is a transverse quadrilateral piece, smooth and convex below, narrowing like
an inverted wedge above, with six articular facets, viz. a concavity in front
for the occipital condyle, a flat rougher surface on each side of the upper
parte for the attachment of the neurapophyses ; a posterior facet for the an-
terior part of the detached odontoid element of the axis ; and the small sur-

face on each lateral, posterior and inferior angle for the atlantal ribs. The

neurapophyses are pyramidal processes, with their apices curved towards
each other ; they are relatively smaller in proportion to the centrum than in
the Crocodiles.

   The general anterior concavity for the reception of the occipital tubercle
is formed at its circumference by the centrum and neurapophyses of the
atlas, and at its middle by the anterior detached odontoid epiphysis of the
axis, which is here evidently the analogue of the so-called atlas in the Ich-
thyosaurus, the true body of the atlas in the Teleosaur representing the first
inverted wedge-shaped bone in the Ichthyosaur. The spine of the atlas is

a large strong oblong piece, articulated with the neurapophyses of the atlas,

and partly overlapping those of the axis.
   The cervical vertebrae have strong transverse processes developed one

from each side of the centrum, and one from the base of each neurapophysis.

The posterior articular processes look obliquely downwards and outwards,
the anterior ones obliquely upwards and inwards. The spinous process is

compressed, its base coequal with the whole antero-posterior extent of the
neurapophysis ; its height equal to the distance from its base to the upper
transverse process; it inclines slightly backwards, and is slightly rounded

off at the summit. The cervical rib is bifurcate at its vertebral end, the
tubercle being as long as the head and neck ; its distal end is expanded into
the hatchet shape, the posterior angle being most produced, and overlap-
ping the costal process of the next vertebra behind. The same mechanism

for fixing and strengthening the neck thus existed for the advantage of the

ancient marine Crocodiles, as we find in those of the existing epoch.

    In the dorsal region the ribs exchange the hatchet for the ordinary length-
ened form, and soon begin to lose the head and neck, as in existing Croco-
diles ; after the fifth they no longer articulate with the central element, but
only to the transverse process of the neurapophysis, which increases in antero-
posterior extent and thickness, and pi-esents an oblique notch at its anterior

angle, for the reception of the tubercle, now the only head of the rib. The
number of the dorsal ribs exceeds that of any existing Crocodilian, being,
as above indicated, 16 pairs. The spinous process is proportionally strong ;
in the Whitby specimen it measures in most of the dorsal vertebrae 2 inches

in antero-posterior extent, and seven lines in transverse diameter or thick-

ness : the height of these spines seems not to have much exceeded that of
the cervical spines, but they are more truncated at the summit.

  A posterior dorsal or lumbar vertebra of a Teleosaur from the Whitby lias,

in the collection of Mr. Ripley, corresponds with the vertebral characters of

Telcosaurus in the slight concavity and circular contour of the terminal arti-
cular surfaces of the body, and in the great antero-posterior extent of the
spinous processes ; but that of the transverse process does not exceed one-

half the length of the body of the vertebra, which is 2 inches 6 lines. The

transverse process is supported by two short obtuse slightly-developed ridges,
which rise from the upper part of the side of the body, as far apart as to
include one-third of the length of the body between them, and converge to
the under part of tlie transverse process ; a similar ridge extends from the
upper part of the posterior end of the transverse process obliquely backwards
to the base of the posterior articular process. The neural arch is anchylosed
to the centrum in this vertebra. The supporting buttresses of the transverse
processes are not described by Cuvier in the dorsal vertebra; of the Ca<?n
Teleosaur ; nor have I met with any dorsal or lumbar vertebras of the Whitby
species, except the present, that was sufficiently perfect to exhibit tiiis cha-
racter; it may, however, be constant and characteristic of the genus. It
faintly indicates one of the most striking characters of the vertebrje of the
Slreptospondylus. The anterior and posterior margins of the spinous pro-
cess are slightly excavated, and thus retain a character which is transitory in

the Crocodile, and peculiar to an early period of its existence.
78 REPORT 1841.

The transverse processes of the two sacral vertebrae are tliick, strong and

expanded at their extremities.

The bodies of all the vertebrce are compressed laterally, and concave antero-

posteriorly at the sides ; but this character is more strongly marked in the

anterior caudal vertebrae, which are flattened along the inferior surface ; these
vertebrae in the Whitby specimen were 2 inches 8 lines in length. The

transverse processes are longer, but narrower antero-posteriorly than in the

lumbar or dorsal vertebrae. The haemapophyses are united at their peripheral

end, forming chevron bones, but are detached at their central ends, which

are articulated, as in recent Crocodiles, with the interspaces of the vertebral

centres. The caudal vertebrae progressively diminish in every diameter,

save length, from the middle to near the end of the tail ; the terminal vei'tebrse

are shorter than the rest.

The sternum and sternal ribs closely agree with the ordinary Crocodilian

--type. I have not yet seen a specimen of the abdominal sternal ribs.
   Pectoral extremities. The scapula and coracoid resemble, in general form,

those of the Crocodile, but are relatively smaller, in correspondence with the

smaller size of the anterior extremities. The scajjula, for example, is only

one-third  the  length  of the femur;  it  is  straighter  than  that of  the  Crocodile
                                                                                                                          ;

both margins are nearly equally concave, instead of the anterior one being

convex : the humeral end is less expanded, and is more obliquely truncated.

The coracoid is longer than the scapula, instead of being, as in the Crocodiles,

shorter : this probably depends upon the breadth of the fore part of the body,

which regulates the extent of the coracoid, while the proportions of the

scapula more exclusively depend upon the development of the pectoral ex-

tremity. The coracoid of the Teleosaur differs also from that of the Croco-

dile in the greater expansion of its humeral end, the more transvei'se position

of its sternal convex extremity, and a nearer approach to parallelism in the

direction of the two lateral margins.

In the Whitby Teleosaur, discovered in 1824, the humerus of the right

anterior extremity, and the humerus and bones of the fore-arm of the left

are preserved nearly in their proper relative positions. The humerus is

shorter in proportion than in the Crocodiles, its length scarcely exceeds the

antero-posterior diameter of two of the cervical vertebrae. The antibrachial

bones are still more curtailed in their proportions ; the longest bone, or ulna,

being not quite half the length of the humerus.

No portions of the carpal or other bones of the paddle are preserved, but

the presence of the antibrachial bones, distinct from each other, and of the

ordinary form and breadth at the distal end, forbid our supposing them to

have been naturally deficient or of abortive proportions in the Teleosaurus.

The humerus, radius and ulna must have existed for a purpose, and that pur-

pose, we may conclude, from the modifications for an aquatic life in the rest

of the skeleton, to have been the support and movement of a palmated manus

an organ which would be of great use in turning and regulating the course

of the swimmer, and in bringing the long and slender snout, with the terminal

nostrils, to the surface. The fore-paddles were doubtless much smaller than

in ordinary Crocodiles, and this difference of proportion related both to the

less frequent resorting of the Teleosaur to dry land, and to the light and

slender character of its jaws and teeth, and the consequent diminution of the

--weight of its head.
   Pelvic extremity. The pelvis of the Teleosaur was attached, as in the

Crocodile, to the thickened and expanded transverse processes of two sacral

vertebrae. These processes are stronger in the vertical direction, and inter-

cept a relatively smaller and more regularly elliptical space than in the exist-

ing Crocodiles ; the anterior one appears not to have been so much expanded
in the antero-posterior direction. The iliac bone seems to have been shorter

in the antero-posterior diameter, but longer, as measured transversely to the

axis of the trunk, and thus to have made a slight approach to its character-

istic form in the Enaliosaurs.

   Both the ischium and pubis are relatively more expanded than in the
Gavial. The pelvic extremities are preserved in the Whitby specimen in

nearly their true relative positions ; but the right is thrown directly over the
left. The femur presents the usual Crocodilian form., but is relatively more

slender than in the existing Crocodilians ; it is slightly twisted, and bent in

two directions. Its proximal end is expanded, compressed with a regular
convex curve, describing a semicircle ; the trochanter is represented by a ridge

which gradually subsides, and is lost upon the surface of the shaft. This is

nearly cylindrical at the upper part, but is produced at the anterior or convex

side along the distal half in the form of an obtuse ridge. The condyles are

very feebly indicated. In the Whitby specimen of 1824,

....The diameter of middle of shaft

Both the tibia and fibula are subcompressed towards their distal end : the

length of each bone is 8 inches. The shaft of the fibula is nearly as thick

as that of the tibia. The bones of the leg of the Teleosauriis resemble

those of the Aelodon in their relative shortness as compared with the femur.

In these, and probably in other ancient Crocodiles with biconcave vertebrae

and marine habits, the tibia is little more than half the length of the femur

while in recent Gavials it is two-thirds that length. There are five tarsal

bones, two in the proximal and three in the distal row, as in the Gavial ; but

they are of more equal size ; the two proximal bones being by no means so

disproportionately large. All the long bones have distinct medullary cavities,

and these are even present in the metatarsals. In the Whitby specimen,

...The length of the middle metatarsal is                  . 6 inches.

The breadth of its proximal end                            10 lines.

The breadth of its distal end                              6 lines.

The ungual phalanges are depressed, smooth and convex above, rounded at

the end.

  --Dermal armour. The bony dermal scutes of the Teleosaur were regularly

disposed like those of existing Crocodiles, in both longitudinal and transverse
series ; the posterior margin of one scute covered the base of the succeed-
ing scute *, and they slightly overlapped each other laterally.

    Cuvier states that one of the fossils of the Teleosauriis Cadomensis presents
all those of one side in their natural situation, exhibiting, in the part of the
body included between the first dorsal and the beginning of the tail, fifteen
or sixteen transverse rows, containing five scutes on each side ; so that there
were at least ten longitudinal rows of these dermal bones.

   The scutes are arranged in the same manner and number, at least as regards
the transverse rows, in the Whitby Teleosaur ; these rows being indicated by

the large dorsal scutes still occupying their natural position in an uninter-
rupted line along the back ; they are twenty in number, and sixteen cover
the vertebrae included between the last cervical and first caudal.

   The scutes of the Teleosaurus Chapmanni differ as much from those of the

existing Gavials and Crocodiles, as do those of the Teleosaurus Cadomensis,

                                * Cuv., /. c. p. 279.

being thicker, rectangular, and having the outer surface impressed with cir-
 cular pits or indentations from three to four lines in diameter, which are not
 confluent, but separated.

    The median dorsal scutes of the Whitby specimen are nearly square,
having the longer diameter, about three inches and a half across, placed trans-

verse to the axis of the body, and with the outer margin slightly rounded.
Each of these scutes is traversed, as in the Teleosaurus priscus, by a longi-

tudinal ridge, which is less developed than in the Gavials. The median dor-

sal scutes of the Teleosauri Cadomensis and priscus appear to differ from
those of the Teleosaurus Chapmanni in being more oblong transversely, and
with the posterior and lateral margins rounded off. Cuvier does-pot allude
to the cai'inated character of these plates in the Caen species.

    The lateral and ventral scutes of the Teleosaurus Chapmanni are more per.r-

feet squares than those next the spine, but differ less in form and size fro.m
them, than in the Caen Teleosaur. They are marked externally by the same
impressed pattern, but are not carinated. The median abdominal scutes are
not opposite but alternate ; their median margins are rounded ofl^, or slightly
angular ; and, while the anterior part of that margin is overlapped by the
posterior half of the opposite scute, in advance, the posterior half overlaps

the succeeding scutum of the opposite side. The verticillate cuirass of these
ancient Crocodiles is thus securely braced round the trunk by this inter-

locking of the inferior extremities of each ring of scutes, whilst the imbri-
cated arrangement would allow of a certain sliding motion of the rings upon

each other sufficient for the expansion qf the chest in breathing. The scutes

in the fine specimen in the Whitby Museum measure about five lines in

thickness, but are thinned off at the edge.

   Having now detailed the anatomical particulars which a study of the mag-
nificent and unique skeleton of the Teleosaurus, in the museum at Whitby,
has enabled me to add to the previous descriptions, by Cuvier and other ana-

tomists, of the osteological structure of this extinct Crocodilian genus, I next
proceed to notice the principal examples of the same genus which are preserved

in other collections of British Fossil Reptiles.

   The first of these is a fine skull of the same species of Teleosaurus, and
from the same lias beds near Whitby, in the museum of Mr. Ripley of that
town :

The length of the entire skull is                         Feet. Inches.

The extremity of the upper jaw well exhibits in this specimen the charac-

teristic generic modification of its infundibuliform expansion, supporting the
terminal nostrils, and resembling the extremity of the elephant's proboscis,
wanting the digital process.

   This cranium also clearly exhibits the specific charactei's by which the
Teleosaurus Chapmanni of the Yorkshire lias differs from the Teleosaums
Cadomensis of the Caen oolite, viz. the greater antero-posterior extent of the
upper temporal openings as compared with their transverse diameter in the
Teleosaurus Chapmanni; the similar but slighter difference in the form of
the orbits, the greater breadth of tiie interorbital space, which slightly ex-
ceeds the transverse diameter of the orbit instead of falling short of that
diameter, as in the Teleosaurus Cadomensis.
                    ON BRITISH FOSSIL REPTILES.                       81

A cranium of the Teleosaurus Chapmanni, in the museum of the Philo-

sophical Institution at York, and another in the museum at Scarborough,

offer the same specific characters as the Whitby specimens. In the Scar-

borough cranium the diameter of the orbit is 2 inches 3 lines, while that of

the interorbital space is 2 inches 6 lines.

   In the museum of the Natural History Society at Lancaster there is a chain

of five dorsal vertebrae of the Teleosaurus Chapmanni, from the Whitby lias,

Ameasuring 1 foot in length ; each vertebra is 2 inches 4 lines in length. sec-

tion of these vertebrae showed a small cavity in the centre of the cancellous

structure of the body*.

  --Teleosaurus Cadomensis. Specimens of fragments of the jaw, teeth and

vertebrae of this species have been discovered in the Bath oolite at Enslow,

near Woodstock, and in the oolite at Stouesfield.

  --Teleosaurus Cadomensis (var.). Of this species, which is nearly allied to,

if not identical with Cadomensis, I have examined a posterior cervical ver-

tebra from the oolite near Chipping Norton, now in the collection of Mr.

Kingdon of that town. The sides of the centrum are less compressed than in

the Teleosaurus Chapmanni, and the articular extremities have a more cir-

cular contour, the transverse exceeding the vertical diameter. There is no

appearance of a ridge along the under surface : the transverse process of the

centrum arises close to the neurapophysis.

        The length of this vertebra is      Inch. Lines.

--Teleosaurus asthenodeirus. Nob. If the cranium of this Saurian should

correspond with the characters of the genus Teleosaurus which are exhibited

by the vertebrae and scutes here described, a distinct species of this genus is

very evidently indicated by them, characterized by the smaller size of the

cervical ribs, and the consequently weaker structure of the neck.

   In the Oxford Museum are preserved two cervical vertebree and a dermal

bone of this species, from the Kimmeridge clay at Shotover. The articular

extremities and general form of the body of the vertebrae accord with the

Teleosaurian type.

The length of the centrum is                          Inches. Lines.

   This process arises near the lower surface of the centrum, about half an
inch from the anterior extremity of the bone. It is separated about the same
distance from the upper transverse process, which is continued from the base
of the neurapophysis ; both the supports of the cervical rib are one-third
smaller than the corresponding processes in the Teleosauri Chapmanni and
Cadomensis, and are less extended from the sides of the vertebra.

   The dermal scute is devoid of a ridge ; one-half of the external surface is

pitted with well-defined hemispherical depressions, separated from each other
by about half their breadth, the smallest being nearest the margin : the other
half of the scute is smooth, and indicates that it was overlapped by the ad-

joining scute, according to the characteristic disposition of this fish-like

covering of the present extinct marine genus of Crocodilians.

    In the Hunterian Collection are two entire dorsal vertebrae, with part of a
third, fractured through the middle of the body, and displaying a small can-
cellated cavity tilled with calcareous spar, as in the Teleosaurus Chapmanni.
These vertebrae present the slightly concave articular extremities, and the
other characters of the genus Teleosaurus. The length of the centrum,
measured along the under surface, is 2 inches 6 lines; vertical diameter of
articular end 2 inches; transverse diameter 1 inch 10 lines; transverse dia-
meter of the middle of the body 1 inch. Both the inferior and lateral sur-
faces of the body are regularly concave, lengthwise ; and smooth, except
near the expanded articular extremities, where they are striated in the axis of

the vertebra.

   The antero-posterior extent of the transverse process is 1 inch 6 lines
that of the base of the spinous process 1 inch 9 lines. The transverse dia-

meter of the spinal canal 7 lines ; its vertical diameter ^\ lines.
    These vertebra are cemented together by a matrix, which closely resem-

bles the gray Kimmeiidge clay : and a portion of a species of Pecten is at-
tached, which is one of the characteristic fossils of the oolite group of secondaiy
rocks, especially the Oxford clay.

                           Steneosaurus.

                           Steneosaurus rostro-minor, Geoffroy.

The generic name Steneosaurus, proposed by Geoffroy St. Hilaire for

the Gavial-like Crocodilians with subterminal nostrils, but applied by him to

species with vertebrae of two distinct systems, and altogether rejecte'd by M.
Hermann von Meyer, I propose to retain for that section of the Geoffroyan

genus, including the species with vertebrae subconcave at both extremities, as

in the genus Teleosaurus.

Remains of the genus Steneosaurus, thus defined, occur in the Kimme-

ridge clay at Shotover, and in the great or middle oolite.

   I shall first describe a mutilated cranium from Shotover, preserved in the

museum of Professor Buckland at Oxford. In this specimen the sides of

the inter-temporal crest slope away, except at its anterior part, where it
expands to one inch in breadth, and is convex : its longitudinal contour is
slightly convex. The posterior boundary of the temporal fossa sinks below

the level of the upper part of the cranium, and likewise terminates above in

a sharp ridge, as in Teleosaurus. The ex-occipitals send out a transverse

ridge, increasing in size to the mastoid process, below which there is a fora-

men                        the cranial canal is cylindrical.  The ex-occipitals so completely sur-
                        :

round the posterior aperture of the cranium, that when the basi-occipital is

displaced it remains entire. This is not the case in the Teleosaurus.

   In the upper jaw the teeth are closer together and relatively larger: there are
3 teeth in front of, and 27 behind, a short diastema : there is no groove along
the inner side of the ramus of the jaw. In the lower jaw the post-articular
ON BRITISH FOSSIL REPTILES.  83

 angle is equal in length to the transverse diameter of the articular surface, ap-
proaching thus to Plesiosaurian proportions, whilst it is longer in the Gavial and

in Teleosaurus. The articular surface is convex in the middle and concave on

each side, as in the Teleosaurus, and not regularly concave, as in Gavial : the
articular piece is continued more forwards, and is stronger upon the internal

side of the i-amus. The depth of the ramus at the coronoid ridge is greater, and

the coronoid ridge itself is higher : there is no interspace between the an-

gular and surangular elements*. From the angle to the beginning of the
symphysis of the jaw is 1 foot 9 inches, the depth of the jaw at the coronoid
process is 4 inches. The nostrils are bounded by short intermaxillaries,

each of which contains three teeth. Both intermaxillary and maxillary teeth

are larger in proportion than in Teleosaurus. The maxillary teeth are ar-

ranged closer together as they are placed further back. In a fragment of
jaw containing three teeth, these are placed obliquely in sockets, from two

to three lines apart. The fang is covered by a smooth white cement ; the
crown with a black enamel, traversed by fine longitudinal, close-set, inter-
rupted ridges, one on each side of the tooth, is stronger than the rest, and
meeting, in the unworn teeth, upon an obtuse summit.

    In a fragment of a lowerjaw of apparently the same species of Steneosaurus,
in the Hunterian Collection, which includes 6 inches of the posterior com-
mencement of the symphysis, the transverse diameter, at the junction of
the rami, is 4 inches 3 lines : the middle of the posterior surface of the
junction is excavated by a deep transversely elliptical depression. Both the
upper and lower surfaces of this portion of jaw are flat, and the sides are
nearly flat, and on right angles with the horizontal surfaces ; the intervening
angles being rounded off". The inner border of the alveolar tract is higher
than the outer. The inferior flattened surface is impressed with some small,
irregular, longitudinal vascular grooves, but not with pits or foramina. Eight
teeth are contained in an extent of the alveolar tract measuring 5^ inches.
The diameter of the circular base of the crown of the tooth is from four to
five lines. The matrix appears to be oolite ; the cavities in the crowns of

the teeth are filled with white spar.
    Perhaps the most interesting fact which has resulted from an examination

of the British fossils of the present genus is the size and form of the brain,
as exhibited by an internal cast of the cranial cavity.

   In the museum of Professor Sedgwick there is a slab, in which the head

of a Steneosaurus is imbedded, the upper part being exposed, from which a
considerable part of the bony substance has been broken away, and, amongst
the rest, the whole upper wall of the cranial cavity, exposing a tolerably per-
fect cast of its interior, which represents the brain of the extinct reptile.
This cast resembles the smooth convex cerebral lobes of the Crocodile, and a
portion of the large optic lobes which lie posterior to them. The cerebrum
is 1^ inch in breadth, and the whole of the brain represented by this cast is
2 inches in length. The breadth of this head is 6-^ inches. The temporal
openings form wide ellipses, 2 inches 9 lines in the long diameter : from the
back of the cranium to the commencement of the narrow elongated jaws is 8

inches ; from these proportions the length of the individual may be calculated

at about 18 feet.

   * In the thin, long and slender jaws ascribed to the Poikilopleuron by M. Deslongchamps,
the coronoid is not raised, and there is an oblong vacuity between the angular and suran-

 gular.

   POIKILOPLEURON BUCKLANDI, Eudes-Deslongehamps.

--Nos. 1^ and , in the Mantellian Collection, are the two moieties of a

fossil caudal vertebra, fractured obliquely across the middle of the body, the

lensth of which is to the breadth of its articular extremity as 3 to 2 : both
extremities are slightly concave ; the body is gradually contracted from the
two extremities towards the middle part ; bears a transverse process deve-
loped from the posterior and upper part of its side, behind which there is a

shallow groove ; has the neural arch anchylosed, without trace of suture, to

nearly the whole of the longitudinal extent of its upper surface. The neural

arch is provided with anterior and posterior oblique processes, and a broad
and thin spine developed at its posterior part, and strongly inclined back-

wards at its origin ; lastly, the vertebra has a large meduUaiy cavity in the

centre of the body, filled, in the fossil, with spar. In all these particulars

the Palaeontologist acquainted with the excellent description by M. Eudes-

Deslongchamps of the Poikilopleuron Bucklandi, from the oolite at Caen,

will not fail to recognise the distinctive characters of that species in the

present fossil. It is attached to a mass of the common Wealden stone, which

is quarried at Tilgate, and was associated with the bones of the Ignanodon.

The length of the present vertebra is 3 inches 9 lines, or 9| centimeters

that of the caudal vertebrae of the Poikilopleuron of Caen is about a deci-

Wemeter*.  may conclude, therefore, that the individual from the Caen

oolite and that from the Wealden were of the same size, and, from this cor-

--respondence, it is most likely that the size 25 French feet, which M. Des-
--longchamps assigns to the entire animal is the common size of the species.

The vertical diameter of the articular end of the body of the Wealden ver-

tebra is 2 inches 3 lines (5J centimeters) ; the transverse diameter of the
same part is 2 inches 2 lines (5^ centimeters) ; the transverse diameter of
the middle contracted part of the body is 1 inch 4 lines (S-j centimeters).

The external free surface of the vertebra is almost smooth, being faintly
marked by fine striae. The form of the terminal surfaces of the centrum is
a full ellipse, with its long diameter vertical. The longitudinal sulcus at the
upper part of the side of the body is shallow, and slightly bent, with the con-
vexity downwards ; the base of the transverse process is continued from the

upper boundary of the groove, and extends along the posterior half of the

upper and lateral part of the centrum, and upon the base of the neural arch,

whicli is here wider than the centrum : the transverse process is broken off
near its origin. The base of the neurapophysis or side of the neural arch
leaves only a very small portion of the upper part of the centrum free at its
anterior and posterior part, to form the hole for the transmission of the spinal
nerve : the distinction between the present genus and the Cetiosaurus is

well marked in this respect. The neurapophyses have a less vertical extent

than in the corresponding vertebra of the Cetiosaurus, or even than in the

Crocodile. From the upper part of the centrum to the upper edge of the

anterior oblique process in a vertical line is only 1 inch, or about 2^ centi-
meters. The base of the spinous process is not thickest at its posterior

margin, but gradually expands transversely as it extends forwards, and then,
at a distance of 10 lines from its posterior part, it quickly contracts to a very
thin plate, which is continued forwards to the conical depression at the inter-
space of the origin of the anterior oblique processes. The upper jiart of the
spine is broken away, but the remaining base has the same backward inclina-
tion as in the Caen Poikilopletiron.

   From the size and position of the transverse process, the Tilgate vertebra

--* " Nos vertebres ont chacune en^iron un decimetre de long." Deslongchamps, I. c, p. 53.
ON BRITISH FOSSIL REPTILES.  85

corresponds with the second or third of the first series of caudal vertebraa of

the Caen PoUnlopleuron figured by M. Deslongchanips. There is one cha-
racter in the Wealden vertebra whicli is not mentioned in M. Deslong-
chanips' description of the Caen species, viz. a longitudinal sulcus at the

middle of the under surface of the bodj^ of the vertebra, at least at its ante-
rior half: the sulcus is not deep, and is 1 centimeter or 4 lines in breadtli.

The extremity of the under surface seems to be obliquely leveled off to form
a single haemapophysial surface. From this structure it might have been in-
ferred that the haemapophyses, which by their union form the chevron bone,
were closely approximated, if not confluent at their bases, as in the Iguano-
don ; the Caen specimen, in which many of the chevron bones are preserved,
proves this to have been the case. The fortunate fracture Avhich demonstrates

the peculiarly large medullary cavity in the centre of the vertebral body,
gives the best proof that could be required of the generic identity of the

Wealden vertebra with tl-.e Caen Poihilopleuron ; and the absence of that
cavity in the vertebrae of the Megalosaurus, which I have determined by a
section of one of the caudal vertebrae, establishes the distinction between that
genus and the Poihilopleuron.

   In the form of its sub-biconcave vertebrae, and the simplicity of their
neural arch as compared with the Streptospondylus and the Dinosauricms,
the Poihilopleuron manifests its closer affinity to the Ccelospondylian Croco-
diles. It agrees with the Teleosaurus in the comparative shortness of the
fore legs ; the mode of articulation of the vertebral ribs appears to be the
same, and there is no evidence that it differs in the structure of the ab-
dominal ribs.

   The number of caudal vertebrae would appear to be greater ; but I know
not in what material respect the Poihilopleuron resembles the Lizard tribe
more closely than does the Teleosaurus, unless it should be proved to have

five toes on the hind foot, and to Avant the dermal armour. Subsequent dis-

coveries may prove it to belong, like the Megalosaurus, to the Dinosaurian

order ; but as the Poihilopleuron is at present known, it seems to have most
claim to be received into the Codospondylian family of the Crocodilian
order, and perhaps has the closest affinity in that family to the Crocodilus
Bollensis, Jaeger (^Macrospondylits, H. v. Meyer).

   To the genus Poihilopleuron it is most probable that the specimen

No. ^^ in the Mantellian Collection belongs, as it agrees in size, in texture,

and especially in the character of the external surface with the caudal ver-
tebra last described. As it consists of the annular part or neural arch only,
the test of the medullary cavity of the body cannot be applied. It belongs to
one of the anterior dorsal vertebrae, and is distinguished by well-marked and
peculiar characters from the corresponding vertebrae of the Iguanodon, Me-
galosaurus, Hylaosaurus, Cetiosaurus, and Streptospondylus ; and in the chief
of these differences it approximates to the sub-biconcave Crocodilian type of

vertebrae. As only the caudal vertebrae of the Poihilopleuron appear to have

been hitherto discovered, I cannot avail myself of the aid, in the determina-

tion of the present fossil, which the able descriptions of M. Deslongchanips

afforded in reference to the preceding one ; there remains, therefore, to record
 the characters of the present fragment of a dorsal vertebra, in order that they

may be compared with more perfect ones from the oolite of 3Ialadrerie near

Caen, in the event of the remainder of the vertebral column of the Poihilo-
pleuron ever falling into the hands of the Palaeontologist.

    The present fossil is imbedded in the ferruginous sand of the Tilgate strata

its antero-posterior diameter from the extremity of the anterior to that of the

 posterior oblique process, is 5 inches 4 lines.
--86 REPORT 1841.

The neurapophyses, instead of rising and expanding to form a broad plat-

form to support the spinous process, as in the Dinosaurian vertebrae of the

Wealden, converge rapidly above the spinal canal, and support the spinous

and transverse processes by a longitudinal plate not more than from 3 to 6

lines in transverse thickness ; from each side of this plate a horizontal, flat,

broad, lamelliform transverse process, supported below by a subvertical tri-

angular plate, extends outwards and a little upwards ; and a broad, thin, and

moderately high spinous process arises, in a peculiar manner, by two laminae,

from the whole antero-posterior extent of the ridge-like summit of the neural

arch. The fossil is broken in two ; a portion of the centrum adheres to the

anterior part of the neural arch, demonstrating the anchylosis of the two

parts without trace of suture. In this respect the fossil agrees with Poikilo-

pleuron and differs from Iguanodon, in which the neural arch is anchylosed

with the centrum, but evident traces of the suture remain, at least in the

dorsal vertebrae. The anterior part of the side of- the centrum is impressed

by a large surface for the head of the rib ; the surface is concave in the axis of

the vertebra, convex vertically, and is bounded above by a well-defined ridge.

The anterior oblique processes support flat articular surfaces of an ellip-

tical form, 16 lines by 9 lines, looking upwards and inwards, their lower edges

converging at an angle of 50°. These edges are separated from each other

by a fissure 3|- lines broad, continued to the base of the anterior oblique pro-

cesses. In the Iguanodon the corresponding surfaces incline to each other

at a right angle, and the lower margins of the processes are united by a con-

tinuous tract of bone. The present fossil, in the above-cited particular, re-

sembles more the Cetiosaurus. Each anterior articular surface is supported

by a stout process convex externally, inclining forwards and slightly expand-

ing, so as to overhang and extend in a slight degree beyond the anterior end

of the centrum : these processes are relatively lower than in the IguuTiodon,

in which also they do not extend beyond the centrum : the present fossil, in

differing in these two respects from the Iguanodon, indicates characters which

Aare exaggerated in the caudal vertebrae of the Iguanodon.  deep and

narrow excavation commences immediately behind the upper and posterior

origins of the anterior oblique processes, and is continued backwards, in-

creasing in vertical extent, deep into the anterior part of the base of the

spinous process. Immediately behind the columnar portion of the anterior

oblique process a deep and wide conical cavity sinks, as it were, into the

neurapophysis, undermining the anterior part of the base of the transverse

process, and dividing the anterior oblique process from the supporting plate

of the transverse process.

The transverse process commences from the summit of the neurapophysis

immediately exterior to the anterior part of the base of the spinous process,

by a ridge which is continued backwards from the upper and outer margin

of the anterior oblique process, in a gentle curve outwards and slightly up-
wards. The posterior margin of the base of the transverse process is not

continued, in like manner, into the posterior oblique process, but terminates

or subsides into a ridge above, and separated from that process by a wide

groove.

The bases of the two transverse processes are only separated from each

other, owing to the modification of the neural arch above mentioned, by a

thickness of bone not exceeding 4 lines : the interspace of the origins of the
two transverse processes in a corresponding vertebra of the Iguanodon

measures 4 inches ; the length of the base of the neural arch being the same

in the vertebrae compared.

The antero-posterior extent of the base of the transverse process in this
ON BRITISH FOSSIL REPTILES.  87

 (presumed) vertebra of the Poikilopleuron is 2 inches 2 lines. The length
 of the transverse process is 4 inches. The vertical diameter, or thickness of
 the transverse process, where unsupported, is from 2 to 3 lines. It is obvious,
therefore, that this long, thin, lamelliform plate of bone must need further
 support, in order to sustain the rib which is appended by its tubercle to the
 extremity ; and the requisite strength is here given precisely as the carpenter
supports a shelf by a bracket. The bracket-like process is a vertical tri-

angular plate of bone, the breadth or depth of which, at its origin, is 1 inch
4 lines, and which gradually diminishes in depth and increases in thickness
as it extends along the middle of the under part of the transverse process,
until it is finally lost near the extremity of the process, which here has ex-
changed its lamellar for a prismatic form, terminating in the obtuse extremity

against which the tubercle of the rib abutted. The supporting bracket is
not quite vertical, but inclines a little forwards, and behind it there is a deep
angular fossa. The posterior oblique processes diverge from each other and
from the neural arch immediately above the posterior extremity of the spinal
canal : each articular surface, which is directed downwards and outwards,
forms, as it were, the base of a posterior root of the spinous process, which is
convex externally, diminishing in breadth as it converges to meet its fellow

at a very acute angle above a deep fissure extending forwards into the sub-
stance of the base of the spine, similarly to the fissure before described as
extending backwards from the opposite part of the spine into its substance.

As far as I could detach the matrix, these fissures extended so that they seem

to communicate, and the neural arch to be perforated by two longitudinal
passages, one for the spinal chord, and the other, running above and parallel
with the former, througli the base of the spinous process. This process is
thus partially separated at its base into two laminte, and presents a structure
which almost realizes Prof. Geoffroy's theoretical idea of the essential nature
of a spinous process, viz. that it consists of two elementary laminae, which in
fishes are superimposed one on the other, but in other Vertebrates are placed

in juxtaposition.

   The anterior parts of each spinal plate are thickened and rounded, like
those behind, and extend to the origins of the anterior oblique processes. The
diameter of this remarkable spinal fissure is from 4 to 3 lines. It is present in

an inferior degree in the Teleosaurus, but not in the vertebrae of the Igua-
nodon, Megalosaurus, or other Dinosauria.

   The base of the spinous process in this (presumed) Poikilopleuron's ver-

tebra, instead of descending from behind forwards in a graceful curve, as in
the Dinosaurs, forms a straight and almost horizontal line, 3 inches in extent
the spine maintains the same breadth to its summit, which is truncated rather
obliquely; its height is 4 inches 9 lines, measured from the upper end of the
posterior oblique processes ; it is thickened and rounded at its truncate sum-

mit. The heiglit of the spine of a corresponding vertebra of the Iguanodon,
with a centrum of the same length, is 9 inches. Thus the present vertebra
more resembles, in the form and proportions of its spinous process, as in other

characters, the vertebrae of the Crocodilians.

   The posterior part of the neural arch, with the spinous process of the ver-
tebra here described, is figured in Dr. Mantell's ' Illustrations of the Geology
of Sussex,' pi. xii. fig. 1, as the ' Lumbar Vertebra of the Iguanodon.' It is
unquestionably not a lumbar vertebra ; and if it does not belong to the Poi-
kilopleuron, it indicates an unknown genus of Crocodilians.

    In a collection of fossils belonging to S. H. Christie, Esq., from the sub-
merged Wealden beds near the Isle of Wight, there is one half of the cen-
trum of a dorsal vertebra from Brook Bay, which agrees in size, in the form

of the articular extremity, in the degree of median constriction, and, espe-
cially, in the large size of the medullary cavity at the middle of the bone,
with the vertebral characters of the Poikilopleuro?i.

   I am not aware that remains of this Crocodilian genus have hitherto been
recognised in any of the British strata. The very characteristic vertebrae

and jaws, of which the singular generic modifications Avere first described by
Cuvier,* were found in the Oxford clay formation at Honfleur, and in the

Kimmeridge clay at Havre. M. Hermann von Meyer likewise cites the lias

of Altdorf as a depository of the fossil bones of this genusf

   The distinguishing vertebral characters are a ball and socket articulation
of the bodies of the vertebrae ; but the positions of the ball and cavity are

the reverse of those in the existing Crocodiles, the convexity being on the
anterior part of the vertebra, and the concavity directed backwards. In the
anterior vertebrae, which have the ribs articulated with the body, there is a
deep pit behind the costal articular surface ; the transverse process rises by
four salient ridges, one from each oblique process, and the two inferior and
principal ones from the base of the neurapophysis ; these ridges converge at
an acute angle as they ascend, and meet at the under part of the transverse

Aprocess, so as to include a triangular space, which is deeply concave.

third salient ridge ascends from the fore part of the base of the neurapophy-
sis to the anterior oblique process, nearly parallel with the posterior of the
two last-mentioned ridges, so that the side of each neurapophysis appears as

Nif marked with the letter in high relief. In the cervical and anterior dor-

sal vertebrae there are, instead of a single inferior spinous process, two ridges
which terminate each, in front, by a tubercle, as in the vertebra dentata of

--the Crocodile.
    Streptospondylus Cuvieri, nob. The first fossil here to be noticed, which

combines any of the above defined characters, is the anterior half of an an-
terior dorsal vertebra, in the collection of Mr. Kingdon of Chipping Norton :
it was found in the oolite in the vicinity of that town.

    The articular surfaces for the ribs are, as usual, close to the anterior part
of the body of the vertebra, and this terminates by a convex articular surface,

instead of being, as in the Crocodiles, concave : the second character is the
remarkably deep pit behind each of the costal articular surfaces. It is as if a

man had pressed his two thumbs forwards and inwards up to the first joint,

into the substance of the body of the vertebra, until their extremities had
nearly met. The aperture of each pit measui'es 1 inch by 10 lines. Sufficient
 of the neurapophysial arch is preserved to show the depression which has
 separated the two anterior ridges of its external surface ; but these charac-
 teristic ridges, with the transverse, spinous and oblique processes, are broken
 away. The medullary canal is compressed, and gives an oval vertical section,
 1 inch 6 lines high, and 1 inch 2 lines wide. Both upper and lower surfaces
 of the medullary canal are flat, and join the lateral surfaces at nearly a right
 angle. There is a slight ridge along each side of the medullary canal, indi-
 cating the neurapophysial suture, which extends here outwards and obliquely

--be true that the vertebrae are slightly constricted in the middle, and have both articular

 extremities concave, as in the following description : "Die dazu gehorenden Wirbel-Korper

downwards to above the middle of the costal depression. This depression is

vertically ovate, with a deeper oblique pit in the middle, 2 inches in the long

diameter, by 1 inch 6 lines across the broadest part. The texture of this

vertebra is coarsely cellular, except for about two lines at the margin, where
it is in very compact laminae. The anterior articular surface of the centrum

is slightly and irregularly convex, being nearly flat at the upper part.

   There is a slight deviation from the symmetrical figure in the whole of

this vertebral fragment. The body of the vertebra is much contracted in

the middle, and suddenly expands to form the terminal articular surface.

This character is likewise indicated by Cuvier in his Crocodile d'Honjleur*
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

thus the transverse diameter of the middle of the vertebral body, across which

the present fossil has been fractured, measures 2 inches 3 lines, Avhilst the

same diameter of the convex articular extremity is 4 inches.

The corresponding diameters of one of the anterior dorsal vertebrae of the

Streptospondylus, described by Cuvier, are respectively 1 inch 7 lines, and

2 inches 6 lines; whence we may conjecture that the length of the entire

vertebra here described would have been 4 inches and a half. The ver-

tical diameter of the articular surface is 3 inches 9 lines.

The non-articular surface of the vertebral body is smooth, except near the

articular extremity, where it is rather coarsely rugous. The inferior ridges

and tubercles have disappeared at the part of the vertebral column to which

the present vertebra has belonged.

The osseous substance of the present fossil, like that of the bones of the

Streptospondylus from Honfleur, presents a deep chocolate brown hue, and

takes a bright polish. It is not completely mineralized ; the small cavities of
a great part of the diploe are empty, and not filled with seraitransparent cal-

careous spar, as in the Honfleur specimens.

With the portion of the vertebra above described there was associated the

extremity of a spinous process, which gradually expands to a rough obtuse

quadrilateral summit. This spine is characterized by having a very rugged

and thick ridge, developed from the anterior and posterior surface of what may

be regarded as the ordinary spinous process, the sides of which are smooth,

except near the summit.                                       Inches.  Lines.

   In the Crocodile a thin plate is continued from the anterior and posterior

edges of the thicker spinous processes ; but the Streptospondylus, if I am

correct in attributing this spinous process to that genus, presents an extreme
and peculiar development of this structure.

  A portion of a compressed, conical, hollow tooth, with a brown dense glis-

tening dentine, covered by smooth enamel, and resembling that of the Mega-
losaurits, was associated with the preceding vertebra. The length of this
fragment of tooth is 2 inches 4 lines, but both ends are wanting. The breadth

is 8 lines; the thickness 5 linesf . If it really belong to the Streptospondy-

lus, it confirms the view of the aflRnity of that genus to Megalosaurus, which
has been suggested by the characters of the vertebra. With the above frac-
tured vertebra and tooth there were likewise found, in the oolite at Chipping

Norton, a portion of a broad flat bone, with a convex, rough, articular labrum,
nearly two inches thick, and of a fine cancellous structure, and fragments of
long bones, with large medullary cavities and compact outer walls, of which
the thickness equals about one-third of the diameter of the medullary canal.

  A more perfect specimen, referable to the present genus, is a posterior

dorsal vertebra from the jet-rock (lias shale) near Whitby, and forms part
of the collection of fossils of Mr. Ripley, surgeon of that town.

   It is much more complete than the preceding specimen, wanting only the

spinous and transverse processes ; there is a slightly raised oval surface for
the articulation of the head of the rib, on each side of the body, at its upper
and anterior part, in the corresponding situation with that for the head of
the rib on the four anterior dorsal vertebrae in the existing Crocodiles : this
surface in the Whitby vertebra is relatively smaller and lower down than in
the larger specimen of Streptospondylus from the oolite.

   The present specimen nearly corresponds in size with the dorsal vertebrae
of the Honfleur Streptospondylus described by Cuvier*, as will be seen by

the following admeasurements :

                                                                                               Whitby.
ON BRITISH FOSSIL. REPTILES.                                         91

The two superior ridges, extending from the upper part of the anterior

and posterior oblique processes to the transverse process of the same side,

describe a regular concave curve.

The vertical diameter of the fractured transverse process is 1 inch 3 lines,

its transverse diameter is 1 inch.

The great development of the superior part of the neural arch, and the

strength and high relief of the buttress-like ridges supporting and strengthen-

ing the different processes, indicate that the spinous process was unusually-

large and massive. This process was not preserved in any of the vertebrae of

the Honfleur Streptospondylus described by Cuvier, nor, unfortunately, in

the present vertebra ; but its otherwise more perfect state adds another cha-
racter to those by which the vertebrae of the Streptospondylus deviate from

the Crocodilian type ; viz. a broad plate of bone extended transversely be-

tween the two posterior oblique processes, and increasing in breadth as it

ascends. The base from which the spinous process should rise, which is thus

bounded by the oblique and transverse pi'ocesses, extends beyond, and, as it

were, overhangs the whole body of the vertebra below ; and is hardly less re-

markable for the height to which it is canned above the body.

Thus from the highest part of the posterior oblique process to the lower

margin of the corresponding articular surface of the vertebral centre mea-

sures 6 inches ; the length of the vertebral centrum being 3 inches 5 lines :

the contrary proportions prevail in the posterior dorsal and lumbar vertebrae

of the existing Crocodiles. The breadth of the neural arch, where the la-

--teral buttresses terminate at the base of the transverse processes, is 6 inches.
   Streptospondylus major, nob. The third British formation in which I have

determined the remains of the genus Streptospondylus is the Wealden ; the

specimens having been obtained from three localities, viz. Tilgate Forest in

Sussex, and Brook Point and Culver Cliff in the Isle of Wight. The speci-

mens differ in size from those already described, being larger than the Strep-

tospondylus Cuvieri from the oolite ; I strongly suspect that they indicate a
distinct species, but the means of comparison for the satisfactory establish-

ment of the distinctions are as yet wanting. M. H. von Meyer has added

nothing but the generic name to the observations of Cuvier, on which the

claims of the present extinct Crocodilian to generic distinction are founded

these observations were taken from the dorsal vertebrae, atlas and axis, whilst

the most characteristic of the Wealden vertebrae appertain to the middle part

of the cervical region, from whence vertebrae of the reversed ball and socket

system have not been hitherto recognized.

   These vertebrae I apprehend to be those on which Dr. Mantell has founded

his description of the " Fourth system " from the Wealden. He says, " The

vertebrae of the fourth system (tig. 4) are very rare, only six or seven have

come under my observation. They are of the true Lacertian type, having the

articular facets of the body convex posteriorly and concave anteriorly, and

are loider than high, as in the Iguana and Monitors, and not in the reverse

proportions, as in the recent Crocodiles. In two large but mutilated cervi-

cals, the admeasurements are as follow :

" Height of the concave extremity          Inch.

    It is the fortunate preservation of the two articular, or oblique processes,
at one of the extremities of the annular part of this fine cervical vertebra,

now in the Mantellian Collection, British Museum (No. ^j|), that has enabled
me to correct the error into which the Founder of that noble collection has,

in this instance, fallen : the flat oblong articular surface of each of these
strong and -well-marked oblique processes looks downwards and outwards,
determining them to be the posterior pair ; and they overhang the concave
extremity of the body of the vertebra, determining that to be the posterior

extremity. The opposite, or anterior end of the body of the same fossil, is
convex. The few other large convexo-concave vertebrae from the Wealden

of Tilgate correspond with the one here described in these important charac-
ters of the genus Streptospondylus, and equally differ from the vertebrae of

the Iguana, Monitors, and all other existing Sauria. Of the fossil cervical

vertebra, 6 inches long, the anterior extrenuty of the body is further indicated
by the position of the costal tubercle, or transverse process, which is deve-
loped as a strong obtuse ridge from the middle part of that half of the cen-
trum which is nearest the convex articulation. Beneath this ridge the sides
of the body are concave, and converge to a broad ridge, which terminates
the anterior part of the lower surface of the vertebra, and corresponds with
the process given off from that part in the cervical vertebrae of the Crocodile.

A second concavity, at the upper part of the side of the body, separates the

transverse process, or ridge, from the base of the neural arch ; from which a
second, or upper transverse process is developed for the attachment of the

tubercle of the rib.

   The neural arch has been crushed down upon the centrum, and its anterior
oblique processes and spine are broken away ; the upper, non- articular part

of the strong diverging posterior oblique processes is convex.

   In the museum of Mr. SauU, F.G.S., Aldersgate Street, there is a cervical

vertebra of the great Streptospondylus associated, as in the Mantellian Col-

lection, with vertebrae of the Iguanodon and Cetiosaurus, all of Avhich have
been washed out of the submarine Wealdan beds at the south side of the
Isle of Wight, and thrown on shore near Culver Cliffs and Brook Point.

   The lower half of the sides of the centrum of the vertebra of the Strep-

tospondylus are, like the preceding vertebra from Tilgate, concave and ob-
liquely compressed, so as to converge to the anterior part of the under sur-
face, which thus presents a triangular form, with the apex forming the obtuse
anterior ridge, and the base turned backward and somewhat flattened. Each
lateral concavity is bounded above by a short but broad transverse process,
developed from the anterior half of that part of the centrum, and terminated
by an oblong flattened surface for the articulation of the head of the cervi-
cal rib ; which surface is about twice as long in the antero-posterior as the
vertical direction. Above this process the centrum is again concave. The
base of the neurapophysis is anchylosed to nearly the whole antero-posterior
extent of the centrum, the course of the original straight suture being readily

discernible. An upper transverse process is developed from the side of the

base of the neurapophysis, affording a broader surface for the tubercle of the

cervical rib than does the lower transverse process. Above the upper trans-

verse process the neurapophyses converge obliquely to the base of the spinous

process. The line of tlae base of the spine inclines forwards, and the thick-
ness of the spine diminishes in the same direction. The difference in the

height of the neural arch, and in the configuration of its external surface,
which both the cervical vertebrae of the great Wealden Streptospondylus pre-
sent, when compared with the dorsal vertebrae of the smaller specimens from

the older oolite formations, is very great ; and the more remarkable, as in the
                 ON BRITISH FOSSIL REPTILES.                                    93

existing Crocodiles the height of the neurapophyses is greater in the cervical

than in the dorsal region : as, however, the transverse processes in the Cro-

codiles come off from a higher part of the neural arch in the dorsal than in
the cervical vertebrae, the spine of the great Wealden Streptospondylus may

possibly present modifications in the dorsal region corresponding with those

remarkable ones which have been already described in the Whitby vertebra.

The posterior articular processes in the cervical vertebra from Culver Point,

are similar in all respects to those in the Tilgate specimen, and equally de-

termine the fore and hind extremities of the vertebra.

The following are admeasurements of the bodies of the two vertebrae of

the Wealden Streptospondyhcs :              Tilgate.             Culver Cliff.

   In the museum of the Geological Society of London there is a collection
of rolled vertebra? from the coast at Brook Point, Isle of Wight, whicli, among
the bones of Iguanodon and other gigantic Wealden genera, contains the

centrum or body of a dorsal vertebra of the great Streptospondylus. This

specimen, though much rolled and worn, is interesting, inasmuch as it ex-

hibits the characteristic contraction of the middle and expansion of the ends
of the centrum, together with unequivocal evidences of the marked depres-
sion on each side, near the upper part of the anterior or convex end of the

centrum. What remains of the depression is about the size of the end of a
man's thumb. The convexity of the anterior extremity resembles in degree,

and likewise in irregularity, that in the fractured vertebra of the Streptospon-
dylus from the oolite, in Mr. Kingdon's collection.

   The present centrum is less depressed than those of the cervical region,

--but agrees with them in length, as the following dimensions show :

 epoch, removes one of the chief difficulties attending the determination of
 the true vertebral cliaracters of the Iguanodon. For if gigantic vertebrae,

 agreeing in the important character of their articular surfaces with the ex-
 isting Iguana, had actually been discovered, though of rare occurrence, asso-
 ciated with teeth of corresponding dimensions, but similar in form to those
 of the Iguana, there would have been strong ground for suspicion, that such
vertebrae and teeth might be parts of the same species *

fleur, on which M. H. von Meyer has imposed the name of Streptospondylus,
forms, therefore, an essential step in the appropriation to the Iguanodon of

its true vertebral characters.

                                               Cetiosaurus.

  --Cetiosaurus brevis, nob. The attempt to reduce to order the various forms

and types of vertebrae, which the Wealden strata have yielded to test the saga-
city of the interpreters of its organized treasures, was one of Dr. Mantell's
earliest labours, and he states f that his first step was, with the able assist-

ance of the Rev. W. D. Conybeare, to separate those that belonged to the

Crocodile, Plesiosaurus and Megalosaurus, or rather which resembled those

from Stonesfield. Many enormous vertebrae then remained, from which those

belonging to the Iguanodon were to be chosen ; from these residuary speci-
mens the characteristic ones of the PoiMlopleuron and Streptospondylus have
already been eliminated, and I next proceed to remove from them the verte-
brae which characterize the genus Cetiosaurus.

   Of the existence of vertebrae of this genus in the Wealden strata, I first

became acquainted by the examination of Mr. SauU's collection of sea-rolled
fossils washed out of the submerged Wealden beds, and deposited on the
shores of the Isle of Wight, at Sandover Bay.

   The vertebrae in question present the well-marked generic characters of

those of the dorsal region in the Cetiosaurus. as the breadth of the centrum,
its subcircular contour, its median contraction and unequal concavity of the

articular extremities ; as, also, the short antero-posterior extent of the neura-

pophysis, and their anchylosis to the anterior part of the upper surface of the
centrum : but they differ from the vertebrae on which the characters of the
present genus were first founded J by the shortness of their antero-posterior
diameters as compared with their breadth and depth, whence I propose to de-
signate the species by the name of Cetiosaurus brevis.

    * This suspicion is expressed, but with due caution, by Dr. Mantell in his ' Geology of
the South-east of England.' " The somewhat angular vertebrae, described as appearing to
constitute a Second System, I should be disposed, from their number, and from their so
commonly occurring in the localities where the teeth of the Iguanodon most abound, to refer
to that animal ; it must, however, be mentioned, that the concavo-convex vertebrae which
correspond so entirely with those of the Iguana and Monitor, would seem to offer a more

probable approximation yet the extreme rarity of the latter renders it questionable, since
                                                                                                                      ;

there appears no reason why the vertebrae shoiild not have been preserved in as consider-

--able numbers as the teeth." p. 306. The vertebrae of the Iguanodon discovered by Mr. Ben-

stead in the greensand quarries near Maidstone, are so crushed or so imbedded, as to prevent

a satisfactory determination of both articular extremities.

One of the articular ends * is rather more concave than the other, which, from

the wearing away of the margins, appears slightly and unevenly convex. The

contracted middle part of the vertebra is concave lengthwise, and pretty regu-

larly convex in the direction transverse to the axis of the vertebra : the free

surface is finely striated, and perforated here and there by vascular foramina

there is no lateral depression. The neurapophyses were broken off; their

bases, instead of having their long diameter corresponding with the axis of

the vertebra, as in Iguanodon, present it in the direction transverse to that

axis, as in Plesiosaurus : they do not quite meet at the middle of the upper

or neural surface of the centrum, but are there divided by a narrow longitu-

dinal tract forming the lower part of the spinal canal.

The antero-posterior extent of the anchylosed base of the neural arch is

2 inches 6 lines : the transverse diameter, 5 inches.

   Two caudal vertebrae of the same species, also from Culver Cliff, present

the same length and unequal concavity of the articular extremities ; the an-

terior one, here determinable by the anterior position of the narrower hsema-

pophyses, being the deepest : the sides of the body are more compressed, and

more convergent towards the under surface ; so that, as the expanded margins
of the articular ends are worn away, the centrum presents rather a triangular

than a subcircular contour. The disproportion of its antero-posterior with its

transverse and vertical diameters, distinguishes it from the caudal vertebras

of the Iguanodon. The neurapophysis rises from the anterior three-fourths

of the centrum, and sends forwards a subprismatic anterior oblique process,

but does not develope a posterior one : it then contracts, and inclines to the

base of the spine, which is much shorter than in the Iguanodon. The spi-

nous process inclines backwards from the vertical axis of the centrum at an

Aangle of 45°.  short transverse process is developed from the junction of

the neurapophysis with the centrum. The haemapophysial surfaces appear

single on both the anterior and posterior parts of the lower surface ; they are

nearly flat, and slope towards each other.

   The characters and dimensions of these rolled vertebrae of Cetiosaurus
from the submarine beds of the Wealden formation, although somewhat ob-

scured by the circumstances under which they are brought to light, are suf-
ficiently satisfactory to establish their generic character, and to give an use-
ful approximative idea of their size and proportions. The corresponding
bones from the Wealden of Tilgate Forest supply, by their more perfect state
of preservation, the deficiencies of the Isle of Wight specimens, and further
establish the co-existence of the Cetiosaurus with the Iguanodon, Strepto-
spondylus, Megalosaurus and other extraordinary reptiles of that period.

most gigantic specimens of Saurian remains that enrich it. They include the
bodies of two dorsal vertebrae and four entire caudal vertebrae, which, if not
consecutive, seem to have come not from distant parts of the basal portion of
the tail of the same individual ; there are also the bodies of several of the

smaller posterior caudal vertebrae.

 ^No. (" Gigantic vertebra of Igucmodon" MS. Catalogue of Mantellian

Collection,) is a posterior dorsal vertebra of the Cetiosaurus hrevis, and ex-
hibits in a striking manner the peculiar characters of this species, viz. the
great depth and breadth, especially the latter dimension, as compared with
the length or antero-posterior diameter of the centrum or body of the ver-

tebra.

   The posterior articular facet is, in this region of the spine, more concave

than the anterior surface, a structure which approximates to that peculiar one

which characterizes the Streptospondylus *. The contour of the articular

ends is a full transverse oval : the middle of the centrum is strongly con-
tracted, slightly concave in the longitudinal direction at the upper part of
the side of the centrum, but deeply concave below, and with a slight indica-
tion of a broad, obtuse longitudinal ridge along the middle of the concave
under surface. In the Iguanodon the sides of the vertebral body are nearly
flat in the vertical direction ; in the Cetiosaurus they are strongly convex.
The surface at the middle of the vertebra is longitudinally striated with very
fine, subparallel, short impressions : these grow deeper and more irregular at
the thick, rugged and everted margins of the ai'ticular ends.

   The neurapophyses are firmly anchylosed here, as in the caudal region,
and the line of the primitive suture is hardly discernible : their base is shorter

than the short centrum, and is attached nearer its anterior part : in the Igua-
nodon the neural arch is very nearly coextensive in antero-posterior diameter
with the centrum supporting it : in a dorsal vertebra, of an Iguanodon 4^
inches in breadth, the antero-posterior extent of the base of the neural arch
is 4- inches : in the present vertebra, which exceeds 7 inches in breadth, the
antero-posterior extent of the base of the neural arch is 21 inches, and only

2 inches a little above the base. The outer side of the neurapophysis is con-

vex in the axis of the vertebra, and concave in the opposite direction as it
ascends to the base of the transverse process, without exhibiting a trace of the
ridges and hollows that so singularly characterize the same part in the dorsal

vertebrae of the Streptospondylus Cuvieri. The antero-posterior diameter of

the base of the transverse process is 2 inches ; its vertical diameter 1 inch.

The diameter of the spinal canal is 1 inch 9 lines. The articular surfaces of

the anterior oblique processes are flat, and look upwards and slightly inwards.
In the Iguanodon their under margins, in the dorsal vertebrae, converge at
nearly a right angle : in the present vertebra they incline to each other at an
angle of 40°. The spinous process begins to rise immediately behind the
anterior oblique processes by a narrow vertical plate, which seems as if it

    * Since the vertebrae of the Streptospondylus lose their peculiar convexo-concave charac-
ter by the gradual subsidence of the anterior ball, as they approach the tail, the cervical

vertebrae of the Cetiosaurus may approach, more nearly than do the dorsal ones, to the con-
vexo-concave structure of the Streptospondylian vertebrje. The fact that, hitherto, only
cervical vertebriE of the great Streptospondylus, and only dorsal and caudal vertebrae of the
Cetiosaurus, have been discovered in the Wealden formations, has induced me well to con-
sider the grounds for assigning them to Saurians of distinct genera. But the general con-
stancy of the vertebraj of the same Saurian in their antero-posterior diameter, forbids the

supposition of a vertebra of six inches in length in the neck being associated with one of
three inches in length in the back. Additional evidence of a very decisive character must
at least be obtained before the great Cetiosam- can be admitted to have resembled the Ptero-
dactyle in such disproportionate length of the cervical vertebrae.

were nipped in between two shallow depressions ; its base ascends obliquely,
and grows thicker to the posterior part of tlie neural arch. The summit is

not entire.

   The height of this dorsal vertebra to the posterior origin of the spinous
process is 9^ inches : from the base of the neurapophysis to the upper part

of the transverse process, measures 3 inches.

   No. " 1^ " in the Mantellian Collection, (" Vertebra of Iguanodon, 8 inches
in diameter," MS. Catalogue), may have actually presented that dimension

when entire, for even now, not allowing for the margin of the posterior arti-

cular surface which has been broken away, it measures 7 inches across that

surface. This remarkable specimen, which may probably have afforded the
type of the 'third or plano-concave' vertebral system, in the summary of the
vertebral characters of the Wealden reptiles given by Dr. Mantell in his

' Geology of the South-east of England*,' and which accords best with the

characters assigned by M. H. von Meyer to the vertebrae of the Iguanodon\,

presents, in fact, in a striking degree, those of the vertebrae of the Cetiosaurus,
and belongs to a more posterior part of the dorsal region, perhaps to the loins,
of the same individual, certainly to one of the same species, as the vertebra
(No. 2133) last described.

   The anterior articular extremity makes the same approach to a plane sur-

face, being slightlj^ concave below and very slightly convex above : the depth

of the posterior concave surface at the centre is 9 lines. The general con-
tour of the centrum has begun to change from the circular to the subqua-
drate, which latter figure is more decidedly expressed in the anterior caudal

vertebrae of the Cetiosaurus brevis.

   The upper half of the sides of the centrum are more concave in the axis
of the vertebra than in No. 2133. The free surface presents the same de-
gree of smoothness, and is pierced here and there by moderate-sized vascu-
lar foramina. The spinal canal makes a slight depression in the upper part
of the centrum : in the Iguanodon it is encompassed by the bases of the neu-
rapophyses. The transverse diameter of the spinal canal is 1 inch, Avhich
small dimension satisfactorily distinguishes the present enormous vertebra
from those of the raammiferous class, viz. the Cetacea, to which in other re-
spects it has the greatest similitude. The antero-posterior diameter of the

base of the neurapophysis is 2 inches.

   The four anterior caudal vertebras in the Mantellian Collection, which are

here assigned to the Cetiosaurus brevis, slightly increase in antero-posterior
diameter, as is the case in the Cetiosaurus medius, as they recede from the

trunk, which seems to indicate that the present gigantic marine Saurian must
have had a capacious and bulky trunk, but propelled by a longer and more
Crocodilian tail than in the modern whales. It is sufficiently evident, how-
ever, that, even in the present short segment of the tail, with the slight in-
crease of length, there is a diminution of height and breadth of the centrum,
and a still more obvious subsidence of the neural arch, as the vertebrae recede
from the trunk. As compared with the dorsal vertebrae, the chief change of
form is the subquadrate contour produced by a lateral extension and flattening
of the lower surface of the centrum, which is more essentially distinguished
by four haemapophysial articular surfaces, two at the anterior and two at the
posterior margins of this inferior surface. The articular surfaces at both ends
of the centrum are now concave ; and the anterior one, which was nearly flat
 in the dorsals, is here the deepest ; it is one inch deep at the upper third of

the surface *. The sides of the centrum at the upper half are concave both

lengthwise and vertically, forming a wide depression below the transverse

process                                  the middle part of the side begins to stand out and divide the upper
                                      ;

from the lower lateral concavity, which character, being more strongly deve-

loped in the hinder caudal vertebrae, gives the rhomboidal or hexagonal formf.

The lower half of the side of the centrum is less concave than in the dorsal
vertebrae. The broad inferior surface is also less concave antero-posteriorly

than in the dorsal vertebrae, and is nearly flat transversely : it gradually con-

tracts, in the transverse direction, in the posterior caudals, so as to take on the

form of a longitudinal sulcus. The two anterior haemapophysial surfaces are

separated from each other by an interval of two inches ; the two posterior

surfaces, which are larger than the anterior ones, are similarly distinct.

In the Iguanodon the haemapophysial surfaces are confluent on both the

anterior and posterior parts of the under surface of the centrum, and the che-

vron bones accordingly present modifications by which they may, when de-

tached, be distinguished from those of the Cetiosaurus,

The transverse processes have descended, as usual, from the summit to the

base of the neural arch in the present anterior caudal vertebrae. They are

short, compressed vertically, diminishing, and as if slightly twisted, so that the

upper margin is turned forwards, at their extremity. The vertical diameter

of the base of the transverse process in the largest of the present caudal ver-

tebrae is three inches ; its anterior-posterior diameter one inch six lines ; its

length two inches seven lines : the extremity terminates obtusely. The upper

ridge-like termination of the transverse process is continued to the base of

the anterior oblique processes. These processes are alone developed in the

present vertebree, the posterior articular surfaces being impressed upon the

sides of the posterior part of the base of the spine. The anterior oblique

processes project almost horizontally forwards, diminishing, chiefly in vertical

diameter, to an obtuse apex ; convex externally, flattened internally by the

oblong articular surface, and separated by a fissure nearly one inch wide

the length of these processes, from the bottom of the intervening fissure in

the second of the four caudals, where they are most entire, is two inches.

When the vertebrae are placed in juxtaposition, these processes reach beyond

the middle of the vertebrae next in front, and pinch, as it were, the back part

of the base of the spine so as to impress upon it the surfaces representing the

posterior articular processes. These processes are well developed, on the

contrary, in the corresponding vertebraj of the Iguanodon, and overhang the

posterior surface of the body of the vertebra to which they belong. The spi-

nous process, which appears to be nearly perfect in the second caudal, is short,

strong, and truncated at the summit. Its height from the anterior oblique

processes is four inches : the total height of the vertebra is thirteen inches.

The antero-posterior diameter of the side of the neural arch is two inches.
The spinal canal is wider in these caudal than in the dorsal vertebrje, indica-

ting the greater muscularity of the part deriving its nervous po-wer from the

corresponding part of the spinal chord : its transverse diameter is one inch ten

lines ; its vertical diameter is two inches. The neural arch is, as usual in the

present genus, anchylosed to the anterior part of the upper surface of the cen-

trum : one inch and a half of this surface is left free behind the attachment

tebral column of the Plesiosaurus. See ' Report on Brit. Foss. Reptiles,' iiart i. Trans. Brit.

of the arch. The finely wrinkled or fibrous character of the free surface is
more strongly marked in these caudal than in the dorsal vertebrae.

    In the three succeeding vei'tebrae the neural arch diminishes in height, the
anterior articular processes diminish in length, and the posterior articular im-

pressions in depth. The upper and lower parts of the sides of the body be-
come somewhat more concave; the posterior articular surface grows flatter.

  A detached chevron bone, eight inches in length, consisting of two haema-

pophyses, anchylosed only at their distal or inferior extremities, and with their
distinct proximal ends more divaricated than are the confluent ones in the
Iguanodon, corresponds with the caudal vertebrae here described, and doubt-

less belongs to the Cetiosaurus brevis.

   The following are dimensions taken from the four caudal vertebrae above

described :

quently discovered and in the collection of Mr. Kingdon, that the characters
of the Cetiosaurus were first determined*. They include a portion of the
tail consisting of ten vertebrae ; the anterior and larger ones were five inches
and a half in length, seven inches across the articular surface at each end of
the body, and not less than two feet in vertical diameter, including the neural
(superior) and haemal (inferior) spines. Both articular extremities are con-
cave, the anterior one being rather the deepest; but the difference is less
than in the Cetiosaurus brevis. The articular cavities become shallower in
the posterior caudal vertebrae ; these gradually diminish in transverse and
vertical diameter, but retain the same length, even %vhen they are reduced to
two inches and one inch and a half in breadth. The body of the vertebra
has no central cavity, in which respect the present, like the preceding species

of Cetiosaurus, may be distinguished from the Poikilopleuro7i, where such
cavity exists. The neurapophysis does not equal in antero-posterior extent

the centrum or body of the vertebra, the disparity increasing in the posterior
caudal vertebras : the arch is placed towards the anterior end of the vertebra.
The hsemapophysial arch has a less contracted base than in the Igaanodon,,
and the proximal extremities of the haemapophyses are free, as in the Cetio-

saurus brevis.

   One of the ungual phalanges, which is conical, snbcompressed, and slightly

curved, is traversed on each side by the usual vascular groove, curved with
the convexity upwards, measuring five inches in length, and three and a half
across its articular base. The bone alluded to in Buckland's ' Bridgewater
Treatise,' vol. i. p. 115, and figured in Mr. Lyell's ' Elements of Geology'
(1838), p. 384-, is a metatarsal of the Cetiosaurus. This fossil was found in
the great oolite of Enstone, near Woodstock.

  A few large caudal vertebrae, and other bones of the Cetiosaurus, have been

discovered in the oolite of the neighbourhood of the town of Buckingham,
and form part of Dr. Buckland's museum.

   Some vertebrae, an entosternal bone, a coracoid, scapula, and fragments of
long bones, belonging apparently to the same skeleton, were disinterred from

the middle oolite during the railway cuttings near Blisworth, and are pre-
served in the collection of Miss Baker at Northampton. The anterior trans-

verse branch of the entosternum measures upwards of four feet across. The

posterior caudal vertebree, which, like those from Chipping Norton, measure
five inches and a half in length, have a more hexagonal form, resembling,

in this respect, the terminal caudal vertebrae of the Cetiosaurus brevis of the

Wealden ; they are, however, like the Chipping Norton specimens, of greater

length.

   In the museum of Professor Sedgwick, there is a caudal vertebra of the
Cetiosaurus from the neighbourhood of Stratford-on-Avon. The size of the

fossils hitherto obtained of the Cetiosaurus medius, especially the vertebrae,

if calculated according to the numbers and proportions of those of the Cro-

--codiles, gives a length of forty feet to this species.
   Cetiosaurus longus. In Professor Buckland's museum are preserved some

fossil remains, principally vertebrte, of another enormous Saurian, which

the form and texture of the vertebrae prove to belong to the genus Cetio-

saurus, but which differ in the proportions of the vertebras. One of these

verse diameter, seven inches nine lines ; in vertical diameter of the centrum,

Aare subcircular. fractured dorsal or lumbar vertebra, from the same locality,

with transverse processes extending obliquely backwards from the upper part

of the sides of the body, measures one foot across the nearly flat articular sur-

stone at Thame, measures seven inches four lines in antero-posterior diameter

six inches six lines in transverse diameter ; and seven inches eight lines in ver-

tical diameter. The under surface is concave lengthwise, and nearly flat from

Aside to side ; it is perforated by many large vascular canals.  third caudal

vertebra is somewhat shorter in antero-posterior diameter, but exceeds the pre-

ceding in vertical diameter, which is eight inches. In all these vertebrae the

neurapophyses are anchylosed to the centrum, and have a smaller antero-pos-

terior extent at their base than the centrum, as in the preceding species of

Cetiosaurus. In all the species the haemapophyses are articulated to the in-

terspaces of two vertebree. To the Cetiosaurus longus is referable a vertebra,

eight inches in length of body, and nine inches in transverse diameter, from

the Yorkshire oolite at White Nab, which, together with some metatarsal bones,

are deposited in the museum at Scarborough. No teeth, or fragments of jaws

or cranium, have hitherto been discovered, which can, with certainty, be re-

ferred to any of the preceding species.

The names which I propose to give to these species refer to the relative

length of their vertebrae, and from what we know of the constancy and re-

gularity of this dimension in the back bone of individuals of the same species

of Saurian, these specific names would, if we had the entire animals, be found

to be as appropriate in reference to the relative length of their whole bodies.

At present the Cetiosaurus brevis is known to me only by specimens from

the Wealden strata ; the Cetiosaurus medius by fossils from the lower oolite,

and the Cetiosaurus longus by a few vertebrae from both the upper and the

lower oolite ; but how far these species should actually characterize these

divisions of the great oolitic system, will depend on the results of ulterior

researches and a longer experience. It is certain, however, that we have in

these remains ample proof of the existence, at that period of the earth's his-

tory which has been aptly termed the 'Age of Reptiles,' of another gigantic

genus in addition to the Pliosaurus, Poikilopleuron, Streptospoiidylus, Igua-

nodon, Megalosaurus and Hylceosaurus.

The enormous Cetiosauri, some of which must have rivalled the modern

whales in bulk, may be presumed to have been of strictly aquatic and most

probably of marine habits, on the evidence of the sub-biconcave structure of

the vertebrae, and of the coarse cancellous tissue of the long bones, which

show no trace of medullary cavity. In the great expanse of the coracoid and

pubic bones, as compared with the Teleosaurs and Crocodiles, the gigantic

Saurians in question manifested their closer affinity to the Enaliosauria

their essential adherence to the Crocodilian type is marked by the form of the

long bones of the extremities, especially the metatarsals ; and, above all, by

the toes being terminated by strong claws. The main organ of swimming is

shown, by the strength and texture, and vertical compression of the poste-

rior caudal vertebras, to have been a broad vertical tail : and the webbed feet,

probably, were used only partially in regulating the course of the swimmer,

as in the puny Amblyrhynchus of the Gallipagos Islands, the sole known ex-

ample of a Saurian of marine habits at the present period.

rians, is characterized by a large sacrum composed of five anchylosed ver-

 tebrse of unusual construction, by the height and breadth and outward sculp-
 turing of the neural arch of the dorsal vertebrae, by the twofold articulation
 of the ribs to the vertebrae, viz. at the anterior part of the spine by a head
 and tubercle, and along the rest of the trunk by a tubercle attached to the
transverse process only ; by broad and sometimes complicated coracoids and
long and slender clavicles, whereby Crocodilian characters of the vertebral
column are combined with a Lacertian type of the pectoral arch ; the dental
organs also exhibit the same transitional or annectent characters in a greater
or less degree. The bones of the extremities are of large proportional size,
for Saurians ; they are provided with large medullary cavities, and with well
developed and unusual processes, and are terminated by metacarpal, metatarsal
and phalangeal bones, which, with the exception of the ungual phalanges,
more or less resemble those of the heavy pachydermal Mammals, and attest,
with the hollow long -bones, the terrestrial habits of the species.

    The combination of such characters, some, as the sacral ones, altogether
peculiar among Reptiles, others borrowed, as it were, from groups now distinct
from each other, and all manifested by creatures far surpassing in size the
largest of existing reptiles, will, it is presumed, be deemed sufficient ground
for establishing a distinct tribe or sub-order of Saurian Reptiles, for which I
would propose the name o{ Dinosauria*.

   Of this tribe the principal and best established genera are the Megalosau-

rus, the Hi/lcBosmirus, and the Iguanodon ; the gigantic Crocodile-lizards of
the dry land, the peculiarities of the osteological structure of which distin-
guish them as clearly from the modern terrestrial and amphibious Sauria, as
the opposite modifications for an aquatic life characterize the extinct Ena-

liosauria, or Marine Lizards.

                                        Megalosaurus.

   Of the gigantic Lacertians in question, the most remarkable are the Mega-

losaurus, Iguanodon, and HylcBosaurus, the worthy fruits of the laborious re-
searches of Prof. Buckland and Dr. Mantell. With respect to the Megalo-
saurus, the great carnivorous terrestrial Lizard of the Wealden and Oolitic

period, the lucid descriptions of its discoverer in his original Memoir and the

'Bridgewater Treatise,' and the judicious remarks of Cuvier on its natural
affinities, leave little to be added, save the observations on the sacrum, to the
present brief record of the strata and localities in which the remains of the

Megalosaurus have been found.

   The most complete collection of the bones of this genus has been derived
from the oolite of Stonesfield, where the original specimens were first dis-
covered. Dr. Buckland now possesses in his valuable collection portions of a
lower jaw, the principal fragment containing a tooth fully developed, and the
germs of several others ; detached dorsal, caudal, and a series of five sacral
vertebrae, ribs, two coracoid bones, a clavicle, humerus, radius, an ilium, an

ischium, a femur, fibula, metacarpal and metatarsal bones.
    These parts have not been discovered so associated together as to prove

them to belong to the same animal ; but the peculiar characters of some of
the bones, which distinguish them from the other oviparous reptiles of the
same strata, and the agreement in texture and proportionate size of the others,

render their reference to the Megalosaurus highly probable.

The essential characters of the most authentic of these remains prove the

Megalosaurus to have been closely related to the Lacertian division of the

Saurian order ; but the teeth, the vertebrae, and some of the bones of the ex-

tremities, indicate its affinities to the Crocodilian group, and all these parts

manifest more or less stronglj' the peculiar characters of its own remarkable

family. In the instructive and characteristic portion of the lower jaw, the

sockets, like the teeth, are compressed, and are separated by complete parti-

tions                        but they are so much wider than the teeth, as to suggest the existence
                          ;

of a greater proportion of ligamentous gum at the upper part of the alveolar

tract in the recent animal than in the Crocodiles. " The outer rim of the

jaw rises almost an inch above the inner rim, and forms a continuous lateral

parapet, supporting the teeth externally ; whilst the inner rim throws up a

series of triangular plates of bone, forming a zigzag buttress along the in-

terior of the alveoli. From the centre of each triangular plate, a bony septum

crosses to the outer parapet, thus completing the alveolus*." There is a
slight groove and ridge along the inner side of the sockets, and it is at this

groove, at the interspace of each triangular plate, that the apices of the new
teeth protrude. The teeth have compressed, conical, pointed crowns, with

trenchant and serrate anterior and posterior edges. They appear straight
when they first protrude, but are bent in the progress of growth ; in the course
of development the crown of the tooth is solidified, and the anterior margin

at the base of the crown becomes smooth and convex. The smooth enamelled

surface of the tooth presents fine polished wrinkles.

In all existing Lizards the teeth are anchylosed, either to the side of an

outer alveolar parapet, according to the pleurodont type, or to its summit, ac-

cording to the acrodont type. The double parapet, inclosing and concealing

the germs and the bases of the full-grown teeth, is a remarkable approach in

the present gigantic Dinosaur to the Crocodilian structure, the similarity in
this respect no doubt resulting from a similar necessity in the carnivorous

Megalosaur for a firm lodgment of the destructive maxillary weapons. The

higher development of the outer alveolar parapet bespeaks the affinity of the

Megalosauriis to the Lizards : in the form of the teeth it approaches nearest

to the Varanian family, which at the present day includes the largest, and most

carnivorous species of Lizard.

  --VertebrcE. The Megalosaur deviates more decidedly from the existing Mo-

nitors and Lizards in its vertebral characters. These are afforded, at present,

by the sacral, a few costal and caudal vertebrae. The articulating surfaces of
the body of the vertebra are nearly flat or slightly concave, as in the ccelospon-

dylianf Crocodiles. The non-articular surface is remarkably smooth and po-
lished. The body is much contracted in the middle : the margins of the ex-
panded articular extremities are thick and rounded off". The middle contracted

part of the body is nearly cylindrical, being nipped in, as it were, by a more

or less deep longitudinal fossa on each side, just below the base of the neural

arch, but again slightly expands to support that part. The length of the base

of the neurapophysis is nearly equal to that of the centrum : the suture is per-

sistent, as in Crocodiles ; its course is undulating, and it rises in the middle.

The neurapophysis ascends and inclines outwards, to form, at a height above

the centrum equal to three-fourths its vertical diameter, the margin of a broad

platform of bone, from the sides of which the transverse processes are deve-

Aloped, and from the middle part the spinous process.  strong ridge or but-

tress of bone extends from the posterior angle of the base of the neurapophy-

   t I find this collective term convenient in application to those Crocodilians which have
the vertebrae concave at both ends.

sis obliquely forwards to the under part of the transverse process ; behind
which ridge there is a deep depression, separating it from the posterior arti-
cular process. These processes are relatively smaller than in the Iguanodon,

and do not project beyond the hinder end of the centrum. The spinal plat-

form descends in a gentle curve from the posterior to the anterior oblique
processes : the base of the strong and thick spinous process follows this curve
along the middle line of the platform ; its antero-posterior extent was 4^
inches, in a vertebra having the centrum of the same length, with a vertical
diameter of 4 inches, and measuring 7^ inches from the under part of the

centrum to the posterior part of the base of the spine.

 --Sacrum. The sacrum of the Megalosaurus consists of five anchylosed

vertebrae, and it is remarkable enough, considering how small a proportion

of the recognizable bones of this rare reptile has been found, that the present

characteristic part of the vertebral column of three different individuals should

have been obtained : one sacrum, from Stonesfield, is in the museum of Dr.
Buckland at Oxford ; a second sacrum, from Dry Sandford, in the museum of
the Geological Society ; and a third sacrum, from the Wealden formation, in

the British Museum.
   I have studied each of these specimens with much attention, which a recog-

nition of their remarkable structure has well repaid.

   It would seem that Cuvier did not regard the five anchylosed vertebrae
figured in Dr. Buckland's original memoir, as the sacrum of the Megalosaurus.

They are briefly alluded to in the second and fourth editions of the ' Osse-
mens Fossiles,' and in the description of the Plate, in which Dr. Buckland's

figure is reproduced as a ' Suite de cinq vertebres de Megalosaurus.' In truth

the sacrum was not known to be represented, at that time, in any Saurian by
more than two vertebrfe, and therefore Dr. Buckland mentions this part in
his original memoir as " five anchylosed joints of the vertebral column, in-

cluding the two sacral and two others, which are probably referable to the

lumbar and caudal vertebrae*." In contemplating this series of five anchy-

losed vertebrae, so new in Saurian anatomy, my attention was first arrested by

the singular position of the foramina for the transmission of the nerves from

the inclosed spinal marrow. These holes, which, in the plate illustrating Dr.

Buckland's important memoir f are represented above the bodies of the three
middle vertebrae, are natural, and accurately given : the smooth external sur-

face of the side of the vertebra may be traced continuing uninterruptedly

through these foramina, over the middle or nearly the middle of the centrum,

into the surface of the spinal canal.

   But the normal position of these foramina throughout the vertebral co-
lumn in all other reptiles is at the interspace of two vertebras, whence by
French anatomists these holes are termed ' trous du conjugaison.' In the

sacrum of the Oxford Megalosaur, however, it is evident that above the an-
chylosed intervertebral space a thick and strong imperforate mass of bone

ascends to the base of the spinous process, leaving it to be conjectured either

that the nerve had perforated the middle of the neurapophysis, or that these

vertebral elements had undergone in this region of the spine a change in their
usual relative position to the centrum. Previous researches into the compo-

sition and modifications of the vertebrae in the different classes of Vertebrata

soon enabled me to recognize the peculiar condition and analogies of the five an-

chylosed vertebrae of the Megalosaurus ; with a view to illustrate which I shall
premise a few observations on the different relative positions which the peri-

pheral vertebral elements may take in regard to the central part or body.

The lateral vertebral elements, or ribs, the inferior laminae or haemapophyses,

* Gcol. Trans., 2nd Series, vol. i. p. 395, pi. xlii. fig. I.  t Ibid-
--106 REPORT 1841.

 the superior laminae or neurapophyses, are all subject to such changes ; but

 the neurapophyses are much more constant in their place of attachment than
 the others. In Mammalia the ribs for the most part are joined to the inter-

 space of two centrums ; in Reptiles each pair is attached to a single centrum.
 In Fishes, and the Mosasaur among Reptiles, the hsemapophyses depend, each

 pair from its proper centrum ; in other Reptiles and Mammalia they are arti-

 culated to the interspace of two vertebrae, leaving a half-impression on each
 of the contiguous centrums. The neurapophyses present a degree of con-
 stancy in their relation to the body of the vertebra corresponding ·with the

importance of their function. In Mammalia I know of no exception to the
rule, that each neural arch is supported by a single centrum : in Birds no ex-
ception has hitherto been recorded ; but among Reptiles the Cheloniae* oiFer
in those vertebrae, in which the expanded spinous processes contribute to form

the carapace, the interesting modification analogous to those noticed in the
lateral and inferior vertebral elements, viz. a shifting of the superior laminae

from the middle of the body to the interspace of two adjoining centrums
whereby that part of the spine subject to greatest pressure is more securely
locked together, and a slight yielding or elastic property is superadded to the

support of the neural arch.

    The same modification is introduced into the long sacrum of birds ; each
neural arch is there supported by two contiguous vertebrae, the interspace
of which is opposite the middle of the base of the arch above, and the ner-
vous foramen is opposite the middle of each centrum. It is this structure,
beautifully exemplified in the sacrum of the young Ostrich, which Creative
Wisdom adopted to give due strength to the corresponding region of the
spine of a gigantic Saurian species, whose mission in this planet had ended
probably before that of the Ostrich had begun.

   The anchylosed bodies of the sacral vertebrae of the Megalosaur retain
the distinguishing characters which have been recognized in the dorsal and

caudal vertebrae, in regard to the smooth and polished surface of their middle
constricted part ; the cylindrical, or nearly cylindrical transverse contour of
this part below the lateral depression ; their expanded, thickened and rounded
articular margins, and also, though in a somewhat less degree, their relative

length as compared with their breadth and height. The three middle sacrals
are, however, somewhat shorter than the two terminal ones.

The neural arches of the first three sacral vertebras rest directly over the

irrterspaces of the subjacent bodies ; that of the fourth derives a greater pro-
portion of its support from its proper centrum ; aud that of the fifth, which
rests by its anterior extremity on a small proportion of the fourth centrum,

is extended over nearly the whole length of its own centrum, so that in the

caudal vertebrae the ordinary relations of the neural arch and centrum are again
resumed. In the four first sacral vertebrae the base of the neural arch ex-'
tends half way down the interspace of the bodies, and immediately developes
from its outer part a strong and short transverse process (broken and rounded

off in the fossil). From the base of this process the neurapophysis expands

wise cites the Chondropterygians ; ' Le9ons d'Anat. Comparee,' ed. 1836, torn. i. p. 213.

upward, forward and backward, is joined by vertical suture to similar ex-
pansions of the contiguous neurapophysis, an-d terminates above in a ridge
of bone, at right angles to the suture ; this ridge, with those of the other
neurapophyses, extends longitudinally above the transverse processes the
whole length of the sacrum, and forms the margin of the platform from which
the spinous and accessory processes are developed. The platform is further
supported by a compressed ridge of bone extended from the upper part of
the transverse process, like a buttress, to the middle of the horizontal ridge.

On each side of the buttress there is a depression, which is deepest in front.

The spinous process is not developed, as in the dorsal vertebrae, immediately
from the platform, but a shorter, vertical plate of bone, of nearly the same

longitudinal extent as the true spine, is developed on each side of, and parallel
with its base ; the height of these accessory spines in the third sacral vertebra

is three and a half inches. The true spinous process begins to expand longi-
tudinally, and when near tne summit of the accessory spines, is joined by ver-

tical siiture with the similarly expanded neighbouring spines, so that the sa-
crum is crowned by a strong continuous vertical longitudinal ridge of bone, at
least along the four first vertebrae ; the broad spine of the fifth being rounded
off anteriorly, and separated by a narrow interspace from that of the fourth.
Besides this modification of the spine, and the more normal position of the
neural arch of the fifth anchylosed vertebra, the origin of the transverse pro-
cess has been suddenly raised to the level of the spinal platform, and it is sup-
ported by two converging ridges of bone from the side of the neural arch be-
low. The origin of the transverse processes of the first sacral is also placed
higher than the three middle ones, in which the several peculiarities of struc-

ture above described are most strongly marked.

   The specimens of sacrum of the Megalosmirus in the British Museum,
and that of the Geological Society, present the same structure as that above

described in the original specimen at Oxford. Part of the fifth sacral ver-

tebra is wanting in the specimen from Dry Sandford. The rest are cha-
racterised by the same smooth and polished surface, rich brown colour, con-

traction of the middle of the body, its cylindrical form transversely, and the
longitudinal fossa below the annular part. The length of this series is one
foot six and a half inches ; the second and third sacral vertebrae are rather
shorter than the rest. The first sacral vertebra, which was not anchylosed

to the last lumbar, gives the following dimensions :

The neural arch seems not to have been co-extensive in length with the cen-

process extends obliquely upwards and backwards from each side of the arch ;

the antero-posterior diameter of the base of this process is two inches, its ver-

tical diameter one and a half incii. In the second sacral vertebra the neural

arch ha.s moved forward upon the interspace between the first and second

sacral bodies, and developes from a lower part of its base a stronger, thicker

and longer transverse process, directed outwards and forwards. The third

neural arch has its base transferred directly over the interspace of the second

and third centrums ; the diameters of the base of its transverse processes are
three inches and two and a half inches : they incline slightly backwards. The

fourth neural arch descends lower down upon the interspace between the third

and fourth centrums. The fifth neural arch, as in the Oxford specimen, ex-

tends a little way across the interspace between the fourth and fifth centrums,

but nearly resumes its ordinary place. The second and third sacral vertebrae

are not so regularly convex below in the transverse direction, but their sides

converge so as to give a slight indication of a broad obtuse ridge. The dia-

meter of the spinal canal in the first and last sacral vertebras is one inch.

   The five vertebrae are not anchylosed in a straight line, but describe a

gentle curve, with the concavity downAvards ; the series of transverse pro-

cesses or sacral ribs, forms a curved line in the opposite direction, in conse-

quence of their different positions. The summits of the anchylosed spines

being truncated, describe a curve almost parallel with that of the under part

of the vertebrae. The contour of the hinder part of the body of the present

gigantic carnivorous lizard, doubtless raised high above the ground upon the

long and strong hind-legs, must have been diffei'ent from that of any existing

Saurians. In these the relatively shorter hind-legs, being directed more or

less obliquely outwards, do not raise the under surface of the abdomen from

the ground ; it is the greater share in the suppoi't of the trunk assigned to

the hind-legs in the Megalosaur which made it requisite that, as in land

mammals, a greater proportion of the spine should be anchylosed to transfer

the superincumbent weight thi'ough the medium of the iliac bones upon the

femora.

The femur, like the teeth and vertebrae, exhibits a mixture of the charac-

ters of the Monitor and the Crocodile. It is arched in two directions, being

at first concave in front, and then behind. Its articular head is directed for-

wards, and has behind it a compressed and rather salient trochanter ; it

thickens towards the distal end, and there terminates in two unequal con-

dyles. Near its upper third it has an expansion on both the inner and the

outer side, like the one which is seen on the internal side of the femur in the

Crocodile. The femur of the Monitor is less arched. The medullary canal

is wide, which removes the Megalosaur from the Crocodiles, and indicates,

as Dr. Buckland has well shown, its aptitude for a more terrestrial life.

The ribs, which from their colour, texture, and proximity of deposit, belong

most probably to the Megalosaurus, present a double articulation with the ver-

tebral column ; the head is supported on a long and strong compressed neck,

thickest at its under part ; the tuberosity is large. One of the small cervical

false ribs is preserved, the free extremity of which gradually tapers to a point.

The scapula is a thin, slightly-bent plate, of equal breadth, except where it

is expanded and thickened towards the humeral end, but thinning off again

towards the articular margin. The chief support of the humerus seems to

have been afforded by a large and broad coracoid. The antero-posterior

diameter of one of these bones, taken across the median, thin, slightly con-

vex margin, is two feet three inches. The thickened process for the articu-

lation with the scapula has a deep and narrow notch in front, and the deep

and wide glenoid cavity for the humerus behind it ; the posterior boundary

Aof this cavity projects outwards in the form of an obtuse process.        short

but strong process projects from the anterior part of the coracoid analogous

to that which in the Varanian Monitors and most other Lizards abuts against

the epicoracoids, and which bespeaks the existence of the epicoracoids in the

Megalosaurus. The characteristic coracoid bone illustrates most unequivo-

cally the affinities of the Megalosaurus to the Lacertian group of reptiles
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

but compared with the coracoid of a Varanian Monitor, four feet nine inches

in length, it is sixteen times as large. This magnitude in a reptile, Cuvier

justly observes, is quite appalling ; for, other proportions being the same, the

Megalosaurus must have exceeded seventy feet in length.

  A long and slender bone, nearly two feet in length, most resembles the

clavicle of certain lizards, especially, as Cuvier remarks, those of the great
                   ON BRITISH FOSSIL REPTILES.                              109

Sclncus. It is slightly arcuated longitudinally, subtrihedral in the middle, flat-

tened and expanded at the two extremities. If it be really a clavicle, it forms

as characteristic an indication of the Lacertian affinities of the Megalosaurus

as the coracoid. According to the proportions of the clavicle in existing lizards,

Cuvier observes that it bespeaks an animal nearly sixty feet in length.

  A subcompressed, three-sided bone, flattened and slightly expanded at one

end, thickened and more suddenly extended transversely at the opposite end,

which formed part of a large cotyloid cavity, is most likely an ischium ; its

length is 18 inches; its breadth, at the middle of the shaft, 5 inches ; at its

articular end 9 inches, the thickness of this end being 4 inches. The ascend-

ing shaft of this bone is slightly twisted, convex and smooth on the outer side,

flat and rough on the inner side.

Other bones, not improbably belonging to the Megalosaurus, are preserved

in the British and Oxford Museums, and in the private collections of Messrs.
Holmes and Saull ; but further evidence of their Megalosaurian character

must be obtained before a description of them can be profitably applied to the

reconstruction of the skeleton of the present carnivorous Dinosaur,

  A few words, however, may be added, touching the size of the Megalosau-

rus                for it appears to me that the calculations which assign  to it a length of
                ;

60 and 70 feet are affected by the fallacy of concluding that the locomotive

extremities bore the same proportion to, and share in the support of, the body,
as they do in the small modern land lizards.

   The most probable approximation to a true notion of the actual length of
the Megalosaurus, is that which may be obtained by taking the length of the
vertebrge as the basis. The antero-posterior dimension is the most constant
which the vertebrae present throughout the spine : in most Crocodilian and

Lacertian reptiles the cervical vertebrae are a little shorter than tlie dorsal

but these are of equal length, and the caudal vertebrae maintain the same

length to very near the extremity of the tail.

   As the dorsal vertebree of the Megalosaurus agree, in the important cha-
racter of the mode of articulation of the ribs, with the Crocodiles, it may be

regarded as most probable that they also corresponded in their number. This

does not exceed 14 in recent Crocodiles, nor 16 in any of the known extinct

species ; taking, then, the latter number, and adding to it 7, the usual number
of the cervical vertebrae in Crocodiles, we may allow the Megalosaurus 23

vertebrte of the trunk.

   The length of the body of a large dorsal vertebra of the Megalosaurus in

the British Museum is 41 inches : from the analogy of the Iguanodon, in

which several dorsal vertebrae have been discovered in their natural juxta-

position, it is probable that the thickness of the intervertebral substance did

not exceed one-third of an inch : but if we multiply 23 by 5, not allowing

for the probable shortness of the cervical vertebrte, we only then attain a
length of 9 feet 7 inches. If, however, setting aside the analogy of the Me-
galosaurus to the Crocodiles in the structure of the vertebrte, we take that

species of Lacertian which it most resembles in the structure of the teeth, and
found our calculation on the number of vertebrae of the trunk in such lizard,

then, the great carnivorous Varanian Monitor of Java having 27 vertebrte

of the trunk, we do not, even calculating the same number of vertebraj to

have occupied each a space of five inches in the Megalosaurus, obtain a length
of trunk exceeding 11 feet 3 inches.

   I should consider the first calculation, or about 10 feet, to have been the
most probable natural length.

   To this we must add 1 foot 10 inches for the known length of the sacrum.
Thus 12 feet will be a fair or even a liberal allowance of length from the

occiput to the beginning of the tail. In Crocodiles the skull equals about 12

dorsal vertebrae in length. In the Java Monitor the proportion of the head is

less. In the Iguana the cranium does not exceed 6 dorsal vertebrae in length.

  We may consider therefore 5 feet, taking the Crocodile as the term of

comparison, as probabl)- not below the length of the head of the Megalosaur.

With regard to the tail, this includes between 36 and 38 vertebras in Croco-

dilians, but varies from 30 to 115 in the small existing Lacertians, in many

of which it is a prehensile organ, aiding them in climbing and other actions

suitable to their size. It is very improbable that the tail should have pre-

sented such unusual proportions in the great Saurian under consideration,

and indeed very few caudal vertebrae of the Megalosaur have been as yet

discovered, and none exceeding 4 inches in length. Allowing the Megalo-

saur to have had the same number of vertebrae as the Crocodile, and multi-

plying this number 36 by 4-^, a length of 12 feet 6 inches is thus obtained for

   Upon this mode of obtaining an idea of the bulk of the present extinct rep-
tile I am disposed to place the greatest reliance, and conceive that any error
in it is more likely to be on the side of exaggeration than of curtailment.
From the size and form of the ribs it is evident that the trunk was broader
and deeper in proportion than in modern Saurians, and it was doubtless raised

from the ground upon extremities proportionally larger and especially longer,
so that the general aspect of the living Megalosaur must have proportionally
resembled that of the large terrestrial quadrupeds of the Mammalian class
which now tread the earth, and the place of which seems to have been supplied
in the oolitic ages by the great reptiles of the extinct Dinosaurian order.

   Besides the Stonesfield slate, the remains of the Megalosaurus have been
found in the Bath oolite immediately below that slate, and in the cornbrash

above it. The other formation in which the remains of the Megalosaur
occur, next in importance to the Stonesfield slate, is the Wealden strata.

Dr. Mantell has discovered in the ferruginous clay of the Forest of Tilgate
a fine vertebra, and a portion of the femur of the Megalosaurus, 22 inches

in circumference. Many teeth have been discovered altogether of the same
form as those found by Dr. Buckland. Some fragments of the metacarpus

and metatarsus from this locality, were thicker than those of a large hippo-
potamus. Mr. Holmes, surgeon at Horsham, possesses a good caudal ver-
tebra, and some other parts of the Megalosaurus from the ferruginous sand
near Cuckfield in Sussex. Remains of the Megalosaurus occur in the Pur-
beck limestone at Swanage Bay. In some of the private collections in the
town of Malton, Yorkshire, are teeth, unquestionably belonging to the same
species as the Stonesfield Megalosaurus, ivoxaihQ oolite in the neighbourhood

of that town.

   The tooth from the New Red Sandstone of Warwick figured in the Memoir

by Messrs. Murchison and Strickland*, and referred to the Megalosaurus, be-
longs to another genus of Lacertian, more nearly allied to the PalcBosaurus

of the Bristol conglomerate.

                                            Hyi-^osaurus.

  A second well-marked genus of Dinosaurian Reptiles is founded upon a

large portion of the skeleton of the reptile to which the name at the head of
this section has been applied by its discoverer, Dr. Mantell.

    In assigning to this genus its present place in the Dinosaurian order, I
have been guided by the structure of the vertebral column, especially the

sacrum, and by the following considerations. The distinct alveoli in the jaws
of the Megalosaurus, and the resemblance of its teeth to those of two ex-
tinct Crocodilians, viz. the Argenton species and the Suchosaurus, seemed

to claim for that great carnivorous Dinosaur the next place to the Crocodi-

lian order, among which the Streptospondyliis, as has been shown, seemed to
make the closest approximation to the Megalosaurus, in the great height,

complexity and strength of the neural arch of the vertebrae. In the present
genus, which there is good reason for believing to have resembled the Lizards
more than the Crocodiles in its dental characters, an affinity to the Loricate
Sauria is manifested not only by the structure of the vertebrae and ribs com-

mon to it with other Dinosaurs, but likewise by the presence of dermal bones,

or scutes, with which the external surface was studded.
   The Hylaosaurus has not been made known like the Megalosaurus, from

detached parts of the skeleton successively discovered and analogically re-
composed, but was at once brought into the domain of Palaeontology by the
discovery of the following parts of the skeleton in almost natural juxtaposi-
tion : viz. the anterior part of the trunk, including ten of the anterior ver-
tebrae in succession, supporting a small fragment of the base of the skull
the two coracoids, the coracoid extremities of both scapulae, detached verte-
brae, several ribs more or less complete, and some remarkable parts of the
dermal skeleton, including, apparently, enormous vertical plates or spines, ar-
ranged, as is supposed, in the form of a median dorsal ridge or crest of sin-

gular dimensions.

   In the fragment of the cranium may be distinguished the pterygoid ele-

ments of the sphenoid bone, the inner margins of which touch anteriorly and
then recede as they pass backwards, leaving a heart-shaped posterior nasal
aperture, the apex of which is turned forwards. The breadth of this aper-
ture is 1 inch 3 lines : its posterior position gives another character, by which
the present Dinosaur, and probably the larger genera of the same order, re-
sembled the Crocodiles more than the Lizards.

   The bodies of the vertebrae are shorter in proportion to their breadth than
in the Megalosaurus or Iguanodon. They have not so smooth and polished

a surface as in the Megalosaurus, nor are they so contracted in the middle,
or so regularly rounded below from side to side ; a few of the anterior ver-
tebrae are somewhat flattened below, so as to present an obscurely quadrate

figure ; most of the anterior dorsals are more compressed and keel-shaped
below : the sacral and caudal vertebrae are longitudinally sulcated at their

under surface.

   The structure of the atlas and axis cannot be discerned in the Mantellian
specimen ; the second (conspicuous) cervical vertebra has its sides subcom-

pressed, its under surface flattened, and the anterior part of the slight angular
ridges separating it from the concave lateral surfaces, are produced anteriorly

into two feebly-marked tubercles. The inferior transverse processes are deve-
loped from each side of the anterior jjart of the body of the vertebra ; they

are subcircular, very slightly prominent, about 7 lines in diameter.
    In the fourth (conspicuous) vertebra, a large proportion, but not the whole,

of a costigerous transverse process is developed from each side of the anterior
112 REPORT 1841.

part of the body, with the costal surface directed obliquely outwards and for-
wards. There is a small costal surface at the side of the expanded posterior
extremity of the same vertebra, against which a part of the head of the fourth
rib abuts ; that and three of the succeeding ribs having their heads applied
over the interspace of two contiguous vertebrae, as nearly throughout the tho-
racic region in Mammalia. The lateral compression of the centrum increases
in the sixth and seventh (conspicuous) vertebrae, in which the under surface
forms an obtuse ridge ; in the eighth vertebra this surface is broader. In
none of these vertebrae is a process developed from the under surface as in the
hinder cervical and anterior dorsal vertebrae of the Crocodiles.

   The most striking character of the vertebrae of the Hylaosaurus is the
great development of the neural arch and its processes. The anterior articu-
lar processes extend (in the anterior dorsal and cervical vertebra) over half
the centrum next in front, and a broad upper transverse process is developed
from the side of the neurapophysis and along its anterior continuation : this
transverse process extends horizontally outwards, is notched anteriorly, and
contracts to an obtuse point against which the tubercle of the rib articulates
the transverse processes are flat transversely, slightly concave lengthwise, and
smooth below : they increase in length and strength as the vertebrae extend
along the trunk ; and the ribs, which they contribute to support, exhibit a still
more rapid increase : the ribs present, as in the other Dinosaurs and Croco-

diles, a bifurcated vertebral end for the double articulation above described*.

The neck and head of the rib corresponding with the seventh conspicuous ver-

tebra is 2 inches 2 lines in length ; the tubercle, or upper head, is 10 lines long

the breadth of the rib at the point of bifurcation is 1 inch 1 line. The neck
of the eighth rib has the same length as that of the seventh, but is twice as
thick and strong ; the tubercle is broader but shorter. Beyond the tubercle

the shaft of the rib is bent at right angles with the neck. This soon begins to
shorten, and the shaft of the rib to lengthen, until it becomes attached solely
to the transverse process.

   In the dorsal vertebrae the body increases in all its proportions, excepting

its length. The lateral compression now manifests itself at the upper part

of the centrum just below the neurapophysial suture ; the under surface of
the posterior dorsal and lumbar vertebra is convex transversely, but in a less

degree than in the Megalosaurus, and in some, it is obscurely carinated. The

external surface at the middle contracted part of the vertebra is moderately
smooth, but the minute striee give it a somewhat silky lustre ; it is longitu-
dinally but irregularly ridged and grooved near the articular ends. These
are both slightly concave at the centre, more slightly convex near the circum-

ference. The difference between the vertebrae of the Hylaeosaur and the bi-

concave Crocodilian vertebrae is chiefly manifested in the development of

the neural arch. The modification of this part in the cervical vertebrae has

already been mentioned. In the dorsal vertebrae each neurapophysis rises
vertically, contracting in the axis of the vertebra, expanding transversely or
outwardly, until it has attained a height equal to that of the centrum ; there it
expands into a broad and flat platform, from the middle line of which the

Abroad spine is developed. vertically compressed but sti'ong transverse pro-

    * Dr. Mantell, io his Memoir on the Tilgate Saurians, Philos. Transactions, Part ii. for 1841,
which I received while this Report was going through the press, says that " the hilobed head
and the great external expansion of the arch of the rib in all probability bears a relation to
the enormous development of the dermal spines," p. 143. But this is precisely the modifica-
tion of the skeleton in which the Hylaosaurus differs most from the existing Saurians which
possess such spines, as the Cyclura, and in which it most resembles the Iguanodon and Me-

 galosaurus.

cess is developed from the side of the neurapophysis, and is supported by a

pyramidal underprop, extending upwards and outwards from the anchylosed

base of the neurapophysis. There is a large, deep and smooth depression on

each side of the base of the transverse process. Tlie anterior surface of the

neural arch, above the anterior oblique processes, is traversed by a vertical

ridge, on each side of which there is a shallow depression*. The spinous

process is of unusual thickness, its transverse breadth at the base measures

1 inch : this modification may probably relate to the support of great dermal

spines. The spinal canal in the dorsal vertebrae is cylindrical, and expanded

at both extremities ; its diameter at the middle is 7 lines, at the expanded out-

lets 10 lines, in a posterior dorsal or lumbar vertebra. Here the bases of the

neurapophyses begin to shorten, and leave a small proportion of the upper

surface of the centrum uncovered at both ends, chiefly at the posterior end.

   The differences between the vertebras of the Hijlceosaurus and Megalo-
saurus have been already pointed out, and are further shown in the admea-

surements given above : the vertebrae of the HylcBosaurus differ from those
of the Iguanodon in their greater transverse diameter, and in the breadth of
their under part ; those of the Iguanodon are flatter vertically along their

whole sides, which converge to a narrower ridge at the under part. The

vertebrae of the Hylceosaurus differ from those of the Streptospondylus in
the sub-biconcave character of the articular ends of the centrum, and in its
comparative shortness and thickness : the separated neural arch might be
distinguished from that of the Streptospondylus by the simplicity of the sup-
porting buttress of the transverse process; and, although equal in height, yet it
is superior in the expansion and strength of the platform and spinous process.

  --Sacrum, There is a portion of a sacrum of a small or young Dinosaur

(No. 2484> Mantellian Collection), which, in the form and proportions of the
bodies of the vertebrae, most resembles the present genus, and cannot be re-
ferred to Megalosaurus or Iguanodon. It includes two entire and parts of
two other vertebral bodies, anchylosed together, and to the bases of the neu-
rapophyses ; which, as in the Megalosaurus, are transferred to the upper and
lateral 2)arts of the interspaces of the subjacent bodies. These are moderately,
but regularly, contracted in the middle and chiefly laterally, being more flat-

tened below, where likewise each is traversed by a longitudinal sulcus. At
the middle of each lateral concavity there is a vascular perforation. I am
uncertain which is the anterior part of this interesting series ; but, by the

analogy of the Megalosaurus, conclude that vertebra which supports the great-
est proportion of its neural arch, to be posterior to the adjoining one which

supports the remaining small proportion. On this basis also 1 assume that the
anterior sacral vertebra is deficient, if we may allow five to the Hylaeosaur us

to the other Dinosaurs.

   The second sacral vertebra, then, is here broken across the middle of the

body, exposing its solid minutely cellular central structure : its neural arch
is too mutilated for profitable description : its base rests nearly equally on

the second and third sacral bodies. The third neural arch, which exhibits
a similar relative position, has its base extended half -way down the inter-

space ; its strong transverse process extends outwards and forwards, and is
at first contracted, then expands both transversely and vertically, juost so in
the latter direction, and is twisted obliquely, so that the lower end is directed
downwards and forwards, and the upper and thicker end is bent obliquely
backwards, until it meets and becomes anchylosed to the anterior production
of the transverse process of the next vertebra behind : an elliptical space is
thus produced, the axis of which is nearly vertical, and into this space the
neui'al canal opens ; the nerve being transmitted over the middle of the body
of the vertebra, as in the sacrum of the Megalosaurus.

   The upper and inner part of the base of the broad, oblique transverse pro-
cess, or sacral rib, abuts against the base of the spinous process. There is
no appearance of accessory spines, such as the sacrum of the Megalosaurus

is complicated with.

the HylcEOsaurus :                           ......:. In. Lin.

The spines appeal- to be anchylosed into a continuous ridge.

  --Caudal vertebra. A proportion of the tail, to the extent of nearly six feet,

and including about twenty-six vertebrae, discovei-ed in a quarry in Tilgate
Forest in the year 1837? is preserved in the Mantellian Collection. The

transverse processes present almost Crocodilian proportions, in regard to their

length, at the anterior part of this series, and may be discerned, though dimi-

nished to mere rudiments, in the small terminal vertebrae of the series. In

the most perfect of the anterior vertebrae they are compressed vertically, but
with convex, not flattened sides, and rounded edges, presenting an elliptical
transverse section, and preserving the same breadth to their truncated extre-
mity : they extend outwards, and are slightly bent forwards : the breadth of
this vertebra between the extremities of the transverse processes is 11 inches.
The neurapophysis is curved forwards from the base of the transverse process

to form the anterior oblique process ; its length from the extremity of this

process to that of the posterior one is 3^ inches. The neurapophysis presents

a simple convex external surface to the base of the spine : the antero-poste-

rior extent of this process is two inches. The chevron bones are from four
to five inches in length near the base of the tail ; they may be distinguished,
like the transverse processes, by their convex external surface ; their base is
open, not confluent as in the Iguanodo7i, and articulated to two distinct tu-

bercles. Between these tubercles, which are placed at each end of the under
surface of the centrum, there is a longitudinal sulcus. The transverse pro-

cesses soon lose the slight anterior curve, stand straight out, decrease in
          ON BRITISH FOSSIL REPTILES.                                     115

length, and descend from the neurapophysis to the centrum as the vertebrs

approach the end of the tail.

   The chevron bones also decrease in length, but they expand in the antero-

posterior direction at their unattached and dependent extremity, M'hich is
defined by a slight convex outline. The following admeasurements give the

rate of decrease in length in the caudal vertebras, taken at intervals of six

joints :                                 In. Lines.

The sides of the slender posterior vertebrae are distinguished by a slight

median expansion below the base of the rudimental transverse jDrocess, so that

the surface, instead of being gently concave lengthwise, undulates by virtue

of the middle elevation. I have not met with this character in the corre-

sponding vertebrae of other Saurians. In the vertical direction the sides of

the centrum in the posterior caudals converge at almost a right angle to the

inferior groove. The greater breadth of the centrum, in proportion to its

height, may still be discerned in the terminal caudal vertebrae : thus in the

centrum 2 inches 2 lines long, the breadth was 1 inch 10 lines, and the

height only 1 inch 3 lines.

 --Dermal scutes. Unequivocal evidence that a dermal skeleton, analogous

to that in the recent Crocodiles, was developed in the Hylceosaurus, was af-

foi'ded by the discovery of bony scutes in the mass of vegetable matter re-
moved in clearing the portion of the skeleton first described. Some of these

detached bony plates still adhere to the caudal vertebrae, and may be observed
to decrease in size as they approach the end of the tail. From their form,

which is elliptical or circular, and from the absence of any surface indicating

the overlapping of an adjoining scute, it may be inferred, that the bony

plates in question studded in an unconnected order the skin of the Hylaeo-

saur. The diameter of the largest of these scutes does not exceed three
inches ; the smallest present a diameter of one inch. They are flat on the
under surface, convex with the summit developed into a tubercle in the smaller

specimens, but which is less prominent in the larger ones : the outer surface is

studded all over by very small tubercles : the inner surface presents the fine

decussating straight lines, already noticed in the scutes of the Goniopholis.

   By the kindness of Dr. Mantell, I have been favoured with the means of

submitting the structure of a dermal scute to microscopical examination.

The medullary canals, which are stained brown, as if with the hematosine

of the old reptile, differ from those of ordinary bone in the paucity or absence
of concentric layers. They are situated in the interspaces of straight opake

decussated filaments, which frequently seem to be cut short off close to the

medullary canals. Very fine lines may be observed to radiate from some of

the medullary canals : irregularly shaped, oblong and angular radiated cells
are scattered through most parts of the osseous tissue, but they present less
uniformity of size than do the Purkinjian cells in ordinary bone. The most

striking characteristics of the dermal bone are the long straight spicular fibres

which traverse it, and decussate each other in all directions, representing, as

it seems, the ossified ligamentous fibies of the original corium.

 --Dermal spines? On the left side of the thorax, partly overlying the left

scapula and vertebral ribs, in the large slab of stone containing the anterior

part of the skeleton, there are some large elongated, flattened pointed plates
of bone, three of which seem to follow each other in natural succession. The

length of the first of these plates is seventeen inches, the breadth of the base

five inches, equal to the antero-posterior diameter of two vertebrae : they de-

                                                 i2
--116 REPORT 1841.

crease somewhat rapidly in length, the second being fourteen inches long and
the third eleven inches long ; but slightly increase in breadth.

   These remarkable bones are regarded by Dr. Mantell* as having formed
part of a serrated fringe extended along the back of the animal, analogous to
that of the Cycliira Lizard. This ingenious suggestion carries with it so
high a degree of probability, that I had not thought of comparing the bones

in question with any other part of the skeleton, until my attention was arrested

by observing a want of symmetry in the form of the most perfect of them.
They are nearly flat, but along the middle present a slight degree of conca-

vity towards the observer, which, however, may be paralleled by a similar con-

cavity on the opposite side buried in the stone ; but the anterior or convex
margin inclines from the middle line towards the concave side. With regard
to their relative position to the rest of the skeleton, it must be observed that
the ventral surface of this is exposed ; so that the under parts of the bodies of
the vertebrae are towards the observer, and their spines imbedded in the matrix.

The coracoid and scapular arch are placed, as might be expected in a ske-

leton little disturbed and lying on its back, with their under surfaces towards
the observer, and covering, like a buckler, a portion of the vertebrae and ribs.

In this position we might look for a portion of the apparatus of the sternal or

abdominal ribs, in the hope of discerning the modifications of these variable

parts which might characterize a genus differing in many peculiarities from

other known Saurians. Now it is with the apparatus of abdominal ribs, which

present such a diversity of characters in other Saurians, that it may be use-

ful to compare the long flattened bones in question, as well as with the sup-
porting bones of a dorsal crest, in the event of a future discovery of a skeleton
or portion of skeleton of the Hylceosaurus including these bones. The objec-

tion to their being abdominal ribs, which may be founded on their great rela-

tive breadth as compared with those ribs in other Saurians, and especially
with the vertebral ribs of the Hylceosaiirus itself, deserves due consideration ;
but the same objection applies to the bones in question as compared with the
superadded spines in the Lizard with a dorsal ft-inge, or with the spines of the
vertebrte themselves in the HylcBosaiirus. For the dorsal dermal spines in
the Cyclura correspond in number with the spines of the vertebrae which sup-

port them, while the base of each of the hypothetical dermal spines of the Hy-
laeosaur extends over more than two vertebrae.

    In the Monotremata ( Ornithorhynchus and Echidna) the abdominal ribs

are as much broader than the vertebral ribs as they would be in the Hylcco-

saurus, on the costal hypothesis of the detached bony plates here suggested
and, after the close repetition, in the Ichthyosaurus, of another of the remarka-

ble deviations in those aberrant Mammals from the osteological type of their

class, viz. in the structure of their sternal and scapular arch, the reappearance
of the inonotrematous modification of the sternal ribs in the present extinct
reptile would not be surprising. The want of symmetry and the difference of
size and form, above aUuded to, in the four succeeding spine-shaped plates,
agree better with the costal than the spinous hypothesis.

    Whether the bones in question be dorsal spines or abdominal ribs, they
have evidently been displaced from their natural position in the partial disar-

ticulation of the entire skeleton prior to its immersion in the mud that has

been subsequently hardened around it; but the degree of displacement has
not been greater in the one case than in the other.

    In offering, witii due diffidence, a choice of opinions respecting the nature
of these singular bones, I have been actuated solely with the view of accele-
rating the acquisition of the true one, which, it is obvious, will be more likely

       * Geology of South-east of England, p. 323. Wonder* of Geology, vol. i. p. 402.

to be attained by the choice being present to the mind of subsequent fortu-
nate discoverers of these remains of the Hylceosaurus, than if they were solely
preoccupied by the hypothesis of the dorsal fringe. For example, it may lead
to more careful noting of the constancy or otherwise of the unsymmetrical in-
clination of the convex margin of the spine, and whether they form, or are
disposed in, pairs ; which, on the costal hypothesis, may be expected, in the

event of another skeleton being discovered.

--Scapular arch. The scapula of the Hylceosaurus* is longer and narrower

than in the Monitors and Iguanas, adhering in this respect to the Crocodilian

type, but most resembling in the shape of its blade or body, that of the genus

Scincus. It differs, however, from the scapulae of all known reptiles, and
indicates an approach to the Mammalian type, by the production of a strong
obtuse acromial ridge, separated by a deep and wide groove from the hume-
ral and coracoid articular surfaces. The blade of the scapula is long, flattened,

slightly convex on the inner and proportionally concave on the outer sur-

face : the anterior margin is convex, the posterior one concave ; the upper

extremity or base truncate, slightly convex, with the posterior angle a little

produced, the anterior angle rounded off. On the outer side of the scapula

two broad convex ridges descend and converge to form the beginning of a

thick and strong spine, at fourteen inches distance from the base ; this then
expands into the thick acromial ridge, which extends transversely, and is con-

tinued forwards as a long subprismatic process from the anterior angle of

the head of the scapula. This process, which appears likewise to be present

in the scapula of the Iguanodon, perhaps also in the Megalosaurus, is broken

off in the present specimen about four inches from the neck of the scapula,

with which it forms a right angle. The acromion is perforated at the base of

its anterior prolongation by a foramen analogous to the supraspinal one in the

scapula of the Edentate Mammalia. Besides the scapulae preserved in the
connected part of the skeleton, there is, in the Manteliiau Museum, a nearly
entire and detached scapula of larger size, discovered, in connexion with many

other bones of the skeleton, in a layer of blue clay near Bolney in Sussex,

and indicating the connected part of the skeleton first discovered in 1832 to
have belonged to an immature individual. The dimensions of this scapula

ai"e as follows :                    In. Lines.

The coracoids present a much more simple form than in the Megalosaurus,

and resemble those of the Scink and Chameleon, thus deviating in their great

breadth, like the coracoids of the Enaliosaurs, from the Crocodilian type. In

the portion of the skeleton the right coracoid is slightly bent out of place and

thrust under the left one ; and there is no trace of a sternal or entosternal bone
in their interspace. The median margin of the coracoid describes an unin-

 terrupted and full convex curve commencing at the angle dividing it from the
 scapular articular surface ; but it is separated by a concavity or emargination
 from tiie articular surface for the humerus. It is perforated by a moderate
 sized elliptical canal, about two inches from the humeral articulation, and in
 this respect resembles the same bone in the Iguana, Monitors and Lizards,
 and differs from the Scinks and Chameleons. The antero-posterior extent of

 the coracoid in the connected portion of skeleton is eight inches ; its trans-
 verse diameter five inches.

 are figured by Dr. Mantell in the Memoir of 184'1.

   --Tteth ofthe Hylccosaur ? With regard to the Hylceosaurus Dr. Mantell ob-

 serves, in his latest geological work, " the teeth are unknown ; but in the quar-
 ries where the bones of that reptile were discovered, I have found teeth of a
 very peculiar form, which appear to have belonged to a reptile, and are en-
 tirely distinct from those of the Megalosaurus, Iffuanodon,Crocodi\e and Ple-
 siosaurus, whose remains occur in the Tilgate strata*." The form and struc-
 ture of these teeth, which will be presently described, deviate too much from
 those of the Crocodilian family to make at all probable a reference of them
 to the genera Poikilopleuron, Streptospondylus, or Cetiosaur, which are much
 more closely allied to the Crocodilians than is the Hylseosaur. In the 'Geology

 of the South-east of England,' Dr. Mantell attributes these teeth, on the author-

 ity of M.Boue, to the Cylindricodon, a name by which Dr. Jager distinguishes
 one of the species of his genus ^Phyiosaurus.' I have been favoured by Dr. Jager

 with one of the bodies supposed to be the teeth of the Cylindricodon of the
 Wirtemberg Keuper, but it is merely the cast of a cylindrical cavity, consist-
 ing entirely of that mineral substance, without a trace of dental structure.

 The difference of form between the Wealden teeth now under consideration,

 and those on which the Phytosaurus cylindricodon of Jager was founded, is

pointed out in detail in my Odontography, and has been likewise appreciated
by the estimable Palaeontologist, M. Fischer de Waldheim, by whom their re-

 semblance to certain Saurian teeth from the Ural Mountains, belonging to the

genus Rhopalodon\, is indicated. From these teeth, however, the presumed

Hyteosaurian teeth differ in having thick and flat instead of serrated coronal
margins. The following is Dr. Mantell's original description of the teeth in

question :

    " These teeth are about an inch and a quarter in length, and commence
with a subcylindrical shank, which gradually enlarges into a kind of shoulder,
terminating in an obtuse angular apex, the margins of which are more or less
worn, as if the teeth had been placed alternately so as to meet at their edges,
as in pi. ii. fig. 3. They are obscurely striated longitudinally, and have a
thick coat of enamel : the crown of the tooth is solid, but the shank is more
or less hollow. All the specimens appear as if they had been broken off" close
to the jaw; but they may have been separated by necrosis occasioned by the

pressure of the supplementary teeth J."

   The following is the result of a microscopical examination of these teeth.
The tooth consists of a body of dentine covered by a thick coating of clear
structureless enamel, and surrounding a small central column of true bone,
consisting of the ossified remains of the pulp, which presents the usual cha-
racters of the texture of the bone in the higher reptiles. The dentine differs,
like that of existing Lacertians, from the dentine of the Iguanodon in the en-
tire absence of the numerous medullary canals which form so striking a cha-

racteristic of the more gigantic Wealden reptile. The main calcigerous tubes
are characterized by the slight degree of their primary inflections ; they are
continued in an unusually direct course from the pulp-cavity to the outer sur-

face of the dentine, at nearly right angles with that surface, but slightly in-

clined towards the expanded summit of the tooth. They are chiefly remarka-
ble for the large relative size of their secondary branches, which diverge from
the trunks in irregular and broken curves, the concavity being always to-
wards the pulp-cavity. In most parts of the tooth, the number of these

branches obscures even the thinnest sections.

   The ossified pulp exhibits the parallel concentric layers of the ossified mat-
ter surrounding slender medullary canals, and interspersed with irregular el-

--liptical radiated cells.
   Jaw of the Hylceosaurus? No.g^^^s' i" *^^^ Mantellian Collection, is a por-

tion of the right ramus of the lower jaw, with characters distinguishing it from
that of any other known Saurian; as, for example, its degree of curvature, in-
dicating the lower jaw to have been bent down in an unusual degree, and the
remarkable inequality of its external surface. This fragment is about three
inches long, one inch seven lines deep at the hind part, and one inch five lines
deep at the fore-part ; flattened and smooth at the inner side, but having the
outer side raised by the termination of a strong angular ridge at its lower and
hinder part, and by a rough convex longitudinal ridge extending along its
upper part ; the surface of the jaw being concave above and below this ridge.
The lower margin is thick and convex ; the upper one is formed by a regular
series of pretty close-set sockets, with the internal alveolar wall broken away,
displaying their partitions ; but with the outer wall entire, thin and slightly

crenate at its upper margin.

   At the hind part of tliis fragment the anterior extremity of the opercular

piece is preserved ; the rest is formed exclusively by the dentary piece : the
area of the wide conical cavity in the interior of the jaw is exposed at the

Aback part of the fragment ; its apical termination is near the fore part.

succession of large vascular canals open obliquely forwards in the concavity

above the upper oblique longitudinal ridge. The whole of the outer surface

is minutely ridged and punctate.

   The depth of the sockets bears a smaller proportion to that of the jaw than
in modern Lacertians or Crocodiles, being about one-fourth of that depth :
the partitions of the sockets, which are very regular in their breadth and
depth, though they are more prominent than in the pleurodont Lizards, yet
exhibit a fractured margin ; there is no trace of a smooth natural surface of
the bone in the interspace of the sockets; and at the part where the inner

wall has been least mutilated, it nearly completes the socket and incloses the
long and slender fang of the tooth. Whence, I conclude, that the entire jaw
of the extinct reptile would have exhibited a series of true sockets, not de-
pressions merely, as in the pi'esent mutilated fragment, and that it would

have agreed with the Megalosaurus in presenting the thecodont mode of at-

tachment of the teeth.

   The crowns of all the teeth are broken off"; the small sockets of reserve,
exposed at the inner side of the base of the old sockets, do not contain any
evidence of the species to which this fossil has belonged. In the absence of

this characteristic part of the tooth, an element in guiding our choice between
the Iguanodon and HylcEosuurus is given by the breadth of the interspaces
of tiie sockets ; these must bear relation to the breadth of the crowns of the

teeth, if we suppose that they were in contact throughout the series, as in

Lacertians. Now the teeth of the Iguanodon, and those which I have re-

ferred to the HylcEosaurus, diff"er in a marked degree in the breadth of the
--120 REPORT 1841.

crown. The complicated and expanded crown of the Iguanodon's tooth is

supported on a narrower stem ; and the stems or fangs, if the crowns were
in contact without overlapping, must have been separated by interspaces of

proportional breadth, viz. twice their own breadth ; but the thickness of the
crown of the tooth of the Iguanodon renders it very unlikely that they did

overlap each other. Now the crowns of the teeth of the Hylaeosaur are ex-

panded to such an extent, as, if in contact to require an interspace of the fangs,
not broader than the fangs themselves; and the interspaces of the fangs in
the fragment of jaw under consideration correspond with crowns of this
breadth. The fangs of the teeth in the Iguanodon are conical, and more or
less angular ; in the teeth presumed to belong to the Hyleeosaur the fangs are
cylindrical ; the sockets in the present fragment correspond with the latter
form.

   In my Odontography*, I adopted the opinion of Dr. Mantellf respecting

the present fossil ; but subsequent examination and consideration of its cha-

racters have led me to a different conclusion. It might, nevertheless, be
urged that the teeth of the young Iguanodon may exhibit such modifications

as would affect the validity of the objections here offered ; but these, I think,
establish the greater probability that the jaw in question originally contained
teeth of the form of those that I have referred to the HyloEosaurus.

    The remains of the Hylaosaurus have been discovered in the Wealden
formation in the following localities : Tilgate Forest, Bolney and Battle.

    The bones of an enormous reptile, successively discovered in tho Wealden
strata by Dr. Mantell, interpreted by their discoverer with the aid of Cuvier
and CliftJ, named Iguanodon by Conybeare§, lastly found in juxtaposition
to the extent of nearly half the skeleton, in the green-sand quarries of Mr.

Benstead, offer not the least marvellous or significant evidences of the inha-

bitants of the now temperate latitudes during the earlier oolitic periods of the

formation of the earth's crust.

    With vertebrae subconcave at both articular extremities, having, in the
dorsal region, lofty and expanded neural arches, and doubly articulated ribs,
and characterized in the sacral region by their unusual number and compli-
cation of structure ; with a Lacertian pectoral arch and unusually large bones
of the extremities excavated by large medullary cavities and adapted for ter-

--restrial progression ; the Iguanodon was also distinguished by teeth, resem-

bling in shape those of the Iguana, but in structure difiering from the teeth of
every other known Reptile, and unequivocally indicating the former existence,
in the Dinosaurian Order, of a gigantic representative of the small group of
living lizards which subsist on vegetable substances.

   Of this remarkable Reptile, the results of personal examination of almost

a'l the recognisable remains that have hitherto been collected in public or pri-
vate museums, are here given.

  --Teeth. The value of the ordinary external characters of the teeth of the

oviparous Vertebrata has never perhaps been placed in so striking a point of
view as in the leading steps to the discovery of the Iguanodon, which cannot
be better recounted than in the words of Dr. Mantell.

After noticing the ordinary organic remains whicli characterize the sand-

stone of the Tilgate Forest, and his discovery, in the summer of 1822, of other

teeth distinguished by novel and remarkable characters, the indefatigable ex-

plorer of the Wealden proceeds to state*,

   " As these teeth were distinct from any that had previously come under my

notice, I felt anxious to submit them to the examination of persons whose

knowledge and means of observation were more extensive than my own. I

therefore transmitted specimens to some of the most eminent naturalists in

this country and on the continent. But although my communications were

acknowledged with that candour and liberality which constantly characterizes

the intercourse of scientific men, yet no light was thrown upon the subject,

except by the illustrious Baron Cuvier, whose opinions will best appear by the

following extract from the correspondence with which he honoured me :

" ' Ces dents me sont certainement inconnues ; elles ne sont point d'un ani-

mal carnassier, et cependant je crois qu'elles appartiennent, vu leur peu de

complication, leur dentelure sur les bords, et la couche mince d'email qui les

revet, a I'ordre des reptiles ; a I'apparence exterieure on pourrait aussi les

prendre pour des dents de poissons, analogues aux tetrodons, ou aux diodons;

mais leur structure interieure est fort difFerente de celles-la. N'aurions-nous

pas ici un animal nouveau, un reptile herbivore ? et de meme qu'actuelle-

ment chez les mammiferes terrestres, c'est parmi les herbivores que Ton trouve

memeles especes a plus grande taille, de  aussi chez les reptiles d'autrefois,

alors qu'ils etaient les seuls animaux terrestres, les plus grands d'entr'eux ne

se seraient-ils point nourris de vegctaux ? Une partie des grands os que vous

possedez appartiendrait a cet animal unique, jusqu'a present, dans son genre.

Le temps cowfirmera ou iwfirmera cette idee, puisqu'il est impossible qu'on ne

trouve pas un jour une partie de la squelette reunie a des portions de ma-

choires portant des dents. C'est ce dernier objet surtout qu'ij s'agit de re-

chercher avec le plus de perseverance.'

   " These remarks," Dr. Mantell proceeds to say, " induced me to pursue my

investigations with increased assiduity, but hitherto they have not been at-

tended with the desired success, no connected portion of the skeleton having

been discovered. Among the specimens lately collected, some, however,

were so perfect, that I resolved to avail myself of the obliging oifer of Mr.

Clift (to whose kindness and liberality I hold myself particularly indebted),

to assist me in comparing the fossil teeth with those of the recent Lacertae in
the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. The result of this examina-

tion proved highly satisfactory, for in an Iguana which Mr. Stutchbury had

prepared to present to the College, we discovered teeth possessing the form

and structure of the fossil specimens."

The important difference which the fossil teeth presented in the form of

their grinding surface was afterwards pointed out by Cuvierf , and recognised

by Dr. Mantell J, and the combination of this dental distinction with the ver-
tebral and costal characters, which prove the Iguanodon not to have belonged

to the same group of Saurians as that M'hich includes the Iguana and other

irvodern lizards, rendered it highly desirable to ascertain, by the improved
modes of investigating dental structure, the actual amount of correspondence

between the Iguanodon and Iguana in this respect. This I have endeavoured

to do in my general description of the Teeth of Reptiles §, from which the

following account is abridged.

    The teeth of the Iguaiiodon, though resembling most closely those of the
 Iguana, do not present an exact magnified image of them, but differ in the
 greater relative thickness of the crown, its more complicated external surface,
 and, still more essentially, in a modification of the internal structure, by which
 the Iguanodon equally deviates from every other known reptile.

    As in the Iguana, the base of the tooth is elongated and contracted, while
 the crown is expanded, and smoothly convex on the inner side ; when first

 formed it is acuminated, compressed, its sloping sides serrated, and its external
surface traversed by a median longitudinal ridge, and coated by a layer of
enamel, but beyond this point the description of the tooth of the Iguanodon
indicates characters peculiar to that genus. In most of the teeth that have
 hitherto been found, three longitudinal ridges traverse the outer surface of
the crown, one on each side of the median primitive ridge ; these are sepa-
rated from each other and from the serrated margins of the crown by four
wide and smooth longitudinal grooves. The relative width of these grooves
varies in different teeth ; sometimes a fourth small longitudinal ridge is deve-

loped on the outer side of the crown. The marginal serrations, which, at first
sight, appear to be simple notches, as in the Iguana, present under a low mag-
nifying power the form of transverse ridges, themselves notched, so as to re-
semble the mammillated margins of the unworn plates of the elephant's grinder:
slight grooves lead from the interspaces of these notches upon the sides of
the marginal ridges. These ridges or dentations do not extend beyond the
expanded part of the crown : the longitudinal ridges are continued further
down, especially the median ones, which do not subside till the fang of the
tooth begins to assume its subcylindrical farm. The tooth at first increases

both in breadth and thickness ; it then diminishes in breadth, but its thick-
ness goes on increasing ; in the larger and fully formed teeth, the fang de-

creases in every diameter, and sometimes tapers almost to a point. The

smooth unbroken surface of such fangs indicates that they did not adhere to
the inner side of the maxillae, as in the Iguana, but were placed in separate
alveoli, as in the Crocodile and Megalosaur : such support would appear, in-
deed, to be indispensable to teeth so worn by mastication as those of the
Iguanodon.

   The apex of the tooth soon begins to be worn away, and.it would appear,
by many specimens, that the teeth were retained until nearly the whole of the
crown had yielded to the daily abrasion. In these teeth, however, the deep

excavation of the remaining fang plainly bespeaks the progress of the suc-

cessional tooth prepared to supply the place of the worn out grinder. At the

earlier stages of abrasion a sharp edge is maintained at the external part of
the tooth by means of the enamel which covers that surface of the crown
the prominent ridges upon that surface give a sinuous contour to the middle
of the cutting edge, whilst its sides are jagged by the lateral serrations: the
adaptation of this admirable dental instrument to the cropping and commi-
nution of such tough vegetable food as the Clathrurice and similar plants,
which are found buried with the Iguanodon, is pointed out by Dr. Buckland,
with his usual felicity of illustration, in his ' Bridgewater Treatise,' vol.i. p. 246.

   When the crown is worn away beyond the enamel, it presents a broad and

nearly horizontal grinding surface, and now another dental substance is brought
into use to give an inequality to that surface ; this is the ossified remnant of

the pulp, which, being firmer than the surrounding dentine, forms a slight
transverse ridge in the middle of the grinding surface : the tooth in this stage
has exchanged the functions of an incisor for that of a molar, and is prepared
to give the final compression, or comminution, to the coar"sely divided vege-
table matters.
ON BRITISH FOSSIL. REPTILES.  123

    The marginal edge of the incisive condition of the tooth and the median
ridge of the molar stage are more effectually established by the introduction
 of a modification into the texture of the dentine, by which it is rendered softer
than in the existing Iguans and other reptiles, and more easily Avorn aAvay

 this is effected by an arrest of the calcifying process along certain cylindrical
tracts of the pulp, which is thus continued, in the form of medullary canals,
analogous to those in the soft dentine of the Megatherium's grinder, from the
central cavity, at pretty regular intervals, parallel with the calcigerous tubes,

nearly to the surface of the tooth. The medullary canals radiate from the in-
ternal and lateral sides of the pulp-cavity, and are confined to the dentine

forming the corresponding walls of the tooth : their diameter is f^th of an

inch : they are separated by pretty regular intervals equal to from six to eight

of their own diameters ; they sometimes divide once in their course. Each
medullary canal is surrounded by a clear space ; its cavity was occupied in
the section described by a substance of a deeper yellow colour than the rest

of the dentine.

    The calcigerous tubes present a diameter of ^^^^ffli of an inch, with inter-
spaces equal to about four of their diameters. At the first part of their course,

near the pulp-cavity, they are bent in strong undulations, but afterwards pro-
ceed in slight and regular primary curves, or in nearly straight lines to the

periphery of the tooth. When viewed in a longitudinal section of the tooth,

the concavity of the primary curvature is turned towards the base of the tooth
the lowest tubes are inclined towards the root, the rest have a general direc-
tion at right angles to the axis of the tooth ; the few calcigerous tubes, which
proceed vertically to the apex, are soon worn away, and can be seen only in
a section of the apical part of the crown of an incompletely developed tooth.

The secondary undulations of each tooth are regular and very minute. The

branches, both primary and secondary, of the calcigerous tubes are sent off
from the concave side of the main inflections ; the minute secondary branches
are remarkable at certain parts of the tooth for their flexuous ramifications,
anastomoses, and dilatations into minute calcigerous cells, which talce place
along nearly parallel lines for a limited extent of the course of the main tubes.

The appearance of interruption in the course of the calcigerous tubes, occa-
sioned by this modification of their secondary branches, is represented by the
irregularly dotted tracts in the figure. This modification must contribute,
with the medullary canals, though in a minor degree, in producing that ine-.
quality of texture and of density in the dentine, which renders the broad and
thick tootli of the Iguanodon more efficient as a triturating instrument.

   The enamel which invests the harder dentine, forming the outer side of the
tooth, presents the same peculiar dirty brown colour, when viewed by trans-

mitted light, as in most other teeth : very minute and scarcely perceptible un-
dulating fibres, running vertically to the surface of the tooth, is the only struc-
ture I have been able to detect in it.

   The remains of the pulp in the contracted cavity of the completely formed
tooth are converted into a dense but true osseous substance, characterized by
minute elliptical radiated cells, whose long axis is parallel with tlie plane of
tiie concentric lamellae, which surround the few and contracted medullary

canals in this substance.

   The microscopical examination of the structure of the Iguanodon's teeth

thus contributes additional evidence of the perfection of their adaptation to

the offices to whicii their more obvious characters had indicated them to have
been destined.

   To preserve a trenchant edge, a partial coating of enamel is applied ; and,
--124 REPORT 1841.

that the thick body of the tooth might be worn away in a more regularly ob-

lique plane, the dentine is rendered softer as it recedes from the enameled

edge by the simple contrivance of arresting the calcifying process along cer-

tain tracts of the inner wall of the tooth. When attrition has at length ex-

hausted the enamel, and the tooth is limited to its function as a grinder, a

third substance has been prepared in the ossified remnant of the pulp to add

to the efficiency of the dental instrument in its final capacity. And if the

following reflections were natural and just after a review of the external cha-

racters of the dental organs of the Iguanodon, their truth and beauty become

still more manifest as our knowledge of their subject becomes more particu-

lar and exact :

" In this curious piece of animal mechanism we find a varied adjustment of

all parts and'proportions of the tooth, to the exercise of peculiar functions,

attended by compensations adapted to shifting conditions of the instrument,

during different stages of its consumption. And we must estimate the works

of nature by a different standard from that which we apply to the productions

of human art, if we can view such examples of mechanical contrivance, united
with so much economy of expenditure, and with such anticipated adaptations

to varying conditions in their application, without feeling a profound convic-

tion that all this adjustment has resulted from design and high intelligence."

 --Head. Two fragments of jaw with alveoli, in the Mantellian Collection,

are referred by its founder to the Iguanodon : in neither of them, unfortu-

nately, is a tooth with the characteristic crown preserved : the size of these

specimens proves them to have belonged, if to this genus, then to young in-

dividuals. The smaller fragment is described in this Report under the head

of Hylceosaurus, on account of the cylindrical, equal, and straight form of the

remaining fangs. These parts correspond with the fangs of the teeth which I

suppose to belong to the Hylaosaurus, rather than with those of the Igua-

nodon, which are angular, curved, taper towards a point, and support crowns

so expanded, as to require greater intervals between their fangs than in the

to the Iguanodon, indicative of a peculiarity of the joint of the lower jaw as
remarkable as the structure of the teeth, and correlated to their masticatory

uses ? " Two lateral processes, or alcE, pass off obliquely, and are small in

proportion to the size of the column; on placing these bones beside the os

tympani of an Iguana, we at once perceive that the relative proportions of

these parts are reversed ; for in the recent animal the pillar is small and the

lateral processes large. From the great size of the body of the fossil, and the

extreme thinness of its walls, the tympanic cellulcB must have been of consi-
derable magnitude, and have constituted a large portion of the auditory cavi-
ties. PI. ii. fig. 1., (fig. 5 is meant,) accurately represents the most perfect

specimen in my cabinet ; it is 6 inches high, and 5| inches wide at the

   Vertebral Column. The vertebrae of the Iguanodon have their bodies ter-
minated by flat or slightly concave articular surfaces*, and their sides flat or

slightly convex vertically, moderately concave lengthwise or in the axis of
the vertebra ; the sides converge more or less towards the under surface,
and the body accordingly presents more or less the form of a wedge, with its
edge obtuse or flattened in the dorsal vertebras, but slightly concave, and with
its anterior and posterior angles truncated in the caudal vertebrae f. The con-
tour of the terminal surfaces is nearly circular, with the vertical slightly exceed-
ing the transverse diameter. The neural arch of the dorsal vertebrae presents
the complicated exterior, the great height and superior expansion, which cha-
racterize these vertebrae in other Dinosaurs : the base of each neurapophysis

equals^ or nearly equals, the antero-posterior extent of the centrum, but im-
mediately contracts in this direction from the posterior margin, which then
curves backwards as it inclines towards the opposite neurapophysis, and the
conjoined laminae are developed beyond the posterior end of the centrum

to an extent varying in the different regions of the spine. In the dorsal ver-
tebras the bases of the neurapophyses are developed transversely inwards, so
as to meet and join each other below the spinal canal : the haemapophyses pre-
sent an analogous structure through a great part of the tail, the bases of each
pair, as well as the apices, being united together, and the chevron bones, thus
formed, are perforated instead of being notched for the passage of the great

blood-vessels. The neurapophyses are commonly anchylosed to the centrum,
with a persistent trace of the suture. The transverse processes are straight,
and of great length in the vertebrae from the middle of the trunk, indicating

there a considerable expanse of the abdominal cavity, adapted for the lodge-

ment of the capacious viscera of a herbivorous feeder. The spinous processes

rise to a considerable height in the dorsal, as well as in the anterior caudal

vertebrae. The exterior surface of the vertebrae is impressed with fine stri-
ations, which are mostly longitudinal in the centrum ; so that fragments may

thus be distinguished from the characteristically smooth and polished vertebrae
of the 3Iegalosaur%is. The antero-posterior diameter of the largest vertebrae

met with any specimen of a cervical vertebra ; the comparatively small frac-

tured vertebra, Nos. gl^r ^"^ 2%%' " ^^i^ of the Iguanodoti" Mantell.
Catal., is an ordinary, or more posterior, cervical vertebra of a large Croco-

dilian Reptile, which, if not belonging to the Poikilopleuron, indicates a spe-

cies distinguishable from all other known Saurians*. The large cervical ver-
tebrte with ball-and-socket articular surfaces, agreeing with the Iguanodon
in size, have been shown to have these surfaces the reverse in position to
those in the Iguanag and modern Saurians, and to belong to the genus Strep-
tospondylus. The desirable knowledge, therefore, of the anatomy of that
region of the spine in the Iguanodon, which in other Saurians is usually
distinguished by its well-marked and varied characters, remains to be ac-

quired.

  --Costal or dorsal vertebr(B\ Towards the middle or anterior part of this re-

gion tlie bodies of the vertebree are laterally compressed, and meet below at
an obtuse ridge. Through, apparently, a considerable proportion of the dor-

sal region of the spine, the neurapophyses rise vertically to a height equal to
that of the centrum, and expand into a broad and strong platform, the upper
surface of which is slightly concave transversely, and ai'ched from behind
downwards and forwards in a regular curve ; this platform is supported by a
strong vertical buttress on each side, and sends upwards from the whole of

its middle line a thick, broad and high spinous process. Two oblique, flat,

articular processes look downwards and outwards from the posterior angles
of the platform; and the corresponding anterior oblique processes, having
their flat articular surfaces looking upwards and inwards, and inclining to
each other at a right angle, terminate the contracted anterior part of the plat-
form, and do not project beyond it as two distinct processes separated by a
median fissure. They are not continued beyond the anterior end of the body
of the vertebrae, and consequently the posterior processes overhang the hinder

   A* portion of this vertebra is alluded to at p. 137, and figured at pi. ix., fig. 1, of Dr. Man-

tell's Memoir on the Iguanodon, pubhshed in the Philosophical Transactions for the present
year, 1841, as the " atlas of a young Iguanodon ;" its position iu the neck has been apparently
determined by the resemblance of the cast of calcareous spar, which fills up the spinal canal,
to the medulla oblongata. This resemblance arises from the expansion of the open ends of
the canal ; in which expansions, in the recent Crocodile, the contained spinal chord does not,
however, in the least degi-ee participate. The longitudinal fissure in the cast is due to a cor-
responding ridge of bone projecting from the inner surface of the contiguous wall of the spinal
canal ; doubtless giving attachment to the dura mater of the chord, but not impressing the
chord itself. The external surface of the vertebra exhibits an upper and a lower transverse
process for the attachment of a bilobed cervical rib, which unequivocally demonstrates it not
to agree with the Lacertian type of structure.

   t In the Memoir in the Philosophical Transactions, 1841, above quoted, Dr. Mantell says,
" The usual characters of the dorsal and caudal vertebra; of the Iguanodon have been pointed

out in my former works," and refers to the ' Fossils of Tilgate Forest,' and the ' Geology of

the South-east of England,' p. 136. I have again, therefore, carefully perused the passages
in which the structure of the vertebrae from the Wealden strata is alluded to in those valu-

able works, in the hope that the present tedious section of my Report might be cancelled

but they leave the same doubt, which their first perusal occasioned, as to whether the author
intended to attribute to the vertebra; of the Iguanodon the characters of those of the second
system of Wealden vertebrae, viz. Cetiosauriis ; or those of the fourth system, viz. Strepto-
spondylus. See Geology of the South-east of England, p. 306. M. H. v. Meyer adopts the
former, or the Cetiosaurian ijpe, for his characters of the Iguanodon's vertebrfe, from the
works to which Dr. Mantell refers. The six caudal vertebrae of the Iguanodon described in
the Memoir of 1841, are referred to, in the ' Geology of the South-east of England,' at the
conclusion of the account of the Hylceosaurus, and the accomphshed author there states, " The
bodies of these vertebraj, like those of the newly-discovered reptile, are shghtly concave at
both extremities," which is one of the characters whereby they might l)e distinguished from

the vertebra; of the Cefiosaurus.

 surface of the centrum in order to rest upon the oblique processes of the ver-
 tebra next behind. In the anterior dorsal vertebraa the body supports a large
 and well-marked articular surface on each side, for the head of the rib ; and
 a long and strong transverse process is developed from each neurapophysis
 against the end of which the tubercle of the rib abuts, as in the Crocodile.

 In the hinder costal vertebrje the long transverse process is gradually nar-
 rowed to its extremity, which is abruptly truncated, and has a right-angled
 notch at the anterior part ; the curtailed neck of the rib, no longer expanded
 into a head or joined to the body of the vertebra, is fitted into this notch,
 and the broad and flat surface; at right angles to the neck, is adapted to the
 extremity of the transverse process.

   We seek in vain, in the existing Iguana, for such modes of articulation of

 the ribs as have here been described, while they are common to Crocodiles with
 the Dinosaurs. The fact of the complete inclosure of the spinal canal by

 the meeting and confluence of the bases of the neurapophyses beneath it,

was first brought to my attention by the appearances in the body of a dorsal

 vertebra of the great Horsham Iguanodon, in the collection of Mr. Holmes.
 This centrum, which measures 4|- inches in length and 5 inches across its

 articular extremity, presented only a slight trace of the impression of the
 spinal canal at the anterior part of its upper surface, the rest being occujjied

 by a slightly concave, continuous, rough articular surface. The deficiency
 of this vertebra was supplied by a fine specimen in Mr. SauU's collection of
the separate neural arch of a dorsalVertebra of a corresponding size, which
seemed to have been detached from a natural articulation. I saw with much
interest that the bases of the neurapophyses met and joined each other below

the spinal canal along the posterior half of their longitudinal extent, present-
ing at their under part a continuous slightly convex surface, which must have

left a corresponding concave rough articular surface upon the upper part of
the centrum, like that exhibited by the Horsham vertebral body. The base
of each neui'apophysis, which is longer than it is wide, describes a slight
curve, convex in the antero-posterior direction, downwards or towards the
centrum. The spinal canal is nearly cylindrical, very slightly expanded at the
two extremities ; its diameter 1 inch 5 fines. The chief buttress of the spinal
platform rises from the posterior and outer part of the base of the neurapo-
physis, and ascends almost vertically, slightly inclining forwards ; it is com-
pressed, with its plane transverse to the axis of the vertebra ; it expands as
it blends with the under part of the broad platform, half-way between the
anterior and posterior boundaries of that remarkable part of the neurapophy-

Asis. second buttress rises from the anterior part of the base of the neura-

pophysis, and ascends vertically to the upper and outer end of the anterior
oblique processes. The base of the transverse process is situated above the
converging point of the two buttresses. In the interspace of the two but-
tresses of the anterior dorsal vertebrae there is a large oval articular surface,
convex at the anterior and concave at the posterior part, which has aff'orded a
lodgement to the head of an enormous rib. The oblique or articular processes,
directed as described in the general observations on the vertebra of the Igua-
nodon, converge and meet at nearly a right angle. There is a wide depression
at the posterior broad part of the base of the spine, and a wide and deep fossa
between the posterior buttress and the posterior oblique process. The base of
tlie spine, as it extends forwards along the middle of the broad platform, de-
scends with a graceful curve to the interspace of the anterior oblique pro-
cesses. The platform recedes on each side from the base of the broad spine
with a regular concavity to its plane ; its surface is coarsely striated trans-

versely.

The spinous process is broken off near its base in this specimen, which is

otherwise remarkably entire, considering that it was washed out of the sub-

merged beds of the Wealden and cast on the south shore of the Isle of Wight.

It was found near Culver Cliff.

The characters thus obtained from two different parts of the vertebrae of

two Iguanodons from distant localities, certified to belong to that genus from

the association of one of the parts, viz. the vertebral centrum, with many other

characteristic bones of that reptile, have their value increased from the cir-
cumstance of the obscure and unsatisfactory manner in which the vertebral

characters are exhibited in the celebrated specimen from the Maidstone

quarry. The eight vertebrae originally forming a continuous series in this

specimen are from about the middle of the back ; the antero-posterior dia-
meter of each is 3^ inches. Little more can be determined from these or from
the detached and crushed dorsal vertebrae in this specimen, except the flatten-

ing of the sides of the vertebrae and their convergence to the lower surface,

the slight concavity of both articular extremities, the height of the neural
arch, and the strength and length of the transverse and spinous processes.

   With the evidence afforded by the previously described specimens, the cha-
racters afforded by the following detached vertebrae from the Tilgate strata may

with confidence be applied to the further elucidation of the osteology of the
Iguanodon.

measures, from its under surface to the posterior part of the base of the
spinous process, 8 inches. The broad and high neural arch is anchylosed
with the centrum, but the nearly straight line of suture is indicated by nume-
rous puckered rugae and striae. The transverse process extends from the side
of the neurapophysis ; its base is vertically oval, measuring 21 inches by 2
inches. The neurapophysis expands above this surface into a broad plat-
form, with a thick i-ough external free border, probably fi'actured. The plat-
form is supported by a buttress-like ridge, rising vertically from the posterior
angle of the base of the neurapophysis, and expanding as it ascends to blend
with the under part of the overhanging platform. Behind this buttress-is a

wide and deep depression, and the neurapophysis extends backwards to form

the posterior articular processes which project 1^ inch beyond the hind sur-

face of the centrum. The antero-posterior extent of the neurapophysial plat-

form is 6 inches ; the dimensions of the oval articular surfaces of the oblique

processes are 2 inches by 2^ inches ; the inferior margins of the posterior

Aprocesses are separated by a groove.    smaller anterior ridge extends along

the anterior part of the neurapophysis. The base of the spinous process ex-

tends from the posterior triangular interspace of the oblique processes forwards

and downwards along the curve of the supporting platform ; the thickness of

the spine, which is 1 inch at the posterior part of the base, gradually dimi-
nishes towards the fore part of the vertebra. The anterior oblique processes

form the sides of an angular depression in front of the base of the spine.

The spinal platform of the Iguanodon differs from that of the Megalosau-

rus in its greater relative antero-posterior extent, arising from its being ex-
tended further back ; the platform is also raised higher above the centrum.

^.No.      Mantellian Collection, is a dorsal vertebra, posterior in situation

to the preceding, and from an individual of the same size. The neural arch
is anchylosed, but the sutural line is obvious. The surface for the head of the

rib on the side of the neurapophysis is smaller, and a transverse process begins
to be developed above that surface, throwing its aspect somewhat downwards.

The costal surface is separated in this as in the preceding vertebra by a strong

vertical ridge or buttress from the wide depression below the posterior part

of the base of the spine. The angle between the oblique processes is rather

more open. The spinous process of this vertebra, almost entire, is detached

from the neural platform, but is cemented to the same mass of stone: it is
9 inches in height and 3 in breadth, or antero-posterior extent; the summit

is, however, wanting. The following are other dimensions of the present ver-

tebra :--                                          In. Lines.

The sides of the centrum are as usual concave lengthwise, but are slightly

convex vertically, and converge to the lower surface, which is formed by an

obtuse ridge.

   In a dorsal vertebra of the Horsham Iguanodon in Mr. Holmes's collection,
from apparently the middle of the back, the spinous process, which is 8 inches

in length, expands gradually in breadth and thickness as it ascends to its trun-

cated summit, the antero-posterior diameter of which is 4 inches, its trans-

verse diameter or thickness being 1 inch 6 lines.

    In a series of eight posterior dorsal vertebrae, measuring together 1 foot,
and consequently from a young Iguanodon in Mr. Holmes's collection, the
spinous process of the most anterior one is, in antero-posterior diameter, 7
lines, but increases in the other vertebrae to 15 lines, which shows a somewhat

rapid change of character.

 --Sacral Vertebrce. The highly remarkable and characteristic structure of

the sacrum of the Megalosaurus, and the strong indications of close affinity
between this gigantic carnivorous reptile and the still more colossal herbivo-

rous Igxianodon, wliich the structure of their costal vertebrae, of their ribs,

and of the larger bones of their extremities afford, made it very desirable to
ascertain whether the Iguanodon deviated in the same manner from other
Saurians, existing and extinct, in the extent and structure of the sacral region

of the spine.

not include this characteristic part of the skeleton ; it does not form part of

the series of bones obtained by Mr. Holmes from the Wealden Quarry at
Horsham ; but in the collection of rolled bones of the great Wealden Sau-

--rians Cetiosaurus, Streptospondylus, and Iguanodon in the museum of

Mr. SauU, there is a fine specimen of the sacrum with one of the iliac bones

attached, which, in the proportions of the vertebrae and the form of the ilium,
agrees with the known characters of the Iguanodon.

This instructive specimen consists of five vertebrae anchylosed together by

the articular surfaces of their bodies and by their spinous processes, which
seem to fonn a continuous thick median ridge of bone. The five vertebrae
measure 17 inches in length. The articular extremity of the terminal sacral

vertebra is very slightly concave and subcircular, measuring 3 inches in both

vertical and transverse diameter. The bodies of the dorsal vertebrae are com-

pressed at their middle part, and broader below than in the dorsal region, and
concave in the direction of their axis, the concavities being separated by the
broad prominent convex transverse ridges formed by the anchylosed and os-
sified intervertebral spaces. The contour of the under part of the sacrum
thus forms an undulating line. The lateral and inferior surfaces are separated
by a more angular prominence of the centrum, the under surface is less con-
vex transversely, and the whole centrum is shorter in proportion to its depth
and breadth, than in the Megalosaurus. The neurapophyses present the same
remarkable modification in regard to their relations to the body of the ver-
tebra as in the Megalosaurus, having shifted their position from the upper
surface of a single centrum to the interspace of two, resting on proportions
of these, which are more nearly equal, as the vertebrae are nearer the middle
of the sacrum. The nerves were compelled therefore to escape from the
spinal canal over the body of the vertebra, more or less near its middle, and
they impress the upper surface there with a smooth canal.

   The strong, vertically compressed, transverse processes, or sacral ribs, rise
from the bases of the neurapophyses, and their origin extends upwards upon
the Ispine, and downwards upon the sides of the contiguous vertebral bodies
and intervertebral space; in the specimen described they are firmly anchy-

losed to all these parts, extend outwards and expand at their extremities, four
of which meet, join, and form an elongated tract of varying breadth to which
the ilium is firmly attached. The length of the largest penultimate transverse
process was 5 inches 8 lines, its vertical breadth at the middle 3 inches, its
thickness here 1 inch. The adjoining (last) transverse process was 5 inches

in length ; the interspaces of the transverse processes equalled from 2\ inches
to 2 inches. The sacrum increases in breadth posteriorly ; its transverse dia-
meter, including the anchylosed ilia taken at the posterior part of the ace-
tabulum, is 13 inches, at the anterior part of the sacrum only 8 inches. The
proportion of the spine thus grasped, as it were, by the iliac bones, which
transmit the weight of the body upon the thigh-bones, corresponds with the
mass which is to be sustained and moved ; and the size and structure of the
sacrum indicate, with those of the femur and tibia, the adaptation of the
present great herbivorous Saurian for terrestrial life.

^,No.  Mantellian Collection, is the centrum of a sacral vertebra of a sub-

quadrate form, with a broad and flattened inferior surface, slightly concave
antero-posteriorly. The upper surface is excavated by a wide and moderately
deep canal, indicating the unusual size, for Reptiles, of the sacral portion of
the spinal chord. The anterior and posterior parts of the sides of this cen-
trum are raised, so as to form projecting sub-triangular rough articular sur-
faces, continued upon the margins of the spinal canal, evidently for the at-
tachment of the neurapophyses and the heads of the strong sacral ribs. The
            ON BRITISH FOSSIL REPTILES.                      131

interspace of these anterior and posterior neurapophysial surfaces is formed
by a smooth oblique groove, connecting the smooth surface of the spinal canal

with that of the free lateral surface of the vertebra, and indicating the place
of exit of the sacral nerves, which is necessarily in this unusual situation, be-
cause the ordinary holes of conjugation must have been obliterated by the
impaction of the bases of the neurapophyses between the contiguous extre-

mities of the bodies of the sacral vertebrae.

The anterior and posterior articular extremities of the present interesting

fossil equally bespeak the peculiar character of the sacral vertebrae of the

Dinosauria. They are impressed by coarse straight ridges and grooves ra-
diating from near the upper part of the surface, like those on the correspond-
ing part of a cetaceous vertebra when the epiphysial articular extremity is

removed. These inequalities are here, doubtless, preparatory to that anchy-

losis by which the sacral vertebrae are compacted together in the mature Di-

nosaurs.

   From its separated condition, the body of the sacral vertebra here described
must have belonged to a young Dinosaur of a size far exceeding that of the

HylcBOsaurus. It is obviously very distinct in form from the sacral vertebrae

of the Megalosaurus. No other reptile than one belonging to the order cha-

racterized by the peculiar structure of the sacrum already described, could
have yielded a detached vertebral centrum with the remarkable modifications
of the one under consideration. The modifications detected in the entire
sacrum of the Iguanodon in Mr. SauH's collection, justify the reference of the

--vertebra above described to the sacrum of a young Iguanodon.
    Caudal Vertebrce. These are distinguished by the single haemapophysial
surface at each end of the narrow inferior surface of the centrum. The sides
of the centrum are flat, or even slightly concave in the vertical direction,
though less so than in the antero-posterior direction. In a caudal cen-
trum, for example, in the Mantellian Collection, measuring ^ inches in
length, and 5 inches 4 lines in depth at the middle of the side, if a pencil
be laid vertically along that part, an interval of between 1 and 2 lines sepa-
rates its middle part from the bone. Those great Wealden vertebrae which,
on the contrary, have the middle of the side of the body prominent, and the
lower half only converging towards the under surface, are from the middle
and posterior part of the tail of the Cetiosaurus. The posterior terminal ar-
ticular surface is rather more concave than in the dorsal vertebrge ; but the
difference is by no means so marked as in the plano-concave vertebrae of the
Cetiosaurus. The transverse processes of the anterior caudal vertebrse are
comparatively short, but strong, and are continued from the base of the neur-

apophysis.

   The haemapophyses, or chevron bones, are not anchylosed to the centrum,

but articulate with the interspaces of the vertebrae ; in a few of the anterior
ones to two distinct but closely approximated surfaces on each contiguous
vertebra, but in the rest of the caudal vertebrae to a single oblique triangular
surface on each of the contiguous extremities of the centrum; the haemapo-

physes being here confluent at their vertebral as m ell as at their distal ex-

tremities.

A caudal vertebra exhibiting this modification in Mr. Holmes's collection

measures, in the vertical diameter of the articular surface, ·i inches 9 lines

in its transverse diameter, 4 inches 6 lines ; the breadth of the inferior sur-

face of the vertebra is 3 inches 3 lines. The interspace between the anterior

and posterior haemapophysial surface is 9 lines ; it is concave in the axis of

the vertebra. The diameter of the spinal canal is reduced in this vertebra to

9 lines. The transverse processes are of very small size. The spinous pro-

Wecess is broken off.   have seen that those of the sacral vertebrae appear to

have been short. There is reason to think that the spinous processes increased

in length for a certain distance as they receded from the sacrum, and then dimi-

nished. Thus, in a caudal vertebra (No. 2^, Mautellian Collection), evidently

anterior in position by its size, by its oblique processes, and by the place of

development of its transverse processes from the base of the neural arch,

the spinous process is 5 inches in height, while in the six caudal vertebrae

preserved in natural sequence and relative position in the Mantellian Collec-

tion, the spines are more than double that height. That the vertebra (No.

2130) is not a more posterior caudal vertebra from a larger Iguanodon is
shown by the relative thickness, as well as position, of its transverse pro-

cesses, as compared with the six caudal vertebras above mentioned, for their

transverse processes sensibly diminish in every diameter, and especially in

vertical thickness, from the first to the sixth ; and, moreover, it is evident

that, in this short series, the spines decrease in height both forwards from the

third as well as backwards, but more so in the latter direction. Thus the
Mspine of the first of these vertebrae is
                                           inches high, of the third 15 inches,

and of the sixth 13 inches. These spines increase in breadth toward their
summits, which are truncated, and in contact with each other, partly from

this expansion, partly from the posterior ones being slightly bent forwards.

One cannot witness this change of character in so short a segment of the tail

without a conviction that this appendage must have been relatively shorter

than in the Iguana.

   The first spine, besides being somewhat shorter, is more rounded off at its
anterior margin than the third, a difference which is still more obvious in the

detached caudal above described ; but above its origin a thin trenchant plate

is extended for a short distance from the middle of the anterior margin : this
character, which calls to mind one that is present in a greater proportion of
the vertebral column in the Crocodilians, is more strongly developed in the
second and third vertebree. The neurapophysial suture is more nearly ob-

literated in the sixth than in the first of this instructive series, or in the more

anterior and detached caudal vertebra. The following are dimensions of the

detached anterior caudal (No. 1), and of the first (No. 2) and last (No. 3)

The transverse processes disappear in the posterior caudal vertebras. The
chevron bones, of which three are preserved in the slab containing the six
caudal vertebree, exhibit the perforated character which distinguishes them
from those of the Cetiosaurus and of all existing Crocodiles and Lizards, not

excepting the Iguana, in which the haemapophyses are anchylosed at their
distal or spinal end only, and remain separate and articulated to two distinct

surfaces, at their proximal ends. The length of the superior and inferior
vertebral spines, and the shortness of the transverse processes, prove the form

of the tail to have been flattened laterally and of great breadth in the vertical

direction, at its basal portion at least.

 --Ribs. These appendages of the vertebral column are largely developed in

the thoracic abdominal region of the spine, and had the same two-fold con-

nexion with the vertebrae as in the other Dinosaurs and the Crocodilians. At

the anterior part of the costal region of the spine, the rib was joined by a
large head to a shallow cavity, situated at first on the side of the centrum and
then on the side of the neurapophysis ; and it was further articulated by a
tubercle to the extremity of the transverse process. In a certain number of
the anterior vertebrae, the neck of the rib was co-extensive with the transverse
process, and sometimes six or seven inches in length ; afterwards the neck of
the rib began to shorten, and the head to decrease in size, and to have its place
of articulation brought progressively nearer to the end of the transverse pro-
cess, until it finally disappeared, and the posterior ribs became appended to

the ends of the transverse processes.

   In the Iguana, as in other Lizards, the ribs have but one mode of articu-

lation, viz. to a simple tubercle developed from the side of the centrum.

   One of the largest double-jointed ribs of the Jguanodon, in the Mantellian

Collection (No.  gjig)'  is 46 inches in length. The neck is less distinct from

the tubercle and body than in other ribs, which seem to have been situated

further back ; it expands more gradually to the tubercular articulation with

the transverse process, and is at this part 5 inches in breadth ; it bends with

a deep oblique curve for about one-fifth of its length, and then is continued

in a nearly straight line to its extremity : this is slightly expanded and trun-
cated, for the attachment doubtless of a bony sternal rib. The convex or

outer margin of the rib is bent backwards so as to overhang the sub-com-

pressed shaft of the bone along its upper or proximal third part.
   The proximal extremity of one of the ribs from the middle of the trunk of

the Horsham Iguanodon, presents an ovate head 2^ inches in the long dia-
meter ; the neck is 7 inches long, straight, compressed, and topped by a well-
marked tubercle, where it joins the body of the rib. This part is also com-

pressed ; and its external margin, besides being bent backwards, is also deve-
loped in the contrary direction, so as to assume the form of a slightly convex

plate of bone 2 inches broad, attached at right angles to the shaft of the rib,

which it overhangs on both sides. This structure is characteristic also of
some of the ribs in the other Dinosaurs, and is interesting as indicating the
commencement of that peculiar development of the corresponding part of the

ribs in the Chelonian reptiles, by which the upper part of their bony box is

almost wholly formed.

  --Scapular Arch. The scapula has not hitherto been discovered so asso-

ciated with other unequivocal portions of the skeleton of the Iguanodon as to
permit the characters of this bone in that species to be confidently recognised.
The bone (No. 194', Oniopliitc of Iguanodon, Mantell. Catal.) agrees with

the undoubted scapula of the Hylaeosaur, and with that of certain Lacertians,
especially of the genus Sciticus*, in the production of a long and slender
pointed process, continued at nearly right angles with the body of the bone,
from the anterior part of the articular surface for the coracoid ; but it differs
from the scapula of the Hylasosaur in the presence of two short processes
given off from the lower part of the base of the long process, and in the ab-
sence of the thick and strong transverse acromial ridge which overarches the
glenoid depression, and in the deeper concavity of the posterior margin of
the ascending plate or body of the bone, 'i'his part, in its shape, relative
length and breadth, is intermediate between the Crocodilian and Lacertian
type of the scapula, at least as exemplified in the Monitors and Iguanas, where
it is broad and short. The Seines and Chameleons, in the more Crocodilian
proportions of their scapulae, resemble the Hylaeosaur and the great species
of extinct Saurian, most probably the Iguanodon, to which the present bone

belongs.

  --Coracoid. The thick articular portion of this bone, with its characteristic

perforation, here continued to the articular margin by a narrow fissure, di-
viding the scapular from the humeral articulation, ha^ been found of different
sizes in the Tilgate strata, and has been, with much probability, likewise re-
ferred to the Iguanodiiii. One of these portions of coracoid, which measured
10 inches in diameter, was found in the same block of stone with other

--unequivocal remains of Iguanodon.
    Clavicle. The doubts which are attached to the determination of the pre-

vious parts of the scapular arch are fortunately dissipated from the considera-
tion of this bone by the preservation of both the right and left clavicles in

the Maidstone Iguanodon. The presence of the fibula in the same block of
stone, and its discovery in close proximity with the tibia and femur in the
Wealden strata, satisfactorily prove that the present remarkable bone cannot

have formed part of the hinder extremity. And since, in other reptiles, the

radius differs from the fibula in little more than in being somewhat shorter
and thicker, there is still less reason for supposing it to belong to the fore-arm.

    The form of the ribs of the Iguanodon is well known, and they become
shorter and more curved as they advance from the middle to the anterior part
of the chest. The determination, therefore, which Dr. Mantell regarded as
most probable t, must be held to be the true one. The largest entire clavicle
from the Wealden strata measures 29 inches in length, and there is a portion
of another in the same collection one-third larger. The largest fibula of the
Iguanodon that has been found measures 28 inches. The bone is compressed,
slender, and subtrihedral at the middle part, expanded and flattened at the two
extremities, bent with a slight double curve in a graceful sigmoid form. The
broadest end, which, from the analogy of the Cyclodus lizard, must be re-
garded as the median or pectoral extremity, gives off two processes, the first

appearing as a continuation of the thinner margin of the bone, twisted and
produced obliquely downwards ; the second process is given off nearer the
expanded sternal end, towards which it slightly curves.

    * Dr. Mantell has pointed out this resemblance in his Memoir in the Phil. Trans., 1841.
   t " If we consider the form of this hone, it appears that the only place it can hold in the
skeleton must be either the thorax or lower extremities ; it may be a iibula, a rib, or a cla-

--vicle; and that it is a clavdcle of some extraordinary extinct reptile is certainly most pro-

bable." Geology of the South-east of England, p. 309. The subsequent discovery of the
Maidstone Iguanodon determined the species of reptile to which the bone in question be-
longed, and the comparisons mentioned in the text prove it to be a clavicle. The bone
attacl»ed to the coracoid and oraoplate of a small lizard, which I pointed out to Dr. Mantell
as resembling the one in question, was the clavicle of the Cyclodus nigroluteus. See Dr.
Mantell's late Memoir of 1?41, Phil. Trans., p. 138.

--Humerus. This important bone has not been hitherto satisfactorily deter-

mined ; it differs less from the femur in form in Reptiles than in Mammalia.

In the Crocodilians it is shorter than the femur, especially in the extinct pis-

civorous species, with biconcave vertebrae and more strictly aquatic habits.

In Lizards it is more nearly equal with the femur, and the similarity of the

size of these bones we may conceive to have been greater in the gigantic ter-

restrial Dinosaurs.

   In the modern Crocodiles, the chief distinction in the form of the humerus

is the ridge at the upper third of the bone : in Lizards this distinction is

almost lost. If we find the femur of the Iguanodon distinguished from that
of all other reptiles by the presence of a peculiar process from the inner side
of the bone, there are not wanting grounds to expect that the humerus may

present a similar character.

   As the reasons for suspecting that some of the large bones, hitherto uni-
formly regarded as the femora, may be the humeri of the Iguanodon, will best
appear in the description of the femur, I shall now proceed to the considera-
tion of the large bones with which the femur is articulated.

   Ilium.-- The iliac bone o{ the IgjMnodo7i* resembles in form that of the Mo-

nitor more than that of the Iguana : in the portion of the pelvis in Mr. SauU's
collection it measured 14 inches in length. It commences anteriorly by a
thick obtuse extremity slightly bent outwards ; this part is supported by the
thickest and strongest of the sacral ribs, which slightly inclines backwards :
the ilium quickly increases in vertical as well as transverse extent, forming at

its lower part the usual portion of the acetabulum ; the concavity terminating

behind in a broad obtuse prominence : behind this part the ilium rapidly con-

tracts, by a deep inferior emargination, to a comparatively slender process ex-
tending backwards and gradually diminishing to an obtuse point, well shown

in the detached ilia of the Maidstone Iguanodon, but here broken off. The
chord of the acetabular arc or concavity, in Mr. SauU's specimen, measured

8 inches.
   In the Maidstone Iguanodon the left ilium lies detached, with its sym-

physial articulation or inner surface uppermost, indicating by the extent of

that surface, which equals the antero-posterior diameter of nearly five of the
dorsal vertebraj of the same individual, the length of the sacrum peculiar to

this and other Dinosaurian reptiles. Its slender posterior portion terminates
in a subacute point : the anterior extremity of the right ischium, which has
the opposite surface exposed, bends slightly outwards in the form of a thick

tuberosity.                                            In. Lin.

   Pubis This bone, which presents a simple spatulate form in the Croco-
diles, already begins to increase in breadth at its symphysial extremity in the
extinct family with concave vertebra ; and in the larger existing species of
Lizards is expanded at both extremities, and has a very marked and recog-

--136 REPORT 1841.

nizable character superadded, in being bent outwards with a considerable

curvature.

  A massive fragment of a broad osseous plate, bearing a segment of a large

articular cavity at its thickest margin, and thence extended as a thinner plate,

bent with a bold curvature, and terminated by a thick rounded labrum, offers

characters of the Lacertian type of the pubis too obvious to be mistaken.

This specimen is from .the Tilgate strata; and, since the modifications of the

ilium of the Iguanodon in the Maidstone skeleton approximate to the Lacer-

tian type of the bone, and especially as manifested by the great Varani, in

which the recurved character of the pubic plate is most strongly marked, we
may, with much probability, assign the fossil in question to the pelvis of the

Iguanodon.

This fine portion of pubis is of an inequilateral triangular form, 16 inches

in its longest diameter, 9 inches 6 lines across its base or broadest part,

6 inches 8 lines across its narrowest part. The fractured surface of the bone,

near the acetabulum, is 3 inches 3 lines thick. The acetabular depression is

7 inches across, a proportion which corresponds with that of the acetabular

concavity in the ilium, and with the size of the cavity in which the head of

the Iguanodon's femur must have been received. One, angle of the cavity,

corresponding with the anterior one in the Varanus, is raised ; a broad and
low obtuse ridge bounds the rest of the free margin of the cavity. The

smooth labrum exchanges its character near one of the fractured edges of

the bone for a rough surface, which indicates the commencement of the sym-

physis. In the apparent absence of the perforation below the acetabular de-

--Apression, the present bone agrees with the Crocodilian type.
Ischium     second fragment of a large lamelliform bone (No. ^g, Man-

tellian Catalogue) presents, in its general form and slightly twisted character,

most resemblance to the ischium, with traceable modifications intermediate

to those presented by the extinct Goniopholis and modern Varani and Iguance,

The loss of the acetabular extremity, which is broken away, prevents a cer-

tain determination of this bone ; the only natural dimension that can be taken

is the circumference of the neck, or contracted portion between the acetabu-

lar end and the expanded symphysial plate : this circumference gives 7 inches.

--The slight twist of the bone upon this part as it expands to form the broad

symphysial plate, a character which is well marked in the ischium of the

--Goniopholis, gives it a superficial resemblance to the humerus of some of the

large Mammalia ; but the bone is too short in proportion to the breadth in-

dicated by the fractured symphysial end, to afford a probability of its having

been the humerus of a land reptile, and much less of the Iguanodon, in which

the form of the femur is well ascertained ; unless, indeed, there be actually
more discrepancy between the femur and humerus in size and form in the

Dinosaurs, than has, hitherto, been recognized in the Reptilian Class.

Femur.-^The Maidstone Iguanodon does not satisfactorily determine the

question of the principal bone of the fore and hind extremities, for whilst the

clavicles, many anterior dorsal vertebrse and anterior ribs, would lead one to

suppose that the two long bones found in their proximity might be humeri

on the other hand the presence of the iliac bones, with some caudal vertebrae
in the same slab, give equal probability to their being femora. The bones in

question (1 and 2 in the figure of the Maidstone Iguanodon, published by Dr.
Mantell in his ' Wonders of Geology,' vol.i. pi. ii.) have the same general cha-

racters, viz. the fiattened trochanter at the proximal end, the compressed ridge-

like process at the middle, and the two condyles with the deep and narrow

fissure at the distal end, which are presented by the larger detached bones,

described by Dr. Mantell as femora, from the Tilgate strata. They are other-

wise too much crushed and buried to yield materials for more minute com-

parison : each of these bones measures 33 inches in length.
   In five separate long bones, having the general characters of the two above-

mentioned in the Maidstone Iguanodon, numbered consecutively and marked
* Femur' in the Mantellian Collection, Nos. 1 and 3 differ from Nos. 4 and 5 in
the greater inward production of the head, making the concavity of the line
descending from the head to the median internal ridge somewhat deeper. The
lower angle of this median ridge is more produced in Nos. 1, 2 and 3, than in
Nos. 4 and 5. The whole inner contour is more regularly concave in No. 5,
than in Nos. 1 or 3. Of these five bones, No. 2 was found associated with a
tibia and fibula ; and if, therefore, the differences above indicated should be
more than mere individual varieties of the same bone, we might conclude
Nos. 4 and 5 to be humeri. Such conclusion appears more probable from the
circumstance of two of the longest and largest of the bones, having the gene-
ral characters of the femur of the Iguanodon, which were obtained by Mr.
Holmes from the quarry of the Wealden stone at Horsham, belonging both to

the right side.

   Now the other bones obtained in proximity with the above were all parts

of one large individual, and it is much more probable, therefore, that we have
here a right humerus and femur of the same individual, than two right femora
of different individuals. One of the differences noticed in the Tilgate speci-

mens, viz. the degree of obliquity at which the neck joins the shaft, is dis-

cernible in these ; and close to that bone, which shows the characters that we

have supposed to belong to the femur, were found bones corresponding with
the tibia and fibula.

  --Regarding then this as the femur, it presents the following characters : it

measures 3 feet in length : its circumference at the middle of the shaft is 18
inches: the contour of the rounded inward-projecting part of head is 17^
inches : two flat longitudinal facets meet near the middle of the anterior sur-
face of the shaft at a rough and slightly elevated angle, which runs straight

down to within thirteen inches of the distal end : the ridge there inclines to-

wards the internal condyle and subsides. Two strong vasti intermts et ex-

ternus muscles are indicated by this ridge. The head of the bone is carried

inwards, overhanging the shaft in a greater degree than the corresponding

part does in the humerus. The line of the inner side of the shaft describes

a graceful sinuous curve, being first concave, then slightly convex at the
middle, where there is an indication of the projecting ridge which has been
broken off: below this it is concave to the flattened antero-posteriorly ex-
tended, slightly concave surface, which descends vertically to the articular
surface of the condyle, which surface proceeds horizontally at nearly a right

angle with the line of the shaft of the bone. The antero-posterior extent of
the flattened condyle is 8 inches. The thickness of the external wall of the

shaft varies from half an inch to an inch.
    Both ends of this fine bone are crushed and mutilated.

   By the side of the femur were found two other bones, the largest of which
corresponds with the tibia. The external part of the head is considerably pro-

duced horizontally; the circumference of the proximal articular surface is 30
inches. The longitudinally finely striated vertical surface of the shaft of the
bone commences at the anterior part of the proximal end along a well-defined
curved line, which runs transversely across the bone, convex downwards in
the middle and concave downwards at each end : the bone rapidly contracts,
and assumes, about 8 inches below the head, the subquadrilateral form ; it is
broadest from side to side: its circumference is here 15 inches. The anterior
surface is flattened ; the outer or radial side convex or rounded : the dense ex-
--138 REPORT 1841.

ternal walls of this bone are very thick, at least 1 inch. The length of this

bone is 27 inches, but. it wants the distal end. The proximal articulation is

very convex from behind forwards, but, at the middle, it is slightly concave

from side to side.                                                                                                 In. Lines.

                    Its lateral diameter is                                                                        12

                    Its antero-posterior diameter is                                                               56

The disparity of size between the tibia and fibula is considerable, but the

disparity in the thickness of the two extremities of the bone is less than in the

bone which is described and figured as the fibula by Dr. Mantell. On the

middle of one of the flat sides of the fibula is an oblong rough surface slightly

raised, measuring 3 inches by 2 inches. The articular extremities of the fibula

are tuberculate ; the larger end is 4 inches across, the smaller one 3 inches

across. The shaft is subcompressed.

  A few yards from the three preceding bones was found the, presumed, hu-

merus, which measured 35 inches in length, being very nearly equal in size

with the femur. Its proximal extremity is crushed and mutilated : the shaft

is compressed             from  before  backwards                                               concave  behind :  the submedian ridge
                                                                                             ;

or compressed process is developed from the inner side of the shaft at the usual

situation, and corresponds in form with those of the bones Nos. 4 and 5, Man-
tellian Collection. The distal condyles are divided anteriorly by a narrow lon-

gitudinal furrow, which penetrates deeply between them. As the absence of the

deep fissure between the condyles of the femur is repeated in the humerus of

the Iguana, so may its presence be repeated in the humerus of the Iguanodon.
   The inner condyle projects backwards beyond the outer one, which is di-

stinguished by being traversed by a longitudinal groove. This bone difliers

from the femur in the shorter neck supporting the head, in its more promi-

nent median process, and in the uniform though slight concavity of the inner

margin of the shaft.

   The preceding observations were made during an inspection of the fossils
in Mr. Holmes's interesting collection in the summer of 1840. I have subse-

quently been favoured by a letter from that gentleman, containing the follow-

ing clear and valuable observations on tiie two large bones in his collection,

which support the view I had taken of their nature.

"I have also examined the two large bones concerning which so much

doubt exists. They both appear to belong to right extremities, but as the

one which has the trochanter, and which by way of distinction I shall call

No. 1 (humerus?), is so much crushed in the direction of the rough ridge, so

strongly marked in the other, I cannot say with any degree of certainty whe-

ther it possessed the same form or not. There is, however, this difference at

any rate. The head of No. 1 is so much mutilated that little can be said

about it, but it is very clear that the neck is shorter than that of No. 2 (fe-

mur?), and there is a variation of nearly one-half in the degree of obliquity

from the perpendicular of the shaft of the bone in which the two heads are

set  on             that  of No. 2  being more  so than the other.                                       They also differ in an-

both bones to be placed in an erect position, to the superior portion of the

No. 2 is longer in the shaft than the other bones, which, if they both belonged

to the same individual, (and I think there is no sufficient reason to doubt it)

would, according to thy conjecture, make it appear that one is the femur and

the other the humerus.

" The question next arises as to which of the bones either name is to be ap-

propriated. No. 1 has the trochanter, which is very similar in shape to the
femur marked No. 5 in the British Museum. No. 2 has none in its present

mutilated state, but on examining the posterior part of the shaft, where on the
internal side one might expect to meet with some remains of the base of the

trochanter, I find the surface of the bone concave, and it diverges much more

than I should suppose it would do if it had merely been continuous with the

returning surface from the anterior part of the bone, if there had been no

trochanter interposed to disturb the otherwise greater rotundity of the shape.

   " This leads me to suppose that it once had one, and that it probably might
ha,ve been formed like that in Nos. 1 and 2 in the British Museum. If they

were not the bones of distinct animals, this might perhaps have been the
case." Dated Horsham, Nov. 2nd, 1841.

   The characters of the articular extremities of the femur which are obscured

by the mutilated condition of the large specimen, are beautifully shown in
the femur of a young IguanodoH, obtained from a pit near Rusper, four miles
north of Horsham. The rounded portion of the head extends inwards ; it is
indented at its anterior part by the commencement of a longitudinal broad
channel, which extends down uj)on the shaft : the articular surface is not con-
fined to the inwardly produced head, but extends over the whole proximal

horizontal surface of the femur, expanding as it approaches the outer part of

the head. The articular surface is circumscribed by a well-defined linear

groove, which separates it from the longitudinal striated surface of the shaft
of the bone. At the posterior and external angle of the articular proximal

end of the bone, a longitudinal column, separated by a longitudinal groove
from the main shaft of the bone, falls into that shaft a little lower down the

distal end : here the shaft expands and becomes flattened from before back-
wards. The distal end is characterized by a deep and narrow anterior longi-

tudinal groove, situated not quite in the middle, but nearer the internal con-

dyle : there is a corresponding longitudinal groove on the posterior part of
the distal end, which is wider than the anterior one, and in the middle of the

bone, separating the two condyles, but inclining beneath, and, as it were, un-

dermining the backward projecting part of the internal condyle ; this is much
more prominent than the external one, which is traversed or divided by a
narrow longitudinal fissure. The articular surface is irregular and tubercu-

   The femur of the Iguana differs as widely from that of the Iguanodon as
does that of the Monitor or any other Lacertiau reptile. The forms of the
head and trochanter of the femur of the Iguana are just the reverse of those
in the Iguanodon. The head of the femur in the Iguana is flattened from side
to side, and its upper convex surface is extended from before backwards, ma-

king no projection over the gentle concave line leading from its inner surface

down to the inner condyle. In the Iguanodon the head is rounded and rather
compressed from before backwards ; and is produced, as in Mammals, over

the inner side of the shaft.

   In the Iguana the trochanter is compressed from before b.ackwards, and is
separated by a wide and shallow groove from the oppositely compressed head :
in the Iguanodon the trochanter is singularly flattened from side to side, and

is applied to the outer side of the thick neck, from which it is separated by a
deep and narrow fissure. The Iguana has no submedian internal process, and
its distal condyles are slightly divided by a shallow depression.

   The circumference of the femur of the Iguanodon very nearly equals one-

half its length : the circumference of the femur of the Iguana only equals one-
--140 REPORT 1841.

fourth its length : yet the femur of the Iguanodon equals the united length of

eleven of its dorsal vertebrae, while that of the Iguana equals the united length

of only six of its dorsal vertebrae.

The femora of the Iguana stand out, like those of most other Lacertians,

at right angles with the vertical plane of the trunk, which is rather slung upon

than supported by those bones : but it is evident from the superior relative

length and strength of those bones in the Iguanodon, from the different con-

formation of the articular, especially the proximal extremities, and from the

ridges and processes indicative of the powerful muscles inserted into the bone,

that it must have sustained the weight of the body in a manner more nearly

resembling that in the pachydermal Mammalia. As in some of the more

bulky of these quadrupeds, the indication of the 'ligamentum teres 'is wanting

in the head of the femur of the Iguanodon.

The tibia of the Iguanodon equals the united length of nine of the dorsal

vertebrae, while in the Iguana it does not exceed the united length of five dor-

sal vertebrae, although it more nearly equals the femur in length than in the

Iguanodon. The head of the tibia is more expanded and complicated by deep

and wide grooves in the Iguanodon : the fibula is less expanded towards the

distal end and less flattened against the tibia in the Iguanodon.

The fibula of the small Iguanodon from the pit at Rusper, equals the an-

tero-posterior extent of the spines of eight dorsal vertebrae of the same indi-

vidual. This bone is 13 inches long, 2 inches across the proximal end, and

6 lines across the distal end.

Of the great Iguanodon from the Horsham quarry two metacarpal or me-

tatarsal bones are preserved in natural juxtaposition : one exceeds the other

by four inches, and measures 2 feet 6 inches ; the breadth of its distal end is 3

inches 3 lines ; the shaft is compressed and subtrihedral ; its texture is spongy

at the centre. The proximal end is expanded, with a nearly flat articular sur-

face, the contour of which is broken by two longitudinal indentations : the

distal end offers a well-sculptured trochlear articulation for the first phalanx.

The bone of the Maidstone-^Ma«oc?ow(marked 7inthe figure above cited in the

' Wonders of Geology') corresponds with the above described bones of the foot.

Some of the phalanges, probably the middle ones, appear to have been sin-

gularly abbreviated ; but they have not yet been discovered in such juxtapo-

sition with undoubted Iguanodon's bones as to justify a more precise descrip-

tion of their characters under the present head.

The distal or ungual phalanges of the Iguanodon, although doubtless offer-

ing certain modifications of form in different toes, are shown by those pre-

served in the Maidstone Iguanodon, and others of much larger dimensions,

found associated with the bones of the great Iguanodon of the Horsham

quarry, to have had a less incurved, broader and more depressed form than

in other known Saurians. Two of the largest ungual phalanges of the Hor-

sham Ig^ianodon in Mr. Holmes's collection, are broad, subdepressed, with

the curved vascular groove on each side, as in most other Saurians, with a

slightly concave articular base, and terminating forwards in a round blunt

edge ; the outer boundary of the lateral grooves forms, at the posterior end of

the groove, a laterally projecting process, rendering this part of the phalanx

broader than the articular extremity or basis. The following are dimensions

of the largest of the two phalanges :                       In. Lines.

This phalanx is slightly bent downwards ; the under surface being concave

longitudinally, but convex from side to side ; less so than on the upper surface.

The under surface is rough ; the upper surface nearly smooth, except at the

margin of the articular surface, on the projecting sides and at the distal ex-

tremity, which is sculptured by irregular vascular grooves and holes. The

phalanx has a slight oblique twist to one side, and is somewhat thinned off to

that side on which the curved groove is longer than on the other side.

   In Mr. SauU's museum is an ungual phalanx of an Iguanodon, which nearly
equals those from Horsham, and presents the same subdepressed form. The

base is slightly convex transversely ; more concave vertically : the articular

surface is faintly divided by a median vertical rising : the rounded edge of

the articular surface is slightly raised, interrupted on both sides by the smooth

shallow commencement of the curved vascular groove : this deepens and con-

tracts as it extends forwards. The upper surface is convex longitudinally

and transversely ; the lower surface is rather more convex transversely than
the upper, but is slightly concave longitudinally. The upper and lateral sur-

faces, for about an inch near the base, are deeply sculptured bj' large irregular

longitudinal grooves and ridges ; the rest of the upper surface is impressed

by fine interrupted longitudinal impressions ; but having, on the whole, a

smooth appearance. The laminated superposition of the exterior compact

portion of the bone is shown by the separation of portions of the layers of

about one line in thickness. The under surface is more deeply impressed by

cavities having reticulate elevations. The right aliform process begins 10

lines from the articular surface, the left about 14 lines from the same part:

their base is bounded below by slight impressions, and above by the lateral

Acanals, which appear to sink into the bone.  few distant vascular grooves

mark the upper surface of the bone, but more numerous larger ones are situated

near the lateral canals and at the broken anterior end of the phalanx. The

following are the dimensions of this bone :           In. Lines.

it was probably more than 5 inches long when entire.

The largest of the phalangeal bones in the collection of Wealden Rep-

tiles in the British Museum, which from its breadth, slight degree of ob-

liquity and vascular canals is referrible to the Iguanodon, is less than those

just described. The phalanx in question (No.g^^^, Mantellian Collection) is

conical, 4| inches long, probably 5 inches when entire ; but the apex is broken

off": the longest diameter of the base or articular surface is 3 inches 3 lines

it is slightly and obliquely compressed, and very slightly curved, and from this

circumstance, as well as from the obliquity of the base and its unsymmetrical

figure, it probably belonged to the small outer or inner toe at the margin of

the foot. Only a small part of the natural smooth articular surface is left, the

rest appears to have been scraped away, so that the coarse cancellous structure

of the middle of the bone is exposed. The free surface of the bone near the

base is deeply sculptured by irregular longitudinal furrows, which served for

the implantation of the articular ligaments. The rest of the free surface is

tolerably smooth, except at the sides near the apex, where there are numerous

oblique outlets for the large vessels and nerves supplying the secreting organ
of the claw. The two lateral longitudinal curved grooves which characterize

the claws of most Saurians are here well developed ; they commence, one at,

the other near, the base ; are at first shallow, then deepen, and finally sink into
--142 REPORT 1841.

the substance of the bone about 1§ inch from its fractured apex. Below one
of these canals there is a shallow smooth impression, corresponding no doubt
with the margin of the claw. The under surface of the phalanx indicated by
the concavity of the curved grooves is more convex transversely than the
upper surface : the distance between the converging lateral grooves in this

surface is one inch.

   Among the few other phalangeal bones from Dr. Mantell's collection in the

British Museum, there is one (figured in the ' Wonders of Geology,' pi. iii.
fig. 1, as belonging to the fore-foot of the Iguanodon) which differs in a
marked manner from the specimens just described, being as much compressed

from side to side as the Iguanodon's ungual phalanges are, for the most part,

flattened from above downwards. One of these compressed phalanges must
have been at least four inches in length ; it now measures three inches, with

the extremity broken ofi"; it is 2 inches 8 lines in vertical diameter at the

base, and only 1 inch 2 lines in the greatest transverse diameter. The
phalanx is more curved downwards than any of the true Iguanodon's pha-
langes, and it is traversed by a longer and shallower groove, the lower

margin of which is not produced into a lateral aliform process, nor does the
distal end of the groove sink into the substance of the bone.

   The ungual phalanges on both the fore and hind feet of the Iguana resem-
ble this phalanx in form more than they do those of the Iguanodon. In the

fore-foot of the Crocodile the ungual phalanx of the first or innermost toe is

broad and flat, with lateral ridges, much resembling the depressed phalanges
of the Iguanodon. The ungual phalanx of the third digit is of the same length,

but is thinner in botli transverse and vertical directions, but is less so in the
latter. It is not more curved. Still the difference (and this is the greatest
that I can perceive in comparing the different ungual phalanges of the same

individual Crocodile (Croc.oc?/tos)) is much less than that which is manifested

between the depressed and the compressed phalanges hitherto referred to the
Iguanodon. In the great proportion of the skeleton found near Maidstone
are two phalanges which correspond in form with those enormous specimens
found near Horsham, and with the small depressed claw-bones from Tilgate
Forest, unquestionably belonging to the Iguanodon, and supposed by Dr.

--Mantell to be peculiar to the hind-foot of that Saurian.
   Size of the Iguanodon. From the comparison, which the few connected

portions of the skeleton of the Iguanodon enable us to make, between the
bones of the extremities and the vertebral column, it is evident that the hind-
legs at least, and probably also the fore-legs, were longer and stronger in pro-
portion to the trunk than in any existing Saurian. One can scarcely suppress
a feeling of surprise, that this striking characteristic of the Iguanodon, in com-

mon with other Dinosauria, should have been, hitherto, overlooked ; since the

required evidence is only an associated vertebra and long bone of the same
individual, or a comparison of the largest detached vertebrae with the longest
femora or humeri. This characteristic is, nevertheless, one of the most im-
portant towards a restoration of the extinct reptile, since an approximation to
a true conception of the size of the entire animal could only be made after the
general proportions of the body to the extremities had been ascertained.

    But it is very obvious tliat the exaggerated resemblances of the Iguanodon
to the Iguana have misled the Palaeontologists who have hitherto published
the results of their calculations of the size of the Iguanodon; and, hence, the
dimensions of 100 feet in length arrived at by a comparison of the teeth and
clavicle of the Iguanodon with the Iguana, of 75 feet from a similar compa-
rison of their femora, and of 80 feet from that of the claw-bone, which, if
founded upon the largest specimen from Horsham, instead of the one com-
On BRITISH FOSSIL REPTILES.  143

pared by Dr. Mantell *, would yield a result of upwards of 200 feet for the total
length of the Iguanodon, since the Horsham phalanx exceeds the size of the
largest of the recent Iguana's phalanges by 40 times !

    But the same reasons which have been assigned for calculating the bulk of

the Megalosaurus on the basis of the vertebrae, apply with equal force to the

Iguanodon. Now the largest vertebra of an Iguanodon which has yet been

obtained does not, as has been before stated, exceed 4^ inches in length ; the

most common size being 4 inches. The intervertebral substance is shown, by

the naturally juxtaposed series of dorsal vertebrae in the Maidstone Iguano-
don, to be not more than one-third of an inch in thickness. All the accurately
determined vertebrae of the Iguanodon manifest the same constancy of their
antero-posterior diameter which prevails in Saurians generally ; the discovery

of the true character of the supposed Lacertian vertebrae, six inches in length,
removes the only remaining doubt that could have attached itself to this im-

portant element in the present calculation-}-. The cervical vertebrae of the
Iguanodon, when discovered, if they prove to differ in length from the known
dorsal and caudal vertebrae, will be, in all probability, somewhat shorter, as
they are in the Hylaeosaur and in all known Crocodiles and Lizards. It re-
mains, therefore, to discover the most probable number of the vertebrae of the

Iguanodon, in order to apply their length individually to the estimate of the

length of the entire body. The structure of the vertebrae and the ribs, and
especially the variation in both structure and size which the ribs of the Igua-

nodon, already obtained, demonstrate to have prevailed in the costal series,

render it much more probable that the number of the costal vertebrae would

resemble that of the Crocodiles than that of the Scincus or other Lizards with
unusually numerous dorsal vertebrae, and which possess ribs of a simple and

uniform structure, and of nearly equal size. The most probable number of
vertebrae of the trunk, from the atlas to the last lumbar inclusive, calculated
from Crocodilian analogies, would be 24 vertebrae ; which is also the number
possessed by the Iguana.

    Twenty-four vertebrae, estimated with their intervertebral spaces at 5 inches

each, give 10 feet ; if to this we add the length of the sacrum, viz. 17 inches,
then that of the trunk of the Iguanodon would be 11 feet 5 inches; which

exceeds that of the Megatherium. If there be any part of the skeleton of

the Iguana which may with greater probability than the rest be supposed

to have the proportions of the corresponding part of the Iguanodon, it is the
lower jaw, by virtue of the analogy of the teeth and the substances they are

adapted to prepare for digestion. Now the lower jaw gives the length of the

head in the Iguana, and this equals the length of six dorsal vertebrae, so that
as 5 inches rather exceeds the length of the largest Iguanodon's vertebra yet
obtained, with the intervertebral space superadded,onthis calculation the lensjth
of the head of the \a,rgest Igutmodon must have been 2 feet 6 inches. In the
description of the caudal vertebrae it has been shown that theIguanodo7i could
as little have resembled the Iguana in the length of its tail;]:, as in the anato-
mical characters of any of the constituent vertebra of that part : the chano-es
which the series of six caudal vertebrae present in the length and form of the
spinous processes, and in the place of origin of the transverse processes, indi-
cate the tail to have been shorter in the Iguanodon than in the Crocodile.
Assuming, however, that the number of caudal vertebrae of the Iguanodon
equalled that in the Crocodile, and alloAving to each vertebra with its inter-

vertebral space 4|- inches, we obtain the length of 12 feet 6 inches for the
tail of the Iguanodon. On the foregoing data, therefore, we may liberally

assign the following dimensions to the Iguanodon :  Feet.

   The same observations on the general form and proportions of the animal,
and its approximation in this respect to the Mammalia, especially the great
extinct Megatherioid or Pachyd.ermal species, apply as well to the Iguanodon

as to the Megalosaurus.

                Order LACERTILIA.

Leaving now the gigantic Saurians constituting the order Dinosauria,

above characterized, and establishing in several important points of their os-

teological structure the transition from the Crocodilian to theLacertian order,
I next proceed to notice the remains of those extinct Reptiles, which manifest

in the enduring parts of their organization a closer affinity to the extensive
and varied order of the smaller and lower organized Saurians which are dis-

tributed over all the warmer parts of the present surface of the earth.
   The ancient representatives of the Lacertian order are for the most part of

gigantic size, and deviate, like many of the ancient Crocodilians, from ex-

isting Lizards, by very remarkable characters of the vertebrae, teeth, and

dermal bones.

                Genus Mosasaurus.

   Commencing with the species which retain the ordinary ball and socket

structure of the vertebrae, the gigantic Mosasaurus first claims attention. Two

vertebrae which have the anterior articular facet concave,' the posterior con-
vex, and the other characters of this genus, are preserved in the Mantellian
Collection. They are from the chalk formation in Sussex, and have been re-
ferred by Dr. Mantell to the genus Mosasaurus.

                                           Genus Leiodon.

    Hitherto no teeth corresponding with those of the Mosasaurus Hoffmanni
of St. Peter's Mount near Maestricht, have been discovered in the chalk
formations of England. The teeth of the Pliosaur have, in some instances,

been mistaken for those of the Mosasaur.

   The teeth from the chalk of Norfolk, figured and described in my 'Odonto-

graphy*' as representatives of the gen\xs Leiodon, make the nearest approach
to the characters of those of the Mosasaurus. They are about one half the
size of the maxillary teeth of the Mosasaurus Hoffmanni, and difi"er more es-

sentially in having their outer side as convex as the inner side, the transverse

section of the crown being elliptic, the pointed extremities of the ellipse cor-
responding with two opposite longitudinal trenchant ridges, which separate
the outer from the^ inner side of the tooth. The crown expands at the base,
which is circular, and is anchylosed to a conical process, developed from the
broad alveolar margin of the jaw. In this, which is termed the " acrodoi^t
type of dentition, the Leiodon corresponds with the Mosasaur. It is proba-

ble that the vertebrae of the two extinct reptiles may have corresponded in

form ; and it is possible that those from the English chalk, hitherto referred

to the Mosasaurus, may appertain to the same species as the teeth here de-

                * P. 261, pi. Ixxii.

scribed. From tlie correspondence in the general structure, smootli external
surface, and mode of attachment of tlie teeth between the Maestriclit Mosa-
saur and the English Leiodon, it may be concluded that the latter reptile had
the same affinity to the Lacertian type, which the Mosasaur so strikingly

manifests in the presence of pterygoid teeth.

                            Genus Kaphiosaurus.

Under this name I propose to notice a small and hitherto undescribed genus

of Lacertians, from tlie chalk I'ormations near Cambridge, indicated by a por-

tion of the lower jaw, containing twenty-two close-set, awl-shaped teeth an-

chylosed by their bases to an outer alveolar parapet of bone, and thus corre-

sponding with the pleurodout type of dentition among the Lizards.
   To the same genus may belong a beautiful specimen in the museum of Sir

Philip Egerton, consisting of a series of twenty dorsal, two lumbar, two

sacral, and a few of the caudal vertebrae, with the pelvic bones, from the chalk

near Maidstone, which correspond with the jaw of the Raphiosaiirus in size.
The vertebral characters are essentially those of the modern Lacertians ; but
the absence of extremities and teeth prevents the generic affinities being ac-

curately determined.

    It is interesting to find this second- instajiee of the ' procoelian ' type of

-- --vertebrae or those with the anterior cup and posterior ball in the chalk

formations, below which I have not met with any instance of a Reptile agree-

ing with the existing species in this structure.

 --Pleurodont Eocene Lizard. Among the fossils obtained by Mr. Col-

chester from the Eocene sand, underlying the Red Crag at Kyson, or King-

ston, in Suffolk, the existence of a lizard, about the size of the Iguana, is in-
dicated by a part of a lower jaw, armed with close-set, slender, subcylindri-

cal, antero-posteriorly compressed teeth, attached to shallow alveoli, and with

their bases protected by an external jjarapet of bone. The fragment of jaw

is traversed by a longitudinal groove on the inside, and perforated, as in most

modern lizards, by immerous vascular foramina along the outside. The teeth

are hollow at their Ijase.
-- AScincoid Oolite Lizard.
                             small Lacertian is indicated by remains dis-

covered in the celebrated oolite at Stonesiield. The most intelligible of these

is a femur, ten lines in lengtli, having a hemispherical head supported on

a short subcompressed neck, on each side of the base of which there is a

strong conical trochanterian process : the middle of the shaft is cylindrical,
and soon expands to form a broad distal extremity. This shape of the bone

proves it not to be the young of any of the great Saui'ians hitherto discovered

at Stonesfield (the expansion of the distal end removes it from the Ciielonian

reptiles), but indicates its affinity to the Scincoidian lizards, the largest forms

of which, it may be remarked, now exist in Australia, where they are asso-

ciated with Araucaria: and cycadeous plants, with living Terebratulce, and Tri-

gonicE, and with the peculiar marsupial quadrupeds ; the remains of all which
forms of organized beings characterize the same stratum and locality as that
in which the present extinct Lacertian was found.

   No vertebras of tlie procoelian type have hitherto Iieen discovered in the

oolite, and it is most probable that those of the small Lacertian here indica-

ted, agree with those of most other extinct Saurians of the secondary forma-

tions in having both articular extremities subconcave.

                            Genus Riiynchosaurus.

The biconcave structure unquestionably characterizes the vertebra? of the

small Lacertian from the new red sandstone quarries near Shrewsbury, on
which the M'ell-mt\rkeU and distinct genus Rhynchosaurus is founded.

1841,                        I,
--146 REPORT 1841.

   For the opportunity of examining the rare and interesting remains of the

Rhynchosaurus I am indebted to Dr. Ogier Ward of Shrewsburj^, and to the
Council of the Natural History Society of that town, in the museum of which

many of the fossils here described are deposited.
   They occur at the Grinsill quarries, in a fine-grained sandstone, and also in

a coarse burr-sandstone ; in the latter are imbedded some vertebree, portions
of the lower jaw, a nearly entire skull, fragments of the pelvis and of two
femora: in the fine-grained sandstone, vertebrae, ribs, and some bones of the
scapular and pelvic arches are imbedded. The bones present a very brittle

and compact texture ; the exposed surface is usually smooth, or very finely
striated, and of a light blue colour. The sandstones containing these bones

occasionally exhibit impressions of footsteps which resemble those figured in

the Memoir by Messrs. Murchison and Strickland, Geol. Trans., 2nd Series,

vol. V. pi. xxviii. fig. 1, but differ in the more distinct marks of the claws, the

less distinct impression of a web, the more diminutive size of the innermost toe,
and an impression corresponding with the hinder part of the foot, which Dr.

Ward compares to " a hind-toe pointing backwardt-, that, like the hind-claw

of some birds, only touched the ground with its point, which was armed in
some of the foot-prints with a claw still longer than those of the fore-toes *."

The foot-prints are likewise more equal in size and likewise in their intervals
than those figured by Messrs. Murchison and Strickland : they measure from

the extremity of the outermost or fifth toe to that of the innermost or first

rudimental toe, about one inch and a half. They are the only foot-prints that
have as yet been detected in the new red sandstone quarries at Grinsill.

 , I proceed now to describe the fossil bones, respecting which Dr. Ward ob-

serves, " as they have always been found nearly in the same bed as that im-

pressed by the footsteps above described, I am induced to believe that these

are the bones of the same animal :" an opinion, Avhich, from the correspond-

ence between the bones and the foot-prints in size, is, at least, highly probable.

  --Vertebrce. Both surfaces of the centrum are concave, and are deeper than

in the biconcave vertebree of the extinct Crocodilians ; the texture of the cen-

trum is compact throughout. The two lateral surfaces join the under surface

at a nearly right angle, the transverse section presenting a subquadrate form,

with the angles rounded off: the under surface and sides are regularly con-

cave longitudinally.

The neural arch is anchylosed with the centrum, without trace of suture, as in

most lizards : it immediately expands and sends outwards from each angle of its

base a broad triangular process with a flat articular surface ; the two anterior
surfaces look directly upwards, the posterior ones downwards ; the latter are
continued backwards beyond the posterior extremity of the centrum; the tu-

bercle for the simple articulation of the rib is situated immediately beneath the

anterior oblique process. So far the vertebrae of the Rhynchosaurus, always

excepting their biconcave structure, resemble the vertebrae of most recent li-

zards. In the modification next to be noticed, they show one of the verte-

Abral characters of the Dinosauria.  broad obtuse ridge rises from the upper

convex surface of the posterior articular process and arches forwards along

the neural arch above the anterior articular process, and gradually subsides

anterior to its base : the upper part of this arched angular ridge forms, Avith
that of the opposite side, a platform, from the middle line of which the spi-

nous process is developed. This structure is not present in existing lizards;

the sides of the neural arch in their vertebrae immediately converge from the

articular processes to the base of the spine, without the intervention of an

angular ridge formed by the side of a raised platform. The base of the spinous

roots or ridges, one from the upper and back part of each posterior articular

process : they meet at the posterior part of the summit of the neural arch,

whence the spinous process is continued upwards as a simple plate of bone,

its base extending forwards along about two-thirds of the length of the plat-

form, which then again divides into two ridges, which diverge from each other

in slight curves to the anterior and external angles of the neurapophyses. The

interspace of the diverging anterior crura of the base of the spine is occupied

by a triangular fossa, not continued into the substance of the spine ; this

fossa is bounded below by u horizontal plate of bone extended over the an-

terior part of the spinal canal, and terminated by a convex outline. The

anterior margin of the spinous process is thin and trenchant; the height of

the spine does not exceed the antero- posterior diameter of its base ; it is

obliquely rounded off. The spinal canal sinks into the middle part of the

centrum and rises to the base of the spine, so that its vertical diameter is twice

as great at the middle as at the two extremities : this modification resembles

in a certain degi'ee that of the vertebrae of the Palaosaurus from the Bristol

conglomerate. The following are dimensions of the most perfect of the dorsal

vertebrae of the Rhvnchosaurus :                                      Lt i·nes,

--Skull. The most complete specimen yet obtained of this instructive part

of the skeleton of the Rhynchosaurus, is imbedded in a portion of the coarse-

grained sandstone from the Grinsill quarries. The lower jaw is in its natural
position, as when the mouth is shut, showing that the parts had not been dis-

located from the time of the death of the animal to its becoming imbedded in

the sand.

The skull presents the form of a four-sided pyramid, compressed laterally,

and with the upper facet arching down in a graceful curve to the apex, which

is formed by the termination of the muzzle. The very narrow cranial box;

the wide temporal fossae on each side, bounded posteriorly by the parietal and

the mastoid bones, and laterally by strong compressed zygomata ; the long

tympanic pedicle, descending freely and vertically from the point of union of

the posterior transverse and zygomatic arches, and terminating in a convex

pulley for the articular concavity of the lower jaw ; the large and complete

--orbits ; and the short, compressed, and bent down maxillae, all combine to

prove the i'ossil to belong to the Lacertian division of the Saurian order. The

mode of articulation of the skull with the spine cannot be determined in the

present specimen, but the lateral compression and the depth of the skull, the

great vertical breadth of the superior maxillary bone, the smaller relative size

of the temporal spaces, the great vertical breadth of the lower jaw, all prove

that it does not belong to a reptile of the Batrachian order. The shortness

of the muzzle and its compressed form, equally remove it from the Croeodili-

ans. No Clieloniau has the tympanic pedicle so long, so narrow, or so freely

suspended to the posterior and lateral angles of the cranium.

The general aspect of the skull differs, however, from that of existing Lacer-

tians, and resembles that of a bird or turtle, which resemblance is increased

by the apparent absence of teeth. The intermaxillary bones, moreover, are

double, as in Crocodiles and Chelonians, but, with this exception, all the essen-

tial characters of the structure of the skull are those of the Lizard.

   Of the proper walls of the cerebral cavity, the portion formed by the parietal

and frontal bones is exposed ; the parietal is traversed longitudinally by a thin,
but high, median crest; the part of the bone forming the sides of the small

cerebral cavity are convex, and the breadth of the bone diminishes towards

the occiput ; here it divides into two branches, which pass outwards more

transversely than in existing lizards. There is no perforation either in the

parietal bone or in the coronal suture. At the anterior part of the parietal

crest two lines diverge from each other at a right angle to the upper part of

Athe oi'bit, and separate the post-frontals.  nearly transverse suture divides

the fore-part of the parietal from the post-frontals. The median frontal bone

is single, like tiiat of the New World Monitors ( Thorictes, Tejus, <Src.) and the

Iguanse, and not divided, as in the Varanians. It expands slightly as it ad-

vances towards the fore-part of the orbits : the oblique lines dividing the

median frontals from the post-frontals, and the supraorbital ridges are raised,

so that the interspace is slightly concave, and the surface is also broken by

irregular elevations and depressions. Each post-frontal is divided by a nearly

transverse suture. The posterior frontal completes the upper and outer part

of the orbit by a thin, well-defined, curved plate ; an irregular obtuse ridge

descends in a nearly vertical direction behind this plate, and then the posterior

frontal contracts and is extended backwards in the form of along compressed

process, gradually terminating in a point, which overlaps the zygomatic bone.

This bone forms the medium of union between the long posterior frontal and

the mastoid.

The tympanic bone presents a slight sigmoid flexure, and is expanded trans-

versely at its distal extremity ; its posterior surface is exposed, which is con-
vex and rounded, and continued externally in the form of a thin plate, which

is concave behind. The thick convex stem divides near the lower end into

two ridges, which diverge, like the condyles of a humerus, and intercept the

trochlea, on Avhich the concave articulation of the lower jaw plays. The tym-

panic trochlea is convex from behind forwards, concave from side to side.

The orbit is large, nearly circular in form, and its bony frame is complete

this is formed above by the median, anterior, and posterior frontals ; before

by the anterior frontal and lachrymal; below by the malar; and behind by the

malar and posterior frontal.

The malar bone, as in most lizards, is long, slender, and bent upon itself,

but its external surface is unusually concave, the orbital plate bending out-

wards like the corresponding rim formed by the frontal bone. The anterior

or horizontal branch of the malar gradually tapers to a point which is Avedged

in between the lachrymal and maxillary bones. The posterior branch ascends

at nearly a right angle, and is apjilied obliquely to the posterior part of the

descending process of the posterior frontal. At the angle between the two

portions of the malar a process is continued backwards for about half an inch,

but its extremity is broken off. The lachrymal bone presents the same relative

position and size as in the Thorictes, Lacerta, and most lizards ; a tubercle
rises from about the middle of its external surface. The superior maxillary

is a broad vertical triangular plate of bone, with a smooth external surface
ON BRITISH FOSSIL REPTILES.  149

the alveolar borxler projects externally like a ridge, above -wliich the bone is
slightly concave. This ridge appears to be slightly dentated ; it overlaps
the corresponding alveolar border of the lower jaw. The posterior and su-
perior margin of the maxillary is slightly concave, and joins the malar and
lachrymal bones and a small part of the prefrontal : the anterior superior mar-
gin joins the upper half of the elongated intermaxillary, which divides it from
the nasal bones and the external nostril ; the lower side or base of the triangle,

M'hich forms the alveolar border, is convex.

   The most singular character of the cranium of the present fossil genus is
afforded by the intermaxillary bones. These, in their length and regular
downward curvature, give to the fore-part of the skull the physiognomy of

that of a parrot or accipitrine bird, but they differ essentially from both those
of the bird and lizard in being distinct from each other throughout their whole
length, and in gradually diminishing to their inferior extremity, which is not
expanded and continued laterally to form any part of the alveolar border of
the upper jaw. Each intermaxillary bone is a slender, subcompressed, elon-
gated bone, bent so as to describe a quarter of a circle ; the upper half is
thinner, but rather broader than the lower half, and is wedged in between
the superior maxillary, frontal and nasal bones ; the lower half, which is some-
what narrower but thicker, and is subcylindrical, projects freely doivnwards
beyond the superior maxillary bone; the deep anterior extremity or com-
pressed symphysis of the lower jaw is applied to the posterior surface of these
produced extremities of the two intermaxillaries, when the mouth is closed.

The two intermaxillaries converge towards each other from their posterior
origins, and are in close contact with each other, where they form the singular

curved projecting beak.

   The external nostril is single and situated between the upper diverging ends

of the intermaxillaries, but a fracture of the fossil at this part prevents the

precise form of this aperture, or the mode of termination of the nasal bones,
from being determined. The nasal bones, if not actually absent in the present
fossil, as in most Chelonians, must have been extremely small, as in the Cha-

meleons.

   The lower jaw is of considerable depth, and exceeds, as in most Saurians,
the length of the cranium. The articular cavity is deep and wide ; the angle
of the jaw is broken off directly behind this cavity on the left side, but is con-
tinued backwards beyond it for more than half an inch on the right side. The
ramus gradually expands in the vertical direction, and becomes thinner from
side to side, as it advances forwai'ds to about its middle part, which is just
behind the orbit, where it measures 11 lines in depth; it then begins gra-
dually to diminish vertically to the symphysis, which again slightly increases
vertically to its termination, which is obliquely truncated, much compressed
laterally, and applied against the deflected extremities of the produced inter-
maxillaries. The posterior half of the maxillary ramus is slightly convex ex-
ternally, the anterior narrower part is slightly concave ; the superior margin
describes a slight but graceful sigmoid curve, convex posteriorly, and con-
cave anteriorly, where it is applied to the convex alveolar border of the upper
maxillary bone, to the inner side of which it is closely adapted. The alve-

olar border forms an external, convex, projecting ridge, analogous to that of

the upper jaw. The composite structure of the lower jaw is very clearly dis-
played in the fossil. The articular piece is short, but is continued forward

as a slender process below the angular piece, as in the Varamis; the angular
piece is relatively larger than in the Varanus, and presents nearly the same

proportions as in the Thorictes. The supra-angular is larger, and occupies

the proportion of the jaw formed by the supra-angular and coronoid elements
 J50 REPORT 1841,

 in TJwrictes and other lizards : the opercular element extends further upon
 the outside of the jaw from its lower margin than in the existing lizards ; the
 Thorict.es again, in this respect, coming nearest to the Rhynchosaurus : the
 dentary element constitutes the rest of the outer part of the ramus, but not

 the slightest trace of teeth is discernible.

    The present singular and highly interesting cranium seems to have been
 preserved with the mouth in the naturally closed state, and the upper and
 lower jaws are in close contact. In this state we must suppose that they were
 originally buried in the sandy matrix which afterwards hardened around them;
 and since lizards, owing to the unlimited reproduction of their teeth, do not
 become edentulous by age, we must conclude that the state in which the
 Rhynchosaurus was buried, with its lower jaw in undisturbed articulation with

 the head, accorded with its natural condition, while living, so far as the less
 perishable hard parts of its masticatory organs were concerned. Neverthe-
 less, since a view of the inner side of the alveolar border of the jaws has not

 been obtained, we cannot be assured of the actual edentulous character of

this very singular Saurian ; for in the genera Agama and Chameleo the den-

 tal system, seen only from the outside of the jaws, is represented by mere den-
 tations of the alveolar border, and the anchylosed bases of the teeth, the crowns
 of which really form the dentations, are recognizable only by an inside view.
 The indications of the dental system are at any rate more obscure in the
 Rhynchosaurus than in any existing Lacertian ; the dentations of the upper
jaw are absolutely feebler than in the Chameleon, and no trace of them can
 be detected in the lower jaw, where they are strongest in the Chameleon.
 The absence of the coronoid process in the Rhynchosaurits, which is conspi-
 cuously developed in all existing lizards, corresponds with the unarmed con-
 dition of the jaw, and the resemblance of the Rhynchosaurus in this respect
to the Tesludo ( Chelys) ferox, would seem to indicate that the correspond-
ence extended to the toothless condition of the jaws. The resemblance of
the mouth to the compressed beak of certain sea-birds, the bending down of
the curved and elongated intermaxillaries, so as to be opposed to the deep
symphysial extremity of the lower jaw, are further indications that the ancient

Rhynchosaur may have had its jaws encased by a bony sheath, as in birds

and turtles.

   A small flattened triangular plate, which adhered to the posterior part of

the skull, was suspected by Dr. Ward to be a tooth ; it appeared to me, from

the character of the exposed surface, to have at least equal claims to be re-
garded as a dermal scute. In prepai'ing the mould of the cranium this part

was detached and lost, a circumstance M'hich I have much regretted, since it

prevented my applying to it the test of a microscopical examination.

   I proceed now briefly to notice the other portions of the skeleton, which,
from their size, texture, and community of stratum and locality, are with much

probability referable to the Rhynchosaurus.
    Considerable portions of two rami of two distinct lower jaws, in portions of

sandstone from the Grinsill quarries, show the same structure as that of the
jaw in the cranium above described ; the thick edentulous alveolar border is
bounded below on the outside by the longitudinal channel ; the lower border
of the ramus is thick and smoothly rounded, it is somewhat abruptly con-
stricted immediately behind the deflected extremity or symphysis. The struc-
ture of the bone is very compact ; the fractured end demonstrates the large

cavity, common in reptiles, which is included between the opercular and

dentary pieces.

   One piece of fine-grained sandstone contains a considerable proportion of

four of the dorsal vertebrae in a connected chain, which measures 1 inch 10
ON BRITISH FOSSIL REPTILES.                                              151

lines. Near this chain of four and a smaller part of a fifth vertebra, there

are portions of four ribs. These have a single, not a bifurcated head ; they
are subcompressed, slightly and pretty uniformly curved, and grooved longi-

tudinally on both sides ; the longest portion of rib measures 2 inches, follow-

ing the curvature. The same fragment of sandstone contains three flat bones,

which offer several striking modifications, whether they be compared with the

constituents of an os innoniinatum or of the scapular arch.

The most entire of the three bones consists of a thicker articular end

a long, broad and thin plate, forming the body of the bone ; and a mode-

rately long trihedral process, given off from the convex margin near the

articular end. In these characters the comparative anatomist conversant

with the modifications of the skeleton in recent and extinct Saurians will re-

cognize a resemblance to the scapula of the Iguanodou and Hylaeosaur, in

a minor degree to the ischium of the Crocodile, and somewhat more remote-

ly, to the pubis of the Tortoise. The trihedral process, in the second compa-

rison, would match the anterior pubic process of the Crocodile's ischium,

but the entire bone would differ from that of the Crocodile in the slender-

ness of the pubic process, in the greater breadth and less length of the body

of the bone, and in its extreme thinness ; it increases in thickness, however,

as in the Crocodile's ischium, towards the articular end. The correspond-

ence of the trihedral process of the bone in question with the long spinous

process of the Chelonian pubis, is less close than the one just discussed. If

the present well-marked bone of the Rhynchosaur be regarded as a scapula,

it is to that bone in the Dinosauria that it offers most resemblance ; and the
prismatic process would then correspond with the one sent off from the an-

terior part of the coracoid articular surface in the scapula of the Hylaeosaur

and Iguanodon. It is the concavity at the neck of the bone, at the side oppo-

site that from which the process is sent, which gives it a nearer resemblance

to the Dinosaurian scapula than to the Crocodilian ischium ; it differs from

the scapula of tlie Crocodile in having the posterior margin, beyond the neck,

straight instead of convex ; the corresponding margin in the ischium being

concave. The blade of the bone, considered as scapula, is broader and shorter

than in either the Dinosaurs or Crocodiles. Its outer surface is slightly con-

vex : supposing it to be placed vertically upon the thicker articular end, the

prismatic process is directed forwards and downwards. There are a few small

pits or inequalities near the neck or thick articular margin in the present fossil.

The outer surface of the plate is marked with extremely fine striae, radiating

from the neck.                                               18,L, m· .

--Coracoid. The remains of a thin and broad plate of bone, attached by a

short neck to an apparently articular thickened head or process, might be
compared with a coracoid, as it resembles, so far as it is preserved, the cora-

coid of lizards, more than it does any other known bone; there is not, how-

ever, the perforation near the articular surface. The breadth of the neck is

6 lines, that of tiie body of the bone which remains 13 lines ; the length, or
diameter at right angles to the above, is 10 lines ; the bone is tliinned off to

--an edge, which is gently convex.

proximal end, is nearly entire; it terminates by an irregular convex border,
not thinned off to an edge, but adapted to the formation of a joint, and to the
attachment of cartilage. The exposed surface of the expanded head is con-
cave from side to side., somev. hat resembling the expanded and bent pubic
plate in lizards. The opposite extremity is broken across ; it shows the com-
mencement of a slight longitudinal ri(lge near its middle part. This bone

bears most resemblance to a humerus, but I am at present unable to deter-

mine it unequivocally. If compared v.ith the left pubis of Lacertians, the
entire and bent extremity corresponds with the median portion of that bone

but the middle part or stem is much longer in the fossil, and the broken end,

which would agree with the acetabular end of the pubis, is too thin to have
entered into the formation of such a cavity in the fossil ; it likewise wants the
perforation which characterizes the pubis in lizards. The same thinness and
imperforate condition of the fractured end oppose the comjjarison of the pre-
sent bone with the coracoid of the Crocodile.

In the slab containing the above-described bones, there are other fragments

of bone, but too small and imperfect for profitable description. Those of

which I have endeavoured to make the form and analogies intelligible, though

evidently peculiar, as might be expected in a Saurian with so strange a head,

and perhaps with a hind-toe directed backwards as in birds, may be regarded

as, most probably, constituents of a strong and well-developed pectoral arch,

and a humerus ; and they indubitably indicate a mechanism for locomotion

on land, which would well agree with that of the animal that has left the im-

pressions of its footsteps upon the same sandstone.

 --Radius and Ulna. Another piece of coarse-grained sandstone from the

same quarry contains a series of seven or eight vertebrfe in a very fragmentary

state, also two or three ribs, rather more slender and not so distinctly grooved

as in the fine-grained slab, and the proximal extremities of two long bones,

which may be best compared with the radius and ulna. The shaft of the

radius is more slender than that of the ulna ; one side is flat, the other con-

vex ; it expands and assumes a subtrihedral figure, by the development of a

slight longitudinal ridge ; its proximal end is conipi-Cfscd and more suddenly

expanded ; its breadth is 2\ lines, that of the shaft of the bone is 1 line. The
impression, partly broken away in the stone, indicates the greater expansion

of the distal end of this bone, with a length of 1 inch 3 lines. The proximal

end of the ulna has a distinct trihedral figure, and the expanded extremity is

produced backwards, so as to indicate the olecranon; the breadth of the head

is 4 lines, that of the middle of the shaft is 2^ lines. There is a portion of a

broad and flat bone in this piece which may have belonged to the scapular

arch.

 --Ilium. In another piece of stone, with the other portion of the same chain

of five vcrtebrcB, there is a broad and flat bone, apparently terminating in a

long narroAv process at one end, which may be an ilium ; its length is indi-

cated to be at least 1 incii 7 lines.
-- AFemora.
             thin piece of burr or coarse-grained sandstone contains the

articular end of a broad and flat bone, in which the raised oblong surface of

the joint is divided by a smooth channel, and may be compared with the co-

tyloid portion of the ilium ; the same piece of stone contains the shafts of two

long bones, most probably femora. The length of the most perfect of these

is 2 inches, and this does not include the distal end ; the diameter of the

by the bones before described                                                                                                                           the  extremities of the  femora are spongy, but

   There are few genera of extinct reptiles of M'hich it is more desirable to
obtain the means of determining the precise modifications of the locomotive

extremities than the lilajnchosaurus. The fortunate preservation of the skull

has brought to light modifications of the Lacertine structure leading towards

Ciwlonia and Birds, which before were unknown ; the vertebra likewise ex-
hibit very interesting deviations from the Lacertian type. The entire recon-

struction of the skeleton of the Ehynchosaurus may be ultimately accom-

plished, if the same interest in the collection and preservation of the fossils

of the Grinsill quarries be continued, as has already produced so important

an accession to Palajontology through the well-directed zeal of Dr. Ogier

Ward and other members of the Literary and Scientific Association at

Shrewsbury.

Among the inferior or squamate Saurians there are two leading modifica-

tions in the mode of attachment of the teeth, the base of which may be either

anchylosed to the summit of an alveolar ridge, or to the bottom of an alveolar

groove, and supported by its lateral wall. These modifications are indicated

Arespectively by the terms " acrodont" and " pleurodont."                                                                                                                                third mode of

fixation is presented by some extinct Saurians, which, in other parts of their

organization, adhere to the squamate or Lacertine division of the order, the

teeth being implanted in sockets, cither loosely or confluent with the bony

walls of the cavity; these I have termed the "thecodont"* Lacertians: the

most ancient of all Saurians belong to this group.

 --Thecodontosaurus, Riley and Stutchbury. In the dolomitic conglomerate at

Redland near Bristol, a formation considered to belong to the oldest or lowest

division of the new red sandstone scries, remains of reptiles have been dis-

coveied by Dr. Riley and Mr. Stutchbury f, which are allied in the form of

their teeth to the typical Varanian Monitors, but differ in having the teeth

imbedded in                              distinct sockets                                                                                               to this condition, however, the  Varani, among

the squamate Saurians, make an approacii in the shallow cavities containing

the base of the teeth along the bottom of the alveolar groove.

In the ancient extinct genus in question the sockets are deeper, and the

inner alveolar wall is nearly as high as the outer one; the teeth are arranged

in a close-set series, slightly decreasing in size towards the posterior part of

which is subcylindrical. The pulp-cavity remains open in the base of the

crown. In their microscopic structure, the teeth of the Thecodontosaurus

closely correspond with that of tlie teeth of the Varamis, Monitor, and Me-

galosaurus. The body of the tooth consists of compact dentine, in which the

calcigerous tubes diverge from an open pulp-cavity at nearly right angles to

  the surface of the tooth ; they form a slight curve at their origin, with the
  concavity directed towards the base of the tooth ; then proceed straight, and
  at the periphery bend upwards in the contrary direction. The diameter of

  the calcigerous tube is sj^q*'^ °^ ^^ ^'^^^ ' ^^^^ breadth of the interspace of the

 tubes is g^jjjth of an inch. The crown of the tooth is invested Avith a simple

  coat of enamel.
     This microscopic examination of the structure of the teeth, which I have

 been enabled to make by the kindness of Mr. Stutehbury, satisfactorily esta-
 blishes the distinction between the Saurian of the Bristol conglomerate and
 the reptiles of the later member of the new red sandstone system in War-

--wickshire, which I have described under the name of Lubyrinthodon.
     Palceosaurus, Riley and Stutehbury. In the formation which contained
 the jaw and teeth of the Thecodontosaurus, two other teeth were separately
 discovered, differing from the preceding and from each other ; the crown of
 one of these teeth measuring 9 lines in length and 5 lines in breadth. It is
 compressed, pointed, with opposite trenchant and serrated margins ; but its

 breadth as compared with its length is so much greater than in the Thecodonto-
 saurus, that Dr. Riley and Mr. Stutehbury have founded upon it the gemxsPa-
 lceosaurus,and distinguish it by the specific name oiplatyodon, from the second
 tooth, which they refer to the same genus under the name of Palceosaurus
 cylindrodon. The portion of the tooth of the Palceosaurus cylindrodon which

 has been preserved, shows that the crown is sub-compressed and traversed by
 two opposite finely-serrated ridges, as in the Thecodontosaurus and Rho-
palodon ; its length is 5 lines, its breadth at the base 2 lines.

    The vertebrae associated with these teeth are biconcave, with the middle
 of the body more constricted, and terminal articular cavities rather deeper

 than in TeleosaWrus ; but they are chiefly remarkable for the depth of the
spinal canal at the middle of each vertebra, where it sinks into the substance
of the centrum ; thus the canal is wider, vertically, at the middle than at the
two ends of the vertebra : an analogous structure, but less marked, obtains in

the dorsal vertebrae of the Rhynchosaurus from the new red sandstone of

Shropshire.

    Besides deviating from existing lizards in the thecodont dentition and bi-
concave vertebrae, the ancient Saurians of the Magnesian conglomerate also
differed in having some of their ribs articulated by a head and tubercle to
two surfaces of the vertebra, as at the anterior part of the chest in Crocodiles
and Dinosaurs. The shaft of the rib was traversed, as in the Ichthyosaur

and Rhynchosaur, by a deep longitudinal groove. Some fragmentary bones

indicate obscurely that the pectoral arch deviated from the Crocodilian and
approached the Lacertian or Enaliosaurian type in the presence of a clavicle
and in the breadth and complicated form of the coracoid. The humerus ap-
pears to have been little more than half the length of the femur, and to have
been, like that of the Rhynchosaurus, unusually expanded at the two extre-
mities. The femur is thus described by the discoverers of the present the-
codont reptiles :

   " Two femurs, in a tolerable state of perfection, have fortunately been

found ; one, of the right side, exhibiting nearly the whole of the bone, the
inferior condyles only wanting ; the other is the left, and exhibits the con-

dyles, but is very imperfect at the superior extremity. The first mentioned

measures 10 inches in length ; from the head to the middle of the trochanter
3 inches j^ths ; from the trochanter to the inferior condyle 5 inches /^ths.
In the left femur the transverse diameter of the condyles is 2 inches y%ths
the centre of the cylinder 1 inch. They are curved in two directions upon

the axis, giving them somewhat a twisted form, or the shape of a long/an-
tero-posteriorly. The trochanter is well preserved, wedge-sliaped, and of
considerable size, as may be seen by reference to the figures. The articular
head is flattened at the space between the trochanter, and the articular ex-
tremity is more curved than any other part of the bone : the centre is nearly
round, but a slight elevation or ridge exists on its posterior surface, in the
situation of the linea aspera of the human femur. The condyles are flat-
tened, the outer one being the larger ; there is a deep depression between
them posteriorly, and a very slight one anteriorly.

   " On an attentive comparison of these femurs with those of the Crocodile
and Megalosaurus, we again recognise a resemblauce. A comparison with

the femurs of the Monitors evidently shows that our animal cannot have be-

longed to that family. The femurs of the Monitor are much less curved,
being nearly straight, and the trochanter is much nearer the articular ex-

tremity ; characters sufficiently showing a wide diff"erence between them."
   The tibia, fibula, and metatarsal bones manifest, like the femur, the fitness

of the thecodont Saurians for progression on land. The ungual phalanges
are sub-compressed ; curved downwards, pointed, and impressed on each

side with the usual curved canal.

   The general conclusions which may be drawn from the knowledge at pi^e-

sent possessed of the osteology of the Thecodontosauriis and PalcEosaurus,
the antiquity of which the discoverers of these genera regard as being greater
than that of any other vertebrated animals, excepting fishes, are, that in their
thecodont type of dentition, biconcave vertebrae, double-jointed ribs, and pro-

portionate size of the bones of the extremities, they are nearly allied to the
Teleosaurus ; but that they combine a Lacertian form of tooth, and structure

of the pectoral and probably pelvic arch with these Crocodilian cliaracters,
having distinctive modifications, as the moniliform spinal canal, in which,
however, the almost contemporary Rhynchosaur participates. It would be
interesting to ascertain whether the caudal vertebrae are characterized, as in
the Thuringian Protorosaur, by double diverging spinous processes*.

  --Cludyodon, nob. In the new red sandstone (Keuper?) of Warwick and

Leamington, there occur detached, pointed, trenchant, recurved teeth, the
crowns of which are sometimes 1 inch 4 lines in length, and 5 lines across the
base : they have been found in the same quarries as those containing the re-
mains of the LabyrinthodoH. In their compressed form, anterior and posterior
serrated edges, sharp points, and microscopic structure, these teeth agree with

those of the Saurian reptiles of the Bristol conglomerate. In their breadth, as

compared with their length and thickness, they are intermediate between the
Thecodontosauriis and the Palccosaiiriis platyodon ; but they are larger, with
longer and more recurved crowns, and thus more nearly approach the form

characteristic of the teeth of the Megalosaurus\. From these teeth, however,

they differ in their greater degree of compression, and in a slight contraction
at the base of the crown ; I therefore indicate the genus, of which, as yet, only
the teeth are known, by the name of Cladyodon, and the species from the
Warwickshire sandstones by the name of Cladyodon Lloydii, in testimony
of the friendly aid of Dr. Lloyd of Leamington, to whose zealous co-opera-
tion I owe the materials for the description of the teeth of the present genus,
and the still more remarkable ones of the British species of Labyrinthodon,
with which tiie teeth of the Cludyodon are associated.

   * This structure I have ascertained in the original specimen described by Spener, now
preserved in the Iliiiiterian Museum.

   t One of the teeth of the Cladyodon is figured in the Memoir of Messrs. Murchison and
Strickland on the Warwick Sandstones, Geol. Trans., second series, vol. v. pi. xxviii. fig. 6.

                     Order PTEROSAURIA.

   The term Ornithocephalus, originally imposed by Soemmering on the genus

Pterodactjjlus, Cuv,, which is the typo of the present extinct order of reptiles,

would be much more applicable to the RJti/nchosaurus ; for although a more
striking approach to the class of birds is made by the modification of the
pectoral extremity which endowed the Pterodactyle with the power of flight,

it is precisely in the structure of the cranium that it adheres most closely to

the ordinary Saurian type of structure.

   The genus Pterodactylus was ranked among the swimming-birds by Blu-
menbach, with the clieiropterous Mammalia (Bats) by Hermann and Soem-

mering, and has been proved to belong to the order of Reptiles by Cuvier,
The Pterodactylus longirostris, from the lithographic slate of Pappenheim,
was the earliest known species ; the Pter, hrevirostris, Pter. medius, and Pter.
grandisy were next established, and subsequently the British species Pter. ma-
cronyx was determined by Dr. Buckland, from remains discovei'ed in the lias

of Lyme Regis, and which, before they came under the discriminative glance

of the Oxford Professor, had passed as the bones of birds.

   Of this species Dr. Buckland describes the principal bones of the extremi-
ties, and several vertebrae ; the cranium has not yet been discovered. The
valuable subject of th^ Professor's memoir is deposited in the British Mu-
seum ; the Memoir is contained in the thii'd volume of the second series of

the Transactions of the Geological Society, and an accurate figure of the

specimen is given, of the size of nature, at plate xxvii.*

   A second stratum, in which the remains of Pterodactyles have been de-

tected by Dr. Buckland, is the oolite slate of Stonesfield. Some fine speci-
mens of the lohg bones of the extremities of Pterodactyles from that locality,
in the collection of John Hunter, were referred by that celebrated anatomist

to the class of birds.

                     Sauria IncertjE Sedis.

-- APohjptychodon.  large species of Saurian is indicated by thick conical

teeth, having the general character of those of the Crocodile, but distin-

guished by numerous, closely-set, longitudinal ridges, M'hich are continued, of

nearly equal length, to within 2 lines of the apex of the crown. These teeth

have been described and figured in my ' Odontography' under the name of

Pohjptycliodon. In their size and general form these Saurian teeth resemble

those of the great sauroid fish, Hypsodon, Ag., but may be distinguished by

the solidity of the crown, and the conformity of the structure of the dentine

with tliat of the Crocodiles ; also by the ridges on the exterior of the crown

of the Hypsodon's teeth being alternately long and short, and terminating

abruptly at difierent but commonly greater distances from the apex than in

PolyjJtychodon, the interspaces between the longer ridges widening as they

approach the apex. The tooth of the Pohjptychodon is slightly and regu-

larly curved, and invested Avith a moderately thick layer of enamel, of which

substance the ridges are composed, the surface of the outermost layer of den-

Atine being smooth.  tooth of this reptile from the lower greensaud

(Kentish-rag quarries) near Maidstone, in the collection of Mr. Benstead of

that townf, has a crown 3 inches long, and 1 inch 4 lines across the base.

imposed thin hollow cones, and the short and wide conical pulp-cavity is con-

fined to the base or fang. The cavity of the tooth in Hypsodon would ap-
pear to have been much larger, as it is in many predatory iishes, in which the
teeth are more rapidly shed and renewed than in Crocodilian reptiles.

   The teeth of Poli/ptychodon differ from those supposed to have belonged
to Poiliilopleuron, in the ridges of the crown being more numerous and close

set, and in the transverse section being nearly circular instead of being ellip-
tical : from the teeth of Pliosaurus those of Polyptychodon differ in being
round and not three-sided, and in having longitudinal ridges over the whole
surface of the crown ; and from the teeth of 3Iosasaurus they differ in being
ridged and not smooth.

          Gigantic Fossil Saurian from the Lower Greensand at Hytlie.

   Under this head I have to notice some remains of a Saurian of marine
habits, but most probably of the Crocodilian order, as gigantic as the Ceiio-
saurus or Polyptychodon, but, in the absence of dental and vertebral charac-
ters, not referable to any known genus. These remains were discovered by
H. B. Mackeson, Esq. of Hythe, in the greensand quarries near that town,
and include portions of the iliac, ischial and pubic bones, a large proportion
of the shaft of a femur, parts of a tibia and fibula, and several metatarsal
bones. In consequence of the absence of vertebras and teeth, the present ob-
servations will be limited to indicating the characters by which these remains
differ from previously known extinct genera of Saurians. In the first place,
as the femur and other long bones have no medullary cavities, but a central
structure composed of coarse cancelli, it is evident that the animal of which
they formed part was of marine habits ; but the best- preserved bone being a
femur, this circumstance, independently of the size and shape of the metatar-

sals, at once negatives the idea that these remains belonged to the Cetacean
order, whilst the form and proportions of the metatarsals equally forbid their

--reference to any other Mammalian genus.
   Femur. The portions of this bone secured by Mr. Mackeson include
about the two distal thirds, excepting the articular extremity ; its length is
2 feet 4 inches ; its circumference in the middle, or smallest part of the shaft,
is 15 inchec 6 lines, and at the broken distal end, 2 feet 5 inches. These
dimensions prove that the animal was equal to the most gigantic described
Iguanodon*. If the supposition of the proportion of the femur which has

been preserved be right, this bone differs from that of the Iguanodon, not
only in the want of a medullary cavity, but also in the absence of the compressed

process which projects from the inner side of the middle of the shaft. The
bone also expands more gradually than in the femur of the Iguanodon, and
the posterior jiart of the condyles nmst have been wider apart in conse-

quence of the posterior inter-condyloid longitudinal excavation being longer
and wider.

  --Tibia and Fibula. The portion of a tibia which has been preserved is

compressed near its head, and the side next to the fibula is slightly concave.

The longest transverse diameter is 8 inches 9 lines, and the two other trans-

 verse diameters at right angles to the preceding, give respectively 3 inches

3 lines, and 2 inches 6 lines. The bone soon assumes a thicker form, its cir-

 cumference at about one-third from its proximal end being 16 inches G lines.

 The cancelli occupying the central portion of the bone are arranged in a suc-

 cession of layers around a point nearest tlie narrower end of tlie transverse
section. Lower down the tibia again becomes compi*essed, and towards the

 smallest circumference I foot 10 inches.
158 REPORT-- 1841.

distal end the transverse section exhibits the form of a plate bent towards the

fibula, and its narrowest transverse diameter is 2| inches.
   The portion of tlie fibula is 11^ inches long. In the middle it is flat on

one side, slightly concave on another, and convex on the two remaining sides.

It presents the same cancellous structure as the tibia, but the concentric ar-
rangement of the layers of cells is more exact. Towards the opposite end of
the bone the concave side becomes first flat, and is then produced into a con-
vex wall, terminating one end of a transverse section of a compressed and

--bent thick plate of bone.
    Metatarsals. These bones exhibit the characteristic irregularity of length

of the Crocodilian metatarsals. Of two imbedded in the rock, and apparently

the innermost and second, of the left hind-foot, the former or smaller measured
1 foot in length and the latter 2 feet, having a diameter of 8 inches at its
greater end, and of 4 inches 5 lines at its narrowest or middle part, and of

G inches at its other extremity, Avhich was imperfect. The whole of the bone
within the compact outer crust consisted of cells varying from a half to two-

thirds of a line in diameter. Portions of four other detached metatarsals are

--described.
   Ilia, Ischia, Pubis, and Coracoid Bone. These bones conform in the main
to the Eiialiosaurian type. The remains of the ilia are flat and nearly straight,
and they gradually but slightly widen towards one end. Of one ilium a por-
tion, 25 inches long and 10 inches across at the broadest end, is preserved,
and of the other a I'ragment 20 inches in length.

   The mesial extremities of the pubis and ischium are preserved in the same
block of stone. The pubis differs from the Crocodilian type in its greater
breadth. The portion exposed in this block is principally convex, but it be-
comes concave towards the opposite or median margin. At its broadest part
it is 13 inches across, and its length is 17 inches. This expanded extremity
is rounded, and the diameter of the corresponding expanded extremity of the
ischium, which is obliquely truncated, is 9 inches. In another block of stone
the expanded extremity of the opposite pubis is preserved, and measures 14

inches across and 22 inches in length.
   The bone which bears most resemblance to a coracoid is 2 feet in length

and 17 inches in its greatest breadth, and it varies in thickness from 3 to 5
inches. The breadth of this bone indicates the great development of the

muscles destined for the movement of the fore-leg, whence it may be inferred
that the anterior extremities were more powerfully and habitually used in pro-

gressive motion than in the Teleosaurian Crocodiles.
    It will be sufficiently apparent, from the brief notice of the principal cha-

racters of these interesting remains here given, that they cannot have be-
longed to any of the genera of the great ambulatory terrestrial Dinosaurs
and, on the other hand, the length, thickness, and form of the condyles of
the femur, and the size and shape of the metatarsal bones equally remove the
Enaliosaurs from the pale of comparison.

    There then remain, as claimants of the fossils in question, first, the great
Mosasaunis of the Cretaceous formations, the locomotive extremities of
which have not been yet discovered ; secondly, the equally gigantic Cetio-
saurus brcvis, associated with the lyuanodon in the Wealden, and, from its
or"-anization, more likely than the Iguanodon to be found in later marine de-

posits ; finally, the Reptile of the Maidstone greensand, to which the name of

Polyptychodon has been provisionally assigned from the configuration of its
teeth. But, since the teeth of the geims Cetiosaurus are not yet determined,
the identity of this genus with Polyptychodon is open to suspicion ; and sub-

sequent discoveries may demonstrate that the great Saurian of the Hythe

greensand indicated by bones of the extremities, that of the Maidstone
greensand by its teeth, and that of the Wealden formation recognized by
its vertebrae, are all parts of the same extinct reptile.

Genus Rysosteus, nob.

    I have been favoured by Mr. Johnson of Bristol, with the opportunity of
examining a small anterior dorsal vertebra, (No. 177, of his interesting Col-
lection,) half imbedded in its pyritic matrix, from the Bone-bed of Aust Pas-
sage, near Bristol.

    Both articular ends of the body of this vertebra are concave, but deeper
than in Teleosaurus, with a central short transverse linear impression. The
lower part of the side of the body is raised into an obtuse longitudinal ridge,
above which, between it and the transverse process, is a wide but not deep
depression. The centrum slightly expands to the two extremities, which have
a circular contour. The transverse process is broken off: its base, which is
as deep as long, rests in a small proportion upon the centrum, but chiefly upon
the side of the neurapophysis, the limits of which are not defined by a per-
sistent suture. The neural arch rests upon the whole antero-posterior extent
of the upper part of the centrum, rises nearly vertically to a height not quite
equal to that of the centrum, then slopes abruptly inwards to support the base
of the spine. This is nearly equal in antero-posterior extent to the centrum,
and slightly increases in that direction by inclining over the interspace of the
posterior oblique processes : it also slightly gains in thickness, and is termi-
nated by a flat and rough surface, the contour of which is nearly parallel with
that of the under surface of the centrum. The sides of the spine for two lines
below the summit are wrinkled* or impressed by vertical or slightly oblique
coarse grooves. The posterior oblique process is moderately long and slender
its flat elliptical articular surface looks downwards and slightly outwards. The
non-articular surfaces of the vertebra are smooth, except near the summit of
the spine, the lateral ridges and grooves of which form the chief characteristic

of the present vertebra.
    This vertebra, though it resembles those of a few species of Plesiosaur in

the depth of its terminal articular surfaces, difl'ers too much in its length and

lateral compression to be referable to that genus ; the rough and thick trun-
cated summit of the spinous process rather indicates the species to have be-
longed to the loricate family of Saurians. It diflPers from the vertebrae of the
Teleosaur and other known Amphicoelian Crocodiles in the form and verti-
cal thickness of the transverse processes, in the lateral longitudinal ridge of
the centrum, and in the antero-posterior extent and form of the spinous pro-
cess. It difl'ers from the vertebrae of the Labyrinthodon in the articidar ends
being at right angles to the axis of the centrum and not oblique ; in the greater
vertical thickness of the transverse process ; and in the spine not being sud-
denly expanded and flattened at the summit, as in the dorsal vertebrae of the
Labyrinthodon.

bury Cliff, on the Severn, eiglit miles from Gloucester.

   Two spinous processes of fractured vertebrae are conspicuous and readily re-

cognizable by their wrinkled surface and great antero-posterior extent; they
agree also in size with the vertebra from Aust Passage, and seem to be evi-
dently of the same species.

   The distal end of a Saurian humerus and a nearly entire femur are asso-
ciated with these vertebral fragments. The humerus has an angular and
twisted shaft, and greatly expanded articular extremities, the surface of which
is ridged like the spinous processes, but with somewhat wider intervals.

   The femur equals the length of three vertebrse and a half; resembles that
of the Teleosaurus in shape, but has the outer surface of the expanded ex-
tremities wrinkled, though in a minor degree than in tlie humerus. The cor-
respondence of the long bones in size, and in the wrinkled character of part

of their surface with the vertebras, almost demonstrates that they belong to
the same species of Saurian.

at the quarries of Craigs, two miles east of the town of Dumfries, are regarded
by Dr. Buckland as bearing most resemblance to the foot-prints of a small

in the oolitic slate of Stonesfield, and leave a light brown stain upon the matrix.

of the concentric lines with those of existing tortoisesf, that the position which

they originally held on the carapace may often be determined.

Emydian Chelonite from the Eocene clay near Harwich, which differs from
the Emys testudiniformis of Sheppey in its flatter figure.

   The carapace is elliptical, gently convex at the middle and concave at the
sides, the margins being slightly raised. The external surface of i\\e osseous

buckler is slightly rugous ; the length of the carapace is 11 inches ; its breadth
at the suture between the fifth and sixth rib is 10 inches.

   The first vertebral plate is nearly flat ; the middle part of its posterior
margin extends backwards about one line and a half. The second vertebral

plate is of an oblong quadrangular figure, 6 lines in breadth : the third ver-
tebral plate is six-sided and 8 lines in breadth, the two anterior sides being
the shortest : the tenth and eleventh vertebral plates are broad.

but the superincumbent expanded portions and their sutures are continued as

                                                         Emys de Sheppey, Cuv. ?

Most of the Chelonites from the Eocene clay of Sheppey belong to the ma-

rine family* of the order, from which the present species differs in the depth

of the bony cuirass, the convexity of the carapace, the concavity of the plas-

tron, and the extent of ossification of both these parts. The more immediate

affinities of the present fossil are elucidated by the comparison of the points

of structure which it displays with the anatomical characters of the carapace

of the Emys and Testudo.

The specimen, on which the species Emys testudiniformis is founded, in-

cludes a large proportion of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth,

with a fragment of the seventh expanded vertebral ribs of the left side ; a

small proportion of the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth vertebral plates

the hyo- and hyposternals, and part of the entosternal bones of the plastron.

The first rib is 1 inch 10 lines, in greatest breadth ; 1 inch 5 lines broad

at its junction with the vertebral plates, and four-fifths of the vertebral mar-

gin is articulated with the second vertebral plate ; one-fifth part, divided by

an angle from the preceding, joins a corresponding side of the lateral angle

of the third vertebral plate ; in this structure it resembles both the genus

Testudx) and some species of Emys.

The third, fourth, fifth and sixth vertebral plates are of equal breadth as

in Emydes                                                not alternately broad and narrow as in the  Testudines :   they are
                                                      ;

likewise of uniform figure, as in most Emydes ; not variable, as in Testudines :

the vertebral plates also resemble those of the existing Emydes, and particu-

larly of the Box-terrapin (^Cistudo) in form. The lateral margin of each is

bounded by two'lines, meeting at an open angle, the anterior line is only one-

fourth part the length of the posterior one ; and this resemblance may be stated

with confidence, since the portion of the entosternal piece preserved in the

plastron determines the anterior part of the fossil.

   The ribs preserved in the present Chelonite differ from the corresponding

ones of the Tortoises and resemble those of the Emydes in their regular

breadth, and the uniform figure of the extremities articulated with the ver-

tebral pieces ; the anterior line of the angular extremity is nearly three times

as long as the posterior one.

Further evidence of the relation of the present Chelonite to the freshwater

family is given by the impressions of the epidermal scutes : those covering

the vertebral plates {scuta vertebralia) agree with those of most Emydians

in the very sligiit production of the angle at the middle of their lateral mar-

gins, which is bounded by a line running parallel with the axis of the cara-

pace, except wliere it bends out to form that small angle.

The middle part of each side of the plastron, in the Emys testudiniformis,

is joined to the carapace by a strong and uninterrupted bony wall, continued

from a large proportion of the hyo- and hyposternal bones upwards to the mar-

ginal costal pieces. The median margin of the hyo- and hyposternals are ar-

ticulated together by a linear suture, traversing the median line of the plas-

tron, and only broken by a slight angle formed by the right hyposternal, whicli

Ais a little larger than the left.                       similar inequality is not unusual in both Tor-

toises and Emydes. The transverse suture is, of course, broken by the same

IS'il.                                                   * See Proceedings of the Geological Society, Dec. 1, 184L

inequality ; that portion which runs between the left hj'^o- and hyposternals
being two or three lines in advance of the one between the I'ight hyo- and
hyposternals. The posterior half of the broad entosternal piece is articulated
to a semicircular emargination at the middle of the hyosternals ; so that the
whole plastron forms one continuous plate of bone. This is relatively thicker
than in existing Emydes, resembling in its strength that of Tortoises ; and it

is likewise slightly concave in the middle, which structure is more common in

Tortoises than in Emydians, save those in which the sternum is moveable ; in
most of the other species the sternum is flat or slightly convex.

   I have shown in my paper on the Turtles of Sheppey *, that the carapace

figured by Cuvierf was not sufliiciently perfect to decide, the affinities of the
Chelonian to which it belonged ; if the vertebral scutes were less broad and

--angular than in marine turtles, the vertebral plates much less variable in
--their proportions were, on the other hand, as narrow as in turtles. But with

reference to the plastron of the Sheppey Chelonite, figured by Parkinson I,

and supposed by Cuvier to belong to an Emys of the same species as the ca-

rapace above alluded to, I have been able to determine, by an examination

of the original specimen in the museum of Prof. Bell, that it belonged to the

marine genus Chelone and to the species lovglceps. In the fossil JEmys in

Mr. Bowerbank's collection, the plastron being in great part preserved, esta-
blishes its nonconformity with the marine turtles, and manifests a striking

diff'erence from Parkinson's fossil plastron.

   The entosternal piece is impressed, as in Tortoises and Emydes, by a me-

dian longitudinal furrow; a transverse linear impression traverses the hyoster-

nals half an inch behind the suture of the entosternal; the second transverse
line is not so near the first as in Tortoises, but bears the same relation to the

transverse suture of the plastron as in most Emydes ; it does not pass straight
across the plastron, but the right half inclines obliquely inward to a more
posterior part of the median suture than is touched by the left half. The

third transverse line passes straight across the plastron between the posterior
ends of the bony lateral walls, uniting the carapace and plastron.

   In the convexity of the carapace and relative depth of the osseous box the
Sheppey Chelonite slightly surpasses most existing species, resembling in this
respect the JEmys ocellata and Cistudo Carolina. The plastron is also slightly
concave, as in the male of Cistudo vulgaris : it is, however, entire at the line
where the transverse joint of the plastron exists in the Box-tortoises; and the
extent and firm ossification of the lateral supporting walls of the carapace for-
bid likewise a I'eference of the fossil to those genera. The general characters
of the present fossil, more especially the uniformity of size and breadth of the
preserved vertebral plates and ribs, prove it to be essentially related to the
freshwater or Emydian Tortoises. It exceeded in size, however, almost all
known Emydians, and was almost double the dimensions of the Emydian spe-

cies ( Cistudo Europea^ now inhabiting central Europe. It appears, like the

Cistudines, to have approached the form of the land-tortoises, in the convexity
of the carapace, but without possessing that division and hinge of the plastron
which peculiarly distinguishes the box-tortoises. In the thickness and strength

Assuming that the Chelonite here described may be identical with that of

which the carapace from Mr. Crow's collection is figured in the ' Ossemens

Fossiles*,' the 'Emys de Sheppey' of Cuvier will be one of the ' Synonyms' of

the present species. Mr. Gray, in his ' Synopsis Reptilium,' has given Latin

names to all the fossil reptiles indicated or established by Cuvier, and has

called  the  '  Emys  de  Sheppey                                              ' Emys  Parkinsonii,'  referring  as  representa-

tions of this species, not to the figure of the carapace above cited, which may

belong to the same species as the present Emys, but to the figure of the

plastron, copied by Cuvier from ' Parkinson's Organic Remains,' and to the

figure of the skull in the same work, both of which most unquestionably be-

long to the genus Chelone and not to the genus Emys.

  --The ' Emys Parkinsonii ' of Mr. Gray is a synonym of my Chelone longiceps.

Cuvier's name, which, besides the claim of priority, is the honest result of

--labour devoted to the elucidation of its subject, if rendered into Latin would

be Emys toliapicus ; but as the species to which it refers may not be the one

here described, and is not the only freshwater tortoise which the clay of

Sheppey has yielded ; and since the characters of the present species have

not, hitlierto, been defined nor its affinities to the land-tortoises been pointed

out, the interests of science, it appears to me, will be best consulted by naming

the present species Emys testudiniformis.

The fossil here described is from the Eocene clay of Sheppey Island, and

--forms part of the collection of J. S. Bowerbank, Esq.
   Platemys Boiverbankii, nob Another specimen from the same rich col-

lection of Sheppey remains actually indicates a distinct species of the fresh-

water family of Chelonia, which from its more depressed figure, its size, and

the general form of the sternum, most probably belonged to the Platemydian

division of that family f.

   The sternum is 13 inches in length and 10 inches in breadth ; it is

broader before than behind, rounded in front, notched behind : the surface

is nearly flat, slightly convex at the anterior part, and as slightly concave

behind.

The lateral bony wall or ala uniting the plastron to the carapace is 5 inches

in length or antero-posterior extent, and it commences 3 inches behind the

anterior extremity of the plastron. The episternals meet in advance of the

entosternal, the length of the suture joining their anterior extremities, being

7 lines : from the peripheral end of this suture to that of the suture between

the episternal and hyosternal bones is 2 inches 6 lines : from the latter suture

to the anterior concavity of the lateral wall is 5 lines. In a tortoise with a

plastron 13 inches long, the length of the same suture was 1^ inch, and the
suture between the episternal and hyosternal bones is nearer the lateral wall.

The Emydes, especially Emys {Platemys) depressa, most resembles the fossil,

especially in the more important character of the relative length of the lateral

wall and suture.

The carapace presents the same conformation and regularity of size of the

Emysvertebral plates and ribs as in the                                                testudiniformis ; but it is flat, even

slightly concave along the middle tract ; and has somewhat narrower verte-

bral plates, of which the third to the eighth may be distinguished in the fos-

sil ; the ninth being concealed by the union of the vertebral extremities of

the 7th pair of expanded ribs.

In the circumstance of the vertebral plates in this fossil decreasing in length

without losing breadth, as well as in the junction of the seventh pair of ribs,

the present fossil resembles the Sheppey carapace from Mr. Crow's collection

figured by Cuvier ; which may, therefore, have belonged to the present spe-

pey was obtained by the British Museum at the sale of Bullock's collection,

the plastron and the lateral alae or uniting wall. The following are dimen-

sions of this specimen :                                        In. Lines.

   The anterior contour of the sternum is rounded ; the posterior termination
is notched. The lateral wall extends horizontally, almost parallel with the
plane of the sternum, and expands to join, by a wavy suture, the marginal
plates ; six of these are preserved on each side ; their lower margins form a
very open angle. The anterior part of the entosternum is bounded by two

nearly straight lines, converging forwards at an angle of 65°, with the apex

rounded off; the posterior contour of this bone is semicircular. The length

of the entosternal is 2 inches 10 lines ; its breadth 3 inches 7 lines.

   The chief peculiarity of this plastron is the intercalation of a supernume-
rary piece of bone between the hyosternal and hyposternal elements, on each
side ; so that the plastron is crossed by two transverse sutures, instead of one ;
each suture being similarly interrupted in the middle by an angular deflection
from the right, half an inch back, to the left side. The extremities of the
transverse sutures terminate each at the apex formed by the inner or lower
border of the parallel marginal plates. The first or anterior of these sutures

is distant from the anterior margin of the plastron 6 inches 5 lines : the second
suture is distant from the same margin 8 inches 9 lines : the right half of the
suture, which is a few lines in advance of the left, is the part from which
these measurements are taken.

    It might be suspected that the transverse impressions of the second or third
pairs of sternal scutes had liere been mistaken for a suture ; but due care was
observed to avoid this error: the sternal scutes have left obvious impressions,
which prove that they were in the same number as in the Platemydians ge-
nerally, and quite distinct from the sutures in question.
ON BRITISH FOSSIL REPTILES.  165

   Thus the first median scute is in the form of an ancient shield ; its posterior
apex impressing and crossing the anterior apex of the entosternum. The pos-
terior transverse boundary of the succeeding pair of sternal scutes crosses the
plastron 4^ inches from its anterior margin ; that of the third pair of scutes
crosses at 7| inches from the anterior border, and between the two transverse
sutures ; that of the fourth pair at 10 inches distance from the anterior mar-
gin, and about 1^ inch behind the second transverse suture ; passing straight
across the plastron between the posterior concave margins of the lateral walls.
The posterior boundary of the fifth pair of scutes inclines obliquely back-
wards from the median line, as usual ; it is 3 inches behind the preceding

transverse impression.
    It is in the interspace of these impressions that traces of the transverse su-

ture between the hyposternals and xiphisternals are obvious, about 4 inches
from the posterior extremity of the plastron. If these traces were not so ob-
vious, it might be supposed that the xiphisternals were of unusual length,
entering into the formation of the lateral wall, and extending backwards from
the second transverse suture to the end of the plastron ; but this disproportion
would be hardly less anomalous than the existence of the additional pair of
bones intercalated between the hyo- and hyposternals which this present fossil

evidently displays.

   In most of the existing large Emydes and Platemydes, the median transverse

suture traverses the plastron a little behind the third pair of scutes, or across
the fourth pair ; so that the second transverse suture in the fossil has the ana-
logous position, and accordingly has most right to be regarded as the normal

boundary between the hyo- and hyposternals. One of the most distinctive

characters of the present extinct Platemys is, therefore, the division of each
hyosternal bone into two, the sternum consisting of eleven instead of nine
pieces ; if the very interesting anomaly which it displays be not an accidental

or individual variety.

   The chief difference in regard to the sternal scutes, is the addition of two

small ones anteriorly, one on each side of the median anterior pair in the

fossil.

   The obtuse ridge which forms the angle between the carapace and plas-

--tron is preserved in the fossil.
    Tretosternon punctatum, nob. In the rich collection of fossil remains be-
longing to Sir P. Egerton, there is the posterior part of the carapace of a fine
species of freshwater tortoise, which, by its broad and extremely flattened
form and sculptured surface, is evidently closely allied to the genus Trionyx,
but which, from the impressions of distinct horny scutes, is essentially related

to the Emydian family, and is nearly allied to the genus Platemys, D. & B.

(^Hydraspis, Bell.) : this portion of carapace contains the fifth to the twelfth
vertebral plates inclusive, and the five posterior pairs of expanded vertebral

ribs. The external surface of both elements of the carapace is closely pitted
with minute irregular impressions, smaller than a pin's head, and along their
sutural margins for the extent of two or three lines by straight and parallel

linear impressions, at right angles or nearly so to those margins : the pin-
head impressions are sparing or absent at these striated margins.

   The breadth of the carapace, across the fourth pair of ribs, is 13|^ inches

the length of the moiety of the carapace here preserved is 9 inches : the en-

tire length would be, probably, 17 inches. The flattened ribs gradually ex-
pand towards their distal extremity.

   The close resemblance which this species makes to the Trionyces, in the

sculpturing of the external surface of the carapace, is very striking ; but the
impressions of the horny scutes, and the non-continuation of a narrow tooth-
--166 REPORT 1841.

like portion of the rib from the distal end of the expanded part, are essential

distinctions.

    The entire and rounded terminal margins of the truncated and expanded
extremities of the ribs, beyond which there is not the slightest trace of pro-
jecting tooth-lilce processes, strongly indicates that the marginal plates were

either wanting or rudimental, as in the genus Cryptopus,
    This fossil is from the Purbeck limestone.
    In the collection of Mr, Bowerbank is preserved the left half of the plas-

tron of the same species of freshwater tortoise, from the Purbeck limestone,
at Swanage, equal in size and probably of the same species as the preceding,
but with fainter impressions on the external surface. This Chelonite includes
the hyosternal, the hyposternal, and a considerable part of the xiphisternal
bones, but wants the extremity of this bone. It is a very remarkable and
characteristic fossil, chiefly on account of the great extent of the lateral wall,
which is continued outwards, in the same plane with the rest of the plastron,
as in the Emydian subgenus Platysternon, Gray, accompanied by an unusual
width of the notches, anterior and posterior to this wall, for the emergence of
the fore and hind-feet. The length of this fossil, taken along the median su-
ture, is 13 inches; the breadth of the sternum along the median transverse
suture must have exceeded 12 inches. The antero-posterior extent of the
contracted part of the lateral wall is 7 inches ; that of its expanded outermost
part 9 inches ; the antero-posterior diameter of the hyposternal bone 4 inches
4 lines ; extent of transverse suture between this and the xiphisternal 3 inches.
The outer and anterior angle of the xiphisternal has a shallow angular notch
which receives a corresponding process of the hyposternal : the median mar-
gin of the hyposternal has a semicircular piece cut out of it just where it joins
 the hyosternal : the bone gradually narrows off to the edge of this emargi-
nation, which is exposed, by a careful removal of the matrix, without any

trace of fracture of the bone. If it be, as it seems, a natural structure, then

the centre of the sternum must have presented an elliptical vacuity, closed by
membrane or cartilage of nearly two inches diameter, situated immediately
 behind the transverse suture uniting the hyo- and hyposternals. Such an ap-
proximation to the Trionyces and Chelones presented by an extinct species,
 which from the extensive lateral union by a continuous bony plate of the side
 of the plastron with the carapace, and from the complete ossification of the
latter is essentially an Emydian species, forms a very interesting transitional
 modification, especially if it be combined, as there seems good reason to be-
 lieve, with the sculptured surface of a remarkably flattened carapace, such as
 the Chelonite, in Sir P. Egerton's collection, from the same stratum and loca-

 lity presents.

    The sternum, like the carapace above mentioned, is impressed by the mar-

 gins of distinct scutes.

    The transverse line bounding the second sternal scute has the same rela-
 tive position as in the Testudo Schweigeri and Platemys planiceps. The two
 succeeding sternal scutes have a more equal antero-posterior extent than in
 those species. The impression commences at the median line, nearly an inch

 in advance of the transverse suture and three inches behind the second trans-
 verse scute, and describes a slight curve which is convex towards the anterior
 part of the plastron. The third scutal line commences from the middle of the
 median emargination, and instead of running parallel with the preceding line,

 as in the Tortoises and ordinary Emydes which I have examined, it inclines
 backwards as it passes outwards, and terminates at the middle of the posterior
 lateral emargination. The fifth scutal line is oblique, as in the Emydians
 generally, and here therefore runs parallel with the fourth line at a distance

of three inches and a half from it. The line bounding the lower part of the

marginal scutes, which in Tortoises is either parallel with or a little above the

suture uniting the lateral wall of the plastron with the marginal plates, here

intersects the marginal wall of the plastron at a distance of from two-thirds
of an inch to one inch and a half from that margin : impressions of four of

the marginal scutes may thus be traced upon this part of the sternum, a struc-
ture in which the present fossil differs most remarkably from all known ex-
isting Tortoises. This difference it is the more necessary to bear in mind,

since, in the antero-posterior extent as well as the transverse extent of the
lateral wall of the sternum, and in the form and extent of the emarginations

which bound the anterior and posterior pai't of this wall, the present fossil
exhibits a closer resemblance with the Land-tortoises than with the ordinary
Emydes. But the external surface of the plastron, instead of being slightly
concave, as in most tortoises, is slightly convex ; and where the plastron is
convex externally in existing tortoises, namely, at the outer margin of the

lateral wall, the fossil exhibits a slight concavity. In short, the character of

the surface is such as Avould lead one having in his mind the plastron of a
Tortoise as the ground of comparison, to suppose, at the first sight of the fossil,
that he was looking on the inner side of the plastron ; but the distinct and
well-marked impressions of the epidermal scutes proves that it is actually the
outer surface of the plastron which is here exposed. The anterior margin of
the plastron is truncated, as in most Platemydians.

   The osseous basis of the present plastron is half an inch in thickness ; the
structure of the bone is compact at the surface, including a coarsely spongy

diploe, as in the Chelonians generally.

   Portions of ribs of the Tretosternon pu7ictatum*, which from their specific
punctation and sculpturing of the outer surface have been referred to the
genus Trionyx, have been discovered by Dr. Mantell in the Wealden of Til-

   Amongst recent Emydians an approach to the Trionyces is made by the
subgenus Cryptopus {Emyda of Gray), inasmuch as the marginal plates, espe-

cially of the posterior free margin of the carapace, exist in a rudimental or
abortive state, as small granulated ossicles, suspended in the integument cover-
ing that border.

   The subgenus Chelydra manifests its affinity to Trionyx by another modi-

fication of its osseous structure, viz. the absence of the lateral osseous walls,

or alaj joining the plastron to the carapace, which are united only by flexible
cartilage, throughout life.

   No known existing species of Emydian has a free unossified central space

in the sternum in the full-grown state; but this is an immature character

common to all Chelonians, and is persistent in marine Turtles and Trionyces.

   In the present highly interesting extinct genus, Tretosternon, it would ap-
pear that the absence of marginal plates, and a cartilaginous union of the

plastron with the carapace, Avere associated likewise with a small vacuity in the

middle of the sternum of the mature animal. The evidently feebly-developed

scutes, and the sculpturing of the external surface of the flattened carapace,

complete the last step in the transition from the Elodite to the Potamite fami-

MM.lies of Chelonians in the system of   Dumeril and Bibron.

not enough of the skeleton of any individual has yet been obtained to afford

a foundation for a specific character.

  --Large Emydian from the Kimmej-idge Clay. In the museum of Sir P.

Grey Egerton is preserved the pubic bone of a large Emydian tortoise, ob-
tained from Heddington Pits. The bone measures 4^ inches in length, and
2 inches 10 lines in the breadth of the symphysial plate. As its specific de-
viations, particularly in regard to the length of the sternal process, from the
pubis of ordinary Emydians are well marked, it may probably belong to a

species of Platemys.

 --Footsteps of Emydians in New Red Sandsto7ie. Among the numerous

footsteps of Reptiles impressed upon the sandstone of Stourton Quarries,
Cheshire, those of an Emydian Tortoise of moderate size are not uncommon.

                            Genus Trionyx.

Certain British fossils from the secondary formations, referred to Trionyx,

have been proved to belong either to another family of Chelonians, or to a di-

Westinct class of animals.  learn from Dr. Buckland, that the supposed Tri-

onyx from the new red sandstone at Caithness (Caithness slate), has been pro-

nounced by M. Agassiz to be part of a fish : it is referable to the ganoid genus

Coccosteus.

I have as yet seen no Chelonite from the Wealden freshwater formations

that can be confidently affirmed to belong to Trionyx. The specimen de-

scribed and figured in the ' Illustrations of the Geology of Sussex,' 4to, p. 60,

pi. vi. fig. 8, is the dermal scute of the Crocodilian genus Goniopholis, as Dr.

Mantell himself has subsequently recognized : the other portions (pi. vi. figs.

1, 3, 5) belong, as already observed, to the Tretosternon punctatum, a species

which, like the Goniopholis, is common to the Wealden of Tilgate and the

--Purbeck limestone.
   Femur from lias at Linksjield. I have been favoured by Mr. Robertson

of Elgin, with the examination of a Chelonian femur, 4f inches in length,
from a stratum at Linksfield, in which remains of Plesiosaurus and Hybodus

occur ; and this femur, though not identical in form with that of any Trio-

nyx with which I could compare it, yet resembles the modifications of the bone

in that genus more closely than in Tortoises, Emydians or Turtles.

Although some of the turtles of the Eocene period, as the Chelone lotigi-

ceps, present such modifications of the jaws as seem to have adapted them to

habits and food analogous to those of the Trionyx, yet evidences of this

genus, to which the destruction of the eggs and young of Crocodiles is more

particularly assigned in the Nile and Ganges, are not wanting in certain lo-

calities where the London clay appears to have been deposited under circum-

stances analogous to those at the termination of equally gigantic rivers.

Unequivocal portions of a true Trionyx have been obtained from the

Eocene clay at Sheppey, and at Bracklesham : they are also associated, as in

the Paris basin, with remains of Anoplotherium and Palceotherium in the

Eocene lacustrine deposits of the quarries at Benstead in the Isle of Wight.

fossil remains, clearly referable to the marine genus Chelone, have hitherto

been found, is the Portland sandstone.
    Prof. Buckland possesses portions of the carapace and a beautiful specimen

of the skull of a Chelonian from the Portland sandstone, which, in the large

size of the orbits, the breadth but otherwise small size of the external nostril,

the extent of the osseous plate covering the temporal fossae, and formed prin-

cipally by the expanded posterior frontal and parietal bones, presents une-
quivocal characters of a marine species. It differs, however, from all other

known recent and most extinct Turtles, in having the cranium more depressed,

the nasal bones divided by a distinct transverse suture from the pre-frontals,

and by some otlier minor differences, in which an affinity to the Platemydian

family may be traced. The length of this cranium is 4? inches 4 lines, its

greatest breadth 4 inches. The chief modification of external form is the deep

emargination of the lower border of the cranium, between the malar and tym-

panic bones ; a character by which the present species approaches Emys and

Testudo. The Chelone longiceps of the Eocene tertiary formations makes a

similar but less marked approach  to  Emys                              and  the  present Turtle  also  re-
                                                                     ;

sembles Chel. longiceps* in the form of the mastoid bone, which, instead of

forming a thick convexity behind the wide tympanic cavity, forms a smooth

and slightly concave, moderately broad, semicircular plate of bone. The

muzzle is, however, as short in the Turtle of the Portland stone as in ordinary

species of Chelone ; the distance, for example, from the anterior part of the

orbit to the end of the muzzle, is only 11 lines. The median frontal sends a

narrow pointed process forwards between the pre-frontals, as far as the suture

which divides them from the nasal bones. The breadth of the interorbital

space is relatively less than in recent Turtles, or than in the Chelone longi-

ceps : it measures 8 lines.

The median frontal enters into the formation of the upper part of the or-

bit, in a greater proportion than in Chel. mydas : in the Chel. imbricata it is
excluded by the imion of the post-frontal and pre-frontal bones. The outer

surface of the skull is rather undulated, marked with fine strite and punctures,

but not rugous, as in Chel. breviceps\; the nasal bones are convex, and

impressed with larger pits. The upper boundary of the nasal aperture is

straight, the lateral ones curve to a point below : the breadth of this aperture

is 7 lines; that of the orbit is 13 lines.

The nasal process of the superior maxillary is characterised by a slightly

raised rough portion.

The lower jaw closely conforms to the ordinary Thalassian type ; the sym-

physis is convex, oblique, and as short as usual ; there is no approximation

to the peculiar condition of this part in the Harwich Turtle ( Chel. plani-

me?itu)nX).

The suture between the supra-angular and dentary piece does not make

so long and sharp an angle forwards, as in the Chelones mydas and Caretta ;
the coronoid process is rather higher, and the dentary piece sends out a ridge

which seems to have bounded the insertion of the temporal muscle below.

Thus the present cranium offers ample proof of its specific distinction from

that of any previously described Chelone ; and, while it has all the essential

characters of that marine genus, exhibits some points of resemblance to the

Emydians, as in the minor breadth of the interorbital space, the deep con-

cavity of the lower border of the skull behind the orbit, and in the form of

the mastoid bone. The separate nasal bone, which is the most interesting

  --Chelone obovata, nob. The most compli 3 and beau*'*"" I specimen of a

fossil turtle, from secondary strata, that I liav&'j <^ set  one from the

estuary limestone formation of the Isle of Purbeck, in 'ihe CTolTection of Chan-

ning Pearce, Esq. of Bradford, Wiltshire.

This species differs from the Chelone Benstedi of the chalk, from the Gla-

ris Turtle, and from all the well-determined Eocene species in the form of

the carapace, which, although obtusely pointed behind, begins to contract to

that extremity only at its posterior third part ; it gradually widens through

the two anterior thirds of its extent, and is broadest at the junction of the

fifth and sixth ribs ; the contour being obversely ovate, or with the broader

end turned downwards. This modification of form arises, not from the supe-

rior length of the fifth and sixth pairs of ribs, but f;'om the breadth of their

sternal appendages, called marginal plates. The internal surface of the cara-

pace is exposed to view, and is shallower than in any other Chelone ; resem-

bling in this character the Trionyx and Tretosternon ; the margins of the
carapace are slightly bent upwards, as in some Emydes.

The first vertebral plate is shorter antero-posteriorly, and less deeply emar-

ginate anteriorly than in the Maestricht Chelone f, and the first pair of ex-
jjanded ribs is narrower. This well-marked difference fortunately occurs in

the only parts in which a comparison could be established with the Tui'tles

from a stratum so nearly contemporaneous with the Purbeck beds. The first

rib is straight, and rather narrower in proportion than in the Eocene Turtles

in Chelone mydas this rib is the broadest of the series. It very gradually con-

tracts into its dentiform extremity, which on the left side appears to have been

separated by a narrow membranous space from the anterior marginal plates,

but not on the right side. The second rib is broader in proportion to the

first than in any other species of Chelone, recent or extinct ; more so even

than in the Trionyx, in which the first rib is narrower than the second. The

third and fourth ribs are the broadest.

   The rest gradually diminish in length and breadth. They are all as flat
upon the under surface as in Chelone mydas, presenting a great contrast to
the Harwich species, Chel. planimentum, in this respect.

   The median row of vertebral plates, after the first, are as narrow as in most
Chelones, and appear, as far as their form can be traced from an inside view,
to resemble those of the Chel. mydas and Chel. longiceps, but to have been
narrower than in the extinct Eocene Turtles : the length of the fourth ver-

tebral plate in the Chel. obovata, for example, is 1 inch 3 lines, its greatest

breadth is 6 lines. The eleventh six-sided plate, which resembles a triangle,
with truncated angles, and is wedged between the last pair of ribs, is here
divided by a transverse suture into two nearly equal parts. The twelfth plate

is nearly twice as broad as long, and has convex lateral margins : the thir-

teenth vertebral plate, or the last of the marginal plates, is relatively broader

than in existing turtles, and has its posterior margin more feebly emargi-

nate. The marginal p! tes differ in the superior expanse of those attached to

the fifth, sixth and sevt.ith ribs. That to which the eighth rib is attached

corresponds with +.he tenth in th" Chel. mydas, and the eleventh projects in

an angular form  Jie i '-^rspace between the dentiform extremity of the

eighth rib and thi. n. elfti. t^ertebral plate. The thirteenth marginal plate sends

a similar process between the seventh and eighth ribs : the exterior margins

of all the marginal plates are straight, and the carapace is bounded by an

unbroken contour. The diameter of the marginal plate attached to the fifth

rib, parallel with the axis of the carapace, is 1 inch 6 lines ; the diameter

transverse to the carapace is 6 lines :

A considerable proportion of the plastron of the same individual is pre-

served, together with part of the bones of the hinder extremities, and both afford

essential characters of the genus Chelone. The plastron of the Chelone obo-

vata resembles that of the Eocene Turtles in the greater extent of ossification,

and especially in the greater breadth of the xiphisternals, as compared with the
recent species ; but it differs from all other known species of Chelone in the

greater depth of the notches at the anterior part of the hyosternals and at

the posterior part of the hyposternals, which notches correspond with those

that in the more fully ossified plastrons of Emijdes give passage to the four
locomotive extremities. The essential condition, however, of the plastron

of the marine turtles is preserved, first, in the defective ossification of the

lateral margins of the plastron between the hyo- and hyposternals, which are

not co-extended and united to form a lateral wall of support to the carapace,

as in the Emydes ; and, secondly, in the form, and union by gomphosis, of the
xiphisternals with the hyposternals : what proportion of the central part of

the plastron continued unossified, the condition of the specimen does not allow

of determining. There is evidence of the concavity of the sternum along

the middle of the under surface, as in most Chelones.

The hyosternal is chiefly remarkable for the sudden expansion of the ex-

ternal radiated process, which occasions a notch at its posterior part, at the

lateral unossified interspace between the hyo- and hyposternal bones, almost

as deep as that which is anterior to the radiated process. The hyposternal
bone presents likewise a similar modification of form. By this peculiarity of
form the present species might be known by a single detached hyosternal or
hyposternal bone. The tooth-like process of the hyosternal, which is im-

planted in the xiphisternal, is received into a notch, the inner boundary of

which is much deeper than the outer.
   The breadth of both the' xiphisternals, taken across the termination of this

notch, is 3 inches : they are separated by an angular fissure for the extent of
an inch at their posterior interspace, but their median dentated margins meet

in the rest of their extent, which is about one inch and a half.

    Tlie breadth of sternum, across the hyposternal bones, is 8 inches ; the least

antero-posterior extent of the conjoined hyo- and hyposternals is 4^ inches.
   In this admeasurement, as compared with the transverse extent o? the same

bones, the Chelone ohovata differs in a marked degree from the Chel. lougiceps
of Slieppey, and indeed approaches nearer to the existing species of Chelone
than do the Eocene Turtles. The adherence to the thalassian type is like-

wise well exhibited in the present fossil by the forms and proportions of the

principal bones of the hind-extremities or paddles, which are much shorter as

compared with the fore-paddles and the body generally, in the marine than in
any of the freshwater or land Chelonia. The length of the femur is 1 inch
9 lines ; that of the tibia 1 inch 7 lines. The articular extremities are too
imperfect to allow of a comparison of the forms of these bones with the cor-

responding ones of existing species.
    Since the carapace of the Chelone obovata approaches, in those modifications

by which it differs from other turtles, to the Emydian type, it is not impro-
bable that the skull of the Chelonian, above described, from the contiguous
subjacent stratum of Portland stone, which offers analogous approximations

--to the Emydian group, may belong to the same species.
    fVealden Chelone, sp. indeterm. Portions of the carapace and plastron,
and bones of the extremities of a large species of marine turtle, some of
them indicating individuals with a carapace nearly three feet in length, have
been discovered by Dr. Mantell in the Wealden strata of Tilgate Forest, and
are figured in his valuable ' Illustrations of the Geology of Sussex.'

   No specific characters are deduced from these fossils, and the nature of the

specimens seems not to have allowed the approximation to be carried closer

than to the marine genus Chelone. With regard to one of the specimens,
(pi. vi. fig. 2.) however, Mr. Clift's authority is quoted for its resemblance
with the corresponding part of Chelone itnbricata, and Dr. Mantell acknow-
ledges that " as Cuvier had referred the turtles of Melsbroeck to the Emydes,
we at first entertained doubts whether our appropriation of this specimen to
the Chelonice were correct. Mr. Clift's remark, however, tends to confirm the

opinion that it belongs to a marine turtle," loc. cit., p. 62.
   After a careful comparison of the specimens in the Mantellian Collection* in

the British Museum, I have come to the conclusion that the Wealden species
differs from Chelone imbricata, Ch. carmata, and other known species in as
great a degree as do many of the other extinct Chelones, in regard to the
greater extent of the ossification of the costal interspaces and of the sternum.

    In the convexity of the under side of the vertebral ribs ; and in the modi-
fications of the form of the episternal, hyosternal and hyposternal bones the
Wealden species offers the nearest resemblance to the Chelone planimentum
of the Harwich Eocene clay. It is to be regretted that this relationship can-
not be more decisively tested by a comparison of the skulls, and especially of
the lower jaw of the two species : l)ut these parts of the skeleton appear not to

marked off by a suture from the anterior frontals, but in a different manner
from that in the skull of the Portland turtle. The characters of the genus
Chelone are clearly expressed by the extensive roof of bone overarching the
temporal fossae, and by as large a proportion of this roof being formed by the
post-frontals as in existing Chelones. The orbits are also large, and their

superior interspace is broad.

   The median frontals form a small proportion of the upper border of the or-

bits ; the anterior extremities of the median frontals, instead of converging to
a point, are extended forwards, between the anterior frontals, in a broader
proportion than in the Portland Turtle, and are obliquely truncated : it is only

in the genus Chelys among existing Chelonians, that the anterior frontals are

thus separated from each other ; but in the Chelys the intervening extremities
of the median frontals are continued to the upper border of the external
nostril. In the present fossil cranium the oblique extremities of the anterior
frontals are arrested at the distance of four lines from the nasal aperture, which
is bounded above by two distinct nasal bones ; these bones are joined by su-
ture to the median frontals, to the anterior frontals, and to the superior max-
illaries ; the nasal processes of which extend upward, and exclude the anterior

frontals from the nasal boundary. The superior maxillaries are traversed
obliquely by a large and deep scutal impression, above which the superior
maxillary forms a convex prominence at the anterior part of the orbit. The
scutal groove which traverses the median frontals is as strongly marked ; that
which impresses the post-frontals is fainter. The expanded trumpet-shaped
portion of the tympanic bone comes nearer the upper margin of the cavity

than in existing Chelones.

   The palatal bones have no true palatal process. The palatal processes of

the intermaxillary and maxillary bones form an unusually prominent angular
ridge, running nearly parallel with the trenchant margin of the jaw : the bony

palate is not extended along the middle line beyond the intermaxillaries. The
pterygoid bones present moderately wide and deep external emarginations.

   Although very characteristic remains of Chelonian reptiles have been de-
termined by Cuvier, from the cretaceous beds of St. Peter's Mount, near
Maestricht, no evidence of the present order of Reptiles in British chalk

formations had been made public until my description of a Chelonite from
the lower chalk at Burham, Kent, in the museum of Sir P. Egerton, appeared

in the Proceedings of the Geological Society. This Chelonite consisted of
four marginal plates of the carapace, and a few other obscure fragments,
sufficient to prove that the species was not Trionyx or Testudo : and as they
differed in form from those of the recent species of Chelone, with which I

compared them, and resembled rather the posterior marginal plates of some
Emydians, I stated that this correspondence " rendered it probable that these
remains are referable to that family of Chelonia which lives in fresh water or

estuaries." Subsequent observation of the various interesting modifications
by which extinct Chelones diminish, as it were, the gap between the marine
and freshwater genera as they remain at the present day, has weakened the
impression which the character of the marginal plates of the chalk Chelo-

nite first made in favour of its Emydian affinities ; and the examination of the
beautiful Chelonite, obtained from the same quarries at Burham, and relieved
from the chalk matrix by Mr. Bensted, lately described and figured by Dr.

Mantell in the Philosophical Transactions, has demonstrated that it is not an

Emys but a true Chelone.
--174 REPORT 1841.

The fossil in question consists of nearly the whole carapace, and a con-

siderable portion of the plastron, with a coracoid bone.

    The carapace includes all the dorsal or vertebral plates, save the first; the
usual number of expanded ribs, viz. eight pairs ; and the entire border of
marginal plates, save the three first. In the sternum the hyosternal and hy-
posternal bones may be distinguished. The general form of the carapace is
elliptical, terminated by a point at the narrower posterior end, Avhich, how-

ever, is less contracted than in other Chelones. It is as depressed as in Che-

lones generally. To judge from the unniutilated vertebral plates, which are

the four last, the carapace appears to have been traversed by a median longi-
tudinal crest, from which the sides gently slope with a slight convex curva-
ture, as in Chelone mydas.

   The more immediate indications of the close affinity of the fossil to the

marine turtles are given by the incomplete ossification and anchylosis of the
ribs and sternal bones, the latter being in consequence dislocated from each
other ; and more especially by the shape and size of the marginal plates at-
tached to the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ribS; as also by the form and

length of the coracoid bone.

The vertebral plates are  as narrow relatively as  in  the  ordinary  Chelones
                                                                                                                  ;

but their precise form can only be distinguished in the three last. The ninth*,

or that to which the eighth rib is in part articulated, is 3 lines in length and

2 in breadth ; the tenth expands posteriorly into a triangular form ; both

these have their middle part raised into a ridge ; the eleventh plate is sud-

denly expanded, with angular sides, which slope away from a median longi-

tudinal ridge : this is crossed by a transverse ridge just anterior to the junc-

tion of the plate with the median terminal plate of the marginal series, which

is convex above and traversed by a median longitudinal furrow. The margins

of this plate meet posteriorly at an open angle. The second to the seventh

pairs of expanded ribs are joined together only along their vertebral halves.

The length of the expanded part of the third rib is 9 lines ; its narrow,

tooth-like part, before it reaches the marginal plate, is also 9 lines ; about 3

lines of its extremity is inserted into the deep groove of the concave surface

of the marginal plate. The width of the interspace between the narrow parts

of the third and fourth ribs is 4 lines ; the length of the expanded part of the
first rib is IO5 lines; the breadth of the expanded part of the first rib is 8

lines ; the length of the narrow end of the rib, clear of the marginal plate,

is 3 lines. In the superior bi'eadth of the first rib the Chelone Bensledi agrees

with existing turtles, and differs strikingly from the Purbeck species. The

last short rib sends, almost directly backwards, a short, narrow, tooth-like

process, at right angles to the anterior margin of its sub-triangular expanded

part. In Chelone obovata it is extended more nearly parallel with the ex-

panded part.

The marginal plates have the same general uniformity of size which we

observe in the existing Chelones ; the posterior ones are not expanded as in

the Purbeck Chelone, and in certain Emydes, as Emys serrata. See. ; but the

most decisive evidence against the Emydian affinities of the present fossil is

afforded by the form and development of the inferior borders of the marginal

plates attached to the fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs; for these plates, instead of

being expanded and extended inwards to join the hyo- and hyposternals, and to

combine with these elements of the plastron in forming the lateral supporting

wall of the carapace, are not so much developed in breadth as the same parts of

the posterior marginal plates, but form with them an even free border, as in other

Chelones; in which not any of the marginal plates are joined with the sternum.

ON BRITISH FOSSIL REPTILES.  175

   With reference to the general imperfect ossification of the carapace, the
deductions in favour of the marine nature of the Chalk Chelonite might be
invalidated by the hypothesis that it was the young of some very large spe-

cies of Emys ; but the existing Emydians, at the immature period when they

exhibit the incomplete ossification of the carapace and plastron, have the
marginal plates opposite the lateral processes of the hyosternals and hypo-
sternals joined with those processes by an inward development of their in-
ferior border, which is suddenly and considerably broader than the inferior

border of the contiguous free marginal plates. The outer contour of the
ninth, tenth, and eleventh plates projects in the form of a slight angle, and
thus differs from the same parts of Chelone mydas and Chelone obovata ; the
others have a straight free margin. The marginal plates appear as if bent
upon themselves to form their outer margin, at a rather acute angle, receiving

the extremities of the rib in a depression excavated in the concavity of the
angle ; they are nearly twice as long in the direction parallel with the margin
of the carapace than transverse to it, and are traversed in the latter direction
along the middle of their upper surface with the groove or impression of the

marginal scutes. The free edge of the upjier plate of the marginal pieces is
slightly notched above the insertion of the rib, and they correspond with
those of the Chelonite from the Burham chalk-pit in the collection of Sir
P. Egerton. The form of the median or vertebral scutes is only to be traced

at the anterior part of the carapace, but their relative breadth and the out-
ward extension of their lateral angles correspond, like the characters of the

more enduring parts, with the type of structure of the marine turtles. The

breadth of the first vertebral scute is 1 inch 8 lines, that of the second scute

is 2 inches.
    The coracoid bone varies in form so as to be very characteristic of the dif-

ferent genera of Chelonians ; it is a triangular plate in Testudo, a more elon-
gated triangle in Chelys, a broad bent elongated plate in Trionyx, a narrower
bent plate in Emys, a long, straight, slender bone, slightly expanded and
flattened at the sternal end, in Chelone : now it is precisely the latter form

that this bone, fortunately preserved in the present specimen, here exhibits,
showing that the same modifications of the skeleton are combined in the past

as in the present species of Chelone ; it is 1 inch 7 lines in length, cylindrical

at its humeral half, and gently expanded to a breadth of 3 lines at its sternal

end. The proportion which this bone presents of one-fourth the length of
the carapace is only paralleled in the existing Chelones ; it is much shorter

in the Emydes.

    The hyosternal and hyposternal bones resemble rather those of the turtles
than of the young Emydes ; certainly no Emys, with a carapace 5 inches in

 length, presents such forms as these bones exhibit in the present fossil;

several rays or pointed spines of bone are developed from the anterior half of

 the median margin of the hyosternal piece, as in Chelone caretta ; the rest of

 the margin contributes to form the circumference of the large central aper-

 ture of the sternum. The hyposternal sends similar rays from the posterior
 half of its outer margin, leaving the anterior half to join, probably the same

 proportion of the outer margin of the hyosternal, so as to form a deep lateral

 angular notch of the sternum. The length of the hyposternal is 1 inch

 2 lines. The epi-, ento- and xiphisternal bones ai-e not preserved.
    From the preceding description it must be obvious, as has been already

 observed, that the present Chelonite of the chalk can only be supposed to

 belong to the genus Emys, on the supposition that it is a very young spe-

 cimen of some unusually large species : but against this supposition, the

the marginal plates, tlie non-development of the lower margin of any of these

plates for a junction Avith the plastron, the narrow elongate form of the ver-

tebral plates, and the broad vertebral scutes, collectively and separately mili-

tate ; whilst in all these modifications the Turtle from the Chalk so closely

corresponds with the true Chelones, that I cannot hesitate to refer it to the

marine family of the order.  ,

From the breadth of the xiphisternals in the remains of this species first

described by me, I was induced to suppose that a new subgenus ( Cimochelys)
of marine Turtles was thereby indicated, having a closer affinity to the Emydes

than the typical species ; and the same affinity seems to be shown by the

more regular elliptical form of the carapace of Mr. Bensted's beautiful spe-

cimen. The structure of the cranium, when this desirable part of the skeleton
is discovered, may confirm the propriety of the subgeneric distinction ; but

the numerous decided marks of closer affinity to Clielone leave no alternative

than to regard the fossil species of the chalk as a member of that genus.

It difi'ers from all known species, especially the sub-carinated species of

Sheppey, in the form of the carapace, which is more truly elliptical than in

any other species with which I am acquainted.

I have been favoured with. the opportunity of inspecting portions of the

skeleton of a large Chelonian obtained by Mrs. Smith, of Tonbridge Wells,

from the lower chalk at Burham, Kent, and skilfully relieved from iheir

mineral bed by that lady. The principal bones consist of two series, one

containing five, the other four, of the marginal plates of the carapace, in

natural connection, and from that part of the margin where they receive the

extremities of the vertebral ribs. These marginal plates in Chelone mydas

are three-sided, and have two terminal surfaces by which they are united,

suturally, to one another : of the three free surfaces, the one, directed towards

the interior of the body, is characterized by a deep depression for the recep-

tion of the tooth-like extremity of the rib ; the two otlaer (upper and under)
surfaces meet at an angle, which is produced at certain parts to form the

marginal dentations of the lateral and posterior parts of the carapace in that

species of turtle, but is more open and obtuse in the marginal plates at

the anterior part of the carapace. In the fossil the marginal plates have the

general characters of those of the genus Clielone, but differ from those of the

Chelone mydas, in being more concave on the central or perforated side, and

they are also concave at the upper side, and in a slighter degree at the under

side ; these sides likewise meet at a more acute angle, and this angle is pro-

duced into a sharper and more continuous ridge : but this ridge subsides at

one end of the series of five plates, and the upper and under sides gradually

meet at a more open angle, which is rounded off in the first of the series.

This plate, therefore, answers to the third marginal plate in the Chelone

mydas, or that which receives the end of the first expanded vertebral rib

and the remainder, therefore, to the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh marginal

plates : now these are precisely the marginal plates in the Ernys, which have

their inferior margins developed inwards and articulated by suture to the

lateral wall of the carapace : but these margins not being so developed or

terminated in the present fossil, but, on the contrary, being inferior to the

upper margin in breadth*, and terminating like that margin in a blunted

edge, prove the present Chelonite to belong, like the smaller Chelonite from

the same chalk-pit already described, to the marine genus Chelone.

The following admeasurements will show the different proportions of the

to the pit, is broader than the lower one, in these plates of the Chelone mydas ; but the dif-
ference is less than in the present fossil species.

than they are long ; the xiphisternals are unusually broad. The tooth-like
processes from the mesial margins of the hyo- and hyposternals are more
numerous and smaller than in existing species, and interlock with each other,
so that two margins of each of these bones are joined by suture, instead of
one, as in almost all other turtles. Yet in the largest specimens of this species
which I have seen, the centre of the sternum remains unossified, its sides un-
united by bone with the. carapace, and the external and part of the internal

margins of its constituent bones preserve their separated tooth-like rays.

   The small specimen of which the plastron is figured by Parkinson and by
Cuvier, belongs to the present species of Chelone ; it is now preserved in the
rich collection of Prof. Bell. In the same collection there is preserved a
specimen of Chelone longiceps, the plastron of which is 8 inches in length
and nearly 8 inches in breadth ; in this specimen, which is the largest of the

present species that I have seen, the central vacuity of the plastron and the

toothed margins of many of the constituent bones remain. Three of the Che-
lonites in the museum of Sir P. Egerton, two in that of Mr. Bowerbank, one

in that of Mr. Dixon, and one in the Hunterian Collection, belong to the

--Chelone longiceps. All these specimens are from the Isle of Sheppey.
   Chelone planimenttim, nob. The species which, in the number of indi-

viduals representing it comes next in order after the Chelone longiceps, is
characterized by a flat and unusually long symphysis of the lower jaw, but
this is associated with a broad, high, and convex cranium, and with a muzzle
not longer than in ordinary Chelones. The carapace is characterized by the

strength of the ribs which traverse the whole of the under part of the ex-

panded plates in the form of thick convex ridges.

All the specimens of this species that I have hitherto seen are from the

AEocene clay of the eastern coast of Essex.  carapace in the British Mu-

seum measures 13 inches in length and 12 inches across the fourth pair of

Aexpanded ribs.  skull in the museum of Prof. Sedgwick, associated with a

carapace and other parts of the skeleton of the same individual, and another

skull in that of Prof. Bell, indicate that the head was relatiA'ely as large in

--the Chelone planimentum as in the Chelone imhricata.
    Chelone breviceps, nob. This species, in the narrow, ovate, and posteriorly

pointed carapace, and in the less extensive ossification of the sternum, re-

sembles more the recent Chelones than does the Chelone longiceps. Its cra-

nium also preserves the ordinary form in its depth and in the shortness of its

muzzle. The external surface of the cranium and osseous buckler is rugous.

The angles by which the expanded ribs are wedged into the interspaces of the

vertebral plates have equal or nearly equal sides. It appears to have exceeded

the Chelone longiceps in size : a portion of the osseous buckler of a Chelone      i

breviceps, with a carapace 16 inches in length, is preserved in the museum of

Mr. Robertson, surgeon, at Chatham.

Smaller specimens of the Chelone breviceps, all from the Isle of Sheppey

are preserved in the Hunterian Collection, in the museum of Prof. Bell, and

in that of Mr. Bowerbank. Mr. Bowerbank's specimen exhibits the head in

connection with the carapace and plastron, and is the most beautiful Chelo-

nite, perhaps, that has yet been obtained from any formation.

Chelone convexa, nob The surface of the bony buckler of this species,

like that of the Chelone longiceps, is smooth, but the forms of the constituent

bones of the carapace and their degree of ossification differ considerably from

those of a Chelone longiceps of the same size, and resemble those of Chelone

mydas. The carapace is more convex than in the preceding species from

Sheppey, and than in the existing Chelones, whence the specific name of the

present extinct species. It is from the Isle of Sheppey.

--Chelone suheristata, nob. This species, also from the Isle of Sheppey, has

the usual thalassian form of carapace, which is narrow, ovate, and contracted

to a point behind, with a sternum resembling also existing Chelones, in the

form and degree of ossification of its constituent pieces, and the slenderness

of the xiphisternals. It may be distinguished from the Chelone breviceps by

the smoothness of its carapace, the different form of the vertebral plates, and

the development of a sharp ridge on the sixth and eighth vertebral plates.

   The sole example of this species which has come under my observation is

the osseous buckler, 9 inches in length and 6^ inches in breadth, in the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 '

museum of Mr. Bowerbank.

  --Chelone latiscu^ta, nob. This species is founded on a nearly complete

buckler of a turtle from Sheppey, measuring 3 inches in length, from the

second to the seventh plate inclusive : it may be a variety, or the immature

state of Chelone longiceps, but I have not yet had the opportunity of ascer-

taining to what extent the relative breadth of the vertebral scutes varies in

individuals of different age of existing species of turtle. In the present case

the vertebral scutes are nearly twice as broad in proportion to their length,

as they are in the Clielone longiceps, or in any of the other well-marked spe-

cies of Eocene turtles.

The indications of Chelonites from Eocene strata, in the works of Parkin-

son, Woodward and Konig, being unaccompanied by the anatomical deduc-

tions essential to the establishment of their true affinities, have been either

misinterpreted or neglected ; and except the citation of Woodward's Chelone
Harvicensis, in M. H. v. Meyer's Compilation*, the existence in the London

clay of fossil Emydes alone has been recognized in the latest summaries of

the present branch of Paleontology f. These, therefore, could indicate but
little difference between the present fauna and that of the Eocene period in

regard to the Chelonian order. But the case assumes a very different aspect
when we arrive at the conviction that the majority of Sheppey Chelonites be-

long to the marine genus Chelone, and reflect that the number of extinct

Eocene turtles from that limited locality very nearly equals that of all the

well-determined species of Chelone now known to exist. For notwithstand-

ing the assiduous search of the naturalist-collector, and the attractions which

the shell and flesh of turtles offer to the commercial voyager, the tropical

seas, though so often traversed, have not as yet yielded more than five good

species of  Chelone                                   and  of these  only  two, as  Chelone  mydas and  Chelone
                                                   ;

caretta, are known to frequent the same locality. Now, whilst it is obvious

that but a small proportion of the organized treasures of the vast deposit of

petrified mud and clay which fills the London Basin have been brought to

light, the results of the examination of fossil Chelonites evidently show that

the ancient ocean of the Eocene epoch was more abundantly provided with

turtles, and that these presented a greater variety of specific modifications

than the same extent of ocean in any of the warmer parts of the earth at the

present day.

The indications which the Sheppey turtles give, in conjunction with the

other organic remams from the same depository, of the higher temperature

that prevailed in the latitude in which they lived, cannot be overlooked yet
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

at the same time the conditions, which allow of the attainment of the size
which tlie present tropical turtles often exhibit, would seem not to have been

present in the time and place of existence of the extinct species of Chelone

In the Appendix to the second 4to edition of the ' Ossemens Fossiles,' Cu-

vier remarks, " Les os de serpens sent encore phis rares, s'il est possible. Je

n'en ai vu que des vertebres des breches osseuses de Cette, dont j'ai parle tl

Tarticle de ces breches, et une seule des terrains d'eau douce de I'ile de Shep-

pey*."

The'Ophidiolites from this formation have been the subject of a memoir

by me, pubUshed in the sixth volume (second series) of the Geological Trans-

actions, in which the best-preserved specimens in the collections of John

Hunter and Mr. Bowerbank are described. The Hunterian Ophidiolites

were referred by the Founder of the collection, in the original MS. Cata-

logue, to the Crocodile ; some of those in the private collections I found

ticketed ·' Vertebrae of Tortoise." All these specimens presented the general

characteristics of the vertebrae of serpents, and resembled in structure as well

as size those of the Constrictors (Python and Boa^ more than those of the

colubrine or poisonous families. Very recognizable differences are to be dis-

cerned in the Eocene fossil vertebrae as compared with the vertebrae of exist-

ing Pythons and Boae ; they are longer as compared with their height or

breadth ; the costal tubercle is placed lower down ; the transverse process

supporting the lower anterior articular process has a greater vertical extent^

and the ridge continued from the lower anterior to the lower posterior oblique

process is less developed ; the oblique processes do not extend so far outwards,
and the spinous process is higher, but has a less antero-posterior extent than

in existing land-serpents. The middle of the posterior margin of the neura-

pophysis, opposite the external angle of the articular excavation or mortise,

is produced backwards in the form of an angular plate. The inferior surface

of the vertebra is not longitudinally carinated, as in some Coluhri, but has a

tubercle at the middle of the anterior part, as in the Python.

These differences justify the consideration of the Sheppey Ophidiolite as

the representative of a distinct genus as well as species, for which I have pro-

posed the name of Palceophis toliapiciis.

The largest of the Ophidiolites in Mr. Bowerbank's collection exhibits a

portion of the vertebral column suddenly bent upon itself, including about

thirty vertebrte, and indicating the usual lateral flexibility of the spine. The

Hunterian specimen also consists of a group of as many vertebras more dis-

jointed, and cemented, with a number of long and slender ribs, irregularly

together by a mass of indurated clay. In the museum of Mr. SauU a few

vertebrae, and a fragment of the skull of the same Palaoplds, likewise from

Sheppey, are preserved. The size of the vertebrae in the foregoing speci-

mens corresponds with that of the vertebrae of a boa constrictor of 10 or

12 feet in length.

Vertebrae of a serpent agreeing in character with those of the London

clay at Sheppey, but smaller, have been obtained by Mr. Colchester, from

the sand of the Eocene formation underlying the Red Crag at Kyson or

Kingston in Suffolk. These have also the small tubercle at the under and

back part of the body of the vertebra, instead of the ridge, as in Coluber and

Naja                       and thus, like the larger vertebrae from                     Sheppey, they come nearer to

single ; in Naja it is almost divided into two, the upper being convex, the
lower moiety concave ; in the Python the upper half of the tubercle is con-
vex and the lower half concave, but the two facets are not marked oft". In the
Palccoplds, of both Sheppey and Kyson, it is simply convex.

   The most perfectly preserved, as well as the largest specimens of vertebrae
of Palceophis which I have seen, are from the Eocene clay at Bracklesham,

and are preserved in the select collection of Fr. Dixon, Esq. of Worthing.

The serpent to which the largest of these vertebrae belonged must have been
upwards of 20 feet in length.

    Ophidian reptiles, of ten, twelve, and twenty feet in length, exist in the
jiresent day only in intertropical regions, and they for the most part prey on

mammals and birds. If, therefore, direct evidence of species of both these
warm-blooded classes in the London clay had not been obtained*, they might

have been strongly suspected to have co-existed with serpents of such dimen-
sions as those to which the vertebrae and ribs above mentioned belonged.

                              Order BATRACHIA.

   Of this order of Reptiles, represented in the present Fauna of Great

Britain by a few diminutive species of frogs, toads, and newts, the remains

of some remarkable extinct members have been discovered in the New Red

SandstQue of Warwickshire.

   As the determination of these fragments has been the result of the exami-
nation, in part microscopical, of detached bones and fragments of bone and

teeth, and since the Batrachian order, like most others at the confines of a
great natural group, exhibits wide modifications of its typical structure, a ievi

words may be expected touching the grounds for referring the fossils in

question to the Batrachian order, especially since similar fossils in another
country, specimens of the same species, have been regarded as parts of

Saurians.

   The Batrachians have no fixed type of external form like the higher orders
of Reptiles, but some, as the broad and flat-bodied toads and frogs, most

resemble the Chelonians, especially the soft-skinned mud-tortoises ( Trionyx) ;
other Batrachians, as the CcEcilia', resemble Ophidians ; a third group, as the

Newts and Salamanders, represent the Lacertians ; and among the Perenni-
branchiate reptiles there are species which combine with external gills the

mutilated condition of the apodal fishes.

   Thus it will be perceived, that, even if the entire skeleton of one of the

New Red Sandstone Batrachians had been obtained, there is no fixed or cha-

racteristic general outward ibrm in the Batrachian order whereby its affinity

to that group could have been determined. The common characters by which

the Batrachians, so diversified in other respects, are naturally associated into
one group or suborder of reptiles, besides being taken from the condition of

the circulating and generative systems and other perishable parts, are, how-
ever, fortunately as strongly manifested in modifications of th« skeleton and
principally in the skull. This is joined to the atlas by the medium of two tu-
bercles, developed exclusively from the lateral occipitals ; the bony palate is
formed chiefly by two broad and flat bones, called ' vomerine' by Cuvier, and
generally supj)orting teeth. It is only in the Batrachians among reptiles that
examples are found of two or more rows of teeth on the same bone, espe-
cially on the lower jaw (Cacilia;, Sireties). With regard to vertebral cha-
racters, no such absolute Batrachian modifications can be adduced as those
above cited from the anatomy of the cranium. Some Batrachians, as is well
known, have the vertebra; united by ball-and-socket joints, as in most recent

                       * Geological Transactions, second series, vol. vi. p. 203, pi. 21.
--182 REPORT 1841.

reptiles; others by biconcave joints, as in a few recent and most extinct

Saurians. Some species have ribs, others want those appendages ; the pos-

session of ribs, therefore, even if longer than those of the CcBcilicB, by a
fossil reptile combining all the essential Batrachian characters of the skull,
would not be sufficient ground for pronouncing such reptile to be a Saurian.

Much less could its Saurian nature be pronounced from the circumstance of

its possessing large conical striated teeth ; as the ordinary characters of size,

form, number, and even presence or absence of teeth, varies much in existing

Batrachians, the location of teeth on the vomerine bones being the only con-
stant dental character in which they differ from all other orders of reptiles.

   My first acquaintance with the remarkable fossils under consideration was

founded on the examination of portions of teeth, from the new red sandstone
of Coton End quarry, Warwickshire, transmitted to me by Dr. Lloyd of Lea-
mington. The external characters of these teeth corresponded with those
which had previously been discovered, by Prof. Jaeger, in the German Keuper
formation in Wirtemberg, and on which the genus Mastodonsaurus had been

 found.

    The results of a microscopic examination of the teeth of the Mastodon-

saurus from the German Keuper, and of those from the New Red Sandstone

 of Warwickshire, have been detailed in the Proceedings of the Geological

--Society, January 1841, and illustrated in my ' Odontography,' pp. 195 217,

pis. 63, 63 A, 63 B, 64, 64 a, 64 b. They proved that the teeth from both
localities possessed in common a very remarkable and complicated structure,
 to the principle of which, viz. the convergence of numerous inflected folds of
 the external layer of cement towards the pulp-cavity, a very slight approach
 was made in the fang of the tooth of the Ichthyosaurus, and that a closer ap-
 proximation to the labyrinthine structure in question was made by the teeth of
 several species of fishes, while the teeth of existing Batrachians were simple,

 like those of most Saurians.

     Thus, inasmuch as the extinct animal in question manifested in the intimate
 structure of its teeth an affinity to fishes, it might be expected that, if it actu-
 ally belonged to the class of reptiles, the rest of its structure would manifest
 the characters of the lowest order, viz. the Batrachia, the existing members of

 which pass, though not by the dental character alluded to, yet by so many

 other remarkable degradations of structure, towards fishes. Now it has actu-

 ally happened that, in the same formation in Wirtemberg from which the la-
 byrinthic teeth of the so-called Mastodonsaurus have been derived, a frag-
 ment of the posterior portion of the skull has been obtained, showing the
 apparent absence of the basi-occipital, and the development of a separate
 condyle on each ex -occipital bone; whence Prof. Jaeger, recognizing the
 identity of this structure with the Batrachian character above mentioned,
 founded upon the fossil a new genus of Batrachia, which he called ' Sala-
 mandroides giganteus.' Subsequent discoveries, however, satisfied the Pro-
 fessor that the bi-condylous fragment of skull, representing the genus Sala-
 mandroides, belonged to the same reptile as the teeth, on which he had founded

 the genus Mastodonsaurus. But notwithstanding the evidence thus olitained
  of the Batrachian affinities of the Keuper Reptile, Prof. Jaeger preferred to
 retain for it the name which implied its membership with the Saurian order,

  and cancelled the genus Salamandroides, Avhich form of substantive has, in-
  deed, been forbidden by the canons of botanical nomenclature to be used as
 the name of a genus*.

     I proceed now briefly to notice the fossils from the Warwick sandstone

described in my Memoir read before the Geological Society, and in which

additional, and, as it seems to me, conclusive proof is given of the Batrachian
nature of the genus to which those fossils belong ; with the establishment of
five distinct species, one of which is most probably identical with the Masto-
donsaurus salamandroides of Prof. Jaeger.

   It is scarcely necessary to repeat the reasons which I have given to show
that the generic denomination Mastodonsaurus cannot be retained ; first, it
unavoidably recalls the idea of the mammalian genus Mastodon, or else a
mammilloid form of tooth, whereas, all the teeth of the reptile so called are
originally, and most of them are permanently of a cuspidate and not of a
mammilloid form ; secondly, because the second element of the word, saurus,
indicates the genus to belong to the Saurian and not to the Batrachian order
of reptiles. For these reasons I have proposed to designate the genus in
question Labyrinthodon, in allusion to the peculiar and characteristic struc-

ture of the teeth.

   The specimens which I have examined are referable to five species, viz.
\. Lahyrinthodon salamandroides; 2. L. leptognathus ; 3. L. pachygnathus
4. L. ventricosus ; and 5. L. scutulatus : and I shall here briefly notice the
characters exhibited by the bones assignable to the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th species.

  --Lahyrinthodon leptognathus. The remains which I consider as portions of

this species, consist of fragments of the upper and lower jaws, two vertebrae,
and a sternum. They were found in tlie sandstone quarries at Coton End,
near Warwick.

   The portions of the upper jaw show that the maxillary or facial division of
the skull was broad, much depressed, and flattened, resembling the skull of
the gigantic Salamander and of the Alligator ; and the outer surface of the
bones was strongly sculptured, as in the Crocodilian family, but of a relatively
larger and coarser pattern. One portion of the upper jaw contains the an-
terior moiety of the single row of small teeth, or thirty sockets, and the base
of one of the great anterior tusks. The bases of the serial teeth project

directly from the outer wall of the shallow socket, there being no alveolar

ridge external to it. The large anterior fang is three times the size of the
first of the serial teeth, and the size of these gradually diminishes as they are
placed further back ; the length of the common-sized teeth being about two
lines, and the greatest breadth one-third of a line. The apical two-thirds of

each tooth is smooth, but the basal third is fluted, and anchylosed to the outer

wall of the socket. The breadtli of the upper jaw, opposite the middle of the
dental series, was two inches six lines ; in proceeding backwards the jaw gra-
dually expands to three inches, and in proceeding forwards narrows, but in a
less degree towards the anterior extremity, and then slightly widens or in-
clines outwards on account of the large tusks. Where the upper jaw is entire,
^ portion next the median suture, four lines in breadth, is separated from the
maxillary bone by a longitudinal harmonia, and corresponds with the position

of the nasal bone in the Crocodile.

   On comparing the structure of the cranium of the Lahyrinthodon with the

existing Batrachiaus, it is true that an important modification will be found
to exist. In botli the caducibranchiate and perennibranchiate species, tiie
upper maxillary bones do not extend horizontally over the upper surface of
the skull, but leave a very wide interval between the maxillary and nasal
bones ; and the palatal processes of the former contribute as little to form the
floor of the nasal cavity : in the Crocodiles, on the contrary, the palatal pro-
cesses of the maxillary bones extend horizontally inwards, and meet at the
middle line of tlie roof, forming an unbroken floor to the nasal cavity. In
tiie Lahyrinthodon the superior maxillary bones, as already shown, extend in-
wards to the nasal bone, constituting with it a continuous roof to the nasal
--184 REPORT 1841.

cavities ; but the palatal processes, instead of reaching to the middle line, as

in the Crocodiles, are very narrow, as in the Batraclda. The osseous roof of
the mouth is principally composed of a pair of broad and flat bones, analogous
to the divided vomer in Batrachia, but of much greater relative extent, ap-
proaching, in this respect, those of the Menopome, and defending the mouth
with a more extensive roof of bone than exists in any Lacertian reptile : phy-

siologically, therefore, the Labyrinthodon, in this part of its structure, comes
nearest to the Crocodile ; but the structure itself, morphologically, is essen-

tially Batrachian. In the Menopome and gigantic Salamander, a row of small

teeth extends transversely across the anterior extremity of the vomerine bones
and the occurrence in the Lahyrintliodon of a similar row, consisting in each*
palatine bone of three median small teeth and two outer larger ones, marks
most strongly its Batrachian nature ; and from the outermost tooth a longi-
tudinal row of small and equal-sized teeth is continued backward along the

exterior margin of the palatine bone. The Avhole of this series of palatal

teeth is nearly concentric with the maxillary teeth.

    In Lacertine reptiles the examples of a row of palatal teeth are rare, and,
when present, it is short, and situated towards the back of the palate, upon
the pterygoid bones, as in the Iguana and Mosasaur. In Batrachians the most

common disposition of the palatal teeth is a transverse row placed at the ante-
rior part of the divided vomer, as in Frogs, the Menopome and gigantic Sala-
mander, and at the posterior part in certain toads. In the Amphiume, on the

contrary, the palatal teeth form a nearly longitudinal series along the outer

margin of the vomerine bones. The Lahyrintliodon combines both these dis-
positions of the palatal teeth, which are arranged transversely across the fore
part of the divided vomer and extend backwards along its outer margin.

No teeth are placed on the pterygoid bones at the back of the palate as in

the Saurians with palatal teeth. The posterior palatine apertures are, how-
ever, more completely circumscribed by bone than in most Batrachians, and
occupy the same relative position as in the Iguana. The posterior margin

only of one of the anterior apertures is exhibited in the specimen here de-
scribed, but from its curve I infer that the two apertures are not confluent,

as in the Crocodile, the Frog, or the Menopome, but that they are distant,

as in the Iguana.

   From the physiological condition of the nasal cavity it may be concluded

that the Labyrinthodon differed from the Batrachians and resembled the Sau-
rians in having distinct posterior nasal apertures surrounded by bone, and that

its mode of respiration was the same as in the higher air-breathing reptiles.
In the shedding and renewal of the maxillary and the transverse palatal teeth,
it is evident that the process took place alternately in each row, as in many
iishes, M-hereby the dental series was always kept in an efficient state.

    Another instructive fossil is a portion of the left ramus of an under jaw
of Lahyrintliodon leptognatlms from the War^-ick sandstone. It is six inches
long, slender and straight, the syniphysial extremity is abruptly bent in-
wards, and it presents almost as striking a Batrachian character as any of the
bones just mentioned. The angular piece is of great breadth, and is con-
tinued forward to near the symphysis, forming the whole of the inferior part
of the jaw, and extending upon the inner as far as upon the outer side of the

ramus, the inner plate performing the function of the detached os operculare

in the jaw of Saurians. The dentary bone is supported upon a deep and wide
groove along the upper surface of the angular piece, which also projects be-
yond the groove, so as to form a strong convex ridge on the external side of
the jaw, below the dentary piece. This character, which in the large bull-frog
{Rana pipiens) is confined to the posterior part of the maxillary ramus, is
in the Lubyrinthcdon continued to near the anterior extremity. The teeth
ON BRITISH FOSSIL REPTILES.  185

are long and slender, gradually diminishing in size towards the anterior portion
of the jaw, and the fragment presents a linear series of not less than fifty
sockets, placed alternately a little more internally ; and at the anterior in-

flected part of the jaw is the base of the socket of a large tooth. The ante-
rior portion of the jaw being broken off', it is uncertain if the serial teeth were
continued externally to the anterior tusk, which is a remarkable ichthyoid

character noticed in another species of Lahyrinthodon.

   The sockets of the teeth are shallower than in the upper jaw ; the outer wall
is more developed than the inner, and the anchylosed bases of the teeth more
nearly resemble, in their oblique position, those of existing Batrachia. With
regard to the modification of the microscopic structure of the teeth, I may ob-
serve that, between the apex and the part where the inflected vertical folds of
the cement commence, the tooth resembles, in the simplicity of its intimate

structure, that of the entire tooth of ordinary Batrachia and most reptiles
and in the lower or basal half of the tooth the structure described in the works
before quoted commences, and gradually increases in complexity.

   From the long and slender character of this ramus, the length of the head,
as compared with the breadth, approximates more nearly to Crocodilian pro-
portions than to tlie ordinary Batrachian ones ; but among existing Batrachia
it resembles most nearly the Amphiume.

   A dorsal vertebra from Coton End presents further evidence of the Batra-

chian nature of the Lahyrinthodon. It has concave articular cavities at the

extremities of the body, a condition now known, among existing reptiles, only

in the Geckos, and in the lower or perennibranchiate division of Batrachians.

It is a common structure in extinct Saurians, but the depth of the vertebral

articular cavities in the Lahyrinthodon exceeds that in the Amphiccelian Cro-

codilians and in most Plesiosaurs. The body of the vertebra is elongate and

subcompressed, with a smooth but not regularly curved lateral surface, termi-
nating below in a slightly produced, longitudinal, median ridge ; and it ex-
hibits the same exceptional condition in the Reptilian class as do the vertebrae
of existing Batrachians, in having the superior arch or neurapophysis anchy-

losed with the centrum. From each side of the base of the neural arch a thick

 and strong transverse process extends obliquely outwards and upwards.

   A symmetrical bone, resembling the episternum of the Ichthyosaurus, was

associated with the preceding remains. It consists of a stem or middle, which

gradually thickens to the upper end, where cross-pieces are given off at right
angles to the stem, and support on each a pretty deep and wide groove indi-

cating strongly the presence of clavicles, and thus pointing out another di-
stinction from Crocodiles, in which clavicles are wanting. Most Batrachians

possess these bones.

    The modifications of the jaws, and more especially those of the bony palate

 of the Lahyrinthodon leptognathus, prove the fossil to have been essentially
 Batrachian, but with affinities to the higher Sauria, leading, in the form of the

 skull and the sculpturing of the cranial bones, to the Crocodilian group, in

 the collocation of the larger fangs at the anterior extremities of the jav's to
 the Plesiosaurus, and in one part of the dental structure, in the form of the
 episternum, and the biconcave vertebra;, to the Ichthyosatiriis. Another

 marked peculiarity in this fossil is the anchylosis of the base of the teeth to
 distinct and shallow sockets, by which it is made to resemble the Sphyrasna

 aiul certain other fishes. From the absence of any trace of excavation at the

 iimer side of the base of the functional teeth, or of alveoli of reserve for the

 successional teeth, it may be concluded that the teeth were reproduced, as iu
 the lower Batrachians and in many fishes, especially the higher Chondroptery-

Amgii, which formed t\ia jjhibia Nantes of Linnaius, in the soft nmcous mem-

 brane which covered the alveolar margin, and that they subsequently became

fixed to the bone by anchylosis, as in the Pike and Lophius. This anatomical

fact militates strongly against the idea tliat the Labyrinthodon is a Saurian *.

long, of a right ramus of a lower jaw, in addition to the characters common to it

and the fragment of the lower jaw of the L. leptognathus, in the structure of

the angular and dentary pieces, shows that the outer wall of the alveolar process

is not higher than the inner, as in Frogs and Toads, the Salamanders and Me-

nopome, in all of which the base of the teeth is anchylosed to the inner side

of an external alveolar plate. The smaller serial teeth ai'e about forty in num-

ber, and gradually diminish in size as they approach both ends, but chiefly so
towards the anterior part of the jaw. The sockets are close together, and the
alternate ones are empty. The great laniary teeth were apparently three in

each symphysis, and the length of the largest is considered to have been one

Aand a half inch.  section through the base of the anterior tusk above the

socket exhibits the structure described in the Proceedings of the Geological

Society, January, 1841, but a section of the second tusk, also taken above the

socket, shows a less complex modification of the labyrinthic arrangement, one,

viz. which is closely analogous to that at the base of the teeth of the Ichthyo-
saurus. The apical half of the tusks has a smooth and polished surface, and

the pulp-cavity is continued, of small size, into the centre of this part of the

tooth. In the serial teeth, which in other respects, except size, correspond

with the preceding description of the tusks, the central pulp-cavity is more

quickly obliterated, but the alveoli are large, moderately deep and complete:
the texture of the teeth is dense and brittle. The base of each tooth is an-

chylosed to the bottom of its socket, as in Scomberoid and Sauroid fishes; but

the Labyrinthodon possesses a still more ichthyic character in the continua-

tion, preserved in this specimen, of a row of small teeth anterior and external

Ato the two or three larger tusks.  double row of teeth thus occasioned does

not exist in the maxillary bones, either superior or inferior, of any Saurian

I'eptilef ; but in Batrachia it has been noticed in the lower jaw of the Ccecilia,

and it is not an uncommon structure in fishes.

  A fragment of the superior maxillary bone manifests a striking deviation

from the Crocodilian type of structure in the continuation of the palatal plate

of the intermaxillary bone for about an inch to the outer side of the base of

the external plate or process ; while in the Crocodiles the external wall of the
intermaxillary bone is united by the whole of its outer margin with the maxil-

lary, and is thence continued along the whole outer contour of the intermax-

illary bone. Now in the Labyrinthodon the intermaxillary bone presents the

same peculiar modification of the Batrachian condition of this bone as in the

higher organized Batrachia, the palatal process of the intermaxillary extending

beyond the outer plate both externally and, though in a less degree, internally,
where it forms part of the boundary of the anterior palatal foramen, whence
the outer plate rises in the form of a compressed process from a longitudinal
tract in the upper part of the palatal process ; it is here broken off' near its

margin, and the fractured surface gives the breadth of the base of the outer

   * It would be highly desirable to determine in how many of the characters above detailed
the Nothosaurus mirabilis, Muenster, may dexdate, like the Labyrinthodon, from the Saurian

type of structure : it would seem to connect the Plesiosaurus with the Labyrinthodon.

plate, stamping the fossil with a Batrachian character conspicuous above all
the Saurian modifications by which the essential nature of the fossil appears
at first sight to be masked.

    In the anterior frontal bone there are indications of Crocodilian structure.
Its superior surface is sHghtly convex and pitted with irregular impressions
and from its posterior and outer part it sends downwards a broad and slightly
concave process, which appears to be the anterior boundary of the orbit. This
process presents near its upper margin a deep pit, from which a groove is con-
tinued forwards ; and in tlie corresponding orbital plate of the Crocodile there
is a similar but smaller foramen.

   From these remains of the cranium of the Lah, pachygnathus, it is evident

that the facial or maxillary part of the skull was formed in the main after the

Crocodilian type, but with well-marked Batrachian modifications in the in-

termaxillary and inferior maxillary bones. The most important fact which
they show is, that this Sauroid Batrachian had subterminal nostrils, leading to
a wide and shallow nasal cavity, separated by a broad and almost continuous
palatal flooring f om the cavity of the mouth ; indicating, with their horizon-

tal position, that their posterior apertures were placed far behind the anterior
or external nostrils; whereas in the air-breathing Batrachia the nasal meatus
is short and vertical, and the internal apertures pierce the anterior part of the

pjilate. It may be inferred, therefore, that the apparatus for breathing by

i-nspiration must have been present in the habyrinthodon as in the Crocodile
and hence still further, that the skeleton of the Labyrinthodon will be found
to be provided with well-developed costal ribs, and not, as in most of the exist-
ing Batrachians, with merely rudimentary styles. Since the essential condi-
tion of this defective state of the ribs of Batrachians is well known to be their
fish-like mode of generation and necessary distension of the abdomen, it is
probable that the generative economy of these fossil reptiles, in which the
more complete ribs would prevent the excessive enlargement of the ovaria

and oviducts, may have been similar to that of Saurian reptiles.

   A fragment of a vertebra of Lab. pachygnathus presents analogous charac-

ters to the vertebra of the Lab. leptognathus previously noticed.

   Of the few bones of the extremities whicii have come under my inspection,

 one presents all the characteristics of the corresponding part of the humerus
 of a toad or frog, viz. the convex, somewhat transversely extended articular
 end, the internal longitudinal depression, and the well-developed deltoid ridge.
 The length of the fragment is two inches, and the breadth is thirteen lines.
 The ridges are moderately thick and compact, with a central medullary ca-
 vity. In its structure as well as in its general form, the present bone agrees
 with the Batrachian, and differs from the Crocodilian type.

     In the riglit ilium, about six inches in length, and in the acetabulum, there
is a combination of Crocodilian and Batrachian characters. The acetabular
 cavity is bounded on its upper part by a produced and sharp ridge, as in the
 frog; and not emarginate at its anterior part, as in the crocodile. Above the
 acetabulum in the frog the ilium gives off a broad and depressed process, the
 lower extremity of which is separated from the acetabulum by a smooth con-
 cave groove, I)oth of which are wanting in the crocodile, there being only a
 slight rising of the upper border of the acetabulum. These characters, how-
 ever, are well developed in the Labyrinthodon : but the process, instead of
 being depressed, is compressed, and its internal extremity is pointed and bent
 forwards, representing the rudiment of the long anterior process of the ilium
 in i\w. Batrachia anoura ; but it does not attain in the Labyrinthodon the par-
 allel of the anterior margin of the acetabulum, and the bone terminates in a
 thick truncated extremity a few lines anterior to tlie acetabidum ; which gives
 an essential feature of resemblance to the Crocodiles and difference from the
--188 BEPORT 1841.

Batrachians. But the most marked difference in this fossil from the crocodile
is the length of the ilium posterior to the acetabulum, in which it agrees with
the analogous portion of the frog and other tailless Batrachians ; while, on
the contrarj'^, there is an agreement with the Crocodilian type in the mode of
articulation to the vertebral column. In the frog a transverse process of a
single vertebra abuts against the anterior extremity of the produced ilium.
In the crocodile the transverse processes of two vertebrae are thickened and
expanded, and joined to a rough, concave, articular surface occupying the
inner side of the ilium, and a little posterior to the acetabular cavity. In the

Labi/rinthodon is a similar well-marked, rough, elongated, concave, articular
surface, divided by a non-articular surface, and destined lor the reception of

the external extremities of two sacral ribs. The Labyrinthodon likewise
agrees with the crocodile in the lower part of the acetabulum being com-
pleted by the upper extremity of the pubis, the anterior and inferior part of

the ilium oifering an obtuse process at the posterior part of the lower boun-

dary of the acetabular cavity.

   As the fragment of the ilium was discovered in the same quarry as the two

fragments of the cranium and the portion of the lower jaws, it is probable
that they niay have belonged to the same animal ; and if so, as the portions
of the head correspond in size with those of the head of a crocodile six or
seven feet in length, but the acetabular cavity with tliat of a crocodile twenty-
five feet in length, then the hinder extremities of the Labyrinthodon must
have been of disproportionate magnitude compared with those of existing Sau-
rians, but of approximate magnitude with some of the living anourous Batra-
chians. That such a reptile, of a size equal to that of the species whose re-
mains have just been described, existed at the period of the formation of the

New Red Sandstone, is abundantly manifested by the remains of those singu-

lar impressions to which the term Cheirotheriiim has been applied. Other
impressions, as those of the Clieirotherium Hercules, correspond in size with
the remains of the Labyrinthodon Salamandraides, which have been dis-
covered at Guy's Cliff. The head of a femur from the same quarry in which
the ilium was found exactly fits the acetabulum or the articular cavity of that

bone. The two toe-bones, or terminal phalanges, resemble those of Batra-
chians in presenting no trace of a nail, and from their size they may be re-

ferred to the hind-feet of the L. pachygnathus.

   Thus, all these osseous remains from the Warwick and Leamington sand-
stones agree with each other and with the fossil remains of the great Masto-
donsaurus Salamandroides of the German keuper in their essentially Batra-

chian nature. Now it has been suggested by more than one Palteontologist

that the impressions of the Cheirotheriiim may have been the foot-prints of

aBatrachian; but, in consequence of the peculiarities of the impressions, it
is obvious that the animal must have been quite distinct in the form of its

feet from any known Batrachian or other reptile. In the attempt to solve
the difficult problem of the nature of the animal which has impressed the

New Red Sandstone with the Cheirotherian foot-prints, we cannot overlook

the fact that we have in the Labyrinthodon also a Batrachian reptile, differ-

ing as remarkably from all other Batrachians, and from every other reptile in
the structure of its teeth : both the footsteps and the fossils are, moreover,

peculiar to the New Red Sandstone ; and the hypothesis that the footsteps of

the Cheirotheriiim are those of the Labyrinthodo7i, which I have proposed in

my Memoir read before the Geological Society, may be allowed to be sup-

--ported by more facts than had before been brought to bear upon the question.
   Labyrinthodon scutidatiis. The remains, to Avhich this specific designation
has been applied, composed a closely and irregularly aggregated group of
bones imbedded in sandstone, and manifestly belonging to the same skeleton;
                 ON BRITISH FOSSIL REPTILES.              189

they consist of foui* vertebrtE, portions of ribs, a humerus, a femur, two tibiae,

one end of a large flat bone, and several small osseous, dermal scutes. The
mass was discovered in the new red sandstone at Leamington, and was trans-
mitted to me by Dr. Lloyd in the summer of 1 840.

The vertebras present biconcave articular surfaces similar to those of the

other species. In two of them, the surfaces slope in a parallel direction ob-

li((uely from tlie axis of the vertebrse, as in the dorsal vertebrije of the frog,

indicating an habitual inflexion of the spine, analogous to that in the humped

back oi' the frog. The neurapophyses are anchylosed to the vertebral body.

Tlie spinous process rises from the whole length of the middle line of the

neurapophysial arch, and its chief peculiarity is the expansion of its elongated

summit into a horizontally flattened plate, sculptured irregularly on the upper

Asurface.  similar flattening of the summit of the elongated spine is exhi-

bited in the large atlas of the toad. The body of the vertebra? agrees with

tliat of the L. leptognathus. The humerus is an inch long, regularly convex

at the proximal extremity, and expanded at both extremities, l)ut contracted

Ain the middle.  portion of a somewhat shorter and flatter bone is bent at

a subacute angle with the distal extremity, and resembles most nearly the

anchylosed radius and ulna of the Batrachia.

The femur wants both the extremities ; its shaft is subtrihedral and slightly

bent, and its walls are thin and compact, including a large medullary cavity.
The tibias are as long, but thicker and stronger than the femur. They had

lost their articular extremities, but exhibited that remarkable compression of

their distal portion which characterizes the corresponding bone in the Ba-

trachia : they likewise have the longitudinal impression along the middle of

the flattened surface. The length of the more perfect shaft is 2 inches 1 line.
   With respect to the osseous dermal scuta, tliough they form a striking in-

stance of tlie Crocodilian affinities of the Leamington fossil, yet as these de-

tached superficial bones are the most liable to be separated from the frag-

mentary skeleton of the individual they once clothed, the negative fact of

their not having been found associated with the remains of the Labyrintho-

don in other localities, proves nothing in regard to a difference of dermal

structure between the Leamington and Warwick species. Indeed no anato-

mist can contemplate the extensive development and bold sculpturing of the

dermal surface of cranial bones in the Lahyrinthodon pachygnathus and L.

leptognathus without a suspicion, that the same character may have been mani-

fested in bony plates of the skin in other parts of the body. Admitting for
a moment this structure to be proved, to what extent, it will be asked, does

it aflect the claims of the LahyrintJiodonto be admitted into the order of Ba-

trachians, in which every known species is covered with a soft, lubricous and

naked integument, without scales or scuta ? In reply, I have observed*, that

the skin is the seat of variable characters in all animals ; and, if considered

apart from the modifications of the osseous and dental systems, is apt to mis-

lead the naturalist who is in (|uest of the real affinities of a species : thus we
have in the Trionyx an example of a soft-skinned animal among Chelonian

reptiles.

                                SUMMARY.

  A retrospective glance at the catalogue of Reptiles which formerly existed

on that portion of the earth's surface constituting the present small island of
Britain, and which are noAv extinct, must call forth such novel and surprising re-
flections on the dealings of Providence with the animated beings of this planet,

as may well lead, in the first place, to a questioning of the truth of the af-
firmations with which the present summary commences. Did the numerous,

strange, and gigantic representatives of the several orders of Reptiles actually

at any time live and move and propagate their kind in the localities where
their bones are now so abundantly found ? Are not these bones the relics

rather of antediluvian creatures, which perished in the great historical Cata-
strophe of Water, and have been washed from latitudes suitable to their exist-
ence to more northern shores ? Are the British Fossil Reptiles actually

extinct, and may not some living representatives of the Labyrinthodons,
Enaliosaurs, Dinosaurs, &c., still remain to be discovered in those warmer
regions where alone large species of reptiles are now known to exist ?

   Such questions and explanations of the phaenomena which are the subject
of the present Report will be most likely to suggest themselves to those who are

not conversant with the truths of Geology, and who may never have been eye-

witnesses of the circumstances under which fossil bones of reptiles are found.

   In many 'cases these circumstances are so opposed to any that can be con-
ceived to have been produced by the operation of a superincumbent bed of
waters upon the present surface of the earth during a period of less than one

year, that the earliest observers to whom the operations of a temporary

general deluge suggested the first explanation of the appearance of the re-
mains of a large and strange animal, were irresistibly led to the conviction
that the conditions under which such fossil animal was found Avere wholly
inexplicable on the supposition of its carcase having been left by the re-

tiring waters of a flood. Thus the good Quaker of Whitby, in his letter

to Dr. Fothergill, recounting the discovery of the extinct species of Croco-

dile that now bears his name ( Telcosaurus Chapmanni), says, " The bones
were covered five or six feet with the water every full sea, and were about
nine or ten yards from the cliff", which is nearly perpendicular, and about sixty
--192 REPORT 1841.

yards Iiigh, and is continually weai'ing away by the sea washing against it:

and, if I may judge by what has happened in my own memory, it must have

extended beyond these bones less than a century ago. There are several regu-
lar strata or layers of stone, of some yards thickness, that run along the cliff
nearly parallel to tlie horizon and to one another. I mention this to obviate an

objection, that this animal may have been upon the surface, and in a series of
years may have sunk down to where it lay, which will now appear impossible,
at least when the stones, &c.. have had their present consistence*."

--It must be obvious, indeed, that the regular succession of horizontal layers,
    "beginning from the top, of earth, clay, marble, stones, both hard and soft, of

various thicknesses, till it comes down to the black slate or alum rockf,"

mounting to the height of near two hundred feet above the petrified skeleton,
could not have been the result of the deposit of a temporary overflow of di-

luvial waters continuing for a few months, supposing even those Avaters to

have been thickly charged with the ruined surface of the old earth. Succes-
sion of strata, as of all other phsenomena, must take place in successive periods
of time ; the hundredth layer of lias, counting downwards, which contained
the skeleton of the strange Crocodile, must once have been the uppermost, and
some time must have elapsed between the deposition of that stratum with its

organized contents and the deposition of the succeeding layer above.
    If the fossilized bones of the animals described in the pi-esent memoir had

been drifted to this island by a flood, they would be found mingled together
in the superficial strata usually termed ' diluvial,' and would characterize no
particular formation or locality. But the reverse of this is the fact ; and it is

the cumulative evidence of the limitation of certain genera to particular for-

mations that gives its chief value to the present class of researches.
   In the most superficial fossiliferous deposits which indicate the last opera-

tion of a body of v/ater, either frozen or fluid, upon the surface of the British

islands, no remains of reptiles have come under my observation. Cuvier alludes

to a single bone of a crocodile said to have been found associated with the
usual fossils of the drift or diluvium at Brentford J : but no other evidence

of any other species or genus of Reptile, which is now confined to warmer

regions of the globe, has yet been recognized in the British strata called di-
luvial, or in any that are more recent than the oldest Tertiary formations.

   In these Eocene beds, accumulated in some localities to the thickness of
three hundred feet and upwards, the remains of crocodiles, tortoises, trio-
nyxes, turtles, and large serpents, are more or less common. These fossils
severally exhibit well-marked and unequivocal specific differences when com-
pared with the bones of their known existing congeners ; but their osteology
does not present any modifications of generic value. The nearest approach
to this degree of deviation occurs in the Eocene Chelonian Reptiles, as in
that species of turtle from Sheppey, which combines the jaws of a Trionyx
with the bony helmet of a Turtle, and presents an extent of ossification of the
buckler nearly equalling that of an Erays. The Eocene Crocodile exhibits
all the characters of the osseous and dental systems M'hich distinguish the
genus as restricted in the latest systems of Erpetology ; and whilst it cannot
be identified with any known species, most resembles, not the commonest and
nearest existing Crocodile, as that of the Nile, but a rarer and more remote
one, viz. the Crocodilus Schlcgelii of Borneo. Not any species of Reptile of
the Tertiary strata has been discovered in the chalk upon which those strata

immediately rest.

A small lizard, closely corresponding in vertebral structure with existing

species, but differing in its dentition ; and a gigantic marine species (3fosa-

saiirus), which is the first, in the present descending survey, to offer osteolo-

--gical and dental combinations wholly unknown in existing Saurians, con-

stitute the representatives of the Lacertian order in the cretaceous beds, which

form the most recent of the secondary deposits.

In tracing upwards the extinct Reptiles we find that the union of the ver-

-- --tebras by a hinder ball received into an anterior cup, a structure which, with

an insignificant exception the Gecko prevails throughout the Saurian order
as it now exists, commences with the Lacertian Reptiles which perished du-

ring the deposition of the chalk, and, in the Crocodilian and Ophidian Rep-

tiles, is first found in the species which made their appearance during the

deposition of the London clay.

Of the Crocodilian order I have yet seen no unequivocal representatives

from the British chalk.

All the well-determined Chelonians of the cretaceous period are marine

species, and are equally distinct, with the Lacertians, from those of the super-

imposed tertiary beds.

The most interesting fact which the Palaeontology of the cretaceous period

has yielded, with reference to the great Saurian division of the class of Rep-

tiles, is the commencement, or rather the last appearance of the fossil remains

of an order of Reptiles {Enaliosauria) now altogether extinct. I have de-

termined portions of the lower jaw with teeth of a large species of Ichthyo-

saurus from the lower chalk between Folkstone and Dover, which is very

closely allied to, if not identical with, the Ichthyosaurus communis. The femur

of a large Plesiosaurus has been obtained from the chalk of Shakspeare's

Cliff. Remains of more than one species of Plesiosaurus occur in the Gault,

and are associated with the Ichthyosaurus in the greensand near Cambridge,

and in the Kentish Rag near Maidstone.

In the greensand also we first meet with evidences of Reptiles exhibiting

modifications of structure, especially of the locomotive extremities, as remark-

able and as different from those of existing species as are presented by the

Enaliosauria, but pointing as strongly to an adaptation for terrestrial life as

does the Enaliosaurian structure to aquatic existence. The specimen of the

unquestionably terrestrial Saurian here alluded to, viz. the Iguanodon, is the

more remarkable in the subcretaceous marine strata, in consequence of its pre-

senting the largest proportion of the connected skeleton of the same indivi-

dual of this species tliat has hitherto been found.

Gigantic Ci-ocodilian Reptiles, removed by generic modifications of struc-

ture from the Eocene and existing Crocodiles, now likewise begin to be in-

dicated, as by the teeth of the Polyptychodon from the greensand quarry at

Maidstone, and by the large bones of the extremities from the quarries of a

corresponding stratum at Hythe.

The Chelonian from the greensand (Chelone pulchriceps) differs from the

Eocene and all existing turtles in a very interesting modification of the anatomy

of the cranium.

In the Wealden group of freshwater strata, the Enaliosaurian order con-

tinues to be represented by the Plesiosaurus, but no remains of the more

strictly marine genus. Ichthyosaurus, have yet been discovered. This cir-

cumstance corresponds with the more strict adaptation for marine existence
which the structure of the Ichthyosaurus presents, and corroborates the in-

ference that the Plesiosaurus lived nearer the shore, and ascended estuaries.

The re-appearance of the Ichthyosaurus in the chalk formations proves that
it had continued to exist in the neighbouring ocean, and indicates, perhaps,

ISll.                            o

that the deposition of the cretaceous beds was related to the formation of the
Wealden group by proximity of time as well as place. The terrestrial group
of gigantic Reptiles receives in the Wealden an accession of two new genera,

viz. Hylceosaurus and Megabsaurus ; and the remains of both these, and
especially of the Iguanodon, are so abundant, that the Wealden strata may

be regarded as the metropolis of the Dinosaurian order *.

   The amphibious Crocodiles might be expected, from their known habits at

the present day, to liave left abundant evidences of their remains in strata,
which seem to have been deposited at the estuary or mouth of some great

river ; in a climate, indicated by its vegetable fossils to have been warmer or
more equable than at present ; and during a period of time which permitted

the accumulation of 1000 feet of strata. Accordingly, the Crocodilian order

of Reptiles has been found to be represented by several distinct genera in the

Wealden formations.

Some new characters and modifications of structure might also have been

anticipated in those Crocodilians which existed at a period antecedent to the

deposition of about 1500 feet of cretaceous strata, which, again, preceded the

formation of the whole series of superimposed tertiary and diluvial beds.

Nevertheless, the remarkable modifications which all the Wealden Crocodi-

lians present in the structure of their vertebrae, as compared with the Eocene
and existing Crocodiles, could not have been anticipated ; and even now that

they are ascertained by repeated observation, some of them still remain in-

explicable in relation to any conjectural habits of the species, or hypotheti-

Wecal conditions under which they actually existed.  may understand why

the ball-and-socket articulation of the vertebras of the present amphibious

Crocodiles frequenting dry land, should be exchanged for a "joint having

elastic substance included between two concave articular surfaces, as a struc-

ture better adapted to Crocodiles more habitually living and moving in water

but these Crocodiles Avith biconcave vertebra are associated with others having

plano-concave vertebrae, and also with a species having vertebrae joined by

ball-and-socket articulations. And the difficulty is not diminished by the re-

markable fact of the latter structure being the rererse of that in i-ecent Ci"o-

codiles, the ball and the cup having changed places in the extinct Strepto-

spmidylus ; and having assumed the position which they present in certain
Sauroid fishes, and in the dorsal and cervical vertebrae of some of the herbivo-

rous Mammalia.

The biconcave, plano-concave, and convexo-concave modifications of the

vertebrae are not the only points in which the extinct Crocodilians of the

Wealden strata diflPer from those of the London clay and from the existing

species. The genus GoniophoUs, for example, exhibits a remarkable deve-

lopment of its dermal armour, the large quadrangular scutes of which, inter-

locked by teeth received into depressions, are gigantic representations of the

scales of some of the Ganoid fishes ; Avhile the smaller hexagonal and penta-

gonal scutes t were articulated together by marginal sutures, as in the dermal

bony covering of the armadillo. The Poikilopleuron exhibits a medullary

cavity in the body of the vertebrae, and a double origin of the spinous pro-

cess. The Suchosaurus offers a very striking change in the form of the

   * Dr. Mantell calculates that not less than seventy individuals of the Iguanodon, varying

in age and magnitude, from the young just escaped from the shell to the mature animal, with
a femur of more than a yard in length, have come under his examination ; and he justly oh-
serves that " more than thrice that number have, in all probability, been destroyed by thg

--workmen, and altogether eluded the observation of the PaJjeoutologist." See his Memoir in

the Philosophical Transactions, 1841.

  t These have been discovered since the first sheets of this Report went to press by my

friend Mr. Holmes of Horsham, in the Wealden strata neai- that town.

teeth. The Ceiiosaurus surpasses all modern Crocodiles in its enormous
bulk, which almost rivals that of the Whales, its successors in the modern

seas. 1 he genus Streptospondylus, which, in repeating the ball-and-socket
structure, offers the strange anomaly of an anterior position of the ball and a
posterior one of the socket, makes its first appearance in the Wealden by a

species which must have been little inferior to the Cetiosaurus in length.

   The huge terrestrial Saurians of the Wealden deviate in so much greater

a degree than the Crocodilians from the existing types, as to render the forma-

tion of a distinct order for their reception necessary.

It does not appear that any of the Chelonians of the Wealden period are

Aspecifically identical with those of the chalk,  new and singular osculant

bgenus, Tretosternon, here represents the Trionyces of the Eocene freshwater
Aor estuary formations.  new species of Turtle, with an Emydian form of

shell, occurs in the Purbeck limestone ; and the head of a turtle from the

Portland stone, upon which the Purbeck beds immediately rest, exhibits the

same distinction of the separate nasal bones, as does the skull of the turtle

from the greensand, but combined with well-marked specific differences in

other parts.

   The Portland stone introduces us to the great Oolitic series, in which we

lose sight of the Jguanodon, Hylceosaurus, Goniopholis, and Suchosaurus,

but find that the Megalosaurus, Poikilopleuron, Cetiosaurus, Streptospon-

dylus, and Plesiosaurus, are genera common to the Wealden and Oolitic

periods.

   Now also the genus Ichthyosaurus, which was represented by a single

species in the chalk epoch, astonishes us by the number of individuals, and
the great variety of specific modifications and varieties of form and bulk,

under which it existed in the oolitic periods ; especially in the older divisions
of the oolite, as the lias. The number and variety of Plesiosaurian Reptiles
are even more surprising, and the modifications of their skeleton being more
marked and various, proportionally facilitate the determination of the species.
The largest of these Plesiosaurian Reptiles deviates, indeed, so far from the
typical structure of the genus as to merit subgeneric distinction. This sub-
genus, the Pliosaurus, characterizes the Kimmeridge and Oxford clays, but

appears not to have existed at the period of the lower oolite.
   In the place of the Goniopholis and Suchosaurus, the Crocodilian genera,

Sfeneosaurus and Teleosaurus, with the subgenera, Aelodon, Mystriosaurus,
Macrospondylus, &c. (separated, perhaps, without sufficient reason, from the
first two typical genera of Amphicoelian Crocodiles), make their appearance
in the oolitic strata, especially in the lower divisions. The long and narrow

snouts, sharp and slender teeth, short fore-limbs, and imbricated scutation of
these extinct Crocodilians, attest, with their vertebral structure, their adapta-
tion to an aquatic life, and to the capture of a prey not more highly or-

ganized than fishes.

   Some small species of Crocodilians and Lacertians have left a few bones

of their extremities in the oolitic slate of Stonesfield ; and a most singular

order of Reptiles now makes its appearance, the skeleton of which exhibits

a modification of the Lacertian type of structure closely analogous to that

by virtue of which the mammalian Bat is endowed with the powers of fiight.

Tiie flying Dragons, called Pterodactyli, were of small size, and are restricted,

--like the Teleosauri and Steneosauri, to the oolitic group. All the other genera

are continued into the Wealden, the Poikilopleuron and Megalosaurus, by

--identical species, the other genera by species which are distinct from those

of the oolite. The Plesiosaurus and Ichthyosaurus existed, as we have seen,

as late as the deposition of the chalk. The analogy between the extinct Rep-

tiles and Fishes, in regard to the great proportion of genera which are com-

mon to the Wcaklen and Oolite, and the small proportion which is continued

into the Cretaceous formations, offers a valuable corroboration of the subordi-

nate character of the Wealden group as a member of the great Oolitic series.
   No species or genus of Saurian represented by fossils from the Oolite has

yet been discovered in older or lower strata in the British Islands. The Rys-
osteus is apparently confined to the bone-bed under the lias, which may be
regarded as the oldest member of the Oolitic series in these islands.

   The Reptiles of the Poikilltic strata exhibit deviations from the typical

structure of the recent families, together with osculant characters joining

groups now distinct, as great and even more anomalous than occur in any of

the preceding extinct genera.

   The Rhynchosaurus of the New Red Sandstone near Shrewsbury manifests

Ornithic and Chelonian modifications, grafted upon an essentially Lacertian
type of cranial structure ; no approach even to the form of its extraordinary
head being made by any other of the extinct members of the Saurian order.
The vertebrae of the Rhynchosaurus differ from those of existing Lizards,
Chelonians, and Birds, and combine the biconcave structure with the oblique
processes and costal articulations of the vertebrae of recent Lizards.

   The -Labyrinthodonts of the same formation exhibit a different but an

equally remarkable combination of characters, Crocodilian modifications being

superinduced upon a fundamental organization of the Batrachian type. The

structure of the teeth in this remarkable family, which is the most complex
that has hitherto been met with in the whole animal kingdom, is unique in
the class of Reptiles, and is but partially and comparatively feebly repeated
in that of Fishes. It is highly probable that the modifications of the loco-

motive extremities were as peculiar as the dental characters, if we may judge

from the foot-prints of the so-called Chdrotherium, to which the Labyrintho-
donts alone have at present an equitable claim.

    Finally, tlie Palceosaurus and other genera of the Magnesian conglome-
rate, like the so-called Monitors of Thuringia, are lizards which combined a
thecodont type of dentition, with biconcave vertebrae, having the superadded
peculiarity of a series of ventricose excavations in the bodies of the vertebrae
for the spinal chord, instead of a cylindrical canal.

   Below the New Red Sandstone system, notwithstanding that the older de-
posits, as the coal-measures, have been more thoroughly explored by man than

any other geological formation, no trace of a vertebrate animal more highly
organized than a fish, has been detected.

From this survey it is evident that many races of extinct reptiles have suc-

ceeded each other as inhabitants of the portion of the earth now forming

Great Britain                                                          their abundant remains, through strata of immense  thickness,
                                                                    ;

show that they existed in great numbers, and probably for many successive

generations. Their coprolites prove that they fed upon organized beings co-

existing with them and characterizing the same strata, but now equally ex-

tinct with their devourers.

To what natural or secondary cause, it may then be asked, can the succes-

sive genera and species of Reptiles be attributed ? Does the hypothesis of

the transmutation of species, by a march of development occasioning a pro-

gressive ascent in the organic scale, afford any explanation of these surprising

phenomena? Do the speculations of Maillet, Lamarck and Geoffroy de-

rive any support or meet with additional disproof from the facts already

determined in the reptilian department of Palaeontology ?

  A slight survey of organic remains may, indeed, appear to support their
                        ON BRITISH FOSSIL REPTILES.                  19?

views of the origin of animated species ; but of no stream of science is it
more necessary, than of Paleontology, to ' drink deep or taste not*.'

   Of all vertebrated animals, the Reptiles form the class which is least fixed

in its characters, and is most transitional in its range of modifications ; the
lowest organized species are hardly distinguishable from fishes, and the highest
manifest so great an advance in all the important systems of their organism,
tliat naturalists are not yet agreed as to whether reptiles ought to remain in
one class or form two. Reptiles are, besides, the only class of vertebrate ani-
mals in which certain species undergo, after birth, a metamorphosis as singular
and extreme as in insects.

   If the progressive development of animal organization ever extended be-
yond the acquisition of the mature characters of the individual, so as to abro-
gate fixity of species by a transmutation of a lower into a higher organiza-
tion, some evidence of it ought surely to be obtained from an extensive and
deep survey of that class of animals which, Avhilst intermediate in organization
between fishes and mammals, prevailed most on the earth during the long

periods that intervened between the time when the only vertebrate animals
were fishes, and the tertiary and modern epochs when mammals have become
abundant, and have almost superseded reptiles in the herbivorous and carni-
vorous departments of the economy of nature.

    In accordance with this not unreasonable expectation, the reptiles of the

Magnesian conglomerate and New Red Sandstone ought to have been organi-

zed according to the type of the most fish-like perennibranchiate Batrachians
and the Fishes of the older strata, if they tended to a higher stage of deve-
lopment, ought, upon achieving the passage to the Reptilian class, to have
entered it at its lowest step.

   It is true, indeed, that the most characteristic Reptilian remains of the

New Red Sandstone do belong essentially, as by their double occipital con-

dyle, their vomerine palatal bones and teeth, &c., to the Batrachian order;

but had the Labyrinthodonts now existed, instead of ranking as the lowest
members of that order, they would most unquestionably have been esteemed

the highest. And, as in the existing diversified order of Batrachia, one family f
represents Fishes, a second | Serpents, a third genus § Chelonians, and a
fourth Lizards; so would the now lost Labyrinthodonts have formed Ba-

                                      II

trachian representatives of the highest order of Reptiles, viz, the Crocodilians.

Here, therefore, we find the Batrachian making its first appearance under its
highest, instead of its lowest or simplest conditions of structure. To use the

figurative language of the transmutation theory, the Labyrinthodonts are de-
graded Crocodiles, not elevated Fishes.

   But the hypothetical derivation of reptiles from metamorphosed fishes is
more directly negatived by the fact, that the Batrachian type is not that
under which reptiles make their first appearance in the strata which succeed
the coal-measures. The Monitors of the Thuringian Zechstein are older than
the Labyrinthodonts of the Keuper ; and among British Reptiles, the theco-

dont Lizards of the Magnesian conglomerate have equal claims to a more

ancient origin.

   The questions, which the unbiased collector of evidence bearing upon the

fixity or mutability of species has next to resolve respecting these primaeval
Lizards, are, whether they appeared under the form of the low-organized spe-
cies which one naturalist classes with Sauria, another with Ophidia, or
whether they exhibit indications of having emerged, by progressive develop-

ment of structure, from any lower organized pre-existing group of cold-

blooded animals ? To these inquiries the Palaeontologist must reply, that

the thecodont Lizards of the Zechstein and Magnesian conglomerates combine

well-organized extremities, with teeth implanted in distinct sockets, instead

of being soldered, as in frogs, to a simple alveolar parapet ; and that there-

fore if they existed at the present day, they would take rank at the head of

the Lacertian order, and not among the families most nearly allied to the in-

ferior reptiles. Neither are the modifications of the skeleton of the Rhyn-

chosaur from the New Red Sandstone such as indicated that singular Lacer-

tian to have been derived from the Ophidian or Batrachian orders ; but, on

the contrary, they connect it more closely than any known recent species,

with Chelonia and Birds.

The nearest approximation to the organization of fishes is made by the

Ichthyosaurus, an extinct genus which appears to have been introduced into

.the ancient seas subsequent to the deposition of the strata inclosing the re-

mains of the thecodont Lizards. The ichthyic characters of this genus of ma-

rine Saurians are not of a very important kind, being limited, like the modifica-

tions of the mammalian type in Whales, to a relationship with locomotion in

water, while all the modifications of the skeleton which are connected with

the respiratory, digestive or generative functions, are conformable with the

highest or Saurian type of reptiles ; such as the cranial anatomy, the large

--size of the intermaxillary bones excepted, the dental structure, which cor-

--responds with that of the posterior teeth in Alligators, the articulation of
--the neurapophyses to the bodies of the vertebras, the complicated pectoral
--arch, the sternum and complete abdominal cincture of ribs*, &c. The circle

of numerous imbricated sclerotic bones reaches its maximum of development

in the Ichthyosaurus ; but this is an exaggeration of a structure feebly sha-

dowed forth in some existing Saurians, and more strongly shown in Birds,

rather than a repetition of the simple bony sclerotic cup in Fishes. By no

known forms of fossil animals can we diminisli the wide interval which divides

the most sauroid of Fishes from an Ichthyosaurus.

This most extraordinary Reptile is a singular compound in which Ichthyic,

Cetacean, and Ornithic characters are engrafted upon an essentially Saurian

type of structure. The Ichthyosaurus is, therefore, just such a form of animal

as might be expected, were specific forms unstable, to demonstrate a mutation

of characters or some tendency towards a progressive development into a

higher and more consistent type of organization. Nor is the field for testing

Wethe transmutation theory less ample than the subject is favourable.  have

the opportunity of tracing the Ichthyosauri, generation after generation,

through the whole of the immense series of strata which intervene between the

new red sandstone and the tertiary deposits. Not only, however, is the ge-

neric type strictly adhered to, but the very species, which made its first abrupt

appearance in the lowest of the oolitic series, maintains its characters un-

changed and recognizable in the highest of the secondary strata. In the chalk

as suddenly as it entered it in the lias, and with every appreciable osteological
character unchanged.

   Of the different species of the Ichthyosaurus, founded upon minor modi-

fications of the skeleton, several appear contemporaneously in the strata where
the genus is first introduced ; and those which remain the longest manifest
as little change of specific as of generic characters. There is no evidence
whatever that one species has succeeded or been the result of the transmuta-
tion of a former species. The tenuirostral Ichthyosaurus existed at the same
time, and under the same external influences, as the stronger and shorter jawed
Ichthyosaurus communis just as the tenuirostral Delphinus Gangeticus co-

                                                                                                               ;

exists at present with the short-jawed porpoise.
    If the relative periods of existence of the different Enaliosaurian reptiles

were not well ascertained, and room were allowed for conjecture as to their
successive appearance on this planet, it Avould be as easy as seductive to spe-
culate on the metamorphoses by which their organic framework, influenced
by varying conditions, during a lapse of ages, might have been gradually
modified, so as to have successively developed itself from an Ichthyosaur to
a Plesiosaur, and thence to a Crocodfle.

  We may readily conceive, for example, the fish-like characters of the ver-

tebral column of the Ichthyosaurus to have been obliterated by a filling-up
of the intervertebral cavities through ossification of the intermediate elastic
tissue, and the Plesiosaurian type of vertebra to be thus acquired. The normal
digits of the fin might be supposed to become strengthened and elongated by
more frequent reptation on dry land, and thus to cause an atrophy of the
supernumerary fingers : phalanges of a more saurian figure might have been
produced by the confluence of a certain number of digital ossicles: the head
might be shortened by a stunted growth of the intermaxillary bones, and thus
be reduced to Plesiosaurian proportions. The teeth might become more
firmly fixed by the shooting of bony walls across their interspaces, as in the

young Crocodiles. If we now elongate the bodies of the vertebra, reduce
some twenty pairs of anterior ribs to hatchet-bones, place the fore-paddles at

a corresponding distance from the head, and the hind-paddles proportionally
nearer the end of the tail, little more will be required to complete the trans-

mutation of the Ichthyosaur into the Plesiosaur.
   If next, in adaptation to a gradual change of surrounding circumstances,

the jaws of the Plesiosaur became lengthened to the proportions of those of
the tenuirostral Ichthyosaur, but at the expense of the maxillary, instead of

the intermaxillary bones, preserving the socketed implantation of the teeth ; if,

to balance the elongation of the jaws the neck at the same time shrank to
nearly its former Ichthyosaurian proportions, with some slight modifications
of the Plesiosaurian type of the vertebras ; if a further development and a
more complete separation of the digits of the fore and hind members were to
take place, so that they might serve for creeping as well as swimming ; if the
exposure of the surface to two different media, and of the entire animal to perils
of land as well as of sea, were to be followed by the ossification of certain
parts of the skin, and the acquisition, by this change, of a dermal armour,
such we might conceive to be the leading steps in the transmutation of the

Plesiosaur into the Teleosaur.

   And if the three forms of extinct Saurians, whose changes of specific and

generic characters have thus been speculated on, had actually succeeded each
otlier in strata successively superimposed in the order in which they have
here been liypotlietically derived from one another, some colour of probability
might attach itself to this hypothesis, and there would be ground for search-
ing more closely into the anatomical and physiological possibilities of such

transmutations. Ichthyosaurus, Plesiosaurus and Teleosaurus are, however,

genera which appeared contemporaneously on the stage of vital existence :

one neither preceded nor came after the other. How the transmutation theory

is to be reconciled to these facts is not obvious ; nor to these other, viz. that

the Teleosaur ceases with the oolite, while the Ichthyosaur and Plesiosaur

continue to co-exist to the deposition of the chalk, and disappear together

alike unchanged ; the Ichthyosaur manifesting as little tendency to develop

itself into a Plesiosaur, as this to degrade itself into the more fish-like modift-

cation of the Enaliosaurian type.

If it were urged that the Strejitospo7idylus, or Crocodile with ball-and-

socket vertebrae, of which the remains occur in later secondary strata, when

the Teleosaur had ceased to exist, might be a modification of the apparently

extinct amphiccelian Crocodile, in which the vertebrae had undergone a pro-

gressive development, analogous to that by which the biconcave joints of the

vertebrae of the Tadpole are actually converted into the ball-and-socket joints

of those of the mature Frog, the facts of both geology and anatomy again

oppose themselves to such an hypothesis : for the remains of the Strepto-

spondylus occur likewise in the Whitby lias, which is the earliest formation

characterized by remains of  the   Teleosaurus                                                    and  the  modifications  of  the
                                                                                               ;

vertebral structure, by which the Streptospondylus differs from its ancient

contemporary, and which it retains unaltered throughout the whole series of

oolitic strata, is no approximation to the ball-and-socket structure of modern

Crocodiles which first appears in the Mosasaurus and the Eocene Crocodiles,

but is the very reverse. As reasonably* might we infer that the Teleosaur was

an intermediate form between the Streptaspondylus and modern Crocodiles,

and that the anterior ball had first subsided, and a sub-biconcave type of ver-

tebrae had been produced before the posterior ball, which characterizes the ver-

tebrae of recent Crocodiles, was finally developed.

   If the present species of animals had resulted from progressive develop-

ment and transmutation of former species, each class ought now to present

its typical characters under their highest recognized conditions of organiza-

tion : but the review of the characters of fossil Reptiles, taken in the present

Report, proves that this is not the case.

   No reptile now exists which combines a complicated and thecodont den-

tition with limbs so proportionally large and strong, having such well-de-

veloped marrow bones, and sustaining the weight of the trunk by synchon-

drosis or anchylosis to so long and complicated a sacrum, as in the order

Dinosauria.

The Megalosaurs and Iguanodons, rejoicing in these undeniably most per-

fect modifications of the Reptilian type, attained the greatest bulk, and must

have played the most conspicuous parts, in their respective characters as de-

vourers of animals and feeders upon vegetables, that this earth has ever wit-

nessed in oviparous and cold-blooded creatures. They were as superior in

organization and in bulk to the Crocodiles that preceded them as to those

which came after them.

There is not the slightest ground for affirming that the proccelian Gavial of

the present day is in any respect more highly organized than the opisthocoe-

lian Gavial of the oldest lias. If the differences of vertebral structure in these

Crocodilians were contrasted, in reference to their relative approximation to

the vertebral structure of the higher animals, the resemblance of the ball-and-

socket joints of the spine of the Streptospondylus to those of certain mam-

mals would give precedence in organic perfection to the primasval Gavial.

If, therefore, the extinct species, in which the Reptilian organization cul-

minated, were on the march of development to a higher type, the Megalo-
ON BRITISH FOSSIL REPTILES.  201

saurus ought to have given origin to the carnivorous mammalia, and the
herbivorous should have been derived from the Iguanodon, But where is the
trace of such mammalia in the strata immediately succeeding those in which
we lose sight of the relics of the great Dinosaurian Reptiles ? Or where, in-
deed, can any mammiferous animal be pointed out whose organization can
by any ingenuity or licence of conjecture, be derived Avithout violation of all
known anatomical and physiological principles, from transmutation or pro-
gressive development of the highest reptiles ?

    If something more than a slight inspection be bestowed upon the organic
relics deposited in the crust of the globe, we learn that the introduction of
mammalia on that crust is independent of the appearance of the highest forms
of Reptiles. The small insectivorous mammals of the lower oolite* are con-
temporary with the most ancient Dinosaur, and are anterior to the Iguanodon.

    The period when the class of Reptiles flourished under the widest modi-
fications, in the greatest number and of the highest grade of organization, is

past ; and, since the extinction of the Dinosaurian order, it has been declining.

The Reptilia are now in great part superseded by higher classes : Pterodac-
tyles have given way to Birds ; Megalosaurs and Iguanodons to cai-nivorous
and herbivorous mammalia ; but the sudden extinction of the one, and the
abrupt appearance of the other, are alike inexplicable on any known natural

causes or analogies.

   New species, genera, and families of Reptiles have constantly succeeded

each other, since the earliest periods in which the remains of this class can
be discerned ; but the change has been, upon the whole, from the complicated

to the simple.

    The Batrachian order, which is first indicated by the large and powerful
Crocodiloid Labyrinthodonts, has dwindled down to the diminutive and de-
fenceless Anourans and the fish-like Perennibranchians. The Saurian order
was anciently represented by Reptiles manifesting the Crocodilian grade of
 organization under a rich variety of modifications and with great develop-
ment of bulk and power : it has now subsided into a swarm of small Lacer-
 tians, headed by so few examples of the higher or loricate species, that it is

 no marvel such relics of a once predominating group should have found a
 humble place in Linnaus's Catalogue of Nature as coordinate members of
 the genus Lacerta.

    Nevertheless some general analogies may be traced between the phaeno-
 mena of the succession of Reptiles as a class, and those observed in the de-
 velopment of an individual reptile from the ovum. Thus the Embryonic

 structure of the vertebrae of the existing Crocodiles accords with the bicon-
 cave type ; and this is exchanged, in the development of the individual as in

 the succession of species, for the ball-and-socket structure as the latest con-

 dition.

    The almost universal prevalence of the more or less biconcave structure of
 the vertebrae of the earlier reptiles thus establishes a most interesting analogy
 between them and the earlier stages of growth of existing reptiles.

   A similar analogy has been pointed out by M. Agassiz, between the hete-

 rocercal fishes, which exclusively prevail in the oldest fossiliferous strata,
 and the embryos of existing homucercal fishes, which seem to pass through

 the heterocercal stage.

 ment of the dermal armour in the Crocodilian genera Steneosaurus, Teleo-

202 REPORT--1841.

saurus, Goniopholis, &c., of the Oolitic and Wealden strata, corresponds
with the prevalence of the well-mailed Ganoid order of fishes in the same

 formations.

    The fossil reptiles, like the fossil fishes, approximate nearest to existing
species in the tertiary deposits, and diiFer from them most widely in strata
whose antiquity is highest.

    Not a single species of fossil reptile now lives on the present surface of

 the globe.

    The characters of modern genera cannot be applied to any species of fossil

reptile in strata lower than the tertiary formations.

    No reptile, with vertebrae articulated like those of existing species, has

been discovered below the chalk.

    Some doubt may be entertained as to whether the Ichthyosaurus communis

did not leave its remains in both oolitic and cretaceous formations, but with
this exception no single species of fossil reptile has yet been found that is

common to any two great geological formations.
    The evidence acquired by the researches which are detailed in the body

of this Report, permits of no other conclusion than that the diff'erent species
of Reptiles were suddenly introduced upon the earth's surface, although it
demonstrates a certain systematic regularity in the order of their appearance.

Upon the whole thej' make a progressive approach to the organization of the

existing species, yet not by an uninterrupted succession of approximating
steps. Neither is the progression one of ascent, for the Reptiles have not
begun by the perennibranchiate type of organization, by which, at the present
day, they most closely approach fishes ; nor have they terminated at the op-

posite extreme, viz. at the Dinosaurian order, where we know that the Rep-
tilian type of structure made the nearest approach to Mammals.

   Thus, though a general progression may be discerned, the interruptions

and faults, to use a geological phrase, negative the notion that the progression
has been the result of self-developing energies adequate to a transmutation
of specific characters ; but, on the contrary, support the conclusion that the
modifications of osteological structure which characterize the extinct Rep-
tiles, were originally impressed upon them at their creation, and have been
neither derived from improvement of a lower, nor lost by progi'essive develop-
ment into a higher type.

   The general progressive approximation of the animal kingdom to its pre-
sent condition has been, doubtless, accompanied by a corresponding progress
of the inorganic world ; and thus, the diff'erences which comparative anatomy

demonstrates to have existed between the vertebrated inhabitants of the
secondary epochs of the geological history of the earth, and the tertiary and
present periods, form legitimate grounds for speculation, not only on the
essential nature and causes of those diflierences, but upon the progressive

changes to which our planet and its atmosphere may have been subject. For

whether there had been grounds for regarding the organic phaenomena of pri-
maeval times as earlier stages in the progressive development and transmuta-
tion of species, or whether, as the closest investigation of these phaenomena

--seems to demonstrate, they have been the result of expressly created and suc-

cessively introduced species, they naturally lead the physiologist to specu-
late on the varying conditions of the surrounding media to which such organic

differences may have related.

   Now Reptiles mainly and essentially diflFer from Birds and Mammals in

the less active performance of the respiratory function, and in a lower and
simpler structure of the lungs and heart, whereby they become, so to say,
ON BRITISH FOSSIL REPTILES.  203

less dependent on the atmosphere, or oxygen, for existence. From their ex-

traordinary prevalence in the secondary periods, under varied modifications
of size and structure, severally adapting them to the performance of those

tasks in the economy of organic nature which are now assigned to the warm-

blooded and quick-breathing classes, the physiologist is led to conjecture that
the atmosphere had not undergone those changes, which the consolidation and
concentration of certain of its elements in subsequent additions to the earth's

crust may have occasioned, during the long lapse of ages during which the
extinction of so large a proportion of the Reptilian class took place. And if

the chemist, by wide and extended views of his science in relation to geology
and mineralogy, should demonstrate, as the botanist, from considerations of
the peculiar features of the extinct Flora has been led to suspect, that the at-
mosphere of this globe formerly contained more carbon and less oxygen than
at present, then the anatomist might, a priori, have concluded that the highest

classes of animals suited to the respiration of such a medium must have been

the cold-blooded fishes and reptiles.

   And besides the probability of such a condition of the zoological series

being connected with the chemical modifications of the air, the terrestrial
Reptiles, from the inferior energy of their muscular contractions, and still
more from the greater irritability of the fibres and power of continuing their
actions, would constitute the highest organized species, best adapted to exist
under greater atmospheric pressure than operates on the surface of the earth

at the present time.

    Through such a medium approaching in a corresponding degree to the

physical properties of water, a cold-blooded animal might even rise above the

surface and wing its heavy flight, since this would demand less energetic mus-
cular actions than are now requisite for such a kind of locomotion ; and thus
we may conceive why the atmosphere of our planet, during the earlier oolitic
periods, may have been traversed by creatures of no higher organization than
Saurians. If we may presume to conjecture that atmospheric pressure has
been diminished by a change in the composition as well as by a diminution

of the general mass of the air, the beautiful adaptation of the structure of

birds to a medium thus rendered both lighter and more invigorating, by the
abstraction of carbon and an increase of oxygen, must be appreciable by
every physiologist. And it is not without interest to observe, that the period

when such change would be thus indicated by the first appearance of birds
in the Wealden strata*, is likewise characterized by the prevalence of those
Dinosaurian Reptiles which in structure most nearly approach Mammalia, and

 which, in all probability, from their correspondence with Crocodiles in the

anatomy of the thorax, enjoyed a circulation as complete as that of the Cro-
codile when breathing freely on dry landf.

   * Foot-prints alone, like those termed ' Ornithichnites,' observed in the New Red Sand-

 stone of Connecticut, are insufficient to support the inference of the possession of the

 highly developed organization of a bird of flight by the creatures which have left them. The
 Uhynchosaur and biped Pterodactyles already warn us how closely the ornithic type may be
 approached without the essential chai-acters of the Saurian being lost. By the Chirotherian
 Ichnolites we learn how closely an animal, in all probability a Batrachian, may resemble a
 pedinianous mammal in the form of its foot-prints.

    The degree in which flying insects can resist noxious gases, which would be quickly fatal to
 the wai-ni-blooded Verteljrates, invalidates the objection to a pi'ogressive change of atmosphere
 having accompanied the prevalence of quick-breathing animals, which might be suggested by
 the Libellutee of the has and by the oolitic Beetles.

     t All existing Reptiles, which have the ribs at the anterior part of the thorax united by
 a head and tubercle to the centrum and neurapophysis of the vertel)rpe, have a heart with
 two distinct ventricles as well as two auricles. The contiguous aortic aiising from the two
 ventricles intercommunicate by an aperture so placed as to be covered by the sigmoid valves
204 ^ REPORT-- 1841.

    The first indications of the warm-blooded classes, it might be anticipated,
would appear, if introduced into the Reptilian era, under the form of such
small insectivorous mammals, as are known at the present day to have a lower
amount of respiration than the rest of the class ; and the earliest discovered
remains of mammalia, as, for example, those in the Stonesfield oolite, are
actually the jaws of such species, with which are combined the characters

of that order, Marsupialia, which is most nearly related to the oviparous Ver-

 tebrata.

    The present speculations are, however, offered with all due diffidence ; the
collection of the evidence requisite for pursuing them to a semblance even
of demonstration is only just begun, and they are thrown out with no other

expectation of utility than as incentives to the chemical considerations of the

nature and possibilities of such atmospheric changes as may be physiologi-
cally connected with the variations of organic nature made known by the re-

searches of the anatomist.

  A too cautious observer would, perhaps, have shrunk from such specula-

tions, although legitimately suggesting themselves from the necessary rela-
tions between the organs and media of respiration ; but the sincere and ardent
searcher after truth, in exploring the dark regions of the past, must feel him-

self bound to speak of whatever a ray from the intellectual torch may reach,

even though the features of the object should be but dimly revealed.

when blood is transmitted equally through them. When the amphibious Crocodile suffers

an interruption in the pulmonary circulation by continued submersion, the aorta from the
left ventricle, by the communication above mentioned, receives venous blood from the over-
charged cavities of the right side of the heart ; but when respiration is in full vigour on dry
land, an undiluted stream of arterial blood is transmitted through the left aorta to the head
and anterior extremities. The Dinosaurs, having the same thoracic structure as the Croco-
diles, may be concluded to have possessed a four-chambered heart ; and, from their superior
adaptation to terrestrial life, to have enjoyed the function of such a highly-organized centre
of circulation in a degree more nearly approaching that which now characterizes the warm-
blooded Vertebrata.

                                         NOTICE.

The two following Reports, as well as the Report by Dr. Lardner on the

same subject, already publislied in the Reports of the British Association

for 1838, have been furnished in compliance with the request of the Com-
mittee to whom the superintendence of the experiments and the grants of
money for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of railway constants was

entrusted by the British Association.
. The Committee originally appointed in 1837 consisted of Mr. H. Earle,
Dr. Lardner, Mr. Locke, Mr. Rennie, and Mr. Macneil, to these Mr. Edward

Woods was subsequently added.
   The engagements of the various members of the Committee prevented

them from giving that personal and individual attention to the experiments
which were so highly desirable, and but for the continued and indefatigable
exertions of Dr. Lardner, Mr. H. Earle, and Mr. E. Woods, the object of the
Association could never have been carried out.

   Of the two following Reports, the one is in continuation and conclusion of

that which has already appeared by Dr. Lardner ; the other is a separate
and independent Report by Mr. E. Woods, referring partly to the same and
partly to a great number of additional experiments.

   The Report of Mr. E. Woods, while it agrees in many important particulars,
differs in others from the Reports of Dr. Lardner, and, when viewed as a
whole, is somewhat different both in its structure and in the manner in which

the conclusions are arrived at, deduced, and reasoned upon.
    Under these circumstances, the Committee of the Mechanical Section of

the British Association at Plymouth were of opinion that the objects of the
Association would be best fulfilled by the publication of both ; the results in
which both agree will be looked upon as extremely valuable both by the
theoretical and practical man, while those in which they differ will form sub-

jects of great interest for future inquiry.

Second and concluding Report on the Determination, of the Mean
   Value of Raihvay Constants. By Dionysius Lardner, LL.D.,

    F.R.S., &c.

By reference to the former part of this Report, it will be perceived that among

the points which remained for furtlier experimental inquiry the principal were

the following

    1. Whether the presence of the engine and tender in front of the train has
any effect in rendering the resistance to the progressive motion of the train,
arising from friction or atmospheric resistance, or both of these combined,
less than it would be if the train were moved forward with the front of the

foremost coach presented directly to the air.

   2. Whether the ybrm of the front of the train produces any sensible effect
on the resistance, or whether any advantage can be gained by the adoption
of a pointed front like the bow of a ship.

   3. Whether, in moving down an inclined plane by gravity, the resistance
206 REPORT-- 1841.

of the air acting against the foremost carriage has a greater effect in throw-

ing the succeeding carriages out of square than it would have if the train

were preceded by the engine and tender.

4. In what manner the resistance would be modified by increasing the

length and weight of the train.

These questions have severally arisen out of objections urged against the

experiments detailed in the former part of this Report, and against the vali-

dity of the consequences therein deduced from them, by Mr. I. K. Brunei,

the engineer of the Great Western Railway, in a report addi-essed to the

directors of that company.

Although, from the general experience of the writer of this Report and of

the other members of the Committee, it appeared that none of these various
objections had much weight, it was considered right to bring them to the

immediate test of experiment.
   It was first objected, " That the circumstances under which the experiments

" were performed were not really, though they were apparently, similar to
" those of any ordinary train in motion ; that the carriages in these experi-
" ments were sent with the square end foremost to meet and receive the full
" resistance due to their surface, which is totally different from the case in

" which the engine precedes them." The engine in front, it was stated, would

act as a cut-air or bow, and thus destroy or diminish the resistance produced

by the flat front of the carriage moving foremost.

In order to ascertain the force of this objection, the following experiment

was made.

   An engine called the "Fury" was reduced as nearly as possible to the

condition of an ordinary carriage, by detaching from the axles and removing

from the engine the connecting rods, pistons, working gear, and every mo-

ving part which could produce any mechanical resistance different from that

to which an ordinary coach would be subject. Two coaches were also pro-

cured, and so loaded as to be exactly equal in weight with the engine and

tender.

The engine and tender were then placed at the summit of the Sutton in-

clined plane on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which falls 1 in 89,

for about a mile and a half, and were allowed to descend the plane by their

gravity ; the time of passing a succession of stakes dividing the plane into

spaces of 110 yards, was noted.

The two coaches were next placed at the summit of the plane, and allowed

in like manner to descend, and the circumstances of their descent observed

in the same way.

   It appears, therefore, that the distance run with the wedge foremost dif-
fered only 80 yards in a distance of about eight miles from that through which
the same train ran with its flat front. This and the other differences indi-
cated in the table are evidently such only as would take place Avith the same
experiment twice repeated with the same carriages.

   With a view to ascertain how far mere magnitude of frontage, indepen-

dently of the general magnitude of the train, is productive of resistance, the
front of a coach was enlarged by boards extending from either side to a di-
stance of about twenty inches, adding about twenty-four square feet to the
front surface, and forming a sort of wings in front of the carriage, but no
corresponding Avidth being given to any other part of the carriage. The
coach thus prepared was placed at the summit of the Sutton plane, and al-
lowed to descend from a state of rest. It was then brought back to the sum-
mit and the wings removed, and was allowed to descend in its ordinary
state. The result of these two experiments was as follows :
216 REPORT 1841.

auce is produced by the form of either end of the train, at least within any
practical limits, to which the variation oT that form can be subject.

    In order to ascertain whether the open spaces between the successive car-
riages forming the train had any effect upon the resistance, hooks were at-
tached to the edges of the ends of the several coaches, by means of which
canvas was stretched from coach to coach so as to cover in those open
spaces, and convert the train into a single unbroken column. The train thus
prepared was the same train of eight coaches used in the former experiments,

and the following are the details of the experiments made on the Madeley

planes.

   On comparing the general results of this experiment with those of the same

train in its ordinary state,we obtain the following comparative table of effects.
ON RAILWAY CONSTANTS.                                                219

  AIn the third column F expresses a favourable wind, an adverse wind, C

nearly calm, CC a dead calm, and S a side wind.

   The last experiment with a train of eight coaches, weighing nearly forty
tons, shows that, in a dead calm, the resistance of that train at $\\ miles an
hour amounted to the eighty-ninth part of its weight ; whereas the common
estimate of the resistance of such a train at that speed has been hitherto about
the 250th part of its weight ! This fact alone, were it unconnected with any
others, would sufficiently illustrate the enormous extent of error which has
prevailed hitherto in such estimations in railway practice. The third expe-

riment with eight carriages was made with a side wind, the effect of which is
abundantly manifested by the speed expressed in the last column. While

the same train, moving with a fair wind down the Madeley plane, had a re-

sistance equal to the 177th of its weight, at 26 miles an hour, its resistance
with a side wind was of greater amount at 17"7 miles an hour. The relative
effects of a fair and adverse wind are likewise exhibited in the third and
fourth experiments with six coaches, down the Whiston plane. The velocity,
which gives a resistance equal to the 96th part of the load, was 34^ miles an

hour with a fair wind, and only 27J with an adverse wind.
   It is evident, from these experiments, that the manner in which the atmo-

sphere resists a railway train, whatever it be, depends on the number of

coaches forming the train, and that the foremost coaches do not, by clearing

a passage for those which succeed them, produce any diminution of the total

resistance, which is worthy of attention in practical operations.

The writer of this Report pointed out long since a probable source of re-

sistance, which the results above stated entitle to some attention.

The wheels of the several carriages produce vortices of air around them,

Aand play in some measure the part of fanners or blowers.           considerable

force must be absorbed by so great a number of these wheels moving at

such a velocity. In a train of eight carriages we have thirty-two three-feet

wheels playing these parts of blowers, and revolving from four to five times

in a second. How much force must be expended in maintaining such a

motion, it is needless to say. But, besides this, another circumstance was

observed. In these experiments, as well as in general railway practice, it is

found that an extensive current of air moves beside a train, the current di-

minishing in velocity as the distance from the train increases. Immediately

contiguous to the side of the coaches the air moves with little less velocity

than the coaches themselves. Outside that is another current, moving at a

less rate, and beyond that another at a further diminished rate. There is

thus a succession of currents, one outside another, exending to a consider-

able distance at each side of the train. All the resistance produced by the

lateral friction of each of these currents upon each other must be brought

to the account of the aggregate resistance to the moving power ; and it is

evident that these resistances will depend on the length of the train and the

bulk of the coaches which form it.

   The following are the details of other experiments made on various gra-

dients, with a view of illustrating the same practical principles.

--233 REPORT 1841,

   The obvious tendency which this body of experiments had to support, a prin-

--ciple which the author of this Report had advanced and supported before

a Committee of the House of Lords in the year 1835, but which then and

--ever since was declared by engineers to be paradoxical and absurd, and one

which had no foundation in practice suggested the trial of one extended
experiment, by which the truth or falsehood of that doctrine would be put

beyond all doubt. The doctrine referred to vf&s, that a railway laid doivn
with gradients not exceeding twenty feet a mile would be for all practical pur-
poses, nearly if not altogether as good as a railway of equal length laid down
from terminus to terminus on a dead level. The grounds on which he advanced
this doctrine were, that a compensation would be obtained on the descending

gradients for the disadvantages of the ascending gradients. This compensa-
tion would be either in time, or power, or both, which would be saved in
the descent ; and he consequently maintained, that a railway graduated
within the limits proposed would be worked at as great an average speed,
 and with as small an expenditure of moving power, as a dead level*.

    If the principle now advanced be admitted, it will follow that the whole
 amount of inconvenience which would ensue from the adoption of eighteen
or twenty-foot gradients would be a variation in the speed of transport. The

 average speed, the time of completing the journey, the expenditure of power,
 the expense of maintaining the line, and supplying it with locomotive power,

would be the same. The great practical importance of these circumstances

 is quite evident.

    To reduce this question to the immediate test of experiment, it was deter-

 mined to prepare an engine and full train of twelve coaches loaded as such
 a train would be in the ordinary traffic of a railway, and to run this train on

 the railway from Liverpool to Birmingham and back, observing the moment

 of passing each quarter-mile post, and obtaining thereby the actual speed
 with Avhich each gradient, from one end to the other of the line, was ascended

 and descended, and the speed on the levels. By taking a mean of the speed

 in ascending and descending the gradients, it would be necessary, if the prin-

 ciple maintained by the writer of this Report were valid, that this mean

 should be exactly or very nearly equal to the speed on the level.

     The experiment was accordingly made on the 16th July 1839, and the fol-

 lowing are the details of it :

may therefore relieve itself from as much atmospheric resistance as is equal

to the gravitation of the plane by slackening its speed. If its speed be
slackened so as to render the resistance equal to that which it would have

upon a level, then the engine would have to work with a less evaporating

power than on a level, inasmuch as the motion would be slower. In practice,
therefore, it never can be needful to slacken the speed so much as to equalize

the resistance with that upon the level. Supposing the evaporating power

to remain the same, the speed need only be slackened, so that with the same

evaporation an increased resistance can be overcome at a speed less than

the level, but not so much less as would render the resistance equal to the

level. This, in fact, is what takes place in practice, as is apparent from the

results above given.

By comparing the average evaporation effected in the above experiment

with the average speed, an approximate value of the mean pressure of steam

on the pistons may be obtained.

The mean rate of evaporation per hour was 89'5 cubic feet of water. The

rate per minute would then be P-iQ cubic feet. Hence, since half the steam

                                                     0"745.

The mean speed of the train being 30'93 miles per hour, the velocity in

feet per minute was 2722. To find the velocity of the piston, this must be

reduced in the ratio of the circumference of the driving wheel to twice the

length of the stroke. But the driving wheel being 5 feet in diameter, its cir-

2L =cumference will be 15*7 feet; and since          3, the velocity of the piston

will be               2722 X -q4-= 520;

Hence the pressure per square inch was 46 lbs. If 14*5 lbs. be deducted for

the atmosphere, there will remain 31*5 lbs. per square inch to overcome all

the resistances, including those of the engine itself.

The sura of the areas of the pistons being 246 square inches, the total

will give 1386 lbs. as the whole tractive force expended on the gross load.

If 1 50 lbs. be deducted from this as representing the force expended on the

engine itself, there will remain 1236 lbs. to represent the actual force ex-

pended in drawing the train, including the tender.

The weight of the train, including the tender, being in this case 70 tons,

the ratio of the weight to the gross resistance will be 126 to 1, and conse-

quently that will represent the mean angle of repose for a train of this mag-

nitude moved at 31 miles an hour.

It may be useful to form an approximate estimate of the proportion in

which the total tractive force of 1236 is distributed between the different

sources of resistance. If we take the friction according to the results of the

experiments detailed in the first part of this Report to be at the rate of 5'5 lbs.

per ton of the gross weight of the load, the total amount of the friction of

the train of twelve coaches and tender, weighing 70 tons, will be 385 lbs.

Thus we shall have

   It follows, therefore, that this train of twelve coaches, engine, and tender,
moving down an inclined plane falling at the rate of 1 in 120, with a velocity

of 30*90 miles an hour, would not be accelerated, and that to move it down
planes of less inclination at the same speed would require an amount of trac-

tive power to be exerted by the engine, which would depend on the inclina-

tion of the plane.

   It was found in this experiment, that the mean evaporating power of the
coke was at the rate of 1 cwfr. of coke to 10 cubic feet of water, or ll"21bs.

of coke per cubic foot of water. This consumption of fuel does not greatly

exceed the common estimate for the consumption of coal in ordinary low-

pressure boilers.

   The results of this experiment are quite in accordance with those of all
the other experiments which have been stated in this Report. Lighter and
smaller trains, moving with the same speed, suffered greater resistance in
proportion to their weight, or what amounts to the same, they acquired less
speed with the same resistance.

   Taking the same estimate of the friction proper, the following table ex-
hibits the total resistances to which trains of different magnitudes were found
in these experiments to be subject when moving at the speeds given in the
fourth column, and the proportion in which these resistances are due to the

different resisting influences respectively :

by curves of a mile radius, is inappreciable, and therefore curves of a much
shorter radius may be safely laid down.

    10. That the mean amount of resistance to railway trains being so much
above the estimate heretofore adopted by engineers, and the resistance from
curves being so much less than their estimate of it, the practical principles

on which they have generally acted in laying out lines of railway will require
serious modifications, all of which fortunately will have a tendency to diminish
the expense and difficulty attending the construction and the working of rail-

ways.
    In consequence of the low estimate of the resistance and the high estimate

of the effect of curves, which engineers in general have heretofore adopted,
great expense has been incurred and difficulties encountered to obtain flat gra-
dients and straight lines. In some cases the gradients have been so levelled as
not to exceed from four to six feet per mile, and the lines have been rendered

so straight, that the curves nowhere have so short a radius as a mile. From

what has been proved in the present Report, it is evident that such lines of
railway will afford no practical advantage over those which have been laid
down with gradients of sixteen, twenty, or even twenty-five feet per mile, and
on which curves of a mile or less radius have been allowed.

   The writer of this Report cannot conclude it without acknowledging the
liberal assistance he has received from the Grand Junction Railway Com-
pany, who supplied engines, carriages, and waggons, without charge, for the
experiments ; also from the Liverpool and Manchester Railw'ay Company, who
allowed many of the experiments to be made on their line.

   Mr. Hardman Earle of Liverpool, has also been of the greatest assistance

in conducting the experiments, several of which were suggested by him.
   Similar acknowledgements are also due to Mr. Edward Woods, engineer to

the Liverpool and Manchester Railway Company. This gentleman super-
intended and directed many of the most Important experiments, and subse-
quently reduced and tabulated them, when the writer of this Report was pre-
vented by professional business from being present.

         Report on Railway Constants. By Edward Woods.

In the first Report, by Dr. Lardner, of the Committee appointed by the
British Association to investigate the mean values of the resistance of trains
moving upon railways, published in the eighth volume of the Transactions
of the Association, the various modes proposed for ascertaining the amount
of resistance to the tractive power were described, and their relative merits

discussed.

   The methods alluded to were

   L By the dynamometer.

   2. By observing the motion of a load down an inclined plane, sufficiently

steep to give accelerated motion.

   3. By putting the load in motion on a straight and level line of railway, so
as to impart to it a certain known velocity, and then observing the rate of

its retardation.

   4. By a combination of the two preceding methods, as resorted to by Le
Comte de Pambour.

   5. By a plan proposed by Dr. Lardner, viz. selecting two inclined planes of
248 REPORT-- 1841.

different acclivities, and observing the maximum loads which an engine can

draw up those planes whilst exerting an equal tractive power.
    At the time of the publication of their first Report the Committee had

--made a number of experiments in accordance with the second method, that

of observing the motion of trains down inclined planes of different degrees of

acclivity, noting whether the motion were accelerated, uniform, or retarded.
Althougli these preliminary experiments were limited in number, and tried
under rather disadvantageous circumstances as respected the weather, the fact
that resistance increased in a heretofore unsuspected degree, in proportion as
the speed of the train increased, was satisfactorily established. In what ratio
the increment tooii place, whether as the square or some other function of
the velocity, could not be determined, the results presenting some trifling
apparent discordances, in consequence of the varying effect of the wind which
prevailed at the time of the experiments. In pursuing their inquiries at a
subsequent period, the Committee have been more fully convinced of the
soundness of the principle which guided them in the selection of the method
they at first adopted, and they have accordingly continued to conduct their
experiments in a similar manner, repeating them with various sizes of trains,
at various velocities, on the Sutton incline of 1 in 89 on the Liverpool and
Manchester Railway, and on the inclines of 1 in 177, 1 in 265, and 1 in 330,
on the Grand Junction Railway.

    It is to be regretted that the weather was not on all occasions perfectly
favourable. In some instances, however, there was not a breath of wind to
disturb the results, especially when engaged at the Sutton incline plane.
Such results deserve great confidence, and are particularly valuable for de-
termining the amount of friction, properly so called.

  A few remarks are necessary on the principle of analysis, adopted with re-

gard to the observations which appear in a tabular form at the end of this
Report. The data given there or elsewhere in the Report are,

   1. The coefficient of gravity on the inclination of the plane.
   2. The initial velocity of the train at some determinate point on that plane.
This may be either zero, as when the train starts from a state of rest, or some

positive quantity.

   3. The terminal velocity at some other detei-minate point on the same plane.
   4. The time elapsed in traversing the space intervening between those two

points.

   5. The space intervening.
   6. The force of gravitation, which in this latitude is known to be repre-
sented by 32^, the velocity in feet per second acquired by a body falling

freely in vacuo, at the end of the first second.

   1. The weight or mass of the train, exclusive of the wheels and axles.
   8. The weight or mass of the train subject to rolling motion, viz. the wheels

and axles.

   9. The radius of the wheels.
   10. The distance from the centre of the wheel to the centre of oscillation.
   From these data, when accurately obtained, the resistance of the train can
be determined with absolute precision, the method turning altogether upon a
comparison between a certain fixed and standard force, the force of gravita-
tion, and the observed force by which the train is impelled in its descent. If
a body move down an inclined plane without encountering resistance, its ve-
locity at any given depth below the level of the point where its motion first
commences will be always equal to the velocity it would have acquired by a
free vertical descent, through the same height. If, then, this standard velocity
be compared with the qbserved velocity of a body which has moved down a
ON RAILWAY CONSTANTS.  249

similar inclined plane to the same point, but which does meet with resistance

in its passage, we at once obtain the means of assigning what amount of re-

sistance it has suffered.

   Some persons have objected to this method, on the ground that. the results
hitherto obtained by it have not always been consistent with each other.
Such inconsistencies, however, may be satisfactorily explained, either on the
supposition of the data not having been correct, or, what is more probable,

from the fact of the existence of unobserved causes of irregularity, such as
the influence of favouring or adverse winds, and differences of friction of the
carriages. It will hereafter be shown what a remarkable correspondence the
motions of the same train exhibit when permitted to descend along the same
plane from the same point of elevation, provided the atmosphere be perfectly
calm. Such correspondence could only exist under the uniform operation

of the same producing cause, and the absence of accidental causes ; and we
therefore conceive that no surer test can be applied to determine the mean
resistance experienced by a train in moving from one point to another down

an uniform inclination, than a comparison between the observed time of its
passage and the time it would have occupied if resistance had been altogether

removed.

   There are three cases of the motion to which the same formula is equally

applicable :

   1. When the motion is accelerated.
   2. When the motion is uniform.
   3. When the motion is retarded.

   In the first case the coefficient (determined by the inclination of the plane)
of gravity is greater than the coefficient of resistance, and therefore the quan-
tity which must be added to the coefficient of gravity to represent the coeffi-

cient resistance is negative.

    In the second case the coefficient of gravity is equal to the coefficient of
resistance, and no correction is required.

    In the third case the coefficient of gravity is less than the coefiicient of
resistance, and the addition to the coefficient of gravity is a. positive one.

   In all cases therefore the coefficient of resistance may be found, by adding

to the coefficient of gravity a quantity (determined by considerations alluded
to in the former Report) which is either negative, or equal to zero, or positive.

 --This quantity may be thus obtained : Multiply the initial velocity (2) in

feet per second by the time in seconds (4). From this product subtract the

space (in feet) passed over (5), and divide the difference by 16j2 times the
square of the time occupied (4). The quotient thus found must be subjected
to a slight correction, owing to the rotation of part of the moving mass, which

correction may be detei-mined by reference to data Nos. 7, 8, 9, and 10.
   The initial velocity multiplied by the time represents the space which the

train would describe were that velocity to remain constant. In the case of
imiform motion, the velocity does remain constant, and the product of the
two numbers equals the space traversed. Their difference, and consequently
the whole quantity dependent upon it, vanishes, and the coefficient of gravity
becomes also the coefficient of resistance.

   In accelerated motion the product of the numbers is less than the space
traversed, and the quantity to be added to the coefficient of gravity is nega-
tive, indicating the amount by which the force of gravity exceeds that of the

resistance. On the other hand, when the motion is retarded, the reverse

takes place, and the quantity to be added is positive.

   Under the condition of uniform motion we are enabled positively to pro-
nounce what is the mean resistance for that particular velocity. When, how-
250 REPORT-- 1841.

ever, the velocity is accelerated or retarded between the two points of ob-

servation, although the mean resistance is known, we cannot state whether
that mean resistance is due to the mean velocity, or to some other velocity

intermediate between the limits of the initial and terminal velocities, because

experience has not yet assigned the law of the corresponding increments of

resistance and speed. It will be sufficient for all practical, and even theo-
retical purposes, to assume the mean resistance as applying to the mean ve-
locity, remarking that the calculations are chiefly made from observations

where the initial and final velocities do not widely differ, thus reducing, as

Afar as possible, the limits of error.  more considerable source of error

arises from the difficulty of obtaining with precision the initial velocity,
owing to our inability to measure the time of passing from stake to stake

accurately to a small fraction of a second. To obviate this, a mean has been

taken from the observed times of traversing one or two spaces, preceding
and succeeding the post at which the actual velocity is required. The errors

are thus diffused over a larger space, and rendered less sensible.

   The carriages employed belonged either to the Grand Junction, or to the
Liverpool and Manchester Company. The former were first class, the latter

second class, but both kinds were closed at the top and sides, presented the
same transverse section, were loaded to nearly the same gross weights, and

in other respects were identical. It is next to impossible to obtain two car-

riages even of similar make, whose friction shall be exactly the same, and

accordingly a slight difference was observed, and it was found on the whole
that the mean friction of the Grand Junction carriages exceeded the mean

friction of the Liverpool and Manchester carriages, a fact which may be ac-

counted for by the latter having been in use for a longer period.

  We shall now consider the results afforded by the tables under the follow-

ing heads :

   1 The Evaluation of Friction proper.

different sizes.

   3. The effect of modifying the form of frontage, and of otherwise altering
the nature of the exterior surface of the train, as for instance, by closing up

the spaces between the carriages, ascertaining also the effect of the engine (as

regards its external configuration in diminishing the resistance).

  --1. TJie Evaluation of Friction, properly so called. On the 23 rd of August

1839, the weather being perfectly fine and calm, three Liverpool and Man-

chester first class carriages, weighing gross l^'S tons, were allowed to de-
scend the Sutton inclined plane from a state of rest, starting from a post

numbered 0, and urged only by the force of gravitation. The experiment
was repeated four times, and the train descended the plane from to 22 post,

a distance of 2420 yards, in the following times respectively :

m m m m1st. 4 28 s. 2nd. 4 25 s. 3rd. 4 23 s. 4th. 4 22 s.

   These results coincide so closely, that we may fairly consider the sum of

the resistances to have been the same in all cases, or at any rate to have de-
creased in only a very slight ratio, in proportion as the axles became better
lubricated by continued running.

   The fourth experiment is chosen as the subject of calculation, to determine

the resistance of the said carriages at very slow velocities. Five separate

computations are made from observations of the times of descent from No.
to No. 1, No. to No. 2, No. to No. 3, No. to No. 4, and No. to
No. 5 posts respectively.

slightly increased amount of friction. It is not thought necessary to enter

into a calculation of their friction on the 8th July, inasinuch as the perform-

ances agree very closely; and with the view of comparison with other sets of

experiments made on the same day, it is considered on the whole fairer to

ascertain the friction on that day, viz. the 12th July.

Five computations are made from observations of the times of descent

value in reference to such a subject ; but they may answer a more useful pur-
pose when applied to express in a condensed form results between which an

analogy has been traced, serving thus as the first steps of a generalization to

be completed only by multiplying observations in every possible way.

   On the 11th July, 1839, the eight second class Grand Junction carriages

were taken to the planes, extending from Madeley to Crewe. The wind, as be-
fore noticed, blew down the plane. The train of eight carriages was thrice

discharged over the head of the plane, at a speed varying from 23 to 26 miles

per hour.

Secondly, one half the train, or four carriages, was dismissed over the head

of the plane at 40'9 miles per hour ; the other half, or four carriages, was dis-
missed at 32*73 miles per hour ; and, lastly, a train of six carriages was dis-

missed at the speed of 25*57 miles per hour.

    1. Eight carriages, weighing gross 40*75 tons, dismissed over the top of
Madeley plane, 1 in 177, at 23*71 miles per hour, accelerated to 24*79 miles
per hour, and varied between 24*79 and 23*54 miles per hour, until reaching

the foot. See Table, No. IX.
   2. Same train dismissed at 23*37 miles per hour, accelerated to 28*21, and

varied between 28*21 and 25*77 miles per hour, until reaching the foot. See
Table, No. X.

   3. Same train dismissed at 26*39 miles per hour, accelerated to 27*05 miles
per hour, and varied between 27*05 and 25*17 miles per hour, until reaching

the foot. See Table, No. XI.

In the first case the maximum speed was attained at post No. 40 ; in the

second case at post No. 48 ; in the third case at post No. 52. Let us com-

pare the times of descent from post No. 40, for instance, to post No. at the

foot of the plane, and deduce from thence the average uniform speed over that

distance of 4000 yards. The times were respectively,

           =5 min. 39*25 seconds  24*1 miles per hour.

           5 . . . 8*25  ...  = 26*4

           5 . . . 18*50 ...  = 25*6

The mean of the whole is 25*4 miles per hour.

   The circumstance of the speed having ceased to accelerate and having be-
come uniform, renders unnecessaiy any calculation of the amount of resistance

for it has been already shown that, in the case of uniform motion, the coefli-

cient of gravity is equal to the coeflScient of resistance. The fraction j-fy in

this instance then represents the coefficient of resistance ; in other words,

12*65 lbs. per ton was the mean resistance encountered by the train of eight car-
riages, tvhen moving at the mean velocity of25'4f iniles per hour.

   Upon reaching the foot of the 177 plane, the trains passed on to a plane of

1 in 265, extending from the post numbered to that numbered 54. The ob-

servations of its motion afford the means of ascertaining the resistance at a
slower uniform velocity.

       1. Eight carriages entered upon the 1 in 265 plane at 24*06 miles per hour

   their motion was gradually retarded to 19*83 miles, over a space of about 3000
   yards, and finally became uniform over the remaining distance.

      2. Same carriages entered the plane at 25*76 miles per hour ; their motion
   was retarded to 20*20 miles, over a space of 3000 yards, and finally became

    uniform, or nearly so over the remaining distance.

       3. Same carriages entered the plane at 25*57 miles per hour ; their motion
   was retarded to 19*02, over a space of 3500 yards, and finally became nearly

    uniform.

The mean of the whole is 1 9*5 miles per hour.

The force of gravity on the plane being expressed by ^^j, 8*45 lbs. per ton

was the mean resistance encountered by the train of eight carriages, when moving

at the mean velocity ofl9'5 miles per /lour.

The train afterwards passed on to a plane of 1 in 330, but suffered throughout

a gradual retardation, showing that the resistance exceeded the gravitating

force on this plane. Were it deemed necessary a computation could readily

be made of the resistance at still slower speeds from the observed rate of re-

tardation, but this has already been determined from the Sutton experiments,

which, from the absence of any disturbing effects produced by wind, are more

to be depended upon.
   The trains of four carriages next require our attention. The fact of so

slight an acceleration as that from 23 to 25 miles per hour, having been pro-
duced during the descent of a plane more than 5000 yards in length, was suf-
ficiently remarkable, and demanded an accurate verification. It was deter-

mined accordingly to make a sort of experimentum crucis, by dismissing the

train from the head of the plane at a velocity considerably exceeding the

maximum hitherto obtamed during any portion of the descent, and to note

whether, instead of further acceleration, an actual retardation would not take
place. The event turned out as had been anticipated.

   The four carriages were dismissed over the top at 40 miles per hour ; their
speed diminished ; when half way down the plane it was reduced to 30 miles
per hour ; and by the time they reached the foot it did not exceed 25"17 miles

per hour. See Table, No. XII.
   The plane, it became evident, was too short to allow the train to acquire the

uniform velocity due to the resistance, otherwise, in all probability, the speed

would have been further lessened.
   The remaining four carriages, composing a train of equal weight with the

former, were now dismissed at 32*73 miles per hour. They were retarded to

22*72 miles per hour, and then continued uniform to the foot, over a space
of 1600 yards. The time occupied in traversing the last 1600 yards was 2'

=23" 22*8 miles per hour. 12*65 lbs. per ton was therefore the mean resist-

ance encountered by this train offour carriages, when moving at the mean ve-

locity of22-S miles per hour.'
   At the top of the 1 in 265 plane the speed of the first set of four carriages

was 25*17 miles per hour. This continued to decrease for 3400 yards, after
which the motion became uniform at 19*2 miles per hour, indicating a resist-

ance of 8*45 lbs. per ton.

   The wind, which up to the time of the last experiment had blown in a di-
rection to favour the motion of the trains down the plane, now veered round

to the westward and fell on the sides of the carriages, tending to press the
flanges of the wheel against the rails. This new source of resistance was soon

rendered evident by the sluggish motion of the second train of four carriages
in the latter part of its course (Table XIII.) ; also by that of a train of six
carriages (Table XIV.), which afterwards descended ; and lastly, by repeating
the experiments with the entire train of eight carriages (Table XV.).

    The Time Tables are given in the App. (see Tabs. XIII. XIV. XV.), but we

deem it unnecessary to draw therefrom any numerical deductions with refer-

Aence to the value of resistance.  comparison of the last trial of the train

of eight carriages with the first three trials of the same train is well worthy

of notice, as illustrating the powerful effects of a side wind. In the first case

the mean initial velocity at the top was 24 miles per houi-, and the mean final
velocity at the foot, 25"4 miles per hour. Under the influence of a side wind,

the initial velocity being 20*07 miles per hour, the final velocity at the foot

M'as only 17*69 miles per hour, with the probability of a further retardation

had the incline been longer.

   The following Table presents a summary of the calculations we have made

of the various amounts of resistance opposed to the different trains, on the lo-

calities and under the circumstances assigned.

The most important results are those relating to the train of eight car-

riages, because this load is the nearest approach to the average size of the

ordinary passenger trains usually travelling upon railways. Thirty miles per

hour is a fair average speed ; and the resistance encountered by such a train

moving at thirty miles per hour amounts, as we have already shown, to

nearly 1 5 lbs. per ton, or almost double the value of friction only. These
are results of an eminently practical tendency, indicating at what expenditure
of power we can expect to be able to transfer a given load, and what degree
of excess of power in the motive force, over and above the power required

to overcome the fi'iction, is necessary to the maintenance of an assigned rate

of speed. The friction may no doubt be made less than 8 lbs. per ton by

proper attention to the accurate fitting and perfect lubrication of the axles,

and to the squareness with which they are placed on the framing, as indeed

is made evident by the fact of certain carriages having run with a friction of
only 6 lbs. per ton ; but it is scarcely probable that a much lower amount
will be attained, nor indeed would the reduction be of much importance in

the economic working of passenger trains, which, from their high velocity,

must necessarily bring into play large and independent soui-ces of resistance.

   Having ascertained the resistance to trains at various speeds, and under
the circumstances in which they are found when employed in the regular
traffic of the road, the attention of the Committee was earnestly directed to

discovering how far any diiference in the external configuration of the train,

and modification of the form of the front or hind surfaces, or any altera-

tion in the shape of the leading vehicle, might affect the resistance it

experienced.

The information obtained in the course of this part of the inquiry is of a

negative rather than a positive nature, proving that certain changes do not

aflPect the resistance, but not satisfactorily pointing to any general principle

whereby we can decide upon what the increase of resistance precisely

depends.

The form of the front and the hind end of a train of carriages is flat, pre-

senting an area of 62 square feet, including a sectional transverse measure-
ment of the area of the axle and wheels, and springs and axle-boxes. To
give the train the power of more readily cutting its way through the atmo-

sphere, a sort of boat-shaped appendage was provided. Two boards, equal

in height to the body of the carriage, were united in front, at an angle, the

vertex being 5 ft. 6 in. before the flat front, and the base 6 ft. 6 in., cor-

Aresponding with the width of the carriage.  single coach, weighing 5*37

tons, was dismissed from post No. 0, at the top of Sutton Plane, first with the
prow applied in front, and afterwards without the prow.

   The engine, it might be supposed, would act as a sort of cut-air to throw

aside the current, and break its force before it reached the flat surface of the

carriage. However improbable such a consequence might be after the indi-
cations just recorded, where a still more decided change of form was made
the subject of trial, it was nevertheless determined to put the case to actual
experiment. Accordingly a four-wheeled engine, the "Fury" and its tender,
were weighted equal to two carriages. The pistons, connecting rods, and

other working gear of the engine, were detached from the driving wheels, so

that the engine should be subject to no other friction save that to which a
carriage is subject. The grate-bars, ash-pan, &c. were removed, in order to

make the engine as light as possible, and to assimilate its weight to that of a
loaded carriage; two carriages were also prepared of equal weight. The
Fury and tender were first dismissed down the Sutton Incline ; afterwards
the two carriages, and their times of descent compared.

   The following is an abstract of the performances recorded in Tables

XX. XXI. :--

--262 REPORT 1841.

   The front surface of a single carriage was enlarged by two side boards,
each extending the whole height of the body of the carriage, and each being
twenty inches in width. The surface thus added was equal to about twenty-
two square feet ; the total surface being therefore increased from sixty-two
square feet to eighty-four square feet. The carriage was made to descend
the Sutton Incline. See Tables XVI. and XVII. The following is an

abstract :

         =One Carriage 5-37 tons.

five and a quarter seconds ; but, iu fact, these differences are quite insignifi-
cant, and equal ones would no doubt have been observed had the train been
allowed to descend twice over in the same condition. It is evident then that
no appreciable change in the resistance arises from closing up the intervals

between the carriages composing a train.
   The inevitable inferences to be drawn from the foregoing experiments are :
    1. That the resistance of a train is neither lessened nor augmented by-

changing the shape of its front or hind ends from flat to pointed surfaces,
with the view of rendering it thereby more capable of cutting through the

air.

   2. That whether an engine and tender, or two carriages of equal weight,
precede the train, the resistance is the same, and consequently the engine has

no effect upon the air, similar to that which the bow of a ship has upon the

water through which it is carried.
   3. That increase of frontage, independent of any increase of the general

magnitude of the train, does not increase resistance. This proposition, at
least, must be considered as true within the limits of the surfaces which were
actually submitted to experiment; the lesser surface being equal to the
transverse section of a train suitable for a railway of 4 ft. 8^ in. gauge ; the
greater surface equal to the transverse section of a train suitable for a seven-

feet gauge, such as the Great Western.
   4. That no additional resistance is occasioned by leaving open spaces be-

tween the carriages, confining the intervals to the dimensions allowed in prac-
tice, and that no advantage is gained by converting the train into one un-

broken column.
   Having proved that the excess of resistance, after deducting friction, re-

quired for its estimation something besides the elements of the dimensions
and form of frontage and of continuity of surface, it became an important
subject of inquiry, what was the element, as yet not taken into account, which

exerted the powerful influence observed.

The reader will doubtless have perceived that the subjects of the experi-

ments hitherto desci'ibed were carriages all of equal magnitude and of almost

equal weight. When, however, the Committee first commenced their inquiry

they made an experiment on the Madeley Planes with a train of five waggons.

These waggons were loaded with iron chairs, so as to weigh precisely six

tons each. They were constructed with high sides and ends, capable of being

removed and laid flat upon the platforms of the waggons, so as to expose a

Whengreater or less bulk of cari'iage alternately to the air.  the sides were

up, the whole frontage or transverse section, including the frames, wheels,

springs, and axle, amounted to 47*8 square feet. When the sides were re-

moved the transverse section was only 23*8 square feet, the surface being

diminished by the area of the front board, whose dimensions were eight feet

by three feet. The train, with its sides up, was placed at the 57th stake, at

the summit of the plane falling one in 177, and was allowed to descend by

gravity from a state of rest. It moved along the successive gradients, and

finally stopped 10,019 yards from the point of its departure.

The sides were next removed and laid upon the platforms of the waggons,

and the experiment was repeated. The train came to rest at 14,058 yards

from the point of its departure.

Minute details of these two experiments will be found in the Eighth Re-

port of the British Association for the year 1838. The value of the results

was only properly understood after the course of the previously mentioned

experiments had been completed, and the observations analysed. Frontage

alone was before considered to have produced the additional resistance cor-
--264 REPORT 1841.

respondent with the increments of speed, but it now became more than pro-
bable that such resistance was in a gi'eat measui'e dependent upon the ^rewcra/
volume of air displaced. The -weight of the displacing bodies in the instance
before us was the same, but their volumes were to each other in a somewhat
greater ratio than 2 to 1, and the effect is sufficiently remarkable. The
train of least volume ran -lOSO yards (or more than 2^ miles) further than
the train of gi'eatest volume, both trains being allowed to descend by gravity
from a state of rest from the same post on the Madeley Plane. This import-
ant fact appears to point out the path in which future investigations should

be conducted.
   The Committee have not had the opportunity of entering further upon it,

but they recommend future experimentalists to direct their attention espe-
cially to the effects of increasing and diminishing the bulk of the trains, the
weight remaining the same. Until more experiments of this nature have
been obtained, we cannot expect to arrive at a complete and satisfactory

theory of resistance.

   One plain and practical inference to be drawn from the fact of the resist-

ance being found to depend in a greater or less degree on the volume of air
displaced in connection with the rate of displacement, is, that the less the
space or bulk into which a given weight of train can be condensed, the less
does the resistance at a given rate of speed become, and consequently the
greater is the economy of moving po\ver.

   If the amount of resistance at present experienced at the ordinary rates of
travelling be susceptible of diminution, the saving will probably be effected
more by alteration in the bulk of the train than by attempting complicated
changes in the mechanical construction of the carriages with the view of

reducing the friction.

   For the ordinary purposes of railway transport, we cannot, indeed, antici-

pate any very material reduction in the space occupied by the different ve-
hicles, but we shall be Avarned of the consequences attending any attempt
at enlarging their dimensions without rendering them at the same time capa-

ble of carrying a proportionally greater load. Especially we shall guard
against the injurious consumption of moving power which may arise from

the provision of more accommodation than is absolutely wanted. When the

tide of traffic sets in one particular direction, it is impossible to avoid having
the trains travelling in the opposite direction encumbered with a useless load
of empty vehicles ; but under ordinary circumstances it would seem practica-
ble, by exercising due foresight, and by a judicious system of management,
to apportion the profitable and unprofitable parts of the load more correctly
and closely to each other.

    In estimating the amount of moving power expended in working a line of
railway, we have to consider,

    1. The character of the line, or nature of its gradients.
   2. The weight as well as bulk of the train to be conveyed over it.
   3. The speed at which the load is required to be conveyed.
    If the resistance to each ton of load on a level railway could be repre-
sented by a constant quantity, at whatever speed the load were moved, it
would become an easy matter to calculate the resistance to be overcome on
any given line and length of railway, and to provide our power accordingly

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

for knowing the weight of the train, multiplying such weight by the coeffi-
cient of resistance, and this product by the length of road, we should at once
obtain the resistance upon an equal length of level railway, and afterwards
adding or subtracting, as the case might be, any increase or diminution of
resistance, arising from ascending or descending gradients, we should obtain
ON RAILWAY CONSTANTS.  265

tlie total resistance. It would follow, then, that whether the load were trans-
ported at 5 or 50 miles per hour the expenditure of moving power would be
the same. But we have already shown that no constant quantity will express
the resistance. The resistance, in fact, is not dependent upon weight merely,

but on speed also.

   Of the three elements proposed as the basis of any computation, the first,
viz. the character of the gradients, is fixed and unalterable. The second and

third, viz. the weight and velocity, may be considered variable. When the
dimensions of the engine are once fixed upon, the maximum of load is in-

deed limited by the tractive power of the engine and the steepest inclination

it may have to ascend, and the speed is limited by the capability of the boiler

to generate steam at the rate required, and of the density sufficient to over-
come the resistance due to the speed. Within such limits the cases actually

occurring in practice must be found to range. And according to the pecu-

liar circumstances of the traffic, a high or low rate of speed, light or heavy
trains will be adopted. Suppose the case of a perfectly level railway, on
which a high average rate of speed has to be maintained. Since resistance
is found to increase with the speed in an accelerated ratio, and since the
boiler requires time for the generation of steam, a very considerable part of

the maximum load which the engine could travel with at a slow speed must

be thrown off" to enable it to accomplish the higher rate. In other words,

the load must be comparatively small ; less, in fact, than the maximum on an

ascending gradient of considerable acclivity. It does not often happen that
the surface of a tract of country over which a railway is projected to pass is
sufiiciently free from inequality and variations of level as to admit a level or
nearly level line to be constructed Avithout entailing great expense in the
formation of embankments, cuttings, and other works ; and it therefore be-

comes a most important and interesting consideration, how far the expenses

of moving power would be increased, and the velocity of transport dimi-
nished, by substituting a line of railway whose section shall be more con-

formable to the general outline of the country ; a line consequently much

less costly, but at the same time presenting a series of gradients, the inclina-
tions of which should not be so steep as to render necessary any loss of mo-

tive power by application of the brakes during a descent.

   As an abstract question of dynamics, the power expended (under the con-

dition that the combined resistances of friction and the atmosphere are con-
stant whatever the speed) would be the same for a train travelling between
two given points on the same level, Avhether the road were level or undula-

ting, making due allowance for the difference of distance traversed. On a

level railway the speed of travelling Avould be uniform throughout, and the
combined resistances alluded to would then, in calm weather, be constant
throughout ; but on an undulating railway the speed of the train would

vaiy. And the question comes to this : W^ill the increased velocity on the

descending gradients compensate for the time lost in the ascents ? Will the

average rate of speed over the whole line be different? In either case the

load must manifestly be much smaller than the maximum which the engine
could draw on the level at a slow speed. The engine will therefore be able

to ascend the gradients of the undulating line merely by reducing its velocity,

and thus relieving itself from as much of the excess of resistance, which ex-
ists in addition to friction, as may be necessary to enable the power again to
equilibrate with the load. The inconvenience is only a reduction of speed
during the ascents, and of course a loss of time upon the ascending gradient,

as compared with the time that would have been occupied in conveying the

train over an equal length of level.
--266 REPORT 1841.

    Now, as by the hypotliesis the terminal points of the railway "are on a level
with each other, the sum of tlie descents must be equal to the sum of the

ascents. On the descents the force of gravity is brought into co-operation

with the power exerted by the engine, and a speed would hence result greater
than the speed which could be accomplished on the level. Although the
Committee were fully aware that resistance increased in a greater ratio than
speed, occasioning thereby some extra absorption of power on the descend-
ing gradients in making up for loss of time on the ascending ones, they were
nevertheless strongly impressed by the consideration of this principle of
compensation, and were of opinion that the loss of time on the whole
journey would be but trifling, provided the gradients were not very unfa-

vourable. To ascertain the value of this opinion, an experiment was made

with the Hecla engine, tender, and a train of twelve carriages, weighing al-
together 82 tons ; and every precaution was used to obtain accuracy in the

observation of velocity, consumption of fuel, and evaporation of water. The
line chosen was the Grand Junction and part of the Liverpool and Man-
chester Railway. The point of departure was Liverpool, and the train was
conveyed from thence to Birmingham and back, a total distance of 190 miles.
The point of termination of the journey was therefore Liverpool, the train

being brought again to the same level after traversing a long series of undu-

lations.

    The Table in the Appendix exhibits the time of passing the different
quarter mile-posts, taken by a stop watch ; also the variations in the inclina-
tions of the road ; the difference of time between the quarter mile-posts and
the average speeds, as well as the particulars of stoppages for coke and

water at the stations.
    Collecting into one table the uniform speeds observed, both in ascending

and descending the several gradients, and comparing the mean of these

speeds with the average speed actually accomplished on the level portion

(4 miles in length) northward of Crewe Station, we find an extraordinary
coincidence in the results. The uniform rate of speed on the level was
30'71 miles per hour on the up-journey, 31*15 miles per hour on the down-
journey ; and the mean of the two is 30*93 miles per hour.

Appendix a statement is given of the time occupied in performing the trips,
and of the time lost in stoppages, and in slackening and getting into speed
at the stations. The difference between the two shows the time which would
have been occupied if the train had started from Liverpool and Birmingham
at full speed, and travelled between those places without stopping. This
enables a comparison to be made between the mean speed on the level, and
the average speed maintained by the train from its departure from Liverpool

to its arrival at Liverpool again. An equal deduction for stoppages, and for

loss of time in getting up speed, would have been necessary, had the line of

road been level throughout.

The mean speed on the level was 30'93 miles per hour.

The  time  of performing     the  190  miles,  stoppages  and                                                                                                                          '

                                                               delays deducted,

Avas 6 hours, 26 minutes, 48 seconds.
   If the 190 miles of road had been perfectly level, the time of performing

the journey would have been (at the rate of 30'93 miles per hour) 6 hours,

8 minutes, 54 seconds.
   In ordinary practice an engine of the dimensions of the Hecla would re-

ceive assistance up the Sutton, Whiston, and Warrington Incline Planes (1
in 89, 1 in 96, and 1 in 80). In the instance before us this was not the case,
and the train had the disadvantage of encountering gradients not contem-

plated in our theory ; whereby its speed sustained a loss not only in the
ascents but in the descents also, when the power of the brake was applied to

check the velocity. Taking all these attendant circumstances into account,

we may conclude that the opinion entertained by the Committee was a cor-

rect one, viz. that trains whose weight bore an ascertainable relation to the
nature of the gradients they had to traverse, could be made to traverse those
gradients at an average speed equal to what the power of the engine could

have accomplished on the level : that, for instance, a train of twelve carriages,
representing the size of an ordinary train of passengers on the Grand Junc-
tion Railway, v/ould travel over the existing gradients of that railway (saving
perhaps the steeper ones of 1 in 96, &c. just alluded to) in as short a time as

if the line had been absolutely level.

   On some lines of road a train of twelve carriages may be a less, and on

others a greater, than the average load which the conditions of traffic de-
mand. The power of the engine (meaning by that term its evaporative as

well as its tractive power) would then vary accordingly ; or if the line were

not already formed, the maximum gradient would be determined with refer-

ence to some standard form of engine, and to the probable size of the trains.

In the account of the Hecla's performance a correct statement is given of

the fuel and water consumed on both trips. The average consumption of

fuel, it will be seen, amounted to the rate of 37 lbs. per mile, which is reckoned

on the entire quantity consumed during the day, including therefore all that

was used for raising steam in the morning, and for keeping steam up during

Wethe intervals of rest.    shall not attempt to make an estimate of the duty

done by the unit of coke or water in transporting the load, because there
were no means of ascertaining the blast-pipe resistance, which it is believed
formed a very considerable portion of the whole resistance the engine had to

overcome, and because also later improvements in the locomotive engine
have been introduced, which enable them to perform an equal duty with at

least one-third less fuel.

ON A CONSTANT INDICATOR FOR STEAM-ENGINES. 307

Report of a Committee appointed at the Tenth Meeting of the Associa-

   tion, on the Construction of a Constant Indicator for Steam-Engines.

   Members of the Committee, the Rev. Professor Moseley, M.A.,
   F.R.S., Eaton Hodgkinson, Esq., F.R.S., J. Enys, Esq.

A REGISTRATION of the work done by a steam-engine made at its piston, or

of the work done by the steam upon the piston, appears to offer important

practical advantages, as compared with any other method of registration, in

these respects ; that it is applicable to every possible variety in the circum-

stances under which the engine is made to operate, and that it is a registra-

tion of the work of the engine ahsolutely, and separated from all those uncer-

tain influences of friction, or other prejudicial I'esistances which intervene

between the piston and the working points of the machine to which it gives

motion ; influences which it is impossible to eliminate from a registration of

the work done at the working points, with certainty or accuracy.

In proof of the advantages which would result from any method of regi-

stration of the work, and therefore of the duty of steam-engines, could it be

made to assume this general character, it is sufficient to point to the history

of the Cornish pumping-engines. It is entirely from the registration of their

work (so easily made in respect to them by reason of the simple and constant

nature of that work), that has resulted that admirable knowledge of the

working properties of the steam-engine, which is so extensively diff"used

through the mining districts ; and to the same cause is entirely due (as a

consequence of this knowledge), that vast economy of power and fuel in the

working of the Cornish engines, which has so recently been brought under

the consideration of the Association.

If a method of registration equally (or even yet more) certain and easy of

application could be extended to the working of all engines, no matter how

--varied or how complicated, or how intermittent the nature of their operations

might be to the engines, for instance, which perform the varied and inter-

mittent labours of an engineer's workshop or a manufactorj^ or to the engine

--of a steam-boat giving by a method beyond the control or interference of

-- --the engineer, the ivork of the engine of such a boat during any given time
   a day, a week, or a month, and the duty which the engine does with each

bushel of coals, independently of her speed through the water, and of all

considerations dependent upon \\\eform of the boat, or the direction or force

--of the winds or currents, or of the tides it would at once become possible,

by recording and publishing the duty of each engine periodically, to intro-

duce precisely that competition of economy in power between the engineers

in factories and the engineers in steam-boats, which has been attended with

results of such advantage to the mining districts of Cornwall.

If, again, we conceive the work of each of the engines of a railway com'

pany to be made thus to register itself, and the amount thus registered to be

published under the form of a weekly or a monthly return, together with the

quantity of the coals consumed by each, it is evident that a competition

amongst the engineers would be the immediate result, and a consequent

Aeconomy to the company in the use of the fuel.  competition which

would probably lead to that scientific adjustment of the amount of tlie load

to the evaporating power of the engine and the speed of transit, which

adjustment is the true and the great secret of the economical working of a

line of railway. Passing over the use which the resident engineer of such a

line of railway might make of an indicator like this, to determine the condi-

tion of the rails, and the general working state of any portion of the line, by

                                          x2

throwing the indicator of a trial engine into gear at any such portion of the

line, and thus registering tlie amount of work necessary to carry the engine

over that particular portion of the line; passing too over the value of the

purely scientific data which would result from the extensive accumulation of

records such as these, the Committee are desirous more particularly to point

out the importance of the knowledge it might supply, not only as to the eco-

nomical loorking of marine engines, but as to their construction, and the build

or construction of steam-boats. In the existing state of our knowledge, it is

impossible to divide with certainty between the builder of the boat and the

builder of its engine, the responsibility which belongs to their several parts

Ain giving speed to it.  registration such as that here spoken of would,

however, at once make this division. It would determine the merits of the

engine independently of the properties of the boat, and the properties of the

boat separately from the merits of the engine.

There are other points of view in which the value of such a method of

registration, if by any means it might be attained, is perhaps equally ap-

parent ; enough, however, has been said to justify the Association in appoint-

ing a committee to inquire into the possibility of effecting such a registra-

tion, and placing at their disposal a grant of 100/. to cover the expense of

such trials as they might recommend to be made.

                                    Watt's Indicator.

   The only instrument at present used for determining the work done by the
steam on the piston of an engine, is that well known as the indicator of Watt.
Its insufficiency for the purpose of a registration, such as that the Committee

proposed to themselves, was at once apparent to them. It determines the
work only at a single stroke of the engine ; the desideratum was a registration
of the work continued to any number of strokes, and under such variations
of the resistance as should render the work done at any one stroke no cor-
rect representative of the work done at any other. The indicator of Watt
presents its registration of the work thus done at a single stroke, under the
form of a certain small area, bounded by a curved line, which is traced by a
pencil fixed to a small piston sustaining the pressure of steam from the
cylinder of the engine, and made by means of a spiral spring to deviate from
its position of repose by spaces which are directly proportional to the pres-
sures sustained ; the paper which receives the trace of the pencil receiving
meanwhile a lateral motion, constantly proportional to the motion of the pis-

ton itself.

   Were it not that the first objection, the want of continuity, was fatal to this

method of registration for the object proposed to the consideration of the
Committee, the great inaccuracies to which it is liable in the mechanical
tracing of the curve, and the geometrical determination of the area it bounds,
would have led them to seek for some more certain method of registration,
and one more easy of application, to place in the hands of the working

engineer.

   The labours of the Committee were with this view specially directed to the
application of a principle of dynamometrical admeasurement, first proposed by
M. Poncelet, the illustrious President of the Institute, described by him in his
work, entitled ' Mecanique Industrielle,' and in the work of M. Morin, ' De-
scription d'Appareils Dynamometriques' (published at Metz in 1838).

   This principle will be best understood by the example of an application

which M. Morin has made of it, to the construction of an instrument for re-

H Gbe made to move upon one another in the directions K and I. Two

springs shackled together at their extremitie.^, and represented in a subsequent

Gfigure, are severally inserted in the apertures  and H, and fixed there by

their middle points.

G HThe separation of the two in the direction I and K, supposes there-

Gfore a deflection of these springs. Tlie piece I is connected with the

H Kcarriage to be moved by means of the bolt I, and to the piece E  the

horses are attached by means of the shank K. Thus the pressure of traction is

transmitted from the horses to the carriage through the system of springs,

and by the well-known property of elastic bodies a separation is thus pro-

duced in these springs, which (so long as it does not exceed a certain limit) is

Dalways directly proportioned to the amount of this pressure. B represents

A La flat circular disc, and  a pulley or sheave, both fixed upon the same

vertical axis F C. The sheave A L receives its motion by means of a band

from a sheave revolving with the wheel of the carriage, so that the motion of

Athe circumference of L bears always a constant ratio to the space traversed

H KEby the carriage. To tlie piece  is attached (by means of a joint or

hinge) the box M, containing certain mechanism intended to register the

number of revolutions made by a certain wheel.

This wheel is represented at F; it rests by its edge upon the disc, its plane

is at right angles to the line of traction ; and its position on the box is such.

that when the carriage sustains no traction, and the springs suffer therefore

no deflection, it rests over the centre of the revolving disc B D.
   In this position of the wheel F it would evidently receive no motion from

the revolution of the disc B D, however fast that disc might revolve, whilst
in any other position between F and D, the wheel F would receive a motion

from the revolution of the disc, which motion (if the revolution of the disc

were uniform) would be directly proportioned to the distance of the wheel F

from the centre of the disc, that is, directly proportioned to the separation of

the springs, or to the force of the traction.

    Since then, if the revolutions of the disc were uniform, that is, if the mo-
tion of the carriage wei'e uniform during any exceedingly small time, the mo-
tion of the wheel F would vary as the force of traction, and that evidently,

if the force of traction were constant, the motion of the wheel F would vary

directly as the motion of the carriage during the same time, it follows (by a
well-known principle of variation), that if both the force of traction and the

motion of the carriage were variable, the motion of the wheel F would vary

as their product ; and this being true of every exceedingly small period of

the motion, it follows that the whole motion of the wheel F during any finite
time, however long, is proportional to the sum of the products obtained by

multiplying each elementary space described by the can-iage, by the parti-
cular force of traction under which that elementary space is described, or, in
other words, that the whole space moved over by the circumference of the

wheel F is directly proportional to the whole work, or dynamical effect ex-

pended in moving the carriage, however varied the traction or the velocity

may have been. It was to an application to the steam indicator of that ad-
mirable and fruitful principle of M. Poncelet, which combines the motions of

the Avheel F and the disc B D, and which, in fact, performs the complex ope-

--ration known in analysis as integration integrating the traction, considered
--as a function of the space that the attention of the Committee was specially

directed by the Association, and that their labours have particularly been de-

voted. The indicator which they have now the honour to present to the
Association has nothing in common with the instrument which has just been
described, except the principle of M. Poncelet and the springs of M. Morin

these have been constructed according to the formulse given bj'^ that gentle-

man in his work already quoted (Appareil Dynamometrique, <&rc.), and have

of the machine was given by Professor Moseley, and he being the only

member of the Committee resident in London, the execution of it was placed

under his direction.

    Theaccompanyingengraving(Plate VI.) represents the indicatorconstructed

Dby the Committee. C and are cylinders, each four inches in length, commu-
Anicating by the steam-pipes and B with the top and bottom of the cylinder

of the engine to which the indicator is applied, and well clothed with felt to
prevent radiation. In these cylinders work two solid pistons, each four

square inches in area, fixed upon the extremities of the same piston-rod E F,

Awhich piston-rod (when the steam passages and B are open and the indi-

cator is in action) sustains in the direction of its length a pressure equal to the

difference between the pressures upon the two pistons fixed upon its extre-
mities, or (since these sustain the same pressure with equal portions of the

opposite sides of the piston of the engine) equal to the effective pressure of the

steam on four square inches of the piston of the engine. This pressure upon
the piston-rod is made to bear, by means of a shoulder Z, upon the steel
ON A CONSTANT INDICATOR FOR STEAM-ENGINES. 311

spring S T, which spring is connected by means of links at its extremities with

Qa second similar and equal spring R, supported at its centre upon a solid

projection P, from the cast-iron frame of the instrument. The pressure of the

piston-rod upon the lower spring borne at the extremities of the upper spring,

whose centre is fixed, is thus made to separate the two springs from one another,

and the separation produced is, by a well-known law of deflection, directly

proportional to the pressure sustained, so long as the deflections are small. The

limits within which this law of deflection obtains, are greatly extended by the

peculiar form given to these springs, first suggested (it is believed) by M.

Morin. One surface of each spring is plane, and the opposite surface of that

well-known parabolic form by which an equal strength is given to every por-

tion of the length of the spring. The spring being thus tapered from its centre

to its extremities without impairing its strength, its deflection is distributed

more uniformly throughout its length*, and being thus made less (for a given

separation of the springs) at every point, the elastic limits are nowhere so

soon passed.

By this connexion of the piston-rod with the springs, its position is made

to vary directly as the eflTective pressure upon its extremities, or as the effec-

tive pressure upon four square inches of the piston of the engine, so that

every additional pound in that pressure will cause the piston-rod to alter its

position by the same additional distance in the direction of its length.

  KThe pulley or wheel I (which, from the peculiar functions assigned to

it in this machine, we propose to call the integrating wheel,) turns upon the

piston-rod as its axis, and traverses with it at the same time in the direction

of its length, being prevented from moving on it in that direction by means

of two shoulders fixed by adjustment screws.

The arms of this wheel are pierced by apertures, through which pass three

rods united at their extremities (as shown in the figure), so as to form the

Grigid frame H, which frame turns also upon the piston-rod as its axis, but
Kdoes not traverse with it in the direction of its length ; so that the wheel I

is made by its motion with the piston-rod to traverse the rods of the frame

longitudinally, whilst it is made to sweep the frame round with it by any

motion of rotation which may at the same time be communicated to it about

Kits axis. It receives such a motion of rotation from the cone L, which is

so placed that its side may be accurately parallel to the piston-rod, and which

Kis kept continually pressed against the wheel at  by means of a spiral

spring inclosed in a tube at M, and acting continually against the extremity

of the spindle on which the cone turns.

  A system of bevel wheels U, Y, X, communicates to this spindle, and with

it to the cone, the rotation of the pulley N, which pulley is driven by a cord

carrying a weight at one extremity, and passing by the other extremity (over

directing pulleys) to the piston of the engine, or to some point which moves

precisely as thepiston of the engine does, but through a less space. The circum-

Nference of the pulley being thus made to move precisely as the piston of the

engine, the angle described by the cone, during any exceedingly small period

of time, is made to be exactly proportional to the space described during that

time by the piston of the engine. Now let it be observed, that the circum-

Kference of the integrating wheel I partaking of the motion of that portion of

the surface of the cone with which it is at any instant in contact, the number

   * An absolute uniformiti/ of deflection throughout the length of the spring is not obtained
by the construction of M. Morin, but only a uniformity of strength ; the two objects are not
compatible. It would, perhaps, be more expedient for the use here given to the springs,

that, by a different but equally simple law ef the variation of their thickness, they should be
made to bend uniformly throughout.
312 REPORT-- 1841.

of revolutions, or rather parts of a revolution, which it is made to describe

during any exceedingly small period of time, beginning from that instant, is
dependent upon two causes ; first, upon the angle which the cone describes
about its axis during that small period of time, and secondly, upon the distance

Kof its point of contact with the cone from the apex of the cone at that time.

Moreover, that if either of these two elements of variation remained always
the same, then the number of revolutions, or parts of a revolution, made by
the wheel, would vary directly as tiie other, whence it follows, by a well-known
principle of variation, that when (as in the present case) both these elements
vary, it varies as their product ; or that the number of revolutions, or parts of
a revolution, made by the integrating wheel during any exceedingly small
period of time, varies directly as the product of two factors, of which one is
the angle described during that time by the cone, and the other the distance

Kof the point of contact of the cone and wheel from the apex of the cone.

   Now the former of these factors has been shown to vary directly as the

space described during that small period of time by the piston of the engine,
and the latter to vary directly as the effective pressure which the steam is
then exerting upon the piston of the engine*.

    Thus, then, it appears that the number of revolutions, or parts of a revolu-
tion, made during any exceedingly small period of time by the integrating
wheel, varies as the product of the space described by the piston of the engine
during that time, by the effective pressure of the steam upon it during that
time, that is, it varies as the work or dynamical effect of the steam upon the

piston during that time. And this being true in respect to every small pe-

riod of the time during which the stroke of the engine is in progress, is true
of the whole stroke; whence it follows, that the number of revolutions, and
parts of a revolution, made by the integrating wheel during the stroke is pro-
portional to the whole work, or dynamical effect of the steam upon the piston

during the stroke.

   GThe integrating wheel carries round with it the frame H, on the hollow

axis of which frame is fixed a pinion running into a wheel, whose axis turns
upon bearings fixed to the frame of the instrument, and the number of whose
teeth is to that of the teeth in the pinion as ten to one. This wheel carries
also a pinion running into a second wheel, their numbers of teeth being in
the same proportion, and so through a train of five wheels and pinions. The
circumference of each of the four last wheels is divided into ten equal parts
and numbered, and the circumference of the first into 100. The number of
revolutions of the integrating wheel is thus registered to five places of inte-

gers, and to one place of decimals.

   Now this number of revolutions has been shown to be proportional, in re-

spect to each stroke, to the work done by the steam upon the piston during
that stroke ; if therefore the action of the indicator continued the same during
successive strokes, or if the direction of the pressure of the steam upon the
piston, and that of the motion of the piston, were not reversed at every stroke,
then would the number registered during any number of strokes of the en-
 gine be directly proportional to the work done by the steam upon its piston
whilst that number was registered. At the return-stroke of the piston of the
 engine, the pulley N, however, revolves backwards, and supposing it to carry

    * The position of the integrating wheel upon the piston-rod is so adjusted, that before
 the steam is admitted the integrating wheel may be brought by the elasticity of the springs
 exactly to the apex of the cone. In order to prevent it fi'om being stopped by the apex of
 the cone, if accidentally it should be made to pass it, a solid piece projects from the frame of
 the instrument, having its surfaces adjusted so as to receive the edge of the wheel when it is
 forced beyond the apex of the cone, and to serve as a stop to the motion of the cone in the
 direction of its spindle when the resistance of the wheel is thus removed from it.
         ON A CONSTANT INDICATOR FOR STEAM-ENGINES. 313

with it the spindle of the cone, the cone also revolves backwards, so that if

the integrating wheel remain in contact with the cone at any other point than

its apex, it too will be made to revolve backwards, and the number registered in

the preceding stroke will thus be dimi7iished by the number of revolutions

made by the integrating wheel during this stroke : but let it be observed, that

before the motion of the piston of the engine is reversed, the direction of the

pressure of the steam upon it, and therefore the direction of the pressure

upon the piston-rod of the indicator, is reversed, by whicii altered direction

of the pressure, as well as by the elasticity of the springs, the integrating

wheel is made to ascend to the apex of the cone, and to remain there during
the return-stroke, so that no number whatever is registered during that

stroke.

Thus, then, the remaining number registered during any time by the in-

strument when applied to the double acting engine, is proportional to the

work done upon the piston by the steam at the alternate strokes during that

time. The mathematical formula by which the work is determined from this

number, and allowance made for the friction of the indicator, is given in a

subsequent part of this Report.

In order eifectually to guard against any error which might accidentally re-

sult from the reversed motion of the piston, a contrivance has been intro-

duced in the combination of wheels Y, X, U, by which the revolution of the

cone may be arrested whilst that reversed motion takes place. To adapt the

instrument to register (if required) the work done at every stroke of the piston,

a four-way cock has been constructed, which may be made, by the action of

the engine, to control the direction of the steam passages of the indicator, in

such a way that the upper cylinder C shall always communicate with that

portion of the cylinder of the engine which is filled with steam, whilst the

Dlower cylinder is made always to communicate with the vacuum. When

the indicator is thus used, the cone is made, by a simple adjustment of the

U Xmechanical combination  Y, to revolve constantly forwards, whilst the

motion of the piston of the engine, and therefore of the pulley N, alternates.

It remains now only to speak of the application of the indicator to the single

acting engine, or Cornish engine.

   The registration during the down or in-doors stroke of that engine is
already explained. During the first poi'tion of the up or out-of-doors stroke

the equilibrium valve is opened, and the pressure upon both the pistons of
the indicator thus becoming the same, the integrating wheel is brought by

the elasticity of the springs to its initial positron at the apex of the cone, and

thus, although the cone turns backwards, the wheel remains at rest and no-

thing is registered. When the equilibrium valve closes, the pressure of the

steam in the upper portion of the cylinder of the engine, and therefore in

the upper cylinder C of the indicator, preponderates ; the integrating wheel

descends from the apex of the cone and the register revolves backwards, de-
ducting from, or diminishing, the number before registered by precisely the
number of units of work which is done by the steam (jammed back into the

upper portion of the cylinder) against the returning piston. Now this is pre-

cisely the deduction which the theory of the steam-engine shows ought in this
case to be made, and the registration of each double stroke of the single acting
or Cornish engine is, by this backward movement of the integrating wheel,
perfected. Let it be here observed, that the indicator in the doion-sivokQ per-
forms the definite integration of a logarithmic function, viz. that A\hich repre-

sents the pressure of the steam as a function of space, described by the piston
during the expansion of the steam, that it then calculates the numerical
amount of the integral it has thus completed, and registers that amount
--314 REPORT 1841.

that it performs a similar operation in the up-stroke, and deducts the corre-

sponding amount as a correction from the first.

The above must be received as an attempt to place the theory of the in-

Astrument under a general and popular form.      mathematical discussion of

it accompanies this Report, in which the corrections due to friction and other

causes are fully considered.

The instrument will be observed to differ from that invented by M. Morin

for applying the same principle of M. Poncelet to estimate the traction of

carriages, as well in those contrivances which are specially required by its

application to the steam-engine, as in the following important particulars,

which are wholly independent of that particular application.

First, the surface of a cone is here substituted for the plane surface of a cir-

cular disc, an arrangement by which the rapidity of the changes of velocity

due to corresponding changes in the position of the integrating wheel is di-

minished in the same proportion in which the sine of one half the angle of the

cone is less than unity ; and the force necessary to drive the integrating wheel

is diminished in the same proportion, and therefore the chance of an error

arising from the slipping of the edge of the integrating wheel on the surface,

which gives it motion in the like proportion.

Secondly, it differs from the Compteur of M. Morin in the separation of

the registering apparatus from the integrating wheel, by the contrivance of

the frame and guides, by which separation, whilst the springs are relieved

from the effect of the momentum and the friction due to the weight of the re-

gistering apparatus, this last being brought to a state of quiescence, the re-

gistration is made legible whilst the indicator is in action.

sure remaining constant. Now this equation obtains, however small the

spaces may be taken which are represented by A L, through each of which

therefore if the spaces be taken infinitely small, or if each pressure be sup-

posed to remain constant only through an infinitely small space, or, which is

the same thing, if the pressure constantly vary, which is the actual case ; and

Nnumber Lis registered by the indicator, is shown by the ordinary counter,
Uand the number thus determined being multiplied by the number of square

inches in the piston of the engine, will give the whole work yielded by the steam.

  +The sign is to be taken according as the steam pressure P is in the act

of increasing or diminishing, or as the piston of the indicator is in the act of

yielding to the pressure of the steam upon it, or to the pressure of the springs ; or
according as the friction F, which is always opposed to the direction in which

it is moving, is acting in a direction opposite to the pressure of the steam

upon it or in the same direction. An ambiguity results, therefore, from the

introduction of this sign, which is got rid of in the case of ordinary or double

acting engines, by the consideration that in such engines the steam pressure

increases only during an exceedingly small period of time, whilst the steam-

valve is in the act of opening, during which small period of time the piston

of the engine remains at rest ; at the expiration of this time the distance of

the wheel from the apex of the cone is less, by reason of the friction ; the

positive sign is therefore to be taken Avhilst it remains at this distance, that

is, until the expansion begins. Throughout the rest of the stroke the steam

pressure diminishes, and the negative sign is to be taken. Thus, if the steam

be expanded p times, the correction for friction becomes

In the Cornish engines, when the down-stroke has been completed and the

equilibrium valve opened, the piston of the indicator is relieved of all pres-

sure, and the integrating wheel ascends to the apex of the cone, and remains

there as long as the valve remains open ; it ceases therefore to partake in the

revolution of the cone during that time, and no number is registered. The

closing of the equilibrium valve produces again an excess of pressure on the

superior surface of the piston of the engine and of the indicator, and the in-

tegrating wheel begins to descend from the apex of the cone, and to be car-

ried round by it in the opposite direction to its former revolution, this pres-

sure continually increasing until the stroke is completed ; the formula must

the apertures through which the piston-rod passes, which piece is intended to
be rigid, and to serve merely as an attachment to the elastic arms of the spring,
having been constructed (by a mistake of the workman) greatly too thin, and
the apertures in it of too large a diameter. These causes seem not only to
have affected the limits of the deflection of the spring, but (in some degree)

its elasticity.

Springs of different degrees of elasticity are required,

that the same, or nearly the same, deflection and play of the

pistons of the indicator may be obtained when it is applied

Ato engines working at different steam pressures.  move-

able link, represented in the accompanying figure, has, how-

ever, been applied to obtain the same deflection from the

same pair of springs under a comparatively small variation

in the pressure to which they are subjected. The two per-

manent links which unite the two springs of any system

are removed and replaced by two such moveable links,

which are clamped upon the springs by means of the screws

shown in the figure, at such distances from their extre-

mities, as may, by shortening the arms of the spring, I'educe

the deflection due to a given strain to the required limit.

If this removal of the link from the extremity of the spring
be, however, carried beyond two, or at the utmost three
inches, the increased rigidity of the shortened arm and other

causes, will begin to affect the elastic properties of the

springs towards the limits of their deflection.

             Friction op the Pistons, Integrating Wheel, &c.

   It will be observed that the entire amount of that friction F which affects

the registration of the instrument is due to two causes, of which the first is
that constant friction of the pistons which results from the precautions ne-
cessary to prevent the escape of the steam, and the second that which is
due to the pressure of the cone, which is of brass, upon the integrating
wheel acting in the direction of the axis of the cone, and produced by the
pressure of the spring upon the extremity of its spindle.

  --By this last pressure friction is produced, 1st, at the point of contact of

the integrating wheel with the cone, and 2ndly, at the point of contact of the
integrating wheel with the piston-rod upon which it turns, and which serves
it as an axis.

    Every precaution has been taken to diminish the friction which results
from these several causes. The pistons have been made hollow, as shown in

the accompanying figure. Each may be conceived to

be formed of a thin brass cylinder or tube, accurately
fitting to the cylinder of the indicator, when heated to the
temperature of the steam, and crossed in its centre by a
ligid diaphragm or plate, about one-fourth of an inch
thick, in which the piston-rod is fixed. That part of the
surface of the piston which immediately surrounds this solid plate is hollowed
into a groove, so that no rigid portion of the mass of the piston is brought
in contact with the interior of tlie cylinder of the indicator, and thus the pos-
sibility of the surfaces binding upon one another by the expansion of one of
them is avoided, and any uncertain influence on the results from this cause

guarded against. To draw off the water of condensation the diaphragm of
       ON A CONSTANT INDICATOR FOR STEAM-ENGINES. 321

this piston is pierced by a tube, which passes through the bottom of the

cylinder, and is closed by a cock placed in such a position that it may be

opened and the water drawn ofF without stopping the indicator. To ensure

a uniform lubrication, a grease-cock is inserted in the top of the cylinder.

To reduce to the utmost the friction which results from the pressure of the

spring on the spindle of the cone, the sensibility of the cone to the action of

the spring is rendered as great as possible by diminishing the bearing surface

of the spindle, and causing the spring (which is a spiral spring inclosed in

a tube) to press accurately on the centre of the extremity of the spindle.
These precautions being taken, an exceedingly sliglit pressure of the spring is
found to be sufficient to produce that friction between the integrating wheel

and the cone which is required to drive the registering apparatus. It was in

the correct transmission of the motion of the cone to the integrating wheel that

the greatest difficulties were predicted, and that the least have been found.

   The following expedient was applied to determine the whole amount of

the prejudicial friction.

The instrument being put into the same condition in every respect in which

it would be applied to the engine, was fixed firmly in an upright position,

and the bottom of the lower cylinder being taken off, a hook was attached to

the centre of the piston working in that cylinder. To this hook weights were

attached, increasing in the same order in which they were increased for the

separate trial of the same system of springs as was now placed in the instrument.

When each weight had thus been added, and the pistons brought to their cor-

responding positions in the cylinders and the integrating wheel to its corre-

sponding place upon the cone, the piston-rod, carrying with it the pistons and

integrating wheel, was gently depressed by the hand until the lowest position was

found at which it would rest, and in this position the separation of the springs

was accurately measured. The diflPerence between this separation and that

produced by loading with the same weight the same springs before they were

placed in the instrument, was seen to be due to two causes, first, to the weight

of the connected system of the pistons, piston-rod, and integrating wheel, all

of which weight (in this state of the equilibrium of the system bordering upon

motion upivards) was borne by the springs ; and secondly, it was due to the

friction, which in that particular position of the system' was opposed to its

motion upwards. Now the moveable system of the pistons, piston-rod, and

integrating wheel being accurately weighed, and the deflection of the springs

due to each pound having been before accurately determined, the deflection

due to the former cause was accurately known, and therefore that due to the

latter, i. e. to the friction. The deflection of the springs due to the friction of

the instrument in every position of the pistons being thus found, the mean

deflection due to this cause was known, and therefore the mean amount of this

Afriction.  series of experiments was thus made, with great care and accu-

racy, by Mr. Tininie, three of the springs being successively placed in the

Ainstruments, and the weights gradually added and gradually taken offl

slight variation was found in the friction in different positions of the piston,

its greatest amount being uniformly found in the lowest position. This dif-
ference may in some degree be due to a slight inaccuracy of workmanship

it is, however, no doubt, principally to be attributed to the fact, that a larger

portion of the circumference of the integrating wheel is brought in contact

with the surface of the cone in the lower than in the higher positions of the

former, and that by reason of the milled edge of the wheel ploughing slight

furrows* on the brass surface of the cone ; the friction of these two surfaces is

    * These furrows have been rendered so slight as to produce no sensible injury to the surface
of the cone, by increasing the sensibility of the spindle to the action of the spiral spring on

its extrcraitv,

made to deviate from the ordinary laws of friction, and to be proportional partly

to the pressure and partly to the extent of the surface of contact. The fol-

lowing are the tabular results of experiments made by Mr. Timme with

springs No. 1, No. 3, and No. 4.

Similar experiments will be repeated Avhen the indicator shall have been

for some time in operation, and when the cylinders are at the temperature of

the steam. From the peculiar construction of the pistons, it is not, however,

anticipated that there will be much difference in the results of these experi-

ments.

The values of U, obtained from the above formula, being multiplied by the
number of square inches in the surface of the piston of the engine, will give
the whole number of units of work yielded by it during the time of the ex-

periment.
    It will be observed, that no account is taken in these formula of the weight

(3 lbs. 0| oz.) of the pistons, the integrating wheel, and the rod to which these
are attached. The influence of this weight is, in fact, allowed for when, the
springs being placed in the indicator, and therefore loaded with it, and sus-
taining no other pressure, the integrating wheel is moved to such a position

upon the rod as that its circumference may coincide with the apex of the
cone. The springs are then just so much deflected as by their elasticity to

sustain this weight, and that initial deflection remaining superadded to any

additional deflection to which they may be subjected by the additional strain

thrown upon them, the weight of the pistons, &c. will in every position be
accurately balanced by it, and the additional strain thrown upon the springs
will produce precisely the same deflections as though no such weight existed.

   In conclusion, the Committee are desirous to express their obligations to
Mr. Button, foreman to Mr. Fairbairn at Manchester, for a valuable sugges-
tion made by him, and adopted by them* ; to Mr. Holtzappfel for the excel-
lent workmanship of the machine ; and to include in this acknowledgement
their sense of the valuable services of his di-aughtsman, Mr. Timme, whose
name is several times mentioned in this Report, and whose intelligent and
persevering attention have greatly facilitated its construction.

   They regret that the construction of the instrument has been attended by
numerous delays, and that it has not been so far completed as to admit of
being applied to an engine for a trial until within one week of the date of
this Report. By the kindness of Messrs. Fairbairn and Murray they were then
allowed to place it on their engine at Mill-wall. The object of that trial
was simply to determine whether the mechanical difficulties opposed to its
construction, on which much stress had been laid, and in res'ject to which
a failure had been pi-edicted, had in reality been overcome ; on this point
the trial supplied a decisive answer. Every part of the instrument performed
the mechanical functions assigned to it with entire precision and accuracy,
except the pistons, which have been replaced by others more accurately fitted

to the cylinders.

    * It was at the suggestion of Mr. Dutton that a single cylinder was replaced by two
cylinders ; the instrument was thus made to assume a more compact and convenient form,
and much was gained, practically, in that correctness and facility of workmanship which re-
sults from making the cylinders themselves the guides of the piston-rod, and dispensing with
the stuffing-boxes.

   It remains now to the Committee to apply the indicator to some of the
engines whose work is registered by other means, and to compare the results
of the two registrations. They are induced to hope that at the next meeting

of the Association they shall be enabled to lay before it a considerable ac-
cumulation of results obtained by trials of the instrument under a variety
of different circumstances, and, in the confidence of the principles on which
its construction is founded and of these results, to present it to the Associa-
tion as a permanent indicator registering with certainty the work done upon
the piston of a steam-engine under every circumstance of motion and effort.

Report of the Committee on the Forms of Vessels. By J. S. Russell.

Mr. Scott Russell reported the progress made by "the Committee on Forms

of Vessels" during the past year. The object of the experiments is twofold ;
to advance our knowledge of the laws of resistance of fluids, and to obtain

data for the practical improvement of the art of naval construction.

   Many and expensive are the experiments formerly made on this subject.

Unfortunately these experiments have been made with imperfect apparatus,

or under circumstances different from the conditions of bodies moving on the

surface of the water, or on solids of a form unsuitable to the formation of

ships, or on so small a scale as to render them unworthy of the confidence of

the practical constructor. In the present series of experiments a more simple

apparatus was employed than on any foi'mer occasion. The forms of body

experimented upon were those of actual ships, or bodies analogous to those

in use ; it being the object of the experiments to supply the actual desi-

derata of hydrodynamics and of practical ship-building. The experiments

were made on vessels of every size, from models of 30 inches in length to

vessels of 1300 tons. The experiments were also made upon vessels in water

of variable depth, and in channels of various dimensions, so as, if possible, to

Aembrace all the elements of the resistance.  minute description of some of

the apparatus was then given along with some general illustrations ; but as the

experiments were still in progress, and to be continued during the following

year, no general statement of results was entered into. It was expected that

by next meeting the whole would be concluded.

        Report of the Committee on Waves. By J. S. Russell.
At the last meeting some discussions had taken place, tending to show the

value of an accurate determination of the velocity of the great wave of trans-
--326 REPORT 1841.

lation in a channel of trian^ilar section. Some other subjects, demanding
additional experiments, had also occurred to Mr. Russell since last meeting, and

an apparatus capable of generating large waves in a large triangular channel

had been constructed. The point to be determined, regarding the velocity of

--the great primary wave in the channel of triangular section, was this, whether

the velocity were that which is due by gravity to a depth of one-fourth part
of the depth of the channel, or of one-third. The difficulty of this determi-
nation arises from several causes : first of all, the wave in the triangular sec-
tion had a less continuous form than in the I'ectangular channel ; and, se-
condly, the portion of fluid in the angle of the channel at the bottom does not
acquire the same motion of translation with the remainder of the fluid in the
wider parts of the channel. These causes tend to retard the motion, and to
render it matter of doubt whether the actual velocity approaches nearer to

that due to one-third or one-fourth of the depth. An example of the results

obtained by experiment is as follows :

The velocity due to one-third of the depth being ... 6-5 feet per sec.

The velocity due to one-fourth of the depth being... 5-7 feet per sec.

The velocity observed by experiment was  6'3 feet per sec.

The general conclusion being, that the velocity of the great primary wave of

translation in a triangular channel is nearly that due to one-third of the depth,

making allowance for the resistance of the small portion in the angle of the

bottom, the result being nearer to the velocity due to one-third than to one-

fourth of the depth. The next point investigated was a curious phaenomenon

to which Mr. Russell had given the designation of the " great negative wave."

This phenomenon was in some respects the counterpart of the great wave of

translation. It has this curious property, that instead of being propagated

across other waves as the common oscillatory waves are, both in their posi-

tive and negative portions, this negative wave and the positive wave, when

meeting, had the effect of neutralizing each other so perfectly, as altogether

to leave the fluid in a state of rest, with the exception only of certain residual

oscillatory waves of the second order. With this wave a number of curious

phaenomena were associated, and it appeared to form an important element in

the resistance of fluids to the posterior portion of a ship, while the positive

Awave was closely associated with the resistance to the anterior part.  series

of experiments had also been made on a point which had not previously been

--examined, the influence of the velocity of the wave on the resistance of a

fluid to bodies moving with velocities remote from the velocity of the wave

whether, when a body moves with a given velocity less than that of the wave,

it will be more or less resisted according as the velocity of the wave is more

remote or less remote from its own ; and whether, when a body moves with a
given velocity greater than that of the wave, it will experience more or less re-

sistance, according as the velocity of the wave is more or less remote from its

own. The general result is, that with velocities less than that of the wave,

the resistance increases in a certain manner as the velocity of the wave dimi-

nishes, and that in velocities greater than that of the wave, the resistance di-

minishes as the velocity of the wave diminishes. Slowness of motion of the

wave, while it is least favourable to low velocities, is most favourable to high

velocities ; hence rectangular canals are best for low velocities, and sloping

sides for high velocities.

Report by the Committee to the British Association for the Advance-
   ment of Science, appointed to superintend the Engraving of Skeleton

   Maps for recording the Distribution of Plants and Animals.

Your Committee, to whom an additional grant of 251. was entrusted last

year for the above purpose, beg to report that as yet only a small part of
that grant has been applied, and they do not therefore require to draw for
any sum till next year, by which time they expect to see the maps, already

engraved, applied jorac&a% for carrying out the object in view.
   To explain why this has not been already done, they may state that Mr.

Brand (one of their number), to whom, as before, the execution of the design
was principally committed, and who last year had sent copies of the maps,
with documents illustrative of their application (as proposed by the Botanical
Society of Edinburgh), to various scientific gentlemen, whose opinion it was
thought desirable to obtain before circulating them more extensively, has
been since that time in communication with several of those gentlemen,

from whom he has received useful suggestions, although on a few points

their views do not entirely coincide. Effect has already been given to some
objections stated by them, and others have been removed by satisfactory ex-
planations ; so that now there are no important differences remaining. Mr.
Brand is thei-efore prepared immediately to recommence his labours, by re-
vising carefully the whole details, and making such improvements as the sug-
gestions transmitted to him and his own more mature opinions shall dictate.

   When this revision shall have been completed, the maps, &c. will be again

laid before the other members of the Committee for their final sanction, and
thereafter it is proposed to transmit copies of the whole to scientific gentle-
men both at home and abroad, partly with the view of disseminating, as
Avidely as possible, a knowledge of the scheme, and partly to obtain further ob-
servations from competent parties, before any great progress has been made

in its application for the intended purposes.
    In the meantime a copy of the maps, and illustrative documents above

mentioned, as they now stand, are sent herewith, and a further impression of
both has been thrown off, and forwarded to Plymouth for distribution among
such members of the Association as may take an interest in this subject ; so
that the Committee hope soon to be prepared with a more particular state-
ment of their proceedings, as well as of the advantages which may be expected

to result from this design itself, so liberally encouraged by the Association.
    They therefore beg leave to propose that the grant, voted in September

last, be continued till next annual meeting.

Report of the Astronomer Royal on the publication of the Hourly
   Observations made at Plymouth, under the superintendence of

   Mr. W. S. Harris.

1. The first series of observations of the thermometer extends from May

1832, to December 1836, containing readings of the thermometer for every

hour of the day and night. The means of the readings are taken for each

--day ; and for each hour the means for groups of ten or eleven days are taken.
   2. The second series of observations of the thermometer extends from

January 1837 to December 1839, and contains readings of the wet and

dry thermometer for every hour of the day and night. The means of the

--readings are taken for each day. 3. The observations of the barometer

extend from January 1837 to December 1839, and contain readings of

the barometer and attached thermometer for every hour of the day and night.

The means are taken for each day.

I am not aware that there exists any such collection of regular, consecutive,

and uniform observations. But I must beg that this, my statement, be re-

amceived with caution, for the two following reasons : first, that I  little

acquainted with the current literature of Meteorology ; secondly, that I

know nothing whatever of Mr. Harris's instruments, and especially, that I

have no assurance either of the identity of the instruments through the

series, or of the verification of their zero points ; two matters of capital im-

portance. Assuming, however, that the instruments have been the same,

and properly verified, I have no hesitation in recommending that the obser-

vations be printed in full. And (considering that many of the purposes to

which they may at future times be applied are yet unknown) I do not see

that any further deduction should be drawn, in the printed arrangement,

than is drawn by Mr. Harris, except that I would submit for Mr. Harris's

consideration, whether the means of the observations of several days, at the

same hour, should not be taken for the second and third series, in the same

manner as for the first.           G. B. Airy.

Report 071 the Hourly Observations at Inverness and Uist.

In conformity with the wishes of the British Association, the Hourly Ob-
servations at Inverness were recommenced on the 1st of November 1840;
but a difficulty presented itself to their renewal at Kingussie, which it was

not easy to overcome.

   Under these circumstances, I felt that I should promote in the most effec-
tual manner the objects which the Association contemplated, by transferring
the observations to a more northern locality ; and, with the assistance of Dr.
Fleming, I succeeded in establishing them at Balta Sound in Unst, the most

northern of the Shetland Islands, already distinguished in the history of science

by the astronomical observations made there in 1817 and 1818 by M. Biot

and Captain Kater.

Dr. Edmonston of Buness, whose love of science induced him to enter

warmly into the views of the Association, undertook to superintend the ob-

servations, which were begun early in the present year.

   The island of Unst being situated in lat. 60° 40', Leith in lat. 55° 58', and
Plymouth in lat. 50° 22', and all of them nearly in the same meridian, we

shall now obtain a series of hourly observations of peculiar value, from their

being made at the extremities and the middle of an arch of the meridian of

more than ten degrees.                                     D. Brewster,

Report on the Erection of an Osier's Anemometer at Inverness.

The Anemometer constructed by Mr. Osier for Inverness, though ready for

use, has not yet been erected, in consequence of an unexpected difficulty in

finding a suitable building.
   It was at first proposed to erect it on the roof of Raining's school, where

the hourly meteorological observations are made by Mr. Mackenzie ; but the
roof of this building was not considered strong enough for thf; purpose, and

other difficulties prevented this arrangement from being carried into effect.

The observatory of Inverness was unfortunately in the act of being trans-

ferred from one body of proprietors to another, otherwise the anemometer

would have been erected on its summit ; but I am informed by Mr. Macken-

zie that the transaction is nearly completed, and that the Committee of the

Mechanics' Institute, to whom it now belongs, will cheerfully devote a part

of it for the reception of the anemometer.                 D. Brewster.

and fluid media, I have been led to positive and interesting results.

In order to obtain additional accuracy of observation, particularly near the

extremities of the spectrum, Mr. Dollond has constructed for me some im-

portant pieces of apparatus for directing and condensing the solar rays ; and

I have recently obtained from Mr. Merz of Munich, a yery large prism, to

be used vi'ith the telescope, and a series of smaller prisms for constructing a

The Committee appointed to superintend the reduction of the stars in tJte

         Histoire Celeste, report

    That, at the last meeting of the British Association, they stated that it

would cost about 200/. more than the sum then expended, to complete the
whole of the reductions. That some error appears to have taken place in
the amount of the grant, as only 150Z. was appropriated, of which 135/. has
now been expended, thus leaving 15/. in hand. The Committee, therefore,
again suggest the propriety of extending the grant, this year, to (551., which

will complete the original estimate for the whole of the reductions, and which
can thus be finished before the next meeting of the Association.

                                                                                   Francis Baily.

The Committee appointed to superintend the extension of stars in the Ttoyal

That no delay has taken place in prosecuting the work, and that it is ex-

pected to be completed in a short time. That 40/. has been expended out

of the 150/. granted at the last meeting of the British Association ; and con-

sequently that there is 110/. still in abeyance, which the Committee request

may be continued till the completion of the work, in order to meet any

contingent expenses.                                    Francis Baily.

I HAVE received from the Treasurer 51. of the grant, of which I have ex-

])ended about 1/. in commencing the inquiry ; but owing to the construction
of a coffer dam, and other obstructions in the river at Belfast, preparatory to
the erection of a new bridge, I have not yet been able to obtain any result
which would be worth communicating to the Association. If, however, the

grant be renewed, I shall continue my inquiries vigorously after my return

to Belfast, during the autumn and winter.
   Nothing has been done by the other members of the Committee, as I retain

possession of the vessel which we use for raising the water.

Report of the Committee on Marine Zoology.

They have expended in dredging on the coast of the county of Antrim the
sum of 255., but were obliged, by the tempestuous state of the weather and

other causes, to suspend further operations. They recommend that a re-

newal of the grant of 50/. be applied for.  Robert Patterson,

   Sir W. Jardine, on behalf of the Committee appointed to take steps for in-

creasing our knowledge of the Anoplura Britanni(B, reported that by the
encouragement afforded by the Committee to Mr. Denny, who has been long

been enabled to make arrangements for the speedy publication of a work on
the subject, illustrated with coloured plates, twenty-one of which have been

submitted to the inspection of the Committee.

   Dr. Buckland, on behalf of a Committee who were instructed to take steps
for augmenting our knowledge of the fossil fishes of the Old Red Sandstone
of Great Britain, states, that owing to the severe illness of M. Agassiz, whose

Varieties of Human Race.

Queries respecting the Human Race, to be addressed to Travellers and
   others. Drawn up by a Committee of the British Association for

   the Advancement of Science, appointed hi 1839.

[Referred to present vol. of Reports, p. 52.]

At the meeting of the British Association held at Birmingham, Dr. Prichard
read a paper " On the Extinction of some varieties of tlie Human Race."
He pointed out instances in which this extinction had ah-eady taken place

to a great extent, and showed that many races now existing are lilcely, at no

Hedistant period, to be annihilated.  pointed out the irretrievable loss

which science must sustain, if so large a portion of the human race, count-

ing by tribes instead of individuals, is suffered to perish, before many in-

teresting questions of a psychological, physiological and philological charac-

ter, as well as many historical facts in relation to them, have been investi-
gated. Whence he argued that science, as well as humanity, is interested

in the efforts which are made to rescue them, and to preserve from oblivion

many important details connected with them.

At the suggestion of the Natural Historical Section, to which Dr. Prich-

ard's paper was read, the Association voted the sum of £5 to be expended in

printing a set of queries to be addressed to those who may travel or reside

Ain parts of the globe inhabited by the threatened races.    Committee

was likewise appointed by the same Section to prepare a list of such questions.

The following pages, to which the attention of travellers and others is ear-

nestly invited, have, in consequence, been produced. It is right to observe,

that whilst these questions have been in preparation, the Ethnographical

Society of Paris has printed a set of questions on the same subject for the

use of travellers. It has been gratifying to perceive the general similarity

between the questions proposed by the French savans who compose that So-

ciety, and those which had been already prepared by the Committee ; but

the Committee is bound to acknowledge the assistance which, in the com-

pletion of its task, it has derived from the comprehensive character and ge-

neral arrangement of the Ethnographical Society's list. The following queries

might have been considerably extended, and much might have been added

to explain the reasons and motives on which some of them are founded.

Such additions would, however, have inconveniently extended these pages,

and, in part, have defeated their object. The Committee has only further

to express its desii'e that the Association may continue its support to the in-

teresting subject of Ethnography, and tliat their fellow-members will aid in

bringing these queries under the notice of those who may have it in their

power to obtain replies. Britain, in her extensive colonial possessions and

commerce, and in the number and intelligence of her naval officers, possesses

unrivalled facilities for the elucidation of the whole subject ; and it would

be a stain on her character, as well as a loss to humanity, were she to allow

herself to be left behind by other nations in this inquiry.

    It will be desirable, before giving direct answers to the questions proposed

in the following list, that the traveller should offer, in his own terms, a de-
scription of the particular group of human beings, which he may have in
view in drawing up his list of answers, seeing that the replies, however accu-
rate and replete with useful information, may fail in some particulars to give

--a complete idea of the people to whom they relate.
   Physical Characters. 1. State the general stature of the people, and con-

firm this by some actual measurements. Measurement may be applied to
                            PROVISIONAL REPORTS AND NOTICES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    333

absolute height, and also to jDroportions, to be referred to in subsequent

queries. The weight of individuals, when ascertainable, and extreme cases,

as well as the average, will be interesting. What may be the relative differ-

ences in stature and dimensions, between males and females ?

2. Is there any prevailing disproportion between different parts of the

body ? as, for example, in the size of the head, the deficient or excessive de-

velopment of upper or lower extremities.

3. What is the prevailing complexion ? This should be accurately de-

fined, if possible, by illustrative and intelligent example, such as by compa-

rison Avith those whose colour is well known. The colour of the hair

should be stated, and its character, whether fine or coarse, straight, curled,

or woolly. The colour and character of the eyes should likewise be described.

Is there, independently of want of cleanliness, any perceptible peculiarity of

odour ?

4. The head is so important as distinctive of race, that particular attention

must be paid to it. Is it round or elongated in either direction, and what is

the shape of the face, broad, oval, lozenge-shaped, or of any other marked

form ? It will contribute to facilitate the understanding of other descriptions,

Ato have sketches of several typical specimens.                          profile, and also a front

view should be given. In the profile, particularly notice the height and angle

of the forehead, the situation of the meatus auditorius, and the form of the

posterior part of the head. It will also be desirable to depict the external

ear, so as to convey the form and proportion of its several parts. The form
of the head may be minutely and accurately described by employing the di-

visions and terms introduced by craniologists, and the corresponding de-

velopment of moral and intellectual character should in conjunction be faith-

fully stated. So much of the neck should be given with the profile as to

show the setting on of the head. The advance or i-ecession of the chin, and
the character of the lips and nose, may likewise be given in profile. The

front view should exhibit the width of forehead, temples, and cheek-bones,

the direction of the eyes, and the width between them : the dimensions of

the mouth. When skulls can be collected or examined, it would be desira-

ble to give a view in another direction, which may even be done, though

with less accuracy, from the living subject. It should be taken by looking
down upon the head from above, so as to give an idea of the contour of the

forehead, and the width of the skull across from one parietal protuberance

to the other.

5. State whether the bones of the skull are thick, thin, heavy, or light.

Is it common to find the frontal bone divided by a middle suture or not ?

Note the form of the outer orbitar process, which sometimes forms part of a

Howbroad scalene triangle, with the vertex downwards.                    are the frontal

sinuses developed ? Observe whether the ossa triquetra are frequent, or
otherwise ; whether there be frequent separation of the upper part of the os

occipitis ; the relative situation of the foramen magnum. In regard to the

bones of the face, notice the position   of the ossa  nasi and           unguis                                the  former
                                                                                                            ;

sometimes meet nearly or quite on the same plane, whilst, in others, they

meet at an angle. The former character is strongly marked in many African

skulls. State the form of the jaw bone, shape of the chin, and observe the

angle of the jaw, the position and character of the teeth, and their mode of

wear                        and if they  have any practice of modifying  their form or appearance,
                         ;

let this be stated. The malar bones have already been noticed, but they may

require a more minute description.

6. When the opportunity can be found, observe the number of lumbar

vertebra?, since an additional one is said to be common in some tribes.

7.  Give the length of tliQ sternum as compared with the whole trunk                                                                                                                                                                                                                            and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;
334 REPORT--1841.

also some idea of the relative proportion between the chest and the ab-
domen.

   8. What is the character of the pelvis in both sexes, and what is the form

 of the foot ?

    9. The form of the scapula will also deserve attention, more especially as

regards its breadth and strength ; and the strength or weakness of the clavicle
 should be noticed in connexion with it.

    10. The internal organs, and blood-vessels, will with greater difficulty be
subjected to examination ; but it may be well here to remark, that varieties

--in these may prevail locally in connexion with race.
    N.B. Peculiarities may exist, which cannot be anticipated in queries,

but which the observer will do well to notice amongst his answers to ana-

tomical questions.

    11. Where a district obviously possesses two or more varieties of the
human race, note the typical characters of each in their most distinct form,
and indicate to what known groups or families they may belong : give some

idea of the proportion of each, and state the result of their intermixture on

physical and moral character. When it can be ascertained, state how long

intermixture has existed, and of which the physical characters tend to pre-

dominate. It is to be observed, that this question does not so much refer to

the numerical strength or political ascendency of any of the types, but to the

greater or less physical resemblance which the offspring may bear to the
parents, and what are the characters which they may appear to derive from
each : whether there is a marked difference arising from the father or the

mother belonging to one of the types in preference to another ; also whether
the mixed form resulting from such intermarriage is known to possess a per-
manent character, or after a certain number of generations to incline to one or
other of its component types.

   12. Any observation connected with these intermarriages, relating to

health, longevity, physical and intellectual character, will be particularly in-
teresting, as bringing light on a field hitherto but little systematically inves-
tigated. Even when the people appear to be nearly or quite free from in-
termixture, their habits, in respect of intermarriage within larger or smaller
circles, and the corresponding physical characters of the people, will be very

--interesting.
   Language. 13. Do the natives speak a language already known to philo-

logists, and if so, state what it is ; and notice whether it exhibit any dialec-
tic peculiarities, as well as the modifications of pronunciation and accentua-

tion which it may offer. State also the extent to which this dialect may be

used, if limits can be ascertained.

    14. If the language be little if at all known, endeavour to obtain a vocabu-
lary as extensive as circumstances will allow, and at least consisting of the

numerals, the most common and important substantives*, the pronouns in all

persons and numbers, adjectives expressive of the commonest qualities, and,
if possible, a few verbs varied in time and person. The vocabulary should
be tested by the interrogation of different natives, and more than one person
should be engaged in taking it down from their mouths, to avoid, as far as
may be, errors arising from peculiarities of utterance or defect of hearing.
It is likewise of importance that the system of orthography be duly indicated
and strictly adhered to.

   15. Endeavour to take down some piece of native composition, such as

the ordinary phrases employed in conversation, and any other piece of prose

which may be attainable ; and specimens of metrical composition if such
exist. Though these would be of comparatively little use without transla-

                          * The names of mountains, lakes, rivers, islands, &c.

tion, j'et independently of this some importance is to be attached to the me-

trical compositions if they have a national character and are widely diffused;

and, in this case, it might be possible to express some of their airs in musical

Acharacters. specimen of known composition translated into their language,

may also be given, such as the first chapter of Genesis, the fifteenth chapter

of Luke's Gospel, and the Lord's Prayer.

16. Endeavour to ascertain whether the language is extensively spoken or

understood, and whether there are different languages spoken by men having

similar physical characters obviously connecting them as a race, or if differ-

ing somewhat in this respect, inhabiting a particular geographical tract.

When such groups are said to possess different languages, endeavour, as far

as possible, to ascertain their number, the sources whence each is derived,

and the languages to which it is allied ; and also the circumstances, geogra-

phical or political, which may account for these distinctions.

reference is made to a short essay on this subject read to the Philological

--Society of London.]

to flatten the occiput, as amongst most Americans, by the flat straight board

to which the child is attached ; to occasion the lateral distortion of the

head, by allowing it to remain too long in one position on the hand of the

   51. Have any monuments been raised by the present inhabitants or their

predecessors, and more especially such as relate to religion or war ? State
their character, materials, and construction. If they are still in use amongst

the people, state this object, even if they should be of the simplest construc-

tion, and be little more than mounds or tumuli. If these monuments are no

longer in use, collect, as far as possible, the ideas and traditions of the na-

tives regarding them, and, if possible, have them examined by excavation or

otherwise, taking care to deface and disturb them as little as possible.

   52. In these researches be on the look out for the remains of the skeletons

of man or other animals, and, if discovered, let them be preserved for com-

parison with those still in existence.

    Works of Art 53. Let works of art, in metal, bone, or other materials,
be likewise sought and preserved, and their similarity to, or difference from

implements at present in use amongst the people of the district, or elsewhere,

be noted.

   54. When a people display their ingenuity by the extent or variety of their -

works of art, it will not only be desirable to describe what these are, but also

the materials of which thej^ are constructed, the modes in which these
materials are obtained, the preparation which they undergo when any is re-

quired, and the instruments by which they are wrought. Such particulars

will not only throw light on the character and origin of the people, but will,

directly or indirectly, influence the commercial relations which may be pro-

fitably entei-ed into when commerce alone is looked to. When colonization

is contemplated, the facts contained in the replies to these queries will point

out the mntual advantages which might be obtained by preserving, instead of

annihilating, the aboriginal population.

 --Domestic Animals. Are there any domestic animals in the possession of

the people ? Of what species are they ? Whence do they appear to have
been derived, and to what variety do they belong? Have they degenerated

--or become otherwise modified ? To what uses are they applied ?
    Government and Laws. 55. What is the form of government ? Does it

assume a monarchical or democratic character, or does it rest with the priests ?

56. Are the chiefs, whether of limited or absolute power, elective or here-

ditary ?

57. Is there any division of clans or castes ?

58. What are the privileges enjoyed by or withheld from these ?
59. What care is taken to keep them distinct, and with what effect on the

physical and moral character of each ?

  60. What laws exist among the people ? How are they pi'escrved ? Are

they generally known, or confided to tlie memory of a chosen set of persons ?

Wliat are their opinions and regulations in reference to property, and espe-
cially the occupation and possession of the soil ? Does the practice of hiring

labourers exist among them ?

   61. Have they any knowledge or tradition of a legislator, to whom the

formation of laws is ascribed ?

  62. Do they rescind, add to, or modify their laws ? and how ?

   63. Are they careful in the observance of them ?

   64. What are tiicir modes of enfo;:'cing obedience, and of proving and

punishing delinquency ?

   Geography and Statistics 68. Briefly state the geographical limits and

character of the region inhabited by the people to whom the replies relate.
   69. State approximatively the number of inhabitants. As this is an im-

portant, but very difficult question, it may not be amiss to point out the modes
in which the numbers may be ascertained. The people themselves may state
their number with more or less accuracy, but it should be known whether
they refer to all ranks and ages, or merely comprehend adult males, who may

be mustered for war, or other general purpose requiring their combination. In

this case state the apparent proportion between adult males and other mem-
bers of families. The number of habitations in a particular settlement may be
counted, and some idea of the average numbers of a family be given. Where

the people inhabit the water-side, the number and dimensions of their craft
may be taken, and some idea of the proportion between the number of these

and of the individuals belonging to them, may be formed. In drawing con-

clusions from observations of this kind, it will be necessary to have due re-

gard to the different degrees of density or rarity in which, from various

causes, population may be placed.

70. Has the number of inhabitants sensibly varied, and within what period ?

   71. If it have diminished, state the causes; such as sickness, starvation,

war, and emigration. When these causes require explanation, please to give

it. If the inhabitants are on the increase, is this the result of the easy and

favourable circumstances of the people causing an excess of births over

deaths ; or is it to be assigned to any cause tending to bring accessions from

other quarters ? State whether such causes are of long standing, or recent.

72. Is the population generally living in a manner to which they have been

long accustomed, or have new relations with other people, and consequently

new customs and practices, been introduced ?

73. If the people, being uncivilized, have come under the influence of the

civilized, state to what people the latter belong, how they are regarded, and

what is the kind of influence they are producing*. State the points of their

good influence, if any, and those of an opposite character, as the introduction

of diseases, vices, wars, want of independence, <ic.

74. Is there any tendency to the union of races ? how is it exhibited, and

--to what extent ?
    Social Relations. 75. What kind of relationship, by written treaty or

otherwise, subsists between the nation and other nations, civilized or not ?

Have they any intercourse by sea with other countries ? Do any of them

understand any European language ? Or are there interpreters, by whom they

can communicate with them ?

76. Are they peaceable, or addicted to war? Have they any forms of de-

claring war, or making peace ? What is their mode of warfare, either by

sea or land ? their weapons and strategy ? What do they do with the slain,

and with prisoners ? Have they any mode of commemorating victories by

monuments, hieroglyphics, or preservation of individual trophies, and of

what kind ? Have they any national poems, sages, or traditions respecting

their origin and history ?   Where Europeans  have        introduced  fire-arms, as-

offer sacrifices, and are they of an expiatory character, or mere gifts ?
   80. Have they any sacred days or periods ? fixed or moveable feasts, or

religious ceremonies of any kind, or any form of thanksgiving or other

observance connected with seasons ?

   81. Have they any order of priests, and if so, are they hereditary, elective,

or determined by any particular circumstance?

   82. Is the religion of the people similar to that of any other people, neigh-
bouring or remote ? If different, are they widely so, or dependent on parti-
cular modifications, and of what kind ?

83. In what light do they regard the religion and deities of neighbouring

tribes ?

--84. Is there any idea of an inferior order of spirits and imaginary beings,
   such as ghosts, fairies, brownies, and goblins ; and how are they described ?
   85. Have they any notions of magic, witchcraft, or second sight ?
   86. What ideas are entertained respecting the heavenly bodies ? Have
they any distinction of stars, or constellations ? and if so, what names do
they give them, and what do these names signify ?

   87. Are they in any manner observed with reference to the division of the
year, and how ?

88. If time is not divided by observations of those bodies, what other mode

is adopted ? and do observances connected with them rest with the priests or

chiefs ?

89. When the traveller, by personal acquaintance with the language, or by

means of competent assistance from interpreters, can freely converse with the

people, it will be desirable that he should form some idea of their amount of

intelligence, their tone of mind with regard to social relations, as respects

freedom, independence, or subserviency, and their recognition of moral ob-

ligations, and any other psychological character which observation may de-

tect                 and  more  especially  such  as  may contribute  to  an  estimation  of the

Observations made at the Magnetic Observatory at Toronto, during a
   remarkable Magnetic Disturbance on the 25th and 26th of Septem-
   ber, 1841 ; with Postscripts, containing the Observations of the same
   Disturbance made at the Magnetic Observatories of Trevandrum,
   St. Helena, and the Cape of Good Hope.

The interest which Mr, Airy's Circular Letter has excited on the subject of

the magnetical disturbance, which was observed at Greenwich on the 25th

of September last, makes it probable that considerable advantage may be

derived, by immediate publicity being given to the observations which were
made on the same day at the Magnetical Observatory at Toronto in Canada,
showing the effects of the same disturbance in America.

    In the regular course of the publication, proceeding under the direction

and at tlie expense of Government, of the observations made at the Magne-
tical Observatories conducted by officers of the Royal Artillery, several months
would necessarily elapse before the observations of Se^Jtember 25, 1841 , woidd
pass through the press. Under these circumstances, the Master-General
of the Ordnance has approved of their immediate publication in a separate
form, Avhich will enable them to be communicated at once to the Directors
of similar establishments in all parts of the globe ; and the Committee of the
British Association, appointed to conduct the co-operation of that body in
the system of simultaneous magnetical and meteorological observations, have
deemed this a fitting occasion for the emplojnnent of a portion of the grant

placed at their disposal.

   The abstracts received from the Observatory contain the observations ex-
pressed in the scale-divisions in which they are read : these have been con-
verted by Lieut. Riddell, R.A., both in the tables and plate, into the more

-- --convenient forms, of angular value for the declination, and for the horizontal

and vertical force, of the proportion which the changes of those forces bear
to their whole amount. The plate also shows the mean daily curve of each
element during the month of September, the comparison of which with the
curve on the 25th aflPords a measure of the magnetic disturbance on that day,
both being reduced to the same Zeros.

   The perseverance with which the magnetometers were followed during
twenty hours, by observations taken at intervals of a minute and a half, is
highly creditable to Lieut. Younghusband and his detachment.

Remarks rdafAve to the Magnetic Disturbance at Toronto on the
                      2oth and 26th of September, 1841.

The disturbances appear to have commenced at Toronto nearly at the same

absohite time as at Greenwich, and to have been generally simultaneous at

both stations. . Additional observations were taken at Greenwich early in the

morning of the 25th, the needles being in an agitated state, and an aurora be-

ing visible. Though additional observations were not commenced at Toronto

at this time, the difference between the regular observations at 2 and 4 a.m.,

Gott. mean                        time,  show  a  considerable  disturbance                                                                     the  change  of  declina-
                                                                                                                           ;

tion between the hours                    of 2    and 4 amounting to                                                 15'"3                      the change of horizontal
                                                                                                                                             ;

force to '00444 of its whole value; and of vertical force to '00202 of its whole

value. The additional observations at Greenwich were soon after discon-

tinued, the disturbance appearing to be over.

The readings at 10 a.m., Gdtt. mean time, exhibited so great a change at

both stations, that extra observations were resumed at Greenwich, and com-

menced at Toronto.

The additional observations at Toronto were continued without intermission

for 20 hours, from 10 a.m., Gott. mean time on the 25th, until 6 a.m., Gott.

mean time on the 26th, each instrument being observed at intervals of 5 mi-

--nutes, in the following order, viz. : Declin. 00'" 0' H. F. 2'" 00^--V. F. 3TM

30=-- Declin. 5"" OOS &c.

The disturbance in the first hour (10 to 11) was not very great, compared

with those that followed ; but in the next 5 minutes, viz. from ll*' 00'" to

jjh Qgm^                          change  of declination  amounted to                                                19'*6                      and between      11'* 27""

and ll'^ 52"* the horizontal force had decreased by '01030 of its whole value.

These changes are specially noted, in consequence of there apparently having

been no corresponding disturbance at Greenwich.

The disturbance at Toronto was at its height from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., Gcitt.

mean time : its general effect appears to have been that of causing a decrease

of easterly variation and of total intensity.

The agreement in direction of the changes of horizontal and vertical

force deserves remark : the minimum and maximum of each occurred simul-

taneously, or as nearly so as can be learned from the observations, the mini-

mum of both being observed at the second reading after noon, and the maxi-
mum of both at precisely the same interval after the following midnight.

The observations at Toronto, being continued until midnight of Saturday

at that station, which was 6 a.m., Gott. mean time of the 26th, lasted about

five  hours  longer                      than  those  at  Greenwich                                                  and  during these five hours                a
                                                                                                                  ;

second disturbance Avas observed even greater than the preceding.

Between 4 and 10 p.m., Gott. mean time, the disturbance had been much

lessened; it then increased rapidly, and the changes between 12 p.m. and 6

A.M. were very remarkable : in 15 minutes the declination magnetometer

moved through an angle of 52''3, and in 25 minutes more had returned

through an angle of62''8 in the opposite direction. The horizontal and ver-

tical-tbrce magnetometers were also greatly disturbed, the change in the hori-

zontal force amounting in 20 minutes to '0122 of the whole force.

The changes of horizontal and vertical force in the last six hours have been

reduced to the equivalent changes of inclination and total intensity, and

are printed, for the convenience of comparison at these observatories, where

the variations of the inclination and total intensity are directly observed.

As the two magnetometers were not observed precisely simultaneously, the

changes of inclination and total intensity can only be regarded as approximate.
--346 REPORT 1841.

though the difference in the times of observation having been only 1 5 minute,

the errors occasioned thereby are probably seldom very great.

The observations of the second disturbance show a striking connexion be-

tween the changes of declination and intensity, an increase of force corre-

sponding to an increase of easterly declination, and vice versa : the same con-

--nexion was observed in the Toronto observations of the 29th of May, IS^O.
  Auroras, An aurora was visible at Greenwich both in the morning and

evening of the 25th. At Toronto the morning was heavily clouded, with rain,

consequently no aurora could be seen : in the evening the aurora was visible

at intervals from 7 to 10 p.m., Toronto time, or I to 5 a.m., Gott. time, the

period of the second great disturbance ; the remainder of the night was

Aheavily clouded.  gale of wind occurred on the following day (26th), and

in the evening another aurora was seen.

   The extreme changes of the declination, horizontal, and vertical force, du-

--ring the two disturbances, were as follows: of the declination, 1° 05'; of the

horizontal force, '02438 of its whole value; and of the vertical force, *01288

of its whole value. The days of occurrence, and the extreme ranges of the

principal disturbances observed at Toronto in 184'0 are subjoined, in order

tliat the relative extent of the present disturbance may be estimated.

   An aurora was observed on each of the above days in 1 840 ; that of the
29th of May was the most brilliant of any seen since the establishment of the

Observatory. Very few additional observations were taken either on the 22nd
or 25th of September, 1840; on the last day especially, the few that were
taken were not commenced until the greater part of the disturbance was ap-
parently over ; consequently the actual changes were, in all jjrobability, much
greater than those observed ; the recurrence of so great a disturbance on the
same day in the following year is remarkable. Additional observations
have occasionally been taken in the course of every month in 1841, in con-
sequence of unusual disturbances, but the changes have never equalled those

above mentioned.

   The months of September and October appear to be those of greatest dis-

turbance.

    Gauss's arrangement of the scale and mirror has been adopted for the
horizontal-force magnetometer at Toronto, in consequence of the disturb-
ance of the 29th of May, 1840, having driven the magnet beyond the range
of the collimator scale. The range of the declination scale (on Professor

--Lloyd's plan) being about 6°, or three times greater than the extreme range
--hitherto observed, there is little probability of its ever being exceeded.
          ON THE MAGNETIC DISTURBANCE AT TORONTO, &C. 347

  --Postscript, Dec. Hth. Whilst these pages were in the press, I received,

through the kindness of Mr. Caldecott, the abstract of the observations made
in September at the Magnetic Observatory instituted by the Rajali of Tra-
vancore, at Trevandruiu, in lat. 8° 30' 35-2" N., and long. 5^ 7"" 59^ E. ; by
which I am enabled to state, that an unusual magnetic disturbance took place
in India simultaneously with those observed in England and America ; al-
though, in consequence of the easterly position of Trevandrum, the com-
mencement only of the disturbance was observed there. Each observatory
discontinued its observations when its own Saturday night arrived ; thus the
observations at Greenwich continued five hours later than at Trevandrum,
and at Toronto five hours later than at Greenwich ; the latest observations, in
each case, showing the continuance of the disturbance.

   The observations at Trevandrum consist of the regular two-hourly read-
ings of the three magnetometers, day and night. By comparing the positions

of the magnetometers at each of the magnetic hours of the ?5th of Septem-

ber, with the mean position at the same hour in the previous twenty-four days,
we obtain what we may consider a measure of tiie magnetic disturbance of
that day. As the disturbance was indicated principally by the horizontal-
force magnetometer, we may commence with the comparison of that instru-

--ment, premising that as the inclination at Trevandrum is only 2° 50', the

horizontal intensity at that station comprises nearly the whole magnetic in-
tensity, the vertical component being extremely small.

than the average of the preceding twenty-four days of the month, by the
quantities shown in the above table ; and at the Giittingen hours of noon,
2, 4, and 6 p.m., when great disturbances were taking place at Greenwich
and Toronto, the observations at Trevandrum show a decrease of intensity

much exceeding the usual fluctuations. Mr. Caldecott has annexed the fol-

--lowing remark to the readings at these hours : " These irregular readings

" examined into at the hours they were made, and found not to arise from

--" any instrumental irregularity. J. C."

   On the 26th, being Sunday, no observations were made ; but the following

table, exhibiting the mean position of the magnetometer iti each day in Sep-
tember, shows that during the remaining days of the month the horizontal

intensity did not return to its previous average value ; corresponding with the
remark deduced by Professor Kreil from ten perturbations observed at Prague,

namely, that " the horizontal intensity remains weaker for some time after the
" great oscillations have ceased, and only gradually resumes its ordinary

" force* "

   this weakened state remained, with little change, until 2 a.m. on the 25th,
  when the force again augmented, and had regained about half the original
  loss at 10 A.M., the period when the disturbances at Greenwich and Toronto
  occasioned extra observations to be commenced at those observatories. At
   this epoch another great diminution of the horizontal force took place at St.
  Helena, and the intensity continued to weaken until V"* 42" 30^ p.m., when
  the loss since 10 a.m. amounted to -0118, and since noon of the preceding
  day, to -015 of the whole force. The magnetic inclination at St. Helena being

  -- 21°, the horizontal force forms by much the larger component of the total

  magnetic force : the approximate absolute horizontal value in English units

  may be taken at 5'9.

      In the account of the Toronto observations it has been noticed that the
   greatest disturbance of the instruments took place after the observations at
   Greenwich had been discontinued ; namely, after the midnight of Saturday at
  Greenwich. St. Helena being nearly in the same meridian as Greenwich,
  the observations ceased at nearly the same time and for the same reason : St.
  Helena does not therefore afford any observations corresponding to those of
   the second disturbance at Toronto.

     On Sunday 26th, the instruments were observed at 9 and 1 1 a.m., 3 and 8
  P.M.; and on Monday 27th, extra observations were commenced at 1'^30'"a.m.,

  at intervals of 30"\ and continued until 1 1 a.m., when the intervals were
  changed to 5TM for the declination-magnetometer, and to 10"" for each of the

  force-magnetometers, the extra observations being finally discontinued at
  midnight of that day.

    A table is subjoined of the mean positions of the magnetometers at the

  several magnetic hours during the month of September, showing the mean
  diurnal curve for the month of each element ; also a table of the mean po-
  sitions of the instruments on each day of the month, showing the monthly
  curve. It is seen by the latter table that the horizontal force was considera-
  bly below its average intensity on the 25th, and that it did not wholly recover

  the loss before the end of the month.

     The fluctuations of the declination at St. Helena, as at Trevandrum, were

  far less striking or remarkable than those of the horizontal intensity, or than

  those of the declination at Toronto and Greenwich. The magnetic disturb-
  ances at the tropical stations have not however always this character. During
  a disturbance observed at St. Helena on the 26th of June, 1840, the extreme
  range of the declination-magnetometer amounted to 1° 20'; and during se-
  veral of the most extensive movements of the declination bar, Lieut. Lefroy
  states that the horizontal-force bar remained perfectly at rest. The follow-

  ing passages are extracted from Lieut. Lefroy 's report of the disturbance

  here referred to (26th June, 1840), on account of their striking resemblance
 to some of the remarks in Mr. Airy's account of the recent disturbance at
 Greenwich :

    " On taking the reading for noon, my attention was called to the disturbed

 " state of the magnet ; I found it making rapid and irregular movements, with

 " sudden jerks and momentary pauses, too rapid to allow readings Two suc-

 " cessive movements frequently occurred in the same direction ; and another
, " unusual circumstance was, that the magnet, after a violent movement, came

 " instantly to rest ; it is for this reason that but two readings instead of three
 " are sometimes given.'" .

     With a view to a more complete examination of these singular phenomena,
 it is deserving of consideration, whether some slight modification might not
 be introduced in the mode of observing on such extraordinary occasions. For
 example, peculiarities of movement might be more advantageously studied
 and described by an observer, whose attention was not distracted by the ne-

cessity of recording the exact position of the bar at stated intervals of quick
recurrence ; and possibly a very light needle, read by a mirror, or by reflec-

tion from its own highly-polished side, and suited to follow more instanta-

neously than the declination bar the effects of rapidly-succeeding impulses,

might be found useful in exhibiting the effect of each impulse more distuictly.

An observer so circumstanced would note the time of those movements only

which should appear to him deserving of special notice. Such observations
might be made in addition to the readings of the magnetometers, which might

continue to be made at intervals as short as the strength of each observatory
will permit; and, where it can conveniently be done, the readings of the ho-

rizontal and vertical-force magnetometers should be simultaneous.
   In a letter just received from Toronto, dated November 19, Lieut. Young-

husband states, that though the curve of the 25th of September shows in-
deed extraordinary fluctuations, they are not to be compared to those ob-
served on the night of the 18th November (1841), when the declination
magnetometer ranged through above 86', and the horizontal-force magneto-

meter went beyond the scale in Gauss's method of observation ; a light held

in the prolongation of the scale, about one foot from its extremity (equal to
the length of about 200 divisions), was reflected from the mirror into the field

of the telescope: Avhence the force must have been diminished below the

average more than -^j^th of its whole value : the greatest rapid change of force

was equivalent to 0'03 of the total value, which was shown by a progressive

Amovement of the magnet during five minutes.  very brilliant aurora ac-

companied this disturbance.

 --Third Postscript, Dec. 29th. Whilst finally revising the last page of

this notice, the September returns from the magnetic observatory at the Cape
of Good Hope have arrived. Although the reduction of these observations,
for the purpose of subjoining them, would occasion an inexpedient delay in
this publication, it is satisfactory to be able to state, that the rerriarkable
disturbance under consideration manifested itself in that southern latitude
that it arrested the attention of Lieut. Eardley Wilmot at an early hour of
the 24'th ; and that it was followed by that officer and his detachment with the
utmost promptitude and assiduity. Extra observations, at the same intervals
as on term days, were commenced at 6'' 12TM 30^ a.m. on the 24th, and con-
tinued to 10 A.M.; resumed at 2^ SS"", and continued to 4 p.m.; resumed
again at Q^ 5" p.m., and continued without intermission for the succeeding
thirty hours. The epochs here spoken of are Gbttingen mean time. All the
magnetometers were greatly affected. The greatest disturbance of the hori-
zontal force commenced about 10 a.m. on the 25th, and attained its extreme
limit at ']^ 45"" p.m. on the same day. The vertical-force magnetometer was
deflected out of the field of view at 6^ 30TM p.m. on the 24th, and remained
so : the instrument being adjusted afresh to the needle, the latter was again
deflected out of the field at 2'' 27'" 30^ p.m. on the 25th.

    The observations at the Cape may form a supplement to this notice, ac-

companied by observations of the same disthrbance, expected to arrive by the
next overland mail, from the magnetic observatory at $imla in the Himalaya,

where, presuming it to have occurred, it is not likely to have escaped the in-
defatigable vigilance of Captain Boileau, of the Bengal Engineers, director

of that observatory. The September returns from the Van Diemen's Land
Observatory, conducted by Lieut. Kay, R.N., may be expected in February

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

about which time we may also hope to receive accounts of the same date from
Captain Ross, R.N., who intended to pass the last fortnight of September at

the Chatham Islands, where he would establish his magnetqineters on shore.

MISCELLANEOUS COMMUNICATIONS TO THE SECTIONS.

Addendum to the Report of the Transactiotis of the Sections

                                                  in 1839.

At the Meeting of the British Association in Birmingham in August 1839.

Mr. Nasmyth communicated three papers, one to the Geological Section,

on the Structure of Fossil Teeth ; a second to the Medical Section, on

the Microscopic Structure of the Teeth ; and a third to the Medical Section,

on the Structure of the Epithelium.

Agreeably to the practice of the Association, the paper read to the Geo-

logical Section was delivered to the Secretaries of that Section, Dr. Lloyd

and Mr. Strickland ; and an abstract of its contents having been prepared

by Dr. Lloyd, for insertion in that portion of the annual volume which con-

tains notices of the proceedings of the Sections, the original memoir and the

abstract were transmitted to the Assistant General Secretary (Mr. Phillips),

by whom the memoir was returned to Mr. Nasmyth.

With respect to the two papers read before the Medical Section, the prac-

tice above mentioned was not followed: no abstract of the contents of these

papers was furnished by or through the Secretaries of the Section to the

Assistant General Secretary.

Notices of Mr. Nasmyth's papers appeared in the Athenaeum and Literary

Gazette of the period: those journals usually obtain such notices either from

authors themselves or from reporters of their own : in the present case the

Council have been informed by the respective editoi's, that the report in the

Athenaaum of the two papers read to the Medical Section was supplied, and

the proofs corrected, by Mr. Nasmyth himself, and the notice of the geo-

logical paper by the reporter of the Athenaeum ; and that the report in the

Literary Gazette was drawn up by the reporter of that journal, from a rough

manuscript fui'nished to him by Mr. Nasmyth.

   In the October following the meeting, Mr. Nasmyth applied to Mr. Phil-
lips to know whether the papers read by him at the meeting would be printed

entire, or in the form of abstracts ; and was acquainted in reply, that, accord-

ing to usage, brief abstracts only could be inserted in the notices published

by the Association, and unaccompanied by diagrams ; the original memoirs

and drawings being the author's own property, and at his own disposal.
   On January 28, IS^O, Mr. Nasmyth informed Mr. Phillips that he was

preparing abstracts of his papers, and desired to know whether the papers

read to the Geological and Medical Sections on nearly the same subject

should be reported on as one, or kept separate. He also requested Mr. Phil-

lips to obtain for him, from the Secretary of the Geological Section, the

original memoir read at that Section, as an application which he had made

for it himself remained unanswered, and he had only rough notes of that

paper from which to make the abstract. Mr. Phillips informed him in reply,

1841.                                B
--2 REPORT 1841.

that one consecutive abstract of the three papers would be preferable, urging
brevity and despatch ; he at the same time returned the Geological memoir
(as already stated) on or about the 10th of February.

   On the 24.th of February Mr. Nasmyth transmitted to Mr. Phillips an

abstract, which he stated to contain the material points of the three papers,

abbreviated as much as possible, and requested 200 private copies. Mr.

Phillips has preserved no copy, and has no distinct recollection of his reply
to this request, but thinks it probable he stated the custom of the Associa-
tion in regard to private copies, and referred Mr. Nasmyth to the printer,

Mr. R. Taylor, from whom he would have to receive them.
   On the 2nd of April Mr. Nasmyth wrote to Mr. Phillips, expressing sur-

prise at having that morning received in type " a small fragment of a sepa-
rate report of one of his papers," after having been requested to give the
substance of his three papers in one consecutive abstract, and having com-

plied with that request. He was informed in reply, that it was by an error

that any notice of Mr. Nasmyth's geological paper had been put amongst the
papers of that section, beyond a mere reference ; that it should be cancelled ;
and that it was intended to give the abstract furnished by Mr. Nasmyth in one
continuous article in the proceedings of the Medical Section ; but as the manu-
script appeared very long, Mr. Phillips suggested some omissions, which being
assented to by Mr. Nasmyth in a letter of the 10th April, the manuscript
was sent to the printing-office. The proofs, of which the printer states there
were several, passed directly between Mr. Nasmyth and the printing-office,
the manuscript and all the proofs, except the last corrected revise, being
retained by Mr. Nasmyth. All the other sheets of the volume passed through
Mr. Phillips's hands in their progress through the press, as is the usual prac-
tice : the exception in this case appears to have been occasioned by Mr.
Phillips's temporary absence from York, and the printer's desire to hasten
the volume through the press.

   When the proofs were finally corrected, Mr. Nasmyth applied to the

printer for 100 private copies, and was informed that, without an order, his
request could not be complied with until the volume was published. Mr.
Nasmyth then enclosed, or brought to the printing-office, a note from

Mr. Phillips to himself, the exact purport of which Mr. Taylor cannot now
recall, but which appeared to him at the time to authorize a compliance with
Mr. Nasmyth's request: the copies were accordingly delivered.

   On June 10 Professor Owen wrote to Mr. Phillips, calling his attention to

--the following sentence in the Medical Gazette of the 5th of June : " In

" Mr. Nasmyth's own report given in the Transactions of the British Asso-
" elation, which has been printed separately, and of which a copy is now
" before us, we find it stated that the ivory is neither more nor less than the
" ossified pulp, and that it can in no wise be regarded as an unorganized
" body." Mr. Owen denied, on the authority of the contemporaneous reports
in the Athenseum and Literary Gazette, that Mr. Nasmyth's papers read at Bir-
mingham would justify an abstract containing the statement thus printed in
the Medical Gazette, and claimed the theory of the development of teeth,
ascribed therein to Mr. Nasmyth, as his own, communicated to the French
Institute and publislied in the ' Comptes Rendus ' in the December following
the meeting at Birmingham. Mr. Owen concluded by requesting Mr. Phil-
lips to suspend the publication, in the volume of the Association's Reports,

of the abstract containing the statement in rhe Medical Gazette, until its
fidelity should be shown by comparison with the original documents.

    Mr. Phillips expressed, in reply, his surprise at the information received

from Mr. Oweii, inasmuch as not having seen any proofs, he was not aware
          TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                           $

that Mr. Nasmyth's abstract had passed through the press, and as he had
certainly not meant to have sanctioned the delivery of any private copies
before the publication of the volume ; that Mr. Nasmyth, however, could
not be regarded as at all responsible for these irregularities ; that full con-
fidence had always been placed in the communications from authors, and

that no such question had ever occurred before ; and that unless Mr. Owen

should take the formal step of an appeal to the Council, in which case it
would become his (Mr. Phillips's) duty to await the directions he should
receive from that body, he could neither suppress nor suspend the pub-

lication.

   On the S^th of June Mr. Phillips addressed the following letter to Mr.

Nasmyth :

« SiR^                                           " York, June 24, 1840.

" I have this moment received from Mr. R. Taylor, for the first time, a

proof of the abstract of your memoirs on Odontology, and am concerned to

find that you have made additioiis* to it since I forwarded the MS. to be set

up. This is grievous ; but what astonishes me more, is to learn that, without

my knowledge, you have received copies of the paper in this unauthentic

state, and communicated extracts, or the whole, to a Medical Review.

   " These unfortunate circumstances place me in a painful position ; but their
effect is more to be regretted on your account, since they deprive me alto-

gether of the power of substantiating the authenticity of your communi-

cations.                                       " Yours very truly,

" Alexander Nasmyth, Esq."                       " John Phillips."

To this letter Mr. Nasmyth replied as follows :

          " To Professor Phillips.

tf Sir,                     " 13 A, George Street, Hanover Square,

                                             JTMe 27, 1840.

« It is with feelings of no little astonishment that I perused your letter of

June 24th, received yesterday ; and I am quite at a loss to divine in what
way I have deviated with respect to the publication of my abstract in the

Transactions from the ordinary course of proceeding. More than six weeks

ago, a proof of my paper was transmitted to me, and I was never more sur-

prised than on learning that you did not receive one before June 24th. I

corrected my proof, and received a revise of it, which I duly returned ; and

of course had every right to presume that either the proof or revise was sub-

mitted to the Editor of the publication to which I was contributing. With

respect to the corrections made, I at once undertake to prove that they con-

sisted in no interpolation whatever of new matter, but merely in alterations,

rendering the abstract a more faithful digest of my papers as reported in the

Literary Gazette and Athenaeum, and am therefore still more unable to un-

derstand the propriety of this interference with my clear right to do justice

to my papers in their authentic report. As to the printing separate copies

of my abstract, as I have had several letters from you, authorising me to

give publicity to it in any way I choose, I cannot suppose I was doing wrong

in making use of a permission freely granted.

          " I remain, Sir, your obedient servant,

                                                        " A. J. Nasmyth."

   * The words in Italics in this and the subsequent letters, and in the reports  to the Council,
were underlined in the originals.

                                         b2
--4 REPORT 1841.

On the 18tli of July, Mr. Owen addressed tlie following appeal to the

Council, to Mr. Yates, Secretary of the Council ; and informed Mr. Phillips

that he had taken this step :

" My dear Sir,                 " Royal College of Surgeons, July IS, 1840.

" You may feel assured that it is with very great regret that I trespass on

your valuable time in respect of a personal matter : if it had been, however,

merely personal, I should have refrained ; but the case is one that might be

quoted to the detriment of the character of the Scientific Transactions of the

British Association, with regard to the laxity with which authors, communi-

cating their views at the meeting, are afterwards allowed to represent them-

selves as having so communicated their views, when the volume comes, some

Mymonths afterwards, to be published.  request is, that the publication of

Mr, Nasmyth's paper in the forthcoming volume be suppressed, or the ori-

ginal paper, as read at Birmingham in August last, be substituted, on the

ground that it has been altered by the author, both in the way of substitution

of new matter, and omission of old, in order to include a discovery of mine,

published December 16, 1839, and likewise, because the author has made

use of the proof of his memoir, as so altered, to found a charge of plagiarism

against me, which has been published, anonymously, in the Medical Journals,

Lancet, and Medical Gazette.

" In proof of these allegations, I transmit the following :

" 1 . Literary Gazette, containing a verbatim * report of Mr. Nasmyth's Me-

           moir, as read at Birmingham, August 12, 1839.

" 2. ' Comptes Rendus,' containing the abstract of my Memoir, published

          December 16, 1840t.
" 3. Proof of Mr. Nasmyth's modified memoir, now standing in type for the

           forthcoming memoir.

" 4 and 5. Simultaneous attacks on me in the Lancet and Gazette, founded
         mychiefly on a comparison of the privately circulated jiroof, witii
          published memoir ; such proof being made to represent the Trans-

             actions of the British Association, Vol. VIII. (!)

" 6. My answer.

   " The question at issue is, whether Mr. Nasmyth described at Birming-

ham the cellular ivory of the tooth as being the ossified pulp.

   " I have marked with a marginal line the paragraphs in the Literary Gazette,
and the modified proof which relate to dental development,

   " Prof. Phillips has probably communicated with you on the subject. As
injustice will be done to me if the Association sanction the publication of

Mr. Nasmyth's views in the corrected proof, as exponents of what he enun-
ciated in August last, it seems to be a not unreasonable request that the pub-

lication of at least that portion of his paper in question be postponed till its
real correspondence with his memoir of August last be ascertained.

   " He (Mr. N.) has obtained Private Copies of his modified memoir, and

   * On a reference made by Mr. Yates to the Reporter of the Literary Gazette, the following

statement was given by that gentleman in explanation of the use of the word "verbatim."
   " The Report on the Memoir on Epithelium is a ' verbatim' copy of the rough manuscript

" supplied by Mr. Nasmyth. The Report on the Pliysiology of Teeth is fully and accurately
"given in accordance with the manuscript [supplied by Mr. Nasmyth], with the exception of
" those portions referring to diagrams, which would perhaps have more clearly explained the

"author's views, but wliich, without the drawings themselves, I considered could not have

"assisted the reader, and with the further exception of any eirors of judgement exercised by

" me, such as the above consideration may evidence." The paragraphs marked by Mr. Owen

with a marginal line were in the Report on the Physiology of Teeth.

    t Mr. Owen's communication to the Institute was read on the ICth December, and pub-
lished in the ' Comptes Rendus' on the 23rd of Decen bar.

has anticipated the publication of the Society's volume, by transmitting them

to the Institute at Paris and other Societies, as well as to tlie editors of joui'-

nals, for comparison with my memoir of December.

        " Believe me, my dear Sir, faithfully yours,

'^ James Yates, Esq., ^c. S^c,                     " Richard Owen."

*' Sec. Council, British Association."

   Mr. Yates was unfortunately absent from England when Mr. Owen's letter
reached his house. Both the General Secretaries were also on the Continent,
and most of the other members of the Council were absent from London, so
that it was found impossible to assemble a Council to receive and consider
Mr. Owen's appeal before the assembly of the members at Glasgow, at the

meeting of the Association in September.

   On the 10th of August Mr. Phillips informed Mr. Nasmyth in the follow-

ing letter of the course he felt it his duty to follow under these novel and very

embarrassing circumstances :

« Sir,                                            " York, August 10, 1840.

   " The course of proceeding which I have thought it my duty to adopt, in

--regard to the publication of your paper, is this : The printer will lose no

time in finishing the volume, the abstract of your papers omitted ; he will also

retain in type the whole of your abstract, in the form you have given it, in

order that, should the Council direct it to be introduced, it may, with as little

delay as possible, be added to the volume, whether published or not, and the

opinion of the Council on the case, so far as by copies of all the letters I have

received, and by reference to public documents, it can be justly stated to

them, will be requested on the very earliest possible occasion ; this being

what I conceive the line of ray duty, in consequence of the appeal which

Professor Owen has made to the Council (Mr. Yates and the General Secre-

taries being unfortunately absent). I shall be both surprised and grieved if

you interpret as intended injustice to yourself what certainly is based on a

conscientious desire to conduct myself rightly in circumstances such as hap-

pily have not occurred before in connexion with the British Association.

" That you should be dissatisfied with the suspension of the printing of

your paper, is an almost necessary consequence ; but I really cannot suppose

that your displeasure at this proceeding on my part will prevent you from

furnishing to the Council, through their Secretary, Mr. Yates, such of the

original documents which you mention as may be sufficient to prove the ac-

curacy of the abstract you desire to have printed. Should you, however, in-

stead of this easy and obvious method of correcting any error of mine, resolve

to appeal to another tribunal, the public, I will give you the only proof in my

power to offer of an unbiassed mind, by transmitting copies of all the letters

I have received from you, to render any statement you may think proper to

make as complete as possible.             " I am, &c. &c.

"A. Nasmyth, Esq."                                 "John Phillips."

To this Mr. Nasmyth replied as follows :

                                        " 13 A, George Street, Hanover Square,
                                                        12th August, 1840.

                    " To Professor John Phillips.

" Sir,

   " I have to acknowledge the receipt of yours of the 10th instant, and in

reply have to state, that notwithstanding I have already fully done my duty to

the British Association, it must be perfectly clear to you that I can have no

possible objection to submit the documents required to you for your satisfac-
6 REPORT 1841.

tion. It must also be clear to you, as you of course know the circumstances,

that I cannot consistently with what is due to myself place any papers, draw-

ings, or other documents containing unpublished matter, in the way of falling
under Mr. Owen's inspection, having suffered so much already in that quarter.

Since I have had the papers in my possession I have continued my investiga-

tions, and the blank pages of the original papers contain much recent original
matter. The books of drawings and separate sheets of drawings themselves

contain the requisite illustrations of these recent researches ; I could not,

therefore, on that account, submit them where they would run the least risk
of inspection by that gentleman ; and even were there no original matter, I
cannot, under the circumstances which have occurred, submit myself to any
tribunal over which he has the least shadow of control. However, I in no
way wish to elicit an opinion from you on these points, but I beg to say that
as you are the person who ought, as editor of the Transactions of the British

Association, to be satisfied of the correctness of any abstract or epitome pub-
lished by you in that capacity, I will, if you choose, either show you here, or
without hesitation I will even take the trouble of conveying to you at York

the whole of my preparations, drawings and original manuscripts, which I had
with me at Birmingham, under the express condition, however, that Mr. Owen

is not allowed to see them, or in any way whatever to interfere. I must re-
mind you, however, that all these have already been in your power, and the
MSS. in your possession for some time, and that every opportunity has been
rendered by me already for any one of the Council to satisfy himself on any
point : the circumstances which have since occurred, and those which I have
above alluded to, form sufficient grounds for not submitting any documents
to the Council again* as a body, though for your satisfaction, as Editorial
Secretary, 1 can have no hesitation in submitting them. In stating this I beg
it to be distinctly understood that I mean no disrespect to the body collect-
ively, or to its members individually.

   " I only wait therefore your answer, in the hope that as you alone are now

responsible for what is published, your eye alone need be satisfied, a satisfac-
tion which was equally in your power and that of the Council for some time
already, and which time was only limited by their own choice, and not by

any importunity on my part to have the papers back.

    " I need not observe that a great difficulty connected with the step of for-

warding my original documents is the size of the illustrations, drawings, &c.

the necessity of these to elucidate the original papers (the whole being a piece

of descriptive microscopic anatomy,) you may judge of by the desire I evinced

to you of having some of these illustrations introduced in the abstract. That,
however, shall not stand in the way of satisfying you, and prevent the neces-
sity of a step which I should deplore as much as any one. I can assure you,
Sir, that it was with the utmost reluctance I took any step at all with refer-

ence to Prof. Owen's treatment of me, but I am happy in feeling that every
member of the profession with whom I am acquainted, and many besides,
think that I have only done what was due to myself; and I am quite sure that
any one who knows me will give me credit for a love of anything rather than
disputes, especially public disputations, as my forbearance for so long a period
may testify. I have laboured hard for some years in a particular line of dis-

covery, and you would feel as strongly as any one that it is not pleasant to
have the results of your own labours appropriated by another, and then the
accidental position of that other on a Council of a Society where your own
discoveries were first made public (upon whose protection you throw your-

self) acting as a check upon the publication of an ungarbled epitome of what

you had really said.

   " Such is my case, and I leave it in your hands. I am very happy to know

that it is by Prof. Owen's instigations that this act of justice is denied me.

But I hope by the course I have proposed in this letter to induce you, as the
organ of the Association, not to commit an act of injustice which one inter-
ested member of its Council would induce it to commit.

   " I shall be ready either to go to York to communicate with you, or to see

you here. I need not inform you of the very great inconvenience it will be

to me to leave town even for a day at present, and it would be of much con-
sequence to me if it could be spared.

                                    " I remain, Sir, your very obedient servant,

                                                              " Alexander Nasmyth."

   It may be proper here to remark, that when Mr. Nasmyth wrote this letter,
Mr. Owen was himself a member of the Council : he ceased to be so in the
new Council appointed at Glasgow* ; and he was not present at the only
meeting of the former Council, in which the question of Mr. Nasmyth 's
paper came under consideration, namely, in September.

   Mr. Nasmyth 's offer to convey his original memoir to York, for Mr. Phil-
lips's satisfaction, was declined, as, an appeal having been made to the Coun-
cil, the case was removed out of his jurisdiction.

   On the 5th of September Mr. Nasmyth enclosed to Mr. Yates the follow-

ing letter, to be laid before the Council at the same time with Mr. Owen's

appeal :

" To the Council of the British Association.

" Gentlemen,  "13 A, George Street, Hanover Square,

                                   5th Sept., 1840.

" Professor Phillips, the Assistant Secretary to the British Association,

having, on a simple application from Mr. Owen, without any authority or

investigation on the subject, although I repeatedly offered him all the means

and facilities in my power, and even offered to take all the materials and
papers connected with my communications to York for his individual satis-

faction, at once suppressed, in the volume of the Transactions of the past

year, the Avhole of a report of three contributions made by me on three dif-

ferent subjects to the last meeting of the British Association ; though one of

these had not the sliglitest connexion with the point in which Mr. Owen's

application originated ; though all of them had been approved by the Coun-
cilf, read and demonstrated at the public meetings of its Sections, and the

original papers themselves had remained in the hands of its officers, and been

' reported ' under the direction of Professor Phillips ; and though the abstract,

made out at his request, had been, after his inspection, condensed and short-

ened at his especial suggestion, gladly inserted by him, corrected in proof

under his superintendence, and printed, and communicated to me in a sepa-

--rate form Avitli his authorization ; I now respectfully demand from you

the restoration of my abstract to its proper place in all the copies of the

Transactions hereafter circulated, and that an apology for its omission be

instantly circulated and sent to the possessors of the volumes hitherto sold.

If Professor Phillips has any cause of complaint against me, I shall instantly

privileges restored ; but I protest against his having first, without even the

certainly without an attempt on his part to try the validity of any justification,
taken extreme measures against me, and then, in fact, arbitrarily passed and

executed sentence upon me before trial, or even a relevant or distinct
charge. Such a line of conduct in my opinion savours of persecution, and
is certainly at direct variance with British ideas of justice, and I am confi-

dent that the British Association for the Advancement and Encouragement of
Science will never sanction for an instant such a total subversion of the fun-
damental bond of union of the Association.

   In September the volume of the Transactions was published, containing
in its sectional notices, the title of Mr. Nasmyth's papers read at the Bir-

mingham Meeting, but, as in the case of many other papers in that volume,

and in others, without any abstract being given of their contents.

   On the 15th of September, being the earliest day on which the Council

could be assembled, they met at Glasgow, having before them the letters
above noticed, and a statement from Mr. Phillips that he had never seen either
of the two papers read by Mr. Nasmyth to the Medical Section. Whereupon
the following Resolutions were adopted :

1. That the Council approve of the decision of Mr. Phillips to suspend the
   publication of Mr. Nasmyth's paper, pending an appeal to the Council
   from Professor Owen, relative to the correctness of Mr. Nasmyth's report

    of that paper.
2. That it be referred to the President and other officers of the Medical Sec-

   lion at Birmingham, to decide whether the report of Mr. Nasmyth's paper,
   as published in the Literary Gazette and Athenaeum, or in either of those
   periodicals, or the report of that paper sent by Mr. Nasmyth to Mr. Phil-
   lips for publication in the ' Report of the Ninth Meeting of the Associa-
   tion held at Birmingham,' is more correct in regard to the points under

   discussion between Professor Owen and Mr. Nasmyth, and that the Presi-

    dent of the Medical Section be requested to communicate the result to the
    Council at his earliest convenience.

3. That these Resolutions be communicated to Professor Owen and Mr.

    Nasmyth.

   On the 1 9th of November the Report of the Referees was received by the

Council : it was as follows :
   Reference having been made to us by a Council of the British Association

for our opinion whether the report of Mr. Nasmyth's paper, as published in
the Literary Gazette and Athenaeum, or in either of those two periodicals,
or the report of that paper sent by Mr. Nasmyth to Mr. Phillips for publica-
tion in the Report of the Ninth Meeting of the Association, held at Birming-
ham, is more correct with regard to the points under discussion between

Professor Owen and Mr. Nasmyth, we have carefully examined these seve-

ral documents, and it appears to us that the main point under discussion
between these two gentlemen is, whether the account of the process of den-
tition, contained in Mr. Nasmyth's paper, did or did not comprise the theory

find, with reference to this question, that in the accounts of Mr. Nasmyth's
paper, given in the Literary Gazette and Athenaeum, his opinions on that
subject are involved in considerable ambiguity ; for, while some passages in
them would imply that he considered the proper substance of the teeth as

being formed by the addition of ossific matter in the original structure of the
pulp, commencing and proceeding on its surface, these reports contain, at
the same time, other passages, in which the theory of the ossification of the
pulp is distinctly and expressly disclaimed by Mr. Nasmyth ; whereas in the
abstract of his paper, drawn up by himself, with a view to publication in the
Report of the Association, this theory is very explicitly and unequivocally
maintained. Whether this theory was distinctly advanced in the original
paper read to the Medical Section at Birmingham, it is not in our power to
determine, because that paper is not before us, and because we have no other
evidence of the nature of its contents than the printed documents already

    This Report having been considered, the Council resolved,
1. That the Council do not consider it necessary to make any further publi-

    cation of Mr. Nasmyth's communication than the notice inserted in the
    Report of the Ninth Meeting of the Association, held at Birmingham.
2. That this Resolution be communicated to Mr. Nasmyth and Professor
   Owen.

3. That the thanks of the Council be returned to the Authors of the above
    Report, for the care and attention which they have employed in preparing
   it, and that they be furnished with a copy of the preceding Resolutions.

   On the 8th of January 1841, the Council received, through their Secretary

Mr. Yates, a communication from Mr. Nasmyth, dated January 7th, still press-

ing the publication of his abstract in the volume of the Association Reports,
and expressing his readiness and desire to lay before the Council the engra-
vings from the drawings which had accompanied his papers read at Birming-
ham. There appeared from this communication reason to suppose that Mr.
Nasmyth might no longer entertain the indisposition expressed in his letter to
Mr. Phillips of the 12th of August, to allow the Council to have the original
memoirs for the purpose of comparison with the abstract ; and as by this com-

parison alone their agreement or disagreement with each other could be as-
certained, and the Council be enabled (on the supposition of their agreement)

to publish Mr. Nasmyth's abstract with their own authentication, the follow-
ing Resolution was adopted :

   " That Mr. Yates be requested to obtain from Mr. Nasmyth the original
memoir or memoirs read by him to the Medical Section at Birmingham, with a
statement that no alterations have been made in them ; and to refer them to the
authors of the Report to the Council, dated November 16, 1840, for the pur-
pose of enabling them to decide upon the correctness of the abstract presented
by Mr. Nasmyth for publication in the Report of the Ninth Meeting of the
Association held at Birmingham ; and that the Referees be requested to report

the result of their inquiries to the Council at their earliest convenience."

At a meeting of the Council on the 27th of February, the following letter
ID REPORT-- 1841.

was presented from Dr. Roget, addressed to Mr. Yates, Secretary of the
Council :

"Dear Sir,            "Bernard Street, January 21, 1841.

" Dr. Rees and myself, having taken into our consideration the letter which

you wrote to both of us the day before yesterday, beg, in answer, to refer you

to the letter of Dr. Macartney, of the 12th instant, addressed to yourself

(which we return inclosed), and to express our entire concurrence in the opi-

nion he there gives on the subject of the new reference made to us by the

Council of the British Association. The question at issue between Mr. Nas-

myth and Mr. Owen being one of considerable delicacy, we have thought

it right to protect ourselves from all suspicion of being biassed in our judge-

ment by ex parte statements or representations ; and we have accordingly

scrupulously avoided having any communication with Mr. Owen, either di-

rectly or indirectly, on the matters in dispute. For the same reason we must

decline the proffered interview with Mr. Nasmyth, and the more so as we

feel that the question, on which the Council request our opinion, would be-

come more involved and difficult of solution by the introduction of matters

really foreign to it, which would unavoidably result from such an interview.

The simple question, as it appears to us, turns upon the matter contained in

the original memoirs, in the identical state in which they were read to the

Sections of the Association at Birmingham. Mr, Nasmyth having subse-

quently made many additions and alterations in these manuscripts, and not

having consented to restore them to their former state, as proposed by Dr.

Macartney, and having declined to place in the hands of the Referees the ori-

ginal memoirs, as desired by the Council, we are consequently unable to exe-

cute the task they have requested us to undertake.
                                                  " Dear Sir, faithfully yours,

" Rev. James Yates."  (Signed)  " P. M. Roget."

    Dr. Macartney's proposal referred to by Dr. Roget, contained in his letter
of the 12th of January to Mr. Yates, was as follows:

   " If any reference be made to the officers of the Medical Section, the best
thing Mr. Nasmyth can do is to efface all the additions and interlineations
made in the original paper (having first taken a copy of them for his own
use). It could neither be desirable to him, nor to the Referees, that any new

or unpublished matter should be exposed, nor can sucTi exposure throw any

light on the subject. I, for my part, shall beg to decline the reference if any

writing be submitted to me, except what Mr. Nasmyth can assert existed in
the paper when read to the Medical Section."

   The Council then adopted the following Resolution, and requested Mr.
Yates to communicate it to Mr. Nasmyth :

   " The Council having at a former meeting taken Mr. Nasmyth's application
into consideration, and having referred the question to the authors of the re-
port to the Council, dated November 16, 1840, who have been unable to give

an answer on the points referred to, regret that they feel themselves incom-
petent to take any further step in the case*."

   The members of the Council having received a printed communication from
Mr. Nasmyth, dated 20th of March, 1841, addressed to themselves, a meeting

   * In a printed communication from Mr. Nasmyth to the Council, dated 20th of March, 1841,
in which this resolution is quoted, the words " regret that they," are omitted in the quotation.
These words were, and still are, in tlie original minute which Mr. Yates was desired to com-
municate to Mr. Nasmyth, and were accidentally omitted by Mr. Yates in transmitting the
Resolution to Mr. Nasmyth.
                 TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                11

of the Council was held on the 29th of March, and the following Resolution

adopted :

   " The Council having for the first time had submitted to them a copy of a
" document, (being a note at page 3 of a printed letter, dated March 20,
" 1841, signed ' Alexander Nasmyth,' and addressed to the members of the
" Council of the British Association,) which document they have reason to
" believe has not been seen by the Committee, together with other evidence
" which they conceive to be new, and to bear upon the subject matter of the in-
" quiry referred to them on the 15th of September, 1840, request the renewed
" assistance of the Committee on this difficult question ; and as the above new
" document purports to have proceeded from the Geological Section, the
" Council would request the President and Vice-Presidents of that Section to
" assist the Committee in forming their judgement and making their report."

   The Council requested Mr. Yates to acquaint Mr. Nasmyth of this resolu-
tion ; and as it appeared from his printed letter that he entertained some er-
roneous views with regard to the conduct and proceedings of the Council, they
also directed Mr. Yates to afford liini such explanations in reply as they hoped
might remove his misconceptions ; and furthei", to state expressly, that if they
were put in possession of a copy of the original memoirs, duly authenticated,
they might find it proper to publish an abstract of them in a future volume
this was accordingly done in a letter to Mr. Nasmyth, read and approved by the

Council.

   On the 28th of May the Council assembled to receive the report of the

Committee appointed by the preceding resolution (of the 29th March). Af-
ter a recapitulation of the proceedings on the two former occasions, the Re-

port proceeded as follows : viz.

   " The Council have since thought proper to request the same Committee,

to whom they have added the President* and Vice Presidents f of the Geo-

logical Section of the Association at Birmingham, to inquire into the author-
ity supposed to be given to Mr. Nasmyth's abstract by a printed document,
in the shape of a printer's revise, purporting to be the report, by the Editorial
Secretary, of another paper of Mr. Nasmyth's read to the Geological Section,
at the same meeting of the Association, which revise, he alleges, contains the
following passage, viz, ' the ivory is neither more nor less than the ossified
pulp-! and on which he founds an argument that an affirmation to that effect
had been distinctly made by himself in that paper.

   " The present Committee, to whom this question has been specially referred,

have procured, through the kindness of Colonel Sabine, one of the General
Secretaries, a certified copy;}; of the original manuscript report referred to
by Mr. Nasmyth, and which it appears was drawn up immediately after the
paper had been received, by Dr. Lloyd, one of the Secretaries of the Geolo-

                                                                             :"

gical Section. It is as follows

    (It is the subjoined document marked B.)

   " On comparing this manuscript copy with the printed revise, as quoted by

Mr. Nasmyth at p. 3 of his printed letter to the Council, it appears that seve-
ral alterations have been made in the original in its progress to that stage of
revision in which Mr. Nasmyth now produces it ; and in particular, that the
expression quoted by him in italics, as especially corroborating the fidelity of

his abstract, is not contained in it.

    " Your Committee then agreed to send the following communication to Mr.
Nasmyth through their Secretary :

  --" ' The Secretary of the Committee appointed by the Council of the British

Association, on the 29th March 1 841, to inquire into the authority alleged to
have been given to the report furnished by Mr. Nasmyth to the Secretary of
the British Association by a printed revise, purporting to be the report of the
Editorial Secretary of a paper of Mr. Nasmyth's, read to the Geological Sec-

--tion at the meeting of the British Association at Birmingham, is instructed

by the Committee to request Mr. Nasmyth to bring or send the original paper
which he read at the Geological Section at Birmingham, to the Committee, at
their next meeting, to be held at the Apartments of the Royal Society, at half
past four o'clock, on Saturday, the 8th of May, under cover, addressed to the
Chairman of the Committee of the British Association, Royal Society, Somer-

set House.'

   " Your Committee again met for the purpose of receiving Mr. Nasmyth's
answer, and found the following letter, addressed to the Chairman, had been
sent to the Royal Society :

   " ' Mr. Nasmyth begs to acknowledge the receipt of a communication, dated

May 5th, from the Secretary of a Committee appointed by the Council of the

British Association, on the 29th March 1841, to inquire into the authority
alleged to have been given to the report furnished by Mr. Nasmyth to the Se-

cretary of the British Association by a printed revise purporting to be the re-
port of the Editorial Secretary of a paper of Mi'. Nasmyth's, &c. Mr. Nasmyth
begs positively to state that he had nothing whatever to do with the drawing
up of the above-mentioned printed revise, and he takes this opportunity of
distinctly repeating, that it does not merely ' purport ' to be the report of the
Editorial Secretai'y, but must actually be considered as such, having been sent
to him by that gentleman precisely in the state in which it at present exists in

his possession.

   " ' The evidence in Mr. Nasmyth's hands, respecting the origin of this re-

port, he has already submitted to the Secretary of the Council*, as well as all
his original communications. In respect to the latter he begs to refer the
Committee to two letters in Mr. Yates's possession ; the one in print, dated

the 17th April, addressed by Mr. Nasmyth to the Members of the Council of

the British Association ; the other in manuscript, dated 27th April, and ad-

dressed to Mr. Yates himself.
   " ' Mr. Nasmyth is pleased to find that the question at issue, between the

Council and himself, is so distinctly defined in the note to which he is at pre-

sent replying; and in order that this matter may now at once be set at rest,
will the Committee have the goodness, as soon as possible, to forward to Mr.
Nasmyth the assurance that so soon as satisfactory proof shall have been sub-

mitted to it, that the 'printed revise' of the report in question emanated from
the officer of the British Association, satisfaction shall also be immediately af-

   * The printed revise in question was stated by Mr. Nasmyth to Mr. Yates to have been re-
ceived by him in an envelope, produced for Mr. Yates's inspection ; it bore the London post
mark of the 2nd of April, 1840 ; was directed to Mr. Nasmyth in the hand- writing of the fore-

man of Mr. Taylor's printing establishment, and contained the following printed sentence :--

" Professor Phillips will be obliged by the immediate return of this proof to Messrs. R. and J. E.

sure contained ia the envelope was the printed abstract of Mr. Nasmyth's geological paper re-
ferred to in his letter to Mr. Phillips of the same date (page 2). The "proof," which must
have preceded the "revise" in Mr. Nasmyth's possession, has been sought in vain, as well
as the manuscript from which it had been printed.

   The Council having failed in their frequently I'epeated endeavours to obtain
Mr. Nasmyth's original papers, or assured copies of them, for the purpose of
comparison with Mr. Nasmyth's abstract, are unable, on the one hand, to
publish the latter, authenticated as a faithful report of the papers read by
that gentleman at the meeting at Birmingham, or, on the other hand, to de-
cide that it is not a faithful report of those papers. They conceive that when

due consideration is given to the caution proper to be exercised in sanction-
ing the publication of papers in a case of disputed claim as to priority of dis-

--covery; and when it is remembered that Mr. Nasmyth's abstract, however

correct it may be, was not drawn up until several months after his papers were

--read ; and that in the interim the discovery which he claims for himself
--was communicated as an original discovery by Mr. Owen to the French Insti-

tute, and published as such ; the propriety of requiring the original docu-
ments, or assured copies of them, for the purpose of authenticating the abs-

tract, will be universally assented to.

   The Council would nevertheless feel great regret, that any man of science
who had favoured the Association with the communication of his researches,
should think that he had reason to be dissatisfied with the way in which they

were received ; and as Mr. Nasmyth, while withholding the original papers,
which are his undoubted property, still presses the publication of his abstract
in the volumes of the Association Reports ; and as the Council willingly ad-
mit that it was furnished in strict compliance (presuming its fidelity) with the
request of the Assistant General Secretary, under whose superintendence the
volumes are published ; they have decided on complying with his request for
its insertion in the present volume, though they are unable to pronounce
on its fidelity. They consider it right to publish at the same time that con-
temporaneous report of Mr. Nasmyth's two papers read before the Medi-
cal Section, which Avas furnished by himself to the Editor of the Athenasuni
Journal, and whicli is now reprinted from the original manuscripts so furnished
by Mr. Nasmyth, preserved by the Editor of the Athenaeum, and placed by

him at the disposal of the Council. To these they have added Dr. Lloyd's

contemporaneous abstract of Mr. Nasmyth's paper, read to the Geological Sec-

tion, which may indeed be considered to have the best claim of the three for

insertion in the volumes of the Association, having been furnished, in strict
conformity with the rules, by the official organ of the Geological Section.

The members of the Association who take an interest in this branch of Phy-
siological research, and wish to know what Mr. Nasmyth communicated to
 the meeting at Birmingham, will thus have before them the best information

 which it has been in tiie power of the Council to procure.
    The Council have also thought it right to prefix to these documents a concise

and continuous relation of their proceedings, which they now draw to a close, in

 a case of considerable delicacy and difficulty, the only one of its kind which has

 occurred in the history of the Association ; and they hope that by an adhe-

rence to the regulations which now prescribe the early publication of the an-

 nual volume, and by an observance of the caution inserted in the circular

SUBJOINED DOCUMENTS.

(A.) Reports of Mr. 'Nasmyth's two papers readbefore the Medical Section at

 ..^Birmingham, furnished by himself to the Editor of the Athenceum Journal,
   and printed in No. 620, page 707. Sept. \Uh., 1839. Reprintedfrom the
   Original Manuscripts, and showing the differences between the Manuscripts

Mr. Nasmyth read a paper " On the Microscopic Structure of the Teeth,"

in which he treated also of the covering of the enamel and of the organization

of the pulp. He first stated that his researches had led him to a conviction

contrary to that of Retzius, Purkinje, and Frankel, for he had found that the

enamel in all cases possesses a distinct envelope or coating. On the incisor

of the calf, and on several other simple teeth, he had also traced in it the cor-

puscles of Purkinje, analogous to those found in bone**. With respect to the

microscopic structure of the teeth, Mr. Nasmyth treated principally of the in-

terfibrous substance, which he said was not "structureless," as has been

erroneously stated, but decidedly cellular. The fibres themselves he described

as presenting an interrupted or baccated appearance, as if made up of com-

partments, which differ in size and relative position in various sei'ies of animals.

He detailed their peculiarities in the human subject, in some species of the

monkey tribe, and in the oran outan. After the earthy matter of teeth has

been removed by acid, the animal residue, he stated, consists of solid fibres,

and if the decomposition be allowed to continue, these fibres present a pecu-

liar baccated appearance. The general appearance of the fibres treated by

acid is similar to that of the fibres of cellular tissue generally, and the diameter

of each corresponds exactly to the calibre of the dental tube, as described by

Retzius, and which, according to that writer, is pervious, although at the

same time he says that it is always more or less filled with contents of an

earthy nature. With regard to the internal structure of the pulp, Mr. Neis-

myth stated that the number of minute cells presenting themselves in its in-

terior, in a vesicular form, is very remarkable. They vary in size from the

ten-thousandth to one-eighth of an inch in diameter, and are evidently dis-

posed in layers. The parenchyma of macerated pulp is found to be traversed

by vessels, and to be interspersed with granules. The arrangement of these

cells or vessels, Mr. Nasmyth thinks, may account for the shrinking or nearly

total disappearance of the pulp which he has frequently observed : their use

in the ceconomy of the part he has not yet ascertained. They are evidently

Hefilled either with air or fluid.  finds that they [constantly] f exist on the

--formative surface of the pulp. Mr. Nasmyth [now]f next* proceeded to the

[most diflScult department of the subject to that which former inquirers have

either evaded or treated very incompletely, viz. the]f nature of the process by

which the ivory is developed. The formative surface of the pulp, which is in

apposition to the ivory, and by which the latter is produced, he described as

presenting a general cellular arrangement, which he denominated reticular, re-

sembling a series of skeletons of a desiccated leaf. This reticularity is found to

have peculiar diversities in different classes of animals. Mr. Nasmyth has

found that a similar appearance is presented by the capsule and by the capsular
investment of the enamel. The leaves or compartments of the reticulation
are surrounded by a well-defined scolloped border, from which occasionally
processes are observed to arise at regular intervals. With respect to [the
actual process of]f the formation of the ivory, Mr. Nasmyth [candidly
avowed] f stated* that he was not prepared with a [perfectly] f satisfactory
theory, [but could] f and would* only submit a few observations based on his,

own researches. On the surface of the pulp, he said, are found innumerable

detached cells, with central points, which latter are at regular intervals cor-
responding in extent to those existing between the fibres of the tooth. The
cellules of the fragments of the ivory which are found scattered on the pulp
resemble exactly in size and appearance the cellules of the latter when in a
state of transition. Mr. Nasmyth is of opinion, that from the spirally fibrous
frame work of the reticulations are evolved the spiral fibres of the tooth.
The diameters of the two sets of fibi-es exactly agree. The projections on the

formative surface of the pulp correspond to the centres of the cells, may be

traced to belong to their structure, and are evidently fibres passing upwards
from the pulp. Mr. Nasmyth has also ascertained that the fibres of perfect

ivory resolve themselves by decomposition into similar granules. He has not

discovered the manner in which the osseous matter is deposited in the cells
of the interfibrous substance, but he has observed that these cells are subdi-
vided into minute cellules, for they present the appearance of being filled with
smaller cells in certain progressive stages of development. But in whatever
aspect, said he, we view the formative organs of the tooth and the dental tis-
sues themselves, and whether we examine the latter during the process of
their developement or after their formation has been completed, we are every-
where met by appearances which denote a cellular or reticular arrangement.
Mr. Nasmyth concluded his paper by a notice of Schwann's [recent] f work
on the cellular character of primary tissues, dwelling [more particularly] f
on his views of the cellular organization of the pulp, from which [as he
showed] f his own were essentially different.

   Mr. Nasmyth read a paper " On the Structure of the Epithelium," which
he described as being composed of cells. He first alluded to the views of

Leeuwenhoek on the subject, contained in letters to the Royal Society, written
in 1674 and in 1684-5, and according to which this tissue is composed of
scales. The researches of subsequent inquirers tend to prove that scales or
cells of various forms exist on the surface of all mucous and serous membranes,
on the inner membrane of the vascular system, &c. Mr. Nasmyth described

the epithelium as a layer of substance destitute of vessels, covering the vas-

cular surface of mucous membranes. The scales, as they were first termed
by Leeuwenhoek, of which it is composed, are flat bodies, with a thick portion

or nucleus in their centre, and with very thin and transparent margins, which
are sometimes curved : their surface often presents numerous transparent
points, with very fine lines. The nucleus of the scale generally contains a
 small body, which has been called the nucleus-corpuscle. If the secretion be
 removed from an irritated mucous membrane, these bodies are found to as-
 sume the appearance of cells ; but generally at the surface they resemble
 scales, from having increased in size and undergone compression. In the

 foetus the well-defined scales of the epidermis are not unfrequently seen ex-
 ternally ; the rete Malpighii consists of newly-formed cells, and between the

two may be observed other cells in a state of progressive development. In the

  epithelium generally, a nucleus is first [found] f formed*, and then a cell is
  formed around it. These cells are connected by a gelatinous substance, in-
  terspersed with minute granular bodies, which displays considerable elas-
 ticity, and which sometimes presents a fibrous appearance. The granules
  can be caused to disappear by compression. In certain parts of the epithelium
  of the calf, distinct fibres are observed to pass over the surface of the scales,

 and to connect them together, thus forming a very delicate net-work. On the
 surface of the body and of the mucous membranes of man and animals gene-

 rally, the superficial scales are thrown off by pressure from the cells beneath.
 But in some cases, as with frogs and efts, the epithelium-scales are removed
 in a continuous layer, and Mr. Nasymth is disposed to believe that it is the
 covering which, according to naturalists, is swallowed by the animal after
 having been shed. The cuticle and epithelium then are evidently organized
 [tissues] f bodies*. It would appear that they are formed from a fluid
 secretion, and that their various stages of development are as follows : 1st,
 the formation of nuclei and their corpuscles ; 2nd, that of cells j 3rd, the
 growth of the latter effected by vital imbibition ; 4th, their compression and
gradual conversion into minute lamellae or scales. The cells seem to have
 within themselves a power of growth, and it i-emains for pathologists to deter-
mine what share the derangement of this function has in the production of
cutaneous diseases. Under certain modifications the epithelium certainly pre-

sents vital phsenomena, among which may be mentioned the ciliary motions.
Mr. Nasmyth concluded his paper by an especial description of the portion

of the epithelium lining the cavity of the mouth. In the foetal subject, pre-
vious to the extrusion of the teeth, it forms on the alveolar arch a dense pro-

jecting layer, distinguishable from the surrounding membrane by its whiteness,
and by superficial and waving ridges and sulci. The younger the subject,
the greater is its thickness. It is made up of a mass of scales lying one
above the other, and thus presents no resemblance to cartilage, though it has
been generally classed as such. In the interior of its structure, where it cor-
responds to the molar teeth, small vesicles may be frequently observed, vary-

ing in size from one-fourth to one-eighth of a line in diameter. On micro-

scopic examination, the [parietes] -|- particles* of these are found to consist
of attenuated scales, and their cavity to contain a fluid abounding in minute

granules and cells. They are probably the "glands" described by Serres as

intended for the secretion of the tartar. Larger vesicles are also found im-
planted in the vascular mucous membrane, composed of a very delicate tissue,
and containing a transparent fluid, which coagulates on the application of heat
or acid. In this fluid float numerous globules and scales, similar to those of

the epithelium generally. The internal or attached surface of the alveolar
epithelium presents numerous fringed processes, which sink into the sub-
stance of the subjacent mucous membrane. These ai'e found to be composed
of elongated scales. By immersion in water or diluted spirits of wine, these
fringes are much enlarged, and their size, indeed, exceeds that of the dense

epithelium itself.

  gical Section at Birmingham ; printedfrom a copy preserved by Dr. Lloyd.

and which he is disposed to believe is so characteristic in different animals

as to be capable of affording valuable aid in the classification of the animal

kingdom. This structure he first observed in a section of a fossil tooth of a

rhinoceros, by the aid of a magnifying power of one-tenth of an inch focal

distance, with an achromatic condenser of the light. The section presented

an appearance of cells or compartments, the form of the cells varying in

different animals; the structure also of the fibres of different teeth present-

ing an interrupted or baccated appearance ; the size and relative position of

these divisions of a fibre differing in various series of animals. In man, each

division is of an oval form, and connected [by] their longer axes, which

correspond with the course of the fibre. In some species of quadrumana,

the fibre appears to consist of two parallel rows of compartments. In the

orang outang, the form is rhomboidal ; and in the baboon, they are oval, as

in man. The laminated concentric structure of the tusk of the mammoth,

the strength of ivory when cut parallel to the long axis of the tusk, and its

weakness if cut at right angles, are urged in corroboration of this peculiar

structure. The structure of the enamel, as seen in a section parallel to the

long axis of a tooth, presents compartments of a semicircular form ; the con-

vexity of the semicircle looks upwards towards the free external portion of

the tooth. The chemical composition of the enamel has hitherto led to the

conclusion of there being only a small portion of animal matter in enamel.

From Dr. Thomson's recent analysis it appears that this has been much

understated. The pulp is observed to be cellular throughout its internal

structure, and this structure is essentially concerned in the development of

the ivory, in the production [of] both [the] fibres as well as of the inter-

fibrous substance. There exists a great analogy between the internal or pro-

ductive surface of the capsule and the external or productive surface of the

pulp. The membranous investment of the enamel in human teeth, lately

discovered by the author, displays a similar arrangement. The crusta petrosa

is provided with a membranous investment.

  --1. The Capsular Investment of the Enamel. The Crusta Petrosa, said

Mr. Nasmyth, had been described after Retzius, Purkinje and Frankel, as a
layer external to the ivory of the fangs of the simple and compound teeth of
man, and mammalia generally, but as not present in the simple teeth, as a

covering to the enamel. Now this latter position he not only controverted,

but maintained, in direct opposition to it, that the enamel itselfpossesses iji all

instances a distinct envelope or coating. On the incisors and other simple

teeth of many animals he had succeeded in tracing, in this envelope, the

corpuscles of Purkinje, analogous to those found in bonef.

stance of the ivory. Purkinje and Frankel had stated that " the proper den-

lal substance consists of a uniform structureless substance, and of fibres
passing through it." Retzius, Miiller and others leave us to conclude that
the interfibrous substance does not present any traces of peculiar conforma-
tion. Here again he was at issue with these authorities ; for he believed,
and hoped he could demonstrate, both by preparations and diagrams (a great
and interesting variety of which were exhibited to the Meeting), that the
interfibrous substance of the ivory was not only organized, but peculiarly
and characteristically organized in different animals, so as to be capable of
affording valuable aid to the naturalist in classifying the animal kingdom.
In short it was cellular : tliis he had first learnt in examining a delicate sec-
tion of the fossil tooth of a Rhinoceros; afterwards he had found the same
appearances in recent teeth ; and subsequently in all the specimens which he

had examined.
   3. Mr. Nasmyth had examined the fibres of different teeth, and had gene-

rally found that they presented an interrupted or baccated appearance, as if
they were made up of different compartments. The size and relative posi-

tions of the portions or divisions of a fibre differ in various series of animals.

In the human subject, each compartment is of an oval shape, and its long
small extremity is in apposition to the one next adjoining. The long axis of
the oval corresponds to the course of the fibre. In some species of the mon-

key tribe, the fibre appears to be composed of two rows of compartments
parallel to each other, and a trace of the same appearance is evident even in
some of the principal ramifications of the fibres. (Diagrams exhibiting the

peculiarities of the fibres in the human subject, the Oran-outan, the Baboon,

&c., were laid before the Meeting.)
    After teeth have been submitted to the action of acid, the animal residue

will be found to consist of fibres in which the baccated conformation just
described can at once be seen. Mr. Nasmyth here displayed numerous dia-
grams, showing the cells and fibres of the ivory in different stages of decom-
position by acid. The diameter of the fibres he had found to correspond
exactly to that of the diameter of the calibre of the tubes described by Ret-

zius. He had decomposed the ivory in a solution of caustic potash, but had

not gathei-ed any new results from this experiment, owing to the brittle na-
ture of the residue, the difficulty of washing it without breaking down the
structure, &c. ; but still the appearances displayed in this process of decom-

position were such as decidedly to authorize the position, tliat the ivory

consists exclusively of layers of cells.

   4. Mr. Nasmyth stated, that having convinced himself of the peculiar
cellular structure of the ivory, he had engaged, with additional interest, in
the examination of the pulp, the organ by which the ivory is produced. Its
external surface, he said, presented a remarkable number of minute ceils, in
a vesicular form, which are found on further inquiry to form the principal
portion of the bulk of the pulp. The surface, moreover, has a peculiar re-
ticular conformation (described in section 5.). The size of the vesicles of

the pulp varies from probably a diameter of tq^q o*'^ P^^'*- ^^ ^" ^"^'^ **^ H^'^
of an inch. They are disposed in layers, and are of various shapes. Layers
of macerated pulp are found to be irregular, reticulated, and interspersed
with granules. Vessels in a direction which is generally vertical traverse
the parenchyma. Mr. Nasmyth had frequently been struck with the rapid
and frequent diminution in the substance of the pulp, which sometimes oc-
curs. There are even cases in which it would seem to be almost annihilated,
and this takes place more frequently in adult than in temporary, in other-
wise healthy than in diseased teeth. Mr. Nasmyth thought this phsenomenon
might be accounted for by a peculiar collapse in the congeries of cells com-
                                              TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  19

posing the pulp. The contents of the cells are evidently air or fluid ; but

they are so extremely minute, that he had not yet been able to ascertain

which. But the main feature of his position, viz. that the pulp consists

throughout of vesicles or cellules, and that these exist equally in the com-

partments of its reticulated surface (which he should immediately proceed

to describe), his researches, he apprehended, had placed beyond the reach

of doubt.

5. With respect to that difficult subject, hitherto so unsatisfactorily eluci-

dated by anatomists, the production of the ivory itself, Mr. Nasmyth con-

fessed that he had long devoted himself to its examination without much

success, and that even now he was far from regarding his researches as

complete or decisive. The formative surface of the pulp had first engaged

his attention ; this he had found to present a regular cellular arrangement,

which he had denominated reticular, and which may be described, he said,

as resembling the skeletons of desiccated leaves. (Of this structure, both

in its general appearance, its individual parts, and its particular varieties,

Mr. Nasmyth exhibited numerous drawings and diagrams to the Members

of the Association.) The general compartments of the reticulation are oval,

and overlap each other; when insulated, their structure is seen to be curious

and regular. He had first found them on the pulp of the human tooth, and

afterwards on that of all other animals which he had had an opportunity of

examining. The leaves of the reticulation are surrounded by a well-defined

scolloped border, on which processes are occasionally observed at regular

intervals. He had extended his observations to the capsule, and had found,

on its formative surface, a similar reticular arrangement. Mr. Nasmyth now

approached the question as to how the vesicular or cellular pulp, with its re-

ticular and imbricated surface, was concerned in the production of the ivory.

He was aware of the impossibility at present of completely describing this

process, which anatomists hitherto had for the most part eluded or passed

cursorily over, and should confine himself to a few facts which he had esta-

blished, and which he hoped would throw some light on the subject. In the

young tooth, he said, at the period of the formation of the first layer of

ivoiy, there are found on the surface of the pulp innumerable detached cells

with central points. These cells frequently form a regular and complete

coating, studded with points which are placed at intervals, corresponding in

extent, as it appeared to him, to those between the fibres of the adult tooth.

He exhibited diagrams of layers of these cells in different stages of their

transition into ivory. The points are rendered visible from the greater

opacity of the intermediate material, and will be seen to absorb or reflect

Athe light according to the difference in the focal distance.                comparison of

the superincumbent perfect ivory, with the surface of the pulp beneath, is

always easy (at any rate at an early stage), because portions of the former

remain adherent to the latter, and fragments of the dental bone are found

strewn over it, especially in human teeth. The cellular conformation of

these fragments is always evident, and in size and appearance they are per-

fectly in accordance with the cells of the pulp. He concluded therefore, that

the ivory is neither more nor less than the ossified pulp, and that it can in no

wise be regarded as an unorganized body. That the ossification is effected

by means of a peculiar arrangement of minute cellules, seems to be evident

from the constant presence of granules in the body of the pulp, and on its

surface                                  and  from the subdivided appearance of the cells, when in a state of
                                      ;

transition into perfect ivory. As almost all preceding writers had, he be-

lieved, uniformly described the ivory as a secretion from the pulp, he wished

particularly to insist upon its being an organic deposition of ossific matter in

                                        c2
--20 REPORT 184L

the pre-existing cells of the pulp. (Here diagrams of different layers of cells
in various stages of ossific transition were exhibited to the Meeting.) The
fibres of the tooth, as it appeared to Mr. Nasrayth, are derived from the frame-
 work of the reticulations : at any rate, the fibres bounding the reticulations
 are precisely analogous in diameter and direction to the subsequent fibres of

the tooth. He exhibited diagrams also in confirmation of this view*.

    6. The laminated cellularity of the ivory, M'hich Mr. Nasmyth had shown
 was a natural consequence of the cellular structure of the pulp, was also borne
 out, he thought, by facts coming under daily observation, or recorded by sci-
 entific inquirers, which could not be explained by any other theory ; viz. by
 the evidently laminated and concentric structure of the teeth of the mammoth,
 which is rendered directly evident during their decomposition ; by the expe-
 riments of Hunter on the teeth of animals fed on madder ; by the circumstance

 that ivory is found to possess considerable strength if cut parallel to the long

axis of the tooth, and that it is weak if cut at right angles ; and also by many

 other phasnomena of frequent occurrence.

   7. When the growth of the ivory is completed, the primary function of the

 pulp ceases ; but its residue, under the influence of disease, is often observed

to ossify in different parts of its substance. The bony substance thus formed
 resembles, when viewed under the microscope, the irregular ivory constituting
 the teeth of many of the lower animals, of fishes for instance, in which the
 pulp becomes entirely ossified. It consists of irregularly radiating filaments,
 blended with small calcigerous cells, in which ossified vessels ai'e seen to ra-
 mify. In some animals, such as the Bradypus, Trichecus Rosmarus, Mega-

 therium, &c., the pulp ceases at a certain period to be converted into ivory,
 and a peculiar and imperfect bony substance is then formed, until the whole
 of the pulp becomes ossified. In short, the simplest forms of teeth are almost

 exclusively composed of this substance ; and in many of those, which consist
 of cement and ivory without enamel, it fills up the internal cavity. It is so

 frequently present, is so perfectly different from the other dental formations

 in the mode of its development, the nature of its function, and the appear-
 ance which it presents, that in Mr. Nasmyth's opinion it merited the appella-

 tion of the fourth distiiict constituent substance of the tooth. It is of frequent

 occurrence in the human subject, but anoi'mally, and in every case in which
 he had met with it, as the sequela of long-continued disease, either of the tooth
 itself or of some part of the mouth ; but still he said it was proper to observe,

 that there is no direct evidence to prove that ossification of the residue of the

 pulp may not take place in the human subject without previous morbid sym-

 ptoms.

     8. The results of Mr. Nasmyth's investigations into the structure of the
 enamel were not quite in accordance with those of recent writers on the sub-
 ject. Retzius, Purkinje and othei-s had stated that the enamel consists of
 fibres running in a direction from the centre to the circumference of the

 tooth. On making a section of the enamel parallel to the transverse diame-

     * Before quitting this part of the subject, Mr. Nasmyth alluded to the recent researches of
 Schwann on the structure of elementary tissues, and with respect to the connexion which
 that author appears only to presume to exist between the unossified pulp and the ivory al-
 ready formed, quoted the following passage from page 125 of that author's work : " Against
 the theory that the dental substance is the ossified portion of the pulp, the facility with which
 the one is separated from the other has been adduced ; and I allow the force of this ob-
 jection. Nevertheless, it is at any rate weakened by the circumstance, that a portion of the
  pulp actually remains attached to the dental substance, and by the fact, that in half-ossified
 ribs, for instance, the cartilage can be easily separated from the ossified portion ; and it must
 be remembered, that in the tooth the separation must be easy in proportion to the difference
 between the consistence of the pulp and of the dental bone."

ter of the tooth, the appearance of fibres as described by these writers was,
Mr. Nasmyth allowed, distinctly evident. If, however, a different section be
made, for instance, one near the surface, parallel to the long axis or vertical
direction of the tooth, an appearance presents itself which had induced him
to take a difierent view of the structure of this substance. This was an ap-
pearance of compartments or divisions of a semicircular form ; the convexity
of the semicircle or arch generally looking upwards towards the free external

portion of the tooth. Several diagrams illustrating this conformation were
here exhibited. In sections, both of enamel and ivory, there will always be
observed, said Mr. Nasmyth, isolated cells near the margin, which admit of
their form and structure being carefully studied.

    All the analyses hitherto published of the chemical composition of the
enamel had favoured the conclusion, that it contains only a very small portion

of animal matter ; but when he had detected the cells or compartments just
mentioned, he could Tiot but infer that each of these had for its basis and

support a framework of animal tissue. He had accordingly immediately re-

quested his friend Dr. Thomson, of Glasgow, to favour him with a complete

analysis of the chemical composition of the different structures of the teeth in

their various states of health and disease. The results of this analysis, so far

as it had been proceeded with, were highly interesting. He laid them before

the Members of the Association in a tabular form, observing, that with respect

to the enamel. Dr. Thomson's experiments quite favoured the conclusion tJiat
it was provided xvith an animal basis, a result which, as he had just observed,
he had previously arrived at by means of microscopic researches.

    9. In a separate paper read before the Medical Section of the Association,
Mr. Nasmyth detailed his investigations into the structure of the Epithelium,
which he stated to be also composed of cells. Leeuwenhoek, he said, had
been the first to give an accurate account of the structure of this tissue*.

Leeuwenhoek stated the human epithelium and epidermis to be composed of

Hescales, of which he has left very accurate descriptions and delineations.

alluded to the scales or cells on the mucous membrane of the mouth, which
have since been proved to exist in various forms, on the surface of all mucous
and serous membranes, on the inner membrane of the vascular system, &c.
The Epitlielium Mr, Nasmyth defined to be a layer of non-vascular but not
therefore inorganic substance covering the vascidar surface of mucous mem-
branes. If, said he, a mucous membrane, for instance the conjunctiva, or the
buccal, be slightly rubbed, the microscope will show that numerous small
particles have been detached from it. At first, being flat bodies with a cen-
tral nucleus (sometimes absent), and a very thin margin (sometimes curved),
they present the appearance of scales, as they were denominated by Leeuwen-
hoek. Their surface often presents numerous transparent points with veiy
fine lines. The nucleus generally contains a small body, the nucleus-corpuscle.
These so-called scales, when removed from an irritated mucous membrane,
are found to be smaller and more globular; they have then the usual nucleus
and nucleus-corpuscle, but the surrounding structure is smaller, and in the
form of a cell. Here and there, too, the nucleus and its corpuscle are seen
to be isolated. In a section of the epithelium and mucous membrane nume-
rous nuclei are found in apposition to the latter, which, more externally, are
surrounded by a cell, whilst at the surface, this cell, compressed, assumes the
appearance of a scale. In the layer of epithelium, from the under surface of

the tongue of the calf, these bodies in their various stages of granules, cells

and scales, may be well seen, according ds the object is removed from or ap-

proximated to, the microscope. (Numerous diagrams illustrating these various
stages were laid before the Meeting.)

    In the foetus, the defined and well-formed scales of the epidermis are not
unfrequently distinctly seen externally ; the rete Malpighii consists of newly

formed cells, and between the two may be observed other cells in a state of
progressive development. On the surface of the vascular mucous membrane
minute cells are found tvifh a fiucleus internally, round tvhich the cells grow,
and this in short is the process of development of the epithelium.

   With respect to how the epithelium cells are connected together, a subject
which had not yet been discussed, Mr. Nasmyth stated, that on the surface
of the mucous membrane, the considerable spaces between them are occu-
pied by a gelatinous substance, interspersed with minute granular bodies.
This same substance also fills the minute linear intervals between the super-

ficial scales. (Diagrams were exhibited showing the arrangements in both

these cases.) The gelatinous medium is considerably elastic, as may be seen

under the microscope, on attempting to draw asunder the scales of the moist
epithelium. The scales towards the free surface distinctly overlap. The
granules of the gelatinous medium give to the epithelium, en masse, an
appearance of density as they sometimes cover the scales, but can be sepa-
rated from the latter, and indeed made to disappear entirely by compression.

In certain parts of the epithelium of the calf, distinct fibres pass over the

surface of the scales and connect them together, thus forming a very delicate
network, which is very evident on compression of the thick epithelium on
the anterior part of the alveolar arch of the upper jaw.

   On the skin and surface of the mucous membranes of man and animals

generally, the external layer of scales is continually being thrown off, in
consequence of pressure from those in process of development from beneath ;
after cuticular lamellae have been detached, their place is regularly occupied
again by newly formed scales. In some cases the external layer of cuticle

is removed, not scale by scale, but in a continuous form. The cuticle of the
frog is composed of minute scales, not overlapping, but in direct apposition,

forming one lamina of a beautiful, continuous, tessellated appearance. This
is thrown off at once from the entire bodies of frogs and efts. (Mr. Nas-

myth here displayed to the Meeting considerable portions of such a cuticle,
stating it to be his opinion, that this is the skin which is described by some

naturalists as being swallowed as soon as thrown off.) On a microscopic

examination of the skin of the frog, cells will be found internally, which
gradually change into the shape of scales, as they become more external, in
the same manner as has been described above.

    Mr. Nasmyth could not but conclude, from a consideration of the phae-
nomena j'ust described, that the cuticle and epithelium are organized tissues,
which are formed, as it appeared to him, from a fluid secretion on the surface

 of the chorion; the various stages of development being, first, the formation of

nuclei and corpuscles; second, that of cells ; third, the growth of the latter
effected by vital imbibition ; fourth, their compression and gradual conversion
into minute lamellcE or scales. It appeared to him a rational conclusion, that
the component parts of the cuticle and epithelium have within themselves a
power of growth ; it remained for pathologists to determine what share the
derangement of this function has in the production of cutaneous diseases.
The ciliary motions and other vital phaenomena furnish new arguments for

the organic nature of the epithelium.

    Mr. Nasmyth concluded his paper by an especial notice of the epithelium
of the mouth. In the foetal subject, previous to the extrusion of the teeth,
this forms on the alveolar arch a dense, projecting layer, distinguishable by
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  S3

its whiteness, and by waving and irregular ridges and sulci on its surface.
The younger the subject, the thicker is this epithelium. It is most promi-
nent over the molar teeth ; its internal surface is concave, receiving the pro-
jecting mucous membrane; it is constituted by a mass of scales, super-
imposed on each other ; and hence the terms " dental cartilage," or cartilage
of the gum, which have hitherto been applied to this structure, give an
erroneous idea of its true nature ; for cartilage always presents the corpuscle
discovered and described by Purkinje. Here, as in other portions of the
epithelium, (except on the surface of the vascular mucous membrane, which

presents simple cells with their corpuscles,) the external scales are the
largest. In the interior of this alveolar epithelium, where it corresponds to

the molar teeth, small vesicles may be frequently observed, varying in size
from a quarter to an eighth of a line in diameter. To the naked eye they

are transparent ; under the microscope their parietes are found to consist of
attenuated scales, and their cavity to contain a fluid abounding in minute

granules or cells. The internal surface of the alveolar epithelium frequently
presents concavities, from a line and a half to three or four lines in circum-
ference, corresponding to projections from the mucous membrane, formed by
a larger species of vesicle, which is deeply implanted in the vascular mucous
membrane. The parietes of these vesicles are delicate membranes; they
contain a transparent fluid, coagulable by heat, acid, or spirit, in which float
numerous globules and scales similar to those of the epithelium generally.
The external surface of the alveolar epithelium presents, after a slight mace-
ration, numerous fringed processes, measuring I'rom one line to one line and
a half in length, and half a line in breadth. Under the microscope these
fringes are found to be composed of elongated scales connected together,
forming masses, which divide and subdivide, until they attain such an extreme
tenuity, that the most minute terminations consist but of two scales, in mar-
ginal apposition. If the epithelium be carefully separated from the surface
of the mucous membrane corresponding to the unextruded molar teeth, and
placed in water, or in diluted spii-it of wine for some little time, its external
surface presents these fringes much enlarged, and forming a mass more con-

siderable in size than the dense epithelium itself.

On the relation of Sturm s Auxiliary Functions to the roots of an Algebraic
                     Equation. By Professor Sylvester.

   The author availed himself of the present meeting of the British Association to
bring under the more general notice of mathematicians his discovery., made in the
year 1839, of the real nature and constitution of the auxiUary functions (so-called)
which Sturm makes use of in locating the roots of an equation : these are obtained
by proceeding with the left hand side of the equation and its first differential co-

efficient as if it were our object to obtain their greatest common factor ; the success-

ive remainders, with their signs alternately changed and preserved, constitute the

functions in question. Each of these may be put under the form of a fraction, the

denominator of which is a perfect square, or in fact the product of many : hkewise
the numerator contains a huge heap of factors of a similar form.

    These therefore, as well as the denominator, since they cannot influence the series

of signs, may be rejected ; and furthermore we may, if we please, again make every
other function, beginning from the last but one, change its sign, if we consent to

use changes wherever Sturm speaks of continuations of sign, and vice versa.
   The functions of Sturm, thus modified and purged of irrelevancy, the author, by

way of distinction, and still to attribute honour where it is really most due, proposes
--24 REPORT 1841.

to call " Sturm's Determinators," and proceeds to lay bare the internal anatomy
of these remarkable forms.

   He uses the Greek letter " ^" to indicate that the squared product of the diflfer-

ences of the letters before which it is prefixed is to be taken.
    Let the roots of the equation be called respectively a, b, c, e . . . I, the determina-

tions taken in the inverse order are as follows :

{a, b, c, e . . . I).
^2 ^ -- 2 ^(i, c, e . . .
                                     a;  o (6, c, e . . . Z).

    -- --2 (^(k,l) (x--a) (x--b) (x c) (x--e) . .. (» A)).

   It may be here remarked, that the work of assigning the total number of real and

of imaginary roots falls exclusively upon the coefficients of the leading terms, which
the author proposes to call " Sturm's Superiors : " these superiors are only partial
symmetric functions of the squared differences, but complete symmetric functions of the

roots themselves, differing in the former respect from those other (at first sight similar-

looking) functions of the squared differences of the roots, in which, from the time of
Waring downwards, the conditions of reality' have been sought for. It seems to have

escaped observation, that the series of terms constituting any one of the coefficients

in the equation of the squares of the differences (with the exception of the first and
last) each admit of being separated and classified into various subordinate groups in
such a way, that instead of being treated as a single symmetric function of the roots,
they ought to be viewed as aggregates of many. In fact, Sturm's superior No. 1.

is identical with Waring's coefficient No. 1 ; Sturm's superior No. 2. is a part of
Waring's coefficient No. 3 ; Sturm's superior No. 3. is apart of Waring's coefficient
No. 6 ; arid so forth till we come to Sturm's final superior, which is again coextensive
and identical with the last coefficient in the equation of the squares of the differences.
The theory of symmetric functions of forms which are themselves symmetric func-

tions of simple letters, or even of other forms, the author states his belief is here

for the first time shadowed forth, but would be beside his present object to enter

further into. He concluded with calling attention to the importance to the general

interests of algebraical and arithmetical science that a searching investigation should
be instituted for showing, a priori, how, when a set of quantities is known to be
made up partly of possible and partly of pairs of impossible values, symmetrical

functions of these, one less in number than the quantities themselves, may be

formed, from the signs of the ratios of which to unity and to one another the

respective amounts of possible and impossible quantities may at once be inferred :
in short, we ought not to rest satisfied, until, from the very form of Sturm's Deter-
minators, without caring to know how they have been obtained, we are able to
pronounce upon the uses to which they may be applied.

On the Theoretical Computation of Refractive Indices. By Prof. Powell.

In the Report on Refractive Indices which the author had presented to the Asso-

ciation, his professed object extended only to exhibiting the results of observation,

without any reference to theory. That the comparison of these results with theory

is highly important is indeed manifest ; and the necessity for it is dwelt upon

(in reference to the Report just mentioned) in the address' of the General Secre-

taries at the meeting of 1840. It would, however (on several grounds), have been

foreign to the design of that Report to have introduced the subject of theoretical com-

putation. The author has since that period been devoting his attention to this latter

subject                              and it is the object of  the  present  communication  to  state  very  briefly the
                                  ;

progress made in it. The results in the Report on Indices are classified under three

heads : 1st, those of Fraunhofer ; 2nd, those of Rudberg ; 3rd, those derived from the

latest observations of the author, comprising many tieiv results, superseding former

ones, and others, the combined results of several sets of earlier observations compared

with later. The 1st series was compared with theory, 1st, by the author in the Phil.

Trans. 1835, but only by an approximative and tentative method; 2nd]y, by Mr.

Kelland, by a direct and exact method in the Camb. Trans., vol. vi. ; Srdly, for the

process. The 2nd series has been computed only by the author, by the same ap-
proximative method as the 1st, in the Phil. Trans. 1836, whence it was reprinted in
Poggendorff's ' Annalen.' Some of the first results belonging to the 3rd series were

computed by the author, by Sir W. R. Hamilton's method, in the Phil. Trans. 1837
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

and three of the higher cases, in which discrepancies appeared, were recomputed by
Mr. Kelland's method in the Phil. Trans. 1838. Thus it was desirable to recompute

series 2. by an exact method, and necessary to calculate all the new and improved re-

sults of series 3. This the author has now done, by means of Sir W. R. Hamilton's

formula, and for the sake of uniformity has included series 1. The results agree

perfectly with observation, except in the most highly dispersive cases. But here it is

found, that if an empirical change be allowed in one of the constants for each medium,
a sufficiently close accordance is obtained.

         On the Refraction of Heat. By Prof. Powell.

In a short communication to the Physical Section of the British Association,

--1840, the author alluded to that singular result of the undulatory view of dispersion
   the existence of a limit to all refraction in each medium, at no very great interval

below the least refrangible end of the visible spectrum ; and suggested the com-

parison of observations on the refraction of heat with this conclusion. He has

since followed up that suggestion, in reference to the only medium as yet examined

in which it is practicable to compare the refractions of light and of heat, viz. rock-

salt. In his Report on Radiant Heat, he has stated Prof. Forbes's indices for

the different kinds of heat, corrected according to the Professor's own suggestion

from the approximate form in which they were at first given. The proposed cor-

rection, however, allows of some latitude ; and, on reconsideration of the subject,

as before stated, it appears to the author most fair to take Prof. Forbes's result for
--light as obtained with the Locatelli lamp. This corrected by
                                                                "04, gives for

the mean light /^ =: 1'558, which agrees sufficiently with the author's own obser-

vations conducted by a totally different method (see Report on Refractive Indices,

1839). With the same correction, the extreme index for the least refrangible kind of

=heat is /n 1 "528. By theory the author has computed the value of the limiting index
^above mentioned, and finds it to be ft 1"5277 ; also the index for a mean ray of heat
=whose wave-length is "000079 inch, is found to be /i 1'529. Considering that Prof.

Forbes allows some uncertainty in his results, this affords a very satisfactory confir-

mation.

   On certain Points of the Wave-Theory of Light. By Prof. Powell.

   At the Birmingham meeting of the British Association the author offered a short
communication relative to certain difficulties connected with the equations of mo-
tion on which the wave-theory is now founded, which had given rise to some con-
troversy. Since that time, however, he conceives the main difficulties have been
completely cleared up ; it was his endeavour to put the chief part of the subject,
in this elucidated point of view, in a paper in the Philosophical Mag., March 1841,
and he has since been engaged in embodying these and other points in a separate
work. The whole theory of the dispersion is referred to the primary equations

of motion, originally suggested by M. Navier, agreeably to the principles of M.

Cauchy, since improved upon by others. The forms assumed by these equations, in
connexion with the symmetrical or unsymmetrical arrangement of the etherial mole-
cules, have a direct relation to the occurrence of rectilinear or elliptic vibrations, a

distinction first pointed out by Mr. Tovey. When the arrangement is symmetrical,

the existence of axes of elasticity (discovered by Fresnel), as well as the general in-
vestigation of the wave-surface, has been shown by Sir J. Lubbock to be deducible
from the same primary equations ; and the difference in form between the wave-
surface equations of Fresnel and of Cauchy is traceable to differences in the forms of
the same equations. (A synopsis of the principal formulae referred to accompanied

the paper.)

Results of some Investigations on the Phcenomena of Tliin Plates in Polarized

                Light. By the Rev. Professor Lloyd, F.R.S.

    Professor Lloyd stated, that his attention had been drawn to this subject by a
 letter which he had recently received from Sir David Brewster, describing a large
 class of hitherto unobserved phsenomena. Sir David Brewster having expressed his
 desire, in this letter, to know whether the wave-theory could furnish an explanation
 of the facts which he had observed. Prof. Lloyd was thus led to undertake the inves-
tigation which formed the subject of the present communication.

    Mr. Airy had long since inferred, from a consideration of the form of Fresnel's
expression for the intensity of reflected light, that when light, polarized perpendicu-
larly to the plain of incidence, was incident upon a thin plate bounded by media of
unequal refractive powers, a remarkable change in the reflected light should take
place, when the angle of incidence was intermediate to the polarizing angles of the
two surfaces of the plate. This theoretical anticipation was fully verified by experi-

ment. When a lens of low refracting power was laid upon a plate of high refracting

power, the rings which were formed appeared with a hlack centre, when the angle of
incidence was less than the polarizing angle of the low refracting substance, or
greater than the polarizing angle of the high refracting substance ; while, when the
incidence was intermediate to these two angles, the rings were white-centred, and the
whole system was complementary to what it had been before. At the polarizing angle
itself the rings disappeared, there being no light reflected from one of the surfaces

of the plate, and therefore no interference.
   The examination of this subject has recently been resumed by Sir David Brewster ;

and he has repeated the experiments of Mr. Airy in a more general form, the in-

cident Wghth^mg polarized in any plane. He has thus been led to many new results.

The rings are found to disappear under circumstances in which light is reflected from
hoth surfaces of the plate ; and there are many remarkable peculiarities in the transi-
tion of the rings into the complementary system.

   It was to the theoretical explanation of these phasnomena that Prof. Lloyd now

invited the attention of the Section. In the conduct of the investigation he has

generalized the methods followed by M. Poisson and Mr. Airy on the same subject.

The incident vibration being resolved into two, one in the plane of incidence, and

the other in the perpendicular plane, each portion will give rise to an infinite series
of reflected vibrations, into which it is subdivided at the bounding surfaces of the
plate. The expression of the resultant intensity, for each portion, being then de-

duced, the actual intensity of the reflected beam is the sum of these intensities
and it is found that the part dependent on the phase will vanish, and therefore the
rings disappear, when the plane of polarization is connected with the incidence of

the following formula :           - --cos (6

                         2_       6') cos {ff  ff')
                           '^ ~"
                                  + ncos {6+ $') cos {&'  '

in which d is the angle of incidence on the first surface ; 6' the angle of refraction at
first surface, or the angle of incidence on second ; and 6" the angle of refraction at

second surface.

On Simultaneous Changes of the Magnetic Elements at Different Stations.

                     By the Rev. Professor Lloyd, F.R.S.

   Professor Lloyd laid upon the table of the Section a series of curves prepared by
Lieut. Riddell, representing the simultaneous changes of the magnetical elements,
observed at Toronto, Dublin, Brussels, Prague, Milan, St. Helena, and Van Diemen's

Land, on the 29th of May and 29th of August 1840.
   He said, that one of the chief objects kept in view in the arrangement of this great

system of combined observation now in operation, was the extension of the plan of
simultaneous observations at short intervals of time, first laid down by Gauss. The

results of this system had been, that the observed changes of the magnetical elements
were strictly simultaneous at the most remote stations at which observations had
been hitherto made ; and that these changes followed in all cases the same laws, the
representative curves being similar to one another in all their inflexions, and differing
only in the magnitude of the change. This similarity had been found to extend to
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                               27

the utmost limits of Europe, and to hold at stations as remote as Dublin, Petersburg,

and Milan. It became therefore a question of great interest in the extension of this
system to still more distant stations, to determine whether there were any, and what

limits to this accordance. This question was determined by the very first results of

the observations recently established by the British Government ; and the observa-

tions now laid before the Section were selected as elucidating it in a very marked

manner. These observations were those of the declination and horizontal magnetic

intensity observed at Brussels, Milan, Prague, Toronto, and St. Helena, on the 29th

of May 1840 ; and at Dubhn, Toronto, St. Helena, and Van Diemen's Land, on the

29th of August of the same year. The magnetical disturbances which occurred on

these days were among the most considerable which had been as yet observed. On

the former days the declination at Toronto underwent a sudden change, amounting

to 1° 52' in about twenty minutes of time, while the disturbance of the horizontal force

was so great as to carry the magnet beyond the limits of its scale. On the latter day,

the greatest change of the declination amounted to 1° 26' at Toronto, and to 1° 18' at

Dublin. The greatest change of the horizontal intensity at the former station amounted

to -'028, or about -sVth part of the whole intensity ; while at Dublin the change was
even greater, and extended beyond the scale of the instrument. It is probable that

an attentive comparison of the curves may lead to many important results ; but

there are some which appear upon a cursory inspection, which Mr. Lloyd said that

he should now notice. The first of these was, that the greater magnetic disturbances

appeared to be synchronous at the most distant stations. This important fact is ex-

hibited much more evidently in the changes of horizontal intensity than in those of

declination ; and, if verified by further comparisons, leads to the conclusion, that the
principal forces which disturb the magnetic equilibrium of the earth are not of local

agency. The next circumstance which merited attention was, that the order of the

changes was no longer regulated  by the same   law, at very remote  stations                                the re-
                                                                                                         ;

presentative curves exhibiting none of that similarity already referred to, which was

shown within the limits of Europe, and the epochs of the successive maxima and

minima presenting no agreement whatever. This important fact was first brought to

light in the course of a series of simultaneous observations, made by Professor Bache

at Philadelphia, and by himself at Dublin, in November 1839, in the hope of deter-

mining differences of longitude by means of the corresponding movements of the

magnet at the two stations. The changes observed in the observations at present

under consideration were, however, far greater in magnitude, and placed the pheeno-

menon in a much stronger light. The last circumstance to which Mr. Lloyd invited

the attention of the Section was, that the curves of horizontal intensity presented a

much nearer agreement at remote stations than those of declination ; from which it
may be inferred, that a true knowledge of the nature and laws of the disturbing

causes will be better attained by the examination of intensity changes (including, of

course, those of the vertical intensity) than of those which are dependent solely on

the direction of the acting forces. There were many other points of minor interest

suggested by the examination of these curves ; such as the appearance of a correspond-
ence in some of the minuter changes at all the stations, although the resemblance in

the greater changes was obliterated. If this should prove to be anything more than

a mere fortuitous coincidence, the result might be expected to lead to some important

conclusions with regard to the acting forces.

   Professor Lloyd then laid upon the table the curves representing the changes of

magnetic declination, observed at Cambridge University (Massachusetts) by Mr. W. C.
Bond, on the term-days of May and October 1840. The corresponding observations

made at the magnetical observatory at Toronto, by Lieut. Riddell, were laid down

in a curve, in connexion with the latter. The results exhibited the same close agree-

ment in the forms of the curves, and in the epochs of the successive maxima and

minima, as had been already noticed in Europe, although (as before remarked) all

resemblance between these and the European system of changes is nearly obliterated.

New Cambridge is distant about 500 miles from Toronto ; the mean declination there

is 9° 20' west.

--which, with Mr. Dury,he had lately the honour of submitting to his Royal Highness

Prince Albert. The points treated of were
   The defective condition of ordinary needles employed in sea-compasses, and the

method used by Dr. Scoresby to test their condition, by applying them to a highly-
magnetized hardened bar of the best cast steel.

   The nature of the needles which Dr. Scoresby recommends to be substituted for
the former. They are hardened throughout, and previous to being used, are tested
by being applied to the bar already mentioned.

   The application of delicate needles and large bar-magnets to measure the thickness
of rocks, &c., and other materials, in mines, railway tunnels, &c.

   The construction and method of magnetizing of a pair of bar-magnets, containing
192 thin steel plates fourteen inches long and one and a half inch broad, bound to-
gether with tape. They are very unusually powerful.

On the Influence of Mountains on Temperature in the Winter in certain parts

            of the Northern Hemisphere. By Thomas Hopkins.

   It was stated by Mr. Hopkins, that between the latitudes of 40° and 70° north,
there is in the same parallels a great difference of temperature, particularly in the
winter, amounting in some cases to as much as 40° or even 50° of Fahrenheit. The
western coasts of the two continents are much warmer than the eastern, and as
the winds generally blow from the sea to the western coasts, it has been inferred,
that the prevailing winds passing over sea to the western coasts, and over land to
the eastern, was the cause of the difference in the temperature. This inference is
not, however, in accordance with facts, as the low temperature is not proportioned
to the distance from the western coast.

    Hadley's theory represents the tropical atmosphere as rising and flowing over

at the top towards the polar regions, and returning when cooled, flowing along on
the surface of the earth. This inequality of temperature in the atmosphere would
cause an upper current to flow north, and an under current to flow south. But

the unequal velocities of the different parts of the earth's surface from the equator
to the pole modify the course of these currents, and make the upper a south-west
and the lower a north-east current, as shown by lines on a Mercator's chart.

   Tliis theory, true in its leading principles, does not account for what occurs on

the earth's surface, because it does not take in all the causes that are in operation,

which causes materially modify the general results.
   The Polar current, in flowing from the north-eastern part towards the south-west,

meets with elevations of the land, and is consequently, along a diagonal stripe in
the direction of the general currents, obstructed in its progress, and sometimes
stopped, and obliged to turn back as an upper current towards the pole ; while be-
yond the obstruction, nearer to the equator, the tropical or upper current not being
met by a polar current along this line, flows towards the obstruction, from whence
it returns, partially cooled, as an under current.

   In the New world, the ridge of mountains which extends from Mexico by the

Rocky Mountains to the Frozen Ocean, crosses the diagonal line of the great at-
mospherical currents, and constitutes such an obstruction as that described.

    In the Old world similar ridges extend from the southern point of the Himalaya
Mountains to the Swiss Alps, including the range of the Himalaya, Hindoo Koosh,
Central Asia, Armenia, Circassia, the Carpathian Mountains, and the Illyrian and
Swiss Alps, and the climates found to the north-east of these chains are materially
different from those which exist to the south-west.

   The greatest differences of climate in those parts are found in the beginning of win-
ter, and are, it is presumed, caused by the different quantities of atmospheric steam
condensed in the respective parts.

    Over the tropical seas a quantity of steam exists in the atmosphere sufficient to
give a dew-point of 80°, making the steam one forty-eighth part of the whole atmo-
sphere. This steam, which if all condensed into water, would give a depth of about
nine inches, is regularly carried in the autumn and the beginning of the winter,

when the northern hemisphere is cooled, from the tropical regions in a north-east
direction towards the polar regions, or towards some obstructing elevation of the
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  29

land, and is to a great extent condensed ; and to its condensation we are to look for

the great differences of winter climate in the same latitudes of the northern hemi-

sphere.

   The steam in the tropical regions of the Pacific Ocean that flows towards the
north-east, with the south and south-west winds that prevail in those parts, is car-
ried to the American ridge, and is there condensed. The result is, that the south-
west side of this chain of mountains is wet and warm in the winter, from the tropics
to Nootka Sound, and still further north. Captain Cook, Lewis and Clarke, Cap-
tain B. Hall, and Humboldt, describe the climate of this part in such terms as can
leave no doubt of the fact. But beyond this ridge to the north-east we have a
different climate in the winter, one as remarkably cold and dry as that on the other
side is wet and warm. Captain Parry, Captain Back, and Lewis and Clarke, re-
present the country in the winter from the shores of the Frozen Sea to the Missouri
as very cold and generally dry. Here we trace the effects of the condensation of

steam, and of its absence, on the climates of these parts.

   In the Old world the same causes produce the same effects. On the south-west

sides of the various ridges of mountains, the weather is in the autumn and early

part of winter very wet and warm for the latitudes. This is particularly seen in

Hindoostan and the south-west coast of Italy, while to the north-east of these
mountains the climate is cold and dry, over Poland, Russia, Central Asia, and

Siberia.

   The very heavy rains which fall to the south of the Himalaya Mountains indicate
the great condensation of steam that takes place in that part of the world ; and the
effect produced on the climate is remarkable. The valleys are habitable to a great
elevation ; and Major Archer states that wheat is grown at a height of 13,000 feet
in latitude 32° north, whilst Humboldt represents 1300 feet as the greatest height
at which wheat can be grown in Teneriffe, a place four degrees more south. But
when the steam that is in the atmosphere is all, or nearly all, condensed against the
sides of elevated ridges, it is evident that it cannot carry its warming influence
further north. Hence the part of the globe between these ridges and the polar
regions will, in the autumn and winter, be dry and very cold.

    In continuation, the author illustrated his views by supposing cases of great
changes of the elevation of land and the distribution of land and water on the globe.

   From the whole inquiry he concludes, that the relative situations of land and

water are not the cause of the great differences of climate in corresponding latitudes ;
but that the great differences in the winter climates of certain parts of the northern
hemisphere are attributable to elevations of land intercepting and condensing atmo-

spheric steam, and thus rendering certain parts wet and warm, while cutting off the
supply from more northern parts leaves them dry and cold.

   On the Temperature of the Air in York Minster. By John Phillips,

                                                    F.R.^.f Gr.iS.

   It may be remarked, that the vastness and loftiness of the interior of York Minster

render the air within it, in a great degree, free from violent local draughts, and yet

subject to a continual gentle circulation. At the time when the observations now to

be noticed were made, there was no heating apparatus in the church : the lights used
were a few scattered tapers. The observations were made in the interval from April

8, 1808, to July 31, 1811. There is an interruption from April 27 to May 21, 1810,

owing to the absence of the observer, and a few single days are left without observa-
tion. From April 8, 1808, to July 12, 1808 (inclusive), the hour of observation is not
given. Afterwards it is given for each day, the hours varying from 11 to 5 ; the far
greater number are taken at about 1, and a sufficient proportion about 2 and 3, to render

the mean of the whole about 2 p.m., or nearly the epoch of maximum daily tempe-

rature in the open air. The observations are registered to half and one-fourth degrees,

and, as far as can be judged from inspection, appear to be very faithfully recorded.

--The following are the deductions: 1. The comparative mean annual temperature

within and without York Minster. 2. The comparative mean monthly temperature
of the interior of York Minster, and the mean monthly, and mean maximum monthly
temperature of the surrounding atmosphere. 3. The comparative epochs of mean

annual temperature for the same conditions.

--received the smaller proportionate quantity of rain, an unexpected result, which de-

serves confirmation. It appears also that the gauge inclined 45°, and turned to the
wind, received more rain than the horizontal gauge ; and that the quantity collected
in the globular gauge was about intermediate between that of the twelve-inch hori-
zontal and inclined funnels. From this Mr. Atkinson imagined, that its indications
were more nearly proportioned to the real quantity of rain than either of the others
hut it probably did not expose a sufficient arc (it should be 270°). Having pointed
out these circumstances affecting the true meaning of correctly-observed rain-registers,
Mr. Phillips drew attention to the importance, in all these inquiries, of a knowledge
of the angle of inclination of descending rain in each shower, and concluded by pro-
posing, as a fit general form of experimental research, so far as the mere question of
the quantity of rain falling through given sections of air at different heights was con-
cerned, that there should be placed in some very unexceptionably open situation a
series of gauges at different heights above the surface (0, 3, 6, 12, 24 French feet), of
three kinds at each height, viz. an ordinary/tt«neZ-gauge with horizontal edge ; a glo-
bular gauge ; an azimuth- and inclinatioH-ga.uge, such as was described by the Author,
and illustrated by figures in the account of the proceedings of the Section at Glasgow.

Letter from the late Capt. Hewett to Capt. Beaufort, R.N, (referred to in a

                              communication by Professor Whewell).

                                                           H.M. Ship Fair)-, Harwich, August 31st, 1840.

Sir,--On the 24th inst., being in lat. 52° 27' 30" N., long. 3° 14' 30" E.. with lig:ht

breezes and smooth water, I deemed it a fitting opportunity for making a further trial

on the rise and fall of tide in the middle of the North Sea ; and although I was then
many miles both to the northward and eastward of the spot near which Mr. Whewell

had previously expressed his wishes that the experiment should be made, yet I thought

that if good observations by any means could be obtained at the above position, they

would at the least serve to show, in some measure, the truth or error of that gentle-

man's theory                                                               either in the one case  by a sensible diminution of the vertical move-
                                                                        ;

ment of the tide, when compared with the known rise and fall on the shores of En-

gland and Holland, or in the other by ascertaining the rise and fall, beyond a doubt,

to be so great as to throw some doubt on the correctness of the theory in question.

But as I apprehend that Mr. Whewell's theory is founded mainly upon the fact, that

the tide waves, to make high water on the opposite coasts of England and Holland,

come from different directions, namely, on the former, round the northern extreme of

Great Britain, and so working its way along the eastern coast ; and on the latter,

through the straits of Dover, and running thence along the coasts of France, Belgium

and Holland ; and that it might reasonably be inferred, that these waves gradually

diminish in importance as they recede from their respective shores, or approach each

other, there would be left a broadish space about the middle of this part of the North

Sea, where no rise and fall of tide exists, and that therefore the waters between the

two opposite shores would assume a convex form at low water by the shores, and a

concave one at high water.

Allowing this view of the foundation of Mr. Whewell's theory to be correct, (and

I have not his book at present near me to refer to,) this line, or more properly speak-

ing, "broad belt" of no rise and fall, would doubtless run for a considerable distance

in the north-easterly direction into the North Sea, from the point where it may com-

mence on the North- Sea-side of the straits of Dover. It would therefore follow, that

the fact of my being to the northward of Mr. Whewell's position would of itself be

of nc material importance, and by reference to the Chart, it will be seen that the lon-

gitude places me not many miles to the eastward of the "broad belt" above alluded

to. Having thus reflected, I came to the conclusion, that if Mr. Whewell's views

were correct, true observations made in this position would exhibit some indications

thereof, and I accordingly made the necessary dispositions.

  A rise and fall by the shore is a case which falls immediately on the conviction, by
       TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                    33

the sense of sight ; but to ascertain the fact of a vertical motion of five or six feet in

the middle of a great sea, and out of sight of land, is a problem of no small difficulty,

and requires the exercise of many precautions to arrive at anything like true results.
In making an observation of this description we find two important obstacles in the way

of obtaining these, namely, the stream of tide and the undulating character of the sur-

face of the ground. Under the influence of a strong stream of tide, it is utterly im-

possible, exceptin very shallow water, to take a strictly correct depth from the vessel,

or a boat, at anchor, (and therefore a fixed point,) for the line wiiZ assume a curved form

in the act of descent; and after all, from the want of perpendicularity in the line, a

large allowance, in a depth of nearly twenty fathoms, is necessarily left to the exercise

of the judgment ; and both of these may amount to considerably more than the " rise

and fall" sought for. On the other hand, the undulations of the surface render it

essential that the depths should be always taken over some discoveredelevated spot.

The stream of tide and the undulations of the ground are therefore alternately opposed

to the making of observations from which correct results can be derived. I experi-

enced on this, as on the former occasion, considerable difficulty in overcoming these

obstacles ; but I soon found myself compelled to resort to the former plan, (with the

addition of such precautions as experience then gave me,) namely, that of mooring

one boat and taking the depths in another.

  The accompanying diagram will assist my account of the plan pursued.

   The ship was anchored in 21| fathoms, and on searching, a convenient rise in the

Aground was soon found near her, over which there was exactly 18 fathoms 3 feet,

by a well-measured line. The second gig (of 26 feet) was then moored, " head and

stern," in the direction of the strength of the stream (N.E. and S.W.), so that she

should be as nearly as possible over the overfall A. This was accomplished thus :

I prepared a coil of If inch rope, and fastened a grapnel at either end. The first

grapnel was let go at B, the whole of the line was then veered away, and the second

grapnel was let go at C ; the gig was hauled along the bight of the rope, until it was

found, by repeated trial, that the summit of the overfall was exactly abreast the fore-

mast row-lock of figure D, at about six feet from the boat, while the N.E. stream was

running. She was there secured. At the turn of the tide to the S.W., it was found

that the weight of the stream F had operated so powerfully on the bight of the N.E.

Dline, as to draw the boat from to E, so that the summit of the overfall, which was

before under the foremost row-lock, was found to be eight feet on her bow. On the

return of the N.E. tide, its operation (G) upon the bight of the S.W. line again drew

the gig ahead to her former position D, and the summit of the overfall was found as

before under the foremost row-lock.

It will then be evident, that at each change of tide I knew exactly where the over-

fall was to be found, while taking the depths ; and thus prepared, it only remained

to get the least and exact vertical depth over the summit of the overfall at the inter-

vals determined upon, and which were every half-hour. With the N.E. stream

running, I dropped the lead from the other gig about the point H, and exactly in

the stream, which I knew would drift her at the proper distance of six feet from the

moored boat ; the lead was constantly lifted off the ground, so that the line was

perfectly straight and perpendicular, and the undulations of the ground carefully

observed until the lead passed over the summit of the overfall, where the depths

were strictly noticed, and recorded in the accompanying Table. The boat on this

stream was allowed to drift to the point I. With the S.W. stream I began about

the point I and terminated at H, using the same observances and precautions until

5h. 30m. p. M. of the 25th, when the appearance of the weather required my removing.

     It will be seen that the observations recorded on the afternoon of the 24th are not
so regular as those of the following day. I attribute this to some degree of uncer-
tainty on account of a long swell, perhaps of one and a half or two feet rise, inter-

rupting the observation at the moment of passing over the overfall ; but this little
swell had nearly subsided on the 25th, and the depths were then recorded with much
satisfaction. It will also be noticed, that at the turn of the stream about noon of
the latter day, the depth had increased to eighteen fathoms four feet, and went on
uniformly so ; but I investigated the cause of this on the spot, and found that the

wind having increased to 2 from W. by S., and therefore operating upon the star-
board bow of the boat, had sidled her a few feet to the S.E., so as to bring the

eighteen fathoms three feet immediately under her; and that by observing the same
distance from the boat while drifting past her (and which was always on her lar-

board side), I obtained eighteen fathoms four feet instead of eighteen fathoms three

feet.

   From the care and pains taken in these observations, and that under favourable

circumstances, I do not entertain a doubt of the correctness of any one of the depths
over the summit of the overfall as recorded on the 25th ; but as this interesting

result of observations on an unexpected theory may no doubt give rise to a strong
desire for further observations as corroboratives, I shall not fail to make such when

I find myself in a position and circumstances to do so with any prospect of success.
It is a difficult observation, and can be made but seldom. In the mean time I

would offer my congratulations to Mr. Whewell on these results, should they prove

in any degree gratifying to him. I have the honour to be, &c.

On a Machine for Calculating the Numerical Values of Definite Integrals.

  By the Rev. Henry Moseley, M.A., F.R.S., Professor of Natural Phi-

   losophy and Astronomy in King's College, London.

    It is the object of this machine to apply to the mechanical integration of an exten-

sive class of functions, a principle suggested by M. Poncelet for the registration of
dynamometrical admeasurements, and subsequently applied by M. Morin to an in-
strument called the Compteur, for registering the work or dynamical effect expended
in the traction of loaded carriages upon common roads, and by a Committee of this

Association (whose Report is contained in the present volume) to a permanent regis-
tration of the work of the steam upon the piston of a steam-engine. Professor
Moseley stated his integrating machine to have some mechanical expedients in com-

mon with the last-mentioned machine, but to have nothing in common with the
Compteur of M. Morin, except the fruitful and admirable principle of M. Poncelet.

    It consists of a circular plate or disc placed in a horizontal position, and moveable

Aabout an axis passing through its centre. wheel, which, from the function assigned

to it. Professor Moseley calls the integrating wheel ofhis machine, is placed in a vertical
position with its edges resting upon the superior surface of this plate, and with its
axis (i. e. a line passing through its centre perpendicular to its plane) in a vertical
plane passing through the centre of the plane. It is made to retain this vertical po-
sition, and at the same time to admit of a motion across the plate on which it rests,
in the direction of a diameter, by the intervention of a guide composed of three par-
allel rods passing through three holes at corresponding points in the three arms of
the integrating wheel and fixed at their extremities firmly into two discs, which discs
are moveable about axes passing through their centres, these horizontal axes having
their bearings in two pieces which admit of a vertical motion by means of keyed
grooves in guides fixed vertically to the solid frame on which the plate rests ; so that
the whole weight of the frame and integrating wheel is borne by that point in the cir-
cumference of the latter by which it rests on the plate : the frame composed of the
three parallel rods, and the discs into which they are fixed, is perfectly rigid, and is
carried round by the revolutions of the integrating wheel ; and the axes about which
it turns being in a vertical plane passing through the centre of the plate, the frame

                                        d2
36 KEPORT 1841.

serves as a guide along which that wheel maj* be made to traverse in the direction of

a diameter of the plate, retaining always its position in a plane perpendicular to it.

One of the axes about which the frame turns is hollow, and through it a rod passes

to the centre of the integrating wheel, through which it passes, being so attached to

it (by means of a shoulder and nut) that the integrating wheel may turn freely on its
extremity, whilst any motion communicated to it in the direction of its length may

cause the wheel to move along the frame or its point of contact with the circular plate

to traverse one of its diameters. This rod is fixed firmly at its other extremity to a

short vertical piece, which connects it with another rod returning parallel to the first

between it and the plate, and passing through an aperture in the same piece (sliding

in vertical grooves) in which the hollow axis of the first-mentioned frame is fixed,

until  it nearly reaches                      the  integrating wheel                                                                                 its  extremity is  there  turned down-
                                                                                                                                                  ;

wards at a right angle until it just touches the surface of the plate. On the surface

of the plate is elevated a curved edge or rail of a certain geometrical form, determined

by the particular function which the machine is intended to integrate ; and against the
edge of this rail that small portion of the extremity of the last-mentioned rod which

is turned downwards, is kept continually pressed by means of a spring acting against

the vertical piece which forms the extremity of the frame composed of the two par-

allel bars, and which was last described.

The circular plate has teeth cut upon its edge, and is made to revolve horizontally

by means of an endless screw fixed to the frame on which the plate rests, and thus

revolving it carries round the integrating wheel by reason of the friction produced

between its surface and the edge of that wheel by the weight which rests upon the

latter, and is supported at their common point of contact ; whilst the integrating
wheel is thus made to revolve, its point of contact with the plate is made (at the same

time) to traverse in the direction of a diameter to the plate, by the continued pres-

sure of the edge of the curved rail on the extremity of the lower rod of the last de-

scribed frame of two parallel rods ; the whole of that frame, and therefore the upper
of the two rods which compose it, being made by that pressure (the rail not being a

circle concentric with the plate) to move in the direction of its length, and the inte-

grating wheel to which the upper rod is attached being thereby made to slide along

the first-described frame, which frame at the same time it carries round by the wheel.

  Now it is evident that the point of contact of the integrating wheel with the plate

being thus made to alter its position on a diameter of the latter continually by the

pressure of the rail, as the plate to which it is affixed is made to revolve, the geo-

metrical law of this change of position must be dependent upon the polar equation

to the curve of the rail from the centre of the plate, or upon the relation of its radius

vector (the centre of the plate being taken as the pole) to the angle which that fine

makes with any line given in position and dmwn through the centre of the plate.
  Now let it be conceived that such a geometrical form is given to the curved edge

of the rail as to cause the distance of the point of contact of the wheel and plate from

the centre of the latter to be a given function /(^) of the angle 6 described by the
plate from any given position. The integrating wheel thus continually varying its dis-

tance from the centre of the plate, and its circumference continually revolving with the
motion of that part of the surface of the plate with which it is in contact, it follows
that the number of revolutions, and parts of a revolution, which are made by it, and
therefore by the frame which it carries with it as the plate evolves from any given an-

gular position 6\ to any other 6.2, is represented by the definite integral

                                                   f{6)dd.

For the distance of the point of contact of the integrating wheel and plate from the

centre of the latter being represented by f{6), it is evident that, whilst the exceed-

Aingly small but finite increment ^ of the angle 6 is described by the plate about its

centre, its point of contact with the wheel is made to describe an arc represented

                                           .  ^ ; so that if in any position of the integrating wheel its distance from

Athe centre of the plate be supposed to remain imchanged\y\i\\%t the small angle ^ is

described by the plate, the circumference of that wheel will be made to describe a

space represented by the same quantity f{0).A&; and that the sum of all such spaces

described on the same supposition, in respect to other positions of the integrating

wheel or other values of the function /(^) between the hmits ^j and 6^, will be repre-

sented by the sum                     ^i

                                2/(^.A^.

If, therefore, the broken or interrupted variation here supposed to be given to the

distance of the point of contact from the centre of the plate (and which may be con-

ceived to be communicated by a jagged or step-like form of the edge of the rail) be
replaced by the continuous variation actually communicated to it by the curve, this

sum will pass into the definite integral*

            L 'f{6).d6.

Now Nif represent the number of revolutions and decimal parts'of a revolution de-

scribed by the frame or integrating wheel, and ^ the radius of that wheel, the sum
(or whole space described by the circumference of the wheel round its axis) is re-
presented by the product 2 sr g N. So that

   Let now a contrivance be applied to the instrument for registering the revolutions

N of the frame, and therefore of the integrating wheel, to the 10,000th part, or to four

places of decimals. This registration may be made by the common method of as-

tronomical instruments ; or more conveniently, and perhaps with sufficient accuracy,
by means of a toothed wheel fixed on the axis of the frame, and running into a
pinion in the proportion of 10 to 1 : this pinion carrying a wheel which runs into a
second pinion in the same proportion, and so on through a train of wheels and
pinions, each wheel of which being divided into 10 equal parts, and numbered, will
show one digit of the decimal part of a revolution up to as many places of decimals

as there are wheels. The complete revolutions of the frame may in like manner be

registered by means of a pinion on the axis of the frame running into a wheel in the

Nproportion of 1 to 10. The value of may thus be registered to four places of de-

cimals.

  --Professor Moseley then proceeded to show 1st, that if the edge of the rail had

the form of a straight line, or rather a curve, so slightly deviating from a straight
line as to give to the point of contact the same motion as that point would receive
from a straight line fixed upon the revolving plate, and actually passing through that
point, and if the perpendicular distance a of this line from the centre were such that

       := "43429, and if the registration commence from that position of the plate in

which the rail is perpendicular to the diameter traversed by its point of contact with
the wheel, then will the number registered be represented by the formula

                            N=log,{tan(-l-+i-)}

So that when a straight rail is thus fixed upon the plate, the machine may be made

to calculate the logarithmic tangent of any arc of the quadrant, and to replace a

table of logarithmic tangents.

2nd. That if the edge of the rail were a circle whose circumference passed through

the centre of the plate, and whose radius was equal to t q, and if the angle 6 were

measured from that position in which the diameter of this circle coincided with the

line traversed by the point of contact, then would the number registered be repre-

sented by the formula           N = -a'
                                      i.,
                                sm 0.

So that with this form of rail the machine would serve to calculate mechanically the
natural sines of angles, and to replace a table of such sines.

    3rd. That if the edge of the rail were a curve slightly differing from an ellipse
having its centre in c, and such that the point of contact of the plate and integrating
wheel might be made to move precisely as it would if guided by the actual pressure

of an elliptic edge, and e be taken to represent the ratio of the eccentricity of this
=ellipse to its axis major, and if its semi-axis minor be taken  2 « g, then will the

number registered be represented by the formula

             N= M ^^ .

                      y --Vl e^sin^tf

So that the machine may be made with this rail to calculate an elliptic function of
the first order of any amplitude 6 whose modulus is e.

   4th. That if the form of the rail were that of a logarithmic spiral whose pole co-
incided with the centre of the plate, and y representing the constant angle of the
spiral and a the radius vector from which was measured, if these quantities were

so taken that ?i?fL2'= i and £*^°*^= 10, then would the numbers registered be

                            2 7rq

represented by the formula  j^ i j __ jq^.

N +The arc & is therefore the logarithm of the number  1 greater than that regis-

tered by unity ; and if, connected with the endless screw which gives motion to the

plate, there be a train of wheels registering the space described by a point in the

plate at distance unit)' from its centre to four places of decimals, and beginning from

that position of the plate in which the given radius vector a coincides with the dia-

meter described by the point of contact of the plate and wheel, then when the regis-

ter which gives the revolutions of the integrating wheel is made to show one less

any given number N, that which gives the revolution of the plate will show a number

Nwhich is the common logarithm of ; so that under this form the machine may be

made to replace a table of common logarithms. The surface of the plate might in

this particular case be advantageously replaced by the surface of a cone, and the

spiral would then become identical with the natural spiral traced out by the convo-
lution of a large class of turbinated shells*. The preceding examples of the calcu-

lations which may be performed by the machine are examples whose solutions lie

within the ordinary resources of analysis, in respect to which the instrument could
only serve to replace, perhaps conveniently, but (except it were constructed on a large
scale) less accurately, well known processes of analytical calculation or tables already

in use.

   Professor Moseley next proceeded to show that there is a large class of func-
tions whose analytical integration lies beyond the existing resources of mathema-
tical science, the mechanical integration of which this machine would nevertheless

effect. He then stated, that among the mechanical difficulties which would present

themselves to the construction of such a machine were the following. Great accu-
racy would be required in giving their true geometrical forms to the curves fixed
upon the revolving plate. It is unquestionable that a certain amount of error must
always remain due to inaccuracies of workmanship in the forms of these curves

nevertheless to those who are acquainted with the wonderful education of the sense

of touch and skill of hand acquired in the minute workmanship of some processes of

the arts, (the engraving of tj'pe-founders' dies for instance, or the drawing of micro-

metrical lines on glass,) it will not appear impossible to reach, with the requisite care
and patience, a very considerable degree of precision in this respect ; and let it be

remembered, that one type or model being thus attained, it may be reproduced infi-

nitely, and with perfect accuracy, by casting in type-founders' metal, or perhaps by

turning, or by the electrotj'pe. Again, the difficulty of constructing these curv'es

would, no doubt, in some degree be enhanced by the fact, that the guiding curve

must be different from what it would be if the integrating wheel at its point of con-

tact with the plate were allowed to be in contact with the face of the rail. This difficulty

the curves from the plate, and to place them on another circular plate parallel to and

    * This property of turbinated shells was published by Prof. Moseley in a paper on the Geo-
metrical Forms of Turbinated and Discord Shells in the Phil. Trans, for 1838. It lias since been
confirmed by the admeasurements of Prof. Naumann, of Friburg, published in the Journal
of Poggendorff for 1840.

the integrating wheel ; and then to give to the connecting piece of the two parallel

rods a direction upwards instead of downwards, so that the second bar may pass to

the superior surface of the upper plate ; if this bar be then precisely of the length of

the first, the point of contact will be made to describe a path on the lower plate
precisely similar to the guiding point of the rail on the upper. There are, however,
some important applications of the instrument, in which the curve admitting of an
easy mechanical description, the guidance of a rail may be entirely dispensed with,
the point of contact being made to vary its position according to the required law,

by some more convenient or more accurate mechanical expedient ; of this class are

the eUipse and the logarithmic spiral.

On a Neio Calculating Machine. By Mr. Fowler.

The machine i.tself is on the principle of the old abacus, or calculating rods. At

the first glance it has somewhat the appearance of a pianoforte, or organ, with all
its keys laid bare. It would be impossible by mere description to make clear the de-
tails of the instrument, or the method of working it. The property of numbers on
which Mr. Fowler bases the notation of his machine is, that any number whatever

may be expressed by a proper combination of the powers of the number 3. The

powers of 3 are in succession thus : the power is 1 ; 1st, 3 ; 2nd, 9 ; 3rd, 11 ; 4th,

81 ; 5th, 243 ; &c. &c. Thus the number 14 may be expressed by subtracting
from 27, or the 3rd power, the sum of 9, 3, and 1, the 2nd, 1st, and powers, and

similarly for all other numbers ; the combination for some being more simple, for

others more compUcated. Instead of using the nine common characters with 0,

nought, or zero, as in our common mode of numbering, Mr. Fowler only uses three

+ --marks, when the power of 3 is to be added, when it is to be subtracted ; and
the power itself is expressed by the place in which the mark stands : thus the num-
--ber 14 would be H
                  , where the most to the right means that the power
--of zero, or 1, is to be subtracted; the next to the left means, that the 1st power

of 3 is also to be subtracted ; the next, that the 2nd power of 3 is to be subtracted,

and the -\- in the 4th place of figures means, that the 4th power of 3 is to be added.

When any power belonging to any rank or place is not required in expressing any
--particular number, occupies the place of either -|- or
                                                                in that place of the com-

+0 --bination of characters for the number : thus               +h would express 243 1,

diminished by 3 and 27, or 214, to express which, the 3rd power of three, or 9, is

not required ; the then in the third place expresses this, and yet gives the proper

--value to the , 0, and +, in the 4th, 5th and 6th places. Arithmetical operations

are performed by the aid of these simple marks with all the rapidity and security of

the simplest algebraic processes, and pretty much in accordance with the well-known

algebraic rules : thus to add 214 and 14 the process would be thus :

                  214 or +0 --                               h

   The translation of a given number into the ternary combination of signs suited to
express it, requires the aid of voluminous tables, which may perhaps be simplified.

  --In the machine, the successive rods have the power of the number that would be

expressed by a +, or , or 0, in the place in which the brass nail appears. The

--range of the machine is greatly extended by the use of the lines parallel to the zero

line, for thus 3 +'s or 4 's may be in succession placed by the rod being carried
down 3 lines or up 3 lines, and thus additions and subtractions are performed by the
very motions which work the rods in the processes of multiphcation and division.
The extent of power of the machine will be conceived if we consider that 7 +'s fol-
lowed by 480 can be set on the machine, and would represent the number

          Letter from Sir John F. W. Herschel, dated July 31, 1841.

 --Sir, Allow me to requ'est that you will submit to the inspection of the Physical

Section of the British Association the annexed specimens (fifteen in number) of
coloured Photographic copies of engravings and mezzotintos, into the preparation of
which no metallic ingredient enters, the whole being tinted with substances of vege-

table origin variously prepared.

   The rays of the spectrum which have eaten away the lights in these Photographs,
are neither the so-called chemical rays beyond the violet, nor the calorific rays be-
yond the red. The action is confined almost entirely to the luminous rays, and of
these more especially to those rays of the spectrum whose colour is most contrasted
with, or which enter most sparingly into, the composition of the ground tint
a circumstance which, considering the great command of colour which this new

variety of the photographic art affords, holds out no slight hope of a solution
of the problem of a photographic representation of natural objects in their proper

colours.

    Unwilling to occupy the time of the Section so near its conclusion, I pretermit
for the present all details of manipulation, and remain.

                                                                               Sir, yours very obediently,

       On Daltonism, By Professor Elie Wartmann of Lausanne.

   Of all the organs of sense with which man has been provided, none is more deli-
cate than that of vision : it is subject also to a great number of affections, the study

of which is important in the highest degree both to the physicist and to the physio-
logist. One of the most remarkable of these affections is an incomplete vision of
colourp, which has been called Daltonism, from the name of the illustrious philoso-

pher of Manchester, who first described it in an exact manner.
   As the various treatises and scientific collections contain merely scattered data on

this peculiarity of vision, it appeared to me that it would be interesting to collect together

all the authentic materials for its history which have hitherto been pubhshed, for the
purpose of comparing them with the results of new observations, and of being en-

abled, finally, to assign a common origin to all the varieties of this disease of vision.

1 extract from a work of considerable extent the following conclusions, which appear

to me to generalize the known facts on the subject, and to agree with others which

still remain unpublished.

    1. There are two distinct classes of Dalf onions, viz. the dichromatic, who can only
discern two colours, commonly black and white, and who appear to be endowed

with a remarkable faculty of seeing in comparative darkness ; and the polychromatic,

composed of individuals who perceive at least three colours normally.

    2. Daltonism is not always an hereditary affection, nor does it always date from

the birth. It appears in certain infants born of parents who possess ordinary vision,

and independently of the order of birth and of sex.

   3. Deep colours appear black to many of these persons, unless they are illuminated

by a bright light.
    4. The number of colours perceived in the spectrum by polychromatic Daltonians
TRANSACTIONS OF THK SECTIONS.                                             41

is not constant ; some of them see three only, others four (among which blue and
red may be specially mentioned). The extreme colours, red and violet, are frequently

not distinct to them. This latter fact appears to me to be intimately connected with

the question as to the number of primary colours {couleurs elementaires)
   5. The degree of polish of the coloured surface exerts an influence on the appre-

ciation of its colour.

   6. Some Daltonians perceive both the brightness and the coloration of comple-
mentary tints which are invisible to us.

   7. Two colours, which appear to our eyes to pass into each other by a succession

of intermediate tints, appear to them [Daltonians] in contrast with one another.
   8. Daltonians see exactly as we do the black rays [spaces] discovered in the spec-

trum by Frauenhijfer, at least in that portion of the spectrum which to them appears

illuminated.

   9. Those colours which we call complementary do not always appear such to them ;
and conversely, the tints which they designate as complementary to those which they

perceive, are not such to our vision.
    It is remarkable that the subject of Daltonism appears to have been studied by the

English only ; for, with the exception of the works of Dr. Jiincher and Prof. Seebeck,'
it is difficult to refer to any researches on this subject but those of Englishmen. I shall
be happy if by this notice I shall have excited physiologists and physicians to make

new observations on the subject, and I shall receive with acknowledgement any which
may be communicated to me.

On the application of a Coating of Gold hy the Electro-metallurgic process to

Bythe Steel Balance-springs of Chronometers.                 E. J. Dent.

It is customary to " blue the balance-spring " in chronometers, and the blue oxy-

genated surface (or coating) greatly increases the elastic force of the spring ; on its

removal the balance-spring suffers a nearly corresponding loss. This rigid oxyge-

nated coating, on its first formation by heat, increases the strength of the balance-

spring more than the additional application of the gold on its surface ; and while
it may be considered as a first process of rust, the gold surface is a protection from

the ill effects of damp and saline atmospheres, to which chronometers are subject on

ship-board, and particularly in tropical climates. Mr. Dent first applied the gold to

a chronometer balance-spring which had been previously rated ; on its being replaced

in the chronometer he found the rate of the chronometer to be losing 4 1 seconds ia

24 hours, which was caused by the removal of the blue oxygenated surface, and the

gold coating not increasing the elastic force so as to compensate for the loss. Mr.

Dent in another paper communicated the result of his experiments on the glass ba-

lance-spring in chronometers, since his first communication made to the Association

at Cambridge in 1833, with observations on its official rate, resulting from five years*

trial by order of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.

On the Preservation of Magnetic Needles and Bars from Oxidation by the

ByElectrotype process.  Professor Christie.

   The author stated that the preservation of the identity of magnetic needles and bars
employed in determining the terrestrial magnetic intensity, whether statically or dy-
namically, both as regards their magnetism and their weight, is so evident, that it
was quite unnecessary for him to dwell upon the subject ; but he might mention, that
even in the case of the ruder instruments employed-- as ships' compasses, it had been
considered by experienced naval officers that it would be advantageous if the needles

were efficiently protected from oxidation. On learning that the electrotype process

had been applied by Mr. Dent to the protection of the balance-springs of chrono-
meters, by forming a coat of pure gold on their surface, it occurred to him that
the same process was admirably adapted for protecting magnetic bars and needles

from oxidation. He now presented to the Section two needles, which, after having
been magnetized, were coated with gold by this process. He considered that the

same process could be advantageously applied to the protection of the axes of dip-
ping needles : this however was a question which could only be decided by careful
experiment, as it was very possible that the coating of soft gold on the axis might
--42 REPORT 1841.

 so much increase the friction on the agate planes, as to render the application of

 the process in this part of the needle objectionable.

    The needles presented are of clock spring, and were magnetized in the ordinary
 way, by double touch, previously to being subjected to the electro-metallic process.
 Their weights before they had received the coating of gold were 225*4 grains and
 222*1 grains, and afterwards 227'8 grains and 223'8 respectively; so that the coat-
 ing of gold on the one is 2*4 grains, and on the other 1'7 grain. Previously to

the application of this process of gilding, it is quite necessary that the surface of the
needle should be well polished, and perfectly clean. Professor Christie remarked,
that in the specimens before the Section, which were first attempts, in consequence
of defect in the polish, the process had failed in particular points. This arose from his

desire that the original surface of these particular needles should not be much
rubbed down ; but the defect is one which with due care and attention may easily be

avoided. These needles still retained a considerable degree of magnetism, but this
was greatly increased on their being re-magnetized by means of two bar magnets,
then on the table.

On the Use of the Sliding Rule, with an account of some New Lines pro-
                         posed for it. By J. Bateman.

   This communication, which was illustrated by a sliding-rule with a radius of
eight feet, the largest size yet graduated, embraced notices of the ordinary lines on a
sliding-rule ; the application of these to cask-gauging, by the use of a mean diameter,
calculated or obtained by peculiar graduations on the rule ; the proposal of Dr.
Young and others, to obtain the contents of casks by one setting of the rule, with-
out the previous finding of a mean ; the causes why these attempts have been un-
successful ; and a description of the line of special gauge points, lately invented by
Mr. WooUgar of Lewes (which required a double setting of the rule). The author
stated, that all that is wanted by the practical cask-gauger is the completion of Dr.
Young's lines, applied to casks of a spheroidal form, i. e. a graduation for finding the
contents of such casks at one setting of the rule.

   On Determining Distances hy the Telescope. By Edmund Bowman.

   Instead of a graduated scale in the common focus of the eye-glass and object-glass,
and a fixed measure held at an unknown (but limited) distance, the author advo-
cates the employment of a fixed interval in the common focus of the eye-glass and

object-glass, and a graduated staff held at the point whose distance is required to be
known. This method he fully developes and describes, and by a very simple pro-
cess makes the requisite correction for the varying distances from the object-glass
of images which are derived from unequal distances from the observer. The author
is of opinion, that, with suitable instruments and with adequate attention, observa-

tions may be made which shall give the distances truly to the one-thousandth part.

                        CHEMISTRY.

Some Inquiries into the Causes of the increased Destructihility of Modern

              Copper Sheathing. By J. Prideaux, F.G.S.

   On the 29th of May last year, the author had been requested by Mr. Owen, of H.M.

Dockyard, to analyse some sheet copper from the sheathing of the Sanspareil, which
was still in good condition after thirty years' wear. The sample gave about 0'25 per
cent, of alloy, chiefly tin, zinc and iron (see Table I.). This contrasted with an-
other sample, quickly worn out, and which had given no quantity of alloy sufficient
to weigh. These instances coincided with two recorded analyses of Sir H. Davy

and Mr. R. Phillips, the former having detected in a sample of very durable sheath-
ing about 1 ·400th of tin ; the latter having found one which had lasted hardly four
years, the purest copper he had ever analysed ; and further, with the reputed in-
feriority of the recently prepared sheathing of the Royal Navy, which must have

been much purified by repeated fusions.
   The inference was, that the presence of tin and zinc was favourable to the dura-

bility of the copper ; not perhaps from any advantage in the alloy, but as a guarantee
of the absence of suboxide, which melted copper was liable to dissolve in refining,
but which could hardly be supposed to coexist with zinc and tin : and nothing

could be more injurious to the durability of the copper than being thus penetrated

with oxygen, which must facilitate the action of the sea water, mechanically as well

as chemically.

   To bring this inference to the test of direct comparison, four other samples were

submitted to analysis.

1. From the Minden, worn 17 years, annual loss 0'45 per cent.

2. ,, Plover, ,, 5 ,,                    ,, 11          ,,

added, to quicken the action without affecting the neutrality. The following table
shoWs the effects.

Here the greatest waste was on the Sanspareil's copper, the most durable of all

in actual wear ; and the least that of the Plover, one of those which had suffered

most rapidly. Placed under like circumstances, the ratio of waste is quite different

from that in use ; which should therefore be more or less due to external conditions.

These may depend on the relations of the copper to the ship, or on the circumstances

of her employment. The upper edge and parts most subject to the wash of the sea,

and to air and froth, suffer most from friction, as well as chemical action. The

lower part wears much less when in deep water ; but when the vessel grounds at
low water in black mud, this part suffers most, from the action of sulphuretted hy-

drogen. The nails by which it is fastened to the ship can hardly be without their

influence. They are never made of pure copper ; are very numerous, all in metallic

contact with the sheets, their heads presenting also a large metallic surface to the

salt water, so as to give great effect to sUght electro-chemical differences. Such
effects had been very apparent on the Jane, whose copper had been worn out in four
years ; round some of the nails the copper being sound for an inch or two, although
worn ragged in other parts, whilst the converse effect was exhibited round other
nails, as though some had acted protectively, others destructively. Some instances
were exhibited upon the table.

   All the nails he had tried, though alloyed with tin and other electro-positive metals,
were electro-negative to copper whilst clean, though assuming the electro-positive
relation to it when crusted with verdigris, and the copper clean.

   To ascertain their operation in these respects, five slips of new copper from the
same sheet, and of the same size as above (4 X 0'5 in.), marked 0. i. ii. in. X, were
suspended equidistant, and at the same depth, in a vessel of sea- water from the West
Indies. 0. was unconnected ; i. n. in. X . were each in metallic contact with a nail,

driven tight into a hole punched in the copper, the nails being taken from four dif-

ferent samples. After twelve days they were taken out and reweighed, withdrawing

the nails ; the following are the results :

All the nails, except one (which was from H-M. Dockyard), seem to have acted

destructively. No. 3. having been one of those which had exhibited the same in-

dications on Mr. Moore's ship Jane, quoted above.

Here appears to be one instance of a protective nail ; not enough so to prevent all

waste of the copper, which experience has not shown to be desirable ; but doubtless
the preservative power may be increased to any requisite degree by attending to the

composition of the alloy, as will be presently explained.

 --The waste due to the ships' employment may be owing, 1. to excess of work;

2. to stress of weather, including electrical discharges; 3. to the effects of climate
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

4. to corrosive materials in the different waters.

As the sheathing suffers from friction as well as from chemical action, the more

the ship is at sea the greater will be her waste by friction ; the more also will she

be subject to stress of weather, which will act in the same way, and to electrical

discharges, which will excite chemical action.

The Plover and Linnet, being packets, were very likely to have suffered from these

causes (see Table I.) : and the Acorn, which had undergone much thunder and

--lightning on the African coast, had lost of her copper 16 per cent, in 2^ j'ears.
   Climate. That the sheathing suffers most in hot climates, is only what might

--have been expected from the usual increase of chemical action with the temperature.
    Corrosive waters. Did this property of heat, and also its tendency to promote

organic production and decomposition, render the tropical waters more corrosive ?
                                                      TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                        45

The copper from the Plover and from the Jane, near the water-line, which was spotted

with uniform punctures in the shape of a horse-shoe, with a trail running invariably

in the direction of the wash, looked as if damaged by organic action. The specimens

were shown on the table. This appearance did not descend below the reach of air

or froth.

    To examine the question of increased corrosive power in tropical waters, Mr. Owen

undertook to obtain samples from the Gulf-stream and other points ; as well as from
Falmouth harbour, where the packets are moored. Meanwhile appeared Professor

Daniell's announcement of the large quantities of sulphuretted hydrogen in the

waters of the Guinea coast.

    The samples were collected and ticketed with due care : four from the Gulf-stream,

one including the weed                                                                                       two from the Caribbean Sea off Barbadoes ;                                                    one from Fal-
                                                                                                          ;

all required nearly the same proportions of chloride of barium to precipitate the

sulphuric acid (No. 4, of course, excepted), and of carbonate of soda to throw down

the earths.

   To try the action of these different waters, five copper slips of the dimensions above

(4 X 0-5 inch), cut from the same sheet, were suspended in a pint each of the fol-

lowing samples of water:-- 1. Heart of the Gulf-stream. 2. The same, with the

weed. 3. Caribbean Sea. 4. Falmouth harbour. 5. Plymouth harbour. After

thirteen days they were taken out and reweighed, having been put in all bright,

but cleaned, on taking out, only with a brush in soft water, as in the other experi-
ments ;--

   Nos. 1. 3. 4 and 5. were placed in a hot-house window, to assimilate to a hot
climate. No. 2. being too offensive for this place, was put just beneath an unceiled
southern roof, where the heat and light were inferior to the others. But the Very

small comparative waste of metal in this instance seems to be due to a pellicle on
the liquid, constantly renewing after being stirred down. It seems to indicate more

destructive action from the air and salt water than from sulphuretted hydrogen. No.
1. came out clean and bright; the others with tarnished surfaces, except No. 2,
which was blotchy and speckled.

    These experiments require to be repeated. The Falmouth water presented no in-

dications  of being                                   more  corrosive                                        than  that  of Plymouth                                                             and  the  great difference of
                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

waste in these two cases may be due to some unobsei-ved difference of conditions.

The excessive action of the Gulf-stream water can hardly thus be explained ; not only

the quantity wasted, but the metaUic cleanness of the surface, show a manifest dis-

tinction.

    But to whatever extent the recently increased waste of sheathing may be charged

upon the greater velocity, more constant employment, and greater consequent liabi-

lities of weather and climate of our shipping, particularly of the commercial class, as

well as to difference in the nails, there is reason to fear the fault is still to be sought,

too often, in the copper itself. The Quarantine Cutter, generally at anchor in Cat-

water, was coppered in October 1832, and her copper is now in a very good state.

Her last sheathing held good fourteen years. The Eddystone tender, which also

moors in Catwater, was coppered in July 1838, and is now in much worse condition

than the Quarantine, which has been on service six years longer. That the waste on

the Eddystone tender is not owing to her work, appears from the fact that her water-

hne, which suffers the wash and friction, continues sound (from a cause to be pre-

sently explained); the damage going oa below, where the copper peels off in blue

flakes. That .this is attributable, in great degree, to her occasionally grounding upon

the black mud, which generates sulphuretted hydrogen and other corrosive matters,

is  very   probable                                   the other never grounds, and does less work.                                                                                                         Yet the difference
                                                   ;

is ^ery great to be thus accounted for ; the one being in good condition after nine

years' wear, the other coming to patch at the end of three. On neither was there

any mark of electro-chemical action by the nails. The Tartar frigate, again, had her

copper almost destroyed in four years, though never out of Sheerness harbour ; and
--46 REPORT 1841.

in such a case, where enough attention was paid to the subject to have the copper

analysed, it might be supposed that so extensive an action from the nails could hardly
have passed unnoticed. The author hoped yet to obtain some of the copper from the
Quarantine and Eddystone tenders, and other samples from consistent instances,which

should fix the fault upon the copper itself. Comparative analysis may then discover

methods both to manufacture and to distinguish the sheet-copper best suited for this

important purpose. Meanwhile, as nails must be used, advantage may be taken of

their electro-chemical protection, by making them slightly positive to'copper. The

  addition of zinc for this purpose need not injure their flexibility nor enhance their

' price. They are now alloyed chieflfy with tin ; but the care of the manufacturer is
 to make them sufficiently hard and flexible, without much regard to the presence of

other metals. If they were made just so much electro-positive as to protect the

sheathing so far as is compatible with their own durability, they would seem to offer
the simplest, most perfect, and most convenient mode of electro-chemical protection.
The test by the galvanometer would be easily applied (after a little practice) in
making up the metal, if it be important to continue the present system of their ma-

nufacture.

A different method of preservation came out in the course of these investigations,

which has since been made the subject of some probably conflicting patents.

It was above noticed, that the upper part of the copper on the Eddystone tender,

which bears the wash and friction of the waves, continues sound ; whilst the bottom

is fast wearing out. This exception, or rather subversion of the usual conditions, is

owing to a coating of fish-oil, laid on when the copper was new, to keep it bright,

and not extended over the parts out of sight. Such a permanent effect could never

have been anticipated from an oil which is not drying ; and strongly indicates the

Afacility, as well as efficacy, of this mode of protection.                                 still more striking case

presented itself in the vessel which supplied the observations on the apparent influ-

ence of the nails. During the examination of her copper, Mr. Moore called his at-

tention to the complete preservative effect of some coal-tar, which had trickled over

the copper from the wood-work above. This had crossed the sheets where most
subject to the wash and friction ; and whilst the naked metal had been quite worn
away, the coal-tarred streaks remained entire ; the surface of the copper, on melting

off the tar, being as perfect as when fresh from the rolls. The specimen was shown
on the table.

   Hence coal-tar seems to be an efficient preservative; but then recurs the question
which encumbers this subject--will it keep a clean surface, free from organic ad-

hesions and earthy incrustations ?--the solution of which can be obtained only from

time and experiment.

   To embrace the opportunity for both, the vessel was then sheathed with copper
on one side and yellow metal on the other ; and her fore- quarters to her midlength

varnished with coal-tar, laid on hot upon the metal, also heated by fires of chips

round the sides. She has now been twelve months at sea, and by the last account of

her, the varnished as well as the metallic surfaces kept quite clean. In the present

stage of this investigation, Mr. Prideaux had not found the difference between durable

and perishable samples of sheathing explained by comparative analyses, nor by com-

parison of their physical qualities. In parallel conditions in the laboratory, they did

not observe the same order of waste as at sea; hence external causes must have

had a principal share in the difference, namely, friction, as well as chemical action,

--in sea-going ships; sulphureous exhalations upon those which lie on the black
--mud ; increased temperature, and heavy electrical discharges, in tropical climates,

both exciting chemical action ;-- corrosive contents of some sea-waters. The nails

used for fastening it have also considerable electro-chemical influence.

But allowing for all these causes, there are cases where the fault appears to be in

the copper itself. The electro-chemical influence of the nails may be easily rendered

protective                                       and coal-tar seems to afford an effective  mechanical protection.  Labo-
                                              ;

ratory experiments must however, in such cases, be taken chiefly as indications for

others on the working scale, which require opportunity as well as time. By sending

ships to sea, each having her two sides sheathed with different coppers, but fastened
with the same nails, the shipwright would soon learn whose copper he can best
confide in, and the chemist would be supplied with materials for satisfactory com-

parative analyses.
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  4/

    Mr. Prideaux exhibited a specimen of a compound of oxide of lead with empy-
reumatic oil, produced in the distillation of wood, and forwarded by Mr. A. Tunstall
of Neath. This compound, which had some resemblance to diachylon, was en-
tirely soluble in boiling water, from which sulphuric acid separated the lead, and
the oil floated on the surface.

On the influence of the Ferrocyanate of Potash on the Iodide of Silver, pro-

   ducing a highly sensitive Photographic Preparation. By Mr. R. Hunt.

   The author having been engaged in experiments on those varieties of photographic
drawings which are formed by the action of the hydriodic salts on the darkened chloride
of silver, and, with a view to the removal of the iodide formed by the process, from the
paper, was led to observe some peculiar changes produced by the combined influences
of light and the ferrocyanate of potash. It was found that the ordinary photographic
paper, if allowed to darken in sunshine, and then slightly acted on by any hydriodic
salt, and, when dry, washed with a solution of the ferrocyanate of potash, became
extremely sensitive to light, changing from a light brown to a full black by a mo-
ment's exposure to sunshine. Following out this result, it was discovered that
perfectly pure iodide of silver was acted on with even greater rapidity ; and thus it
became easy to form an exquisitely sensitive photographic paper.

  --The method recommended is the following : highly-glazed letter-paper is washed

over with a solution of one drachm of nitrate of silver to an ounce of distilled water
it is quickly dried, and a second time washed with the same solution. It is then,
when dry, placed for a minute in a solution of two drachms of the hydriodate
of potash in six ounces of water, placed on a smooth board, gently washed by

allowing some water to flow over it, and dried in the dark at common tempera-
tures. Paper thus prepared may be kept for any length of time, and is at any
moment rendered far more sensivive than any known photographic preparation, ex-

cepting the calotype, which it quite equals, by simply washing it over with a solu-
tion formed of one drachm of the ferrocyanate of potash to an ounce of water.

   These papers may be washed with the ferrocyanate, and dried in the dark ; in
this dry state they are absolutely insensible, but they may at any moment be ren-

dered sensitive by merely washing them with a little cold water.
    Paper thus prepared is rendered quite insensible by being washed over with the

above hydriodic solution, and from the photograph thus fixed many copies may be

 taken.

   The author then described the action of the spectrum on this preparation, and
pointed out, that the greatest effect was produced by the least refrangible rays, but
that all the rays, excepting the extreme red, acted with considerable energy. The
impressed spectrum was in all cases distinctly coloured from end to end ; and it
was found that the colours of superposed media left a corresponding tint upon the
paper, but unfortunately as the paper dried the colours faded. These results bring

nearer the probability of being enabled to produce eventually photographic pictures

in their native colours.

   The spectra formed on these papers were all surrounded by a marked space, which
was protected from the influence of the dispersed light, exhibiting another proof of
the fact noticed before, by Sir John Herschel and the author, that a class of rays,
having peculiar negative properties, emanated from the edges of the sun. Some
spectra and numerous specimens of these drawings were exhibited.

On Manures considered as Stimulatits to Vegetation. By Professor Daubent.

   In this paper the author discussed the question as to the sense in which manures

may be considered to act as stimulants to plants.

    It is evident, that if the term stimulus be understood in an acceptation similar to
that in which it is employed with reference to the animal economy, it ought to be
confined to bodies which by their presence assist in promoting the secretion and as-
similation of the nutritious substances present, and ought not to include such as them-
selves afford materials for secretion. Thus salt and other condiments do not them-
selves nourish the animal, but by their presence induce its secreting surfaces to
assimilate more readily the juices brought into contact with them.

  Now it becomes a fit subject for inquiry, whether manures operate in the for-

mer manner or in the latter, and likewise whether the fact, that certain of them
--48 REPORT 1841.

act less beneficially at subsequent periods of their application than they did at the

first, admits of being explained on the recognised principle, " that stimuli lose their
full effect upon living matter when frequently repeated."

   Dr. Daubeny adduced several facts, which led to the inference, that nitrates of
soda and of potass operate favourably upon certain crops by communicating to them
nitrogen, and that the reason why these salts sometimes have appeared to leave the
land in a worse condition than it was in before their use, is not that they are stimuli,
and therefore amenable to the law above quoted, but is because the free supply of
nitrogen afforded by tli^ir decomposition had caused the plant to absorb a larger

portion of those other ingredients, such as phosphate of lime, silicate of potass,
&c., which are present only in a limited quantity in the soil, thus tending to exhaust
the latter of these materials, and causing thereby an inferior crop to be produced in

the following year.

  Now though it may be true that the nitrates in this manner indirectly stimulate

the vital energies of a'plant, yet it was conceived that the term stimulus had better
be abandoned with reference to such cases, as its adoption might lead to an erroneous
impression in the mind of the farmer, with respect to the proper mode of restoring to

the land its original fertility.

   If the theory suggested by the author be the true one, it will follow, that the pro-
per remedy would be, not to discontinue the use of the nitrates, but by the applica-
tion of bone-manure, &c., at intermediate periods, to restore to the land those other
ingredients which had been abstracted from it in too large a quantity.

   To determine what materials are wanting, and in what proportions they ought to
be applied (independently of the empirical plan of ascertaining by repeated trials
the substances which by their addition succeed best in remedying the deficiency),
two methods present themselves. The first, a difficult one, is to learn, by a minute
analysis of the soil, whether the ingredients which the crop requires are actually
present, and to add of these a quantity equal to that which the intended crop is cal-
culated to contain. The second, a more practical scheme, is to estimate, in the first
place, how much of these substances exists in the crop taken off the ground, and
then to add to it at least an equivalent quantity in the shape of manure.

   The Professor suggested, that a kind of book-keeping should be undertaken in
farming establishments on this principle, a debtor and creditor account being made

out, of the quantity of nitrogen, of earthy phosphates, of alkali, &c., abstracted in

the foi-m of crop, and restored in that of manure each year.

   He then concluded the paper by specifying certain points relative to this subject,

which seem to require further investigation
   1st. To confirm or disprove his theory with respect to the operation of the nitrates,

by determining whether they actually diminish in quantity, and finally disappear,
after several successive crops have been grown upon land impregnated with these

salts.

   2ndly. Whether the same explanation applies to the agency of common salt and

other mineral manures as to that of the nitrates, or whether any of them act directly

On the Disintegration of the Dolomitic Rocks ofthe Tyrol. Bi/ Prof.DAVBEJ^v.

   The author attempted to explain, without resorting to volcanic agency, the abrupt
form, extraordinary height, naked outline, and fissured surface of the dolomitic
rocks in the Tyrol. He attributed the above circumstances to the slow rate at which
decomposition proceeds in rocks consisting of pure dolomite, and to the strength of
cohesion which binds together the particles of this rock, owing to which, even those
portions which stand prominent, in consequence of the removal, by the agents of de-
struction, of their contiguous parts, often remain unaffected by the mechanical forces
which would cause the projecting portions of a rock less unyielding in its texture
to become detached. The cause therefore of the greater height which is maintained
by the dolomites of the Tyrol than by the pyroxenic rocks which accompa.ny them,
seems to be the inferior rate at which decomposition has proceeded in the former,
whilst the bold and jagged outline they display may have been produced by the
                                                                               TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                   49

tenacity with which their parts cohere. The sterile character of these same rocks,
even in parts which are not precipitous, appears to be owing to the slowness with
which they decompose, as well as perhaps to the absence of organic remains. The
Professor concluded with some suggestions as to the means of fertilizing rocks con-
taining magnesia, in cases where, from the slowness of their decomposition, they con-
tinue sterile ; and proposed in such cases to accelerate their disintegration, by pouring
upon the subsoil diluted sulphuric acid.

Practical Method of determining the Quantity of Real Indigo in the Indigos

 of Commerce. By Dr. Samuel L. Da^a, of Lowell, 3Iassachusetts, U.S.

Dr. Dana is chemist in the most extensive calico-printing works of the United

States. Not less than 50,000 lbs. of indigo are consumed annually in that establish-

ment. Hence the importance of guiding the purchasers of that article by the results

of easily performed analyses of samples. The following is the method employed by

Dr. Dana, and which he requested might be laid before the Chemical Section of the

British Association :

1. Reduce the indigo to an impalpable powder.

   2. Boil, in a long-neck flask (a Florence flask will do), ten grains of indigo, a few
minutes, in 2| oz. of a solution of carbonate of soda, marking 30° to 35° on Twaddel's

hydrometer                                                        then         add  eight  grains, in crystals,  of  muriate  of tin,  and boil for half an
                                                               ;

Ahour.  beautiful yellow solution of indigo will be obtained. Withdraw from the

lamp, and,

   3. Introduce into the solution (2.) 500 water-grain measures of a solution of fifty
grains bichromate of potash in 4000 grains of water. The indigo blue, with a trace

of indigo red, will be precipitated, while the other components remain in solution.

   4. Filter the precipitate (3.) through a double weighed filter, washing the mass with
one ounce of muriatic acid diluted with three ounces of boiling water ; wash with

hot water till only water returns.

5. Separate, dry and weigh the filters ; note the weight of the precipitate; burn one

filter against the other ; weigh ; the difference is the silica contained in the indigo,
which, deducted from the weight of the precipitate, gives the quantity of pure indigo.

Dr. Dana states that he has verified the accuracy of this mode by repeated results

obtained in the dye-house ; the indigo spending exactly in proportion to the quantity

of that substance as found by analysis. He has also been able to use much more

productive indigos since the agent of his house in Calcutta has been instructed by the

results of these experiments.

  --Mr. Walter Crum, who communicated the above, adds the remark : Carbonate of

soda with protoxide of tin does dissolve indigo and forms a yellow solution, but so

slowly, that I doubt if all the ten grains are acted upon. I think Dr. Dana must

mean soda-ash, which contains a notable quantity of caustic soda ; but a much weaker

solution of caustic soda would answer the purpose.

Some Experiments shoioing the possibility of Fire, from the use of Hot Water

  in warming Buildings, and of explosions in Steam-engine Boilers. By

   GOLDSWORTHY GuRNEY.

After detailing several instances of fire which arose from the steam pipes of water

apparatus used for warming houses, the author proceeds to describe some of the ex-

periments likely to be of practical value. From a tubular boiler, driving a high-pres-
sure engine, the injection pump was cut off; half an hour after the supply pump was

stopped, no water appeared on opening the gauge cocks, and the engine was observed

to slacken its rate and to move sluggishly ; it had dropped from 50 to 30 strokes a
minute. The steam pipe from the boiler to the engine was 40 feet long, and was

carried for convenience through the open air, thickly wrapped round with woollen

cloth to prevent radiation : soon after the engine became sluggish, the woollen cloth
was observed to char near the boiler, an effect which soon extended along the whole

length of pipe                                                                 the engine still working,  but with more apparent difficult}-,  making
                                                                            ;

only 16 strokes per minute ; the pressure gauge, which usually ranged between 30 and

40 pounds, now stood at 15, and was gradually sinking. In about five minutes after

the woollen cloth had charred, a lead flange, used as a packing at the cylinder joint,

melted, and was followed by a loud escape of elastic matter. Tlie engine stopped

working, and on bringing a lighted match into the escapage, it took fire, and burnt

with the lambent flame of hydrogen gas. The author's impression was, that the

escaping vapour was not pure hydrogen. Water condensed on a piece of cold iron

held in the flame, but no water condensed on the cold iron after the flame was ex-

tinguished. On examining the boiler, all the tubes were found fed-hot. This

experiment was repeated with many modifications. The temperature of the escaping

vapour was ascertained by means of bars, previously prepared to melt at different

--temperatures
                                                                       ;
these indicated a temperature of about 400°.                              In about eight minutes

a piece of pure lead melted woollen cloth was charred, and a piece of tow held in

the escapage took fire. In other experiments it was found that the pipes became

sufficiently hot to explode gunpowder and many chemical preparations.

Having satisfied himself of this property of heated steam or elastic matter, formed

from the last portions of water in a boiler, the author proceeded to examine, as far as

--possible, its chemical nature to determine whether any decomposition, or new ele-

mentary formation, took place. He found that the elastic matter was not conden-

sable over cold water, and would not in many cases burn, or show any indications of

the presence of hydrogen, or other inflammable matters. In some experiments

it was found to extinguish flame. The experiments with copper vessels afforded the

same results as those manufactured from iron. From these experiments it appeared,

that whenever the heating apparatus falls short of water, the elastic matter formed

over the fire will carry sufficient heat through close pipes, to any distance, to set fire

to wood and other combustible bodies, and that whether the hot-water apparatus be

under pressure or not, or whether the heating surface be of tubes, plates, or cylin-

ders. On the other hand, it would further appear, from some experiments enume-

rated, that in no case is there danger when a given quantity of water is present.

Mr. Gurney suggests, that if both ends of the circulating series in hot- water appa-

ratus, namely, the part which immediately goes from the heating surface beyond the

furnace, and that part where the circulation returns to it before it enters the furnace,

were made of a metal which would not melt at the fair working temperature of the

water, but which would melt at a temperature of from 500 to 600° of heat (say lead

pipe), there would be little, if any, danger from fire.

             On Spontaneous Combustion. By A. Booth, F.L.S.

   The author stated that he had nothing novel to offer either in the way of theory or
facts, but simply to draw attention to a long series of circumstances in well recorded

and authenticated instances. These were scattered throughout the various scientific
and public records, and had never been collected into any form. From his inquiries he

was satisfied that many fires originated from the phsenomenon of spontaneous com-

bustion, and he considered it highly proper that persons should be put upon their

guard with respect to the operations of an insidious danger. He commenced by noti-
cing pigeons' dung, which was known at a very remote date, as Galen observed that
pigeons' dung takes fire when it becomes rotten, and that the dung of a pigeon was

sufficient to set fire to a whole house. This is further confirmed by Father Casati, a

Jesuit, who relates to have been informed, that from the great quantities of the dung of
doves, large flights of which used for many ages to build under the roof of the great

church of Pisa, sprung originally the fire which consumed the said church. Cases
had been also recorded of dung-hills and stable litter, turf and peat, corn, wheat-flour,

oatmeal, torrefied vegetable substances, as saw-dust, roasted coffee and chocolate nuts,
beans, peas and lentiles, and charred or heated vegetable substances, malt and torre-

fied bran, the latter of which was much used in different parts of Germany as an
external application for diseased cattle. He also adduced instances of madder, saf-

fron, ha}', charcoal, charcoal and coal ashes, lamp-black, coal, nitric acid packed in
saw-dust, tan, vegetables boiled in oil or fat, wool, wool combings, woollen cloth,
woollen stuffs, cotton, cotton goods, cotton prepared for dyeing, waste cotton in

manufactories, candlewick yarn in imitation of cotton yarn, hemp and flax, oakum
and linseed oil, hempen fibres and oil, drying oils, cere cloth or oiled canvass, sail-

cloth, rags, paper, paint, cloth used in wiping paint-brushes, &c. Mr. Booth said
that his attention was strongly impressed upon these circumstances some years back,

on account of the execution of a young man named James Butler, on suspicion of
                                                                                                 TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.             51

setting fire to a floor-cloth manufactory. He felt convinced that this unfortunate
young man was an innocent victim of the law, and that spontaneous combustion
was the cause. An instance recently occurred in London, in which two persons

were apprehended and remanded at a police office on suspicion of setting fire to a ma-
nufactoiy of patent felt, which was afterwards found to be produced by spontaneous
combustion. He considered the subject as of high importance in a social point of
view, and particularly where large constructions were concerned, as in the case of

the late fire on board the Talavera.

On some instances of Restrained Chemical Action. By E. A. Parnell.

The object of this paper is to add to the list of circumstances which modify or

prevent the action of chemical affinity, the presence of water in the sphere of de-

composition producing a force of considerable power, and one whose action has not

been hitherto recognised. Its existence has been traced by observing the want of
action of certain gases, and especially sulphuretted hydrogen, when in a perfectly

dry state, on substances on which they exert a vigorous action in the presence of

water. Thus papers impregnated with salts of lead, mercury and copper, were

preserved from the action of sulphuretted hydrogen if rendered absolutely dry.

That the effect of water in permitting action between these same bodies, does not

wholly depend on diminution of the force of cohesion, by dissolving either the gas

or the salt, is proved by several circumstances. 1st, This want of action is perceived

only on particular salts ; 2nd, to restore the action, water may be present in a state

of combination with the salt, and can then exert no solvent power ; 3rd, on moisten-

ing different dry salts with absolute alcohol, which dissolves six times its volume of

sulphuretted hydrogen, and exposing to the gas, still no action ensued.

   On considering the nature of the salts on which the action of sulphuretted hydro-

gen is restrained, it appears that the function of water, in permitting action, is to

combine with tlie acid, which should be rendered free by sulphuretted hydrogen im-

mediately on its liberation. One equivalent of water is not in every case sufficient

to satisfy the acid                                                                              for all anhydrous salts of the oxides of  mercury, copper or lead,
                                                                                              ;

can produce one equivalent of water with sulphuretted hydrogen.

The action of water may in some measure be assimilated to that between sulphuric

acid of different degrees of strength, and metallic iron or zinc. These metals, as is well

known, undergo no change in oil of vitriol ; while in this case, as well as when dry

sulphate of lead is exposed to dry sulphuretted hydrogen, it would be said all is pre-

sent that is necessary to produce decomposition. But in both cases water must be

added for action to ensue ; in the one, to unite with sulphate of zinc about to be

formed, and in the other with the sulphuric acid. But there are some salts of those

metals which are unacted on by sulphuretted hydrogen when dry, whose acid, or

hydracid of its salt-radical, possesses but little affinity for water, and consequently

to which this explanation will not apply. In considering the cause of the want of

action here, it must be remembered that sulphur is in reality a weak radical ; that,

if the salt be soluble, a force is called into action, when its solution is acted on by

sulphuretted hydrogen, which possesses great power over the results of chemical ac-

tion, namely, insolubility of the sulphuret ; and water being present, with which the

acid can unite when free, it does not follow that decomposition must occur iu one case,

because it will in another under the influence of other forces. The author concludes

by suggesting an explanation of the singular action between potash and carbonate of

--lime, in presence of a small quantity of water, observed by Prof. Liebig carbonate

of potash and caustic lime being formed. Both caustic potash and carbonate of

potash have a strong affinity for water, but of the two, caustic potash the greater.

Here is sufficient water to supply the demands of the carbonate, but not of caustic

potash ; the result is, carbonate of potash and caustic lime are formed.

 On some subjects connected with the Sulphocyanides. By E. A. Parnell.

   The author referred to a paper published in the Phil. Mag. for October 1840, in
which it was shown that the substance supposed to be the isolated radical of the
sulphocyanides (obtained by the action of chlorine or nitric acid on sulphocyanide
of potassium) contained hydrogen as an essential constituent, and could not there-

                                          e2
--52 REPORT 1841.

fore be regarded as that radical. The present communication consists, first, in an

investigation of the evidence on which this body acquired its character as the radical

secondly, an examination of other reputed sources of this substance ; thirdly, of the

action of iodine on sulphocyanide of potassium ; and lastly, some theoretical con-
siderations on the constitution of the sulphocyanides. Three arguments may be ad-

vanced in favour of the radical character of the body procured from the sulphocyan-

ides by chlorine ; first, its analysis ; second, the mode of its formation ; and third,

so far as the existence of hydrogen is concerned, the circumstance of its formation

from dry sulphocyanide of potassium, an anhydrous salt, by dry chlorine.

The evidence afforded by its analysis was, that M. Liebig obtained the same amount

of sulphur as should be contained in the pure radical, and that it contained carbon

and nitrogen in the same proportion as cyanogen. But this is the case with other

substances which may be derived from the sulphocyanides : hydrothiocyanic acid,

metasulphocyanogen, and the true radical, contain very nearly the same amount of

sulphur, and also carbon and nitrogen in the same proportion as cyanogen. And as,

on the other hand, it has been found constantly to contain hydrogen, its anal^'sis

has not been sufficient to justify its being considered the radical. With regard to

the mode of its formation, were this radical either a simple or a stable substance, the

process might have been expected to produce it ; but its liability to decomposition in

the nascent state is so great, that this argument is of little weight. Sulphuric acid,

cyanogen, and an ammoniacal salt exist among the products. As to the circum-

stance of its formation out of contact with hydrogen or oxygen, that is, by fused

sulphocyanide of potassium and dry chlorine, the author has' been assured that sul-

phocyanide of potassium, usually considered to be an anhydrous salt, retains, after

solution, recrystallization and fusion, a certain amount of water in combination ; so
that should the product of the action of dry chlorine on fused sulphocyanide of po-

tassium contain hydrogen, as does the product of action of chlorine on solution of

sulphocyanide of potassium, the source of the hydrogen is quite obvious.
   The yellow product of spontaneous decomposition of hydrosulphocyanic acid, and

the yellow precipitate produced in solutions of the sulphocyanides by voltaic agency,

are considered by some to be identical with the product of action of chlorine. On

examination each was found to consist of hydrothiocyanic acid ; that is, the acid

produced from metasulphocyanogen by the action of alkalies. The action of iodine

on solutions of the sulphocyanides is precisely analogous to that of chlorine. There

Aare produced cyanogen, sulphuric acid, ammonia, and metasulphocyanogen.  re-

markable circumstance connected with hydrothiocyanic acid and metasulphocyanogen

(products of decomposition of sulphocyanogen) is, that each contains twelve equiva-

lents of sulphur, which is the number representing, according to Prof. Graham, the

salimolecular group of that element, as founded on its isomorphism in one state with

bisulphate of potash. Sulphocyanide of potassium retains, after once dissolved, pre-
cisely one-sixth of an equivalent of water, so that the equivalent of this salt, and
probably of sulphocyanogen itself, must be multiplied by six ; one equivalent will
then include twelve atoms of sulphur. Hydrosulphocyanic acid thus falling to be

represented as Sj, Cy^ -|- Hg, a rational formula is at once suggested for metasul-

phocyanogen, that of a hydrated hydrosulphocyanic acid, in which four out of the

+ Hsix equivalents of hydrogen have been removed, or 8,3 Cy^, H,  O.

Should these views of the constitution of sulphocyanogen prove correct, it must

be viewed as a hexabasic radical, in whose salts each atom of the base must always

be of the same name.

On the direct Formation of Cyanogenfrom its Elements. By G. Fownes.

After referring to the experiments of Desfosses, which went to show that gaseous

nitrogen, brought into contact with charcoal at a high temperature, an alkali being

present, is absorbed in notable quantity, andacorrespondingamount of cyanide pro-

duced                          and also to the process for manufacturing Prussian blue, by Lewis Thomson,
                            ;

in which nitrogen is derived from the atmosphere, the author proceeded to show that

the existence of nitrogen, in a solid state, in many varieties of charcoal, and the

possible presence of ammonia in the nitrogen gas employed, were sources of error

against which it was necessary to guard.

The author uniformly found, that whenever wood-charcoal or coke are ignited in a

close crucible with carbonate of potash at a moderate red heat, cyanide in abundance

is always produced, which is never the case with pure charcoal, provided the tempe-
rature does not exceed redness. After some preliminary trials, the results of which

were unequivocal, a mixture of fifty grains of pure sugar-charcoal, and fifty grains of

carbonate of potash, obtained by gently igniting pure bicarbonate, was placed in a

porcelain tube fixed across a furnace, and maintained at a full red heat, while pure

nitrogen gas, very carefully prepared by acting on solution of ammonia by chlorine,

was slowly passed over the mixture. At the further extremity of the porcelain tube,

a small gas-delivering tube was arranged, dipping into a vessel of water. At the

commencement, the quantity of gas emitted by the exit end of the arrangement

greatly exceeded that passed into the tube : it had no odour, did not render lime-

water turbid, and burned with a bright blue flame, generating carbonic acid. After

some time the carbonic oxide diminished in quantity, until at length nitrogen alone

escaped. The tube, when cold, being examined, was found to contain a black

Aporous mass, which hissed and became very hot on the addition of water.            little

of the  filtered  solution  gave,  by  " Schee'le's test," abundance  of  Prussian  blue
                                                                                                       ;

another small portion, acidulated with nitric acid, gave a copious white precipitate

with nitrate of silver ; and the residue, distilled with dilute sulphuric acid (the addi-

tion of which scarcely occasioned efi'ervescence), afforded about half an ounce of tole-

rably strong hydrocyanic acid. Arrangements were made for repeating the experi-

ment, employing the nitrogen of the atmosphere in place of that artificially prepared,

the result of which was, as before, a black mass rich in cyanide of potassium.

The amount of carbonate of potash converted into cyanide by direct absorption of

nitrogen, appears to depend very much on the temperature employed. In two trials,

at a full red heat, the quantity of carbonate converted amounted to 11 '5 and 12'5

per cent, of that employed. When, however, the temperature was raised to white-

ness, much above the melting point of copper, the production of cyanide appeared

much greater.
  When carbonate of soda was substituted for the potash-salt, cyanide was gene-

rated, but it seemed with much greater difficulty. The fact therefore appears to Mr.

Fownes to be established, that free nitrogen can at a high temperature combine di-

rectly with carbon, provided some metal or similar body be present, whose cyanide is

permanent under such circumstances.

        Abstract of a Letter from Prof. Liebig to Dr. Playfair.

mySome interesting results have been lately obtained in  laboratory.      M. Schunk

has obtained a white crystalline substance, in large quantity, from the lichens which

are employed to prepare archil {Lecanora tartarea, &c.), by extraction with sether.
It differs from erythrine and the compounds described by Dr. Kane, in its insolubility
in water. With alkalies it behaves in a remarkable manner. It dissolves readily in
alkaline solutions, and is capable of being again precipitated by acids, if the solution
be recently made ; but if kept standing for some hours, acids produce no precipitate :
it has then been decomposed, and is converted to carbonic acid and orceine. If the
substance be dissolved in baryta-water, and the clear solution boiled, a large preci-
pitate of carbonate of barytes occurs, and the filtered solution gives, on evaporation,
large crystals of orceine. From this circumstance a number of phenomena on the
colour of lichens can be explained, which Dr. Kane has described in his work on that

subject.

   I have performed many experiments on the legumin in beans, and some other legu-

minous plants, and have arrived at the remarkable conclusion, that this body is iden-

tical with the casein in milk of animals. It has precisely the same composition, and

-- --contains the same salts phosphate of potash, potash, magnesia, lime and iron as

the casein of milk.

   Dr. Will and Dr. Varrentrapp have devised an excellent method for determining the
amount of nitrogen in organic bodies : it is very exact and easily performed. The
substance is mixed with a quantity of caustic potash and hydrate of soda, and heated
in an ordinary combustion tube to redness. All the nitrogen in the substance escapes
as pure ammonia, which is condensed in a small and neat apparatus containing dilute

hydrochloric acid. This solution is mixed with chloride of platinum, evaporated to
dryness in a water-bath, and the excess of chloride of platinum is washed from the
--54 REPORT 1841.

ammonio-chloride by a mixture of aether and alcohol. From the metallic platinum
which remains after the ammonio-chloride is heated to redness, the quantity of nitro-

gen is to be calculated.

   We have repeated all the experiments of Dr. Brown on the production of silicon

from paracyanogen, but we have not been able to confirm one of his results. What

 pur experiments prove is, that paracyanogen is decomposed by a strong heat into ni-
trogen gas, and a residue of charcoal, which is exceedingly difficult of combustion.

   Neiv extemporaneous Process for the Production of Hydrocyanic Acidfor

                Medical Use. By Robert D. Thomson, M.D.

    The importance of prussic acid as a remedial agent in spasmodic diseases, such as
hysteria, chorea, &c., has induced the author to bestow much attention upon the pro-

duction of this acid, so as to obtain it always of uniform strength. He has accord-

ingly subjected to trial all the processes which have been recommended in this coun-
try for the formation of prussic acid, and not finding them in all respects satisfactory,
 proposes the following process as less liable to objection than any of the preceding.
The first step consists in forming a pure cyanide of lead. This object may be effected
in various ways, either by precipitating acetate of lead by hydrocyanic acid as pre-
pared from the ferrocyanide of potassium and sulphuric acid, according to the pro-
cess of the Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia, in a stoppered bottle, or by distilling from the
mixed materials into a Wolff's bottle, containing a solution of acetate of lead. In
either case a definite compound of cyanogen and lead will be obtained, which is to be
carefully washed and gently heated. Care should be taken that the water in which
the acetate of lead is dissolved is perfectly pure. Distilled water will frequently pre-

cipitate acetate of lead, owing to the greater or less quantity of carbonate of ammo-
nia contained in rain-water. It may be removed, as has been pointed out by Prof.

Liebig, by adding to the water, previous to distillation, a few drops of sulphuric acid,
or a few grains of alum.

    The cyanide of lead having been properly washed and dried, the next step in the
process consists in decomposing it by means of sulphuric acid. In order to obtain
an acid of the strength of the acidum hydrocyanicum dilutum of the London Pharma-
copoeia, or containing about two per cent, of absolute acid, the following formula will
be found convenient :

   Take 46'36 grains of cyanide of lead,
                   2 fluid drachms of dilute sulphuric acid (London Pharmacopoeia),
                   6 fluid drachms of pure distilled water.

Introduce the cyanide of lead into a stoppered bottle ; mix the acid and water in a
glass vessel ; allow the mixture to cool, and then pour it upon the cyanide of lead
close the stopper and agitate the fluid and salt together. After standing for some
time, pour off the supernatant liquor from the precipitated sulphate of lead, and pre-

^erve it in a stoppered bottle.

   This formula is founded upon the circumstance, that dilute sulphuric acid of the
London Pharmacopoeia contains, in each fluid drachm, about 9-5 grains of oil of vitriol

H(S O3 O). Two drachms will therefore contain 19 grains of oil of vitriol. The quan-

tity required for saturating 46-36 grains of cyanide of lead is only 17'4 grains; but
the small excess is useful in preserving the acid.

   The advantage of this process, it will be observed, consists in the employment of
liquid measures in apportioning the fluids, and in using an acid for the liberation of
the cyanogen, which, although added in excess, possess a preservative instead of a
deteriorating influence. The author is quite persuaded, from his experience of the use
of hydrocyanic acid in medicine, that in spasmodic diseases it is one of the most va-

luable agents we possess ; but he is of opinion that the prescriber should watch its

action, and repeat the dose until the desired effect is attained.

      On the Composition of Crystallized Diabetic Sugar. By Robert

                                    D. Thomson, M.D.

   Having observed various statements in books respecting the crystallization of dia-

betic sugar, the author was anxious to test their accuracy by experiment. On the
first favourable opportunity the test was applied. An Italian, who had been labour-

ing under diabetes for some weeks, was the patient from whom the urine was ob-

tained. Its specific gravity was 1035 ; 300 grains of the fluid yielded 25'9 grains of
sugar. The urine, when evaporated, afforded a honey-like residue ; but upon care-

fully evaporating a portion, and pouring off gradually the fluid part, rhomboidal

colourless crystals were procured. These possessed a saline taste, and upon being

analysed, yielded

Volatile matter                                  8-04 ... 80*4
                                                 1-96 ... 19-6

They were, therefore, obviously the well-known compound of sugar and common

salt. According to Peligot, this compound contains from six to seven per cent, of

water ; the above analysis would therefore give

                   Sugar                         73-4

                   Common salt                   19"6

The crystals were not quite pure, which accounts for the deficiency of common salt

compared with the results usually given.
   The author has since been enabled to obtain very regular crystals, and to procure

any quantity of saccharine crystals from diabetic urine, by adding a small portion of

common salt during the evaporation of the urine. He found that very regular cry-

stals obtained in the Glasgow laboratory, and which were supposed to be pure sugar,

contained common salt ; the urine from which it was procured possessing an extra
quantity of common salt. He has also been informed by Mr. M'Gregor of Glasgow,
that the crystals of saccharine matter obtained by him in his experiments, were found,
on being tested, to contain common salt. The facility or difficulty of obtaining cry-
stallized diabetic sugar would appear to depend on the quantity of common salt ex-

isting in the fluid from which the crystallization is made.
   These observations would therefore seem to call in question the accuracy of the

conclusion, that diabetic sugar is capable of crystallizing in a regular form, or of as-
suming a superior crystalline structure to that of grape sugar.

         On the Radical of the Kakodyle Series. By Prof. Bunsen.

   The method recommended as the easiest of procuring kakodyle in a pure state is the

--following: Chloride of kakodyle, carefully freed from the oxide by treatment with

strong muriatic acid, is allowed to stand some time over chloride of calcium and
quick-Ume to remove the water and all excess of acid. It is then introduced into a
distillatory apparatus, carefully filled with carbonic acid, and containing some slips
of clean sheet-zinc. Any of the metals which decompose water will answer, but
zinc is best. It is probable that hydrogen or carbon would produce a similar de-
composition with suitable modifications of the apparatus. The vessel is then her-
metically sealed, and the mixture of zinc with the chloride is exposed in a water-bath

to a temperature of 212° Fahr. for some hours. When the decomposition is com-

plete, a white saline mass is formed, which melts into an oily liquid between 240°
and 248° Fahr. While the apparatus is still hot, the point of the tube leading into
the condenser is dipped below the surface of boiled distilled water ; as the appa-
ratus cools the water rises into it. The tube is hermetically sealed ; the water dis-
solves chloride of zinc, leaving the excess of zinc and the kakodyle, which falls as an
oily liquid to the bottom. This is rectified twice or three times in vessels filled with
carbonic acid as before, the water being afterwards removed by chloride of calcium
in the usual way. Thus obtained it is a colourless liquid, transparent, and of a high

refractive power, in appearance and odour much resembling the oxide of kakodyle

it ignites instantly on being brought in contact with air, giving oft' water and car-
bonic and arsenious acids. If air be gradually admitted, thick white clouds are
evolved, and oxide of kakodyle and kakodylic acid are formed. If the supply of
oxygen be insufficient for complete combustion, erythrarsin is deposited, mixed with
a black fuetid layer of arsenic. In chlorine kakodyle burns with a brighter flame,
depositing charcoal. Digested with zinc and muriatic acid, erythrarsin and a variety

of other products are generated. Similar results are obtained with protochloride of
tin, phosphorous acid, and other powerful reducing agents. It boils at about 338°
Fahr., and freezes at about 21° Fahr., forming large square prisms, gradually chan-
ging into a mass resembling ice in appearance. The density of its vapour by calcula-

tion is 7'2S1 ; experimentally it was found to be 7" 101. By combustion with oxide

--of copper, two experiments yielded the following results :

Carbon               1.      2.

                 2230    22-23

Loss and oxygen  '93 1-44

                 100-00  100-00

which numbers closely agree with the following theoretical numbers :

4 Carbon                 23-15

6 Hydrogen               5-67

2 Arsenic                71-18

                                                                                                 100-00

This approximation is as great as can be expected, where the exclusion of oxygen is
so essential, and so difficult to be effected.

   Kakodyle thus insulated can be combined directly to form all the various substances

of which this series consists. By direct exposure to oxygen the oxide and acid are

formed. Sulphur dissolves in kakodyle, forming a solution whic?i possesses all the
properties of the sulphuret; and the higher degiee of sulphuration is obtained with
equal facility by the addition of a larger portion of sulphur. This is a solid, soluble

in aether, from which solution it may be obtained in beautiful crystals. An aqueous

solution of chlorine added to the radical occasions the immediate production of the

chloride of kakodyle, and most of the other compounds may be procured with nearly

equal facility. If kakodyle be distilled with chloride of zinc, various products of

different degrees of volatility are obtained, containing various proportions of arsenic
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

the most volatile being the least disposed to spontaneous inflammation in the air,

and containing the smallest amount of arsenic. By heating the vapour of any of

these products in a jar over quicksilver to a temperature not greatly exceeding the

boiling point of that metal, it undergoes decomposition, metallic arsenic is deposited,
and carburetted hydrogen is formed, without the smallest deposit of carbon. The
gaseous mixture burns with a clear bright flame, depositing a minute film of arsenic,
caused by traces of a volatile arsenical compound, which gives the gas the property

of inflaming when passed up by bubbles into a jar containing chlorine. Mixed with
oxygen and detonated, 1-5 vol. of gas requires 3-5 of oxygen for combustion, and
2-0 vols, of carbonic acid are formed. This shows it to contain 4 vols, of carbon
vapour and 12 vols, of hydrogen, condensed into 6 vols. Fuming sulphuric acid
absorbs one-third of the carburetted hydrogen, and the remaining gas, when deto-
nated with oxygen, gives the same results as marsh gas. It is unaffected by chlorine

in the dark, but in sunshine forms camphor-like crystals, exactly like those produced

in similar circumstances from the marsh gas. Among the products of the decompo-

sition of kakodyle is a remarkable substance termed by Bunsen Erythrarsin. At
present it can only be obtained as a secondary product, and the following method
yields it the purest :-- About 100 grammes of oxide of kakodyle are treated with
strong muriatic acid ; chlorine of kakodyle is the principal product, but at the same
time a flocculent brick-red precipitate occurs, which remains behind aftei the chlo-

ride has been distilled : during the boiling it collects into darker coloured masses.
It is treated several times with absolute alcohol to remove the last traces of chlorine.
Air must be carefully excluded during the whole process, and it must ultimately be
dried in vacuo, as slow oxidation would otherwise occur, arsenious acid being formed.

The 100 grammes of oxide of kakodyle affords only 0-5 gramme of erythrarsin. Thus
obtained, erythrarsin forms an amorphous almost inodorous mass, of a colour between

dark red and steel-blue, and is easily reduced to a brick-red powder. It is insoluble
in alcohol, aether, water, and solution of potash. Fuming nitric acid decomposes it
with production of light. In weaker acid it also dissolves with decomposition.

Heated alone in a tube, fumes smelling of oxide of kakodyle are evolved, and a sub-

limate of arsenious acid and metallic arsenic is produced. The results of the only

   From the discovery of kakodyle the theory of compound radicals has received a

confirmation scarcely to be gainsaid; for not only has the radical itself been insu-
lated, but the whole kakodyle series has been formed from it directly. Further, the
specific gravity of the vapour of the substance obtained is exactly what it should be
for the radical, supposing the laws of condensation, which hold for inorganic com-

pounds, to be applicable also to organic bodies. From the decompositions effected
by heat on this radical, it seems not improbable that kakodyle is an arseniuretted
compound of a binary radical, consisting of C^ Hj. Erythrarsin may be conjectured
to be an oxide of a ternary radical, containing three times as much arsenic as kako-

dyle ; but this idea does not at present rest on any strong evidence.

On the Production of Sulphuretted Hydrogen by the Action of Vegetable

  Matter on Solutions containing Sulphates. By E. Lankester, M.D.

   Dr. Lankester stated that observation had enabled him to detect sulphuretted hy-
drogen in water, by the presence of some peculiar animalcute which caused a red
deposit : he found it in lakes and springs near Askerne, in the dropping-well at
Knaresborough, and other places situated on or near the great tract of magnesian
limestone in that district. He enumerated a series of experiments, instituted with
a view of investigating the source of sulphuretted hydrogen, from which he came
to the conclusion, that it arose from the decomposition of the sulphates in con-
tact with vegetable matter. In allusion to Prof. Daniell's experiments on the
waters from the African coast, the author stated, that Dr. Clem has recently de-
tected sulphuretted hydrogen to a very considerable extent in the sea-waters of the

British coast. Dr. Lankester is of opinion, that the elements for the production of

sulphuretted hydrogen are as abundant around our own island as on the coasts of
Africa, but it is not developed to so great an extent from the want of a high de-
gree of heat. He did not think sulphuretted hydrogen and malaria identical.

An Inquiry into the Nature and Properties of the new Element, or product of
  Electrical Actioji mentioned by Schonbeiii, By Frederick De Moleyns,

   M.A.,F.G.S.,F.L.S.

   The author stated, that the announcement made by Professor Schonbein of Basle,
respecting the production of a new element by the action of electricity, which he

called Ozone, early attracted his attention, in consequence of the author having, in
the course of his electrical researches, been struck by the singularity of the peculiar
odour which the power of the batteries he employed produced, to such a degree as to
determine him, if possible, to solve the mystery.

    In the Report alluded to, which was read at the Glasgow Meeting, Professor Schon-

--bein stated that the disengagement of the odorous substance depended, 1st, upon

the nature of the positive electrode ; 2nd, upon the chemical constitution of the elec-

trolytic fluid ; and 3rd, upon the temperature of that fluid. He added, that his expe-

riments went to show that well-cleaned gold and platina were alone capable of dis-
engaging the odoriferous principle, and that the more easily oxidable metals, as well

as chaxcoal, did not possess that property at all.
91 HEPOBT-- 1841.

--The results of the author's investigations fully proved 1st, that the disengagement

of the peculiar odour was not confined to the less easily oxidable metals ; 2nd, that
by certain arrangements all metals, when acting as positive electrodes, may be made

to develope the odoriferous principle ; 3rd. that certain positive metals, when not

acting as electrodes, will evolve this principle ; 4th, that charcoal forms no excep-

tion  to this rule                                           5th, that all substances, whether crystalline                                                                                                                           in structure      or other-
                                                          ;

wise, possessing the property of appearing luminous by friction, or of yielding sparks
when struck, likewise possess the property of discharging, under such circumstances,

the "peculiar odour;" 6th, that iron and nickel develope this principle much more

strongly than any other metal.

The author conceived that Schonbein's error, in stating that gold and platina alone

developed the odour, arose from the fact of his applying but one mode of evolving

the principle, namely, by using the substances on which he experimented as positive

electrodes in electrolytic fluids ; it was therefore clear that if, as he stated, gold and
platina only produced the odour when clean, it must have been next to an impossibi-

lity for the Professor to have evolved it from metals with surfaces more easily oxi-

dable, and therefore in a condition to conceal rather than develope so subtile an element.

There was no doubt of its evolution from all the metals employed by the Professor t
but it was clear that, immediately on its disengagement, combination ensued with

the particles of the film which enveloped the ill-cleaned surfaces of the inferior metals,

and thus that all evidence of its existence vanished.

The author, considering the possibility of such an obstruction to the disengage-

ment of the odour, contrived an apparatus, by means of which he applied friction to

the surfaces of the positive electrodes, and in every case found that the odour was

evolved more or less strongly. Schonbein's opinion, that ozone was the electro-

negative element of an electrolytic compound, existing not only in aqueous fluids, but

also in the atmosphere, made it a point of much importance to ascertain whether it

could be produced in dry air or in vacuo. The author stated that he devised various

expedients for the purpose of determining that interesting question. Having ob-

served the odour to be produced with great intensity at the points where contact

was made and broken in an electro-magnetic engine, when connected with the

battery, the author constructed an apparatus by which magnets were made to revolve

within a glass cylinder, in such a manner that the points of contact, and the pivots

whereon the axis turned, were all within it. The cylinder could be exhausted at

pleasure, or filled with dry air or gases                                                                                                                                                                          and efl'ectual  means were adopted  for pre-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

venting leakage. He thus obtained a vacuum, and operated also in dry air, collect-

ing the matters evolved over distilled water ; and by such modes he clearly proved

that ozone could not only he produced in a dry atmosphere, but also in a vacuum, mer-

curial, and common. In several instances, where distilled water had been admitted

into an exhausted tube connected with the glass cylinder containing the odour, there

was a much larger proportion of the tube unoccupied by the water, than calculation

gave as the maximum space for the residual air after exhaustion, thus proving that

ozone had been concentrated, or reduced to a substantial condition. On opening the

tubes the odour was extremely strong, and quickly diffused, causing the same sul-

phurous smell as that prevailing in a place struck by lightning.

These experiments, varied and frequently repeated with similar results, led the

author to the conclusion that the ozone of Schonbein, which he proposed, for

reasons which formed the subject of a future paper, to name Electrogen, must be

admitted into the list of supposed elements                                                                                                                                                                        that it was not,  as developed by Schon-
                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

present are considered, but which in reality are not, elementary.

The author added that he was still prosecuting those experiments, and hoped

shortly to be able to add considerably to the proofs already adduced as to the elemen-

tary condition of ozone, and its chemical properties.

   Mr. Tweedy mentioned, that about six months ago, a specimen was shown to
him by a respectable mineral dealer at Truro, of what he called molybdic silver.

--As, however, it was of a very fusible character-- melting before the blow-pipe readily,

even in the flame of a candle Mr. Tweedy conceived that bismuth must enter largely

into its composition, and sent a small specimen to Mr. Prideaux for examination.

who ascertained that it was nearly pure bismuth, he believed native. Some further
specimens satisfied Mr. Tweedy of its being natural, and not artificial, and of its

great value. It was found in a mine near Truro, in a large unproductive sparry
lode, and only in one spot.

On the Upper Silurian Hocks of Denbighshire. Sy J. E. Bowman, F,L.S.,

                                                 F.G.S.

The author commenced by referring to a paper 'On the Upper Silurian Rocks of the

Vale of Llangollen,' read by him at the Glasgow Meeting (See Report for 1840, p. 100),

and by stating that a partial re-examination of this district, and a survey of that large

portion of Denbighshire which lies between the vale of Clwyd and the river Conway,

during the present summer, have afforded him additional proofs of the soundness of the

arrangement he then proposed, and shown that it is applicable to the whole of Denbigh-

shire, notwithstanding some further new appearances still more difficult to reconcile with

the typical series of Mr. Murchison. The lofty hills on both sides the great valley of

the Dee as high up as Corwen, and all the county of Denbigh west of the vale of Clwyd,

except the hills of carboniferous limestone which accompany the upper beds, consist

altogether of upper Silurian rocks. On account of the absence of the Aymestry and

Wenlock limestones, the changes of sti-uctm-e, and the alterations produced by clea-

vage, Mr. Murchison 's subdivisions could not be adhered to. The author therefore

proposes to arrange the Denbighshire series in the following descending order :-rT-

--Upper Division. 1, 2, 3. Green and red sandstones and marly conglomerates, feet.

of the old red sandstone, the foSsils of the upper Ludlow rock ; and the more so, since
the old red sandstone itself is entirely wanting in North Wales, its nearest point to

   4 and 5. These beds are the true equivalents of the upper Ludlow rocks, and

generally do not differ much in appearance from the Shropshire type. Though

for the most part very barren of fossils, Terebraf.ula navicula, &c. have been found in
a few localities. They are often affected by strong cleavage, resembling some lower

ASilurians and however long exposed, usually retain their hardness and colour.

striking proof of their durability occurs in the bed of the Dee under Llangollen Bridge,
whose piers rest upon the native rock in the stream. This bridge was built in 1346,
yet after the lapse of five centuries the bed of the river is not now more than a foot
below what was then its ordinary level. Beds of this age form a broad belt to the
south and west of the carboniferous limestone range, and cap many hills of the lower

--division, north and west of the river Elwy.

hills on the south bank of the Dee between Llangollen and Corwen, and in a large

--portion of Denbighshire west of the vale of Clwyd.
   3. Slates and flags. This is by far the most important and valuable portion of
the North Wales Silurians, since it contains numerous quarries that are extensively

worked in the hills north and south of the vale of Llangollen, and in the district be-

tween the rivers Clwyd and Conway. They are not however so durable as the true

Carnarvonshire or Cambrian slates, becoming brown and rotten on long exposure, like
the " mudstones " of Shropshire, of which they are proved to be the equivalents, both

by their place in the general section, and by the large Orthocera and Cardiolae found

upon the surface of some of the flags. The lowest beds rest upon true fossiliferous

lower Silurian rocks.

In the chain of hills north of the great Holyhead road between Cerrig-y-Druidion

and Pentre Voilas, rocks of this section assume a new and very peculiar character.

They consist of numerous streaked beds of soft ferruginous schist, which soon crumbles

down into small fragments, and of intermediate beds of hard amorphous greywacke,

ten or twelve feet thick and several hundred feet apart in the upper part of the series,

forming the summits of the hills, and gradually diminishing in thickness downwards.

Collectively thej' cannot be less than 1200 or 1400 feet thick. As they occur on the

confines of two great centres of volcanic eruption to the south and west, and as the

beds along their whole line are everywhere thrown off from one or other of these cen-

tres, the author supposes that the greywacke beds have been formed by the mixture of

volcanic ashes with the sedimentary deposits ; and that after consolidation the schists
have been altered by long contact with heated matter, which in its struggles to escape

has first upheaved, and then burst through the surface ; those portions which covered
the immediate seat of the eruption having been altogether swept away, and the hills in

question forcibly tilted aside. This altered character gradually disappears to the

eastward of Cerrig-y-Druidion. All the lower division of the Denbighshire upper Si-

lurians is remarkable for the singular uniformity, parallelism, and streaked appeai'ance

of the beds                                                  for their freedom from twists and curvatures, and from cleavage ;                     for their

low angles of inclination, and for the general absence of organic remains. Their

total thickness is estimated at 3700 feet, and their parallelism and freedom from con-

tortion through so great a depth is attributed to the cessation of subterranean disturb-

ances through a long continued epoch ; a fact that would scarcely have been suspected
at so low a point in the scale of the sedimentary deposits. The streaked character is

supposed to be due to a slight admixture of felspar in some of the beds, which on

weathering acquires a paler hue, and which may have been derived from some distant

vent and diffused through the waters. Only one instance was met with of the beds

being thrown up into high angles. This was in the rugged district between Llangol-

len and the head of the vale of Clwyd, near the north-east end of the Berwyn range,

and exactly in the common line of strike of that and of two other independent moun-

tain chains. Here they converge as to a focus, and appear to have been upheaved
by so many distinct masses of pent up elements in their struggles to escape, which,

meeting in a common centre, have by their combined forces eiiected this tremendous

convulsion. 'J'he rocks are thrown into inconceivable disorder, the beds dipping at

all angles; along the whole extent of one mountain 1200 feet high and above half a

mile long, they are absolutely perpendicular, and seem to have been rifted and tossed

on end ]}\ one entire mass. It is in the midst of this scene of devastation that the

Dee " winds her wizard stream " through the vale of Llangollen ; but the harsher
features are worn down and concealed under the green slopes and hanging woods

which compose the rich scenery of this celebrated spot. The author then compared
the Denbighshire upper Silurians with their soft equivalents, the " mudstones " of

Montgomeryshire                                                                                   and showed their connection by instances of rocks of similar age,

but of an intermediate character, from other localities. The chief difi'erence is in the

lower division. The same species of fossils occur in the contemporaneous beds of

each portion in both districts, and in the same geological sequence, but very sparingly

in Denbighshire ;                                            also the same general parallelism and low angle  of dip                               the  same

character of the jointed structure; and the same tendency to concretions both in beds

and in detached hailstones.

The paper concluded by showing, from the altered appearance of the upper Silurian

group in North Wales compared with those of Shropshire, the still greater differences

that may be expected to occur in distant countries ; that little or no stress can there-

fore be laid on mere lithological structure ; but that as beds of the same age in widely

On the Post- Tertiary Formations of Cormvall and Devon. By Mr. Bartlett.

   Mr. Bartlett detailed the circumstances under which these formations are found in
Devon and Cornwall, consisting of raised beaches, drifted deposits in caverns, and fis-

sures in lime rocks, and of submarine forests. Mr. Bartlett mentioned, in addition
to the caves hitherto described, one named Ash Hole, in Berryhead ; it was thirty
yards long and six broad, and on the materials filling the cave lay four feet of loam

and earth, containing land-shells of the genera Helix and Cyclostoma ; also marine

shells, such as the Mytilus of the coast, bones of the domestic fowl, and human bones,

mixed with pottery and various implements ; below these were found abundant re-
mains of the elephant, and the usual cavern debris. In the lacustrine deposits he

mentioned, as of usual occurrence, the remains of oak, ash, elm, willow, maple, &c.

and of ferns and Zostera. These he considered as belonging to a later epoch than
the cavern animals, which could hardly have existed at the same time with vegetation

resembling that of the present day. He then described some of the usual characters

of the raised beaches, which vaiy in elevation from twenty-five to thirty-five feet above
sea-level, and consist of terraces of fine yellow siliceous sand, containing pebbles of

chert, limestone, old red sandstone, greenstone, hsmatitic iron ore, &c.; together
with abundance of shells, Purpura lapillus, Patella, Turbo, Nassa, Ostrea, &c. with

remains of Echinodermata, SepiadfP, and rarely of Gorgonite. These phenomena,

indicating changes in the relative level of land and sea, the author attributed to gal-

vanic action exerting itself along peculiar lines of geographical range, such as the
bottom of the British Channel, which had always been oscillating, from the earliest

tertiary era.

An Account of the Fossil Orgajiic Remains of the South-east Coast of Corn-
          ivall, and of Bodmin and Menheniott. By C. W. Peach.

The line of coast examined commences at Veryan, four miles south of Tregony, and

extends eastward by Gorran, the Blackhead, and Fowey, to East Looe. The cliffs

are composed throughout of quartzose and slaty rocks, hitherto supposed by Mr.

Conybeare and others, who have referred to them in their writings, to be destitute of

fossils. But along the whole line Mr. Peach has detected traces of Brachiopodous

shells and corals, and the stems of Encrinites are of frequent occurrence. From Ve-

ryan to Gorran the quartzose rocks rarely contain traces of shells, but in the calca-

reous slates in contact with dykes of greenstones at Blackhead, remains of corals re-

sembling Turhinolopsis, and of the genera Cyathocrinus, Spirifera and Orthoceras,

occur. Eastward, at Pridmouth, a fine specimen of the Platycrinite was found, with

the column, pelvis, arms, &c. In the slate quarries of Fowey, remains supposed to

be those of fish, and corals of the genus Favosites, were detected. Near Polruan en-

crinital stems nearly a foot long occur, together with remains of Tfilobites, corals of

the genera Cyathophyllum and Favosites, Spirifera, Orthoceras, and a fossil with

structure resembling that of the Sepiada. At Pentlooe an equal- valved bivalve, re-

sembling Nucula, and a species of Orihis, have been found                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          and at East Looe another

fine specimen of an Encrinite, with column, arms, and tentacula attached ; also spe-

cimens of Cyalhoci-inus, Fenestella, Turhinolopsis, and Orihis. At Bodmin the au-

thor had detected Encrinites in the slate quarries, and in those of Menheniott in

Liskeard, the eye of a Trilobite in good preservation. On the beach below the cliffs

at Port Mellin, near Mevagissey, the author observed traces of a lacustrine deposit,

containing roots and branches of trees, and the elytra of beetles, exposed after a

heavy gale.

On the Stratified and Unstratified Volcanic Products in the neighbourhood of

               Plymouth. By the Rev. D. Williams, F.G.S.

   Mr. Williams stated, that the prevalent association over the different regions of the

earth, of granite, gneiss, greenstones, porphyries, mica-, talc-, chlorite-, and clay-

slate, had f^or some time past induced him to suspect that such common assemblage
was not without its signification : recent observations in Devon and Cornwall had

convinced him, that there existed an intelligible relationship in the community of their

origin, viz. that they were all volcanic products. He would instance, first,' the gra-

nite veins in the bed of the Erme river, above Ivy Bridge, of which he exhibited a hori-
zontal section. He at first regarded them as veins which had been injected into the

yielding joints and fissures of the fine jaspery grit rock ; closer inspection showed him

also certain very delicate threads of the same flesh-coloured granite, emanating from

the larger joints, but ranging after the planes of deposition of the grit ; and the jas-

per rock was no more dislocated there than elsewhere. Higher up the river-bed he

came to what appeared a hard junction between the grit and the granite ; the former
Avas in a highly metamorphic condition, but its upper surface showed frequently that

its laminae of deposition had not been obliterated. Specimens of the altered rock,

obtained from the immediate confines of the hard junction line, showed no mineral

transition between the granite and the altered grit. He had observed below, that

while the grit showed no evidence whatever of having been acted on by any unusual

violence, most of the granite veins ranged in the direction of its normal joints.

Almost the first specimen he obtained from one of these joints (upwards of four feet

above the granite in mass) showed its walls to be perfectly granitified, the granitic

matter shading out laterally in the most delicate pencillings, while nearly all the other

joints afforded the same evidences of conversion, in a greater or less degree. From

these facts Mr. Williams felt constrained to deny that the granite had ever been for-

cibly injected, and to infer that the entire phsenomena might be better explained by

tranquil fusion and conversion. He contended that the pre-existing sedimentary

rock had been reduced and converted into granite by intense heat from within, tra-

versing the joint-lines in their several directions, and radiating from them laterally

among the laminae of deposition, apparently indicating, that wherever the temperature

amounted to its point of fusion, there the rock would be reduced to the same condi-

tion with the incandescent mass below. With regard to the elvans or greenstones,

and the so-called clay-slate or killas, he considered that abundant evidence existed

in Devon and Cornwall to show that they also Were volcanic products, the former id

their usual amorphous type, the latter in a stratified condition. On the shore of the

Padstow estuary, west of Wadebridge, fourteen of these elvans might be observed at

varying intervals, each one underlaid and overlaid by volcanic breccia, grit, ash and

clay-slate                                                         these  greenstones  all  observed the  same angle of dip, and precisely the
                                                                :

same strike as the killas above and below them ; indeed several of them are disclosed
on the opposite side of the river, in the precise places which the direction of strike

would have indicated, and there also tilted up at the same angle with the clay-slates

above and below. This line of low cliif extends about a mile, the slates and elvans

having a permanent southern dip, with one undulating exception. There, fourteen

submarine lava-streams occupy perfectly distinct levels in the vertical scale, each one

representing its own period of eruption, during a greater or less interval of time,

and each one apparently preceded or accompanied by ejected fragmentary matter

by grit, ashes and mud, the greenstones being very commonly based upon a grit or

breccia, at other times upon an ash or slate, each of them appearing to pass insensi-

bly into the other. Mr. Williams particularly directed attention to the coast round

Saltash, in the immediate vicinity of Plymouth, or from Redding Point to the great

mass of porphyry near the fishing-houses, which was one uninterrupted series of va-

rieties of volcanic ash, oftentimes passing into clay-slate, interstratified among the

thick red sandstone beds seen on the east and west cliff's of the Sound. The lower

beds of this sandstone Mr. Williams observed to be traversed by four north and south

dykes, which cut the beds at right angles, and filled with the same rejectamenta that

he had observed to constitute the partings between the sandstone beds ; these he sup-

poses may have been the vomitories through which the mud or ashes were blown out,

as it was an interesting fact, that these ash-dykes did not traverse the more southern

beds, but were overlaid and concealed by them.

On the discovery of Organic Remains, in a raised beach, in the Limestone

      Cliff under the Hoe at Plymouth. By E. Moore, M.D., F.L.S.

   The raised beach discovered under the Hoe by the Rev. Richard Hennah, has

lately, by the extension of the quarry near which it was situated, been almost en-
tirely removed, and in the progress of the work, it was ascertained to occupy a de-
pression in the face of the limestone cliff, 100 feet wide and forty deep : its base is
thirty-five feet above the present sea at high water spring tides ; it runs upwards and
backwards twenty feet, inclining inwards with the slope of the rock, and is covered by

ten feet of gravel, thus making its entire elevation sixty-five feet above the present
sea level. It is composed of fragments of rocks of the neighbouring shore, such as
limestone, slate, red sandstone, and reddish porphyry, together with quantities of
granitic sand, which is arranged in consolidated horizontal layers or false bedding
with intervals of loose sand; a few shells (Patella and Euccinum) have been found
in it ; and recently, on its upper part, ten feet below the surface of the present soil,
were discovered bones and teeth of the elephant, rhinoceros, bear, horse and deer; also

caudal vertebree of the whale, and the lower valve of a large oyster.
   The quantity of fragments of leg-bones amounted to several bushels, being exceed-

ingly fragile, and deprived of their animal matter; the whale's vertebrae and bear's

tusks appeared much worn, as if by long-continued friction in water. Above and to

the west of this deposit, eighty-eight feet from the present sea, is another accumulation
of rounded quartz pebbles, ironstone, and sandstone, imbedded in a matrix of white
clay, apparently differing altogether in character from the former, and assimilating

to the deposits noticeable higher up the country about Barnstaple. The author de-
scribed a continuation of the same accumulation several hundred feet to the west-
ward, on a level with its lower line, composed of rounded masses of large size,
mixed with sea-sand, containing numerous fragments of Purpura, Patella, Buccinum,
&c., all similar to the Mollnsca of the present sea ; and then mentioned numerous in-

stances of similar deposits occurring all around the shores of the harbour of Plymouth.
Nearly the entire collection of bones was similar to those formerly obtained from the
limestone caverns of Oreston,Yealm Bridge, Kitley, and Kent's Hole, all in this county.
Dr. Moore inferred that the beach must have existed as such at the time when the ani-
mals of the caverns were in a living state : that it was really originally washed by the

sea, he considered proved by the rounded form of the vertebrae of the whale and many

of the bones ; and from the marine shells deposited in it he believed that there must
have been an elevation of the land at some former period, taking place slowly, not by

any sudden convulsion, likely to destroy the animals then existing.

the limestone, but they were interspersed with blue shillat slates, similar to those

which occur above it. From the circumstance of the slate rocks immediately below

the red sandstone being in each instance tinged red, the author imagined that their

colour might in these cases, if not in all, arise from the iron of the red bands affecting

them by percolation. He next remarked, that from the alternations of slate and lime-

stone, the former appearing, from a consideration of the section, to come up in wedges

through the latter, it might be possible that the opinion that some of the Plymouth
limestones might have been formed in a manner analogous to the modern coral reefs

was founded on correct data, although in many other localities in the vicinity the bands

belong to the same uninterrupted sei-ies of deposits. The quantity of water obtained

Notice of a series of Specimens from Mr. Johnsons Granite Quarries, near

  Prince Town, Dartmoor. By the Rev. Dr. Buckland, D.D., F.R.S.

   To the depth often or twenty feet the granite is more or less decomposed ; surface
granite of this kind has too frequently been employed, because it was cheapest ; and
the result is, that after a few years' exposure to a damp and foggy climate, as in the

case of the prisons on Dartmoor, the decomposing granite becomes like a spongy

mass, absorbing water continually, unless the walls constructed of it are externally

covered with Roman cement or tiles. This defect is inseparable from granite, which

is not quarried from a depth beyond the influence of decomposition. At the bottom

of the Foggin Tor quarries a mass of virgin granite is laid open to a great extent,

which is entirely free from this influence ; and from hence the beautiful granite is
obtained v.-hich is now in use for Lord Nelson's monument in Trafalgar Square.

Dr. Buckland also exhibited a mass of amethystine quartz, from Dartmoor. He

next described Earl Morley's quarries of potter's clay near Shaw, seven miles north
of Plymouth. Here the surface, over hundreds of acres, consists of decomposed

white felspar, which is purified by passing streams of water over it, and affords a fine

porcelain clay of unusual purity, from which ornamental figures, &c. may be made,

and which is largely exported to the potteries. Specimens of the decomposing fel-

spar, and the porcelain prepared from                                                                   it, were  exhibited  by  Dr.  Buckland                                              also  fire-
                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

bricks made from the same clay in its natural state, which resist a stronger heat

than Stourbridge bricks in the black bottle-glass furnaces.

   On analysis, the Morley clay gives only silica, alumina, and water. The decom-

posing granite of the Morley Clay Works closely resembles that near St. Austle in
Cornwall. Like the decomposed granite of Carcluse, near that town, it is also in
some parts abundantly traversed by minute veins and insulated crystals of tin ore.

   Dr. Buckland also exhibited water-pipes of a cheap kind, made from the coarser
strata of decomposed granite that accompany the tertiary brown-coal at Bovey Heath-
field, near Newton Bushell.

   Mr. Dawson exhibited a model of the Great Landslip of Axmouth, which took place
at Christmas, 1839. It was constructed on a scale of 120 feet to the inch, and repre-
sented a mile and a quarter. According to Mr. Dawson, the length of the chasm
caused by this subsidence was 1000 yards, the breadth 300 yards, and the depth 130
to 210 feet; 22 acres were sunk in the chasm.

Mr. S. P. Pratt exhibited specimens, supposed to be from the slaty rocks over-

lying the limestone of Mount Batten ; they were derived from blocks lying on the

beach close to  the  black  shales                              one                                     piece was  in  contact with   the  bed                                              containing
                                                             ;

Encrinites. They contained several species of plants and scales of fish.

   Major Harding read a notice of the discovery of some fossils on Great Hangman

Hill, near Combemartin, North Devon. They consist of shells in the state of casts,
and appear in large detached and ferruginous masses of quartzose rock, ranged on the
surface. Major Harding has also observed a similar formation in the valley of rocks

near Linton.

Mr. J. C. Bellamy exhibited a collection of Devonian fossils, containing about

150 species, and a printed table of genera, showing the various localities in which

--they were obtained
                                                                                                     ;
                     he stated the relative abundance of groups of fossils in these I'ocks,

as occurring in the following order : Polypiaria, Crinoideaj Conchifera, Cephalopoda,

Gasteropoda, and Crustacea.

On the Occurrence of some minute Fossil Crustaceans in Palceozoic Rocks.

 dance of minute Crustaceans belonging to the same group with the Cypris, a small,
bivalvular, pencil-footed animal, abounding in shallows of fresh water, where the
warmth of the sun and abundance of decaj'ing vegetable and animal matter conduce
to their rapid multiplication. Beside these, there is a marine group called Cythera,
and it is not easy to determine to which of these groups the fossil species belong ; and
in consequence the marine or fluviatile origin of the strata in which they occur is not
always safely determinable from their occurrence. In the Weald of Sussex, and in
the tertiary beds, their identification with the freshwater group is probably correct
but they occur also in situations not hitherto expected, and where the evidence re-
mains to be examined. In the coal-shales of Yorkshire, which are 4000 feet thick,
there occurs a band of marine shells, such as Goniatites, Orthoceras, and Pectens,
without one freshwater shell, and above and below it, beds with indications, by shells,
of fluviatile, if not decidedly freshwater origin ; and the author noticed in 1831, that
Cyprides occur mixed with the freshwater shells above the marine deposit. Dr. Hib-
bert described in 1834, to the British Association at Edinburgh, what he conceived to
be freshwater Cyprides in the limestones of Bardie House ; and in 1836 Mr. Phillips
discovered vast abundance of Cyprides in the limestone of the upper coal-measures at
Ardwick, north of Manchester, and immense numbers in black shales of the Bradford
Collieries; and Mr. Binney has since found them in a great variety of situations.

To the Dublin Geological Society (1840) Mr. M'Coy has announced thirteen or four-

teen species in the mountain limestones of Kildare, which are full of marine organic
remains. Mr, Phillips had lately observed in Pembrokeshire, in the lowest shales of
the mountain limestone, within ten feet of the old red sandstone, beds of Cyprides
very similar to those in the black shales of the upper coal-measures in Manchester.
These are probably the most ancient specimens of the group yet discovered. The
circumstances under which these Crustaceans are found at the present day appear to
agree with those attending their occurrence in a fossil state ; the recent Cyprides
seem destined to consume the perishing parts of animal and vegetable substances
and the fossil species are generally associated with portions of fishes near Manchester,
as observed at Ardwick by the author, and elsewhere by Mr. Binney, and by Dr.
Hibbert at Burdie House. In Caldey Island they are in like manner associated with

bone- and fish-beds. Probably their remains occur under many circumstances ; but
to ascertain all the conditions under which they lived, requires attention to many
sorts of strata not often suspected to contain remains. Very remarkable conditions
occurred when the old red sandstone ceased to be deposited ; for then, after a long
series of formations vvith no trace of organic remains, we find in the beds imme-

diately above thousands of minute Crustaceans, bone-beds, layers of Brachiopoda, &c.,

of marine origin ; and, encouraged by this example, we may expect to find them in

beds of still higher antiquity.

   Mr. J. Phillips remarked the fact of these cypridiform Crustaceans constituting the
general type of Enfomosfraca through a large range of the strata, being in the older
or palaeozoic rocks unaccompanied by decapodous Crustaceans, which lie in later de-
posits, but flanked by a parallel series of Trilobites, which are absent from those
newer strata,

On the genus Cardinia, Agassiz, as characteristic of the Lias Formation.

                     By H. E. Strickland, F.G.S.

Mr. Strickland called attention to a genus of bivalve Mollusca which is peculiarly

characteristic of the Liassic series. This genus, wliich was named Cardinia by M.

Agassiz in the ' Etudes critiques sur les Mollusques fossiles,' has also been termed

Pachyodon by Mr. Stutchbury, and Ginorga by Mr. J. E. Gray. It appears to belong

to the Venerida, and in external form approaches Pnllastra, but is distinguished by

possessing, in addition to the converging cardinal teeth, a pair of very strong lateral

ones analogous to those of Cardium. From the ovate form of the shell and the struc-

ture of the hinge, the species of this genus have been referred by most authors to the

Unionidce, but are sufficiently distinguished \ty the lunule beneath the umbo, and by

their marine habitat, as proved by the other fossils found in company with them.

Ten or t\^elve species are known of this genus, the whole of which occur either in

the marlstone or the lower lias. Seven of these species were exhibited; but as it was

understood  that  Mr.  Stutchbury                          proposed  publishing a  monograph of  the genus,

Mr. Strickland abstained from naming them before he had communicated with Mr.
Stutchbury. The best known type of the genus is C. Listen ( Unio Listeri, Sow. Min.

from the lias, the property of Mr. Gibbs of Evesham, figured in Mag. Nat. Hist.

On the Geological Changes produced by the Saxicava rugosa in Plymouth

                           Sound. By W. Walker.

   The Saxicava rugosa appears to be the prevailing perforator of the limestone rocks
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

and it is the author's opinion that these operations have been carried on during such

long periods as to "destroy rocks, and make deep water where shoals previously ex-

isted." The different places in which the perforations had been extensive, or might

be most advantageously examined, were described. Tlie blocks of Portland stone,

to which the buoys were formerly attached, were in two or three years punctured

on the surface and also deeply perforated by the Saxicava ; and in the sea-walls of
Devonport dockyard, also of Portland stone, below the low-water level of spring

tides, the stone is honeycombed and frittered away. Between the Devil's Point and

Mount Edgecumbe the channel is 200 feet wide, and three or four times deeper than

in the Sound. In using the diving-bell to cut away rocks in this channel, in order

to form the sea-walls of the Royal William Victualling Yard, the limestone was found

much perforated, and rocks brought up by the trawl from twenty and twenty-five

fathom water were also perforated. The sides and bottom of this channel are of

limestone, and the rapidity of the current keeps its suiface clear ; wherever this is the
case, throughout the Sound, the bottom is found perforated by the Saxicava. The

author then proceeds to show, that throughout the Sound there is a greater depth of

water over the limestone rocks than over the red sandstone, and he attributes this

degradation to the boring of Saxicava. The rocky shoals lying southward of a Hne

drawn from Mount Edgecumbe through Drake Island to Mount Batten are com-

posed of red sandstone, and lie from twelve to seventeen feet beneath the level of low-

water spring tides. The depth of water over the anchorage, within the Breakwater,

varies from twenty-seven to thirty-six feet ; but immediately on passing the boundary-

line of the sandstone, northward, the water becomes deeper, and where the rapidity

of the tidal current prevents deposits of mud or sand, the depth varies from fifty to

one hundred and twenty feet over the limestone

The limestone hills around Plymouth were next described ; and it appears that

their elevation is generally less than that of the surrounding sandstone. These lime-

stone heights at Stonehouse, Plymouth, Mount Batten, and Oreston, are nearly of

the same elevation                                                                     raised beaches, rounded pebbles, and water-worn surfaces, fur-
                                                                                    ;

nish evidence of their having been once under water. Near the north-west corner

of Drake Island is a small portion of limestone on a level with the ordinary high

water, bearing traces of the perforations of Saxicava                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       and the rocky cliffs near Ply-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

mouth Citadel, from the low-water mark of spring tides, up to fifteen or twenty feet

above high- water level, bear evidence of the same ravages ; and at fifteen or twenty
feet above the sea is a conglomerate mass of pebbles, sand and shells, and some

limestone pebbles, perforated by Saxicava. At low-water mark are the animals

in their holes, higher up their empty shells are seen, and above high water their

perforations only are to be found. In the limestone in Hoe lake the author very

recently found perforations by the Pholas, one hundred feet above the level of low-

water spring tides. The situation was protected from atmospheric influence by a

coating of earth and vegetation. From these circumstances the author inferred that

all the limestone rocks around Plymouth were under water within the period during

which the Saxicava was the great agent in the destruction of the rocks. In some cases

the rocks are protected from these ravages by a coating of Balaiii, &c., which cover the

rock                    and in other  places                                           deposits  of mud  and  sand  are formed                                                                                                                                                              over the  rocky  bottom,
                     ;

and there the operations of Saxicava and Pholas necessarily cease. Since the Break-

water was erected, the water over the rocks near the Citadel has been diminishing in

depth, from the accumulation of mud and sand, and an anchorage is forming where

nothing but rocks previously existed. In conclusion, the author refers to the ope-

rations of boring shells on the mole of Castel a Mare in the Bay of Naples, and on

other artificial structures, and suggests to engineers employed in the erection of pub-

such structures below the ordinary level of low water at spring tides.

   The first was in length thirty-six feet, being at the rate of three feet to the mile.
The others were enlarged sections of four portions of the railway, made on the scale
of forty feet to one inch. One of these represented a cutting one mile in length
at Saltfovd, through the successive strata of the lias formation. This cutting was
described by detailed sections on the scale of four feet to the inch ; each bed is
noticed with, as far as possible, its included organic remains. The subdivisions
are, the upper marl upon upper and lower blue limestones fifty-eight feet, ivhite
limestones twenty-four feet, and lower marl twenty-seven feet ; which latter were
shown, by means of sinking a pit, to rest upon new red marls. Drawings of certain
fossils were added. Three other enlarged views of the Pennant strata were given,

with further details, in sections on a scale varying from twenty to ten feet to the inch.
Drift beds were noticed containing water-worn fragments of sandstone, broken stems
of plants {Sigillaria and Lepidodendron), with rolled pieces of perfectly formed coal;

also conglomerates of broken coal. Drawings were made of two large Sigillaria taking
origin in a bed of coal; and a portion of two large slabs of the Pennant sandstone,
showing very regular ripple-marks. Various other geological phEenomena deemed

worthy of attention were displayed on the sections.

A Letter was read from T. B. Jordan, of the Museum of Economic GeO'

                logy, ' On Copying Fossils by a Galvanic Deposit.'

   In applying the method ordinarily used in electrotyping, some difficulty v^^as expe-
rienced by the author in consequence of the irregular form of the fossils, parts of
which would not relieve from the wax or plaster matrix in which the copper is after.»
wards deposited. Mr. Jordan therefore adopted a compound of glue and treacle (used
by printers for their inking-rollers) as the material of the moulds, the elasticity of
which admitted of its leaving the adherent portions without breaking. The mixture
is applied hot, and allowed to harden for twenty-four hours, when it will come oiF
without injuring the finest parts. The matrix thus prepared requires a strong varnish
to protect the back and sides from the action of the liquid in which it is to be placed,
and only one copy can be made from each matrix ; but the impressions have none of
the defects so apparent in those produced in the ordinary moulds. Different lights
and shades may be given to the copper impressions by a galvanic process, which the
author considers capable of improvement and application to other purposes. For a
dark object on a light ground the surface is brushed over with the argento-cyanide

of potassium, giving it a silver face, which may be removed to the desired extent from

the portions requiring to be dark, by a dilute solution of nitro-muriate of platina.

Other tints may be produced by using a solution of gold ; and all may be consider-

ably varied by changing the time during which each solution is allowed to act.
[Specimens of the electrotype copies of Trilobites and other fossils were exhibited.]

                  ZOOLOGY AND BOTANY.

On the Zoology of the County of Cormoall, By Jonathan Covcii,F.L.S., 8fc.

Of the fourteen or fifteen species of Cheiroptera enumerated as British by Mr.

Bell, six are included in the Cornish fauna, and one more ( V. discolor) has been
found at no greater distance than Plymouth. Of the remainder, eight are too limited,

in numbers and distribution, to enter into a calculation of comparison with other

parts of the kingdom. The commonest of the Cornish Bats are, the Pipistrelle, Lesser

Horse-shoe, and Long-eared, in the order in which they are enumerated ; but their
local occurrence depends more on the accident of their meeting with congenial haunts,

than on the mere influence of climate. The latter circumstance, however, produces

its effect on the habits of these animals ; so that in Cornwall, where what may be de-

nominated severely cold winters do not occuf moz-e frequently than in cycles of six or

eight years, the appearance of the bat may be witnessed in every week in an ordinary

Ayear.   fall below the 40th degree of the thermometer is the signal for their retreat

but a slight change to a milder temperature restores them to activit)^ when not un-

commonly they may be seen at midday in search of prey, which might not be obtained

at the more usual hours of the evening.

It may be regarded as another proof of the mildness of the climate, that the Long-

tailed Field Mouse {Mus sylvaticus) breeds at Christmas, or the very beginning of

January, forming its nest at this time in ricks of hay. The frog also is rarely later

than this period in depositing its spawn.

Of the genus Sorex, Cornwall possesses three species, sufficiently distinguished.

These are, Sorex araneus, Jenyns, in the Mag. of Zoology, vol. ii. : the front teeth

of a deep brown through most of their length. Bell's Br. Q., p. 109. Another
species, S. araneus of Duvernoy and Jenyns, Mag. Zool. vol. ii. f. 1. : the snout not so

long as  in the  S. araneus of English authors                                                                                                                                         the teeth brown  only at  the tips of

the lower front teeth and of the molars. A third is referred to S. Fodiens of Bell,

S. bicolor of Jenyns, Mag. Zool, vol. ii. p. 37, but differing in some particulars ; more
especially in having the under front teeth purely white, the upper slightly coloured.

Of birds, there are known in Cornwall 243 species; of fishes, 1/3; of stalk-eyed

Crustaceans, 67.

The additions to the zoology of the West of England which this enumeration im-

plies, with those belonging to the radiate animals, will be given in a second part ef

   The author exhibited a drawing of the palate of an individual of Balxnoptera minor
(Knox), taken off Plymouth, and showed a portion of the baleine, and a part of the
ear of that animal. He showed a new species of Vole, taken at Yealmpton. He also dis-
played a tooth of an extinct species of elephant, from the Yealm Bridge cavern; a
species of Asterias unknown to him ; a species of Helix new to the British isles ; some
Helices from the Yealm Bridge cave (proving their modern date) ; the skull of Ar-
vicola ayrestis, having teeth with fangs, instead of the common fluted condition ; and
several curious relics of ArvicolcB, birds, fish, &c. from the cavern of Yealm Bridge,
which he discovered.

determination of the localities of the Australian animals, for almost all the specimens

are marked as coming from New Holland. This is not only the case with the speci-

mens contained in the museums, but also with respect to the observations of some recent
voyagers. Having recently received at the British Museum a complete series of all

the Mammalia collected by Mr. Gould duraig his visit to Australia, and of tliose sent

from his collector, Mr. Gilbert, from Western Australia, all tlie specimens of which

were marked at the time they were collected, I have been induced to draw up a few

remarks on the geographical distribution of these animals. From these materials, and

others at my command, I believe there are at present known ninety species of Mam-

maha found in Australia, belonging to thirty-six genera: of these, seventy-seven spe-

cies, belonging to twenty-one genera, are marsupial, three species and two genera are

monotrematous, and twenty-three species and twelve genera are non-marsupial ; eight

of these twenty-three species and four genera are Bats belonging to the order Pri-

mates                             two species belonging to two genera of Feres or carnivorous beasts, as the Dog
                               ;

and the Seal ; and the remaining eleven species, referable to four genera, are Mice be-

longing to the Glires, and two to CetcB, or Whales. Of these thirty-three genera found in

Australia, seven, as ChcBropus,Acrohates,Petanrista, Lagochestes, Phascolarctos, Pseu-

domys, and Harpalotis, are peculiar to New South Wales. Petaurus might be placed

in the same group ; but a single species is also found in Norfolk Island, where it is

the only known beast. It is by some supposed to have been introduced from Sidney,

especially as it is not found in Van Diemen's Land. The genera Betloiiyia and Pe-

trogale are only found in New South Wales, South Australia, and the north coast ; and

the genus MyriHecobius is peculiar to Western Australia ; so that these ten genera are

pecuHar to the Australian continent. The genera Thylacinus, Diabolus, and Dromicea

are peculiar to Van Diemen's Land. The genera, Dasyurus wadi Perameles are com-

mon to Van Diemen's Land and the continent, but much more abundant in the former.

The genera Nyctophilus, Phalangista, Phascogale, Hepoona, Macropus, Habnaturus,

Hypsiprymniis, and Hydromys, appear to be common to the continent of Australia

and Van Diemen's Land, as also appears to be the case with the genera Echidna and

Ornithorhynchus; hut the tv!0 latter genera have not yet been discovered in South'

Austraha. There are some species found in Australia which belong to genera, as

Pteropus and Rhinoloplnis,                                                                                                                    which are found in different parts of the  Old World                                                                and

others, as Canis, Mas, Scotojjhilus, and Alolossits, which are common to it and both

hemispheres.                      One  genus,  Halinaturus,                                                                                   has  a  species  found  in  New Guinea                                                                         but  most
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

     On a New Glirine Animalfrom Mexico. Hy J. E. Gray, F.IR.S,

   The British Museum having lately received from Mr. John Phillips, of the Reale del
Monte Mining Company, a new glirine animal, which he brought from Mexico, I am
desirous of mentioning it before this meeting, not only on account of its being new to

our zoological catalogues, but also because it illustrates two interesting facts, one in
the geographical distribution of animals, and the other of certain genera being repre-
sented in different parts of the world by animals very similar in external appearance,
but yet possessing peculiar characters adapting them to their different localities.

   The animal before us is peculiar for having large cheek-pouches, which open ex-
ternally on the sides of the cheek. This conformation has only hitherto been ob-
served in four genera of glirine animals, which exclusively inhabit the northern half
of the American Continent, as the genera Saccophorus, Saccomys, xinthomys, and He-
teromys. These cheek-pouches are used by the animals to carry their food, as the
Monkeys of the Old World use their internal pouches which are found between their
cheeks and the mouths. The first of these genera has been long known ; and it has
been believed that their cheek-pouches hung out of the side of the cheek-like pockets

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

but this does not appear to be the case with the genus under consideration, or with

Anthomys, which was so called because M. F. Cuvier found their cheek-pouches filled

with flowers.
   If it was not for these cheek-pouches, the animal before us might be taken for a

Jerboa (Dipus), with which it perfectly agrees in the softness and colour of the fur,
and in the length of the hind legs and the tail, which has a brush at the end, so that

it may be at once distinguished from the other American genera above enumerated,

which either have an elongated scaly tail like a rat, or a very short one like a lemming.

I am therefore inclined to consider this animal as the American representative of the

genus Jerboa {Dipus), which is confined to the more temperate part of Africa, as the
genus Harpaloiis is the representative of the same genus in AustraUa. This combina-
tion of the forms and colour with the Jerboa, and with the external cheek-pouches of the
pouched rat, at once marks this animal as a new genus, which I propose to call Dipo-
domys, or Jerboa Rat, designating the species after its discoverer, Dipodomys Phillipii.

    Mr. Gray exhibited a skin of glove leather from Sweden, prepared from the skin
of the foetal Rein-deer by tanning with birch bark.

Account of a Thylacinus, the great Dog-headed Opossum, one of the rarest and

     largest of the Marsupiate family of Animals. By Professor Owen.

    At the present day this animal exists only in Van Diemen's Land, though formerly it
had a much more extensive geographical distribution. For his knowledge of the ana-
tomy of this animal, Mr. Owen stated that he was indebted to Sir John Franklin, who
had kindly preserved and sent him a specimen in spirit, and he believed this was the

only specimen extant in Europe. In its habits it was carnivorous ; holding about the
same relatiozi to the other Marsupialia that the digitigrade Carnivora did to the placental
Mammalia. It was a great pest to the shepherd in its native districts ; and in its low

intellectual character, and its craft and cunning, very much resembled the wolf. In de-
stroying sheep it does not feed on them at once, but proceeds to worry, if possible, the

whole flock, first tearing one and then another. Its smell is very powerful. It has a
narrow head, a large number of incisor teeth, with the molars more numerous and'uni-
form in size and shape than in the wolf. The incisors are of equal length and regularly
 arranged in the segment of a circle, with an interspace in the middle of the series of
both jaws. The external incisors on each side are the strongest. The laniary or canine
 teeth are long, strong, curved and pointed, like those of the dog tribe. The spurious
 molars in this, as in all other Marsupials, have two roots ; their crown presents a simple
 compressed conical form, with a posterior tubercle, which is most developed in the hind-

most. The true molars in the upper jaw are unequally triangular, the last being much

 smaller than the rest; the exterior partof the crown is raised into one large pointed mid-
 dle cusp and two lateral smaller cusps obscurely developed ; a small strong obtuse cusp
projects from the inner side of the crown. The molars of the lower jaw are compressed,
 tricuspidate, the middle cusp being the longest, especially in the two last molars, which
resemble closely the sectorial teeth (dents carnassiers) of the dog and cat. The fol-

lower organization than any of the Carnivora of Europe. Its internal organization
agrees with that oi Dasyunis and Phascogale, being, as in these carnivorous Marsu-
pials, destitute of a CEecum : it differs from Dasyurus and resembles Phascogale in ha-
ving the internal condyle of the humerus perforated. It has the pouch so decidedly
characteristic of the whole order of these animals. The reason of the existence of this

pouch may be to enable the animal to carry its young great distances more easily, as it
was obliged to travel far, in seasons of drought, in search of water. The pouch is usually

limited to the female ; but in Thylacinus a rudiment of the pouch exists in the full-
grown male.

  Notices and Drawings of three new Genera of Marine Fishes from Van

             Diemen's Land. By J. Richardson, M.D., F.R.S,

    1st. Nemadactyltis, or Thread-finger. This acanthopterygian genus agrees with
 Cheilodactybis in the lower rays of the pectoral fin being simple, with one prolonged
beyond the others, and in the general form of the body ; but differs from the percoid
family in general in the perfectly unarmed gill-covers, feeble dentition, and scombe-
roid character of all the scales below the lateral line. The fauces, palate and tongue are

smooth, the margin of the mouth exhibiting a single row of slender minute teeth.
The intermaxillary pedicles are short, the gill-rays only three ; the pyloric cseca like-
wise three, and the spinal vertebrae thirty-four. The only species known is named N.
concinnus, and but one specimen was obtained. Length 3^ inches. Its stomach con-

tained fragments of malacostraca.
    2nd. Latris has a mcenoid aspect, but differs from the rest of that group in the in-

ferior half of the pectoral rays being simple, and in the combination of certain cha-

racters, which, though existing, and indeed rather characteristic of the family, are not
all found in any one genus. It is most nearly allied to Cheilodactylus. The species

described is named Latris hecateia, or Six-banded Trumpeter. Two species of this

genus appear to be represented in Nos. 204, 205, and 209 of the drawings made on

Cook's second voyage at New Zealand : they bear the MS. names of Scicena lineata

and Scieena ciliaris. The drawings do not exhibit the structure of the pectorals di-
stinctly, yet the other details are so correct, that there seems to be no reason for doubt-
ing their position in the genus Latris. Scitjsna lineata has the precise markings of L.
hecateia, the species described in this paper, and may be identical with it. The Van
Diemen's Land fish is named the Trumpeter by the colonists, and is esteemed as their
best fish. The figure 205 above referred to has the word " sapidissimiis " written be-
neath it in Forster's hand.

    3rd. Hoplegnathus, a scaroid fish, departing greatly from the usual aspect of the fish
of this family. In dentition and form of the jaws this genus approaches more
nearly to the typical Scari than to Odax. But the scales of the body are small, the
bases of the vertical fins are densely scaly, with fillets of minute scales stretching up
between the rays. The spinous rays are very unlike the flexible ones of Odax, being
stronger than is usual even in Scarus, and the lateral line is continuous. This fish
was brought to England by the surgeon of a convict ship, but as he is since dead,

the locality in which it was taken cannot be now ascertained.

    Full descriptions, with figures of these fish, are to be published in the forthcoming
volume of the Transactions of the Zoological Societj\

    On the Habits of the Eel, and on the Freshwater Fish of Austria. JBy

                                Captain Widdrington, R.N.

   The author stated that his attention was drawn to the subject by a remark of Mr.
Yarrell in his work on British Fishes, in which he ascribes the deficiency of eels in the
Danube to the excessive susceptibility of the eel to cold. The author had seen eels
at Wurzburg on the Mayn, where the average degree of cold is quite as great as that
of the Danube. They also exist in the Elbe, at a point where that river would also be
colder than the Danube. They exist undoubtedly in the higher branches of the
Danube, but not in the delta. This, the author thinks, may be ascribed to the na-
ture of many of the waters which fall into the Danube, which, being alpine in their
--72 REPORT 1841.

character, possess little nutriment fit for the nourishment of the fish. Most alpine
streams are composed of melted snow or rain- water, and possess few constituents that
will afford nutriment to fish, more especially the eel, and thus their absence may he
easily accounted for. The same remarks apply to the Rhine, which is comjiletely al-
pine in its character till it reaches the Moselle. The author announced that Prof.

Heckel was about to publish a work on the freshwater fishes of Austria, which would
contain some new genera and a large number of new species.

   Dr. T. Thomson exhibited two living specimens of Lepidosiren which he had taken
in Macartney Island, on the Upper Gambia. They were found lying imbedded
in a hole in the rock, from which they could only be removed by a hammer. They
were almost covered with a coat of mud, which one of the specimens still retained.

   Dr. Tripe exhibited some specimens of Pontia. In their marking they resembled

P. Rapm and P. Napi, but were very much smaller. In some points of structure
they differed from the large species. The club of the antennie was less abrupt, and
the wings were more square in their form. They had only been found during very
hot and dry summers in one locality near Whitsand Bay, In wet seasons they were
never seen. They were mostly found feeding on the blackberry.

    On two remarkable Marine Invertebrata inhabiting the JEgean Sea.
                              By E. Forbes, F.L.S.

    These animals were taken in the harbour of Nousa, in the island of Paros, which is

extremely rich in marine productions. The depth of the bay is generally from seven

to  ten fathoms                                                       the bottom sand and  weed.  The animals differ according to bottom
                                                                   ;

and depth. Amongst the sandy heaps at the bottom of this bay are two new animals.

The first a zoophyte of the family ActiniadcB, which is free and vermiform, and which

--lives in a tube of its own construction, a combination of characters hitherto unnoticed

among the helianthoid polypes. The second is a tubicolar annelide, which lives in a

strong gelatinous tube, bearing a remarkable analogy to the sac of certain Entozoa.

These two animals are noticed together, as in each case the peculiarity of the organi-

zation and habits is the result of a similar adaptation of form, in two very distant tribes,

to a similar locality. In the absence of works of reference, the author abstained from

giving names to these animals, although he believed them to be new, both generically

and specifically.

On Deposits in Springs, Rivers, and Lakes, from the existence of Infusoria.

                            By E. Lankester, M.D.

   Dr. Lankester communicated some additional observations on the existence of or-

ganic beings in mineral waters. He had found the Conferva nivea of Dillwyn in the
sulphur spring on the river Leith near Edinburgh. He had also found it in the wells of

Moffat in Dumfries-shire, Gilsland in Northumberland, and Middleton and Croft in
Yorkshire. At Moffat he found great quantities of the substance called glairine, and
was convinced of its organic nature. At Moffat also he found a pink deposit in the
drains outside the wells, and on submitting it to the action of the microscope, he found

that it was produced by an animalcule, but much smaller in size than those which pro-
duced the coloured sediments of Harrowgate and Askern. It had the characters of a
Monas, and was not more than TTws-'h of an inch in diameter.

            On Cecidomyia Tritici. By Prof. Henslow, F.R.S.                                                                               I

    Prof. Henslow invited the co-operation of members in his attempts at perfecting

the natural history of the Wheat-Midge {Cecidomyia Tritici). He stated that he had
not been able to breed a single fly from many hundred larva; which he had procured

from the barns in his neighbourhood, during the winter months, by sifting the chaff
immediately after the corn had been dressed. Mr. Curtis had been equally unsuc-
cessful. The inquiry to which he was anxious to direct the attention of naturalists
was, whether the flics which appear in myriads during the first Aveek of June and then
deposit their eggs in the ears of wheat, have proceeded from larvae which had entered
the ground, and had there assumed the pupa state, or from larvae which were housed

in great profusion with the corn, and lay concealed in the ears. He considered it of

importance to determine this point correctly, as the possibility of checking the pest pro-

bably depended upon the result. 'Die Professor then exhibited specimens oiPuccinium

Uredo rosce ; and Phragmidiicm oblusum in connexion with Uredo potentUlee, for the

fungus                                  and also of showing generally, that many of the species referred to the genus

Uredo were probably only imperfect states of certain fungi belonging to Puccinium

and other allied genera.

      On the Colossal Sepiadge. By Col. Hamilton Smith, F.B.S.

   The author detailed what was known at the present day of the existence of ani-
mals of enormous size inhabiting the ocean, belonging to the class of Cephalopods.
However incredulous some naturalists might be with regard to the existence of these
animals, the author had collected sufficient evidence to convince him that animals of
a very large size belonging to this class now inhabited the waters of the ocean. The
paper was illustrated by numerous drawings, and one was a sketch of the beak and
other parts of an enormous Sepia, still preserved at the Museum of Haarlem, where

they were seen by the author.

ByProjet d'observations annuelles sur la Periodicite des Oiseaux.      M. Edm.

                                        DE Selys Longchamps.

   M. Quetelet, directeur de I'observatoire de Bruxelles, et Secretaire perpetuel de

I'Academie des Sciences de Belgique, vient de faire un appel a toutes les sciences phy-
siques pour etendre a leurs diverses branches le systeme d'observations periodiques
et comparatives qu'il a mis en pratique deja depuis longtemps en prenant pour point

de depart la meteorologie et le magnetisrae terrestre.

   La zoologie et la botanique devaient les premieres etre interrogees pour que Ton

put s'assurer chaque annee jusqu'a quel point les variations dans la constitution
meteorologique peuvent avancer ou retarder I'apparition de certains anirnaux, ou la

feuillaison et la floraison des plantes.

   Les naturalistes Beiges se sont empresses de realiser le desir du savant Astronome
en reconnaissant en outre combien ces observations, avec des dates precises, et repe-
tees pendant plusieurs ann^es, rendront plus exactes les moyennes que Ton cherche
a indiquer dans les faunes et les flores locales, je dirai plus, dans la faune generale
de I'Europe. Car si les zoologistes des diverses regions de cette partie du monde
repondent a notre appel, combien ne sera-t-il pas int^ressant de pouvoir tracer sur
une carte geographique le voyage annuel des Kirondelles, des Grues, et de tant d'au-
tres oiseaux voyageurs de long cours dont chacun de nous ne peut parler que vague-
ment faute d'observations comparatives.

    C'est dans ie but d'assurer la possibility de ces comparaisons que je crois utile
pour I'ornithologie, la branche dont j'ai a parler aujourd'hui, d'inviter serieusement
les ornithologistes a concentrer leurs observations sur un certain nombre d'especes
qui sont re'pandues dans toute I'Europe ou a peu pres. J'ai cru devoir pour cette
raison choisir des especes terrestres de preference aux aquatiques, parceque leurs mi-
grations s'etendent avec plusde regularite sur toutes les regions, et que leur determi-
nation est plus facile au point que lorsqu'on habite la ville on peut faire les observa-

tions par de simples chasseurs, tous ces oiseaux ayant un nom vulgaire dans les divers

dialectes Europeens. Je suis loin dc nier I'utilite d'observations semblables sur les
migrations des oiseaux d'eau, mais, je le n^pete, je crois que pour les premieres annees
on aurait peine (faute d'un assez grand nombre de stations) a recueillir des donnees
suffisantes pour en tirer des r^sultats generaux sur ces especes, qu'on ne trouve regu-
lierement que dans les grands marais ou sur les cotes maritimes.

    Je proposerai done d'etudier, a partir de 1842, la date precise des migrations des
40 especes suivantes, que Ton peut repartir en quatre sections. 1. Les oiseaux qui

viennent passer I'ete chez nous et y nicher, comme I'hirondelle et le rossignol. 2.
Ccux qui sont de passage regulier, mais qui ne font que passer sans s'arreter, comme

la grue et le pluvicr. 3. Les oiseaux qui sejournent tout I'hiver dans notre pays et

disparaissent pendant la belle saison, comme la corneille {Corvus comix) et le tarin

(Fringilla spinus). 4. Les oiseaux de passage accidentel ades epoques indeterminees.
--74 REPORT 1841.

comme le jaseur (Bombycilla garrula) et I'oiseau de tempete (Procellaria pelagica)
Je me suis depart! des principes mentionnes en iiidiquant cette derniere classed'oiseaux,

mais j'ai cru qu'il serait important de porter I'attention sur deux ou tiois especes dont

les causes d'apparition sent absolument inconnues, comme le jaseur, ou sont tout a

fait en rapport avec I'existence de tempetes maritimes, comme I'oiseau de tempete.

La premiere section sera, je pense, la meme pour toute I'Europe, mais il n'en sera pas

de meme des trois   autres                               ainsi dans  telle contree  comme en Hollande, par exemple, la

cigogne sera de la premiere, tandis qu'ailleurs, comme en Belgique, elle sera de la se-

conde. II en sera de meme des troisieme et quatrieme sections selon la latitude plus

ou moins septentrionale dans laquelle seront faites les observations, et c'est justement

ces rectifications qui feront, je I'espere, apprlcier I'utilit^ du travail que nous desirons

voir entrepris.

Description of ttvo Peruvian Mummies, presented to the Devon and Cornioall

  Natural History Society by Captain Blanckley, of the Royal Navy. By

   P. F. Bellamy, M.D.

They proved to be the remains of children of different ages, one a few months" old,

and the other not much more than one year ; they were brought from the mountain-

ous district of Peru, but at a considerable distance from the Lake Titicaca. In con-

junction with them were found certain envelopes (one of which proved to be an article

of dress, resembling a ponshad sewed up at the sides), and the model of a raft or ca-

tamaran, two small bags containing ears of an undescribed variety of Indian corn, and

two small earthen pots. He also exhibited a variety of other models, found wrapped

up with others examined by Capt. Blanckley. The skulls were found to resemble

those adult specimens contained in the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons in

--London, and presented the same peculiarities, viz. a short projecting face, square

protruding chin, receding forehead, and elongated cranium. He stated that he con-

--sidered their formation to be natural, for the following reasons : 1st, that the pecu-

liarities are as great in the child as in the adult, and indeed more remarkable in the

younger individual than in the elder                                                                                                                                   2nd, from the great relative length of the large
                                                                                                                                                                    ;

bones of the skull, all of which are elongated in a posterior direction ; 3rd, from the
position of the occipital bone, which occupies a place in the under part of the cranium

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

4th, from the absence of marks of pressure, there being no elevation of the vertex,

nor projection on either side ; and 5th, from there being no instrument, nor mechani-

cal contrivance, suited for the process of compression found in conjunction with the

remains. He called the attention of the Section to the pecuhar formation of the oc-

cipital bone, which he found to consist of five rudimentary portions, the fifth piece

being placed between the occipital portion, commonly so called, and the two parietal
bones. He considered the probabihty of the mummies being the remains of some

of the true Titicacan race, deposited after the arrival of the original emigrants, who

founded the Incas dynasty, and called on ethnologists to say what Asiatic people they

resembled in manners, customs, and attainments ; but if no affinity could be found,

he considered it fair to attribute to the indigenes a mental capacity equal to the

originating of such inventions as the specimens connected with these mummies

would indicate them to have been capable of. The extinction of the race he supposed

to have been gradual, and occasioned by an intermixture of blood with the followers

of Manco Cape. Lastly, he suggested that the adult skulls called Titicacans were

of two kinds, one being of the pure stock, the other of a spurious character, result-

ing from the union of the indigenes with the settlers of Asiatic origin, and presenting

a modified form ; there being added to the receding forehead and elongated cranium,

an elevated vertex and flattened occiput, formed principally by an altered position of

the occipital bone, which, instead of lying on a plane with the horizon, rises in a

sloping direction upwards and backwards.

         On the Varieties of the Human Race. By Dr. Caldwell.

   Considering that this subject had been too much neglected, the author proceeded to
give an example of the method by which he thought it ought to be treated, by a com-

parative view of the anatomical structure of the African and Caucasian varieties of
Man. After dwelling minutely on the anatomical structure of the two races, he stated
his conviction, that the former bore anatomically a nearer resemblance to the higher

Quadrumana than to the highest varieties of his own species.

Remarks on the Flora of Devon and Cornwall. By the Rev. W. S. Hore.

    Jones's ' Flora Devoniensis,' published about twelve years ago, has served as a
basis for the Flora of the two western counties of Devon and Cornwall, which, from
their position, form one of the districts into which Great Britain would naturally be
divided by the geographical botanist. The number of Phanerogamous species re-
--76 REPORT 1841.

corded by Jones is 774. Forty-one additional species are now enumerated for Devon,

and thirty-one for Cornwall, which would raise the number of plants indigenous to

the two counties to 846. The most interesting discoveries since the time of Jones,

axe Arthrolobium ebracteatum, Trichonema colunince, Viola Curtisii, Chrysocoma Lino-

syris, Trifoliiim Bocconi, and Hypericum linarifolium. Phycospermwm Cornubiense,

hitherto supposed to be Umited to the neighbourhood of Bodmin, is now mentioned

as growing near Tavistock in Devon. The old habitat of Scirpiis Noloschemis on

ABrampton Burrows has been destroyed by the shifting of the sand.  new spot, where

the plant is in some abundance, has, however, been exposed by the same cause. It

is not improbable that ere long it may become extinct.

    On some Species of European Pines. By Capt. Widdrington, R.N.

     In a paper on European Pines, read at Newcastle, the author did not allude to two
 species, as he had not seen them, viz. Pinus austriaca and P. Pumilio. Opportunities
 of observing them have since presented themselves. Pinus austriaca of English, P.

 nigrescens of the German botanists, partly covers the plain of Austria to the south and
 east of Vienna. It is also found in Austria on the borders of Styria, and clothes the
 hills near Baden. It does not appear to the north of this, and in considering its eleva-
 tion and geographj', it must be placed in the zone below Pinus sylvestris ; at the same

 time there can be no question that it would withstand the cold of these islands. It is
 very nearly connected with P. taiirica, or Pallasiana ; the foliage is scarcely to be di-
 stinguished. There is, however, a very perceptible difference in the form of the cones

 in cultivated species. From the quick growth of this tree, the great beauty of its fo-
 liage, thick and tangled, and of the deepest green, as well as the great value of the
 timber, which Austrian woodmen consider superior to that of P. sylvestris, Mr. Lawson
 of Edinburgh introduced this species. It may be planted in most places as a sub-
 stitute for the Pinaster, to which it is much superior, both in timber and appearance.
 Pinus Pumilio is a native, though sparingly, of Upper Styria ; it is most abundant in
 the Bavarian Alps. It inhabits marshy districts and the borders of lakes, as well as
 dry gravelly situations. The peculiar form of this tree consists in its having no regu-
 lar leader. It divides into a number of small stems and branches immediately above
 the ground. The height attained is rarely more than five or six feet, and the diameter
 of all the branches of the largest trees is not more than twenty or twenty-five feet. It

 grows so regularly, that, on looking over an extensive level planted with it, it is quite
 as even as the level of a gorse cover. The foliage, in form and colour, resembles that
 of P. uncinata, but the spicula are shorter. The cones are small and dark-coloured,
 and differ from those of P. sylvestris and P. uncinata. It is frequently confounded
 with stunted varieties of other pines. Its position in geographical range is by the side
 of P. Cembra and P. uncinata.

Notice of destruction of Plants hy Animal Odour. By Robert Ball, F. L.S.

     " Having obtained a very young porpoise (Delphinus phoccEna) a few hours after it was
 killed, I became anxious to get the immature bones of its skull without the trouble of dis-
 section, or the loss of time in maceration. Accordingly I placed the head in an earthen
 crock, and put upon it nearly a quart of large maggots (larvae of Musca vomitoria), in

.

 order that they might eat away the soft parts. I then placed the crock in a fern-house

 (that is to say, a miniature green-house) of about thirty cubic feet in dimension, with
 the view of devoting the maggots (when they were transformed into large blue flesh-
 flies) as food for some toads {Bufo vulgaris) and natterjacks {Bufo rubeta) which were
 confined in the fern-house. I then left them, and on returning six hours afterwards

 I was astonished at the change which had come on in the verdure of my plants. The

 flowering fern {Osmunda regalis) was turned red-brown; the maiden-hair {Adiantum Ca-
 pillus Feneris) was lying quite flaccid : several species oi Aapidium and other ferns were
 as if they had been plunged into boiling water, as was also a braSible (Rubus corylifo-
 lius), while a wood gourd (Oxalis acetosella) was turned yellow, and its leaflets dropped
 on the slightest touch ; in fact, no vegetable in the case escaped destruction of its leaves
 or fronds. The odour exhaled was not that of putridity, but of that peculiar heavy kind,
 so characteristic of the marine Mammalia : I do not pretend to speculate on the cause

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

 there did not appear to be any smell of ammonia."

On Natural History as a Branch of Education. By R. Patterson, F.L.S.

   After a lengthened series of arguments and illustrations, the following conclusions
were drawn :

   That the study of Natural History, independent altogether of any physical or
pecuniary advantages, is deserving of cultivation, because it is productive of benefi-
cial effects on both the perceptive and reflective faculties ; is accompanied by inno-
cent, yet elevated pleasures ; and exerts a powerful influence on the moral and de-
votional character. Hence it was urged that this study should form a regular part
of the course of education in both schools and colleges ; and that naturalists should
endeavour to place their favourite science in the same position in these kingdoms

which it now justly occupies on the continent.

Acomparative View of Animal and Vegetable Physiology. By Mr.BARThi^TT

  A comparison was drawn between plants and animals in the processes of digestion,

circulation, respiration. The necessity was dwelt on of never losing sight of organic
media, and the actions they produce, and of an invisible vital principle, which per-
vades not only every fibre in the muscular or cellular organism, but every atom of
each fluid. The fact of the existence of two great antagonizing principles, in the oi--
ganic and inorganic kingdoms, was pointed out, and their progressive development in
the history of the world was shown by means of a diagram. Descriptions were given
of the comparative circumstances under which the germs of animal and vegetable life
are first developed, the conditions of the embryos, &c. The nerves and sensorial
powers of animal tissues, and of their supposed analogies in vegetation, were described.
The influence of climate, light, &c. on the vegetable and animal kingdoms was con-
sidered, and a contrast drawn between the vegetation of the poles and the equator.

   Dr. Lankester exhibited a drawing of a monstrous rose, in which the pistil had
become a perfect branch. The drawing was by Mr. Denny of Leeds.

   Mr. Littleton of Saltash exhibited a common pear, in which a smaller pear had

grown from its apex.

Mr. Derrv exhibited some vegetable monstrosities.

   Dr. Daubeny exhibited to the Section a portable botanical press, which, by means
of a small windlass, was capable of producing a great amount of pressure.

   Mr. Prideaux exhibited specimens of copper from the bottom of a vessel which
had been acted on by sea-water, and was marked on its surface with small semi-

circular spots, which in many places penetrated through the copper. He wished to

know if zoologists were acquainted with any animal that would produce this effect.

Observations on a Pustular disease hithei-to ivndescribed by ivriters on Diseases

                    of the Skin. By Dr. A. T. Thomson.

   From its resemblance to the genus Porrujo, the disease was named by the author
Porriyo rodens. The eruption, unpreceded by any marked derangement of habit,

appears first upon the cheeks, in the form of a sm'all group of minute red papillae,

seated upon an inflamed spot ; similar groups may appear at the same time on the

neck or the upper part of the chest ; these soon become pustules, out of which oozes
a fluid, which dries into crusts that extend, assuming an irregular circular shape.
As the groups of pustules spread, the crusts of those first formed drop ofi", and leave
the cuticle marked with depressions similar to those produced by confluent small-pox.
After the continuance of the disease for some time, febrile disturbance shows itself.

and a chronic spreading inflammation of the surface ensues. Dr. Thomson considers
the exterior or reticular layer of the cutis to be the seat of the disease. The diagnosis,

requisite to distinguish it from other species of Porrigo, and other pustular diseases,

was minutely given, and a case detailed exhibiting the author's mode of treatment.
The principal remedies were bleeding and alteratives, particularly the iodides of arse-

nic and of mercury, in minute doses, with the liquor potasses and the iodide of po-
tassium in sarsaparilla decoction. The frequent use of the tepid bath, with milk and

farinaceous diet, were found useful until the termination of the disease, when more
generous food and tonics, particularly the syrup of the iodide of iron, and the solution
of the chloride of calcium in the decoction of sarsaparilla, were required. As topical
remedies, none were found useful but the tepid bath, and a strong solution of nitrate
of silver pencilled over the aifected parts. The description was illustrated by drawings
representing the disease in its aggravated form, and also in progress of decay from ap-

propriate treatment.

Abstract of a paper on the value of Opium as a remedy in Rheumatism, and

  on the circumstances which shoidd regxdate its employment. By Theo-

   PHiLus Thompson, M.D.

   One of the most remarkable instances of the successive over-valuation and unrea-
sonable disuse of a remedy is exhibited by the history of opium used for the cure of
rheumatism. Nearly forty years since. Dr. De la Roche, a London physician, was

accustomed to treat the disease with opium in doses of a grain and a half three times

a day ; at the same time promoting perspiration by warm clothing, and the use of beef
tea as diet. The practice, as recommended by De la Roche in the ' Edinburgh Medical

and Surgical Journal,' was to some extent imitated, but not generally adopted, and it

soon fell into disuse. Recently, however, the practice has been revived by some
of the American physicians, and Dr. Corrigan of Dublin has published accounts of
cases in which his principal dependence was on this remedy, and in some of which
the results were unusually happy. The object of the present communication is to

define the conditions in which this powerful remedy is likely to prove efficacious, so as

to prevent as far as possible future fluctuations of opinion respecting it, and to guard
against its unfortunate misuse or unjust discontinuance. The author of this paper has

adopted the opium plan in many cases with very gratifying results. In one instance

of severe rheumatic affection of the shoulders and knees, associated with valvular dis-

ease and enlargement of the heart and with gastric inflammation, after the relief of the
gastric symptoms, a grain of opium was administered every two hours. The pain was
speedily relieved, and after twenty pills had been taken entirely removed ; in seven
days from the commencement of the treatment the patient walked about the room

seeming well, and the peculiar barking which had attended the first sound of the

heart had become indistinct.

   An artist who had long been subject to severe rheumatism, and whose constitution

had been repeatedly shaken by prolonged treatment conducted on the usual plan,

Awas attacked with a violent rheumatic affection of the knees and arms.  single

small dose of colchicum wine produced great sickness and depression. He was

--immediately put on the opium treatment, and his own report five days afterwards

was as follows : " I have followed up the pills, and with this result, that I am free

from pain and much stronger, and I am sure this is an excellent way of subduing

the disease."

  A young medical practitioner, who had suffered for months from rheumatism of

the back and limbs, against which the whole artillery of anti-rheumatic remedies had
been directed, with no other effect than that of leaving him pallid, weak, desponding,

anxious, and with a threatened affection of the heart, willingly adopted the opium

treatment, in doses of a grain and a half every two hours. He took seventy pills in

four days, and in seven days was able to visit his patients.
   In most of the rheumatic cases in which full doses of opium have been given, the

skin has perspired profusely, the quantity of lithates in the urine has been consider-

able, and the bowels have not been constipated : the relief has been more prompt

and complete than that- experienced from the common modes of management, and
the strength has been rather improved than deteriorated under the treatment. On

                                                                                            k

the whole I feel justified in adopting the remark of the practical and accurate Heber-
den : " Praeterea meo judicio opium non tantummodo importuni mali praesidium est,

sed multum confert ad ipsum morbum tollendum."
   The following considerations may assist in determining the limits within which

these favourable results may be expected.
   The pains of rheumatism generally precede pyrexia, as well as the local redness

and swelling, and the fever is in the first instance rather neuralgic than inflammatory.
At the onset of such attacks, opium alone might be adequate to eifect a cure. In a
short time, however, the fever often assumes somewhat of an inflammatory charac-

ter, and we cannot judiciously dispense with bleeding. In this country there is also
for the most part another complication, namely, disordered digestive organs with

hepatic congestion, rendering the use of a small quantity of mercury expedient, and
in every instance it is important to promote perspiration by suitable clothing and

diet. In the neglect of such precautions, opium may aggravate the disease and fall
into discredit. When, however, they are observed, and the pulse is sufficiently re-
duced, the remedy, when freely administered, exhibits peculiar efiicacy, and removes

the pretext for renewed bleeding, which reaction might otherwise tempt the practi-

tioner to employ, at the risk of aggravating irritation, augmenting the susceptibility of

the pericardium to the action of the heart, increasing the tendency to metastasis,

and shaking the constitutional strength.

   The remedy under consideration appears peculiarly adapted to rheumatic patients

in whom the neuralgic element of the disorder is more marked than the dyspeptic

or inflammatory. Pain indeed, if not in most instances the most prominent symptom
at the commencement of the attack, usually becomes so after the removal of com-
plications by appropriate treatment, and the virtues of opium are signally manifest
in those cases in which a slightly soft and bounding character of pulse has been
produced by bleeding. The writer ofi"ers these recommendations with hope and yet
with diffidence, knowing how much time and care are necessary, especially in medi-
cine, to establish a single truth, and how great is the liability to error, even when we
seem to follow experience as our guide.

General Observations on the Pathology and Cure of Squinting. By John

  Butter, M.D., F.R.S., F.L.S., S^c, Physician to the Plymouth Royal
  Eye Infirmary.

   The author in this paper pointed out the difi'erent kinds of squinting, their causes,

and treatment. He thought that the term " Congenital " was often misapplied to

squinting, which he considered to arise generally some time after birth, owing to a

contraction of the muscle or tendon produced by some internal disease, as fits, worms,

measles, small-pox, hydrocephalus. The real nature of squint he ascribed to an

hypertrophy or too great strength of one muscle, or to an atrophy or weakness of

the antagonist ; and drew an analogy between this and other muscular affections,

as hemiplegia, St. Vitus's dance, locked-jaw, and the like.

Remedies have been devised in all ages in vain by philosophers, poets, physicians,

and mechanics. Some proposed mirrors, reading small print, masks, spectacles,

goggles, gnomons, plaisters, funnels, a candle behind the back, bandaging one eye,

and even internal medicines. SuflSce it to say that there was no remedy known to

the close of the year 1839.

AThe year 1840 shed a new light on this subject.  cure now is almost certain

from an operation. Dr. Stromeyer of Hanover, and Dr. Dieffenbach of Berlin led

the way. Their examples were soon followed by Mr. Bennett Lucas of London,

and also by Dr. Franz, Mr. Guthrie, and others.

   The author considered that during the last year (1840) some thousands of squinters

were cured perfectly in the United Kingdom, and many hundreds in the three towns of

Plymouth, Stonehouse, and Devonport, of whom a great number had been operated
on at the Plymouth Royal Eye Infirmary. He considered the operation simple,

safe and successful in skilful hands, and had never known an untoward result or loss of
vision from it in his own practice, which appeared, from the living instances of pa-

tients cured and shown at the meeting, to have been considerable.

Dr. Butter haa discarded the tribe of instruments recommended by others, and

performs the operation with only two, one held in each hand, viz. forceps with bjunt
hook appended, and scissors *.

   He gave full credit to the Germans for their inventions, and spoke highly of their
medical and surgical attainments. He also briefly alluded to Mr. Tyrrell's most

excellent work on the Eye, and considered it very unfortunate for the author that this
discovery should have been coeval with his book, which brings our knowledge of oph-
thalmic diseases well up to the present period, but does " not recommend surgical in-

terference in such cases " as squinting. The only wonder is, why this simple ope-

ration, which requires about one minute in performing, should not have been sooner

discovered. On the whole, the author considered it to be the most satisfactory and

successful of all operations which he ever performed or witnessed.

 Facts as yet unnoticed in the Treating of Squinting. By J. V. Solomon.

   The author related certain facts on this subject which had come within his obser-

vations.

Obsei'vations on tico new Fascia connected with theMuscles of the HmnanEye.

                             By P. Bennett Lucas.

    In a treatise on the cure of strabismus by operation, published a year and a half
ago by the author of this communication, a description of these fascise was given.
Mr. Beimett Lucas's present object is to place on the records of the British Associa-

tion the existence of these new structures ; and to inquire into their physiological uses
and vital properties,--" points," as the author remarked, " of great moment, as bear-
ing on the actions of a group of muscles which has at all times been looked upon
with the liveliest interest by the physiologist, and which now possesses additional
importance on account of the new operation for the cure of strabismus." From the
positions which these fascise hold to the conjunctiva and the muscles of the eye, the
author designated them by the names of " suh-conjunctival" and " sub-muscidar " ;
and having demonstrated their existence by preparations of the human eye, to the

satisfaction of the Medical Section, he next proceeded to explain their uses, and to in-

quire into their practical bearings on the cure of strabismus by operation. On the

first of these points Mr. Bennett Lucas observed, that the sub-conjunctival fascia, like

the sub-cutaneous fasciae of the neck, the groin, and other region^, presented many
degrees of density in the different subjects in which it was examined. That it was
present in all subjects and at all ages, but that in the young subject it was very de-
licate. That it was composed of condensed cellular tissue, and possessed elasticity
and that its use was to keep in an expanded condition, and to support the long and

delicate muscles destined for producing the motions of the eye-ball ; without which
provision the eye-ball would he abrupth' pulled about in its orbit, and that steady,
uniform, delicate and perfect movement which it enjoys would be impossible.
Amongst the instances of other delicate muscles being similarly disposed as to
fasciae, the author mentioned the omo-hyoid, the sterno- and thyro-hyoid, the sarto-
rius, &c. In operating for the cure of strabismus, when the sections of the tunica
conjunctiva and the sub-conjunctival fascia are made, the author remarked, that one
might be confounded with the other, on account of both retracting to the same ex-
tent on being divided, and presenting almost identical appearances ; but that, in or-
der to distinguish one from the other, the test of their different degrees of sensibility
sufficed, the conjunctiva being exquisitely sensible when grasped in a pair of forceps,

--and the sub-conjunctival fascia being perfectly insensible when thus treated, points

of practical importance, as it is injurious to remove any portion of the tunica con-
junctiva in the operation for strabismus, whilst it is often necessary to remove por-

tions of the sub-conjunctival fascia.

   The sub-muscular fascia was demonstrated as highly elastic, and attached to the
neurilema of the optic nerve behind, and to the sclerotica, at the points of insertion
of the recti muscles, in front ; and that it also was in intimate connexion with the
muscles of the eye, at the very situations where the section of them was made in

operating for the cure of strabismus.

Some Observations on a Case of Deafness, Dumbness, and Blindness, with

              Remarks on the Muscular Sense. By Dr. Fowler.

   The case was that of a young woman in the Rotheihithe Workhouse ; she was
born deaf and dumb, and was blinded by small -pox when three years old. She is
now about twenty, and does not hear the loudest efforts of the voice, but starts on a
poker held by a string against her ear being struck against a grate, or when her

nurse stamps' on the boarded floor. Touch was the only sense which others used
for communicating with her, or she employed in examining persons or objects. She
possessed both taste and smell, but did not appear to have used them. Until the age
of fourteen or fifteen her existence appeared merely animal, but then a marked differ-
ence took place in her habits ; she became as attentive to dress and personal deco-
rum as any other girl. She feels her way without a guide to every part of the work-
house, recognizes all its inmates by the feel of their hands, makes her bed, and sews,
not only plain work, but even the more intricate parts of dress. She is very tena-
cious of what she deems her own, and was much pleased with a shilling which was
put into her hands, smiling, curtseying, and feeling it eagerly for some time after-
wards. The author deems the true key to so much and minute information derived
from touch alone to be the development of the muscular sense, and of the reciprocal
influence of the adjustments of the different organs of sense on each other, by which

all the exquisite attainments of the artisan, the musician, the sculptor, the painter,
and even the orator are regulated. Several instances were given of the existence of

this sense in the lower animals, and practical suggestions made for its application in
educating the deaf and dumb, particularly when these defects are complicated with

blindness.

Abstracts of an extraordinary case of Albuminous Ascites, ivith Hydatids ; of

  Jive cases of Hqyatic Abscess, and of two cases of Phthisis. By Sir D. J.

   H. Dickson, M.D., F.R.S.E., F.L.S., Inspector of Hospitals, and of tlw

African Institute of Paris.

J. Prendergast, set. 46, who had been invalided from this hospital two years pre-

viously, and subsequently in Haslarwith ascites, was re- admitted, greatly emaciated,

and with the abdomen enormously enlarged, on the 11th of September last. The

dyspnoea and oppression were so great, that, though with little hope of benefit, it was

deemed advisable to attempt to relieve him by tapping, on the 17th, but about a pint

only of a yellow, gelatinous looking fluid, slowly escaped through the round canula,

and he died on the 27th of September, 1841. Sectio Cadaveris, thirty-one hours

post mortem. The abdomen was much distended by a clear semi-concrete matter,

nearly resembling half-liquefied calves-foot jelly, while a thinner eftusion occupied the

interstices between the intestines and viscera, which had been inseparably accreted

Aby pre-existing inflammation of the peritoneal coat.   great quantity cf this matter

covered the peritoneum, and adhering to its processes, was detached in filmy vesicular

masses, and also nearly filled the cavity of the pelvis. Other globular bodies, more

distinctly invested  by  a  fine,  pellucid  membrane,  accurately  resembled hydatids
                                                                                                                                                             ;

some of them being smaller, were appended to larger ones, which were attached by

pedicles to the peritoneal surface of different organs, or in firmer cysts were imbedded

in their structure, especially in the spleen : these vesicular cysts were of various

sizes, from a small grape or nut to that of an orange, but they decreased in di-

stinctness of organization as they increased in size. The more fluid portion of this

jelly-like effusion, coagulated by heat, and on being tested by the nitric acid and acetic

acids and tincture of galls, &c., was found to consist chiefly of albumen with a smaller

proportion of gelatin.

Sir David Dickscm subsequently communicated abstracts of five cases of hepatic

abscess, the contents of two of which made their way through the diaphragm and

were discharged by expectoration ; one, by opening it externally, and another into

the cavity of the abdomen. These cases were accompanied by some remarks on the

infrequency of serious organic diseases of the liver, which, though at variance witli

the very generally received opinion, are corroborated by extensive necroscopic in-

vestigations during seventeen years at Plymouth Hospital.

In a concluding paper he adduced two cases of phthisis, one of which terminated

ease to almost every important organ of the body.

Association, by Sir D. Dickson, abstracts of which were not transmitted in time to
be inserted in the last volume of Transactions, viz.

--a clasp-knife during gyration ; of marked and rapid pericarditis and pleuritis : and

   The case was successfully treated by the operation of paracentesis thoracis. But
as the secretion of pus still continued it became necessary to repeat the operation,
and finally to keep a silver canula in the opening, to procure an easy discharge.

              Case of Empyema. By William Joseph Square.

  --E. C, sempstress, set. 27 years. The peculiar features of interest in this case were

the development of empyema, with copious expectoration of pink foetid pus, the
formation of external abscess, discharge of the pus contained within the cavity of
the pleura, immediate cessation of the peculiar expectoration, and the eventual re-
covery of the patient. The physical signs of the disease before the evacuation of
the matter were the ordinary ones of empyema, conjoined with gargouillement,
pectoriloquy, and cavernous respiration under the clavicle of the disetised side
these, the physical signs of a cavity, ceased after the evacuation of the pus, and im-
mediately on such evacuation, metallic tinkling was developed.

   The therapeutic operations of nature were principally relied on, in conducting the

case to a favourable termination.

                                              COMBE, F.S.A.

  Though some Roman and British coins have been found in the vicinity, there are
no traces of the existence of any Roman settlement, or of any town, here or in the
immediate neighbourhood, in the Anglo-Saxon times ; in Domesday Book, Sutton,
the ancient name of the township, appears to have been tenanted only by serfs and
fishermen. In the reign of Henry I. a part of Sutton was granted to the Valletort
family, and bore their name, in order to distinguish it from Sutton Prior, which was
granted to the monks of Plympton. It soon became known as a naval port, for a
fleet of 325 vessels assembled in its waters in the reign of Edward I. under the com-
mand of Edmund Earl of Lancaster. In the 26th of Edward I. deputies were sent
from the town to Parliament. The name of the place was changed to Plymouth
about the reign of Edward III. In 1346 it sent a quota of 26 ships and 613 men
to the blockade of Calais, but having been subsequently burned by the French, it was
so reduced, that in 1414 it did not send representatives to Parliament, though mem-

bers were returned by Totness, Plympton, Exeter, and Dartmouth. The population
of Plymouth, in the last year of Edward III., is stated at 7000 in the record of the
poll-tax levied by that sovereign. In 1439 the borough was incorporated by Henry
VI., and has ever since ranked as a corporate town. The corporation early paid at-

tention to the instruction of youth, for there is a record, in 1501, of their having en-

gaged a master at a salary of 10/. per annum, to teach grammar to the children of

the town. In the reign of Elizabeth, the fleet destined to oppose the Armada was
assembled in the port of Plymouth. Some of the most distinguished captains were

natives of the town or its neighbourhood. Under the auspices of Sir F. Drake, but

Mewat the expense of the corporation, the river  was brought twenty-five miles

from Dartmoor, and from this source the town still continues to receive an abundant

supply of fresh water. The increasing prosperity of the town was proved by the forma-

tion of the Plymouth Company for colonizing North America, in union with the Lon-

don Company. It was under their auspices that New Plymouth, U.S., was founded.

In 1577 the merchants of Plymouth engaged in the slave trade, as records still exist

of their having in that year chartered several vessels to Guinea. The great civil

war was injurious to its prosperity ; the people of Plymouth embraced the popular

side, while the gentry of the neighbourhood were decided royalists. To punish the

townsmen, and to check their republican propensities, Charles II. erected a citadel.

Some of the regicides were imprisoned on St. Nicholas Island, where, according to

tradition, they were treated with great severity. In the reign of William III. the

naval advantages of Plymouth, which had been noticed by Sir Walter Raleigh a cen-

Atury before, were first appreciated by the government.  dockyard, victualling

oflSce, gun wharf, and hospital, were erected, which laid the foundation of the pre-

sent town of Devonport. In the same year, 1 696, the first lighthouse was constructed

on the Eddystone. Mr. Woollcombe then detailed the history of the several light-

houses built upon this rock. In 1812 the Breakwater was commenced, but Mr.

Woollcombe stated that fears were entertained that this structure would eventually

injure the anchorage ground. The population of Plymouth had increased from

20,000 in 1812, to 31,000 in 1831, and to 36,000 according to the present census.

The houses are better built than formerly, the appearances of domestic comfort more

striking, and the literary and charitable institutions greatly multiplied. The returns

of the Custom-house for the last official year amounted to 135,930Z. 15s. Id. Stone-

house has risen from a population of 3667, in 1801, to nearly 10,000 at the present

time ; while Devonport, which could scarcely be said to exist at the beginning of the

century, now contains 34,000 souls. The chief wants of Plymouth and Devonport were

church accommodation for the poor, and education. The author's returns on both

subjects were incomplete, but it appeared that there are five churches in Plymouth,

two in Stonehouse, and four in Devonport. There are eighteen dissenting chapels and

one Jewish synagogue in Plymouth, but the numbers for Stonehouse and Devonport

had not been ascertained. There is only one Roman Catholic place of worship in

the district, the chapel at Stonehouse. The education returns were confined to the

higher classes of schools, and, therefore, are no t^st of the intellectual condition of

the community. Mr. Woollcombe added a rough estimate of the government expen-

diture, from which it appeared that 2300/. are paid every Friday night in wages to

the naval operatives. He had not procured the Ordnance returns.

   On the Agricultural Products of Cornwall. By Sir C. Lemon, Bart.

   This paper had been commenced some years ago, but on account of unexpected
difficulties it was laid aside for a time ; but reflecting that many statistical records
which have little value at the present day may in a future age possess importance,
the author resumed his labours. Cornwall being nearly surrounded by sea, he
hoped to have been able, for a series of years, to compare the progress of population
with the imports of grain and corn, but he found that the books at the Custom-house
in Falmouth had been destroyed, by order of the Government, fourteen years ago,
and nothing preserved but a few extracts, which were of no value in the present in-
quiry. From the various records and itineraries of Cornwall it appeared, that down

to the date of Eraser's Agricultural Report in 1794, the agriculture of the county

was neither deficient nor redundant, but nearly sustained the population. He read
extracts from Leland's journey in the reign of Henry VIH. ; from Carew, who states

                                                       2{;

that ill abumlant seasons the county produced a surplus of corn for exportation

from Camden and Norden, who mention that corn is produced in competent abun-
dance. Blome, who wrote in the reign of Charles 11., states that the county was

more inclined to sterility than fertilit)', but that the manuring of the ground with

sand enabled the industrious to raise good corn. Borlase, who wrote in 1756, as-

serts that agriculture had not increased in proportion to the population, and that the

county was beginning to import corn. Fraser, who wrote in 1794, complains that

agriculture was neglected, and that, if more attention were paid to it, the county

would support more than its existing population. Mr. Morgan, in 1808, describes

agriculture as having greatly improved since Fraser's time. The number of inhabit-

ants in successive ages can scarcely be obtained. Lysons refers to a poll-tax in
the reign of Edward III. (1377), and thence calculates the population of the county

at 34,960 persons. The number in 1700 is stated by Marshall at 105,800. From
Finlaison's returns Sir C. Lemon calculated, that in 1760 the number was 137,000.
By the census of 1801 the population was 188,269. And from these data was framed

a table of the population which probably was fed by the agriculture of the county,

Such appears to have been the progress of agriculture during the 200 years previous

to Fraser's report. The present population is about 345,000, dependent on agricul-

ture, fisheries, and corn imported by the coasting trade for subsistence. From the

returns collected it appears that there is an annual deficiency of grain equal in effect

to 52,786 quarters of wheat. Against this is to be set an export of 11,690 cwt. of

potatoes, valued at 58451., and equivalent to 2050 quarters of wheat at 57s. per

quarter. No accurate information could be obtained respecting the cattle which cross

the borders to and from Devonshire, but from a comparison of various accounts, the

following maybe taken as an approximation to their amount and value :

Exported.-- Lean cattle, 3500, at 10/. per head                                                                                                         £35,000

                                                                                                                                                             10,800

                                                                                                                                                        £42,200

This balance also should be carried to the credit of the agriculture of the county,

and is equal in value to 14,807 quarters of wheat at 57s.

ITie supplies to the shipping may  be  worth  5000 quarters more                                                                                        the whole together
                                                                                                                                                     ;

making a set off of 21,857 quarters of wheat to be deducted from the deficiency stated

above, and leaving finally a deficiency of agricultural produce necessary for the con-
sumption of the county, equal to 30,929 quarters of wheat. The value of this quantity
in money is about 88,147/. ; and this sum must be annually expended out of the other

exports of the county to the parties supplying it with corn. These exports may be

estimated as follows :                                        £862,527

making in round numbers about 1,300,000^. annually, and showing that about -l-^th
of the annual exports covers the deficiency of agricultural produce. The consumption

of cattle and sheep in the county, estimated from the hides supplied to the tan-yards, is.

Computing the carcase of each bullock at 6 cwt. each, each calf at 1 cwt., and each

sheep at ^ cwt., the gross amount will be 135,500 cwt., equal to about 45 lbs. for each

person of a population of 336,000 souls. This is exclusive of pig-meat, the con-

sumption of which cannot be ascertained, but is certainly great. It is estimated that

there are in Cornwall,

         Of cultivated land                          550,000 acres.

         Of improvable land                          190,000 ...

To ascertain the qualities of the soil. Sir C. Lemon had specimens analysed of the

natural soil taken from the three principal geological formations, viz. the slate, the

serpentine, and the granite. This analysis gave very unexpected results. There was

an extraordinary similarity between the ingredients and the proportions in all these

specimens, and what was still more surprising, a total absence of some of the cha-

racteristics of the rocks beneath. The feldspar in granite contains about 17 per cent.

of potash, but there is no potash in the soil above. The serpentine contains from 30

to 40 per cent, of magnesia, but there is no magnesia in the soil of Goonhely Downs.

Yet these are indestructible substances, and if the soil had been formed by the de-

composition of the rocks beneath, a considerable quantity of each must have been

present. As these soils are deposited on high grounds, in the case of Goonhely

Downs extending over a very large and elevated plateau, Sir Charles concluded by

proposing, as a geological problem, " Whence did they come ? How formed ? or how

transported ?"

                                                 upon-HuU.

   In the year 1839, the Manchester Statistical Society sent their agent to examine
into the condition of the working classes in the town of Hull, and the following are

among the more important results elicited by the inquiry :
   Hull affords less employment to women and children, and more variable employ-

ment to men, than the manufacturing districts. It also contains a far smaller pro-

portion of immigrants   from Wales,    Ireland, and  Scotland                                           and a  superior state of
                                                                                                     ;

education, and certain advantages of physical condition, are distinguishing traits of this

district. Out of 8757 dwellings, only fifteen were cellars, containing forty-four in-

habitants, that is, 14- per cent, of the whole population, or 1^ per cent, of the work-

ing classes ; while in Manchester and Salford, ten per cent., and in Liverpool twenty
per cent, live in cellars. The separation of families is also more distinct, and the sy -

stem of taking lodgers less prevalent ; the average of individuals to each separate oc-

cupation being 43 in Hull, against b\ in Pendleton, near Manchester, where a similar

inquiry was instituted. The centesimal proportions of the population of Hull, divided

according to nativity, are,

Out of 9832 males, only 709 were unemployed ; but out of 11,400 females, only 2606

carried on an ostensible trade apart from household occupations. In the remaining

8794 females are not included domestic servants, or those having a definite calling

within-doors. It is worthy of remark, that this number of unemployed females coin-
cides almost exactly with that of the heads of families ; and hence it may fairly be
concluded that in ordinary times there are but few cases in which the labour of adult

males is not sullicientto maintain the family intolerable comfort. The rental of cot-

tages in Hull appears to be very moderate, the average being somewhat under two

shillings a week for houses, one shilling and five pence for chambers, and one shilling

and two pence for cellars ; an average applicable to rather more than half the resi-

dences of the working classes. The state of drainage and the supply of water to the

cured, Hull may be considered as favourably circumstanced in both respects.

districts ; the rents are lower, the streets cleaner, the houses better ventilated, and

less frequently situated in courts.

      On the Economic Statistics of Sheffield. By a Committee.

   Sheffield is known abroad chiefly by its cutlery ; but it is not less celebrated at

home for its silver and plated productions. Those engaged in the latter species of
work have not been subject to the same vicissitudes as the cutlers, but have been con-
stantly in full work, and receiving high wages. The following table shows the value
of British-made plate for a series of years. It must be borne in mind that the goods

are generally of an inferior quality :

1829            £177,830                        1833            £179,283
1830              190,515                       1834              192,269
1831              188,144                       1835              231,903

1832            173,593

   The annual consumption of these goods in England is estimated at 1,200,000L
The earnings of the men vary, in proportion to their skill, from 18s. to 42s. per week,
and some receive much more. The unions among the workmen are rich, and should
any master resist their dictation, they can afford a handsome allowance weekly; but

the restrictions imposed by these unions are not so severe as in other trades, partly

on account of the variety of work, and partly on account of the superior intelligence
of the workmen. The number of operatives is a little over 400. They have sick

societies, separate from the unions, which afford efficient relief to those who have

been incapable of working 'for three successive months.

   The saw-manufacture is next in importance. The workmen are remarkable for
sobriety, intelligence, and good conduct. They have unions, which regulate wages,

the number of apprentices, and afford relief in sickness. There are 208 journeymen,

about twenty of whom are not in union ; the number of boys is 130, which exceeds

what is allowed by the rules of the trade. The wages vary according to work and

skill, but may be stated at from 24s. to 32s. per week. Piece-work is still more un-
certain, ranging from 28s. to 45s. Wages are about the same now as in 1814, but

work has been increased 25 per cent. The trade depends on foreign orders, and is

subject to great fluctuations. The edge-tool manufactory employs about 200 foremen,

200 strikers, and 50 apprentices. The average of the wages, supposing a man to work

eleven hours per day, is, foreman 34s., and strikers 22s. : they all work by the piece.

The labour is severe, and produces exhaustion, which leads to vicious excesses and
intoxication. The spring-knife manufacturers are among the worst paid in the town,
and suffer more than any others in seasons of commercial distress. Their numbers

are                                                      1400

   In the first manufactories of the town, the average of wages is from l6s. to 25s.

per week; but in many inferior manufactories they receive only from 12*. to l6s.
The tools required by these men are few and simple ; and hence, in periods of dis-

tress, they manufacture for themselves, and sell the goods to hardware dealers, &c.,
which produces still greater depression in the trade. These operatives marry early,

and have generally large families.

  The file-trade employs 1420 men, 700 boys, and 100 women : the wages vary con-
siderably, as the work is paid by the piece ; but the following is the average :--

The filers are inferior to the platers, but are superior to the grinders, &c. The num-
ber of clubs among the operatives in Sheffield is 56. The numbers in 1839 only amount

to 7978 ; and the whole stock, belonging to 38 clubs, is 53,373Z. There are no ac-
counts of the numbers in 17 clubs, and of the funds in 18. The number of secret

orders is 36, containing 2940 members.

On the Vital Statistics of Sheffield, prepared by a local Committee, and for-
                        warded to the Section by Dr. Holland.

It began by describing the position of the town, showing how favourably it was

circumstanced in respect to ventilation, drainage, and supply of water. It had ad-

vanced very rapidly                                                                   both in                    population and wealth                                                                                                                              but though no data existed for
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

determining the latter, it was believed that wealth had advanced in the greater ratio.

Sheffield did not possess many large capitalists ; the nature of the trades followed in

Athe town did not require any expensive outlay in stock and machinery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         remark-

able proof of its advancement was, that in the middle of the last century there was only

one commercial traveller employed in the town ; there is now scarcely an establish-

ment that does not employ one or more. The following table shows the increase of

population :--

In 1736                                                                                                          16,000.

                                                                                                                 91.000                 34 per cent.

The value of property in Sheffield had been greatly diminished by the cessation of

foreign demand                                                                        and this had principally affected the cutlers, who depend on the ex-
                                                                                   ;

port trade, but had not seriously injured the silversmiths and platers, who look to

the home market. In no place perhaps have the poor-rates exhibited such extraor-

dinary variations. In 1801 they were 7200L ; but in 1820 they rose to 23,000?.,
out of a rental which, it is supposed, did not exceed 46,000?. In 1825 they were re-
duced to 6000Z. ; in 1836, to 5000?. ; and in 1837, to 4000?. The present amount
is 6500?. ; and the distress at the present moment is believed to be greater than it
has ever been before. Trades in which combinations and associations exist, are
found to become claimants on charity less frequently than those which are uncom-

bined. This is attributed by the author of the Report to the habits of foresight and

prudence which arise from trade societies for a common object. One branch of trade,

within the last four years, paid to unemployed workmen in the same line not less
than 2000?. The author of the Report then entered into a comparison of the con-

dition of the operatives in Sheffield with those of Liverpool, Leeds, and Manchester,

for the purpose of showing that enormous capitals are not favourable to the happi-

ness of the general                                                                   body                       and that the greatest  misery must be                                                                                                              expected                   in the vi-

cinity of the greatest wealth. He dwelt particularly on the fact, that the operatives

of Sheffield usually have a house to themselves ; and that there is nothing in that

town similar to the cellars of Liverpool, or the lodgings of Manchester. The danger

to life involved in the manufactures at Sheffield, was illustrated by a comparison of
the numbers who die beyond the age of 70 in that town and in other districts.

   Out of every 1000 deaths the average above 70 is 145 for England and Wales.
   210 for the Northern and Western Ridings of Yorkshire.

104 for London.

66 for Sheffield.

63 for Liverpool and Manchester.

                           270 for the mining districts of Staffordshire.

               180 in the agricultural counties.

               242 in Sheffield.

In comparing the mortalities of different trades, the two classes of occupation most

unfavourable to human life, are found to be those which require frequent transitions
from heat to cold, and which generate metallic dust. In what is called " dry grind-
ing," the mortality is said to be " truly appalling ;" but the rate was not stated, save
that a " dry grinder " is considered an old man at 35. Early marriages in Sheffield

are more common among the underpaid than among the higher classes of workmen
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

and the ratio of children to a marriage is also higher in the more distressed class.

But Sheffield exhibits a less ratio of marriage than most other manufacturing towns.

In Sheffield (1839-40) the proportion of marriages to a thousand inhabitants was 9i,
while in Leeds it was 17. The writer of the Report then entered at great length into
the question of Savings Banks, for the purpose of showing that the amount of

deposits affords no trustworthy criterion of the prosperity or adversity of a commu-
nity. He stated that adversity, by forcing prudential considerations on the mind,
was more likely to make men become depositors than prosperity. As an example,

he stated, that during the last three years trade had notoriously declined in Sheffield,
and had gone on in a falling ratio, yet the amount in the savings banks had been on

the increase.

In 1838 there were 4093 depositors to the amount of £142,000

   The proportion of artisans among the depositors appears to be very small ; and it

is least among those to whom a provision is most necessary. Out of 5000 cutlers

there were only 221 depositors ; while out of 450 silversmiths and platers, there are
89. The greatest number of depositors is found in the present year, which is the year

of greatest depression.

   Mr. Fripp read a paper on the Statistics of Education in the city of Bristol, which
was intended to complete and perfect the Report he had made on the subject at the
meeting of the Association in 1836. The present population of the city of Bristol is

about 120,000, and this number is assumed as the basis for the proportions between
the instructed and the uninstructed. The schools which formed the subject of in-

quiry are divided into six classes.      14 with 1,705 scholars, IT 60 per cent.

schools, and are therefore not reckoned. It appears that of the total number of chil-

dren receiving instruction,
10,181, or about 8^ per cent, of the population, attend day and evening schools.

 4,513, or about 3f per cent., attend both day and Sunday schools.
 7,171, or about 6 per cent., attend Sunday schools only.

   Of the total number of children in day and evening schools,

 7,825, or 53} per cent., are boys.

 In the Sunday schools there are

Accou7it of the Monts de Pietd of Rome, Paris, and other cities on the Con-

      tinent. By Henry John Porter, F.S.S., Tandragee, Ireland.

  The author stated that an institution of the kind had been formed at Rome before

the Christian era by the Emperor Augustus, but that they were revived in modern Italy
under the patronage of the Popes. The system was supported by tlie Franciscans,
and opposed by the Dominicans, until the matter was set at rest by Leo X., wlio de-
clared lending-houses to be legal and useful, a decree subsequently confirmed by the
Council of Trent. From an old Italian work, entitled ' The Pious Institutions of Rome,'
])ublished in 1689, he gave the following account of the origin of the Monte di Pieta.
The work was so rare that he could not purchase a copy, but had been permitted to
make an extract.

   "The original founder of this great work of benevolence in Rome, was Padre Gio-
vanni Calvo, a Franciscan of the order of Minorites, who obtained tlio sanction of
Paul III. for an association of some persons of distinction, whom he had united for
this object. This pontiff not only approved the institution of the present sacred Monte

di Pieta, but assisted the undertaking with money, enriched it with indulgences and
privileges, and conferred on it all the favours enjoyed by similar institutions. The
sacred Monte di Pieta has for its object the advance of sums of money, in each case

not exceeding thirty crowns, to poor and necessitous persons of every description, on

the security of pledges. This is accomplished as individuals, actuated by benevolent

motives, supply funds to the institution, or, apprehensive of danger if they retain

money at home, deposit it with the establishment for greater security. The pledges

which are taken from day to day are retained eighteen months, after which, if the
owner fails to claim them, they are sold publicly and fairly, by auction. The proceeds
are applied to satisfying the claims of the establishment, including interest at two per
cent., and the surplus is returned to the owner of the pledge. The institution is go-
verned by a fraternity, which every year elects forty of its members as directors.
The directors meet weekly, to deliberate on all that is required for the maintenance

of the establishment, which may be regarded as the common patrimony of the poor,
and the great mansion of all." The document then set forth the favours which had

been shown to the institution by successive popes, ending with the promulgation of
its statutes by Alexander VII. Mr. Porter stated, that as he was anxious to obtain
some information respecting the founder of this institution, he applied to the GeneraL
 of the Franciscan order, and obtained from his secretary the following extract from

--the records of the Franciscan monastery at the Arracoeli in Rome: "1541. John

 Calvus, son of Calvus, was a native of the kingdom of Corsica, and educated in the

province of Corsica. He was a man renowned for his learning, skill, and suavity of
manners. He held the office of Commissario in the court of Rome ; he was selected
at the general assembly at Mantua, to regulate the whole order of Franciscans. He
was the first person lo institute the Monte di Pieta. He was eminent for a two-fold

apostolic office ; he was theological advocate at the Council of Trent ; he was esteemed

by Paul III., and the kings of France and Lusitania. He died at Trent 21st of

January 1547, having held office about six years." The following table shows the
state of the Monte di Pieta in Rome, for the year 1839 :

is gratifying to find that the sum of 44,8 Hi. has been deposited by farmers, as the

money-lenders just described were persons holding from twenty to fifty acres of

land ; the greater part of this sum was therefore formerly employed in usurious
practices, to which the farmers now prefer the certainty of 5 or 6 per cent., without

any trouble or risk. The sum deposited by manufacturers is trifling, being little

more than one- seventh of the agricultural amount. It appears that 329 servants

have deposited 7157^. ; these depositors are not numerous, except in those loan so-

cieties where small sums are received at a lesser interest, until they amount to rtl.,

when a debenture may be purchased and the interest increased to 6 per cent. De-

positors of 50/. are the most numerous class ; Mr. Porter thinks them desirable only
at the commeneement of such an institution, and wishes them to be gradually paid

oflF, in order to make room for the depositors of smaller sums. The greatest number

of loans have been applied, it is believed, to the most useful purposes. In the year

1840 there were issued                                        Lt oans. Aamount.^

For the purchase of provisions the number of loans has been 23,363, amounting

to 77,5 lOZ.  Loans for the payment of rent and debts are not generally encouraged
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

nevertheless, there are many instances of the best effects from both of these objects.

For the purpose of dealing in various ways, the sum of 53,938/. has been issued, in

14,295 loans. This class of borrowers is very numerous.

The following is a return of the loan funds whose directors have expressed their

conviction of the benefits conferred by these institutions in various ways, viz.

91 state that there were little or no evils apparent.

   The agricultural loan funds at Tyrrell's Pass and Moate are the most extensive,
and a knowledge of their judicious management may lead others to follow their ex-

ample. The first extends its operations over four hundred square miles ; it has em-

ployed a Scotch agriculturist, and furnishes seeds to farmers. It also supports from

its profits an infant school, in which 120 children are educated ; a platting school

for Irish Leghorn hats and bonnets has been commenced, and the manufacture of those

Aarticles from grass and rye-straw is of acknowledged beauty.    Ladies' Society is

connected with the loan fund, which distributed at Christmas last 202/. worth

of clothing, and 177 stones of wool were lent on three months' credit, and above

A40/. given in premiums. The report of the agriculturists is most satisfactory.

forded to 5229, who, with their families, constituted an aggregate of 19,795 souls,

all deriving benefit from the employment aflbrded to one or more members of their
families. The Moate Loan Fund has allocated 50/. per annum to an agricultural

school. It is the only one in Leinster, and if properly supported by the landed pro-

prietors, will doubtless prove a great benefit to the farming population. The sum

of 80/. has been given as premiums to the farmers in those parishes from which the

loan fund derives its profits. Forty pounds were also given to the Ladies' Chari-

On the branch of the system which embraces Monts de Piet^, Mr. Porter referred to
his paper read at Glasgow. He however stated that they are increasing in number,
and are doing much to mitigate the evils of pawnbroking. At Limerick, Tandragee,

Portadown, Belfast, Cork, Newcastle, and Dungannon, Monts de Piet^ are in active
operation, and Coleraine and several other towns are in correspondence on the sub-
ject, with the view of opening such institutions. Mr. Porter then presented the fol-
lowing tables, explaining that the total number of loan funds was 215, of which three
were closed, 73 had not yet made returns, and 66 kept no account of the subjects

recorded in the second table.

zation, and that he is between sixteen and twenty years of age ; soldiers only are per-

mitted to enjoy a special exemption from this last rule, and they may be admitted

to the competition, provided they have not attained their twenty-fifth year.
   The subjects of the entrance examination include arithmetic, algebra, plane and

descriptive geometry, plane and spherical trigonometry, logarithms, conic sections,

and statics ; exercises are also given in drawing from a model of the human figure,

and in architectural coloured drawing ; and the candidates are further expected to trans-

late a passage from a Latin author, to write a French essay on a given subject, to
work a trigonometrical question, and to compose a mathematical paper on some given
problem, or on some other mathematical subject. Candidates are informed that all
the foregoing subjects of the examination are equally obligatory upon them.

   At the end of each academical year, the pupils of the school are subjected to severe
examinations in analytical geometry, mechanics, physics, chemistry, descriptive geo-
metry, the description and effect of machines, architecture, and several of the higher

branches of algebra and mathematics.
   Drawing and French composition are included among the subjects of study, and in

the second year, the German language receives a portion of the attention of the stu-

Adents.  professorship of English was established in the school in 1830, at the

same time with the German professorship, and both these important languages were

taught in the school until the autumn of 1840.

The annual payment, or "pension," for education in the Polytechnic Schoolis

only 1000 francs, or 401.; and there are also twenty-four bursarships, of 1000 francs

each per annum, of which twelve are placed at the disposal of the minister of war,

eight belong to the minister of the interior, and four to the minister of the marine,

Nofor the students.  pupil is, however, allowed to receive either a bursarship, or a

half-bursarship, unless his name has been included in the first two-thirds of the ad-

mission list, and unless he has previously addressed a request for this emolument

at the time of inscribing his name.

A strict system of military discipline is maintained in the school ; duelling is for-

bidden,  under  pain of expulsion  to  both  parties,  if a  challenge  is  accepted                                  games of

chance are illegal, as well as smoking ; and no books, printed papers, or drawings

are allowed to be introduced, without special leave. Unconditional obedience to

every command of the superior officers of the school, is a fundamental rule of the in-

stitution ; the pupils are ordered on all occasions to salute their officers ; they are re-
quired always to appear in their uniform, both in and out of school, and they are

not allowed to hold or form any society, or secret deliberation, or to print anything

in anyperiodical publication ; andtheymust noteven be presentat any ceremony of any

body or association, without the special permission of the commandant of the school.

   Any pupil who remains absent from the school for three days, without communi-
cating the cause to the commandant, ceases thereby to belong to the school. Two

days only are allowed in each week on which the pupils may go out into the town ;

on Sunday, from the termination of the military parade, at a quarter past nine in the

morning, until ten at night ; and on Wednesday, from half-past two in the afternoon,

until half-past eight p.m. in summer, and nine in winter. On these two days, the

parents and guardians of the pupils, and persons furnished with permissions from

them, are allowed to see the pupils in the parlour of the school, from three p.m. to

a quarter before five p.m.

   The pupils draw by lot for the seats which they occupy in the lecture-rooms, on
first entering the school, and they always retain the same seats.

   Exact notes are kept of their behaviour as well as of their proficiency, and marks

of credit are granted to them accordingly.

  A large staff of officers, examiners, and professors is maintained in the school, among
whom are the well known names of Bourdon and Gay-Lussac : a certain number of

extra masters are also privileged to give lessons in fencing, dancing, and music, and

the school society is supplied with a physician, a surgeon, assistant surgeons, and

numerous subordinate officers.
   All the officers, including the commandant of the school, receive the full pay belong-

ing to their rank, as well as one-third in addition to their pay, and the whole of the
salaries are paid to the officers and others out of the funds of the school, which are

included in the budget of the minister of war.

  No ecclesiastical control is exercised over the students in the school, and no di-

stinctions are made on account of religious opinions persons of any denomination

are admitted into the school, and in fact, the pupils are left entirely to themselves

with respect to religion. The pupils are divided into four companies, to each of
which are attached several sub-officers, out of their own body. Tlrey hold their rank

only for one year, subject to re-appointment, and their promotion is considered as a
mark of honourable distinction.

All orders of the superior officers are conveyed to the pupils of each company

through these sub-officers, who are further responsible for the good conduct of their

comrades, and are liable to be punished for them ; the sub-officers of the school also
wear the same gold chevrons on their uniform, which distinguish the sub-officers of

the same grade in the army.

Those pupils who do not pass the examinations with credit at the end of the first

year, cannot go up into the second year                                                                                                                                                                            and a similar failure at the end of  another

year, or even neglect during the daily examinations of the lectures, would cause them

to be immediately dismissed from the school.

The place which they occupy at the end of the second year in the examinations, de-

termines their order of admission into the public service ; and as only very few are an-

nually rejected, it may be said, that in general, the success of a candidate in the final

examinations is always followed by a commission in the artillery, the engineers, the

bridges and highways, the navy, or in some other department of the public service.

  On the 1st of April 1 840, there were 271 pupils in the Polytechnic School, of whom

139 were in the first year, and 132 in the second year : of the first-year men, four
only had been recommended to pass a second )'ear in the junior division of the school,

as they were not yet sufficiently advanced to enter on the second year's course of study;

and in the second year, eight had been authorized to remain an additional year in the

division, for various reasons.

Of the total number of 27 1 pupils, 56 were from the department of the Seine, in

which Paris is situated, 208 from other French departments, 2 from French colonies,

2 of British parents, 1 from Switzerland, 1 from Saxony, 1 from Trebizond.

   Besides these regular pupils, authorizations had been granted by the minister of

war to tiventy-six young men, who were not pupils of the school, to attend the lec-

tures, viz. sixteen in the division of the first year, and ten in the division of the se-

--cond j^ear. These voluntary students were of various nations : 8 French, 1 English,

1 American, 2 Swiss, 3 Italian, 2 Greek, 1 Spanish, 2 Russian, 1 Norwegian, 1 Hes-

sian, 1 Wurtemberger, 2 Portuguese, and 1 Brazilian.

   The body of professors is always recruited by young men of the greatest promise,

selected either from the school itself, or from the most distinguished scientific insti-

tutions of the country ; the general course of the studies is superintended by a council
of instruction, and the whole system is subject to the constant supervision of a council

of improvement .- these two councils are formed from the principal officers of the

school, and other men of science, and to their vigilance and able direction the Poly-

technic School is largely indebted for its efficiency.

  A council of discipline watches over the internal regulations of the school, and the

whole establishment is underthe special j urisdiction and authorit}' of the minister of war.

been reduced from 220, July 1840, to 130, July 1841 ; and that the people evinced
such a desire to obtain work that they walked three miles up Beachy Head for it.
Mrs. Gilbert entered into minute details of the system of husbandly pursued in the

On the Plymouth Breakwater. By Wm. Stuart, C. E., Superintendent of

                                                   the Work.

   The importance of a breakwater at Plymouth attracted the attention of the Ad-
miralty in 1806, and in February of that year Mr. Rennie and Mr. Whidbey, the
Master Attendant of Woolwich Dockyard, were directed to survey the Sound. As
the results of their survey, they submitted a plan for a stone breakwater, and gave
their opinions upon several plans previously proposed. The stone breakwater was to
be 1700 yards in length, at the top of which the middle was to be straight for 1000
yards, and each end, 350 yards in length, was to incline at an angle of about 20° to
the straight part : it was to be ten yards in width at the level often feet above the low

water of an ordinary spring tide, with a slope of three to one on the south or sea side,
and one and a half to one on the north or land side ; and to be constructed by blocks
of limestone thrown promiscuously into the sea on the intended line, with a cut stone
pier on the top. This plan was favourably received, and an Order in Council was issued
in June 1811, for the execution of the work, and in August 1812 the first stone was
deposited. Mr. Stuart then described in detail the progress of the work, and the va-
rious alterations found advisable. The south slope is regularly formed with squared
blocks of limestone and dove-tailed granite, from the level of low water spring tides,
with a slope of five to one, and the north side with rough blocks of limestone, with

Aa slope of two to one. lighthouse is now in course of construction at the western

end, and a buttress for the protection of the lighthouse, and securing the front

of the south slope. The force of the sea is so great, that stones of fifteen or
even twenty tons have been taken from low water and carried over the top of the
work. According to the original calculation of Messrs. Rennie and Whidbey,
2,000,000 tons would be required for th^ work, but owing to the various exten-
sions, the quantity is much increased , and between the 12th of August 1812, and
the 31st of July 1841, 3,377,068 tons had been deposited. The estimated cost of the
original breakwater was 1,013,900/.; but owing to the alterations in the work, and
an increase in the materials, the whole outlay to the present moment is 1,111,700/.,
and the cost of the breakwater when completed, including the lighthouse, will not

exceed 1,300,000. Various other breakwaters have been proposed to the Admiralty :
one of cast iron in 1804 ; two of stone, and one of wood, by Mr. Bentham, in 1811.
The wooden breakwater was to consist of 117 floats of wood, of a triangular or
prismatic forai ; each float thirty feet in breadth and depth, forty feet in length, to be
moored by iron chains, at a cost of 201,805/. ; but the Admiralty resolved on a stone
breakwater, and the thirty years' experience since elapsed have confirmed the author
in his opinion of the wisdom of the choice. The stone breakwater is said to have

occasioned an accumulation of mud and silt within the harbour, and a consequent

diminution in depth of the water to the extent of five feet. In the original report of

--Messrs. Rennie and Whidbey, is contained the following statement : " From con-

versing with pilots and various other intelligent men whom we met at Plymouth, we

have reason to believe, that the depth of water in the Sound is on the decrease, by

the settlement of mud and silt brought down by the rivers from the interior country,
and also by the embankment of the mud lands within, thus diminishing the ancient

receptacles of the water of the tide, which both in its flux and reflux occasions a
powerful scour in its passage through the Sound." The fact is, that a recent inclosure
of 275 acres of the backwater of the Catwater above the Lara Bridge had just taken

place ; it seems evident that mud and silt were then in the Sound. On a considera-

tion of the whole question, Messrs. Rennie and Whidbev were of opinion that there

                                        h2
100 REPORT--1841.

was no danger of the Sound becoming more shallow, and that no further deposition

of silt or mud would take place, except immediately within or without the breakwater.
In consequence of a communication, made in July 1838, to the naval authorities at this

port, to the effect that a deposit was then going on in the Sound, the Admiralty di-
rected Mr. James Walker to report fully on the subject, and the best means for pro-
viding against the apprehended injury to the anchorage. After a long and laborious

investigation, and a minute survey, during which no less than 2000 soundings were
taken, Mr. Walker reported, that, taking the mean of the soundings that could be
affected by the breakwater, the result was that there was but very little increase or
decrease, and that, if there was any decrease of depth in the Sound (except close to
the br.;ak water, and which could produce no practical evil), this was certain, that if

--it had taken place, it was but small, certainly not enough to cause alarm, or to

justify expensive measures for removing the cause. As to the destruction of the break-
water by the Pholas, though connected with the breakwater since its commencement,
Mr. Stuart never saw a perforation in the limestone by the Pholas, except between
the low water of spring and of neap tides ; and these perforations only occur on the
outer surface of the stone, and to a depth not exceeding three inches. He never dis-
covered any such perforation in the interior of the work, although he had recently had
occasion to remove stones, by the aid of the diving-bell, at the depth of five feet be-
low low water, and which had been deposited there upwards of twenty-five years.
Loose stones had been taken up from beaches, and from the bottom of the Sound,
perforated by the Pholas, but they must have been perforated before they got there,
for the Pholas had never, in such cases, been found alive.

On a Floating Breakwater. By Captain Taylor, B.N.

The breakwaters hitherto constructed have generally consisted of solid masonry,

thus presenting an unyielding obstacle to the waves, permitting accumulations of mud

and sand behind them, causing enormous outlay by the constant dilapidation from

the force of the waves and compressed air, and not affording the security to shipping

and life which is required, and maybe afforded by other means. The floating break-

water consists of floating sections framed of timber strongly moored                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  these sections
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

yield to the shocks of the sea, and admit the waves to pass through them, and by thus

dividing the waves, reduce them to an open and harmless state. The depth of these

sections vary according to the situations in which they are employed. The sea in the

most tempestuous weather is said to be tranquil at the depth of sixteen or eighteen

feet below the surface                                                                              a breakwater, therefore, immerged to that depth, and present-
                                                                                                 ;

ing six or eight feet above the surface, is sufficient to form a safe harbour on the most

boisterous coast. The angle of inclination which the section presents to the wave is

that pointed out by nature in the Mew-stone, viz. 35 degrees. Stone breakwaters

check the ground tides, and cause accumulations of mud and deposits which other-

wise would go seaward, and are peculiarly subject to the action of boring shells, con-

stantly at work below the dove-tailed stone ; and cavities being formed, large portions

are occasionally blown up. The destruction of the wood by the Teredo is prevented

in the floating breakwater by tarring the wood with a preservative mixture, and the
worm can make no lodgment on a prism floating upon the surface ; besides, it can be

scrubbed and tarred as often as required. The distinction between waves and break-

ers is very important, the former being an undulation, the latter being accompanied

with a translation of the mass, and capable therefore of exerting extraordinary forces
on the masses opposed to them, when applied force to force. The breakwater is

formed of hollow framework                                                                                                                                 it fills with an inert body of water, which requires a
                                                                                                                                                        ;

considerable force to be put in motion or driven through the breakwater, and each

succeeding wave expends its force upon the preceding, therefore each wave becoming

inert, acts as a resisting medium to the others, almost entirely independent of the

caisson itself, with but slight strain to the moorings, and thus passes broken and

tranquil to the inner or land side, which is rendered completely calm, instead of acting
with immense violence upon soUd masses. The construction of this breakwater is so

adjusted that its beam is limited to 20 feet, for beyond this it would present too solid
a resistance, and add to the strain on the moorings and framework. This was clearly

demonstrated by practical experiments.

   Capt. Taylor, R.N. explained, by reference to a model, his construction and ap-
plication of a shield to protect the paddle-wheels of steam-boats from the shock or
action of the sea -when riding at anchor, or sailing or scudding under canvas when
the steam power is not applied ; also his method of disconnecting the paddles with-

out stopping the engines. He also proposed to apply the steam power of vessels for

the purpose of working the windlass.

On the Propulsion of Vessels by the Trapezium Paddle-ivheel and Screw,

                              By G. Rennie, F.R.S.

   The author gave an account of the various experiments to which he had been led,
on the propulsion of vessels by various forms of paddle-floats and by the screw. It was
generally admitted that the paddle-wheel was the best means of propulsion with
which engineers were at present acquainted, and various attempts had been made
for its improvement. There are several objections to the square or rectangular floats,
particularly the shock on entering the water, and the drag against the motion of the
wheel on the float quitting the water ; both of which give rise to considerable vi-

brations. He had been led, in considering the improvement of the paddle-wheel, to

have recourse to nature, and the form of the foot of the duck had particularly attracted
his attention. The web of the duck's foot is shaped so that each part has a relation
to the space through which it has to move, that is, to the distance from the centre of
motion of the animal's leg. Hence he was led to cut off the angles of the rectangular
floats, and he found that the resistance to the wheel through the water was not di-
minished. Pursuing these observations and experiments, he was led to adopt a float
of a trapezium or diamond shape, with its most pointed end downwards. These
floats enter the water with their points downwards, and quit it with their points
upwards ; they arrive gradually at their full horizontal action, without shocks or
vibrations, and after their full horizontal action, quit the water without lifting it, or
producing any sensible commotion behind. After a great variety of experiments, he
found that a paddle-wheel of one half the width and weight and with trapezium floats,
was as effective in propelling a vessel as a wheel of double the width and weight
with the ordinary rectangular floats. The Admiralty had permitted him to fit Her
Majesty's steam-ship African yvith these wheels, and he had perfect confidence in the
success of the experiment. Another means of propulsion was the screw, which had
been applied with success by Mr. Smith in the Archimedes. In examining the wings
of birds and the tails of swift fish, he had been particularly struck with the adapta-
tion of shape to the speed of the animals. The contrast between the shape of the tail of
the codfish, a slow-moving fish, and the tail of the mackerel, a rapid fish, was very

--remarkable, the latter going off much more rapidly to a point than the former. From

these observations hewas led to try a screw with fourwings, of a shape somewhat similar

to these, but bent into a conical surface, the outline being a logarithmic spiral. He

found also that certain portions of these might be cut off without diminishing the
efi"ect. With respect to ascertaining the friction of the screw on the water, great diffi-
culty existed ; but he would refer to his experiments, published some years ago in the
Philosophical Transactions, in which he measured the friction of the water against a
body revolving in it, by the time which a given weight took to descend; this body con-
sisted of rings, and he found that the friction or resistance through the water did not
increase in proportion to the number of rings. The results of the experiments made
since with the African, opposite the measured mile in Long Reach in the rit'er Thames,
and also with an iron steam-boat in the river Shannon, have fully realized the expec-
tations of the author.

   On Truscotfs Plan for Reefing Paddle- Wlieels. By W. Chatfield.

    Mr. Chatfield described, by reference to a model, an improved paddle-wheel, the
principal feature of which was a new application of the principle of feathering and
reefing. Each paddle or float is attached to an axis passing through its centre, with
a crank at the extremity of the axis, and the feathering is effected by the motion of a
roller attached to this crank, and moving in a groove eccentric to the wheels. The
radii of the paddle-wheel are connected at their extremities by a chain instead of a
rigid rim, and the reefing is effected by drawing the radii together, like the folding

of a fan, by means of a peculiar arrangement of the clutch box at the centre of the

wheel.

On a Plan of Disengaging and Reconnecting the Paddle- Wlieels of Steam-

                         Engines. By J. Grantham.

There are four cases in which it may be desirable to disconnect the paddle-wheels

from the steam-engine in steam vessels, viz. when the vessel is on a long voyage,
and the fuel must be economized as much as possible by using the sails on every fa-

vourable opportunity ; when the engines are damaged, and, the vessel being close to

a lee shore, it is necessary to disengage the engines quickly, to allow the vessel to

make sail ; when some derangement has taken place, and the engines are allowed to

continue to work imperfectly to the end of the voyage, rather than detain the vessel

by causing  the  paddles  to  drag  through  the water while  the  engines  are  stopped
                                                                                                                 ;

when, the vessel being at anchor, the action of the swell and tide on the paddle-floats,

while stationary, causes a great additional strain on the cables, which would be ob-

viated could the wheels play freely. The Admiralty had called attention to the subject,

by inviting plans for effecting it. Several had been proposed for disconnecting the pad-

dles, but Mr. Grantham is not aware of any plan having been proposed by which the

wheels could be readily reconnected in a heavy sea. The crank pins are usually fixed

in the cranks of the intermediate shaft, a little play being allowed in the eye of the

crank of the paddle shaft, to prevent the crank pins from breaking when the centres

of the three shafts vary from a straight line by the yielding of the vessel. For the

purpose of disengaging and reconnecting, a brass box of a rectangular form is inserted

in the eye of the crank of the paddle shaft, which can be moved several inches by means

of a screw at the back of the crank. The eye of the crank is so made that two of its

sides may be cut away, and through these openings the crank pin can pass when the

box is drawn back, or the disengaging effected. The brass box has one of its sides,

which restrain the crank pin when in gear, cut away one or two inches to assist in

reconnecting the engine, which is effected by screwing the box out one or two inches,

or just so far that the crank pin can pass the side which has been cut away, and come

in contact with the higher side. This is the correct position for reconnecting, which

is accomplished by a single turn of the screw.

                         On Captain Couch's Chock Channels.

   Mr. Snow Harris explained and illustrated, by a model and drawings, the safety

chock channel, for allowing the masts and rigging of vessels to be easily disengaged

when the masts are carried away. Many cases have occurred in which, with the

rigging and ordinary channels, the greatest danger has been incurred, in consequence

of not being able to get clear of wreck. The ordinary channels may be blown up by
the sea ; whereas, if made solid, on Capt. Couch's plan, all danger from this source

will be avoided, and the sailors would be at once able to clear the vessel of any wreck.

      On a System of Trussing for the Roadways of Suspension Bridges.

                                 By J. M. Rendel.

    Mr. Rendel placed before the Section a model of the Montrose Suspension Bridge,
the roadway of which had been recently restored, and a peculiar system of trussing
adopted. Suspension bridges were peculiarly subject to undulatory motions, which
proved extremely destructive to them. These undulatory motions arise from the

action of the wind, and the circumstances are such that the wind may tend to raise

the roadway at one end, and depress it at the other; and various means had been de-
 vised to prevent these motions. In 1838 a considerable portion of the roadway of
the Montrose Bridge was destroyed, and Mr. Rendel being employed to restore it, it
struck him that if great stiffness were given to the roadway by a system of longitu-

dinal trussing, the desired object would be attained. He adopted, therefore, a system

of vertical and longitudinal trussing, extending above and below the line of the road-
way, so that the neutral axis of the truss is in the roadway. This had succeeded
most completely. In an ordinary gale of wind, the original roadway would be sub-
ject to a wave of from three to five feet in height, but he was satisfied that the present

roadway is not subject to a wave of as many inches. The weight of the roadway has

not been increased by more than five or six per cent.

Remarks on the Connexion which exists between Improvements in Pitwork

        and the Duty of Steam-engines in Cornwall. By J. S. Enys.

   After adverting to the admission of the truth of progressive increase of duty, it was
shown that considerable changes have been made in the course of seventy years, in the
methods by which water is Hfted out of the mines in Cornwall; and that in compa-
ring the duty of earlier periods, an allowance of the difference of the Imperial and
Winchester bushel of coal ought to be made. The distinction between horse-power

and duty, pointed out by Mr Parkes, was alluded to : one excludes, the other includes,

the friction of the pitwork ; and the remarks attached to each in Lean's report, show

the necessity of adverting to the different conditions of the pitwork, in an attempt to
estimate with accuracy the relative merit of different engines separate from the pit-

work. In an endeavour, some time ago, to trace the causes of the great variation of the
duty, a small amount of expansion was observed in engines remarkable for a low duty,

-- --and the reasons assigned were, either weak pitwork flat rods heavy load per square
--inch on the piston, and old boilers and often the joint action of the above causes.

The strength of the pitwork, or of the boilers, in different cases, seems to become the
limit of expansion in the engines. In reference to deficiency of water from pumps, in
proportion to the calculated quantities, on which duty is founded, two causes have

--operated in inducing a strong belief that it is less than at any former period : 1 . Greater

attention to the pitwork by the managers of the mines, under whose care it is placed,

--to the exclusion of the engineers of the steam-engine by which it is worked. 2. The

general employment of the plunger-pump, the latter instantly shows the slightest
defect of the packing, and allows of an easy remedy ; while the bucket-pump, on the
contrary, does not show the defects in the packing ; and the operation of tightening

--it is attended with great difficulty, so much so, as often to cause the repacking to

be delayed to the last moment that the pump will lift water. The first cause, though

it has a tendency to. decrease duty in proportion to improved water delivery, has in a
still greater degree the tendency to reduce the friction of the pitwork on a given load :
yet it is not easy to assign the exact values : on the whole, a reduction of total re-
sistances probably occurs in shafts of equal depth ; but, on the other hand, the great

increased depth of many shafts obviously produces a greater proportional friction on
a given load. Under these circumstances, it becomes the fairer method to select the

duty of engines working the deepest shafts, for a comparison with the duty of the ear-

lier periods, when engines were worked so differently as regards the steam. Mr. J.

W. Henwood (Huel Towan) estimates the deficiency of water delivery at 7 or 8 per

cent. ; Mr. T. Wicksteed (Holmbush) 10 per cent, water from three lifts measured
and weighed ; Mr. Enys (Eldon's engine. United Mines) 4 per cent., four strokes of
the engine with one plunger-lift having been measured. The absence of attention in
earlier times can only be assumed from the known habits of the miner, and the ab-
surd stories prevalent of particular instances of neglect. Another great, but almost
inappreciable change, has occurred in the increase of weight in the rods for a given
load, due to deeper shafts and more expansion ; but the circumstance of the greater
weight of rods admitted of the reciprocal action of a still greater amount of expansion
in Watt's engines : in heavy pitwork, the accumulated force stored up at the com-
mencement is restored at the end of the stroke. The only decrease of duty is occasioned
by a greater amount of friction in the gudgeons of the balance beams, arising from the
weights required to balance the rods ; but, on the other hand, a direct gain is obviously
due to the smaller quantity of water required to be expended as steam, to produce,
by means of greater expansion, the same mean power. The present form of rod,
with lifts alternately on each side, where the shaft admits of this method, was pro-
bably due to Watt or Murdoch. Smeaton, at the Chacewater Atmospheric Engine, in
1775, seems to have effected the introduction of one rod for a portion of the shaft,
and dispensed with the older practice of bringing up to the arc of the beam a separate
rod for each lift. The plunger-pump seems to have effected another change of some im-
portance, in the velocity with which the larger portion of water is raised. The engines
arc usually made to go, out-of-doors, at rather more than half the velocity of the in-
door stroke, the piston moving in-doors from 240 to 260 feet, and out-of-doors from
--104 REPORT 1841.

 120 to 130 feet per minute; the velocity of the plunger is usually four-fifths of this
amount, or 100 to 120 feet per minute. Still a portion of the water, from one- third
to one-sixth, is raised at three-fourths of the higher velocity ; recently larger valves
have been placed below the plunger than above, with a view of equalizing the resist-
ance of the water on passing the valves. In commencing motion, after the state of

rest to which pumping engines are brought, it is possible a greater power may be

employed than is required to continue it ; still the term variable load, formerly adopted

by the writer of this paper, may be too strong. In an attempt to value friction by

the area of the rubbing surfaces of the packing of the plungers, it appeared the una-

nimous opinion of many of the best pitmen, that water could be kept from escaping
with less friction by means of twelve-inch than with nine-inch packing, in a twelve-

--inch plunger-lift, a circumstance that requires attention, not only in this, but pro-

bably under numerous other conditions of friction calculations. In regard to the
effect of expansion on the pitwork in producing a variable strain during the load, it
was observed, that with twelve times expansion on an engine recently erected, of
Watt's construction, including clearance steam, the variation was found by an indi-
cator to be as 8 to 1 at the end of the stroke ; but that in a new engine with combined
cylinder, by Sims, in which the steam is expanded twelve times, viz. three times in a
small cylinder, and subsequently four times in a larger cylinder during the out- door
stroke, this power being converted into a constant quantity in-doors by means of a
balance, the variation of pressure would be about as 2 to 1 only ; and that in Horn-
blower's or Woolf's, if worked with high steam, under the condition of twelve times

--expansion, including clearance steam, the variation might be roughly taken as 3 to 1
    that the commercial part of the question of more or less expense in engines or
pitwork, would determine the relative advantages, on the whole, of each engine for
lifting water from deep mines. It seems that expansion has not been carried out to so
great an extent when the load is near the end of the beam, and when the enormous
balance weights, usual in Cornish pitwork, are not required to be applied, though it
is obvious that this condition causes less pitwork friction.

On an improved Sight for Rijles and other Fire-arms. By Chahles

                                  Thornton Coathupe.

   As a substitute for the ordinary steel-leaved rifle sight, whose heights are regulated
for certain definite ranges (between which an imaginary allowance for the correct
elevation is all that can be effected), Mr. Coathupe recommends another upon a dif-
ferent principle, equally simple, and by which any elevation may be readily obtained
with accuracy, commencing with the lowest, or point-blank range, and ascending by

the least possible increments to the extreme range for all useful purposes.

    It should be constructed by first forging a piece of iron, which, when filed up flat,
and square at the edges, shall furnish a wedge, or inclined plane, from six to eight
inches in length, and from three-eighths to half an inch in width, having its thicker
extremity about three-eighths of an inch, and its thinner end about one-sixteenth of
an inch in thickness.

   Upon this inclined plane a piece of steel, of similar length and width to that of the

inclined plane, but of uniform thickness throughout, and having its edges filed so as
to exhibit a dove-tail section, must be fixed, the wider surface being uppermost.

Upon this dove-tail plate a steel sight, with a small notch filed in the centre of its

upper edge, must be fitted so as to traverse steadily from end to end. The dove-tail

plate may be attached to the inclined plane by means of gunsmiths' solder ; and when

thus fixed, a narrow groove must be filed longitudinally through its substance, com-
mencing in a median line upon its upper surface, the bottom of the groove being par-
allel to the base of the inclined plane. The whole must then be affixed to the rifle
barrel, in a line corresponding with the axis of the bore, by means of three steel screws,
whose heads must be countersunk.

   It is evident, that if the upper edge of this traversing sight, when at the commence-
ment of the inclined plane, be so adjusted to the perpendicular heights of the in-
clined plane, and of the sight near the muzzle, that a line passing through a central

point in each shall be parallel to the axis of the bore, this will be the position for the
point-blank range of the rifle ; also, that if the traversing sight be pushed further
along the inclined plane, the angle of elevation, and consequently the range, will be

                                                                               I

proportionally and gradually increased, until it has traversed to the extent of its limit
and as, during its passage, it will be gradually approximating to the upper sight, there
will be an increasing ratio of range as the distance between the two points of sight

diminishes.

   The plate upon which the lower sight traverses should be graduated throughout its
length for every ten yards of distance within the range of the barrel (the charge and

quality of the powder being uniform). By means of the thumb, the sight may be in-

stantly adjusted to accord with the estimated distance of the object from the observer.

 On the Granite Quarries of Dartmoorf-and their Railways and Machinery,

                                   By W. Johnson.

     The surface granite of Dartmoor, existing in detached blocks, has been long em-
 ployed in the neighbourhood for ordinary building purposes, but the quarried granite
 was first brought into the market by the Haytor Granite Company about the year
 1820. The construction of a stone tramway allowed of the granite being shipped at
, Teignmouth ; it now competes with the best Aberdeenshire stone, since the lightness
 of its tint, the fineness of its texture, and the very large blocks in which it can be ob-
 tained, render it for some purposes unrivalled, and it has been extensively employed
 in many public buildings, both in the metropolis and other places. The completion
 in 1825 of the Plymouth and Dartmoor Railway, of the length of 25 miles and uni-

 form rise of 1 in 94, aifords ready transport for the granite of the western face of the
 moor from Fogginton and other parts adjacent, and the facilities with which these
 quarries are worked are very great. Strong timber stages with travelling frames, and
 upon the frames powerful traversing crabs, avoiding thereby the labour and delay of

 lifting by the ordinary' means of derricks and cranes, are now in the course of con-
 struction. The travelling frames, with the crabs upon them, can be transferred from
 one fine of scafibld to another, so that power may be accumulated to any extent upon
  one stage, so as to operate on blocks of extraordinary size. The magnitude of the

  blocks in which the granite can be procured from this quarry, renders it peculiarly
 fitted for the largest works of the engineer. The beds already accessible lie at great
  depths below the surface, and yield stone of the greatest compactness, strength, and
  uniformity of colour, and the horizontal disposition of the rock allows of the removal
  of stone of fair forms and in blocks of the largest size.

On Arnott's Stove, and the Construction of Descending Flues, and their Ap-

Byplication to the purposes of Ventilatioji.  J. N. Hearder.

   The general advantages of Arnott's stoves in economizing fuel, avoiding smoke, and
regulating the temperature, are well known ; but these stoves are attended with some
disadvantages, of which the danger of explosion and imperfect ventilation are the
most serious. The liability to explosion Mr. Hearder considers to arise from the

construction of the stove, in having the upper door air-tight, the only aperture for air
being the valve aperture of the ash-pit. The air so admitted is immediately decom-
posed, and nearly the whole of its oxygen is abstracted, so that by the time it has
passed up through the fuel, and reached the upper chamber of the stove, it has not oxy-
gen enough left to support combustion. The heat evolved by the lower stratum of fuel,
acting upon the upper stratum of fresh or unignited fuel, liberates from it the inflam-

Amable gas which it contains, and which also accumulates in the top of the stove.

mixture is then formed analogous to the fire-damp of coal mines, ready for explosion
whenever the requisite oxygen or degree of temperature shall be present. Under these

circumstances, should the door be opened, a burst of flame outwards may be the re-
sult ; or should a pufl:' of wind down the chimney carry the mixture down through
the ignited fuel, an explosion may ensue. Other causes, such as the sudden shutting or
opening of the door of an apartment, may occasion the downward draught and conse-

quent explosion. Now carburetted hydrogen will not explode when the proportion of

the air to the hydrogen exceeds a certain limit, so that if air be supplied to the top of

the stove, so as greatly to preponderate over the hydrogen, the latter will burn off in

flame at the moment of its formation, or be carried up the flue. Mr. Hearder, there-

fore, proposes as a remedy, perforations through the lower edge of the upper door, so

that air may be admitted on a level with the top edge of the fire-brick, through which
--106 REPORT 1841.

a constant in-draught of atmospheric air will be ensured, sufficient to obviate the evil.
The heat evolved by the perfect combustion of this inflammable gas, under these cir-
cumstances, will, he says, more than compensate for the admission of cold air into

the upper part of the stove. The perforations just mentioned will also obviate, in a
great measure, the want of ventilation. The author described a small rarefying ap-
paratus, to be inserted in the vertical shaft connected with a descending flue, in which
apparatus a small culm fire is to be constantly kept. The expense of this is not more
than one penny per day ; and Mr. Hearder has found by experience that the draught
produced by this means is so powerful as to ensure the success of an underground
flue several hundreds of feet in length.
