from among the Members (not Associates) present at tl\c Meeting whose as-
sistance they may particularly desire. The Sectional Committees thus con-
stituted shall have power to add to their number from day to day.

   The List thus formed is to be entered daily iu the Sectional Minute-Book,
and a copy forwarded without delay to the Printer, who is charged with

xlviii  --REPORT 1873,

Report of the Council for the Year 1872-73 presented to the General
     Committee at Bradford, on Wednesday, September 1.7th, 1873.

    During the past year the Council have received Reports from the General
Treasurer ; and his account for the year will bo presented to the General
Committee this daj''.

   The Council have had under their consideration the three resolutions which
were referred to them by the General Committee at Brighton, They beg to

--report upon the action they have taken upon each case.
        First Resolution. " That the Council be requested to take such steps
   as they deem desirable to induce the Colonial Office to afford sufficient aid
    to the Observatory at Mauritius to enable an investigation of the Cyclones
    in the Pacific Ocean to be carried on there"*.
    In accordance with this Resolution the following correspondence took
place between Dr. Carpenter, the President of the Association, and the Right
Honourable the Earl of Kimberley, Secretary of State for the Colonies :

                                                      " British Association for tbc Advancement of Science,
                                                            22 Albemarle Street, W., December 20, 1872.

  --" My Loud, On behalf of the British Association, I have the honour to

bring under your Lordship's notice the following statement respecting the
position of the Observatory at the Mauritius :

    " The Mauritius Observatory is for the most part a Meteorological and
Magnetical Observatory. As a Meteorological station, Mauritius is most
important ; and tlie present Director of the Observatory, Mr. Charles Meldrum,
has taken advantage of his position to work out several important Meteoro-
logical problems as far as his means have allowed him.

   He'·' has fostered the growth, if he did uot originate, the Meteorological

fjociety of Mauritius, of which he is the active Secretarj-, and his researches
have \>QQa materially aided by these means.

   " He has collated the logs of vessels crossing the Indian Ocean, extending

over a period of between twenty and thirty years, and has derived from these
some very important results. In the first place, it has been almost established
by these observations that the behaviour of the barometer at the ilauritius
affords an indication of storms taking place between that island and the

Cape of Good Hope. By a study of these logs of ships he is also able to tell

in what directions such storms travel, and thus he is able to give very
valuable advice to ships' masters who should happen to be at the Mauritius.
Moreover, Mr. Meldrum's recent observations tend to show that the cyclones
in the Indian Ocean are periodical, and occur most frequently during those
years when there are most sun-spots.

    " In addition to this work, Mr. Meldrum's duties require him constantly

to attend to the routine work of his observatory, to keep the time, &c. He

is almost unprovided with assistants ; and if he happens to be unwell the

current work of the observatory is liable in a measure to be stopped. On
account of overwork, Mr. Meldrum has lately been unwell for two months,

 although uot so unwell as to put a stop to all his scientific labours.

 --^ The resolution -was adopted by the Council, with the following modification: "That

 the Council take steps to induce the Colonial Office to afford sulficient pecuniary aid to
the Observatory at Slauritius to enable an investigation of Cyclones to be carried on
 there."
       REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.                                           xlix

" The importance of maintaining the sequence of the observations in the

Mauritius Observatory, of further collating the logs of ships, and of con-

tinuing the inquiry into the periodicity of cyclones, has induced the British

Association to urge upon your Lordship the necessity of affording additional
assistance to Mr. Meldrum, to enable him to pursue these labours and perform

his duties in a satisfactory manner.

   " It may be assumed that such assistance, to be efficient, will cost about
^300 a year beyond the present cost of the establishment ; and if it is to be

of value for the purpose of the investigation into the periodicity of cyclones,

this additional allowance will have to be continued for a period of about

ten years.
    " I trust that the scientific importance of this subject will induce your

Lordship to give this matter your favourable consideration, and to place Mr.
Meldrum in a position to complete the inquiries he has commenced with so

much success.

                                   " I have the honour to be,

                                 " My Lord,

                                    "Your most obedient Servant,

       (Signed)                             " William B. Caepenteb,

                                                                   President of the British Association."

receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, urging, on behalf of the British

Association, the necessity of affording additional assistance to Mr. Meldrum in

his labours at the Mauritius Observatory.

" The Colonial Government is well aware of the value of the Meteoro-

logical researches now carried on at their Observatory by Mr. Meldnim ; but
the state of the finances of the Colony is such that no increase can be made

to any of the Government establishments except on urgent grounds.

- " The Secretary of State will, however, in deference to the wish ex-

pressed by the British Association, forward a copy of your letter to the

Governor for his consideration and report.

--" My Lord, I have had the honour to receive your Lordship's despatch

(No. 302) of the 20th ultimo ou the subject of the assistance to be afforded

to Mr. Meldrum of the Mauritius Observatory.
   " 2. Some slight increase was made in this year's estimates to the amount

voted for this purpose, but not to the extent proposed by the British

Association.

   " 3. The -whole stibjcct is one in respect to which I should be glad to be

informed of your Lordship's views and wishes.
   " 4. It is admitted, and indeed the increased grant is urged by the British

Association on this ground, that the benefit of Mr. Meldrum's investigations

is of general application, and that it is the advancement of science, and not

any special interest of Mauritius itself that is concerned. Under these cir-

cumstances I confess that it seems to me hardly just that the revenue of

Mauritius should bear the whole burden of these investigations, and that

the Imperial Treasury, or, at aU events, the Meteorological Society, might

be fairly called upon to defray a part of the expenses incurred.

    In consequence of this communication the Council requested the President

to urge upon the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury the

desirability of aifording such pecuniary aid to the Mauritius Observatory as
would enable the Director to continue his observations on the periodicitj' of

Cyclones; and an intimation has been received from Her Majesty's Govern-
ment that an inquiry into the condition, size, and cost of the Establishment
of the Mauritius is now being conducted by a Special Commission from
England, pending which inquiry no increase of expenditure upon the
Observatory can be sanctioned ; but that when the results of this inquiry
shall be made known the Secretary of State for the Colonies will direct

--the attention of the Governor to the subject.
        Second Resolution. " That, in the event of the Council having reason
    to believe that any changes aflPecting the acknowledged efficiency and
   scientific character of the botanical establishment at Kew are contemplated
   by the Government, the Council be requested to take such steps as in
   their judgment wiO. be conducive to the interests of botanical science in
    this country."
   The Council have not deemed it necessary to take any action upon this

--Resolution.
       Third Resolution. "That the Council be requested to take such steps
   as they may deem desirable to urge upon the Indian Government the pre-
   paration of a Photoheliograph and other instruments for solar observa-
   tion, with the view of assisting in the observation of the Transit of Venus
   in 1874, and for the continuation of solar observations in India."

   The Council communicated with His Grace the Duke of Argyll, the
Secretary of State for India, upon the subject, with the result cxi)lained in

the following correspondence :
                                                                         ;

                                                 22 Albemarle Street, W., November 27th, 1872.

--" My Lord Duke, On behalf of the British Association, I have the honour

to urge upon your Grace's consideration the importance of making adequate

preparation in India for the observation of the Transit of Venus in 1874, as

·well as of making provision for the continuation of solar observations in India,

a matter to -which the Council attach special importance.

" The observations ought to comprise both eye and photograpliie records

and the following instruments are specially recommended by the Council as

those which it is desirable to procure at once. The photographic records

shoiild be made in the manner determined upon by the Astronomer Royal

--and by M. Otto Struve for the llussian Government namely, by means of a

Photoheliograph, on the principle of the instrument which has been worked

at the Ivew Observatory during ten years, but improved both in the optical

and mechanical parts.

" Tor eye-observations it will be desirable to have a Telescope of the greatest

excellence, of 6-iuch aperture, mounted cquatorially iu the best manner, with

a clockwork driver. It is also desirable to have a 4-iuch telescope, mounted

cquatorially, and driven by clockwork.

  A'* transit instrument with clock, and one or two chronometers, and also

an Altazimuth Instrument.

"As the 6-inch equatorial would be available afterwards for Sun Observa-

tions, it would be desirable to fit it with a Spectroscope of sufiicient dispersive

power to permit of the prominences being observed efficiently.

   "The Council would recommend that the Heliograph should be worked

continuously iu India, inasmuch as such records are calciilated to throw

much light upon the causes of climatic changes, and it is impossible in any

one locality to secure a coutinuous record of the sun's activity : observations

of this nature are about to be proceeded with at the Eoyal Observatorj',

Greenwich ; but past experience has shown that, on the average, half the

days in the year are unproductive, and it is hoped that if India cooperates

the gaps may be filled up.

   " The Council of the Association trust that the importance of the subject
win induce your Grace to give the matter a favourable consideration.

" I have the honour to be,

       «' My Lord Duke,

acknowledge the receipt of yoiu- letter of the 27th ultimo, expressing the

desii'e of the Council of the British Association that provision may be made

in India for observation in that country of the Transit of Ycnus in 1874,
and for a continuation of solar observations in future,

I am to add that there is a Government Astronomer in the Madras Presi-
dency, and a Superintendent of the Colaba Observatory in the Bombay

to an observation in India of the Transit of the planet Venus in December

1874, 1 am directed to state, for the information of the Council of the British

Association for the Advancement of Science, that the Secretary of State for

India in Council, having reconsidered this matter, and looking to the number

of existing burdens on the revenues of India, and to the fact that the selection

of any station in that country was not originally contemplated for 'eye-

observations ' of the transit, has determined to sanction only the expendi-

ture (=£356 7s. del.) necessary for the purchase and packing of a Photo-

heliograph, and any further outlay that may be requisite for the adaptation

of such instruments as may be now in India available for the pui'pose of the

proposed observation.

" The Duke of Argyll in Council has been led to sanction thus much of

the scheme proposed by Lieut.-Colonel Tennant, in consequence of the recom-

mendation submitted by the Astronomer lloyal in favour of the use of pho-

tography for an observation of the transit at some place in Northern India.

Memorial from the Council of the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society to

                        the General Committee of the British Association.

   The Council of the Leeds Philoso^ihical and Literary Society desrie to
direct the attention of the General Committee of the British Association to a
question of legislation capable of affecting prejudicially a number of Societies
engaged in the promotion of science.

    Since the British Association recognizes as one of its functions the vigilant
observation through its Parliamentary Committee of current legislation affect-

ing the interests of science, your memorialists have much confidence in bring-

ing the subject before it.

    The Rating BiU introduced by Government during the last Session of Par-
liament, proposed to withdraw from Scientific aiid Literary Societies the ex-
emption from rating specially conferred upon tliem by an Act passed about

thirty years ago.

   The Institution which your memorialists represent, like many others,

would have suffered seriously in its capability of maintaining a large Public

Museum had this Bill become law.

    After the discussion of the question in Parliament, your memorialists are
convinced that no sufficient reason exists for thus abstracting from the funds

of Scientific and Literary Societies a sum of money which is important to

their efficiency, but too small to affect apprcciablj^ the question of the distri-

bution of taxation. So many exemptions of religious and educational insti-

tutions were admitted by the amended Bill, that it could lay no claim to

 uniformity in its treatment of the subject of Rating.

    Your memorialists respectfully invite the attention of the General Com-

mittee of the British Association to this subject, Avith the view of maintain-
 ing the present exemption, should further legislation be undertaken.

                                                            Signed,

    By order of the Council of the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society,
                                                        Thomas Wilson, 1 rr cv

    ALEXANDER W. WILLIAMSON, Ph.D., F.R.S.,

                                         PRESIDENT.

   --Ladies and Gentlemen,

   Instead of rising to address you on this occasion I had hoped to sit quietly
amongst you, and to enjoy the intellectual treat of Listening to the words of

--a man of whom England may well be proud a man whose life has been

spent in reading the great book of nature, for the purpose of enriching his

--fellow men Avith a knowledge of its truths a man whose name is known
--and honoured in every corner of this planet to which a knowledge of science

has penetrated and, let me add, a man whose name will live in the grateful
memory of mankind as long as the records of such noble work are preserved.

   At the last Meeting of the Association I had the pleasure of proposing that
Dr. Joule be elected President for the Bradford Meeting, and our Council
succeeded in overcoming his reliLctance and in persuading him to accept that

office.

   Nobly would Joule have discharged the duties of President had his bodily
health been equal to the task ; but it became apparent after a while that he
could not rely upon sufficient strength to justify him in performing the duties
of the Chaii-, and, in obedience to the orders of his physician, he placed his
resignation in the hands of the Council about two months ago. When, under

these circumstances, the Council did me the great honour of asldng me to

accept their nomination to the Presidentship, I felt that their request ought

to have with me the weight of a command.
   For a good many years past Chemistry has been growing at a more and more

rapid rate, growing in the number and variety of facts which are added to its
domain, and not less remarkably in the clearness and consistency of the ideas
by which these facts are explained and systematized. The current literature

of chemical research extends each year to the dimensions of a small library
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and mere brief abstracts of the original papers published annually by the
Chemical Society, partly aided by a grant from this Association, take up
the chief part of a very stout volume. I could not, if I would, give you
to-night even an outline of the chief newly discovered compounds and of the

various changes which they undergo, describing each of them by its own
name (often a very long one) and recording the specific properties which give
to each substance its highest scientific interest. But I am sure that you
                                                                --

                                                      ADDRESS.      Ixxi

would not wish me to do so if I could ; for we do not meet here to study

chemistry                                             I conceive that we meet here for the purpose of considering what
                                                   ;

this wondrous activity in our science means, what is the use of it, and, true

to our object as embodied in the name of this Association, to consider what

we can do to promote the Advancement of Science. I propose to lay before

you some facts bearing on each of these questions, and to submit to you some

considerations respecting them.

In order to ascertain the meaning of the work which has been going on in

chemistry, it will, I think, be desirable for us to consider the leading ideas

which have been in the minds of chemists, and which guided their operations.

Now, since the father of modern chemistry, the great Dalton, gave to che-

mists a firm hold of the idea of Atoms, their labours have been continually

guided by that fundamental idea, and have confirmed it by a knowledge of

more and more facts, while at the same time steadily adding to our know-

ledge of the properties of atoms. Every chemist who is investigating a new
compound takes for granted that it must consist of a great number of atom-

clusters (called by him molecules), all of them alike, and each molecule con-

sisting of a certain number of atoms of at least two kinds. One of his first
endeavours is to ascertain how many atoms of each kind there are in each

molecule of the compound. I must not attempt to describe to you the various

kinds of experiment which he performs for the purpose of getting this infor-

mation, how each experiment is carried out with the aid of delicate instru-

ments and ingenious contrivances found by long experience to enable him to

obtain the most trustworthy and accurate results ; but I want to draw your

attention to the reasoning by which he judges of the value of such experi-

ments when they agree among themselves, and to the meaning which he at-

taches to their result.

If the result of his experiments does not nearly agree with any atomic for-

mula (that is, if no conceivable cluster of atoms of the kinds known to be in

the compound would on analysis give such results as those obtained), the

chemist feels sure that his experiments must have been faulty : either the

sample of substance which he worked upon contained foreign matter, or his

analyses were not made with due care. He sets to work again, and goes on

till he arrives at a result which is consistent with his knowledge of the com-

bining-properties of atoms. It is hardly necessary to say that even the best

experiment is liable to error, and that even a result obtained with the utmost

care cannot be expected to afford more than an approximation to the truth.

Every good analysis of a pure compound leads to results which approximate

to those required by the Atomic Theory ; and chemists trust so thoroughly

to the truth of that guide, that they correct the results of such analysis by the

aid of it.

The chemical idea of atoms serves for two purposes :

1. It gives a clear and consistent explanation of an immense number of facts

discovered by experiment, and enables us to compare them with one another

and to classify them.

   2. It leads to the anticipation of new facts, by suggesting new compounds
which may be made ; at the same time it teaches us that no compounds

can exist with their constituents in any other than atomic proportions,

and that experiments which imply the existence of any such compounds are

faulty.

  We have the testimony of the great Bcrzelius to the flood of light which the

idea of atoms at once threw on the facts respecting combining proportions

which had been accumulated before it was made known ; and from that time

                                                                        /2

forward its value has rapidly increased as each succeeding year augmented

the number ol' facts which it explained.

   AUow me at this point of my narrative to pause for a moment in order to

pay a tribute of respect and gratitude to the memory of one who has recently
passed from among us, and who in the time of his full activity was a leader
of the discoveries of new facts in the most difficult part of our science.
Liebig has been generally known in tliis countrj' through his writings on

agricultural chemistry, through his justly popular letters on chemistry, and other
writings, by means of which his brilliant intellect and ardent imagination

stimulated men to think and to work. Among chemists he was famed for
his numerous discoveries of new organic compounds, and their investigation

by the aid of improved methods ; but I believe that the greatest service which
his genius rendered to science was the establishment of the chemical school
of Giessen, the prototype of the numerous chemical schools for which Germany

is now so justly celebrated. I think it is not too much to say that the
Giessen laboratory, as it existed some thirty years ago, was the most efficient

organization for the promotion of chemistry which had ever existed.

   Picture to yourselves a little community of which each member was fired

with enthusiasm for learning by the genius of the great master, and of which

the best energies were concentrated on the one object of experimental inves-

tigation.

   The students were for the most part men who had gone through a full
curriculum of ordinary studies at some other University, and who were

attracted from various parts of the world by the fame of this school of

research.

Most of the leading workers of the next generation were pupils of Liebig

and many of them have established similar schools of research.

  We must not, however, overlook the foct that Liebig's genius and enthusiasm

would have been powerless in doing this admirable work, had not the rulers of

his Grand-Duchy been enlightened enough to know that it was their duty to

supply him with the material aids requisite for its successful accomphshment.

Numberless new compounds have been discovered under the guidance of

the idea of atoms ; and in proportion as our knowledge of substances and of

their properties became more extensive, and our view of their characteristics

more accurate and general, were we able to perceive the outlines of their natural

arrangement, and to recognize the distinctive characteristics of various classes

of substances. I wish I could have the pleasure of describing to you the origin

and nature of some of these admirable discoveries, such as homologous series,

types, radicals, &c.                                                                             but it is more to our purpose to consider the effect which
                                                                                              ;

they have had upon the idea of atoms, an idea which, still in its infancy, was

plunged into the intellectual turmoil arising from a variety of novel and original

theories suggested respectively by independent workers as best suited for the

explanation of the particular phenomena to which their attention was mainly

directed.

   Each of these workers was inclined to attach quite sufficient importance to
his own new idea, and to sacrifice for its sake any other one capable of inter-

fering with its due development.

   The father of the atomic theory was no more ; and the little infant had no
chance of Hfe, unless from its own sterling merits it were found useful in the
work still going on.

   What then was the result ? Did it perish like an ephemeral creation of
human fancy? or did it surN-ive and gain strength by the inquiries of those
who questioned Nature and knew how to read her answers ?
                                                                                                                                                                       ADDRESS.                            Ixxiii

Although anticipating my answer to these questions, you will probably be

surprised to hear the actual result which I have to record, a result so won-

derful that the more I think of it the more I marvel at it. Not only did

these various theories contain nothing at variance with the atomic theory
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

they were found to be natural and necessary developments of it, and to serve for

its application to a variety of phenomena which were unknown to its founder.
   Among the improvements of our knowledge of atoms which have taken

place, I ought to mention the better evaluations of the relative weight

of atoms of different kinds, which have been made since Dalton's time.

More accurate experiments than those which were then on record have

shown us that certain atoms are a little heavier or lighter than was then

believed, and the work of perfecting our observations is constantly going

on with the aid of better instruments and methods of operation. But,

apart from these special corrections, a more sweeping change has taken place,

not in consequence of more accurate experiments interpreted in the usual

way, but in consequence of a more comprehensive view of the best experi-

mental results which had been obtained, and a more consistent interpreta-

tion of them. Thus the atomic weight of carbon had been fixed at 6 by

Dumas's admirable experiments                                                                                                                                          and  it was quite conceivable that  a  still
                                                                                                                                                                    ;

more perfect determination might slightly increase or diminish this number.

But those who introduced the more sweeping change asserted in substance

that two of these supposed atoms, whatever may be the precise weight of

each, always are together and never separate from one another; and they

accordingly applied the term atom to that indivisible mass of carbon weighing
twice as much as a carbon atom had been supposed to weigh. So also with

regard to other elements, it has been shown that many atoms are really

twice as heavy as had been supposed, according to the original interpretation

of the best experiments. This change was brought about by what I may be

permitted to call the operation of stock-taking. Dalton first took stock of

our quantitative facts in a business-like manner ; but the amount and variety

of our chemical stock increased so enormously after his time, that the second

stock-taking absorbed the labours of several men for a good many years.
They were men of different countries and very various turns of mind ; but,
as I mentioned just now, they found no other fundamental idea to work

with than Dalton's ; and the result of their labo\irs has been to confirm the

truth of that idea and to extend greatly its application.

One of the results of our endeavours to classify substances according to their

natural resemblances has been the discovery of distinct family relationships

among atoms, each family being distinguished by definite characteristics.
Now, among the properties which thus characterize particular families of

atoms, there is one of which the knowledge gradually worked out by the
labours of an immense number of investigators must be admitted to consti-

tute one of the most important additions ever made to our knowledge of these

little masses.

I will endeavour to explain it to you by a simple example. An atom of

chlorine is able to combine with one atom of hydrogen or one atom of potas-

sium                     but it cannot combine with two                                                                                                                     atoms.  An atom of oxygen, on the
                      ;

other hand, can combine with two atoms of hydrogen or with two atoms of

potassium, or with one atom of hydrogen and one of potassium ; but we

cannot get it in combination with one atom of hydrogen or of potassium

solely.

   Again, an atom of nitrogen is known in combination with three atoms of

hydrogen ; while an atom of carbon combines with four of hydrogen. Other
Ixxiv                                       --REPORT 1873.

atoms are classified, from their resemblance to these respectively, as Monads,

Dyads, Triads, Tetrads, ifee.

The combining value which we thus recognize in the atoms of these several

classes has led us naturally to a consideration of the order in which atoms

are arranged in a molecule. Thus, in the compound of oxygen with hydro-

gen and potassium, each of these latter atoms is directly combined with the

oxygen, and the atom of oxygen serves as a connecting link between them.

Hydrogen and potassium have never been found capable of uniting directly

vvith one another ; but when both combined with one atom of oxygen they
are in what may be called indirect combination with one another through

the medium of that oxygen.

One of the great difficulties of chemistry some few years ago was to ex-

plain the constitution of isomeric compounds, those compounds whose mole-

cules contain atoms of like kinds and in equal numbers, but which differ

from one another in their properties. Thus a molecule of common ether

contains four atoms of carbon, ten atoms of hydrogen, and one of oxygen.

Butylic alcohol, a very different substance, has precisely the same composition.

We now know that in the former the atom of oxygen is in the middle of a

chain of carbon atoms, whereas in the latter it is at one end of that chain.

You might fancy it impossible to decide upon any thing like consistent evi-

dence such questions as this ; but I can assure you that the atomic theory,

as now used by chemist?, leads frequently to conclusions of this kind, which

are confirmed by independent observers, and command general assent. That

these conclusions are, as far as they go, true descriptions of natural phe-

nomena is shown by the fact that each of them serves in its turn as a step-

ping-stone to further discoveries.

One other extension of our knowledge of atoms I must briefly mention,

one which has as yet received but little attention, yet which wiU, I venture

to think, be found serviceable in the study of the forces which bring about

chemical change.

The original view of the constitution of molecules was statical ; and che-

mists only took cognizance of those changes of place among their atoms which

result in the disappearance of the moleci;les employed, and the appearance of

new molecules formed by their reaction on one another. Thus, when a
solution of common salt (sodic chloride) is mixed with a solution of silver

nitrate, it is well known that the metallic atoms in these respective com-

pounds change places with one another, forming silver chloride and sodic

nitrate                            for the  silver chloride soon settles  to the  bottom of  the solution  in
                                ;

the form of an insoluble powder, while the other product remains dissolved

in the liquid. But as long as the solution of salt remained undecomposed,

Aeach little molecule in it was supposed to be chemically at rest.                           parti-

cular atom of sodium which was combined with an atom of chlorine was sup-

posed to remain steadily fixed to it. When this inactive solution was mixed

with the similarly inactive solution of silver nitrate, the interchange of atoms

known to take place between their respective molecules was nominally ex-

plained by the force of predisposing affinity. It was, in fact, supposed that

the properties of the new compounds existed and produced effects before the

compounds themselves had been formed.

   I had occasion to point out a good many years ago that molecules which
appear to be chemically at rest are reacting on one another when in suitable

--conditions, in the same kind of way as those which are manifestly in a state

of chemical change that, for instance, the molecules of liquid sodic chloride

exchange sodium atoms with one another, forming new molecules of the same
                                                                                                     --

                                                          ADDllESS.                                        IxXV

compound undistinguishable from the first, so that, in an aggregate of like

molecules, the apparent atomic rest is the result of the interchange of like

atoms between contiguous molecules.

Such exchanges of atoms take place not only between molecules of iden-

tical composition, but also between contiguous molecules containing different

elements. For instance, in a mixture of sodic chloride and potassic iodide

an interchange of metallic atoms takes place, forming potassic chloride and

sodic iodide. The result of the exchange in such a case is to form a couple

of new molecules diff^erent from the original couple. But these products are

subject to the same general law of atomic exchanges, and their action on one

another reproduces a couple of molecules of the materials.

Thus a liquid mixture formed from two compounds, contains molecules of

four kinds, which we may describe as the two materials and the two products*.

The materials are reacting ou one another, forming the products ; and these

products are, in their turn, reacting on one another, reproducing the materials.

If one of the products of atomic exchange between two molecules is a solid

while the otlier remains liquid (as when sodic chloride is mixed with silver

nitrate), or if one is gaseous while the other remains liquid, so that the

molecules of the one kind cannot react on those of the other kind and re-

produce the materials, then the continued reaction of the materials on one

another leads to their complete mutual decomposition. Such complete mu-

tual decomposition of two salts takes place whenever they react on one

another under such conditions that the products cannot react on one another

and reproduce the materials; whereas partial decomposition takes place

whenever the materials form a homogeneous mixture with the products.

Now, if in any such homogeneous mixture more exchanges of atoms take

place between the materials than between the products, the number of mole-

cules of the products is increased, because more of them are being made than

unmade                                               and  reciprocally, if more exchanges of  atoms  take  place between
                                                  ;

the products than between the materials, the number of molecules of the

materials is increased. The mixture remains of constant composition when

there are in the unit of time as many decomposing changes as reproducing

changes.

Suppose that we were to determine by experiment the proportion between

the number of molecules of the materials, and the number of molecules of

the products, in a mixture the composition of which remains constant, and

that we found, for instance, twice as many of materials as of products ; what
would this mean ? Why, if every two couples of materials only effiect in the
unit of time as many exchanges as every one couple of products, every couple

of materials is only exchanging half as fast as every couple of products.

In fact you perceive that a determination of the proportion in which the

substances are present in such a mixture will give us a measure of the rela-

--tive velocities of those particular atomic motions ; and we may thus express

our result : The force of chemical combination is inversely proportional to

the number of atomic interchanges.

I cannot quit this part of our subject without alluding to the fact that

some few chemists of such eminence as to be entitled to the most respectful

attention, have of late years expressed an opinion that the idea of atoms is

not necessary for the explanation of the changes in the chemical constitution

of matter, and have sought as far as possible to exclude from their language

an}r allusion to atoms.

It would be out of place on this occasion to enter into any discussion of

the questions thus raised ; but I think it right to point out :
                                                                                                --

Ixxvi                                                                           --REPORT 1873.

I. That these objectors have not shown us any inconsistency in the atomic

theory, nor in the conclusions to Avhich it leads.

II. That neither these nor any other philosophers have been able to ex-

plain the facts of ehemistr}^ on the assumption that there are no atoms, but

that matter is infinitely divisible.

III. That when they interpret their analyses, these chemists allow them-

selves neither more nor less latitude than the Atomic Theory allows ; in fact

they are unconsciously guided by it.

These facts need no comment from me.

Our science grows by the acquisition of new facts which have an intel-

ligible place among our ideas of the order of nature ; but in proportion as

more and more facts are arranged before us in their natural order, in pro-

portion as our view of the order of nature becomes clearer and broader, we

are able to observe and describe that order more fullj' and more accurately

in fact, to improve our ideas of the order of nature. These more extensive

and more accurate ideas suggest new observations, and lead to the discovery

of truths which would have found no place in the narrower and less accurate

sj'^stem. Take away from Chemistry the ideas which connect and explain

the multifarious facts observed, and it is no longer a science ; it is nothing
more than a confused and useless heap of materials.

The answer to our question respecting the meaning of the earnest work

which is going on in our science must, I think, now be plain to you.

Chemists are examining the combining-properties of atoms, and getting clear

ideas of the constitution of matter.

   Admitting, then, for the present, that such is the meaning of chemical

work, we have to consider the more important question of its use ; and I
think you will agree with me that, in order to judge soundly whether and in
what manner such a pursuit is useful, we have to consider its effect upon
Man. What habits of mind does it engender ? What powers does it de-

velope ? Does it develope good and noble qualities and aspirations, and tend

to make men more able and more anxious to do good to their felloAV men ?
Or is it a mere idle amusement, bearing no permanent fruits of improvement ?

   You wiU, I think, answer these questions yourselves if I can succeed in

describing to you some of the chief qualities which experience has shown to

be requisite for the successful pursuit of Chemistry, and which are neces-

sarily cultivated by those who qualify themselves for such a career.
   One of the first requirements on the part of an investigator is accuracy in

observing the phenomena with which he deals. He must not only see the

precise particulars of a process as they present themselves to his observation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

he must also observe the order in which these particular appearances present

themselves under the conditions of each experiment. No less essential is

accuracy of memory. An experimental inquirer must remember accurately

a number of facts                                                               and he needs to remember their mutual relations, so that
                                                                             ;

one of them when present to his mind may recall those others which ought

to be considered with it. In fact he cultivates the habit of remembering

facts mainly by their place in nature. Accuracy in manual operations is

required in all experimental inquiries ; and many of them aiford scope for

very considerable skill and dexterity.

   These elementary qualities are well known to be requisite for success in

experimental science, and to be developed by careful practice of its methods
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

but some higher qualities are quite as necessary as these in all but the most

rudimentary manipulations, and are developed in a remarkabl* degree by the
higher work of science.

Thus it is of importance to notice that a singularly good training in the

accurate use of words is afforded by experimental Chemistry. Every one

who is about to enter on an inquiry, whether he be a first-year's student

who wants to find the constituents of a common salt, or whether he be the

most skilled and experienced of Chemists, seeks beforehand to get such in-

formation from the records of previous observations as may be most useful

for his purpose. This information he obtains through the medium of words ;
and any failure on his part to understand the precise meaning of the words
conveying the information requisite for his guidance is liable to lead him

astray. Those elementary exercises in analytical chemistry, in which brief

directions to the students alternate with their experiments and their reports

of experiments made and conclusions drawn, afford a singularly effective

training in the habit of attending accurately to the meaning of words used

by others, and of selecting words capable of conveying without ambiguity

the precise meaning intended. Any inaccuracy in the student's apprehension

of the directions given, or in the selection of words to describe his obser-

vations and conclusions, is at once detected, when the result to which he
ought to have arrived is known beforehand to the teacher.

Accuracy of reasoning is no less effectively promoted by the work of ex-

perimental chemistry. It is no small facility to ns that the meaning of the

words which we use to denote properties of matter and operations can be

learnt by actual observation. Moreover each proposition comprised in che-

mical reasonings conveys some distinct statement susceptible of verification

by similar means ; and the validity of each conclusion can be tested, not only

by examining whether or not it follows of necessity from true premisses,

but also by subjecting it to the independent test of special experiment.

Chemists have frequent occasion to employ arguments which indicate a

probability of some truth ; and the anticipations based upon them serve as

guides to experimental inquiry by suggesting crucial tests. But they distin-

guish most caroiuUy such hypotheses from demonstrated facts.

Thus a pale green solution, stated to contain a pure metallic salt, is found

to possess some properties which belong to Salts of Iron. ]!^othing else pos-

sesses these properties except Salts of Nickel ; and they manifest a slight dif-

ference from Iron Salts in one of the properties observed.

The analyst could not see any appearance of that peculiarity which distin-

guishes Nickel Salts ; so he concludes that he has probably got Iron in his

solution, brt almost certainly either Iron or Nickel. He then makes an ex-

periment which will, he knows, give an entirely different result with Iron

Salts and Nickel Salts ; and he gets very distinctly the result which indicates

Iron.

Having found in the green liquid properties which the presence of Iron

could alone impart, he considers it highly probable that Iron is present. But

he does not stop there ; for, although the facts before him seem to admit of no

other interpretation, he knows that, from insufficient knowledge or attention,

mistakes are sometimes made in very simple matters. The analyst therefore

tries as many other experiments as are known to distinguish Iron Salts from

all others ; and if any one of these leads distinctly to a result at variance
with his provisional conclusion, he goes over the whole inquiry again, in

order to find where his mistake was. Such inquiries are practised largely by
students of chemistry, in order to fix in their minds, by frequent use, a know-
ledge of the fundamental properties of the common elements, in order to

learn by practice the art of making experiments, and, above all, in order to

acquire the habit of judging accurately of evidence in natural phenomena.

Such a student is often surprised at being told that it is not enough for him to

conduct his experiments to such a point that every conclusion except one is

--contrary to the evidence before him- that he must then try every confirma-

tory test which he can of the substance believed to be present, and ascertain

that the sample in his hands agrees, as far as ho can see, in all properties

Avith the known substance of which he believes it to be a specimen.

Those who tread the path of original inquiry, and add to human know-

ledge by their experiments, are bound to practise this habit Avith the most

scrupulous fidelity and care, or many and grave would be the mistakes they

would make.

   Thus a Chemist thinks it probable that he might prepare some well-known

organic body of the aromatic family by a new process. He sets to work and

obtains a substance agreeing in appearance, in empirical composition, in

molecular weight, and in many other properties with the compound which

he had in view. He is, however, not satisfied that his product is a sample

of that compound until he has examined carefully whether it possesses all

the properties which are known to belong to the substance in question. And
many a time is his caution rewarded by the discovery of some distinct dif-

ference of melting-point, or of crystalline form, &c., which jn-ovcs that he

has made a new compound isomeric with the one which he expected to make.

It seemed probable, from the agreement of the two substances in many

particulars, that they might be found to agree in all, and might be considered

to be the same compound ; but complete proof of that conclusion consists iu
showing that the new substance agrees with all that we know of the old one.

In the most vai'ious ways chemists seek to extend their knowledge of tbe

uniformity of nature ; and their reasonings by analogy from particulars to

particulars suggest the working hypotheses M'hich lead to new observations.

Before, however, proceeding to test the trutli of his hypothesis by experi-

ment, the chemist passes in review, as well as he can, all the general know-

ledge which has any bearing on it, in order to find agreement or disagree-
ment between his hypothesis and the ideas estabhshed by past experience.

Sometimes he sees that his hypothesis is at variance with some general law

in which he has full confidence, aud he throws it aside as disproved by that

law. On other occasions he finds that it follows of necessity from some

known law                                                  and  he  then  proceeds to verify it  by experiment, with  a confident
                                                        ;

anticipation of the result. In many cases the hypothesis does not present

sufficiently distinct agreement or disagreement with the ideas established by

previoiis investigations to justify either the rejection of it or a confident
belief in its truth; for it often happens that the results of experience of

similar phenomena are not embodied in a sufficiently definite or trustworthy
statement to have any other effect than that of giving probability or the

contrary to the hypothesis.

Another habit of mind which is indispensable for success in experimental

chemistry, and which is taught by the practice of its various operations, is

that of truthfulness.

   The very object of all our endeavours is to get true ideas of the natural

processes of chemical action ; for in proportion as our ideas are true do they
give us the power of directing these in'ocesses. In fact our ideas are useful
only so far as they are true ; and he must indeed be blind to interest and to

duty who could wish to swerve from the path of truth. But if any one were
weak enough to make the attempt, he would find his way barred by innu-

merable obstacles.

Every addition to our science is a matter of immediate interest and im-

portance to those who are working in the same direction. They verify in

various ways the statements of the first discoverer, and seldom fail to uoticc
further particulars, and to correct any little errors of detail into which he

may have fallen. They soon make it a stepping-stone to further disco-
veries. Any thing like wilful misrepresentation is inevitably detected and
made known.

   It must not, however, he supposed that the investigator drifts imcon-
sciously into the habit of truthfulness for want of temptation to be un-
truthful, or even that error presents itself to his mind in a grotesque and
repulsive garb, so as to enlist from the iirst his feelings against it j for I
can assure you that the precise contrary of these things happens. Error
comes before him usually in the very garb of truth ; and his utmost skill
and attention are needed to decide whether or not it is entitled to retain that

garb.

   You will easily see how this happens if you reflect that each working

hypothesis employed by an investigator is an uuproven proposition, which

bears such resemblance to truth as to give rise to hopes that it may really be
true. The investigator trusts it provisionally to tlie extent of trying one or
more experiments, of which it claims to predict the specific result. Even
though it guide him correctly for a while, he considers it still on trial until

it has been tested by every process which ingenuity can suggest for the pur-

pose of detecting a fault.

    Most errors which an experimentalist has to do with are really imperfect
truths, which have done good service in their time by guiding the course of
discovery. The great object of scientific work is to replace these imper-
fect truths by more exact and comprehensive statements of the order of

nature.

    Whoever has once got knowledge from nature herself by truthful reason-
ing and experiment, must be dull indeed if he does not feel that he has ac-
quired a new and noble power, and if he does not long to exercise it further,
and make new conquests from the realm of darkness by the aid of known

truths.

   The habit of systematically searching for truth by the aid of known truths,
and of testing the validity of each step by constant reference to nature, has
now been practised for a sufficiently long time to enable us to judge of some

of its results.

    Every true idea of the order of nature is an instrument of thought. It
can only be obtained by truthful investigation ; and it can only be used effec-
tively in obedience to the same laws. But the first idea which is formed of
any thing occurring in nature affords only a partial representation of the
actual reality, by recording what is seen of it from a particular point of view.

By examining a thing from different points of view we get different ideas of
it ; and when we compare these ideas accurately with one another, recollect-
ing how each one was obtained, we find that they really supplement each

other.

   We try to form in our minds a distinct image of a thing capable of pro-

ducing these various appearances ; and when we have succeeded in doing so,
we look at it from the different points of view from which the natural object
 had been examined, and find that the ideas so obtained meet at the central

 image. It usually happens that an accurate examination of the mutual
 bearings of these ideas on the central image suggests additions to them, and
 correction of some particulars in them.

    Thus it is that true ideas of a natural phenomenon confirm and strengthen

                                                                                                                r/2

one another; and he who aids directly the development of one o them is sure

to promote indirectly the consolidation of others.

   Each onward step in the search for truth has made us stronger for the
work ; and when we look back upon what has been done by the efforts of so
many workers simply but steadily directed by truth towards further truth,
we see that they have achieved, for the benefit of the human race, the con-
quest of a systematic body of truths which encourages men to similar efforts
while affording them the most effectual aid and guidance.

    This lesson of the inherent vitality of truth, which is taught us so clearly
by the history of our science, is well worthy of the consideration of those who,
seeing that iniquity and falsehood so frequently triumph for a while in the

struggle for existence, are inclined to take a desponding view of human affairs,

and almost to despair of the ultimate predominance of truth and goodness.
I beheve it would be impossible at the present time to form an adequate
idea of the vast consequences which will follow from the national adop-
tion of systematic measures for allowing our knowledge of truth to develope

itself freely, through the labours of those who are wUling and able to devote
themselves to its service, so as to strengthen more and more the belief and

trust of mankind in its guidance, in small matters as Avell as in the highest

and most important considerations.

   T am desirous of describing briefly the more important of those measures
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

--but first let me mention another habit of mind which naturally follows from

the effective pursuit of truth, a habit which might be described in general

terms as the application to other matters of the truthfulness imparted by

 science.

    The words which the great German poet put into the mouth of Mephisto-
pheles when describing himself to Faust, afford perhaps the most concise and
forcible statement of what we may call the anti-scientific spirit :

                                        ,, Icli bin der Geist der stets verneint,

                             Dem alles, was entsteht, zuwider 1st."

 The true spirit of science is certainlj' affirmative, not negative ; for, as I men-
 tioned just now, its history teaches us that the development of our knowledge
 usually takes place through two or more simultaneous ideas of the same phe-
 nomenon, quite different from one another, both of which ultimately prove to
 be parts of some more general truth ; so that a confident belief in one of those

 ideas docs not involve or justify a denial of the others.

    I could give you many remarkable illustrations of this law from among
 ideas familiar to Chemists. But I want you to consider with me its bearing
 on the habit of mind called toleration, of which the development in modern

 times is perhaps one of the most hopeful indications of moral improvement
 in man.

    In working at our science we simply try to find out what is true ; for
 although no usefulness is to be found at first in most of our results, we know

 well that every extension of our knowledge of truth is sure to prove useful in
 manifold ways. So regular an attendant is usefulness upon truth in our

 work, that wc get accustomed to expect them always to go together, and to
 believe that there must be some amount of truth wherever there is manifest

 usefulness.

     The history of human ideas, so far as it is written in the records of the
 progress of science, abounds with instances of men contributing powerfully to
 the development of important general ideas, by their accurate and conscien-

 tious experiments, while at the same time professing an actual disbelief in
                                       ;

                             ADDRESS.  Ixxxi

those ideas. Those records must indeed have been a dead letter to any one
who could stand carping at the intellectual crotchets of a good and honest
worker, instead of giving him all brotherly help in furtherance of his work.

   To one who knows the particulars of our science thoroughly, and who knows
also what a variety of ideas have been resorted to in working oiit the whole

body of truths of which the science is composed, there are few more impressive
and elevating subjects of contemplation than the unity in the clear and bold

outline of that noble structure.

   I hope that you will not suppose, from my references to Chemistry as pro-

moting the development of these habits and powers of mind, that I wish to

claim for that particular branch of science any exclusive merit of the kind

for I can assure you that nothing can be further from my intention.
   I conceived that you would wish me to speak of that department of science

which I have had occasion to study more particularly ; but much that I have
said of it might be said with equal truth of other studies, while some of its
merits may be claimed in a higher degree by other branches of science. On

the other hand, those highest lessons which I have illustrated by chemistry
are best learnt by those whose intellectual horizon includes other provinces of

knowledge.

    Chemistry presents peculiar advantages for educational purposes in the
combination of breadth and accuracy in the training which it affords ; and I

am inclined to think that in this respect it is at present unequalled. There is

reason to believe that it will play an important part in general education, and
render valuable services to it in conjunction with other scientific and with

literary studies.

I trust that the facts which I have submitted to your consideration may

suffice to show you how fallacious is that materialistic idea of Physical Science

which represents it as leading away from the study of man's noblest faculties,

and from a sympathy with his most elevated aspirations, towards mere inani-

mate matter. The material work of science is directed by ideas towards the

attainment of further ideas. Each step in science is an addition to our ideas,

Aor an improvement of them.  science is but a body of ideas respecting the

order of nature.

   Each idea which forms part of Physical Science has been derived from ob-
servation of nature, and has been tested again and again in the most various
ways by reference to nature ; but this very soundness of our materials
enables us to raise upon the rock of truth a loftier structure of ideas
than could be erected on any other foundation by the aid of uncertain ma-

terials.

   The study of science is the stiidy of man's most accurate and perfect intel-

lectual labours ; and he who would know the powers of the human mind

must go to science for his materials.
   Like other powers of the mind, the imagination is powerfully exercised,

and at the same time disciplined, by scientific work. Every investigator has
frequent occasion to call forth in his mind a distinct image of something in
nature which could produce the appearances which he witnesses, or to frame
a proposition embodying some observed relation ; and in each case the image
or the proposition is required to be true to the materials from which it is
formed. There is perhaps no more perfect elementary illustration of the ac-
curate and useful employment of the imagination than the process of forming
in the language of symbols, from concrete data, one of these admirable
general propositions called equations ; on the other hand, the contemplation
of the order and harmony of nature as disclosed to us by science supplies the
Ixxxii  --REPOKT 1873.

imagination with materials of surpassing grandeur and brilliancy, while at

the same time affording the widest scope for its efforts.

    The foregoing considerations respecting the meaning and use of scientific

work wiU, I trust, afford us aid in considering what measures ought to be
taken in order to promote its advancement, and what we can do to further

the adoption of such measures.

    Like any other natural phenomenon, the growth of knowledge in the

human mind is favoured and promoted by certain circumstances, impeded or

arrested by others ; and it is for us to ascertain from experience what those
circumstances respectively are, and how the favourable ones can be best com-

bined to the exclusion of the others.

    The best and noblest things in this world are the result of gradual growth,

by the free action of natural forces ; and the proper function of legislation is

to systematize the conditions most favourable to the free action which is

 desired.

    I shall consider the words " Advancement of Science " as referring to the

develoijment and extension of our systematic knowledge of natural phenomena
by investigation and research.

    The first thing wanted for the work of advancing science is a supply of
well-qualified workers. The second thing is to place and keep them under
the conditions most favourable to their efficient activity. The most suitable

men must be found while still young, and trained to the work. Now I know

only one reaUy effectual way of finding the youths who are best endowed by

nature for the purpose ; and that is to systematize and develope the natural
conditions which accidentally concur in particular cases, and enable youths to
rise from the crowd.

   The first of these is that a young man gets a desire for knowledge by seeing
the value and beauty of some which ho has acquired. When he has got this

desire, he exerts himself to increase his store ; and every difficulty surmounted
increases his love of the pursuit, and strengthens his determination to go on.
His exertions are seen by some more experienced man, wlio helps him to

place himself under circumstances favourable to further progress. He then

has op]5ortunities of seeing original inquiries conducted, perhaps even of aid-

ing in them ; and he longs to prove that he also can work out new truths, and
make some permanent addition to human knowledge. If his circumstances
enable him to prosecute such work, and he succeeds in making some new ob-
servations worthy of publication, he is at once known by them to the com-
munity of scientific men, and employed among them.

   We want, then, a system which shall give to the young favourable oppor-

tunities of acquiring a clear and, as far as it goes, a thorough knowledge of

--some few truths of nature such as they can understand and enjoy ^ which shall

afford opportunity of further and further instruction to those who have best

--profited by that which has been given to them, and are anxious to obtain

more which shall enable the best students to see what original investigation

--is, and, if possible, to assist in carrying out some research and, finally,

which shall supply to each student who has tlie power and the will to

conduct researches, all material conditions which are requisite for the

j)urpose.

   But investigators, once found, ought to be placed in the circumstances most

favourable to their efficient activity.

   The first and most fundamental condition for this is, that their desire for
the acquidtion of knowledge be kept alive and fostered. Tlioy must not
merely retain the hold which they have acquired on the general body of their
          ;

ADDRESS.  Ixxxiii

 science ; they ought to strengthen and extend that hold, by acquiring a more
 complete and accurate knowledge of its doctrines and methods ; in a word,
 they ought to be more thorough students than during their state of preli-
 minary training.

    They must bo able to live by their work, without diverting any of their
 energies to other pursuits ; and they must feel security against want, in the

 event of illness or in their old age.

    They must be supplied with intelligent and trained assistants to aid in
the conduct of their researches, and whatever buildings, apparatus, and ma-
terials may be required for conducting those researches effectively.

    The desired system must therefore provide arrangements favourable to the

maintenance and development of the true student-spirit in investigators,
while providing them with permanent means of subsistence, sufficient to
enable them to feel secure and tranquil in working at science alone, yet not
sufficient to neutralize their motives for exertion ; and at the same time it
must give them all external aids, in proportion to their wants and powers of
making good use of them.

   Now I propose to describe the outline of such a system, framed for the

sole purpose of promoting research, and then to consider what other results
would follow from its working.

    If it should appear possible to establish a system for the efficient advance-

ment of science, which would be productive of direct good to the community

in other important ways, I think you will agree with me that we ought to do
all that we can to promote its adoption.

    Let the most intelligent and studious children from every primary school
be sent, free of expense, to the most accessible secondary school for one year

let the best of these be selected and allowed to continue for a second year,
and so oji, until the elite of them have learnt all that is to be there learnt to
advantage. Let the best pupils from the secondary schools be sent to a col-

lege of their own selection, and there subjected to a similar process of annual
weeding ; and, finally, let those who get satisfactorily to the end of a college

curriculum be supplied with an allowance sufficient for their maintenance for

a year, on condition of their devoting their undivided energies to research,
under the inspection of competent college authorities, while allowed such aids
and facilities as the college can supply, with the addition of money-grants for

special purposes. Let aU who do well during this first year be allowed similar

advantages for a second, and even a third year.
   Each young investigator thus trained must exert himself to obtain some

apjM)intment, which may enable him to do the most useful and creditable work

of which he is capable, while combining the conditions most favourable to his

own improvement.

    Let there be in every college as manj' Professorships and Assistantships in
each branch of science as are needed for the efficient conduct of the work
there going on, and let every Professor and Assistant have such salary and

such funds for apparatus &c. as may enable him to devote all his powers to

the duties of his post, under conditions favourable to the success of those
duties ; but let each Professor receive also a proportion of the fees paid by his

pupils, so that it may be his direct interest to do his work with the utmost

attainable efficiency, and attract more pupils.
    Let every college and school be governed by an independent body of men,

striving to increase its usefulness and reputation, by sympathy with the
labours of the working staff, by material aid to them when needed, and by

getting the very best man they can, from their own or any other college, to

supply each vacancy as it arises.
        --;

Ixxxiv  --REPORT 1873.

    Ill addition to colleges, ·whicli are and always have been the chief institu-

tions for the advancement of learning, establishments for the observation of

special phenomena are frequently needed, and will doubtless be found de-

sirable in aid of a general system for the advancement of science.

    Now, if a system fulfilling the conditions which I have thus briefly sketched

out were once properly established on a sufficient scale, it ought to develop

and improve itself by the very process of its working ; and it behoves us, in

judging of the sj'stem, to consider how such development and improvement

would come about.

    The thing most needed at the present time for the advancement of science

is a supply of teachers devoted to that object--men so earnestly striving for

more knowledge and better knowledge as to be model students, stimulating

and encouraging those around them by their example as much as by their
teaching. Young men do not prepare themselves in any numbers for such a

career :

    I. Because the chief influences which surround them at school and at

college are not calculated to awaken in them a desire to obtain excellence of

such kind.

    II. Because they could not expect by means of such qualities to reach a
l)osition which would afford a competent subsistence.

    Let these conditions be reversed, to the extent that existing teachers have

powerful inducements to make their students love the study of science for
its own sake, with just confidence that they will be able to earn a livelihood

if they succeed in qualifying themselves to advance science, and the whole
thing is changed. The first batch of young investigators will be dispersed
among schools and colleges according to their powers and acquirements, and
will at once improve their influence upon the pupils, and enable them to
send up a second batch better trained than the first. This improvement will
go on increasing, if the natural forces which promote it are allowed free play
and the youth of each successive generation will have better and more fre-
quent oj)portunities of awakening to a love of learning, better help and
guidance in their efforts to acquire and use the glorious inheritance of know-
ledge which had been left them, better and more numerous living examples

of men devoting their whole lives to the extension of the domain of truth,

and seeking their highest reward in the consciousuess that their exertions
have benefited their fellow men, and are appreciated by them.

  A young man who is duly qualified for the work of teaching the investi-

gation of some particular branch of science, and who wishes to devote him-
self to it, will become a member of an association of men selected for their
known devotion to learning, and for their ability to teach the methods of
investigation in their respective subjects. Around this central group is
arranged a frequently changing body of youths, who trust to them for en-

couragement and guidance in their respective studies.

    Our young investigator finds it necessary to study again more carefully
many parts of his subject, and to examine accurately the evidence of various

conclusions which he had formerly adopted, in order that he may be able to

lead the minds of his pupils by easy and natural yet secure steps to the dis-

covery of the general truths which are within their reach. He goes over his

branch of science again and again from the foundation upwards, striving
each time to present its essential particulars more clearly and more forcibly,
arranging them in the order best calculated to stimulate an inquiring mind
to reflect upon their meaning, and to direct its efforts effectively lo the dis-

covery of the general ideas which are to be derived from them. He is en-
ADDRESS.  IXXXV

couragcd in these cflforts by the sympathy of his colleagues, and often aided
by suggestions derived from their experience in teaching other branches of
science, or by information respecting doctrines or methods which throw a

light upon those of his own subject.
   No known conditions are so well calculated to give a young investigator

the closest and strongest grasp of his subject of which he is capable as those
in which he is placed while thus earnestly teaching it in a college ; and in-

asmiieh as a thorough mastery of known truths is needed by every one who
would work to advantage at the discovery of new truths of that kind, it will,

in most cases, be an object of ambition to the ablest young investigators to
get an opportunity of going through the work of teaching in a college, in
order to improve themselves to the utmost for the work of original research.
There is, however, another advantage to them in having such work to do;

for the best way to ascertain at any one time what additions may be made

to a science, is to examine the facts which have been discovered last, and to

consider how far they confirm and extend the established ideas of the science,
how far they militate against those ideas. An investigating teacher is con-
stantly weaving new facts into the bodj^ of his science, and forming antici-
pations of new truths by considering the relation of these new facts to the

old ones.

   "When our investigator has thus got a thoroiigh mastery of his science and

new ideas for its extension, he ought to have the opportimity of turning his
improved powers to account by devoting more of his time to original research

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

in fact he ought to teach research by example more than hitherto, and less by
elementary exercises upon known facts. If he has discharged the duties of
his first post with manifest efliciency, he will be promoted, either in his own
or some other college, to a chair affording more leisure and facility for
original research by his own hands and by those of his assistants and pupils.

Some investigators may find it desirable to give up after a while all teaching

of previously published truths, and confine themselves to guiding the original
researches of advanced pupils, while stimulating them by the example of

their own discoveries. But most of them wiU probably prefer to do elemen-
tary teaching work from time to time, for the sake of the opportunity of
going over the groundwork of their science, with a knowledge of the new

facts and enlarged ideas recently established.

   Now it must be observed that such a system as the above, once developed
to its proper proportions, so as to send annually to secondary schools many

thousands of poor children who would otherwise never enjoy such advantages,

and so as to train to original investigation a corresponding proportion of
them, would not only provide more young investigators than would be needed
for systematic teaching functions, but would also give a partial training of the

same kind to many whose abilities proved to be insufficient, or whose tastes
were not congenial to such pursuit. Some would be tempted by an advan-

tageous opening in an industrial pursuit or in the public service to break ojff
their studies before completion, and others would find, after completing their
training, a position of that kind more desirable or more attainable than a

purely scientific appointment. Not only would much good of other kinds be
accomplished by this circumstance, but we may say with confidence that
the system could not work with full advantage for its own special purpose of

promoting the advancement of science if it did not diffuse a knowledge of
the truths and methods of science beyond the ciixle of teachers.

    There is an urgent need of accurate scientific knowledge for the direction

of manufacturing processes, and there could not be a greater mistake than to
IxXXvi  --REPORT 1873.

suppose tliat such knowledge need not go beyond tlie elementary truths of
science. In every branch of manufacture improvements are made from time

to time, by the introduction of new or modified processes which had been
discovered by means of investigations as arduous as those conducted for

purely scientific purposes, and involving as great powers and accomplish-

ments on the part of those who conducted them.
   Any manufacturer of the present day who does not make efficient arrange-

ments for gradually perfecting and improving his processes ought to make
at once enough money to retire ; for so many are moving onwards in this
and other countries, that he would soon be left behind.

    It would be well worth while to establish such a system of scientific educa-

tion for the sake of training men to the habits of mind which are required

for the improvement of the manufacturing arts ; and I have no doubt that
the espensc of Avorking tlie system would be repaid a hundred times over by
the increase of wealth of the community ; but I only mention this as a

secondarjr advantage of national education.

  A system of the kind could not expand to due dimensions, nor could it,

once fully established, maintain itself in full activity, without intelligent
sj'mpathy from the community ; and accordingly its more active-minded
members must be taught some good examples of the processes and results of

scientific inquiry, before they can be expected to take much interest in the
results achieved by inquirei's, and to do their share of the work requisite for tlie

success of the system, I need hardly remind you that there are plenty of other

strong reasons why some such knowledge of the truths of nature, and of the

means by which they are found out, should be difi^used as widely as possible

throughout the community.

   You perceive that in such educational system each teacher must trust to
his own exertions for success and advancement ; and he wiU do so if he is
sure that his results will be kno^m and compared impartially with those
attained by others. Each governing body must duly maintain the efficiency

of their school or college, if its siipport depend in some degree on the evi-
dences of that efficiency ; and they will try to improve their school if they

know that every imx^rovement will be seen and duly appreciated.
   The keystone of the whole structure is the action of the State in distri-

buting funds carefully among schools and colleges proportionally to the evi-
dence of their doing good work, which could not be continued without

such aid.

   I am inclined to think that the State ought, as far as possible, to confine

its educational grants to the purpose of maintaining and continuing good
work which is actually being done, and rarely if ever to initiate educational

experiments : first, because it is desirable to encourage private exertions

and donations for the establishment of schools and colleges upon new
systems, or in new localities, by giving the public fuU assui'ance that if any
new institution establishes its right to existence, by doing good work for a
while, it will not be allowed to die off for want of support ; and, secondly,

because the judicial impartiality required in the administration of public
funds, on the basis of results of work, is hardly compatible with an advocacy

of any particular means of attaining such results.

   On the other hand, experience has shown that special endowments, which tie
up funds in perpetuity for a definite pm'pose, commonly fail to attain their

object under the altered circumstances which spring up in later generations,
and not unfrequently detract from the efficiency of the institutions to which
they are attached, by being used for objects other than those which it is their

proper function to promote.

ADDRESS.  IxXXvii

    "When there is felt to be a real want of any new institution for the promo-
tion of learning, men are usually wUling enough to devote time and money

 to the purpose of establishing it and giving it a fair trial. It is desirable

 that they should leave the State to judge of their experiment by its results,

and to maintain it or not, according to the evidences of its usefulness. No
institution ought, for its own sake, to have such permanent endowments as

might deprive its members of motives for exertion.
    The State could not, however, discharge these judicial functions without

accurate and trustworthy evidence of the educational work done at the various
schools and of its success. Por this purpose a record must be kept by or
under the direction of every teacher of the weekly progress of each pupU,
showing what he has done and how he has done it. Official inspectors would
have to see to these records being kept upon a uniform scale, so that their
results might be comparable. The habit of keeping such records conduces
powerfully to the efficiency of teachers ; and, for the sake of the due develop-
ment of the teaching system, it ought to prevail generally. Having such full
and accui'ate means of knowing what opportunities of improvement jrapils
have enjoyed and what use they have made of those opportunities, Govern-
ment ought to stimulate their exertions and test their progress by periodical
examinations. It is of the utmost importance to allow any new and improved
system of instruction to develope itself freely, by the exertions of those who
are willing to undertake the labour and risk of trying it on a practical scale
and the pupils who acquire upon sivAi new system a command of any branch
of science, ought to have a fair opportunity of showing what they have

achieved and how they have achieved it. An able and impartial examiner,
knowing the new systems in use, will encourage each candidate to work out

his results in the manner in which he has been taught to work out results

of the kind.

    Examinations thus impartiallj'^ conducted with a view of testing the suc-
cess of teachers iu the work which they are endeavouring to do, have a far
higher value, and consequent authority, than those which are conducted in
ignorance or disregard of the process of training to which the candidates have

been subjected ; and we may safely say that the examination system will not

attain its full usefulness until it is thus worked in intimate connexion with a
system of teaching.

    In order to give every one employed in the educational system the utmost
interest in maintaining and increasing his efficiency, it is essential that a
due measure of publicity be given to the chief results of their respective
labours. Schools and colleges ought, to a considerable extent, to be supported
b)' the fees paid by pupUs for the instruction received ; and every Professor
being in part dependent upon the fees of his pupils Avill have a direct interest
in attracting more pupils to his classes or laboratories. The fame of important

original investigations of his own or his pupils, published in the scientific
journals, is one of the natural means by which a distinguished Professor

attracts disciples, and the success of his pupils in after life is another. His
prospects of promotion will depend mainly on the opinion formed of his
powers from such materials as these by the governing bodies of colleges and
bj- the public ; for if each college is dependent for success upon the efficiency
of its teaching staff, its governing body must do their best to till up every
vacancy as it arises by the ajipointment of the ablest and most successful

Professor whom they can get ; and any college which does not succeed in
obtaining the services of able men will soon lose reputation, and fall off in

numbers.
Ixxxviii  --KEPORT 1873.

There are, however, further advantages to the working of the system to

be derived from full publicity of aU its more important proceedings. It will

supply materials for the formation of a sound public opinion respecting the

Aproceedings of the authorities in their various spheres of action.                                                                                         claim for

money might be made upon Government by the rulers of some college iipon

inadequate grounds ; or a just and proper claim of the kind might be disre-
garded by Government. Neither of these things wiU be likely to happen

very often if the aj^plications, together with the evidence bearing on them,

are open to public scrutiny and criticism ; and when they do occasionally

happen, there will be a natural remedy for them.

If I have succeeded in making clear to you the leading principles of the

plan to be adopted for the advancement of science, including, as it necessa-

rily must do, national education generally, you will, I think, agree with me

that, from the very magnitude and variety of the interests involved in its

action, such system must of necessity be under the supreme control of

Government. Science wiU never take its proper place among the chief ele-

ments of national greatness and advancement until it is acknowledged as such

by that embodiment of the national wUl which we call the Government. Nor

can the various institutions for its advancement develope duly their useful-

ness until the chaos in which they are now plunged gives place to such order

as it is the proper function of Government to establish and maintain.

But Government has already taken, and is continuing to take, action in

various matters affecting elementaiy popular education and higher scientific

education, and it would be difficult to arrest such action, even if it were

thought desirable to do so. The onlj' practical ^question to be considered is

how the action of Government can be systematized so as to give fi'ee plaj' to

the natural forces which have to do the work.

By establishing official examinations for appointments and for degrees,

Government exerts a powerful influence on the teaching in schools and

colleges, without taking cognizance, except in some few cases, of the systems of

teaching which prevail in them. Again, they give grants of public money from

time to time in aid of colleges or universities, or for the establishment of a

high school under their own auspices. Sometimes they endow a Professor-

ship. In taking each measure of the kind they are doubtless influenced by

evidence that it is in itself a good thing, calculated to promote the advance-

ment of learning. But a thing which is good in itself may produce evil effects

in relation to others, or good effects incommensurate with its cost. Thus

examinations afford most valuable aid to educational work when carried on

in conjunction with earnest teachers                                                                                                              yet when  established in the absence of
                                                                                                                                               ;

a good system of education, they are liable to give rise to a one-sided train-

ing contrived with a special view of getting young men through the exami-

nations. If no properly educated young men were found for a particular de-

partment of the public service, and an examination of aU candidates for such

appointments were to be established for the purpose of improving the system

of training, candidates would consider their power of answering such ques-

tions as appeared likely to be set as the condition of their obtaining the ap-

pointments, and they svould look out for men able and willing to train them

to that particular work in as direct and effective a manner as possible. The
demand for such instruction would soon be supplied. Some teachers would

undertake to give instruction for the mere purpose of enabling candidates to
get through the examination; and by the continued habit of such work would

gradually come to look upon the examiners as malignant beings who keep

youths out of ofiice, and whose vigilance ought to be evaded by such means
ADDRESS.  Ixxxix

as experience might show to be most effective for the purpose. Once this
kind of direct examination-teaching has taken root, and is known to produce

the desired effect of getting young men through the examinations, its exist-

ence encourages the tendency on the part of the candidates to look merely to
the examination as the end and aim of their study ; and a class of teachers
is developed whose exertions are essentially antagonistic to those of the

examiners.
    There are, no doubt, teachers with a sufficiently clear apprehension of their

duty, and sufficient authority, to convince some of the candidates that the
proper object of their study should be to increase their power of usefulness
in the career for which they are preparing themselves, by thoroughly master-
ing up to a prescribed point certain branches of knowledge ; and that until
they had honestly taken the means to do this and believed they had done it
effectually, they ought not to go up for examination nor to wish to commence

their career.

    But it is desirable that all teachers be placed under such circumstances

that it may become their interest as well as their duty to cooperate to the

utmost of their powers in the object for which the examiners are working.
For this purpose their records of the work done under their guidance by each
pupil ought to be carefully inspected by the examiners before framing their
questions, and ought to be accepted as affording the chief evidence of the

respective merits of the pupils.

   This is not the place for considering how the general funds for an
effective system of national education can best be raised, nor how existing

educational endowments can best be used in aid of those funds. It is well

known that some colleges of Oxford and Cambridge are possessed of rich
endowments, and that many distinguished members of those universities are

desirous that the annual proceeds of those endowments should be distributed
upon some system better calculated to promote the advancement of learning

than that which generally prevails. Indeed we may confidently hope that,

true to their glorious traditions, those colleges will be led, by the high-
minded and enlightened counsels of their members, to rely upon improving
usefulness in the advancement of learning as the only secure and worthy

basis of their action in the use of their funds, so that they may take a
leading part in such system of national education as may be moulded out

of the present chaos.

    But the foundations of a national system of education ought to be laid
independently of the present arrangements at Oxford and Cambridge,

for we may be sure that the more progress the system makes the more

easy will become the necessary reforms in the older universities and

colleges.

    It is clearly undesirable that Government should longer delay obtaining
such full and accurate knowledge of the existing national resources for
educational purposes, and of the manner in which they are respectively

utilized, as may enable them to judge of the comparative prospects of use-

fulness presented by the various modes of distributing educational grants.

They ought to know what has been done and what is doing in the various
public educational establishments before they can judge which of them would
be likely to make the best use of a grant of public money.

   We have official authority for expecting such impartial administration of

 educational grants; and it cannot be doubted that before long due means

 will be taken to supply the preliminary conditions.

    You are no doubt aware that a lloyal Commission was appointed some
    Xe REPORT--1873.

     time ago in consequence of representations made to Government by the
     Britishi Association on this subject, and it is understood that their instruc-
     tions are so framed as to direct their particular attention to the manner in
    which Government may best distribute educational grants. The Commission
    is moreover composed of most distinguished men, and we have every reason
     to anticipate from their labours a result worthy of the nation and of the
    momentous occasion.

        In speaking of public educational establishments, I refer to those which
    by their constitution are devoted to the advancement of learning without
    pecuniary profit to their respective governing bodies. The annual expen-
     diture requisite for keeinng up a national system of popular education will
    necessarily be considerable from the first, and will become greater from year
     to year ; but once Englishmen are fully alive to the paramount importance

    of the object, and see that its attainment is within their reach, we may be

    sure that its expense will be no impediment. England would not deserve
     to reap the glorious fruits of the harvest of knowledge if she grudged the
    necessary outlay for seed and tillage, were it even ten times greater than it
    will be. It is no use attempting to establish a national system on any other
     than a truly national basis. Private and corporate funds inevitably get
     diverted from popular use, after a few generations, to the use of the influ-
    ential and rich. A. national system must steadily keep in view the improve-
    ment of the poor, and distribute public funds each year in the manner best
     calculated to give to the youths of the poorest classes full opportunities of

    improvement proportional to their capacities, so that they may qualify them-

    selves for the utmost usefulness to their country of which they are capable,
   " The best possible security for the proper administration of the system will
     be found in the full and speedy publicity of all the particulars of its

     working.
         It has been frequently remarked that a great proportion of English in-

    vestigators are men of independent means, who not only seek no advance-

    ment as a reward of their labours, but often sacrifice those opportunities of
    improving their worldly position which then- abilities and influence open up
    to them, for the sake of quietly advancing human knowledge. Eich and
    powerful men have very great temptations to turn away from science, so
    that those who devote their time and money to its service prove to us how
    true and pure a love of science exists in this country, and how Englishmen
    will cultivate it when it is in their power to do so.

       Now and then a youth from the poorer classes is enabled by fortunate

     accidents and the aid of a friendly hand to climb to a position of scientific
     activity, and to give us, as Faraday did, a sample of the intellectual powers

     which lie fallow in the great mass of the people.
y' Now, the practical conclusion to which I want to lead you is, that it rests

     with you, who represent the national desire for the advancement of science,
    to take the only measures which can now be taken towards the establish-
     ment of a system of education worthy of this country and adapted to the

     requirements of science. In the present stage of the business the first thing
     to be done is to arouse public attention by all practicable means to the im-
     portance of the want, and to get people gradually to agree to some definite

     and practicable plan of action. You will, I think, find that the best way
     to promote such agreement is to make people consider the natural forces
     which have to be systematized by legislation, with a view of enabling them
    to work freely for the desired purpose. When the conditions essential to

     any national system come to be duly appreciated by those interested in the
ADBRESS.  XCl

cause of education, means will soon be found to carry out the necessary

legislative enactments.

   The highest offices in the State are on our present system filled by men

who, whatever their political opinions and party ties, almost infallibly agree
in their disinterested desire to signalize their respective terms of office by
doing any good in their po^wer. Convince them that a measure desired by
the leaders of public opinion is in itself good and useful, and you are sure to

carry it.

   And, on the other hand, England is not wanting in men both able and

Avilliug to come forward as the champions of any great cause, and to devote

their best po^wers to its service.

   I may v\'ell say this at Bradford after the results achieved by your Member

in the Elementary Education Act.
 · Objections will of course be raised to any system on the score of difficulty
and expense, more especially to a complete and good system. Difficult of
realization it certainly must be, for it will need the devoted and indefatigable

exertions of many an able and high-minded man for many a long year.
Only show how such exertions can be made to produce great and abiding
results, and they will not be wanting. And as for expense, you will surely
agree with me that the more money is distributed in such frugal and effective

manner, the better for the real greatness of our country.

   "What nobler privilege is attached to the j^ossession of money than that of
doing good to our fellow men ? and who would grudge giving freely from
his surplus, or even depriving himself of some comforts, for the sake of pre-

paring the rising generation for a life of the utmost usefulness and consequent

happiness ?

   I confidently trust that the time will come when the chief item in the

annual budget of the Chancellor of the Exchequer will be the vote for

National Education. And when in some later age our nation shall have
passed away, when a more true civilization has grown up and has formed
new centres for its throbbing life, when there are but broken arches to tell
of our bridges and crumbling ruins to mark the sites of our great cathedrals

-- then will the greatest and noblest of England's works stand more jDerfect

and more beautiful than ever ; then will some man survey the results of Old

England's labours in the discovery of imperishable truths and laws of

--nature, and see that her energy and wealth were accompanied by some

nobler attributes that while Englishmen were strong and ambitious enough
to gi'asp power, they were true enough to use it for its only worthy purpose,
that of doiug good 'to others.

    I must not, however, trespass longer upon your time and your kind at>-

tcntion. !My subject would carry me on, yet I must stop without having

half done justice to it.

    If I have succeeded in convincing you that a National system of Educa-

tion is now necessary and possible, and in persuading you to do what you
respectively can to prepare the way for it, I shall feel that the first step is
made towards that great result.

                                         ON

       THE STATE OE SCIENCE.

Heport of the Committee, consisting of Professor Cayley, F.R.S.,

   Professor Stokes, F.R.S., Professor Sir W. Thomson, F.R.S.,
   Professor H. J. S. Smith, F.R.S., and J. W. L. Glaisher^ B.A.,

   F.R.A.S. (Reporter), on Mathematical Tables.

       § 1. General Statement of the Objects of the Committee.

The purposes for which the Committee was appointed were twofold, viz.

(1) to form as complete a catalogue as possible of existing mathematical

tables, and (2) to reprint or calculate tables which were necessary for the

progress of the mathematical sciences.

These two objects, although so far connected, that it Avas absolutely

essential before any tables were calculated or reprinted to be certain that

such tables were not already in existence or easily accessible, were in other

respects quite different ; and the Committee have therefore decided to keep

them distinct. The reasons in favour of the adoption of this course are ob-

viously very strong, as a new table would be out of place in a Report which

in other respects was merely a detailed catalogue. A further argument

against the publication of the tables in the Reports of the Association, is

the great objection to needlessly scattering tables. Tables of a kindred

nature collected together, are of far more value than the same could be if

dispersed in several volumes of a periodical ; and if the tables of the Com-

mittee were published annually as calculated, it would happen not only that

they would have to be sought in several volumes, and their utihty in conse-

quence considerably impaired, but sometimes even portions of the same table

would be separated. The Committee have therefore considered that they

would best carry out the second object for which they were appointed, by

publishing their tables separately and independently of the Annual Reports

of the Association.

The form cliosen for this publication is a quarto of the same size as that

of the Philosophical Transactions, this size being necessary for the uniformity

of the tables, as a large page is required in order to contain the values of the

function tabulated, together with its first, second, and third differences, which,

when given, should range with the former on the same page. Before the

1873.                                                           jj

appointment of the Committee, certain tables of hyperbolic antilogarithms or
exponentials (viz. e^ and e~^) and of hyperbolic sines and cosines had been

commenced by Mr. J. W. L. Glaisher ; and these the Committee determined
to print and stereotype on their completion. They are now in the press.

A mass of ealcnlations has been made for the tabulation of Eessel's functions,

for real and imaginary values ; and it is intended to complete these tables, and
then to undertake calculations connected with the Elliptic Functions.

   As yet no tables have been reprinted by the Committee ; and it clearly
would not be possible to decide which most reqiiired reproduction, uutil the
Report was considerably advanced beyond its present stage.

    All the tables printed by the Committee, whether calculated or reprinted,
are to be stereotyped ; and it is intended that they shall ultimately form a
volume ; but the tables relating to each function will be published and circu-
lated separately as calculated, the stereotype-plates remaining in the posses-
sion of the Committee for future use.

   The first object of the Committee was rendered necessary by the fact that
the mathematical tables that have been formed, are scattered all over the
world in the various mathematical and scientific journals, transactions of
societies, &c., so that it is extremely difficult to ascertain what tables have
been already calculated in any particular branch of science. Another reason is
that tables formed for some particular purpose, and published under a title of

special application, are often of equal importance in other investigations ; so
that great inconvenience is sometimes felt for the want of a table which

already exists under another name and having reference to a different subject
or it may even be recalculated. The difficulty of knowing exactly the work
already done in any subject is one which is common to all parts of science
but the inconvenience resulting from the nature of a work being obscured by
its name is to a great extent peculiar to this subject, or at all events is more

Apainfully felt in connexion with it. familiar instance of a function occurring

in several distinct subjects is the integral le-^V.r, which is of importance

in the determination of the probable error in the method of Least Squares,

Astronomical Refractions, and the theory of Heat; and good instances of

the manner in which the nature of a table can be obscured by its name are

afforded by nautical collections, where under such headings as " Table to

find the latitude by double altitudes of the sun and the elapsed time," or

" Table of logarithmic risings," &c., are given log cosecants, log versed sines,

A(Src. catalogue, therefore, in which the tables were carefully described

from their contents seemed very desirable ; and this the Committee hope to be
able to accomplish by their Reports.

It is intended to include all numerical tables that can be regarded as

belonging to mathematical science, or which are of interest in connexion

therewith                                             but none will be noticed in which the tabular results or data are
                                                   ;

derived from observation or experiment, or merely concern special subjects

that arc not generally classed under the head of mathematics. Thus the

great majority of astronomical tables, including catalogues of stars, tables of

refraction, tables depending on the figure of the earth, &c., will be ex-

cluded, as the data for the formation of such tables are derived from observa-
tion. ^ The same remark applies to all chemical tables, tables of specific gravity,
of weights and measures, for the determination of the longitude at sea, mortality

tables, &c. Life-assurance and annuity tables, and all commercial tables
will also be excluded. With regard to these last, however, although all tables

such as ready reckoners and common interest tables will in general be omitted,
ON MATHEMATICAL TABLES.                                                3

any one that is of value in relation to mathematics as a science will be in-

cluded, although it may have been calculated for merely commercial purposes

and published under a name that would apparently exclude it from this Report.

]\[auy tables of compound interest are valuable when viewed as tables of powers;

and many navigation tables calculated merelj^ for the use of the sailor, and pub-

lished under titles that would imply that they were of a merely technical cha-

racter, are in reality trigonometrical tables under a disguised form.

From the above remarks it will be found in most cases very easy to decide

Awhether a table is included in the scope of this Report or not.  few of course

come on the boundary ; and then there is some little difficulty in drawing the

line fairly. Of this kind are tables for the expression of hours and minutes as

decimals of a day, &c. ; most of these it has been thought better to include.

It was necessary as a preliminary to form a classification of mathematical

(numerical) tables ; and the following classification was drawn up by Prof.

Cayley and adopted by the Committee.

A. Auxiliary for non-logarithmic computations.

          1. Multii:)lication.

        2. Quarter-squares.
       3. Squares, cubes, and higher powers, and reciprocals.

                  traction logarithms, &c.

        5. Circular functions (sines, cosines, (fee), natural, and lengths of circular

                     arcs.

         6. Circular functions (sines, cosines, &c.), logarithmic.

C. Exponential.
        7. Hyperbolic logarithms.

       8. Do. antilogarithms (e^) and h . Itan (45°-\-i(j)), and hyperbolic sines,
               cosines, «fcc., natural and logarithmic.

D. Algebraic constants.
        9. Accurate integer or fractional values. Bernoulli's Nos., A'' 0'"^, &c.
                Binomial coefficients.

   DSeveral of those classes need some little explanation. Thus 9 and 10 are

intended to include the same class of constants, the only difference being that
in 9 accurate values are given, while in 10 they are only approximate ; thus,
for example, the accurate Bernoulli's numbers as vulgar fractions, and the
decimal values of the same to (say) ten places are placed in different classes, as
the former are of theoretical interest, while the latter are only of use in calcu-
lation. It is not necessary to enter into further detail with respect to the
classification, as in point of fact it is only very partially followed in the Report

the final index, however, will be constructed as much in accordance with it as

possible.

    The only perfect method by which all the tables on the above subjects could
be found with any certainty, is to examine all the volumes of the mathema-
tical and philosophical journals and transactions, given in the list prefixed to

--the Eoyal Society's Catalogue of Scientific papers a most laborious work, as

it requires every page in all these periodicals to be looked at, and any nu-
merical tables noted and subsequently examined, while if included in the
scojie of the Committee's work they must further be described. The mere
turning over the pages of several thousand volumes is a work of some labour,
and the completion of the lleport must occupy the Committee for several
years. The Avork is also of such a nature that it would not be possible to
obtain even an approach to completeness in any one class till very considerable
progress had been made with the preliminary examination.

   AThis, however, is not the case to any great extent with the groups and
FB, or with C 7 or the first part of 12, as tables in these classes are gene-

rally to be found in separate books, and not in the memoirs of societies, or

journals. It was possible, therefore, to make progress in the above classes
immediately ; and the portion of the Report now presented to the Association,
practically contains a catalogue of tables which form separate books. The
three broad divisions into which mathematical tables divide themselves

practically are found to be :

   I. Subsidiary tables, which are rather of value as a means of performing
calcidations than of interest in themselves : e. g. multiplication tables,
logarithms, &c. They generally form separate books.

    II. Tables of continuous functions, generally definite integrals.
    III. Tables in the theory of numbers.

Divisions II. and III. contain conclusive (in opposition to siibsidiari/)

tables.

  A fuller description of the contents &c. of Division I. will be found in

§ 2.   It is hoped next year to report on Division II., and  the next  year  on

      ^

Division III. It will be necessary afterwards to add supplements to diflPerent

classes, and notably to the present portion of the Report, which has no claim

at all to be regarded as complete, but is published on the distinct understand-

ing that it is by no means exhaustive with regard to the subjects treated in

it : a supplementary Report on the same subject will be subsequently added;
and it is hoped that thus it will be rendered complete (see § 2).

    .§ 2. General Intro<lmtion to the present Bejiort, and Explanation of Its
                                        Arrangement and Use.

   Art. 1. The present Report is intended to include all general tables, viz.
tables that are of general application in all branches of mathematics, and
are therefore useful wherever calculations have to be performed. The most
simple instances arc multiplication tables, common logarithms of numbers,
                                                                                '

ON MATHEMATICAL TABLES.                                                5"

and trigonometrical functions, -whicli form the basis of, and are the means

by -which all other calculations are made, llegarded from this point of view,

tliis division may be said to contain auxifiary or subsidiary tables, viz. such

as are not per se of any very great intrinsic interest (multiplication tables

are a good instance), but which are nevertheless of such paramount import-

ance that, without their aid, the calculation of other tables would be too

laborious to be practicable. As before remarked, one reason why these tables

may well form a division by themselves is, that, being intended for calcula-

tions of all kinds, they arc usually published separately, and have not to be

sought among the transactions of societies and other periodicals. The num-

ber of tables in this class is of course many times greater than are all the

other classes put together ; but then, on the other hand, they admit of more

brief description, as scarcely any explanation is needed of the functions

tabulated, or of the purposes for which the calculation or publication was

undertaken. In the present Eeport not above five or six tables printed in

periodical publications are noticed ; while it is probable that in the Reports

on the other classes there will not be a much greater number that will have

appeared as separate and independent books.

Art. 2. The object of the lleport is to enable any one by means of it to

find out with ease what tables have been computed on any of the twenty-

five subjects (see § 3) to which  it  relates, and where  they are to  be found
                                                                                                           ;

and the desire to form a catalogue that shall give a systematic and practical

account of the numerical tables in existence that bear upon each of the

subjects included has been steadily kept in view ; in fact little else has been

aimed at. Still, as in the search for and examination of so many books of
tables (the Repoi-t contains an account of more than 230) a good many works

of considerable historical or bibliographical interest came to light, it was ]iot

thought desirable to suppress all notice of them. The majority of seven-

teenth-century works included are described, on account either of their rarity

or because they serve to illustrate the history and progress of the subject.

Of this kind are Napier's ' Canon Mirificus ' (1614), containing the first an-
nouncement of logarithms, Ltidolf's 'Tetragonometria' (1 690), (fee. ; and when

such works have been included, their full titles have been given in § 5, with

suitable bibliographical accuracy. It would be a mistake, however, to suppose

that all the tables of the seventeenth century have been superseded ; VLAca's

' Arithmetica,' 1028, is the most convenient ten-figure table of logarithms

that exists (it has only been reprinted once, and not in so useful a form) ; and

no natural canon published subsequently can bear comparison with Pitiscus,

1613. In performing mathematical calculations, we have had repeated occa-

sion to use both Vlacq and Pitiscus. Uksinus's 'Napierian Canon' (1624)

is the largest in existence. The points in which the Keport is least complete

are the descriptions of common tables of the eighteenth century, and of com-

paratively modern Italian, Spanish, &c. tables of logarithms. Tlie former

class we have purposely omitted, though avo have examined many, as they
are neither of value intrinsically nor historically ; a good many are biiefly

noticed by De Morgan ; and the latter we have not been able to see : several

titles Avill be found in the Babbage Catalogue.

Art. 3. The most valuable detailed list of tables hitherto published is the

article Tables written by De Morgan for Knight's ' English Cyclopasdia

(1861). This article first appeared in the ' Penny Cyclopaedia' (1842), but

it was carefully revised and largely augmented by its author before its re-

printing in the ' English Cyclopedia.' In this article arc contained notices

of 457 tables, many of which, however, are outside the scope of this lleport.

library to which we have had access, or procure one otherwise. De Morgan

says, "Scheibel (additions) may be considered as partly repetition, partly
extension, of Heilbronner. He is one of those bibliographers who collect
from various sources the names and dates of more editions than those who

know catalogues wiU readily believe in."

    It is imnecessary here to mention works on general bibliography, such as

Hain, Ebert, Watt, &c., Avhich are well known; we maj', however, parti-
cularly notice 'Tresor de livres rares et precieux ou Nouveau dictionnaire

bibliographique,' par Jean George Theodore Graesse, Dresde [also Geneva,
London, and Paris], 1859-1867 (7 vols, including supplement), which might

be of use, though we have found the mathematical works it contains very
inaccurately described ; but this is a fault common to all works of general

bibliography.

   Montucla, ' Histoire des Mathematiques,' we have not found valuable ; but
we may call attention to the accurate information given by Delambre in his

' Histoire de I'Astronomie Moderne,' t. i. Paris, 1821 ; and also in his other

histories.

   Reuss's ' Eepertorium Commentationum a.societatibus litterariis editarum,'
GottingEB, 1801-1821, 16 vols. 4to, is a work very similar in its plan to
the Royal Society's Catalogue of Scientific Papers, except that it is an iiidea;
rerum instead of an ijidex auctorum. The mathematics is contained in vol.

vii., the arithmetic occupying pp. 2-31 of that volume. On p. 30 are refer-

ences to descriptions of calculating and other arithmetical machines.

  We have found Nos. XIX. and XX. (on trigonometrical and logarithmic

tables) of Hutton's ' Mathematical Tracts,' London, 3 vols. Svo, 1812, very

useful.

Art. 4. The mode of arrangement of this Report (which properly occu-

--pies § 3, § 4, and § 5), and the reasons that have led to its adoption, are as

follows : If every table were published separately and formed a work by

itself, the obvious course would be to divide them into a certain number of

classes according to their contents, to prefix to each class a brief intro-

duction and explanation, and then to give a detailed description, in chrono-

logical order, of the tables included under it. This is, in fact, the course

that has been pursued with regard to separate tables (i. e. works containing

either a single table  or only tables that come  under the same  class)                          § 3 is
                                                                                              ;
--divided into 25 articles, each article being devoted to one subject: art. 1,

multiplication tables ; art. 2, tables of proportional parts, *fec. (for the con-

tents of all the articles, see the commencement of § 3). Each article begins

with a general account, partly historical, of the subject included in it; and

then follow the' descriptions of the separate tables ou that subject. But the

majority of works noticed are collections, and iuclude tables that are com-

prised under several articles ; thus Hutton's tables contain Biiggian and

hyperbolic logarithms of numbers, a natural and logarithmic canon, &c. &c.,

each of which belongs to a different article. Two courses were therefore

--open for the treatment of such works : (1) to describe them under the article
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;;

having rcftTciicc to the first or largest table in the work, and insert cross

references under each of the articles concerned with the other tables in-,

eluded in the work ; or {2) to describe all collections of tables in a section.
by themselves, and pivo references to each of the tables thej' contain under

the appropriate article in § 3. The second course was clearly the more

--proper, for three reasons (1) because it was free from the arbitrary element

involved in the choice of the leading table, which would be required in the

first method, (2) because it M'as undesirable to overload the articles of § 3

with descriptions of tables not belonging to them, and (3) because reference

to the works would be greatly facilitated by placing them in an article by

themselves                                          § 4 therefore  contains  all woi'ks  the  contents of  which  do  not
                                                 ;

belong wholly to one of the articles in § 3, or, in other words, which con-

tain at least two tables, the subjects of which are included in different

articles of § 3. As the works in § 4 will thus have to be continually re-

feiTcd to separately, they are arranged alphabeticalh', not chronologicallj',

§ 5 is a complete list of all the works containing tables that are described
in this Eeport ; and to facilitate its use as an index, a reference is attached
to the section, or section and article, in which the work is described.

To take an example of the manner in which the Report is intended to be

used. Supposing it were required to know what tables there were of log

versed sines ; the reader would turn to the beginning of § 3, and, looking
down the list of articles, see that, coming under the head of "logarithmic

trigonometrical functions," such tables belonged to art. 15. He would ac-

cordingly turn to art. 15, and read or glance through the introductory

remarks to that article, and the works described there ; not finding any book

containing log versed sines alone described in the article, he would conclude

that no separate table of the kind had come under the notice of the reporter

he would then look at the references to § 4 ; and if he wished for detailed
information with regard to any of those tables, he would examine the de-

scriptions in that section. Any one, on the other hand, desiring to know

the contents of any particular work would seek it in § 5 ; if it occurred there,
a reference would be found added either to § 4, or to § 3 and the article iu
which it is described. No difRcuhy will be experienced in finding the descrip-

tion if it be remembered that all the works are cited by the author's name and

the date ; and that while in § 4 they are arranged alphabetically, in the articles

of § 3 the arrangement is chronological.

   The date is throughout appended to the author's name in citing a work, in

order to identify the work in § 5 (the date given being always that assigned
to the work in § 5) ; there is also the further advantage, that any one who
requires information only with regard to modern tables, still procurable from

the bookseller, need not waste time in seeking the detailed descriptions of

works published in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

   It may be mentioned that a few works that ch contain tables of more than

one kind, arc nevertheless included in § 3 : this happens when the smaller
tables are insignificant compared with those under which the work is classed

references are then appended also in the articles to which the smaller tables

belong.

An asterisk prefixed to an author's name (thus * Voisin or * Voisin) in-

dicates that the description of the work of his referred to has not been derived
from inspection. In ever}' ease where there is no asterisk, the description
has been written by the reporter with the book itself before him.

   Art. 5. In all eases where the author of a collection of tables has num-
bered or marked them himself, his numbering or marking has been followed
                                                                                           ON MATHEMATICAL TABLES.                                                                 i)

in this llcport, except in very exceptional circumstances. "Where, however,
tlic table's are not numbered or otherwise denoted, they have been marked
[T. I.], [T. II.], &c., as it was necessary to have the means of referring to

them, invariably, therefore, where the number of the table is not included
in square brackets, it is to be understood that it is the author's own number.

Thus T. VII. in any particular work implies that the table in question is

numbered A'll. in that Avork, while [T. VII.] implies either that the table

has no number, or that the classification in the work is different from that

adopted in this Ileport. Whenever logarithms arc mentioned Avithout tho

epithet hyperbolic or Napierian, common or Eriggian logarithms (viz. to base

lU) are intended. In some cases, where there might bo some doubt, the

adjective " common " is introduced. By hyperbolic logarithms are always

meant logarithms to the base e (2-71828 . . . ); and these are never called
Napicfiaii, this word being reserved for logarithms of exactly the same kind

as those introduced by Napier (see § 3, art. 1 7). Such a sentence as " Five-
figure logarithms to lOOO," is always to be understood as meaning " logarithms

of numbers from unity to 1000, at intervals of unity to five decimal places ;"

viz., wlien the lower limit of a table is not expressed, it is always to be taken

as unity ; and when the intervals are not mentioned, they are always unity'.
The term "places" is used throughout for " decimal places " or " decimals,"

a number " to 3 places " meaning a number given to 3 2''^(^ces of decimals
(not 'djir/ares). The only exception made to this rule is in the description of

tables of common logarithms ; the words " seven-figure logarithms, six-figure

logarithms," <fec., have become by usage so completely recognized as meaning

logarithms to seven places, to six places, &c., that it did not seem worth while

disturbing the established mode of expression, as it could lead to no error.

    The contents of old works have been described in the language and nota-

tion of the present day, and not in the manner adopted by their authors
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

any peculiarities of notation &c. in a table, however, are pointed out. It was

long universal, and is still very common, to describe trigonometrical tables as

being computed to a certain radius ; these are translated into the language

of  decimals                                                thus a table " to              radius  10,000,000 "             is     described  as  a                                table
                                                         ;

" to seven places," and so on. As a rule the characteristics of the logarithms

have been ignored in describing a table ; i. e. it has not been stated whether

the characteristic was given or no, or, if given, what was the understanding on

which it was added. In many tables, contained in works intended for a special

purpose (as in collections of nautical tables, &c.), arbitrary numbers are added

to or subtracted from the characteristics to facilitate their use in working

some particular formula ; to have included details of this kind would have
taken much room, and been really superfluous, as in most eases all that is
required to be known in the description of a table of logarithms, is the range

of the table, and the number of places to which the mantissa} are given.

  We m!iy here mention that an ambiguity occurs in the description of propor-

tional-part tables                                                                         thus a *' table of proportional  parts  to tenths " may mean
                                                                                        ;

cither that the proportional parts are given for one, two, three, &c. tenths of

the difference, or else that the numbers that form the proportional-part table

are given to one place of decimals. The former is tlie meaning generally in-

tended ; and it would be better if in this ease the words " to tenths " were
replaced by " for every tenth."

  A good many tables had been' described before the ambiguity was noticed;

but it is believed the context will                                                        generally show                   the    true  meaning                                   when
                                                                                                                                                                                ;

the words to tenilis, to hundredths, &c. arc italicized, the latter interpreta-

tion (viz. results given to onO; two, &c. decimal places) is to be assigned.

    Art. 6. To the particular editions of the works described no importance
is to be attributed. It would obviously have been impossible to alwaj^s tix
upon the first or last edition as the one to be described ; in fact we had no
choice ; we took what we could get. The list in § 5 always contains portions
of the titlepage of the same edition of the work that is described in § 3 or
§ 4 of the Eeport ; the particular edition chosen was usually determined by the
accidental circumstance of its being the first that was examined, anj^ informa-
tion that was subsequently obtained about other editions being added at the
end of the description of the contents of the woric in § 3 or § 4. It would
have been better to have always taken as the standard the last edition pro-
curable, and pointed out whereia it differed from its predecessors ; but this
would have required much rewriting of particular portions, and considerably
increased the labour of preparation, with a very small increase of regularity
in the arrangement of the llcport, but with no corresponding increase in its

value.

   Art. 7. In every case where a table has been described from inspection, all
the tables themselves have been examined, and not merely their titlepages,

tables of contents, &c. This was of course absolutely necessary in very many

instances, as it is comparatively rare that any thing more than a general
notion of the contents of a collection of tables can be gathered from the author's
explanations ; but in any case it was essential if the Ileport was to have any
value for accuracy, because the titles assigned by their authors were sometimes
misleading, if not absolutely erroneous ; and frequently, even if the more im-
portant tables had headings or descriptions prefixed, the smaller ones (which are
often more worthy of notice on account of their rarity or mathematical value)
were passed over. It must here be remarked that it is never safe to take
a description of a table from its author or editor, as it is not a very uncommon
thing to give as the contents of a table, not that which can be found from it at
once, but what can be obtained from the table by means of additional Avork,
such as an interpolation. Thus, under the heading " Table of logarithms to
eight decimals " is sometimes given a table to five places, and a formula from
which to calculate the remaining three. ·

    Another case in point is Steinbeeger's table, described in this Report, the
titlepage of which describes it as giving the logarithms of all numbers to

--1,000,000, when in point of fact it only extends to 10,000- the jusiification

for the title being that two more figures can be interpolated for. It is not
to be supposed, when svich misstatements occur, that the author of the table
has any desire to mislead, as they usually result from ignorance ; but it is a
matter of regret, when it has become customary (and most properly so) that
a table should be described on its title as giving onlj' what can be taken out
of it without additional calculation, that this rule should sometimes be vio-
lated and a designation given that is, to say the least, misleading. AVe have

--also met with such instances as the following :- The title of a book is given

ill a bookseller's catalogue as (sav) " Table of divisors of numbers from 1 to
10,000,000 ;" but the following"' words (say), " Part I. from 1 to 150,000"

                                                                                                                                                                        ^

--(when perhaps no more was ever published), are left out an omission of

rather an important character as regards the contents and value of the table.

Cases of this kind show how imperatively necessary it is to examine the

table itself; and whenever the description of a table is taken from an adver-
tisement, bookseller's catalogue, or other second-hand source, there is great

liability to error.

    Art. 8. The names of authors occurring in the text have been printed in
small capitals when the work of theirs alluded to is described in this Eeport,
                                                                                  :

ON MATHEMATICAL TABLES.                                                   11

otherwise in ordinary roman type : thus we should write " the table was

copied from ' Bkiggs's ' Arithmctica ' of 1624," because an account of Eriggs's

work is given in the Eeport ; but we should write " the sines were taken from

Vieta s ' Canon ' 1579," because Vieta's work is  not described.   This  rule is

                                                                  _

attended to always whenever an author's name is mentioned in juxtaposition

with his work, and it wiU be found to save unnecessary trouble in searching

for works not noticed in the Eeport. Of course all rules are sometimes diffi-
cult to carry out ; and in cases such as when the author's name and work are
separated from one another, or the name occurs frequently in a paragraph by

itself, but really in connexion with some work not expressly named each time,

&c., we have attempted to carry out the spirit of the rule and no more. An

author's name is enclosed in square brackets (thus [Pell] or [Pell]) when

his name does not occur on the titlepage of the work of his referred to.

Art, 9. The words 8vo, 4to, &c. are used in § 5 to signify works of

octavo, quarto, &c. size, without reference to the number of pages to the sheet.

They are merely intended to give a rough idea of the size and shape of the work,

which is better done by using them in a general sense than by attaching to
them their technical meanings. The words " large " or "small " have been
prefixed when the size was markedly different from what is usual. It must
be remembered that two hundred years ago all the sizes were much smaller

thau at present, so that the usual quarto page of 1650 is smaller than an

octavo page of our day, though the shape is of course more square. Old works

are generally described as they would have been at the time ; but it sometimes

may have happened that a true quarto of old date is here given as octavo, &c.

this caution is necessary for those who might use §5 bibliographically.

Whenever, in transcribing portions of works in § 5, words have been omitted

Wefrom the titlepage, dots have been inserted to mark the omissions.      may

mention that we have used the word reprint in its proper sense ; viz. we have

not spoken of a reprint except when the type was reset.

Art. 10. In the preparation of this Eeport extensive use has been made of the

libraries of the British Museum, the Eoyal Society, the University of Cam-

bridge, the Eoyal Observatory, Trinity CoUege (Cambridge), and the Eoyal

Astronomical Society, in one or other of which the majority of the works

Wenoticed are contained.  have also, through the kindness of Professor

Henrici, been enabled to consult the Graves Library at University College,

London, which contains an almost imrivalled collection of old mathematical

works ; but as they are not yet arranged, it is not possible to find any par-
ticular work without great expenditure of time and labour. The De-Morgan

library at the London University is also still in process of arrangement, and is

therefore inaccessible for the present. By the kindness of Mr. Tucker, who

forwarded us an early copy of the sale-catalogue of the late Mr. Babbagc's

library, we have been enabled to extract several titles from it, and identify

works of the titles of which we had only imperfect descriptions ; but we have

not been able to see any of the books themselves. It must not be understood

that the Eeport contains notices of all the books of mathematical tables

contained in the libraries mentioned at the beginning of this article. Por in-

stance, the Eoyal Society's catalogue contains the titles of several works that

should be included but which we have not yet examined ; and of course no

one can know what tables there are in such Ebraries as those of the British

Museum or the Cambridge University, where there is no catalogue of subjects.

For the omissions we could have rectified we must plead in excuse the

already great extent of the Eeport, and consequent necessity of drawing the

line somewhere. Of coiu'sc many of the works noticed o,xq either in our own
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

ance rendered b)^ Mr. C. W. Mcrrifield, F.R.S., of whose mathematical library
we hope to make more nsc in a future Eeport.

   Art. 11. The lleport is avowedly very imperfect; it contains probably not
one half of the works that have as good a right to be noticed as those that
are iuchided. This defect will be remedied by the publication of an Appen-
dix or additional lleport on the same subject, probably after the appearance
of the Eeports on the other divisions. As it would be clearly impossible to
have made this lleport perfect (and had it been possible, it would have occu-
pied more space than could be given to it), an Appendix giving the results
of the examinations of the memoirs, transactions, &c. in reference to this
class of tables would have had in any case to be added after the com-
pletion of the other divisions ; and on this account it seemed unnecessary
to take especial pains to procure works that were clearly of no very great
importance, or to insert imperfect second-hand accounts of tables that would
in all probability be met with in the course of the formation of the subse-
quent Reports. Invariably, however, whenever a reference was found to a
table that seemed of importance, no pains have been spared in the endeavour
to obtain and examine a copy ; in the event of these efforts being fruitless,
a notice of the work compiled from other accounts has been given, with an
intimation of the source whence the information was derived ; but only three
or four works arc included that have not come under the eye of the reporter.

It is probable that there may have been published recent works on the

continent no coj^j' of which is contained in any of the public libraries of this
country ; and on this account it will probably be found very difficult to
make the list perfect. The present Report is, however, so far complete that

the Committee think they may ask mathematicians or comimters who are ac-
quainted with any works not included in it or in De Morgan, to inform them
of the fact. It is only in this way that completeness can bo obtained, as

although, by an examination of the transactions &c. to M^hich references are
given at the beginning of the Royal Society's catalogue, the completion of the
accounts of tables contained in memoirs &c. would be merely a matter of time
and labour on the part of the members of the Committee, the discovery and de-
scription of books printed in out-of-lhe-way places, or for private circulation,

can only be effected by the cooperation of mathematicians who may happen
to possess copies*. The Report, however, as it now stands, will be found to

contain more information about tables than is to be found anywhere else ; in

fact, except De Morgan's list (referred to in art. 3 of this section), we know no
place where any attempt is made to cover the ground included in this Report
and though De Morgan has referred to more works than are described here in
detail (even when commercial tables are excluded), it must be borne in mind

that his descriptions are too short and general to be of great value, that more
than a third of his accounts arc compiled from sources other than the original
works, and that he has made no attempt to do more than roughly classify the
works (not the tables) ; in fact a more detailed description or classification was
excluded by the plan of his article, Avhich notwithstanding gives a great deal

of information in a very small space.

   Art. 12. By an oversight (which was not discovered till it was too late to
remedy it) wc have excluded from the Report traverse tables, viz. Differencc-

of-latitude and Departure tables, which under the head of multii^les of sines
and cosines ought to have been noticed. Such tables are of general use in

·which was constructed for mining- (not nautical) purposes.

AVo hope to repair the omission by Jippending a separate list of traverse

tables to a future Keport.

  AArt. 13. very important incidental gain that it was hoped would be

afforded by the present lleport, was the opportunity of correcting errors in loga-
rithmic and other tables by giving references to the places in which errata-lists
had been published. In the introductions or prefaces to works containing
tables, it is usual to give a list of the errors that have been found during
their preparation in previous tables ; and as few possessors of a work can be
acquainted with the publications that have appeared subsequently, it was

thought that by referring, under each title, to the works or periodicals in
which lists of errata in it had appeared, an important service would be rendered.
It was soon evident, however, that it was impossible to deal adequately with the

subject of errors in this manner. Many of the important collections have

been through very numerous editions ; and it was not always stated in which
editions the errors M'crc found ; and when the edition was stated, it was
doubtful (without examination) whether the errata-list in question had come

under the eye of the editor, and the errors been corrected in subsequent
editions, or not. In the case of stereotyped tables, successive tirages are more

and more accurate ; and in regard to collections of such tables published long-
ago, as, for example, Callct (first published in 1783, though since reset), it seems
useless to waste space by giving references to the numerous errata-lists that
have been published, some of which must necessarily relate only to the earlier

tirages, and must have been corrected long ago. This is the case with all the
chief tables, and only in particular instances, when circumstances rendered it

probable that the errata-lists would be of use, have references been given to
them. As, however, this state of affairs is very unsatisfactory, it is hoped

that in a subsequent Report a complete list of errors in later editions of the

most-used mathematical tables, still unsuperseded, may be given ; but it is ne-

cessary first to be satisfied that the errata given are not erroneous themselves.

Many of the chief modern lists of errata arc noticed in this lleport, and also
others that it seemed desirable to give references to at once ; but we have
made no effort to deal with the matter in a complete manner. It is much to
to be regretted that it is not iisual for editors of a new edition of a table to

goive a list of the errors that occurred in former editions, and have been corrected

in that edition. It is only fair for the purchaser of a new edition of a work

to be informed wherein it difters from its predecessors ; but imfortunately the

object of the editor and publisher is to sell as many copies of the new edition,

not to render the old as valuable as the new. It is proper to add, however,

that usually, when tables are published by a mathematician for the advance-

ment of science, and not by a bookseller and editor for the sake of profit, an

Aexception is made to this rule, and errata are freely acknowledged.                                          renuirk

made by De Moi'gan with reference to mathematical books in general, viz.

that the absence of a list of errata means, not that there are no errors, but

merely that they have not been found out, is more applicable to tables than

to  any other  class                                     of  work, in  spite  of  the care  usually bestowed  on them
                                                                                                                                                          ;

and an error in a table is far more fatal than an error in any other class of

work, as there is no context (as far as the user is concerned) to show imme-

diately that the result taken from the table is erroneous. The subject of

errors will particularly occupy the attention of the Committee in a future

lleport.

--14 REPORT 18/3.

   Art. 14. The whole of the work required in the preparation of the Eeport
has been carefully performed ; and we believe that not many inaccuracies will
be found. Every work noticed, except only three or four, has been described
from actual inspection ; and the account has invariably been written with tlie
book before us. Every one, however, who has had any experience of biblio-
graphical work knows how impossible it is to be always accurate ; the work
has often to bo performed in public libraries open only for a few hours in the
day, so that any one who has not an unlimited number of days at his command,
must sometimes work under pressure. Omissions are thus made, which, when
discovered during the revision six months afterwards, cannot be rectified
without great loss of time, even if it be remembered what library it was that
contained the work in question. The references from one part of the Eeport
to another will also, it is believed, be found correct ; but as the whole plan
and arrangement have been altered in the course of the year over which the
preparation of the Ileport has lasted, it is possible that some of the old refer-

ences may remain still uncorrected. If this should be found to be the case, not
much difficulty can ever be experienced in seeing what is meant with the aid

of the list of articles at the beginning of § 3, and the list of works in § 5 ;
also if any misprints (such as T. IT. for T. III. &c.) should escape notice in
the correction of the proofs, the reader will be enabled to correct these with-

out much waste of time. Lists of errata and corrections, should such bo
needed, will be given in subsequent Reports. ^Yhenever we have made a
statement on some otlier authority than that of our own observation, we have
invariably stated it, though we are aware that we thus lay ourselves ojien to
the imputation of not having verified facts of the accuracy of which we might
have assured ourselves ; but, as De Morgan has observed, the possibility of

writing a history entirely from personal observation of the originals has not
yet been demonstrated.

                                           Art. 1. MnU'ii^llcation Tables.

   The use of the multiplication table is so essential a part of the history of
Numeration and Arithmetic, that for information witli regard to its introduc-
tion and application -^e must refer to Peacock's ' History of Arithmetic ' in
the ' Encyclopaedia Metropolitana,' to De Morgan's ' Arithmetical Books
(London, 1847), as well as to Heilbronner, Delambre, &c. (see § 2, art. 3),
to Leslie's * Philosophy of Arithmetic,' and perhaps to Barlow's * Theory of
jS'umbers' (London, 1811), in most of which references to other works Avill
be found. There is abundant evidence that, till comparatively recent times
(say the beginning of the eighteenth century), multiplication was regarded
as a most laborious operation ; this is testified not only indirectly by the very
simple examples given in old arithmetics, but explicitly by Decker in his
' Eerste Deel vande Nieuwe Telkonst ' (see Phil. Mag. Suppl. Number, Dec.
1872). The great popularity of Napier's bones, and the eagerness with

which they were received all over Europe, show how great an assistance the

simplest contrivance for reducing the labour of multiplications was considered
to be. It would be interesting to know how- mucli of the multiplication
computers were in the habit of committing to memory, as the bones would

be no great help to any one who knew it as far as nine times nine. In this
Report, however, we are only concerned with extended multiplication tables

(viz. such as are to be used as tables, and were not intended to be committed

to memory). The earliest printed table of multiplication we have seen re-
ferred to is Thomas Finck's ' Tabulae Multiplicationis et Divisionis, seorsim
ctiam Moneta3 Danicas accommodatae,' Hafnia;, 1604 (which title De Morgan

obtained from Prof. "Werlauff, Royal Librarian at Copenhagen) ; but the
work, from its title, must have been rather a ready reckoner than a proper
scientific table. The earliest largo table, which, strange to say, is still as exten-
sive as aiiy (it has been equalled, but not surpassed, by Ckelie, 1864), is Heeavaet
AB Hohenbukg's ' Tabulae Arithmetical 7rpoi7da(j>aipeaeios Universales,' 1010,
described at length below. Of double-entry tables, Creli-e's ' Rechentafeln,'
1804, is the most useful, and the most used, for general purposes. The other
important tables are chiefly for multiplication by a single digit.

  A multiplication table is usually of double entry, the two arguments being

the two factors ; and when so arranged, it is frequently called a " Pythagorean
Table.'' The great amount of room occupied by Pythagorean tables (no
table so arranged could extend to 1000 x 10,000, and be of practicable size)
has directed attention to modes of arrangement by which multiplication can
be performed by a table of single entry ; the most important of these are
tables of quarter-squares, which are described in § 3, art. 3, where are also
added some remarks on multiplication tables of single entry. See also Dilling,

described below.

   It is almost unnecessary to add that, when not more than seven or ten
figures arc required, multiplication can be performed at once by logarithms,
which (though not the best method for two factors when either a Pythagorean
                                                                                                            ;

or quarter-square table of suitable extent is at hand) have the advantage

that by their means any number of factors can be multiplied together at

once.

    Geuson's table, 1798,13 for multiplications of a somewhat different kind from

the rest.

Crelle, in the introduction to his ' Itcchentafeln ' (1820), mentions a

MM.work, ' Tables do Multiplication, i\ I'usagc do                                  les gcomL'trcs, de Mm. les

which he says extends to 500 x 500, and occupies 500 quarto pages ; while,

he adds, his own work, -which is four times the extent, occupies only 1800

octavo pages. For the full titles of Picarte's ' Tables de MultipHcation ' and

' Tableau Pithagorique,' see under Picaete (1861), in § 3, art. 7.

Closely connected with multiplication tables ai-e so-called ProportionaJ-parts

tables (described in the next article) ; and very frequently in the latter the

last figure is not contracted, so that by a mere chauge of the position of the

decimal point they become tables of multiples.

Herwart ab Hohenburg, 1610.                                                   2xMultiplication table, from  1 to

1000 X 1000. The thousand multiples of any one of the numbers are con-

tained on the same page, so that (as the number 1 is omitted) there are 999

pages of tables. By a strange oversight, the numbering begins with 1 on

the first page of the table instead of 2, so that the multiples of n are found

--on page n \ : this is inconvenient, as the number of the page alone appears

on it, so that (say) to find a multiple of 898 we seek the page headed 897.

Each page contains 100 lines, numbered in the left-hand column 1, 2, 3, ...

and besides this column of arguments there are ten columns headed 0, 100,

. . . 900. The first figure of the multiplier is therefore found at the top of

the column, and the last two in the left-hand column (on p. 3 it will be

noticed 200 and 300 are interchanged at the top of the columns). There

being more than 1000 pages of thick paper, the book, as De Morgan Jias

observed, forms a folio of almost unique thickness. Also, as the pages con-

Leslie (Philosophy of Arithmetic, 2nd edit. 1820, p. 246) was quite right in
calling it " a very ponderous folio." De Morgan saj^s"the book is exces-

sively rare ; a copy sold by auction a few years ago was the onlj' one we

   Ktistner (' Geschichte,' t. iii. p. 8) quotes the remark of Heilbronner (who
gives the title of the work, ' Hist. Math.' p. 801), " Docet in his tabulis sine

abaco mulliplicationcm atque divisionem perficere," &c., and adds that Heil-

bronner could not have seen the work, or he would have described it ; he

remembers to have read that it was like a great multiplication table. The

title is given by Murhard, and marked with an asterisk to show that he had

seen a copy. Hogg gives the title very imperfectly ; and it is clear the work

has not been in his hands. There is a complete copy in the Britisli Museum,

and a copy in the Graves Library ; but the latter is imperfect, the pages

12-25, 120-145, and 468-517 having been lost, and their places supplied

with blank paper. On account of the rarity of the work, and the great in-

terest attaching to it from the time when it was published, we have thought

it worth while to give tlie title in full in § 5. The clearness of the type
and the extent of the table (which has not been surpassed, and only equalled

by Crelle, 1864), taken in connexion with its early date (fou]- years before

Herwart passes for the author ; but nothing indicates more than that the

Wemanuscript was found in his possession."       have seen the statement that

while Napier solved triangles by logarithms, Herwart did so by prosthaphce-

rcsis, and others of the like kind, the inference being that Herwart invented

a method which has been superseded by logarithms ; this (if the present
work is the source of the statement) is incorrect, Herwart's table being

merely useful in facilitating the multiplications required in the formulte.

There are in the Eritish Museum three other works of Herwart ab Hohen-

burg : viz., ' Thesaurus Hieroglyphicorum e museo Joanuis Georgii Herwait

ab Hohenburg . . .' (Obi. fol. Munich ?, 1610 ?) ; ' Novaj, verse et exacte ad cal-

culum . , . Chronologise e museo . . .' Small 4to, 1612; and 'Ludovicus Quartus

Imperator defensus . . . ab Joanne Georgio Herwarto' &c. 4to. Munich, 1618

(the middle one of which is given in Lalande's Bib. Ast.). "We have looked

at these three books in the hope that some mention might be made in them

of the table, or some information given about Herwart's Museum ; but they

Weappear to contain nothing of the kind.  have seen also the titles of several

other works of Herwart's, and references to where particulars of his life are

to be found ; so that, considering the attention so large a work as his table
must have received from contemporary mathematicians, we still have hopes

of being able to bring to light some information with regard to its calciilator,

· his objects, &c.

     It should be stated that Herwart ab Hohenburg is spoken of quite as fre-
 quently by the name of Hohenburg as by that of HerAvart.

     The author of the anonymous table (17*J3) described below, states that
 many errors were found in Herwabt, and that Schiibler (whose table we have
 not seen) was much more correct.

Gruson, 1798. The first part of this book contains a number of tables,

the description of any one of which will explain the arrangement. Take the

table 36 : it has ten columns, headed 0, 91, 2, . . . , (as have all the other

tables), and 36 lines, numbered 0, 1, 2, . . , 35 ; we find in column 6 and

we find table 36, column 6, line 21, and have the result given in inches.

There are tables for all numbers from 1 to 100, and for primes from 100 to

400, the number of lines in each table being equal to the number of the

table. The use of the tables in performing ordinary divisions and multipli-

cations when there are four or more figures in the divisor or dividend, &c. is

fully explained by the author in the introduction. When used for division,

the table gives the quotient and the remainder.

There is also given a table of all simple divisions of numbers (not divisible

  Gruson, 1799. A table of products to 9 x 10,000. The pages, which

arc very large (containing 125 lines), are divided into two by a vertical line,
each half page containing ten columns, giving the numbers and their first

nine multiples : the first half of the first page thus ends at 9 x 124, the
second half at 9 x 249 ; and there are 1992 tabular results to the page. The

table has only one tenth of the range of Bketschneider's ; but the result is

given at once ; however, the large size of the page (almost, if not quite, the

largest we have seen for a table) is a great disadvantage. There are two

pages of explanation &c.

   The title describes the table as extending to 100,000, the above being only
the first part, "We do not know whether any more was published, but think
probably not. Eogg mentions no more. At the end of the introduction

three errors occurring in some copies are given.

Martin, 1801. This is a large collection of tables on money-changing,

rentes, weights and measures, &c. The only part of the book that needs

notice here is Chapter XI., which contains a multiplication table giving the

first nine multiples of the numbers from 101 to 1052 (19 pp.).
   Dilling, 1820. In the use of a table of logarithms to multiply numbers

together, the logarithms used are of no vahie in themselves, being got rid of

before the final result. If, therefore, letters a, 6, c, ... be used instead, we
have no occasion to know the values of any one of them, but only the way in

which they are related to one another. The present table is constructed for

numbers up to 1000 on this principle ; within this range there are about 170

l^rimes, the logarithms of which have to be denoted by separate symbols,

a,h, &c.. .. ,                the powers of 2 are denoted  by numbers ;  thus
z,  ffj,   6j,  .  .,      ;
                        .

log (2^)=2, log (2')=3, &c. ; and the logarithms of any number to 1000 can

+be easily expressed in not more than four terms; thus log 84=2 rt-|-c.

There is also a table of antilogarithms arranged according to the last letter

+involved; thus log 21=«,-|-o, log 15=a-|-6, the sum =2« Z»4-c ; and

Weentering the antilogarithmic table at c, we find 315 the product.      can

thus only multiply numbers whose pi'oduct is less than 1000 ; and a table of
products of the same size would certainly have been more useful. The table

can of course be used for division, square roots, &c., but only if the result is

integral, so that it is little more than a matter of curiosity. Tliis table was

intended, however, only as a specimen, to be followed by a larger one to

We10,000.  believe the continuation was not published ; and Eogg refers to

no Other work of Dilling,

The work, although nominally a table of logarithms, is included in this

article, as it is reaUy a multiplication table. It is the only table we have met

with involving a principle which at one time would have been of value with

respect to multiplication, viz. to resolve the numbers into their prime factors,

and multiply them by adding their factors. Thus 21 =3 X 7, 15 = 3x5, and

their product 315=3' X 5 X 7 ; if therefore we had a table giving the prime

factors of all numbers from 1 to 1000, arranged in order, and another table

of like extent giving the numbers corresponding to the same products of

factors, arranged with the largest factor first, and the others in descending

order, so as to facilitate the entry, we could perform multiplication (where

the product does not exceed 1000) by addition only. In the construction of
such a table it would soon be found convenient to replace the two and throe
ON MATIIEM^.TICAL TABLES.                                             19

figure primes by letters, to save room, and, in fact, to use letters tliroiigli-

--out and further to simplify the printing by writing «* as 4a, &c., which

would do equally well ; we then have Dilling's tables, which have not the

smallest connexion with logarithms. Such a table might once have been

found useful ; but the slightest consideration shows that (except as a factor
table) it would be all but valueless now. The space a large table of the kind

would occupy, the impossibility of arranging the antifactor table so as to
admit of easy entry, and the great convenience of existing tables (both

Pythagorean and logarithmic) are alone sufficient to prove this.

   Crelle, 1836. This table occupies 1000 pages, and gives the product of

a number of seven figures by 1, 2, ... , 9, by a double operation, very much

in the same manner as Bretschneider's does for a number of five : viz., each

page is divided into two tables ; thus, to multiply 9382477 by 7, we turn to
page 825, and enter the right-hand table at line 77, column 7, where we find

77339 ; we then enter the left-hand table on the same page, at line 93,
Wecolumn 7, and find 050, so that the product required is 05077339.^
                                                                      think

for numbers seven figures long the table effects a considerable saving of time,

as it is as easy to use as BRExsciiNEinEK s for five figures. It would take some

little practice to use the table rapidly in all cases, as of course the mode of

entry, &e. must be varied according as the number consists of seven, six,

five, &c. figures ; but the value of a table is measured not by the trouble

lequired to learn to use it, but by the time saved by means of it after the

computer has learnt its use.

   Bretschneider, 1841. This table is for the multiplication of any
number up to 100,000 by a single digit. On each page there are two tables,

the upper of which occupies ten lines, and the lower fifty. An example will

show the method of using the table. Suppose it required to multiply
50878 by 7, then the table is entered on the page headed 0800 (the headings
run from to 99, with two ciphers added to each). Facing 78 in the lower

table we find *146 ; and in the upper table facing 568, in the column for 7,

we find 397; the product required is therefore 398146, the third figure
being increased because the 146 was marked by an asterisk. The arguments

in the upper table, on the page headed 0800, are 08,168,208 . . . 908 (twice
repeated for the two cases when succeeding numbers are less and greater

than 50), and also 1, 2 ... 9, as the table is of double entry.

   The arrangement of the table is thus very ingenious ; but, as De Morgan

has remarked, multiplication by a single digit is so simple an operation that

it is questionable how far a table is serviceable when its use requires three

distinct points to be attended to.

   The introduction (10 pages) gives a complete explanation of how the table
can be used when the number of figures is greater than five. Having made
some use of the table for this purpose, we do not think any time is saved by
it ; at all events, not imtil the computer has had much practice in using it.

   Crelle, 1804. This magnificent table gives products up to 1000 x 1000,

arranged in a most convenient and elegant manner, one consequence of which
is that all the multiples of any number appear on the same page. It is also
very easy to get used to the arrangement of the table, which is as useful for
divisions as multiplications. It can be used for multiplying numbers which

contain more than three figures, by performing the operation, three figures
at a time ; but it requires some practice to do this readily ; and a similar

remark applies to the extraction of square roots.
    There is one great ineouvenieuco that every computer must feel in using

the work, viz. that the multiples of numbers ending in arc omitted, so that,
                                                                                                      c2

for example, we pass from 39 to 41. It is quite true that the columns for
40 are the same as those for 4 with the addition of a ; but the awkward-

ness of turning to opposite ends of the book for (say) 889 and 890, and then

having to add a to the latter, is very great. It is a pity that a desire to

save a few pages should have been allowed to impair the utility (and it docs
so 'most seriously) of so fine a table. The matter is referred to in the
preface, where it is said that Crelle, " after mature reflection," decided to

omit these numbers.

The original edition was published in 1820, and consisted of two thick

octavo volumes, the first proceeding as far as 500x1000, and the secord

completing the table to 1000 x 1000. The inconven'cnce refeiTcd to above

is felt more strongly in this than in the one-vo\imc edition, as frequently the
numbei-s ending in have to be sought in a different volume from the others.

Both editions are, we believe, very accurate. There are 3 pp. of errata
(pp. xvii-xix) at the beginning of the edition of 1820. De Morgan gives

1857 as the date of Bremiker's reprint, and says he has heard that other

copies bear the date 1859, and have no editor's name.

Laundy, 1865. The first nine multiples of all numbers from 1 to 100,000,

given by a double arrangement : viz., if it is required to multiply 15395 by 8,

we enter the table on p. 4 (as 395 is intermediate to 300 and 400) at 15,

and in column 8 find 122 ; we enter another table on the same page at 395,

Weand in column 8 find 160; the product is therefore 123160.                       take this

number instead of 122160 because in the column headed 8, first used, there

appears the note [375]*, the meaniug of which is that if the last three figures

of the number exceed 375 (they are 395 in the above example) the third

figure is to be increased bj'^ unity. The table is thus seen to be the same in

lyrlnciple as ERETScnNEiDER, but not quite so convenient. There are the same

objections to this as to the latter table. The present table occupies 10 pp.

4to, and Beetschneider's 99 pp. 8vo.

Mr. Laundy remarks in his preface that Crelle's ' Erloichtcrungs-Tafel,'

1836, although one hundred times as largo as his, "must not bo estimated as

presenting advantages proportionate to its vast difference of extent." In this

we scarcely agree ; for it is only when the numbers are six or seven figures

long that one begins to feel the advantages of a table for so simple an operation

as multiplication by a single digit, and Crelle's table would not take much

longer to use than the present.

parts of all numbers from 43 to 434 (note that near the commencement of

the table, viz. from diff. 434 to diff. 340, the proportional parts are only

given for every other difference in some tables ; whether a table gives the

proportional parts of all the differences or not is generally noted in § 4),

ISeveral scven-fignre tables extend to 108,000 ; and for the last 8000 the dif-

fei'ences decrease from 434 to 403. Tables in which «=60 often accompany

canons of trigonometrical functions that give the results for every minute, for

convenience of interpolating for seconds; such must be sought from the

descriptions of trigonometrical tables in § 3, arts. 10 and 15, and in § 4

we have also seen tables for which rt=30, where the functions are tabulated

for every two minutes or two seconds.

   There are several tables to which proportional parts of the differences to

hundredths (viz. in which «=:100) are attached, e.g. Gray (§ 3, art. 19),

FiLiPowsKi (§ 4), and Pineto (§ 3, art. 13) ; but the ranges of the differences
arc generally so small that it is not worth while giving references. In

PiNETO, for instance, the range of the differences is only from 4295 to 4343

(in this work multiples are given, the last two figures being separated by a

comma).

The only separate table of proportional parts, properly so called, that we

have seen, is

Bremiker, 1843 (' Tafel der Proportionaltheile '). Proportional parts to

hundredths (viz. miiltiples from 1 to 100, with the last figure omitted, and

Athe last but one corrected) of all numbers from 70 to 099.  very useful

table, chiefly intended for use in interpolating for the sixth and seventh figures

in logarithmic calculations.

large table of proportional parts.

It is to be noticed that all multiplication tables are, or rather can be used

Aas proportional-part tables.  table of multiples, with the last figure omitted,

and the last but one corrected (which can be done at sight), is a proportional-

It is proper here to allude to slide-rules and other mechanical appliances

                       Art. 3. Tables of Quarter Squares.

Tables of quarter squares have for their object to facilitate the performance

of multiplications ; and the principle on which their utility depends is con-

tained in the formula  ab = i(a+hy-l{a-hy-,

so that with such a table to multiply two numbers we subtract the quarter
square of the difference from that of their sum ; the multiplication is there-

fore replaced by an addition, a subtraction, two single entries of the tables,

--and a final subtraction a very considerable saving if the numbers be high.

The work is more than with a product table, where a double entry gives the
result at once ; but the quarter squares occupy much less space, and can
--Z2 REPOBT 1873.

therefore be tabulated to a mucb. greater extent without inconvenience. In
tables of quarter squares the fraction ^ which occurs when the number is
odd is invariably left out ; this gives rise to no difficulty, as the sum and
difference of two numbers must be both odd or both even.

  A product can, of course, be obtained by logarithms with about the same

facility as by a table of quarter squares ; but the latter is preferable when all

the figures of the result are required.

    LuDOLF, 1690 (see § 3, art. 4), in the preface to his 'Tetragonometria,'

explains the method of quarter squares completely, and shows how his table

is to be used for the purposes of multiplication. The earliest tabic oi quarter

squares De Morgan had heard of was Voisin, 1817 ; but Centnerschwer (see
below) refers to one by BUrger of the same date, the full title of which we

have quoted from Bogg.

     Crelle, in the preface to the first edition of his ' Eechentafeln ' (1820,

p. XV.), speaks of " Quadrat-Tafelu nach Laplace und Gergonne, mittelst
welchcr sicli Producte fiudcn lassen," &c. The allusion to Laplace doubtless
refers to the memoir in the ' Journal Polytechuique,' noticed further on in
this article ; but we cannot give the reference to Gergonne.

    The largest table of quarter squares that has been constructed is that
published by the late Mr. Laundy, which extends as far as the quarter

square of 100,000 ; it would be desirable, however, to have a table of double

this extent (viz. to 200,000), which would perform at once nnilti])lications of
five figures by five figures (Mr. Laundy's table is only directly available

when the sum of the ni;mbers to be multiplied is also of five figures). The
late General Shortrede constructed such a table, we believe, in India, but

 unfortunately abandoned the idea of publishing it on his return to England,

 where he found so much of the field already covered by Laundy's tables.
De Morgan, writing when it was anticipated that Shortrede's table would be
 pubhshed, suggested that it would be convenient that the second half should
 appear first ; and we should much like to see the publication of a quarter-
 square table of the numbers from 100,000 to 200,000.

     Mr. Laundy, in the preface to his ' Table of Quarter Squares ' (p. vi), says
 that Galbraith, in his ' General Tables,' 2nd edit. 1836, Avhich Avcrc intended
 as a supplement to the second edition of his ' Mathematical and Astronomical
 Tables,' gives a table (T. xxxiv.) of quarter squares of numbers from 1 to

 8149. This book is neither in the British Museum nor the Cambridge Uni-

 versity Library. The second edition of his ' Mathematical and Astronomical
 Tables ' (1834) contains no such table. There is, however, no doubt about
 the existence of the work, as the Babbage Catalogue contains the title
 " Galbraith, "\Y., N"ew and concise General Tables for computing the Obhquity
 of the Ecliptic, &c. Edinburgh, 1836."

     In 1854, Prof. Sjdvester having seen a paper in Gergonne in which the
 method was referred to, and not being aware that tables of quarter squares

--for facilitating multiplications had been published, suggested the calculation

 of such tables, in two papers " jSFote on a Formula by aid of which, and of a

 tabic of single entry, the continued product of any set of numbers . . . may be

 effected by additions and subtractions only without the use of Logarithms "

 (Philosophical Magazine, S. 4. vol. vii. p. 430), and "On Muhiplication by

 aid of a Table of Single Entry " (Assurance Magazine, vol. iv. p. 236). Both
 these papers were probably written together ; but there is added to the former
 a postscript, in which reference is made to Voisin and Shortrede's manuscript.
  Prof. Sylvester gives a generalization of the formula for ah as the difference
 of two squares, in which the product a^ a., . . . «,, is expressed as the sum of

the product of three quantities the formula is

         abc=^{{a+b + cf-(a + b-cy-(c + a-hf-{b + c-ayi

And at the end of the ' Philosophical-Magazine ' paper, Prof. Sylvester has

added some remarks on how a table to give triple products should bo

arranged.

   At the end of a memoir, " Sur divers points d'Analyse," Laplace has given
a section " Sur la Eeduction des Fonctions en Tables " (Journal de I'Ecole

Polytechnique, Cah. xv. t. viii. pp. 258-265, 1809), in which he has briefly

discussed the question of multiplication by a table of single entry. His

aual}-sis leads him to the method of logarithms, quarter squares, and also to the

formula siua sin&=r|{cos(rt-- 6)-- cos(a + 6)}, by which multiplication can

be performed by means of a table of sines and cosines. On this he remarks,

" Cette maniere ingenieuse de faire servir des tables de sinus a la multiplication

des nombres, fut imaginee et employe'e un siecle environ avaut I'iuveution

des logarithmes."

It is worth notice that the quarter-square formula is deduced at once from

=g -- -- +sin rt sin 6 { cos (« i) cos (a b)},'by expanding the trigonometrical func-

tions and equating the terms of two dimensions ; similarly from sin a sin b

= + + + + -- + +6--sin c j{sin (« c-- 6) sin(a
                                    c) sin(6-|-c-- a) sin (a 6 c)}, by
--equating the terms of three dimensions, we obtain abc=-^{(a-\-b-^cy &c. },

Weas written down above, and so on, the general law being easily seen.

may remark that there is an important distinction between the trigonometrical

formulas and the algebraical deductions from them, viz. that by the latter to

multiply two factors we require a table of squares, to multiply three a table

of cubes, and so on ; {. e. each different number of factors requii'es a sepa-

rate table; while one and the same table of sines and cosines wiU serve to

multi])ly any number of factors. This latter property is shared by tables of

logarithms of numbers, the use of which is of course in every way preferable ;

still it is interesting to note the inferiority that theoretically attaches to the

algebraical compared with the trigonometrical formulo3. Other remarks on the

subject of multiplication by tables are to be found in § 3, art. 1.

   It is almost imnecessary to remark that a table of squares may be used

instead of one of quarter squares if the semisum and semidifference of the

numbers to be multiplied be taken as factors. Tables of squares and cubes

are described in the next section.

Leslie, 1820. On pp. 249-250 there is a table of quarter squares of

numbers from 1 to 2000, reprinted from Voisijt, 1817, whose work Leslie

met with at Paris in 1819. There is also given, facing p. 208, a large folding

sheet, containing an enlarged multiplication table, exhibiting products from

11x11 to 99x9 9, the table being of triangular form. There are also, on

the same sheet, two smaller tables, the fii'st giving squares, cubes, square

roots (to seven places), cube roots (to six places), and reciprocals (to seven

places) of numbers from 1 to 100, and the second being a small m.ultiplication

table from 2 x 2 to 25 x 25. In the first edition (1817, pp. 240) the quarter-

square table does not appear ; and in the folding sheet (which follows the

arc given in the other small table.

only depend on the last two figures of the number, are given once for all

on two slips bound up to face pp. 2 & 41.
   TuU rules are given as to how to use the table as a table of squares ; and

three small tables are added, by means of which the square of any number

of five figures can be found tolerably easily. The arguments are printed

in red.

   In his prefiice Centnerschwer states that after his work was in the press,
lie received from C'relle a table, by J. A. P. Burger, entitled " Tafeln zur

Erleichtcrung in Eechnungen," Karlsruhe, 1817, in wbich the author claims

to be inventor of the method, while Centnerschwer states it was known to

LuDOLF (1690), and even Euclid. That Ludolf was the inventor of the
method is true ; and there is attached to his work a table of squares to

100,000 (see Ludolf, § 3, art. 4).

   The full title of Biirger's work, which we have not been successful in ob-

--taining a sight of, is (after Hogg) as follows : " Tafeln zur Erleichtcrung in

(fifth) figure in the left-hand column, is given the quarter square required.

The quarter squares are printed in groups of three figures, the second group

previous works on the subject of quarter squares.

The arrangement is rs in a seven-figure logarithm table ; viz. the first four

figures are found in the left-hand column, and the fifth in the top row ; the
three or four figures common to the block of figures are also separated as in

logarithmic tables, and the change in the fourth or fifth figure is denoted by
an asterisk prefixed to all the quarter squares affected : at the extreme left
of each page is a column of corresponding degrees, minutes, and seconds

of the page arc differences (contracted by the omission of the last two figures)

and proportional parts. The figures are very clear ; and there is a full intro-
duction, with explanations of the use, &c. of the tables.

    Mr. Laundy was induced to construct his tabic by Prof. Sjdvester's paper
in vol. iv. of the 'Assurance Magazine,' referred to above ; and a description
of the mode of construction &c. of the table (most of which is also incor-

porated in the introduction to it) is given in vol. vi. of the ' Assurance

Magazine.'

          Art. 4. Tables of Squares, Cubes, Square roots, and Cube roots.

    Tables of squares (or square roots of square numbers) are of nearly as

great antiquity as multiplication tables, and would, wc think, be found to be
rather common in early manuscripts on arithmetic. They are, as a role, but

slightly noticed in histories of the subject (see references in § 3, art. 1), partly

because the latter are very meagre, and very many manuscripts remain still

unexamined, and partly because it is rather the province of a history to de-
scribe the improvement of processes. The perfection of the methods of ex-
tracting the square root of numbers not complete squares, however, occupies

a conspicuous place.

   In the MSS. Gg. ii. 33 of the Cambridge University Library, are two frag-
ments, one of Theodorus Meletiniotes, the second of Isaac Argyrus (botb much of
the same date, time of John Palaeologus, 1360) (concerning the first, see Vin-
cent, Manuscrit de la Bibliotheque Imperiale, xix. pt. 2. p. 6). The fragment
is a portion of the first book, and contains rules and small tables for multi-

plication, fractional computation &c.

   The tract of Isaac Argyrus is entitled " tov 'Apyvpou evpeffis rwy Terpayw-

riKiJii}' TrXevpdJi' tiLv fxt) prjrwi' uptdjjiiiijy.

    At the end there is a table of the square roots of all integral numbers from
1 to 120, in sexagesimal notation. The table is prepared as if for three
places of sexagesimals ; but usually two only are perfect. Errors (probably
due to the copyist) are frequent. Before the table is a description of the
method of its use, including an explanation of the method of proportional

parts.

   De Morgan speaks of two early (printed) tables in Pacioli's ' Summa,'
1494, and by Cosmo Bartoli, 1564, extending respectively to the squares of
100 and 661. The tables which we have examined are described below; but
there are several of some extent, which De Morgan refers to, that we have not

--seen, viz. : Guldinus, 1635, squares and cubes to those of 10,000 ; AY. Hunt,

1687, squares to that of 10,000 ; and J. P. Biichner's ' Tabula Radicum,'
Nuremberg, 1701, which gives squares and cubes up to 'that of 12,000 (full
title given in Eogg). Lambeet (Introd. ad Suppl. &c. 1798) says that
Biichner's table is " j^lena errorum." Eogg gives the title " Bobert, K. W.,
Tafeln der Quadratzahlen aller natiii-lichen Zahlen von 1-25,200 ; der Kubik-

zahlenvon 1-1200; der Quadrat- u.Cubicwurzeln von 1-1000. Neu berechnet,
Leipzig, 1812 ;" and the title occurs in the Eoy. Soc. Lib. Cat. (though the
book is not to be found in the Library). De Morgan mentions " Schiert,
'Tafeln,' &c. Eohn om Eheim, 1827," as giving squares to 10,000, which is

no doubt a misprint for " Schiereck, J. F., Tafeln aller Quadrate von 1 bis

10,000. 4to. Koln am Ithein, 1827," which occurs in the Babbage Catalogue,
and also in Eogg. From the title of another work of Schiercck's given in

the former catalogue, it appears that the table of squares also appeared as an
appendix to his ' Handbuch fiir Geometer,' published in the same year.

   De Morgan speaks of Ludolf's ' Tetragonometria,' 1090, which gives

squares up to that of 100,000, " as being the largest in existence, and very
--26 REPOiiT 1873.

little known." This is true ; but Kulik, 1848, is of the same extent, and

also gives cubes vp to that of 100,000, thus giving the largest table of squares,
and by far the largest table of cubes in the same work, and in a compact and

convenient form : of this work also it may be said that it is very little known.

Httttois-, 1781 (§ 4), gives squares to that of 25,400, and cubes to that of

10,000 ; but for most purposes Baelow (stereo. 1840), which gives squares,

cubes, and square roots and cube roots (and reciprocals) of numbers to 1000,

Weand is very accurate, is the best.   have not seen any square-root or cube-

root table of greater extent.

   Extensive tables of quarter squares have been published, which are de-
scribed in § 3, art. 3 ; and some tables of squares, as Eaa de Bruno, were
constructed with the view of being used in applying the method of least

squares.

   It is scarcely necessary to remark that logarithms find one of tlie most
valuable applications in the extraction of roots. Multiplications &c. can bo
performed generally without their aid with a little more trouble ; for finding
square and cube roots they are extremely useful ; but for the extraction of
higher roots there exists no other method admitting of convenient application.

Maginus, 1592. The ' Tabula Tetragonica ' is introduced by the words

" sequitur tabula numerorum quadratorum cum suis radicibus nunc primum

ab auctore supputata, ac in lucem aBdita," and occupies leaves 41-04. It

Wegives the squares of all numbers from 1 to 100,100.         have seen the

' Tabula Tetragonica ' quoted as an independent work ; and De Morgan says

that it was published separately, with headings and explanations in Italian

instead of Latin. In the copy before us Tavola is misprinted for Tahvla on

pp. 41 and 43 back (only the leaves are numbered).
   The work contains sines, tangents, and secants also.

   Magini was, we suppose, the vernacular name of the author, and Maginus

the same Latinized. We have somewhere seen Magini and Maginus spoken

of as if they were different persons.

Alstedius, 1649. In part 3. pp. 254-260, Alsted gives a tabic of squares

and cubes of numbers from 1 to 1000. Alsted's is the first Cyclopaedia, in

the sense that we now understand the word.

[Moore, Sir Jonas, 1650?] Squares and cubes of numbers from 1 to

1000, fourth powers from 1 to 300, fifth and sixth powers from 1 to 200.

In the book before us (Brit. Mus.) this tract (which has a separate pagina-

tion) is bound up at the end, after Moore's 'Arithmetick (and Algebra),

Contemplationes Geometricoe, and Conical Sections.' De Morgan says that

power tables, exactly the same as these, were given in Jonas Moore's ' Arith-

metic ' of 1650, and reprinted in the edition of 1660 ; so that probably the

tract noticed here usually formed part of the 'Arithmetick.'

   [Pell], 1672. Squares of numbers from 1 to 10,000 (pp. 29). This is
followed by the 6 one-figure endings, the 22 two-figure endings, the 159

three-figure endings, and the 1044 four-figure endings, which square numbefs

admit of. They are given at length, and also in a synoptical form. The last

page in the Eoy. Soc. copy is signed John Pell. (In the Itoyal Society's Li-

brary Catalogue this table is entered under Fell, the signature at the end in

the Society's copy having been struck out so as to render the first letter

uncertain.)

In the Brit. Mus. is a copy without any name (so that perhaps Pell's name

was supplied in the Eoy. Soc. copy only in manuscript). ' Dr. Poll's Tables,'

however, is written in it, and no doubt can exist about its authorship.
                 ON MATHEMATICAL TABLES.                                27

Ludolf, 1690. Squares of all numbers from ixnity to 100,000, arranged

in columns, so that the first three or four figures of the root are to be found at

the top of the column, while the final ones are given in the left-hand column of

the page. The table is well printed and clear, and, except Kulik, 1848,

which is of the same extent, is the largest table of squares that has been

published, and occupies about 420 pages. Some errata in it are given at

the end of the introduction (150 pp. in length), in which aU possible uses

of the table are explained.

Lambert (Introd. ad Supplementa, 1798) speaks of the numbers in the

table as " satis accurati." In chapter v. (pp. 48-86) (' Do Tabularum usu

sou Praxi circa Multiplicationem et Divisionem ') the use of the table as one

of quarter squares (see § 3, art. 3) is fully explained ; as squares are given

in the table, the sum and difference have to be divided by 2. llules and

examples are also added as to how to proceed when the semisum exceeds the

limits of the table by any amount ; and the processes &c. arc explained with

such fulness as to prove that all the credit of first perceiving the utility of

the method and calciilating the necessary table is due to Ludolf.

   The work is said to be very scarce ; biit we have seen several copies ; there

is one in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge, and another in the

Graves Library.

Heilbronner (under Herwart ab Hohenbtjrg) mentions Ludolf (Hist. Math.

p. 827), and (referring doubtless to the method of quarter squares) says that

he invented a method of performing multiplications and divisions without the

Pythagorfcan abacus, " quae prolixe ab lUustr. Wolfio in scinen Anfangs-

Griinden et suis Elementis Matheseos exjjonitur.''

Seguin, 1786. At the end of the book is given a table of the squares and

cubes of numbers from unity to 10,000. The figures have heads and tails,

and are very clear. De Morgan states that the table was reprinted at about

the beginning of the century, and that it was this table which convinced him

of the superiority of the numerals with heads and tails, aud led him in the

--reprint of Lalande's table, 1839, to adopt this figure an example Avhich has

since been very frequently followed.

As De Morgan does not appear to have seen it, it is possible that the ori-

ginal table was not reprinted, but only published separately, as the figures in

the table attached to Seguin answer De Morgan's description very well.

Barlow's tables (the stereotyped edition of 1840). Squares, cubes, square

roots, cube roots, and reciprocals to 10,000. The square roots and cube roots

are to seven places, and the reciprocals to seven significant figures, viz. nine

places to 1000, and above this ten. The work is a reprint of the more im-

portant tables in Barlow, 1814 (described in § 4) ; it was suggested by De

Morgan, who wrote the preface (2 pp.), and edited by Mr. Farley, of the

ANautical-Almanac Ofiice, who also examined carefully Barlow's tables.

list of ninety errors found in the latter is given on the page following the

preface. This reprint is, we believe, very nearly, if not quite, free from

Weerror ; it is clearly printed and much nsed,      have also an edition, 1866,

from the plates of 1840.

Kulik, 1848. The principal table occupies pp. 1-401, and gives the

squares aud cubes of all numbers //-ohi 1 to 100,000. There is a compression

resembling that in Ckelle's ' Eechentafeln ;' viz. the last four figures of the

square and cube are printed but once in each line, these figures being the

same for all squares and cubes in the same line across the double page. The

--arrangement will be rendered clear b)' the description of a page say, that

corresponding to 92, There are ten columns headed 92, 192, 292. . . .092,

each containing two vertical rows of numbers, the one corresponding to W,

iukI the other to N'; the lines are numbered 0,1,2. . . .49 (and on the next
double page 50 ... . 99). If, then, we wish to find the cube of 79217, we take
the figures 49711300i31 from column 792, lino 17, and add the last four
figures 1313 (which conclude the cube of 9217 in the same line) ; so that
the cube required is 497113061311313. Certain figures, common to the
whole or part of a column, are printed at the top, and the change in the
column is denoted by an asterisk. This is the largest table of cubes in ex-
istence, and (excei>t Ludolf, Avhich is of the same extent) is also the largest
table of squares. The printing is clear, and the book not bulky ; so that the
table can be readily used. At the end are eleven subsidiary tables. T. 1
(Perioden (jcmder Sumnienden) consists of columns marked 4, 6, 8 .... 48 at
the top, and 96, 94 .... 52 at the bottom, each containing the " complete

period " of the number in question ; thus for 42 we have 42, 84, 26, 68, 10,

&c. (these numbers being the last two figm'cs of a series of terms in arith-

metical progression, 42 being the common difference) ; and these are given
till the period is completed, i. e. till 42 occurs again. This may be at the end

of 25 or 50 additions ; if the former, the periods are given commencing

with 1 , 2, 3 (as well as 0) ; if the latter, with 1 or 2 only, as the case may

be; the periods for .r and 100 x are of course the same, only in reverse

order. Tlao use of the table as a means of verifying the table of squares

is obvious.

   T. 2. Primes which are the sum of two squares (these being given also)

up to 10,529.
   T. 3. Odd numbers which are the difference of two cubes (these being

given also) to 12,097.

   T. 4. Odd numbers which are the sum of two cubes (these being given also)

to 18,907.

T. 5-9. Four-figure additive and subtractive congriicnt endings for numbers

ending in 3 and 7, or 1 and 9, etc. : the more detailed description of these

tables belongs to the theory of numbers, which will form a j^art of a subse-

quent Report.

T. 10. The 1044 four-figure endings for squares, and the figures in which

the corresponding numbers must end.

   T. 11. First hundred multiples of tt and tt"^ to twelve places. There is

appended to the tables a vcrj- full description of their object and use.

   Bruno, Faa de, 1809. T. I. of this work (pp. 28) contains squares of

numbers from 0-000 to 12-000, at intervals of -001 to four places (stereo-

typed), intended for use in connexion with the method of least squares.

  We know of no work coutaiuing powers of numbers (except squares and

cubes) only. Both Hutton, 1781, and Barlow, 1814, give the first ten

powers of the first hundred numbers ; but we have seen no more extensive
table of this kind. Shanes (§ 4) gives every twelfth power of 2 as far as 2"-'

of 2 up to 2"^ Tables of compound intei-est are, in fact, merely power tables,

interest tables r has usually values from 1 to 8 or 10 at intervals of | or |

for ditfercnt periods of years ; but they could not be of much use, except for

the purpose for which they are calculated.

A good table of powers is still a desideratum, as the need for it is often

felt in mathematical calculations. Very many functions are expansible in an

+ascending (convergent) scries of the form A^-{- A^x A^.v^ -\- &c., and a de-

+scending series (generally semiconvergont) of the form B^4-Bj.i-~^4-B2.r~-

itc. The former is usually very convenient for calculation when x is small,

and the latter when x is large ; but between the two, for values of :c included

between certain limits above unitj', there will be an interval where neither

--series is suitable the ascending series because the terms x, x"^,. . . . (x >1)

increase so fast that n must be taken very large (t. e. very many terms must

be included) before A,, is so small that A,,.r" can be neglected, and the de-

scending series because it begins to diverge before it has yielded as many

decimals as are required. For these intermediate values the former series

(if there is no continued fraction available) must be used ; and then the terms

begin by increasing, often so rapidly, if x bo moderately large, that it may be

necessary to calculate some of them to fifteen or twenty figures to obtain a

correct value for the function to only seven or eight decimals. In these

cases, so long as ten figures only are   wanted, logarithms are                     employed                                            but
                                                                                                                                     ;

when more are required recourse must be had to simple arithmetic ; and it is

then that a power table is so much needed. Mr. J. "W. L. Glaisher has had

formed in duplicate a table giving the first twelve powers of the first thousand

numbers, which, after the calculation has been made independently a third

time, will be stereotyped and published, probably in the course of 1873 ; it is

hoped that it will help to make the tabulation of mathematical functions

somewhat less laborious and difficult.

less than unity whose denominator does not exceed three figures, nor its nu-
merator two, to seven places of decimals. It is arranged by numerators
that is, all fractions of one numerator are upon one double page." Eecipro-
cals would property be included in this article ; but from their more frequent
use they have been jjlaccd in an article by themselves (§ 3, art. 7) ; Picabte's

table in that article gives multiples of reciprocals.

occupies pp. 412-434 of vol. ii. of ' Carl Friedrich Gauss Werke,' Gottingen,

In it, among other things, the reciprocal of every prime less than 1000 is
given completeh/ (i. e. till the figures circulate). Had we met with the table

selves hei'e to giving the reference, reserving a more detailed explanation for

--at length a curious mode of statement at the end of a book occupied with

decimal fractions.

   Goodwyn's Tables, 1816-1S23. It is convenient to describe Good-

wyn's four works (the titles of which are given at length in § 5) together, as
they all relate to the same subject.

   The Tahidar Series of Decimal Quotients (1823) forms a handsome table of
153 pages, and gives to eight places the decimal corresponding to every vulgar
fraction less than ^^j, whose numerator and denominator are both not greater
than 1000. The arguments are not arranged according to their numerators or

denominators, but according to their magnitude, so that the tabular results

exhibit a steady increase from -001 (= xu\rLr)to -09989909 (= JJL). The

author intended the table to include all fractions whose numerators and deno-
minators were both less than 1000 without restriction ; and at the end of the

book is printed " End of Part I. ; " but no more was ever published.

   The arrangement of the arguments in order of magnitude is not very good,
as it requires the first two figures of the decimal to be known in order to know
where to look for it in the table ; the table would be more useful if it were re-
quired to find a vulgar fraction (with not more than three figures in numerator
or denominator) nearly equal to a given decimal*; but this is not a trans-
formation that is often wanted. "When the decimal circulates and its period
is completed within the first eight figures, points are placed over the first and
last figures of the period, if not, of course only over the first; and by means
of the same author's table of ' Circles ' described boloM", the period can be
easily completed, and the whole decimal fraction found. The fractions which
form the arguments are given in their lowest terms.

   The Table of Circles (1823) gives all the periods of the circulating decimals
that can arise from the division of any integer by another integer less than

1024. Thus for 13 we find -076923 and -1 53846, which are the only periods

in which the fraction I- can circulate.

   The periods for denominator 2" 5"' x are evidently the same as those for
denominator x; and arguments of this form are therefore omitted ; but a table is

given at the end (pp. 110 and 111), showing whether for any denominator loss

than 1024 the decimal ( 1 ) terminates, and is therefore not included in the table,
(2) is in the table as it stands, or (3) is in the table but has to be sought
under a different argument (these last being numbers of the form 2» 5'" .r).

A third table (p. 112) also gives the' number of places after the sejyaratrix

(decimal point) at which the period commences.

   The principal table occupies 107 ])p. Some of the numbers are very long,
(e. g., for 1021 there are 1020 figui-es in the period), and are printed in lines of
difterent lengths, giving a very odd ai^pearance to many of the pagesf.

  A table at the end contains all numbers of the form 2" 5"' that are less than

* It is proper to note, however, that the table was no doubt calculated for this purpose

the author considered his 'Table of Circles ' as giving decimals to vulgar fractions, and in-

tended this table to give vulgar fractions to decimals (see the introduction to the second

part of the  ' Centenary                                                 1816) ;  the  ' Tabular Series '  (181C)  is complementary to the  ' Cen-
                                                                      '

tenary ;' but not so the ' Tabular Series' (1823) to the ' Table of Circles ' (1823), as the

latter only gives the periods.

   t If the period of a decimal consists of an even number of figures, it is well known

that the figures in the last half ai-e the complements to nine of tlie figures in the first
lialf; and tlie periods have been printed so that the comiilementary figures should bo under

one another. When the period is odd, there is always anollicr period of eoraplementary

figures, and the two are printed one under the other ; these facts account for wliat at first
siglit appears a capricious arrangement of the figures.

1,000,000, arranged in order of magnitude, with the values of n and m, and also
the values of the reciprocals of the numbers (expressed as decimals) and the
total number of the proper vulgar fractions in their lowest terms which can

arise for any of the arguments as denominator. An example of the use of

the tables is given at the end of the book.
   The First Centenary Sfc. [1816] contains the factors of all numbers to 100,

and the complete periods of their reciprocals or multiples of theii- reciprocals,
also the first six figures of every decimal fraction equivalent to a vulgar frac-
tion whose denominator is equal to the argument. The following is a spe-
cimen of one of the tables :

" In ail}' three consecutive vulgar fractions in the table, if the numerators of

the extremes and the denominators be added together, the sum will form the
numerator and denominator of a fraction equal to the mean." That this is
the case with all fractions, ranged in order, whose numerators and denomi-
nators are integers less than given integers, is a theorem discovered by Cauchy
and published by him in his ' Exercices.'

   It has been thought worth while to describe Goodwyn's works at some
length, as they are almost unique of their kind, and are rarely to be met

with.

   De Morgan states that " Mr. Goodwyn's manuscripts, an enormous mass
of similar calculations, came into the possession of Dr. Olinthus Gregory,
and were purchased by the Eoyal Society at the sale of his books in 1842."'

There is no mention of them, however, in the lloyal Society's Catalogue of

MSS. ; and nothing is known of them at the Society. They may possibly be

brought to light in the rearrangement of the manuscripts consequent upon the
approaching change of rooms.

                            Art. 7. Tables of Mecijirocals.

The most extensive table is

Oakes, 1865. Reciprocals from 1 to 100,000. This table gives seven figures

of the reciprocal, and  is  arranged  as  in  tables of seven-figure  logarithms                                                viz.
                                                                                                                             ;

the first four figures are found in the column at the left-hand side of the page,

the fifth figures run along the top line, and the sixth and seventh are inter-

polated for by proportional parts. The reciprocal of a number of five figures

is therefore taken out at once, and the process of taking out a recipi'ocal is

exactly similar to that of taking out a logarithm.

From 10,000 to 22,500 the differences and proportional parts (being

numerous) are placed on the lower half of the page, the differences being

also placed at the side of each line ; but above 22,500 the differences and

proportional parts are placed at the side of the page as in tables of logarithms.

The figures have heads and tails ; and the change in the third figure of the

reciprocal is made evident by prefixing an asterisk to the succeeding numbers

in the line. The table is the result of an original calculation, and was con-

structed by means of the obvious theorem that the difference of two recipro-

cals, divided by the difference of the corresponding numbers, is the reciprocal

of the product of those numbers. The reciprocals of the highei' numbers,

however, were calculated by differences, which difterences were found by

logarithms. Various checks were applied ; and the whole was virtually re-

computed on the Arithmometer of M. Thomas de Colmar. The significant

figures of the reciprocals alone are tabulated, decimal points and ciphers

being omitted, for the same reason that characteristics are left out in loga-

rithmic tables.

   In T. I. of Baelow (§ 4) reciprocals are given of numbers from 1 to 10,000 ;
and this table also appears in the stereotype reprint of 1840 (see § 3, art. 4) :

the latter is the most generally used table of reciprocals, and is of sufficient
extent for most purposes ; it is also reputed to be very accurate, and is perhaps

free from error.
   It must be added that Goodwyn's ' Table of Circles,' and ' Tabular Series,'

&c., 1823 (§ 3, art. 6), give reciprocals of numbers less than 1024 complete;
viz. the whole period is given, even where it exceeds a thousand figures.

article (§ 3, art. 6).

the reciprocals, but also multiples of them), wo here describe Picarte's ' La

Division reduite a une Addition.'

Ficarte [18G1], The principal table occnpies pp. 15-104, and gives, to ten

significant figures, the reciprocals of all numbers from 1000 to 10,000, and also

the first nine multiples of the latter (which are therefore given to 10 or 11 sig-

nificant figures). It is easy to see how this table reduces Division to Addition.

The arguments run down the left-hand column of the page ; and there are niuo

other columns for the multiples ; each page contains 100 lines ; so that there

are 10,300 figures to the page. Owing, however, to its size, and to the smallness

and clearness of the figures, there is no confusion, the lines being well leaded.

The great table is preceded by two smaller ones, the first of which (pp. 6, 7)

gives the figures from the ninth to the fourteenth (inclusive) of the logarithms

of the numbers from 101,000 to 100,409 at intervals of unity (downwards),

with first, second, and third differences ; and the second (pp. 10, 11) gives
ten-figure logarithms of numbers to 1000 ; and from 100,000 to 101,000 at in-

tervals of unity (with differences). There is also some explanation &c.

about the manner of calculating logarithms by interpolation, &c. The

author remarks on the increasing rarity of ten-figure tables of logarithms,

referring, of course, to Vlacq and Vega. The whole work was submitted by

its author to the French Academy, and reported on favourably by a Commit-

tee consisting of MM. Mathieu, Hermite, and Bienayme. The report (made

to the Academy Feb. 14, 1859) is printed at the beginning of the work.
M. Eamon Picarto describes himself as Member of the University of Chili

and the Chilian Government subscribed for 300 copies of the work. There

is no date ; but the "privilege" is dated ISTov. 1860, and the book was re-

ceived at the British Museum, April 29, 1861, so that the date we have

assigned is no doubt correct. On the cover of the book are advertised the

following tables by the same author, which we have not seen :

   " Tables de multiplication, contenant les produits par 1, 2, 3 .... 9 et toutes

les quantites au-dessous de 10,000, 1 vol. in-l8 jesus."
   " Tableau Pithagoriqiie, etendu jusqu'a 100 par 100, sous une nouveUe

forme qui a permis de suppriraer la moitie dcs produits."

It is scarcely necessary to remark that any trigonometrical table giving

sines and cosecants, cosines and secants, or tangents and cotangents, may bo

used (and sometimes with advantage) as a table of reciprocals. The extreme

facility with which reciprocals can be found by logarithms has prevented tables

of the fonner from being used or appreciated as much as they deserve.

   If a number is given, and it is required to determine whether it be prime,
and if not what are its factors, there is no other way of effecting this ex-
cept by the simple and laborious process of dividing it by every prime less
than its square root, or until one is found that divides it without remainder*.
The construction of a tabic of divisors is on the other hand very simple, as it

+* Wilson's theorem (viz. that 1 . 2 . 3. ...(«- 1)  1 is or is not divisible by n,

according as n is or is not prime) theoretically affords a criterion ; b-at the labour of

is merely necessary to form the miiltiples of 2, 3, 5 . . up to the extent of the
table, the numbers that do not occur being of course primes. The manner
in which the formation of these multiples is best effected, and other practi-
cal details, are explained by Bueckhaedt in his preface to the second
million. The following is a Hst of tables of divisors and of primes, abridged
from an elaborate account prefixed to Cheriiac :

1657. Francis Schooten : table of primes to 9997.

1668. Pell (in Branker's translation of Rhonius's ' Algebra,' iniblished at

London)                                               least divisors of odd numbers not ending in 5 to 100,U00.

1728. Poetius. An ' anatome' of numbers to 10,000.

1746. KEtJGEE. Primes to 100,999.

   1767. Anjema. All divisors (simple and compound) of numbers to

10,000.

   1770. Lambeet. Least divisors of numbers to 102,000 (multiples of 2, 3,
and 5 omitted).

   1772. Marci. Extension of Lambert's table by the addition of primes to

400,000.

1785. Neumann. Simple divisors (Pell only gave the least) of numbers

to 100,100 (multiples of 2, 3, 5 omitted).

   1797. Vega. Simple factors to 102,000, and 'primes to 400,000 (seo
Yega, ' Tabula;,' 1797, Vol. II. T. I.).

    1804. Krause. Factor table to 100,000.

   From the above list Chernac has omitted Rahn (1659), giving factors to

24,000, and Pigri (1758) to 10,000, which are described below. A more

important omission. is that of Felkel, whose table is noticed at length

further on.

 --The titles of Anjema's, Neumann's, and Krause's works are given in the

Babbage Catalogue as follows : " Anjema (Henricus), Tabula divisorum

omnium numerorum naturalium ab 1 usque ad 10000. 4to, Lugd. Bat.

Factoren- und Primzahlen-Tafel von 1 bis 100000 neu berechnet. Fol.

   The same catalogue also contains the title, " Snell (F. W. D.), Ueber cine
neue und bequeme Art, die Faktorentafeln einzurichten, nebst einer Kup-

fcrtafel der einfachen Faktoren von 1 bis 30000. 4to. Giessen und Darm-

stadt, 1800."

   The following are accounts of tables we have seen :
   Rahn, 1659. On pp. 37-48 is given a table of divisors; viz. the least

divisor of every number, not divisible by 2 or 5, is tabulated from 1 to 24,000,
the primes being marked with a p.

   Pigri, 1758. All the simple factors (so that if multiplied together they

give the number) are given of all numbers from 1 to 10,000. When the

= = =number is a power, letters are used instead of numbers (a 2,b 3,c 5,

&c., as explained on p. 11 of the book) ; thus, answering to 25 Ave have cc,
to 27 hhh, to 225 bh, cc, &c.

   Kriiger, 1746. At the end of the ' Algebra ' is a list of primes to 100,999,
arranged consecutively in pages of six columns, and occupying 47 pp. The
titlepage runs ' Primzahlcn von 1 bis 1000000' ; but the limit is as above

stated ; and there is no possibility that the copy before us is incomplete, as the
last page is a short one, and there is no printing on the back.

                                                                                                            1)2
--36 REPoiiT 1873.

   The primes of each hundred are separated, which for some purposes would

be an advantage.
   LiMBERT states (Introd. ad ' Supplemental &c., 1798) that Kruger received

this table from Peter Jaeger.
   Felkel, 1776. Table of all simple factors of numbers to 144,000, the

Atabular results being obtained from three tables. Thus Table gives primes

to 20,.353 ; these occupy one page, along the top line of which run the Greek
letters o, /3 . . . . and down the left-hand column four alphabets consecutivel}-,
viz. small italic, small German, capital italic, and capital Gorman (there
being 100 lines); and any prime given on this page is henceforth in the book
denoted by its coordinates, so to speak : thus 9839 would be printed yu^i, &e.

The principal table occupies 24 pp. ; and then Table B occupies one page at
the end. Suppose it required to find the factors of 1.38, .593. The middle
table is entered at 138 and Table E at 593. In tlie latter we find as result
" g line 20," so that we know that the compartment under ^ in the 20th line of
the block 138, refers to the number in question. In this compartment is printed

e, g, (3x, which, interpreted by Table A, gives 7, 13, and 1523 as the factors.
There are a few details that have been omitted in this description ; the last
three figures are written in the compartment wherever there is room for

them.

   On the titlepage is a large engraving of a student (no doubt a portrait of

Felkel) turning in contempt from a disordered cabinet of military books to

another neatly arranged, containing Euler, Newton, Maclaurin, Bernoulli,
Boscovich, &c., and holding in his hand the works of Lambert ; with mottoes
" Bella odi, Pacem diligo, vera soqiior," &c. above. It will be seen that this
table is entirely superseded by Chernac and Burckhardt. In the arrangement

of the latter the table would only have occupied 16 much smaller pages,

and its use would have required no explauation ; but on account of the rarity
of the work, it has been thought worth while to describe at some length

what is certainly the most remarkable-looking table we have seen.
   De Morgan states that " Murhard mentions the first part of a table (by

A. Pelkel) of the factors of all numbers not divisible by 2, 3 or 5 from 1 to a

hundred millions, Vienna (1776)." On referring to Murhard we find such is
the case, " 100,000,000 " being an obvious misprint for " 10,000,000 ; " wo

have seen Murhard's error reproduced by other writers.
   Of Felkel's table Gauss (in the letter prefixed to Base's Seventh Million)

says : " Felkel hatte die Tafel im Mauuscripte bis 2 Millionen fertig und der
Druck war bis 408,000 fortgeschritten, daun aber sistirt, und die ganze
Anflage wurde vernichtet bis auf wenige Exeraplare des bis 336,000 geheuden
Theils, woven die hicsige Bibliothek eines besitzt." The copy of Felkel in
the Eoyal Society's Library, which extends to 144,000, is that which has
been described above. Felkel's table is also referred to by Hobert and
Ideler in the introduction to their work (see § 4).

    Felkel was editor of the Latin edition (Lisbon, 179S) of Lambert's
'Zusiitze' (the ' Supplemcnta' &c., see § 4) ; and he has there given, in the
' Introductio Interpretis ' and at the end, some account of his life and the work
he accomplished and hoped to accomplish with regard to the theory of numbers.

He commenced the study of mathematics when of a somewhat advanced age
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

and he speaks in the warmest terms of Lambert, with whom he was in cor-
respondence, and from whom he derived much assistance. This accounts for

Lambert being the book open before the student in the engraving described

above.

    In a note on p. siv of the Introductio to the ' Supplemental he (Felkel)
ON MATHEMATICAL TABLES,  37

says : " Non solum iiiveni formam omnes divisores nuraerorum excepto maxi-

mo, ab 1 usque 1,008,000 in spatio 42 plagularum rcprffiscntandi, vcruni etiam
rcipsa opus spatio 16 meusium usque ad 2,016,000 coiifeci, annoque 1785
.... ad 5,000,000 usque continuavi." (See also p. yII of the ' Introductio lu-

tcrpretis ').

    Since writing the above description of Felkel, I have examined (in the
Graves Library) a far more complete copy, which contains probably all that
Tclkel ever printed. There are three parts (bound together). The first is the
same as that described above, and extends to 144,000 ; the second part

(with fresh pagination) extends from 144,001 to 336,000 (pp. 2-03) ; we
then have 'Tabula Factorum pars III exhibens factores numerorum ab
336,001 usque 408,000,' occupying pp. 65-87. The table thus gives factors
as far as 408,000. The words " 336,001 usque 408,000 " have clearly ori-

ginally stood " 144,001 usque 366,000 ;" but the latter numbers have been
stamped out and the former printed over them. There is a note in the work

--in the handwriting of Mr. Graves's librarian, which, referring to Gauss's

remark quoted above, proceeds : " This copy contains 3 parts and gives the
factors of all numbers up to 408,000 ; such a copy is perhaps unique."
Gauss stated that all the copies were destroyed except a few, which extended
to 330,000 ; so that there can be no doubt that tlie Graves copy, extending

to 408,000, must be, to say the least, excessively rare.
    It should be added that the title and preface to the Graves copy are in

Latin, while the lloyal Society's copy has them in German (Poggendorff
also quotes the title in German with date 1777) ; the preface is dated April 1,
1777, although the titlepage bears date 1776. In the Graves copy some

errata in Part I. are given.
   For several reasons Felkel's connexion with numerical tables is a curious

one, and the record of his life would be interesting. "VVe have seen (in some
work of reference) a number of mechanical contrivances assigned to him as

their inventor.

   Chernac, 1811. In a thick quarto are given all the simple divisors of

numbers from 1 to 1,020,000 (multiples of 2, 3, and 5 being excluded).
This book was found by Burckhardt (who subsequently published the same
table, the least divisor only being given) to be very acciu-ate ; he detected only
38 errors (he has given them in the preface to his first million), of which only
9 are due to the author, the remaining 29 having been caused by the slipping

&c. of type in the printing.

   Hutton's Phil, and Math. Diet. 1815. In vol. ii. pp. 236-238 (Art.

' Prime Numbers ') is a table giving the least divisor of all numbers from 1 to

10,000, multiples of 2 and 5 being omitted.

   Burckhardt (First Million), 1817. Least divisors of every number to

1,020,000. The library of the Institute contained a manuscript (calculated
by Schenmarck ?) giving the least divisor of numbers to 1,008,000 ; Burck-
hardt therefore computed the next 12,000 himself, and compared the manu-

--script with Cheenac a laborious work, as when a wrong divisor was given,

Burckhardt had to satisfy himself if the number was really prime, as was
the case in 236 instances. For primes less than 400,000 he referred to Ycga

(see Vega's ' Tabula,' 1797, Vol. II. T, I., and Hulsse's Jega, 1840, T. V.).

Ojily 38 errors were found in Chebnac. On the last page is a small table con-
taining the number of figures in the periods of the reciprocals of 794 primes

below 9901 (779 of which are below 3000). Burckhardt mentions in the preface
that he has nearly completed the manuscript of the fourth, fifth, and sixth

millions, which will be published, if the sale of the first three millions is
as EEPORT--1873.

sufficiently favourable to induce the bookseller to undertake them. There

are three pages on the use of the tables. This work, though containing the

first million, was published after the second and third.

Five errors are pointed out at the beginning of Case's ' Seventh Million.'

Burckhardt (Second Million), 1814. The arrangement is the same as for

the first million ; and the table extends from 1,020,000 to 2,028,000. This

was the first published of the three millions ; and the method of calculation &c.

is explained in the introduction, the least factor alone being given. If the

others are required, the process is of course to divide the number by this factor

and enter the table again with the quotient. To facilitate the division, on

the first page (p. viii) a table is given of the first 9 multiples of all primes

to 1423.

Burckhardt (Third Million), 1816. The arrangement is the same as in

the other millions : the table extends from 2,028,000 to 3,036,000.

Rees'sCyclop8edia(vol.xxviii. Art. 'Prime Numbers'), 1819. Attached

to the article "Prime Numbers" in liees's ' Cyclopfcdia,' is a table of 23 pp.,

--giving a list of primes up to 217,219 arranged in decades a very convenient

table, as there are 910 primes on each page. It is stated (and truly) that the

primes are given to twice the extent that they are to be found in any previous

English work. In the course of the article the author says, "And a work lately

published in Holland, not only contains the prime numbers up to ] ,000,000,

--but also the factors of all composite numbers to the same extent a performance

which, it must be allowed, displays the industry of its author to much more

advantage than either his genius or judgement." Tliis can only refer to Chbh-
NAc's table, which was published at Dcvcnter (Davcntria) in 1811 ; and it is a
matter of regret that an English writer on mathematics should have thought

only deserving of a sneer a work the performance and extension of which

had been consistently urged by Euler and Lambert and afterwards by Gauss.
One would expect the article of such a writer on the theoiy of numbers to bo

very poor ; and such is the case. He has not thought it worth while to

state where the table he gives has been copied from ; it is no doubt taken
from Vega (' Tabulje '), 1797, Vol. II. T. I.

   Dase (Seventh Million), 1862. The least divisor of all numbers from

6,000,001 to 7,002,000 (multiples of 2, 3 and 5 excluded), and therefore

also a table of primes between these limits.

The arrangement is as in Bueckhaedt, there being 9000 numbers to the

page.

This work was undertaken by Dase at the suggestion of Gauss ; and the letter

of the latter is printed in the preface. In it Gauss adverts to, and expresses
his concurrence in, Felkel's desire Ihat the factorial tables should be extended

to ten millions ; he states that a manuscript containing the fourth, fifth, and

sixth millions (viz. 3,000,000 to 6,000,000) was some years before presented
by Crelle to the Berlin Academy, and he expresses a hope that it will soon be

jrablished ; he therefore suggests that Dase should complete the portion
from 6,000,000 to 10,000,000. Dase accordingly undertook the Avork, and

at the time of his death in 1862 had finished the seventh miUion entirely

and the eighth million nearly ; while many factors for the ninth and tenth

millions had been determined. The seventh million (as also the two follow-

ing) were published after Dase's death by a committee of his fellow-towns-

men as a memorial of his talent for calculation.

Dase (Eighth MiUion), 1863. The arrangement is the same as in the

seventh   million                        and  the  table extends from 7,002,001 to  8,010,000 ;  the
                                      ;

paging runs from 113 to 224.

                        ON MATHEMATICAL TABLES.                                                                                89

   There is a short preface of 2 pp. by Dr. Eosenberg, who edited the work,
which was left nearly complete by Dase.

   Dase and Rosenberg (Ninth Million), 1865. The arrangement is the

same as in the pre\doiis two millions ; and the table extends from 8,010,000
to 9,000,000. The work left incomplete by Dase at his death was finished
by Dr. Rosenberg ; the paging runs from 225-334.

   It is stated in the preface that the tenth million (the last which the tables

were intended to include) was nearly completed ; but we believe it has not

yet appeared.

It will have been seen from the above accounts that CnERNAc's, Btjeck-

haedt's, and Dase's tables together contain all the published results with re-

gard to factors of numbers ; and by means of them we can find aU the

simple divisors of numbers between one million and three millions and

between six millions and nine millions easily, and between unity and one

million at sight. There is, however, the gap from three millions to six

millions ; and it is very much to be regretted that this is not filled up.

Gauss states a table of divisors from three millions to six millions exists in

manuscript at Berlin ;  and Eurckhardt also formed  a  similar table                                                       so  that
                                                                                                                        ;

this portion has apparently been twice calculated (by Crelle ? and Eurck-

hardt).

    Gauss's letter is dated 1850 ; and it is a calamity that the anticipations con-
tained in it have not been realized, as a manuscript unpublished does more
liarm than if it were non-existent, by checking others from attempting the
task. The completion of Gauss's scheme (viz. the publication of tables to ten

millions) is very desirable, as these tables may be regarded as data in regard

to investigations in the theory of numbers (see references to memoirs of Euler
and Gauss in Cheenac, and Gauss's letter). The tenth million also seems to

be still unpublished, though seven years ago we had Dr. Eosenberg's assurance
that it was nearly completed. If the whole ten millions were published, we
should much like to see a list of all the primes up to this point published

separately.

   Oakes, 1865 (Machine table). The object is to find the prime or least

factors of numbers less than 100,000 ; and for this purpose there are three

Atables, (1 page large 8vo), E (4 pp. folio), and C (1 page obi. folio), and

nine perforated cards, the one to be employed depending on the group of
10,000 that contains the argument. The mode of entry is somewhat compli-
cated ; and the table can only be regarded as a matter of curiosity ; for in the
method of arrangement of Eurckhasdt or Dase the least factors of aU

--numbers under 100,000 only occupy a little over 11 pp. or six leaves

of small folio or large 8vo size while the present apparatus consists of six
leaves of large and diiferent sizes, and nine cards, besides requiring an

involved course of procedure. Col. Oakes does not explain the principle

on which his method depends.

                       Art. 9. Sexagesimal and Sexcentenary Tables.

    Originally all calculations were sexagesimal ; and the relics of the sj'stem
still exist in the division of the degree into 60 minutes, and the minute into
60 seconds. To facilitate interpolation, therefore, in trigonometrical and
other tables, several large sexagesimal tables have been constructed, which

--are described or referred to below. They are, we believe, scarcely used at

all now, for several reasons first, on account of the somewhat cumbrous size
of the complete tables, and secondly because for most purposes logistic

Alogarithms (see § 3, art. 18) are found more expeditious and convenient.

third reason is that both Eernotjlli's and Taylor's tables were published by
the Commissioners of Longitude, and, like the other publications of the Board,
were advertised so little that their existence never became generally known.

ABernoulli, 1779.  sexcentenary table to 600 seconds, to every second,

giving at once the fourth term of any proportion of which the first term is

·600" and each of the other two are less than 600". The table is, of course, of

double entry ; it may perhaps be best described as giving the value of -^~,

correct to tenths of a second, x and y each containing numbers of seconds
less than 600", .r being expressed in seconds alone, and y in minutes and
seconds (though the latter can be turned into seconds at sight, as the number
of seconds in the necessary integer number of minutes is given at the top of

--each page). The .r's run down the left-hand column, and the y's along the top

line ; and the arrangement is thus : The portion of .rfroni 1" to 60" and the
whole range of y is given ; this occupies 30 pp. ; then the portion for x from
60" to 120", and for y from 60" to 600"; and so on. The chief use of the

table consists in the fact that in astronomical tables the difi'erences are

usually given for every 10', so that the interpolation gives rise to a proportion

of the kind described above : in some cases the use of the table would be

preferable to that of logistic logarithms.

   Taylor, 1780 [T. I.] (pp. 240). The table exhibits at sight the fourth
term of any proportion where the first term is 60 minutes, the second any
number of minutes less than 60, and the third any number of minutes and
seconds xmder 60 minutes. If the second term consists of minutes and seconds,
the table must be entered twice (once for the minutes and once for the seconds).
The table can of course also be put to other uses.

    There is also added a table of the equation of second difference, giving the
correction to be applied on this account in certain cases.

    [T. II.] (pp. 250, 251). Giving the thirds answering to the decimals in
every column of [T. I.] where the result is expressed in minutes, seconds, and
decimals of a second.

   A[T. III.] (pp. 263-312). millesimal table of proportional parts adapted to

sexagesimal proportions, giving the result of any proportion in which the first
term is 60 minutes, the second term any number under 60 miimtes, and the
third term any absolute number under 1000. It is in fact the same as the
sexagesimal table [T. I.], only that the third term is expressed in seconds,
and is given only to 1000 (16' 40"), and the result is also expressed in
seconds (in [T. I.] the third terms are given both in minutes and seconds) and
-;

in seconds wholly, so that the expression of the result in seconds wholly is the

chief characteristic of [T. III.].

   This table is followed by 3 pp. to convert sexagesimals into decimals and
vice versa, and numbers into sexagesimals and vice versa. The other tables

are weights and measures &c. There are numerous examples given in the

introduction.

    [T. IV.]. Another table occupying one page (p. 252) should be noticed
it gives squares, cubes, fourth, fifth, and sixth powers of any number of
minutes up to GO' : thus the square of 3' is 9" ; the cube, 27'" ; the fourth
power 1'" 21'" ; the fifth 4'" 3% &c. The words sursolid and square cube are
used for the fifth and sixth powers.

   On the present work see also Beverley (1833?) (§ 4).
   It was the author of this table (Taylor) who afterwards calculated the

logarithmic trigonometrical canon to every second.

                    Art. 10. Tables of natural Trigonometrical Functions.

  A history of trigonometrical tables by Hutton is prefixed to all the editions

of his ' Tables of Logarithms ' published during his lifetime * ; and, in his

Article on Tables in the ' English Cyclopaedia,' De Morgan has given what

is by far the most complete and accurate account of printed tables of this
kind that has been published. Information about the earlier tables is also

to be found in Montucla and Delambre (see references in De Morgan). For
many years, when Mathematics had not passed beyond Trigonometry,

the method of construction and calculation of the * Canon Trigonometricus '
formed one of the chief objects of the science, and the works on the subject
were comparatively numerous, though now, of course, of purely historic
interest only. Prior to the introduction of sines from the Arabians by
Albategnius, trigonometrical calculations were always made by chords. The
imit-arc was the arc whose chord was equal to the radius (viz. 60°) ; and
both arc and radius were divided into 60 equal parts, and these subdivided
again into 60 parts, and so on. (It thus appears that it was not the right
angle that was divided into 90, 60 and 60 pai-ts, &c., but that the unit-angle
was 60°, so that the division was strictly sexagesimal throughout. It is

curious that in some modern tables (see Beverley, T. VI. and XV. &c.) the

original arrangement has been restored, for convenience of interpolating by
Taylor's sexagesimal table). Thus in the earliest existing table, viz. the
table of chords in the Syntaxis of Ptolemy (died a.d. 178), the chord of 90°
is 84° 51' 10". Purbach (born 1423) and llegiomontanus (born 1436) calcu-
lated sines, the former to radius 600,000 and the latter to the same radius
and also to radius 1,000,000; but it is not certain whether they were printed.
The first known printed table, according to De Morgan, is a table of sines
to minutes, without date, but previous to 1500. Peter Apian first published
a table with the radius divided decimally (1533). Tangents were first pub-

lished by Eegiomontauus (1504) ; and tho first complete canon giving all the

six ratios of the sides of a right-angled triangle is due to llheticns (1551),
-who also introduced the semiquadrantal arrangement. Eheticus's canon was

to every ten minutes to 7 places ; and Vieta first extended it to evenj minute
(1579). The first complete canon published in England was by Blundevile

(1594), although a table of sines had appeared four years earlier.

   It may be added that Eegiomontauus (1504) called his table of tangents (or

rather cotangents) Tabula foscimda, on account of its great use ; and till the in-
troduction of the word tangent by Finck (1583), a table of tangents was called

a Tabula fcecunda or Canon foecundus ; Finck also introduced the term secant,
the table of secants having previously been called Tabula benefica by Mauro-

lycus (1558), and Talula fommdissima by Yieta.
   The above historical sketch has been compiled from Hutton and De Morgan ;

so that most of tho statements contained in it arc not derived from our own

inspection of the works mentioned. It is only inteaded to give an idea of the

history of the natural canon ; and from the experience we have had of the value

of second-hand information in mathematical bibliography, we should not re-

Acommend great reliance to be placed ou any one of the facts.  good deal of

information about llheticus, Vieta, &c. is given by De Morgan, whom we have

scarcely ever found inaccurate, even in trifling details, Avhen describing works

Wehe has examined himself.  have seen several of the works noted, but not

BulRcient to make any corrections of importance to the current histories.

The next author of importance to Eheticus was Pitiscus (1G13), whose im-

portant canon, which stiU remains unsuperseded, is described below. The in-

vention of logarithms in the following year changed all the methods of calcula-

tion ; and it is worthy of note that Napier's original table of 1614 (see § 3, art.
17) was a logarithmic canon of sines and not a table of the logarithms of
numbers. Almost at once the logarithmic superseded the natural canon

and since Pixiscus's time no really extensive table of pure trigonometrical

functions has appeared. Natural canons are now most common in Nautical

collections, where the tabular results are generally given to 5 or places only.

Traverse tables (multiples of sines and cosines) have not been included

(see § 2, art. 12). Massalotjp (described below), however, is really a table

of this kind, although constructed for a different purpose.

  Finck [1583]. Canon of sines, tangents, and secants in separate tables,

quadrantally arranged, for every minute of the quadrant, to 7 decimal ])laces.
The sines occupy pp. 138-173, the tangents pp. 176-221, and the secants

pp. 224-269. De Morgan says that Finck calculated his own secants. There

is no date on the titlepage ; but the i^reface and the colophon are both dated
1583. The name tangent is introduced by Finck on p. 73, and that of
secant on p. 76. These names were speedily adopted : thus Clavius, at the
end of his edition of ' Theodosius ' (Eome, 1586), reprints Finck's tables, and
uses his terms both in the headings of the tables and in the trigonometry.

He does not mention either Finck or Eheticus by name, but speaks of them
as recentiores (p. 188). Pitiscus, in his trigonometry appended to Abraham

Shultet's ' Sphsericorum ' (Heidelberg, 1595), uses the names tangent and
secant, and refers to Finck or Eheticus for the requisite canons ; and in his

larger trigonometry (Augsburg, 1600) he reprints Finck's tables to five deci-
mals, placing the sines, tangents, and secants together in one table. Blun-
devile, in his ' Exercises ' (London, 1594), reprinted the tables from Clavius.
All these woiks are before us ; but a more detailed account would be of only

historical or bibliographical interest.
                ON MATHEMATICAL TABLES.  43

Rheticus, 1596 (' Opus Palatinum '). Complete ten-deeimal trigonome-

trical canon for every ten seconds of the quadrant, semiquadrantally arranged,

with differences for all the tabular results throughout. Sines, cosines, and

secants are given on the versos of the pages in columns headed respectively

Perjpendiculum, Basis, Hypotenusa ; and on the rectos appear tangents, cose-
cants, and cotangents, in columns headed respectively Perpendiculum, Hypo-

tenusa, Basis*. This is the celebrated canon of George Joachim llheticus,

the greatest of the table-computers, to whom also is due the canon of sines

described below under Pitiscus, 1613. At the time of his death (1576)

Rheticus left the canon all but complete ; and the trigonometry was finished

and the whole edited by Valentine Otho under the title ' Opus Palatinum,'

so- called in honour of the Elector Palatine Frederick IV., who bore the ex-

pense of publication. The edition before us is in two volumes, the second

containing the ten-decimal canon and occupying 540 pp. (2-541) folio ; then
follow 13 pp. of errata numbered 142-153 and 554. At the end of the
first volume is a canon of cosecants and cotangents (in columns headed

Hypotenusa and Basis respectively) to 7 places for every 10 seconds, in a

semiquadrantal arrangement. It occupies 180 pp. (separate pagination,

2-181) ; and there seems no reason why it should have been printed at all, as

the great ten-decimal canon completely supersedes it. Besides, it is exceed-

ingly incorrect, as comparison with the latter shows at once. On this point

De Morgan says that its insertion "was merely the editor's want of judg-

ment ; it is clearly nothing but a previous attempt made before the larger
plan was resolved on ;" while Hutton writes, " But I cannot discover the

reason for adding this less table, even if it were correct, which is far from

being the case, the numbers being uniformly erroneous and- different from the

former through the greatest part of the table." Mention of it is introduced

by Hutton with the words, " After the large canon is printed another smaller

table," &c., while in the copy before us it ends the first volume, the second

containing the great canon. It is also to be inferred from De Morgan's ac-

count that the whole work generally is bound in one (very thick) volume.

The tangents and secants in the early part of the great canon were found to

be ·inaccurate ; and the emendation of them was intrusted to Pitiscus, who

"corrected the first eighty-six pages, in which the tangents and secants were

sensibly erroneous " (De Morgan) ; and copies of this corrected portion alone

were issued separately in 1607, as well as of the whole table with the correc-

Wetions.  have not seen one of these corrected copies ; but vide De Morgan's

fuU account, ' English Cyclopaedia,' Article " Tables," and ' Notices of the

Roy. Astron. Soc.,' t. vi. p. 213, and ' Phil. Mag.' June, 1845, The pagina-
tion of the other parts of the work is ' De Triangulis globi cum angulo recto,'
pp. 3-140 ; ' De Fabi'ica Canonis,' pp. 3-85 ; ' De Triquetris rectarum line-
arum in planitie,' pp. 86-104 ; ' De Trianguhs globi sine angulo recto,' pp.
1-341 ; ' Meteoroscopium,' pp. 3-121 (the first three by Rheticus and the

rest by Otho).

In 1551 Rheticus had published a ten-minute seven-place canon in his

' Canon Doctrinae Triangulorum,' Leipzig, with which the present work must

not be confounded. And in 1579 Vieta published his ' Canon Mathematicus,
seu ad triangula cum Adpendicibus,' for every minute of the quadrant. This

   * The explanation of these terms is evident. The sines and cosines arc perpendiculars
and bases to a hypotenuse 10,000,000,000 ; the secants and tangents are hypotenuses
and perpendiculars to a base 10,000,000,000, and the cosecants and cotangents are hypo-
tenuses and bases to a perpendicular 10,009,000,000. The object Eheticus had in view
was to calculate the ratios of each pair of the sides of a right-angled triangle.

and several other works that we have examined will be noticed at length in a

future Keport.

   On Eheticns's other works see Pitiscus, 1613, below.

    Gcrnerth has given a list of 598 errors that he found in the first seven or
eight figures of the ten-decimal canon in the ' Zeitschrift f. d. osterr. Gymn.'

YI. Heft, S. 407 (also published separately). He also gives an account of the

contents of the ' Opus Palatinum,' from which it appears tliat in his copy the
difterent parts of it were bound up in a diflPerent order from that in which they

appear in the copy wc have examined (which seems to be anomalous in this
respect) ; and he omits the 121 pp. of the ' Meteoroscopium.' The great in-
accuracy of the small canon is also noticed by him ; and it is on this account

that he gives uo errata list for it.
    Pitiscus, 1613 [T. I.] (pp. 2-271, calculated by Rheticus). Natural

sines for every ten seconds throughout the quadrant, to 15 places, semiqua-
drantally arranged, with first, second, and third differences. (On p. 13, Fer-
pendkulum and Basis are printed instead of Sinus and Sinus complementi).

    [T. II.] (pp. 2-61, calculated by Rheticus). Natural sines for every
second from 0° to 1°, and from 89° to 90°, to 15 places, with first and second

diff'erences.

   [T. III. and IV.] (pp. 3-15). The lengths of the chords of a few angles,
to 25 places, with verifications &e., followed by natural sines and cosines

for the tenth, twentieth, and fiftieth second in every minute to 35', to 22

places, with first, second, third, fourth, and sometimes fifth differences.

The numbering of the pages thus recommences in each table (except. T.

IV.) ; and each has a separate titlepage. On the first two the date is printed

do . lo . XIII. instead of cIo . loc . xiii.

   The rescue of the MS. of this work from destruction by Pitiscus (as told by

himself in the preface) forms a striking episode in the history of mathematical

tables. The alterations and emendations in the earlier part of the corrected

edition of the ' Opus Palatinum ' were made by Pitiscus; and he remarked that

a table of sines to more places than ten was requisite to enable the corrections

to be conveniently made. He had his suspicions that Rheticus had himself cal-

culated a ten-second canon of sines to fifteen decimal places; and on application

to Valentine Otho, the original editor of the ' Opus Palatinum,' the latter, who

was then an old man, acknowledged that such was the case, but could not

remember where the MS. was (" ob memoriaj senilis debilitatem "). He thought

that perhaps he had left it at Wittemberg ; and accordingly Pitiscus sent a

messenger there to search for it ; but after considerable expense had been in-

curred he returned without it. After the death of Otho, when the MSS. of

Rheticus, which had been in his possession, passed into the hands of James

Christmann, the latter discovered the canon among them, when it had been

given up for lost. As soon as Pitiscus knew this he examined the MSS. page

by page, although they were in a very bad condition (situ et squalore obsitas

ac pa3ne foBtentes), and to his great satisfaction found :^(1) the ten-second

canon of sines to 15 places, with first, second, and third differences (printed

in the work under notice) ; (2) sines for every second of the first and last

degrees of the quadrant, also to             15  places, with  first and second difi'erenccs
                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

(3) the commencement of a canon of tangents and secants, to the same

number of decimal places, for every ten seconds, with first and second dif-

ferences                                     (4) a complete minute-canon of sines, tangents, and secants, also
                                          ;

to 15 decimal places. From this account, talcen in connexion with the

' Opus Palatinum ' and the contents of the present work, one is able to

form some idea of the enormous computations undertaken by Rheticus
ON MATHEMATICAL TABLES.  45

his tables not only to this day remain unsuperscded and the ultimate authori-
ties, but also formed the data whereby Vlacq calculated his logarithmic
canon. Pitiscus says that for twelve years Eheticus constantly had some com-

puters at work (duodecim totos annos semper aliquot Logistas aluit) ; and how
much labour and expense on his part would have been wasted but for the

zeal of Pitisciis is painful to contemplate ; as it was, it is matter of regret

that llheticus did not live to see the publication of either of his canons,

the first of which appeared twenty years, and the other thirty-seven years
after his death. It was Pitiscus's intention to add Eheticus's minute-canon
of tangents and secants ; but they laboured under the same defect as those in
the (uncorrected) ' Opus Palatinum,' and on this account ho was dissuaded
from so doing by Adrianus Romanus. The matter spoken of above as
[T. III. and IV.] was due to Pitiscus himself, and was introduced at the
advice of the same mathematician.

    The enormous work undertaken by Eheticus needs no eulogy ; and the
earnestness and love of accuracy displayed by Pitiscus, not only rendered
apparent by his acts but also evident in the prefaces to his several works,
will always render his an honoured name in science.

   The present work is exceedingly rare ; and the copy wc have examined is

in the library of the Greenwich Observatory. It, the ' Opus Palatinum,'
and Vlacq's ' Arithmetica Logarithmica,' 1628, and ' Trigonometria Artifici-

alis,' 1633, may be said to be the four fundamental tables of the mathemati-

 cal sciences.

    Gernerth (in the work cited under Rhexictis, 1596, supra) has given a
list of 88 errors that he detected in the first 7 or 8 places of the canon of
sines; he detected altogether 110; but 22 he states were given by Vega
in his ' Logarithmisch-trigonometrische .... Tafeln und Pormeln,' Vienna,
1783 : this was Vega's first publication of tables ; and we have not seen the
work.

   Grienberger, 1630. Sines, tangents, and secants, to 5 places, for every

minute from 0° to 45° (with foot entries also ; but the table is only half a
complete canon, as e.g. sin 50° could not be taken out from it). There are five
more figures added to the sines, but separated from them by a point (this is
not a true decimal point, as is evident from the rest of the work, where no
trace of decimals occurs), the object the author had in view in adding them

being that when the sines had to be multiplied by large numbers, the re-

sults might still be correct to the last unit (radius 100,000). Grienberger
stated that more than 35 years before (about 1595) he had calculated a
canon of sines to 1 6 places, and made considerable progress with the secants

when the ' Opus Palatinum ' appeared and caused him to lay aside his work.

This he regretted exceedingly at the time of writing the present work, as he
was not able to add the five extra figures to the tangents and secants, which

he had transferred from his MS. in the case of the sines. The ' Opus Pala-
tinum' contained enough figures; but some of them were doubtful, and he
wished no doubt to attach to any part of his table. The book is a duodecimo
volume, and would scarcely have been noticed here, but from the f;ict of j)art
of it having been the result of an original calculation. Napier's bones are
mentioned, but not logarithms. The preface contains Grienberger's 39-figure
value of TT (see ' Messenger of Mathematics,' July 1873) ; and it was in con-
nexion therewith that we sought the work out, and learnt with some surprise
of Grienberger's incomplete and unpublished calculations. The copy we
examined is in the British Museum.

book, which is intended for surveyors &c., the multiples correspond to differ-

ent lengths (1.0,1.1,.. ..50.0 Eutheu) of the hypothenuse ; and the sine

and cosine columns arc headed Rohe and Grundlinie, and are given in

lluthen. As the arguments are at intervals of a Fuss (= jL of a lluthe)

the table exhibits the results apparently to 3 places. The arrangement in
T. I. is different from that in T. II., as while in the former the lluthen and
Fiisse run down the column, and the minutes along the top line (so that aU

the multiples of the same sine or cosine are given consecutively), in T. II. the

minutes run down the column, and the Fiisse along the top line (so that the

same multiples of different angles are given consecutively). In this table also

the results are given to 3 places, if the method of statement used in the book
=be followed. As it has been assumed that a Ruthe

=quently it   12 Fuss, T. III. is given to convert decimals into duo-

decimals, or, more strictly, lluthen Decimalmaass into Werkmaass and

Bergmaass.

   T. I. and II. are of course simple traverse tables.

   Junge, 18(34. Natural sines and cosines for every ten seconds of the
quadrant to G places. The table is one of the clearest we have seen, the

figures being distinct, and plenty of space being left between the columns
&c., so as to give a light appearance to the page, though its large size is
rather a disadvantage. The tabular results were interpolated for by Thomas's
calculating machine from the natural sines in Ht/lsse's tables ; and the last

figure may bo in error by rather more than half a unit. The connexion

between the tables and Thomas's machine, referred to in the title and in the

--preface, merely amounts, we suppose, to this that Avhilo' computers in

general use log sines, those who possess Thomas's machine will find it

easier to dispense with logarithms and use natural sines and ordinary

arithmetic.

*Clouth. Natural sines and cosines (to G places) and their first nine

multiples (to 4 places) for every centesimcil minute of the quadrant, arranged

seraiquadrantaUy, the sines and their multiples occupying the left-hand pages,

and the cosines the right ; the arguments axe also expressed in sexagesimal

Weminutes and seconds, the intervals being then 32"-4.      have not seen the

work itself, but only a prospectus, containing 2 pp. (108 and 109) as specimens.

Judging from this, the book would contain 208 pp. In the copy of the pro-
spectus before us, the words " Mayen (chcz I'auteur) " are covered by a piece

of paper on which is printed "Halle, Louis Nebert, Libraire-Editeur."

There is no date; but we should judge the table to have been only recently

published.

described in English text-books under the title " Circular Measure ; " so that

in the descriptions in § 4 we have spoken indifferently of the length of the

arc of 0;°, the longitude of >t°, or the circular measure of .r°. The tables of

circular arcs usually give the circular measure of 1°, 2°,. . up to 90°, 180°,

=four hours of time ;                                          1" corresponds to 15°,  1'" to 15', and 1" to ] 5"

 --The facts relating to the invention of Briggian (or decimal) logarithms arc

as follows: In 1614 Napier published his 'Canon ilirificus ' (see § 3,
art. 17), which contained the first announcement of the invention of logarithms,

and also a table of logarithmic sines, calculated so as to be very similar to what
are now called hyperbolic logarithms. HenrtBriggs, then Professor of Geo-

metry at Gresham College, London, and afterwards Savilian Professor of Geo-

metry at Oxford, admired this work so mucli that he resolved to visit Napier.

" Naper, lord of Markinston, hath set my head and hands at work with his

new and admirable logarithms. I hope to see him this summer, if it please

God                   for I never saw a book       which                     pleased me better,  and  made  me  more

wonder," This he says in a letter to Usher (Usher's ' Letters,' p. 3G, accord-

ing to Ward). Briggs accordingly visited Napier, and stayed with him a

whole month (in 1615), He brought with him some calculations he had

made, and suggested to Napier the advantages that would result from the choice

of 10 as a base, having publicly explained them previously in his lectures

at Gresham College, and written to Napier on tlie subject. Napier said that

he had already thought of the change, and pointed out a slight improvement,

viz. that the characteristics of numbers greater than unity should be posi-
tive,^ and not negative, as Briggs suggested. Briggs visited Napier again in
1016, and shoAved him the work he had accompHshcd, and, as he himself says,
would have gladly paid a third visit in 1617, had Napier's life been spared
(he died April 4, 1617). The work alluded to is Briggs's ' Logarithmorum

Chilias Prima,' which was published (privately, we believe) in 1617, after
Napier's death, as in the short preface he states that why his logarithms are dif-

ferent from those introduced by Napier " spcrandum, ejus librum posthumum,
abunde nobis propediem satisfacturum." The liber postlmmus was Napier's
' Constructio,' which appeared in 1619, edited by his son (see § 3, art. 17).
Briggs continued to labour assiduously, and in 1624 published his 'Arith-

nietica Logarithmica,' giving the logarithms of the numbers from 1 to
20,000, and from 90,000 to 100,000 (and in some copies to 101,000), to 14

places.

To the above facts we must add that Napier made a remark, both in Wriglit's

translation of the ' Uescriptio ' (1010) and in the ' llabdologia' (1617), to (lie

effect that lie intended in a second edition to make an alteration equivalent

to taking the logarithm of 10 equal to unity.

We have thought it proper to give the circumstances attending the inveu-

tiou of Briggian logarithms in the ahove detail, as there seems every proba-

bility that the relations of Napier and Briggs may become a subject of con-
troversy among those who have never taken the trouble to examine the

original sources of information, Hutton, in his ' History of Logarithms
(prefixed to all the early editions of his logarithmic tables, and also printed

in vol. i. pp. 306-340 of his ' Tracts,' 1812), has unfortunately interpreted all
Briggs's statements with regard to the invention of decimal logarithms in a
manner clearly contrary to their true meaning, and unfair to Napier. In

reference to the remark in Briggs's preface to the ' Chilias,' that it is to he

--Jiojjed that the posthumous work will explain why the logarithms are different

from Napier's, Hutton proceeds : " And as Napier, after communication had

with Briggs on the subject of altering the scale of logarithms, had given notice,

both in Wright's translation and in his own ' Rabdologia,' printed in 161 7,

of his intention to alter the scale (though it appears very plainly that he never
intended to compute any more), without making any mention of the share
Avhich Briggs had in the alteration, this gentleman modestly gave the above
hint. But not finding any regard paid to it in the said posthumous work,

published by Lord Napier's son in 1619, where the alteration is again adverted

to, but still without any mention of Briggs, this gentleman thought he could

not do less than state the grounds of that alteration himself.
   " Thus, upon the whole matter, it seems evident that Briggs, whether he had

thought of this improvement in the construction of logarithms, of making 1

the logarithm of the ratio 10 to 1 before Lord Napier or not (which is a secret

that could be known only to Napier himself), was the first person who com-

municated the idea of such an improvement to tlie world ; and that he did

this in his lectures to his auditors at Gresham College in the j'ear 1615, very

soon after his perusal of Napier's < Canon Mirificus Logarithmorum ' in the year

1614. He also mentioned it to Napier, both by letter in the same year and on his

first visit to him in Scotland in the summer of the year 1616, when Napier ap-

proved the idea, and said it had already occurred to himself, and that he had

determined to adopt it. It would therefore have been more candid in Lord

Napier to have told the world, in the second edition of this book, that Mr.

Briggs had mentioned this improvement to him, and that he had thereby been

confirmed in the resolution he had already talcen, before Mr. Briggs's com-

munication with him, to adopt it in that his second edition, as being better

fitted to the decimal notation of arithmetic which was in general use. Such

a declaration would have been but an act of justice to Mr. Briggs ; and the
not having made it cannot but incline its to suspect that Lord Napier was

desirous that the world should ascribe to him alone the merit of this very

useful improvement of the logarithms, as well as that of having originally in-

vented them ; though, if the having first communicated an invention to the

world be sufficient to entitle a man to the honour of having first invented it,

Mr. Briggs had the better title to be called the first inventor of this happy

improvement of logarithms."

The above comments of Hutton's are all the more unfortunate because they

occur in a history that is generally accurate and truthful. It is needless

to say that, the facts being as above narrated, there is not the smallest

ground for imputing iinfairness to Napier ; but Hutton seems to have some-

how become possessed of such an idea and read all the facts by the light of it.
On the other hand, however, some of the accounts are scarcely fair to Briggs.
Mr, Mark Napier, in his ' Memoirs of John Napier,' has successfully refuted

Hutton                              but he has fallen into the opposite extreme of extravagantly eulogizing
                                 ;

Napier at the expense of Briggs, whom he reduces to the level of a mere
ON MATHEMATICAL TABLES.                                                51

computer ; and in these terms Mr. Sang has also recently spoken of the latter.
Mr. Napier attributes Huttou's assertions to national jealousy (!) ; and it will
be a matter of regret if any other writers should follow his example in at-

tempting to glorify Napier by depreciating Briggs. The words of the latter,

--in the 1031 translation (and amplification, see below) of his ' Arithmetica ' of

1G24, are : " These numbers were first invented by the most excellent John

Neper, Baron of Marchiston ; and the same were transformed, and the founda-
tion and use of them illustrated with his approbation [ex ejusdem sententia]

by Henry Briggs." No doubt the invention of decimal logarithms occurred

to both Napier and Briggs independently ; but the latter not only first an-

nounced the advantage of the change, but actually completed tables of the

new logarithms. Thus, as regards the idea of the change, Napier and

Briggs divide the honour equally ; while, on the principle that " great points

belong to those who make great points of them," nearly all belongs to Briggs.

On the subject of Briggs and the invention of logarithms, see the careful

and impartial life of Briggs in Ward's ' Lives of the Professors of Gresham

College,' London, 1740, pp. 120-129, and also ' Vitfe quorundam eruditis-
simorum et illustrium virorum' &c., scriptore Thoma Smitho, Londini, 1707
(Vita Henrici Briggii), as well as ' Memoirs of John Napier of Merchiston,' by

Mr. Mark Napier, Edinburgh, 1839, and the same author's ' Naperi libri qui

supersunt' (see § 3, art. 17). See also Hutton's account (reference given above)

and Phil. Mag., October and December (Supplementary No.) 1872, and May

1873. It is proper to add that the date we have given for Briggs's first visit

to Napier, viz. 161.5, is diflferent from that assumed by other writers, viz. 1616;

\ve have, however, little doubt that the former is correct, as it in all respects

{fgrees with the facts. The reason that Ward, Hutton, &c. assign Briggs's

first visit to 1616, and the publication of the ' Chilias' to 1618, is, no doubt,

due to the fact that they supposed Napier to have died in 1618 ; but Mr. Mark

Napier has shown that the true date is 1617 ; and this brings all the facts into

agreement (see Phil. Mag. December 1872, Supp.).

Like Napier, Briggs was not very particular about the spelling of his name.

In Wright's translation it appears as Brigs on the titlepage, Brigges on the

first page of the preface, and Briggs in the eulogistic verses.

   Although we have spoken of logarithms to the base 10 &c., we needscarcely

observe that, although exponents and even fractional exponents were in a sort

of way introduced by Stevinus, neither Napier nor Briggs, nor any one tiU

long after, had any idea of connecting logarithms with exponents.

To return to the original calculation of the logarithms of numbers. Briggs,

ns has been stated, published the logarithms of the numbers from 1 to

20,000 and from 90,000 to 100,000 to fourteen places, in his ' Arithmetica.'
There was thus left a gap from 20,000 to 90,000, which was filled up by

Adrian Vlacq (although Briggs had in the mean time nearly completed the

necessary calculations ; see Phil. Mag. May 1873), who published at Gouda,

in li)28, a table containing the logarithms of the numbers from unity to
100,000 to 10 places of decimals. Having calculated 70,000 logarithms and

copied only 30,000, Vlacq would have been quite entitled to have called his

a new work. He designates it, however, only a second edition of Briggs,

the title running, "Arithmetica logarithmica sive logarithmorum chiliadca

centum, pro numeris naturali serie crescentibus ab TJnitate ad 100000

Editio socuuda aucta per Adrianum Vlacq, Goudanum  Gouda), excudebat

Petrus Eammasenius. 1628." This table of Vlacq's was published, with an
English explanation prefixed, in London in 1631, under the title, " Logarith-

micall Arithmctike, or Tables of Logaritbmes for absolute numbers, from au

                                                   £2

unite to 100000   London, printed by George Miller, 1G31" (full titles arc

given in § 5).

   Speaking of Briggs's ' Arithmetiea Logarithmiea' of 1G24, De Morgan, in

--his article on Tables in the ' English Cyclopedia,' says : " After his [Briggs's]

death, in 1(331, a reprint was, it is said, made by one George Miller ; the

--Latin title and explanatory parts were replaced by English ones ·' Logarith-

micall Arithmctike ' &c. We much doubt the reprint of the tables, and think

that they were Briggs's own tables, with an English explanation prefixed in

place of the Latin one. Wilson (in his ' History of Navigation,' prefixed to

the third edition of llobertson) says that some copies of Vlacq, of 1628, were

purchased by our booksellers, and published at London with an English ex-

planation lu'cmised, dated 1031 . Mr. Babbage (to whose large and rare col-

lection of tables we were much indebted in the original article) has one of

these copies ; and the English explanation and title is the same as that which

Wewas in the same 3'ear attached to the asserted reprint of Briggs.  have no

doubt that Briggs and Vlacq were served exactly in tlie same manner." On

referring to Robertson (fourth edition, p. xvi), there is found to be no further

information than that contained in the above extract. That De Morgan's

suggestion is quite correct, and that Miller's and Vlacq 's tables are both

printed from the same types, we have assured ourselves by a most careful

comparison, which leaves no doubt whatever that the two works are printed

Wefrom the same type throughout.  are thus enabled to state that the

same errata-list suffices for both ; and this is important, as Vlacq (1G28,
or 1031) is still the most convenient and most used ten-figure table in ex-
istence. Briggs's friends were annoyed at Vlacq's publication ; but it must
be borne in mind that their objections have reference, not so much to the table

(which is the only thing of practical importance now) as to the prefixed tri-

gonometry, which Vlacq curtailed in his '·' second edition." George Miller also

published some copies of the original 'Arithmetica' of 1624, with the same title-

page and introduction as were prefixed to the copies of Vlacq of 1628 ; and this
was distinctly wrong, as the titlepage does not in this case describe the con-

tents correctly.

   It thus appears that Briggs's table was published in 1624, and Vlacu's in

--1628 that copies of the tabular portions of both these works were obtained by

George Miller, and published by him in 1631, with the same (English) title-

page and introduction, Avhich, though correctly describing the contents of

Vlacq, is quite inaj^propriate for Briggs. This has led to a verj^ great amoinit

of confusion, which has been greatly increased by the fact that on the title-

pages Briggs's and Neper's names occur, and that Vlacq only called his work
a second edition. It is in consequence exceedingly common to see Vlacq's
work assigned to Briggs or Neper ; and it is almost invariably ascribed to one

or other of the latter in the catalogues of libraries.

Vlacq's 'Aritlimetica' of 1628 was also published with the same date, with

a French title (" Arithmetique Logarithmctique " &c.) and introduction.

--Vlacq modestly describes his share of the calculation in the words : " La

description est traduit du Latin en Francois, la premiere Table augmentee,

et la secoude composee par Adriaen Vlacq." Miller's (1631) copies of Vlacq

Weare not so rare as the extract from De Morgan might imply.  have seen

five of them, and only three or four of the original (1628) works (including

both Latin and French).

   In 1031 Vlacq published his ' Trigonometria Artificialis' (§4). This
work contains, among other tables, the logarithms of the numbers from unity

to 20,000, printed also (with the exception of the last sheet, referred to fur-
ther on) from the same type.

No further calculation of logarithms of numhers took pluco till the end of

--the last century, when the great French manuscript tables (the ' Tables

Du Cadastre' see description of them below) were comiKited under the

direction of Prony. These, as is well known, hare never been published.

In 1794 Vega published his ' Thesaurus Logarithmorum Completus/ which

contains a complete ten-figure table from 1000 to 101,000. It was not, how-

ever, the result of a fresh calculation, but was cojued from Ylacq, after ex-

amination and correction of many errors (see Vega's ' Thesaurus,' § 4).

   In 1871 Mr. Sang published his seven-figure table of logarithms of numbers

to 200,000, the second half of which was obtained by a new calculation. It is

thus seen that, with the exception of the Tables du Cadastre, and the second

half of Mr. Sang's table, every one of the hundreds of the tables that have

appeared                           has been  copied from Eriggs or Vlacq                                                                                                                            and considering the enor-
                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

mous number of calculations in which logarithms have been employed,

and the vast saving they have eftected of labour, it must be admitted that

(apart from the fact that the great tables of Ertggs and Ylacq remain

still unsuperseded) great historical interest attaches to the original com-

putation.

Ylacq's ten-figure table contains about 300 errors (leaving out of consi-

deration errors atfecting only the last figure by a unit). The greater number

of these were found cither by Vega, or by Lefort from comparison with the
Tables dtt Cadastre : complete references and a small subsidiary list are

given in the ' Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society ' for May

and June 1872. While speaking of ten-figure logarithms, we may men-

tion PiNETo's table described below ; but Vlacq (1628 or 1631) and Vega

(1794) are far preferable : they are unfortunately so rare, however, that not

many besides those Avho have access to a good library can make use of

them, and, except to a few, the employment of ten-figure logarithms in their

most convenient form is denied : we much prefer Vlacq to Vega for use, as

the arrangement is more convenient.

To return to the history of logarithmic tables to a less number of figures.

In 1625 Wingatc published at Paris his ' Arithmetique Logarithmetique,' con-

taining seven-figure logarithms to 1000, and logarithmic sines and tangents

from GuNTER (see De Morgan ; the full title of the Gouda edition of Wingate

(1628) is given by Hogg, p. 408), thus introducing Briggian logarithms into

France                             and in 1626  appeared both Henrion's 'Traicte' (§ 4) at                                                                                                          Paris, con-
                                ;

taining 20,000 logarithms from Briggs and Gunters logarithmic sines and

tangents, and De Decker's ' Nieuwe Telkonst ' (§ 4) at Gouda, giving also

logarithms from Briggs and Gunter; then Vlacq began to calculate logarithms,

and brought them in 1628 to the state in which they now are. There is a table'

of logarithms in Norwood's 'Trigonometric' (1031) ; and in 1633 appeared

Eoe's table (§ 4), in which the first four figures of the logarithm are printed

at the top of the column. This was an advance halfway to the modern arrange-

ment, which was introduced in its present form in John Newton's eight-figure

table (1658). On Fatohaber, 1631, and Oughtred, 1657, see § 4.

Tables of seven- and five-figure logarithms are too numerovis to notice

here separately. The cliief line of descent is Briggs, Vlacq, IIoe, perhaps

Newton, the editions of Sherwin, Gardiner; and then both Hutton and

ACallet bring down the succession to the present day.                                                                                                                                               very fair account

of several logarithmic tables is given by Hogg in section iv. " Elementar-

Gcometrie " (B) of his ' Ilandbuch,' who added to the books described in this

part of his bibliography a description of the contents. But the reader must

be warned against trusting his accounts, except where he is clearly describing

works he has seen. Of seven-figure tables we have found Babbage as con-

venient as any, and it is nearly free from error ; Callet and Htjtton are also

much used ; Shortrede and Sang are both conspicuous for giving the multii^les

of the differences instead of proportional parts ; the latter work also extends

to 200,000 instead of 100,000 as usual. Of five-figure tables De Morgan's

(Useful-Knowledge Society) tables are considered the best, and arc practically

Wefree from error.                    cannot, however, here particularize the advantages of

the different tables, which must be gathered from their full descriptions.

Some of them have, of course, been merely included on account of their his-

Wetorical value.        may here mention that the subject of errors in these tables

will be considered in a subsequent Report.

   Vega (p. iii of the Introduction to the ' Thesaurus,' 1794) says that Ylacq's
' Arithmetica ' (1628) and ' Trigonometria ' (1633) were printed at Pekin in
1721, under the title " Magnus Canon Logarithmorum, tum pro sinibus ac

tangeutibus ad singula dena secunda, tum pro numeris absolutis ab unitate ad

100,000. Typis sinensibus in Aula Pckinonsi, jussu Impcratoris cxcusus,
1721 " (three volumes folio, on Chinese paper), and that a copy had been

offered him for sale two years previously (1792). Montucla (' Histoire,'

vol. iii. p. 358) says, the name of the Emperor in question was Kang-hi.
   Rogg also (p. 408) confirms Yega, extracting the title from Brunet's

* Manuel du Libraire.'

   In the preface to his tables (1849) Mr. Filipowski concludes by a sneering
remark on the Chinese, saying that Mr. Babbage proved, " as had long been

suspected, from what source those original inventors had derived their

logai'ithms ; " and we have noticed this tendency to ridicule the Chinese in

this matter as detected plagiarists in others. In point of fact there is no more

plagiarism than when Babbage or Callet publishes a table of logaritlims with-
out the name of Ylacq on the titlepage. The first publication in China, we

infer from Rogg, merely professed to be a reprint of Vlacq ; and if logarithms

came into general use, it is natural that they would be published, as with us,
without the original calculator's name. The fault is with those who form

preconceived opinions on subjects they have not investigated.

A ATurkish table of logarithms is described in § 4.                                          small table of

logarithms to base 2 is noticed below, imder Montferrier, 1840.

  We may mention a little book, ' Instruction clcmentaire et pratique sur

I'usage des Tables de Logarithmes,' by Prony (Paris, 1834, 12mo), which

explains the manner of using of tables of logarithms &c., adapted to Callet,

   In many seven-figure tables of logarithms of numbers the values of S and T

are given at the top of each page, with Y, the variation of each, for the purpose

--of deducing log sines and tangents. S and T are the values of log --, and

--loo- - L for the number of seconds denoted by certain numbers (sometimes
  °X

only the first, sometimes every tenth) in the number-column on each page.
Thus, in Callet, 1853, on the page of Avhich the first number is 67200,

      sin 6720"                       ^T=l,og  tan 6720"              ...            ,, ,,,                 ...  .

have 8=4-6854980, and log 6732-7 = 3-8281893, whence, by addition, we

have  8-5136873;        but Y for^lO" is           -2-29                             whence  the variation  for 12"-7

the ' Yerslagcii en Mededeelingen der Kouinklijke Akademie van Weten-

rithmic tables of all kinds, with the dates and places of publication (from 1014
to 1862), that we have seen, and must be nearly perfect. Some remarks arc
made on those of them that de Haan has examined himself ; and there is ap-
pended a valuable index of reference to papers on logarithms that have ap-

peared in any Journal or Society's Proceedings.

   We may also refer to the paper of Gernerth's noticed under Rheticus,

1596 (§ 3, art. 10), Avhich contains a number of last-figure errors in logarith-
mic ancl other tables. Gernerth was desirous of ascertaining the care bestowed
on the editing of mathematical tables, and considering that it was best
measured by the accuracy of the last figure, he confined himself to the exa-
mination of this point alone (except in the cases of Rheticus and Pitiscus,
where tlie first seven or eight figures were included) , and detected very many

errors. He altogetlicr examined tables by eighteen authors ; but generally,

where the errors were numerous, he has given only five per cent, of those that

he found.

   Also, as this sheet is passing through the press, we add references to two

papers in the ' Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society ' for

April and May, 1873, " On the Progress to accuracy of Logarithmic Tables,"
and " On Logarithmic Tables ;" in the former of which the number of Vlacq's

original errors that were reproduced in succeeding works is discussed, while
the latter contains remarks on logarithmic tables both of numbers and trigo-

nometrical fanctions. An abstract of the first appears also in the ' Journal

of the Institute of Actuaries,' vol. xvii. pp. 352-354.

Briggs, 1617. Logarithms of numbers from unity to 1000 to 14 places

of decimals. This was the first table of Rriggian logarithms calculated or

published. Neither author's name nor date nor place appears on the title-

page of the work, which is a mere tract of 16 pp. (at all events in the Brit.

Mus. copy) ; but that it was published by Briggs in 1617 is beyond doubt

(see ' Phil. Mag.' he. cit. below).

The preface concludes with the motto "In tenui; sed non tenuis fructusve

laborve." On the work see the introductory remarks to tliis Article, aud

also 'Phil. Mag.' December (Supplementary No.) 1872. It is stated by

Hutton and all the other writers to be an 8-place table ; but it really is as

described above. One reason for the universal error is that copies are so

extremely rare that we have only been able to see one *, viz. that in the British

Museum, in the catalogue of which it is entered under Logarithms, and

marked as of [1695 ?]. The book is not in the printed Bodleian Catalogue. It

is peculiarly interesting as being the first publication of decimal logarithms.

Nearly all the descriptions and bibliographies will be found very erroneous,

several confounding it  with "Wright's  translation of Napier's  '  Canon                           (see
                                                                                                 '

neously described as being to 15 places. The table occupies 300 pages.

 --Several lists of errata in this work have been given viz. by Vlacq

in his ' Arithinctica,' by Shekwin in his tables, by Vuga (folio, 1794), by
Ly.FOET (' Annalcs de rObscrvatoire dc Paris'). The introduction occujncs
88 pages, and is in Latin.

    In some copies there is an additional chiliad added, so that the range of
the second portion of the table is from 90,000 to 101,000 ; and there is a
table of square roots of numbers up to 200, to 10 places, occupying the last
two pages : these copies are very rare. There is one in the Library of
Trinity College, Cambridge, with the following note in it by Dr. Brinkley :

    " This is a very scarce copy, having an addition very rarely to be met
with. Vide Ilutton's preface to his ' Logarithms,' p. 33, Avho could never
find a copy with the addition." Mr. Merrifield has also one of the.se

 copies.

    On this v.'ork sec the introductory remarks to this Article.
   Tables du Cadastre. On the proposition of Carnot, Prieur, and Brunct,
the French Government decided in 1784 that new tables of sines, tangents,

 &c., and their logarithms, should be calculated in relation to the centesimal
 division of the quadrant. Prony was charged with the direction of the work,
and was expressly required " non sculement a composer des Tables qui ne lais-

 sasscnt ricn a dcsirer quant a I'exactitudc, maisa en faire le monument de calcul

--le plus vaste et le plus imposant qui eiit jamais etc execute ou meme congu,"

 an order faithfully carried out. Prony divided the calculators &c. into three
 sections : the first consisted of five or six mathematicians (including Lcgendre),

 who were engaged in the purely analytical work, or the calculation of the

 fundamental numbers ; the second section consisted of seven or eight calcu-
 lators possessing some mathematical knowledge ; and the third comprised
 the ordinary computers, 70 or 80 in number. The woi'k, which was done
 wholly in duplicate, and independently by the two divisions of computers,

 occupied two years.
     As a consequence of the double calculation, there arc two manuscripts in

 existence, one of which has been long deposited in the Archives of the Obser-
 A'atory ; the other, though supposed to be in the Archives of the Bureau des

 Longitudes, was in reality in the possession of Prony's heirs, by whom it was

 presented to the Library of the Institute in 1858.

     Each of the two manuscripts consists essentially of 17 large folio volumes,

 the contents being as follows :

Logarithms of numbers to 200,000     8 vols.

Natural sines                        1 vol.

Logarithms of the ratios of arcs to sines from O^-OOOOO to 1 ,                                                                                                                                                 .,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               '

Logarithms of the ratios of arcs to tangents from 0«-00000 1

      to O''0-5000, and log tangents throughout the 14

quadrant                          J

It would take too much space to state the intervals &c. in detail. Speaking

generally, the trigonometrical functions are given for every hundred-thousandth
of the quadrant (10" centesimal or 3"-24 sexagesimal). The tables were all

calculated to 14 places, with the intention of publishing only 12 ; but M. Le-
fort, who has recently examined them, states that the twelfth figure may be in
error by as much as 0-8 of a unit in this place, though a little additional care
would have rendered it more accurate. The Institute copy has also a table of the
first 500 multiples of certain sines and cosines ; and the Observatory copies
have an introduction containing, among several other subsidiary tables, the first
         OS MAXilEMATiCAL TAULES.                                    ',

20 powers of r^ to 28 figures. It may be mentioned that the logarithms of

10,000 primes were calcuhitod to 19 places, and tlie natural sines for every

minute (centesimal) to 22 places. This account of the ' Tables du Cadastre

has been abridged from a memoir by M. Lefort, in t. iv. (pp. [123]-[150]) of
tlie ' Annales de I'Observatoire do Paris ' (1858), where an explanation of the

methods of calculation, with the formulas &c., is given. The printing of the

table of natural sines was once begun. M. Lefort says that he has seen six

copies, all incomplete, although including the last page. De Morgan also men-

tions that he had seen some of the proofs. Babbage compared his table with

the ' Tables du Cadastre ;' and M. Lefort has given, by means of them, most

important lists of errors in Vlacq and Beiggs ; but these are almost the only
uses that have been made of tables the calculation of which required so great
an expenditure of time and money. " In 1820," says De Morgan, " a dis-

tinguished member of the Board of Longitude, London, was instructed by our

Uovernment to propose to the Board of Longitude of Paris to print an abridg-

ment of these tables, at the joint expense of the two countries. £5000 was

named as the sum which our Government was willing to advance for this
purpose ; but the proposal was declined " (Peuny Cyclopaedia, Article
" Prony "). The value of the logarithms of numbers is now materially

lessened by Mr. Sang's seven-figure table from 20,000 to 200,000 (see

Saxg, 1871, in this Article).

(pp. 23-^8). The author was an accountant; and the table was intended

for commercial purposes, its use in which is explained in the book,

   Reishammer, 1800. These are commercial logarithms, intended for
merchants &c. When the number is less than unity, the logarithm of its

reciprocal (which the author calls the Jor/aritJime nef/afif)is tabulated; if

greater than unit}', its own logarithm (lor/ariihme 2^ositif). The first table

(which only occupies 2 pages) gives the locjarWimes neijatifs of the frac-

tions from ^i-y to 1, at intervals of -j-J^y ^o ^ places (the characteristics are

given, and not separated from the other figures). This is followed by the

principal table, which occupies 117 pages. On the first page are given the

lo(jarilhmcs nc</atlfs of 128 fractions, viz. of all proper fractions whose deno-

--minators arc 60, 48, 40, or 32, arranged in order thus : ^'^, -L, J^, ^L, J-y

· · · -as' ou' §&· '^^^ r^st of ^^c logarithms are j^ositifs ; and the argu-
ments proceed from 1 to 111, with the 128 fractions just described inter-

mediate to each integer. Thus we have l^^j, l-J^, &c., 2-j,\, 2-Jyr, &c., as
arguments. The arguments then proceed from 111 to 207 at intervals of

^,·.,15^, from 207 to 327 at intervals of  thence to 807 at intervals of §, and
--from 808 to 10,400 at intervals of unity, all to 5 places. The characteristics

Aare given throughout.  page of proportional parts is added.

There arc besides several small tables, to facilitate the calculations, only

one of which requires notice. It gives on a folding sheet the 128 fractions

previously described, expressed as fractious with denominators 100 and 10,
and also (when the numerator is integral) expressed as fractions with de-

nominators GO, 48, 40, 32, 30, 24, 20, IG, 15, 12, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. Thus -^

(or higher terms with any of the above denominators); it only appears as 5 ia

 the 48 column.
    In reference to a work by Girtanuer (179-i) which we have not seen, but

which appears to be very similar to the present, De Morgan justl}'^ remarks,
" But it will not do : Mohammed must go to the mountain. When coin-

age, weights, and measures are decimalized, the use of logarithms will foUow
 as a matter of course. It is useless trying to bring logarithms to ordinary

 fractions."

Of the 20 pages 4 are occupied with explanations &c. The arrangement is as

in seven-figure tables.

    Steinberger, 1840. The titlepage is misleading ; the logarithms do not
extend from 1 to 1,000,000, but only from 1 to 10,000. The only pretext
for giving 1,000,000 as the limit is that, of course, two additional figures may
be obtained by interpolation ; but on this principle ordinary seven-figure

tables should be described as extending, not to 100,000, but to 10,000,000.

    The first five figures of the logarithms are printed in larger type than, and

separated by an interval from, the last two, so that the table may be more

conveniently used either as a five- or seven-figure table ; the change of
figure is denoted by an asterisk prefixed to all the logarithms affected. The
figures, though large, are not clear, the appearance of the page being dazzling
the 6's and 9's also seem too large for the other figures, and after all are not

very readily distinguishable from the O's. No differences or proportional

parts are given.

   Montferrier's Mathematical Dictionary, 1840. Under the Article

"Logarithmes," in t. iii. (the supplementary volume) is given a table of four--
figure logarithms of numbers from 1000 to 10,000 (pp. 271-279).

   In the same volume (p. 2.52, facing letter L) is given a table of logarithms
of the numbers from 1 to 420 to base 2 to five places, the only table of th&
kind wo have met with.

   Babbage, 1841. Seven-figure logarithms of numbers from 1 to 1200 and

from 10,000 to 108,000, with diflferences and proportional parts (the last
8000 are given to 8 places). Degrees, minutes, and seconds are also added,
but they arc divided from the numbers by a thick black line, and are printed
in somewhat smaller type, so that they are not so obtrusive as in Callet and

others. On the last page there are a few constants.

    Great pains were taken Avith the preparation of this table (which is stereo-

type), with the view of ensuring the maximum of clearness &c., and -wdth

success. The change of figure in the middle of the block is marked by a
change in type in the fourth figure in all the logarithms affected. This is,
we think, with the exception of the asterisk, the best method that has been
used. The chief defect, or rather point capable of improvement, is that tho
three leading figures in the logarithms are not separated, or in any way dis-
tinguished, from tho rest of the figures in the block, as is the case in Callet
and others. The table was read (wholly or partially) altogether nine times
with different tables of logarithms (four of those readings were made after the
stereotyping), and is no doubt all but perfectly correct.

   One feature of this table is that every last figure that has been increased is
marked with a dot subscript.

  We know of only two errors : viz., in log 52943 the last figure should bo

5 instead of 6 ; and in log 102467 the last two figures should be 02 instead of
92. The occurrence of the former of these errors is very remarkable, as the
logarithm is correct in Vega (folio, 1794), with which the table was read
twice (sec Sang, 'Athenaeum,' June 8, 1872, and Glaisher, 'AthensBum,'
June 15, 1872, or ' Journal of the Institute of Actuaries,' July 1872 and
January 1873). The latter is given in Gould's (American) 'Astronomical

Journal,' vol. iv. p. 48.

 --Copies of the book were printed on papers of different colours yellow,

brown, green, ifec, as it was considered (no doubt justly) that black on a

white ground fatigues the eye more than any other combination *. Yellow

or light brown seem the colours most preferred by computers, green not being

very satisfactory.

 --In the preface to his tables (1849), Mr. Filipowski writes : " Babbage's

' Tables of Logarithms,' which probably are the most accurate of all ; for, by

the aid of his ingenious calculating machine, he was enabled to detect a

variety of errors in former tables." This is untrue.

   Gray, 1865. The table in this tract is rather an auxiliary table to

facilitate the calculation of logarithms to twelve places, than a table itself.

The tables at the end of the work (see p. 2 of the Introduction) give

+ ++log(l -001n), log (l -00rn), log (1 -O0r70> from «==0 to k=999, at

intervals of unity, to twelve places. The use of the sequantities in the cal-

culation of logarithms is well-known (see, e.g.. Introduction to Shokteede's

Tables, vol. i. 1849). Pages 43-55 are occupied with the history of the

metliod, and will be found valuable and interesting. The rest of the book

is devoted to explanations &c.

   Weddle's method of calculating the logarithms of numbers by resolving

--them into the reciprocals of series of factors of the form 1 ·!";·, r being a

digit, and then using a subsidiary table of the logarithms of these factors, is

fidly explained, as also are some improved methods of Mr. Gray's own,

depending substantially on the same principle ; and aU arc illustrated with

full numerical examples. The whole constitutes the most complete account

of the simplest and best of the known methods for the calculation of isolated

logarithms that we have met with ; and any one engaged on work of this

kind would do well to consult it. Of course for calculating a table, the

Pineto, 1871. This work consists of three tables ; the first (Table

auxiliaire) contains a series of factors by which the numbers whose logarithms

are required are to bo multiplied to bring them within the range of
Table 2, and occupies three pages. It also gives the logarithms of the

reciprocals of the factors to twelve places. Table 1 merely gives logarithms

to 1000, to ten places. Table 2 gives logarithms from 1,000,000 to 1,011,000

to ten places ; the left-hand pages contain the logarithms, and the right-

liand Images the proportional parts, which are given for every hundredth

of the differences. The change in the line is denoted by an asterisk ; and

the last figure is underlined -when it has been increased.

 --The mode of using the tables is as follows : If the first figures of the

number lie between 1000 and 1011, the logarithm can be taken out directly

Mfrom table 2 ; if not, a factor is found from the auxiliary table, by which

the number must be multiidicd in order to make its initial figures lie between

these limits, and so bring it within the range of table 2. After performing

this multiplication the logarithm can be taken out ; and to neutralize the

--effect of the multiplication, as far as the result is concerned, log  must

Mbe added ; this quantity is therefore given in an adjoining column to in

Athe auxiliary table.   similar procedure gives the number answering to any

logarithm, only that another factor (approximately the reciprocal of M) is

given, so that in both cases multiplication is used.

  MThe laborious part of the work is the multiplication by the factor
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

but this is compensated to a great extent by the ease with which, by the

proportional parts, the logarithm is taken out. Great pains have been taken

Mto choose the factors  (which are 300 in number) so as to minimize this

labour ; and of the 300 only 25 consist of three figures all diflPcrent and not
involving or 1. Whenever it was possible, factors containing two figures

alike or containing a 0, or of only one or two figures, have been found. The

process of taking out a logarithm is rather longer than if Ylacq or Yega

were used ; but, on the other hand, the size of this book (only about 80 pp.
8vo) is a great advantage, both of the former works being large folios. Also

both Vlacq and Vega are so scarce as to be very difficult to procure ; so that
Pineto's table will be often the only ten-figure table available for any one who

has not access to a good library ; and on this account it is unique. Though

the principle of multiplying by a factor, which is subsequently cancelled by

subtracting its logarithm, is frcquentl}'^ employed in the construction of tables,

this is, we believe, the first instance in which it forms part of the process of
iisvi{j the table. By taking the numbers to 12 instead of 10 places, in a
manner explained in the introduction, greater accuracy in the last place

is ensured than results from the use of Vlacq or Vega. It is not stated

whether the table is stereotyped ; so we pi'esume it is not.
   On the last page (p. 56) are given the first hundred multiples of the

modulus and its reciprocal to 10 places. (Notices and examples taken from

Pineto's tables will be found in the ' Quarterly Journal of Mathematics ' for

October 1871, and the ' Messenger of Mathematics ' for July 1872.)

logaritlims, from 20,000 to 200,000, with differences and multiples (not pro-

portional parts) of the differences throughout.

The advantages arising from the table extending from 20,000 to 200,000,

instead of from 10,000 to 100,000, are, that whereas in the latter the dif-

ferences near the beginning of the table are so numerous that the propor-

tional parts must either be very crowded or some of them omitted, and even

if they are aU given the interpolation is inconvenient, in a table extending

from 20,000 to 200,000 the differences are halved in magnitude, while the
number of them in a page is quartered ; the space gained enables multiples

instead of proportional parts to be given.

   The table is printed without rules (except one dividing the logarithms

reversed commas. The absence of rules does not appear to us by any
means an unqualified advantage ; and a farther drawback is that numbers
and logarithms are printed in the same type. The change of figure in the

line is denoted by an Arabic nokta (a sign like the diamond in a pack of cards)
and this, tliough very clear for O's, leaves the other figures unchanged, and

is greatly inferior in all points of vievr to the simple asterisk prefixed, or the

small figure as used by Babbage.

In spite of these drawbacks the table is very convenient, and has

advantages possessed by no other, as, in addition to the greater ease with

--which the interpolations can be performed, greater accuracy is obtained the

last figure being often inaccurate by one or tv/o units in logarithms inter-

Wel^olated from the usual seven-figure tables.  find, however, that computers

prefer Babbaoe, except for numbers beginning with 1.

The logarithms of the numbers between 100,000 and 200,000 were calcu-

lated de novo by Mr. Sang, as if logarithms had never been computed before
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

and a very full account of the method and manner in whicli the calcula-

tions were performed is given by him in the * Edinbm-gh Transactions,'

vol. xxvi. pt. iii. (1871). Tliis is the only calculation of common logarithms of

numbers since the days of Vlacq, 1628 (except the French manuscript tables).

   Two errors in the book (which is stereotyped) were pointed out in the

* Athenajum' for Juno 8 and 15, 1872, viz. the last figures of log 389G2 and

52943 should be 2 and 5 instead of 3 and 6 respectively.

                         Art. 14. Tables of AntllogaritJims.

In the ordinary tables of logarithms the natural numbers are all integers,

while the logarithms tabulated are only approximate, most of them being

incommensurable. Thus interpolation is in general necessary in order to
find the number answering to a given logarithm, even to five figures. It

was natural therefore to form a table in which the logarithms were exact

quantities, -00001, -00002, -00003                  to -99999, &c., and the numbers in-

commensurable. Few of such tables have been constructed, as for most

purposes the ordinary tables are sufficiently convenient, and computers much

prefer to have only oue work to refer to. The earliest antilogarithmic table

is DoDsoN, 1742 ; and the only others of any extent are Shortrede (1844
and 1849) and Filipowski (1849), described in § 4. Mr, Peter Gray has
a large tAvclve-figurc antilogarithmic table far advanced towards completion

but whether it will be published is uncertain.

corresponding to logarithms from -00000 to 1-00000, at intervals of -00001,

arranged like a seven-figure logarithmic table, -with interscript differences,

and proportional parts at the bottom of the page. The changes in the fourth

figure in the middle of the column, both in the numbers and the differences,

are marked by points and commas, but not very clearly. Tliere is an intro-

duction of 84 pages ; and the tables occupy about 250 pages.

   In page ix of the Introduction an extract is given from Wallis, who states

that Harriot began, and Warner completed, a table of antilogarithms, which

was ready for press fifty years before. This was told Wallis by Dr. Pell, who

had assisted Warner in the calculation ; and Wallis mentions that he had

himself seen the calculation thirty years before, among Harriot's or Warner's

papers. Dr. Pell subsequently informed WaUis that the papers were in the

hands of Dr. Busby, and that he (Dr. Pell) hoped to publish them shortly.

Dr.    Pell  died           in  1685                           and at the                                                                                                                    time Wallis  wrote Dr.  Busby was

--also dead, and the printing had not been begun. Speaking of this manu-

script De Morgan remarks : " All our efforts to trace it, by help of published

letters <fcc., lead to the conclusion that, if existing, it must be among Lord

Macclesfield's unexamined manuscripts at Sbireburn Castle : this is by no

means improbable." See, however, some additional information and im-

portant remarks by De Morgan, ' Budget of Paradoxes ' (1872), pp. 457, 458.

  A list of thirty-six errors affecting the first eight figures in Dodson's

canon is given by Filipoavski in the preface to his 'Antilogarithms' (1849).

Mr. Peter Gray (' Insurance Record,' June 9, 1871) says that in 1847 he had

collected a list of 125 errors in Dodsou ; these he communicated to Shorteede,
and they were corrected in the plates of his tables (1849). Dodson's work

is unique of its kind, and it remained the only antilogarithmic canon for

more than a century after its completion, till in 1844 Shorteede published

the first edition of his tables ; in 1849 he published his second edition ; and

in the same year Filipowski's tables appeared.

     Art. 15. Talks of (Briggian) Loganthmic Trigonometrical Functions,

   A general account of the introduction of Briggian logarithms is given in

§  3,  art.  13             and Napier's                       ' Canon Mirificus' (1614), containing a Napierian
                         ;

logarithmic canon, is described in § 3, art. 17. The first table of decimal

logarithms of numbers was published by Brtggs in 1617, and the first

(decimal) logarithmic canon by Gunter in 1620 (see below), giving the

results to 7 places. The next calculation was by Vlacq, who appended to

his ' Centum Chiliades ' in the ' Arithmetica ' of 1628 a minute logarithmic

canon to 10 places, obtained by calculating the logarithms of the sines &c.

of Ehetictjs. After the publication of his ' Ai-ithmetica ' in 1624, Beiggs

devoted himself to the calculation of logarithmic sines &c., and at his death

in 1631 had all but completed a ten-decimal canon to every hundredth of a
                                                                                                       ;

flegree. This was published by Tlacq at liis own expense at Gouda in

1633, under the title ·' Trigonometria Britannica ' (see below) : the intro-

duction was written by Gellibraud, by whose name the book is sometimes

cited. In the same year Vlacq published his ' Trigonometria Artiiicialis,'

containing a ten-aecond canon to ten decimals. Guntee's original table

contains a good many errors in the last figures ; and a very slight comparison

shows whether any particular table was copied from Gunter or Vlacq
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

IIenrion, 1626, and de Decker, 162G (§ 4), are from the former, Faulhaber

(§ 4), 1631, from the latter. Briggs appreciated clearly the advantages of

a centesimal division of the quadrant, and, by taking a hundredth of a degree

instead of a minute, made a step towards a reformation in this respect

and Hutton has truly remarked that, but for the appearance of Vlacq's

work, the decimal division of the degree might have become recognized,

as is the case with the corresponding division of the second*.

The next great advance on the ' Artificialis' was more than a century and

a half afterwards, when Michael Taylor (1792) published his seven-decimal

canon to every second (§ 4). On account of its great size, and for other reasons,

it never                        came  into very general  use, Bagay's  1829  (§  4)  being  preferred
                                                                                                                                 ;

the latter is now, however, very difficult to procure. The only other canon

to eveiy second we have seen or heard of is Shorirede's, 1844 and 1849

(§ 4), which is the most complete as regards proportional parts &c. that we
know of. The canon is in modern editions issued separately.

Lalande (' Encyclopedic Methodiquc. ifatheraatiques,' Ast. Tables) states

that in April 1784 he received from M. Robert, cure of St. Genevieve at

Toul, a volume of sines for every second of the quadrant, and soon after

the tangents ; but he had heard that Taylor, in England, was engaged in

publishing log sines and cosines to every second, and that the Board of

Longitude had contributed £300 to the expense. These volumes were pur-

chased by Babbage at the sale of Delambre's library, and they appear in the

Babbage Catalogue (only the title of the table of sines is given ; but it is to

be presumed that the library contains both, as two volumes arc spoken of).

Babbage lent them in 1828 to the Board of Longitude ; and some errata in

Taylor, 1792, were found by means of them. [They are now (1873) in the

possession of Lord Lindsay, who has purchased the whole of Mr. Babbage 's

mathematical library.]

No ten-decimal canon to every second has been calculated. The French

manuscript tables are described in § 3, art. 13. Of logarithmic trigonometrical

canons that have appeared the number is very great. We may especially

mention Callet, 1853; Bremiker's Vega, 1857; Hutton, 1858; Schron,
1860; Dupuis, 1868; and Bruhns, 1870.

_ * The centesimal division of the degree is of paramount imporiance, wliereas the cente-

simal division of the right angle is of next to none at all ; and had the French mathemati-

cians at the end of the last century been content with the former, it is not unlikely that their

tables woidd have superseded the sexagesimal ones still in use, instead of liaving been almost

totally ignored by computers. Thehundredlh part of a right angle is almost as arbitrary a

unit as the ninetieth ; and no advantage (but on the contrary great inconvenience) would re-

sult from the change ; but to divide the nonagcsimaldegree into centesimal minutes, and these

into centesimal seconds, &c., in other words to measure angles by degrees and decimals of

a degree, wo\ikl ensure all the advantages of a decimal system (a saving of work in interpo-

lations, multiphcations, &e.). This Briggs and his followers. Roe, Oughtred, John Newton,

&c., perceived and acted upon two hundred and fifty years ago ; and they seem to liave
shown a truer appreciation of the matter than did the French mathematicians. It may
be taken for granted that the magnitude of the degree will never be altered; but there is
no reason why sexagesimal minutes and seconds should not be replaced by decimals of a

degree                          and this is a change which might, and we hope will hereafter be made.

Gunter, 1620. Log sines and tangents for every minute of the quadrant

(semiquadrantally arranged) to 7 places. This is the first (Briggian) loga-

rithmic trigonometrical canon calculated or published. The book is ex-
tremely scarce ; and we have only seen one copy of it, viz. that in the British
Museum, where it is bound up with Briggs's ' Logarithmorum Chilias Prima.'

There is engraved on the titlepage a diagram of a spherical triangle, S P Z.
De Morgan (who had never seen a copy) says that it also contains logarithms

of numbers as far as 1000 ; but this is not correct. The British-Museum copy
has written in ink on the titlepage, " Eadius autem verus est 10,000,000,000."

This has reference to the fact that the logarithm of the radius is taken

to bo 10, and is true in one sense, but not in the usual one, which

is that, this being the radius, the sines &c. are true to the nearest unit.

Custom has veiy properly decided to consider the radius of a logarithmic

canon the same as what would be the radius of the resulting natural canon

Weif the logarithms were replaced by their numbers.  have not seen the

second edition, in which no doubt the logarithms of numbers mentioned

by De Morgan were added ; or it is just possible that some copies of

Briggs's ' Chilias ' (1617) were issued with the ' Canon,' both being bound

together in the copy we have seen, and that this has given rise to the

Aassertion. Gunter's ' Canon ' was also issued under an English title, '

Canon of Triangles,' &c. (Bodleian Catalogue) : see Phil. Mag. (Suppl. No.)

places) and tangents and secants (to 10 places), also log sines (to 14

places) and tangents (to 10 places), at intervals of a hundredth of a degree
from 0° to 45°, with interscript differences for aU the functions. The

division of the degree is thus centesimal; but the corresponding argu-

ments in minutes and seconds are also given, the intervals so expressed

being 36".

   This table was calculated by Briggs ; but he did not live to publish it. The

trigonometry is by Gellibrand.

   Gunter, 1673. At the end of the work is given a table of log sines and
tangents for every minute of the quadrant to 7 places, followed by seven-

figure logarithms of numbers to 10,000.
   The table of log sines &c. is printed as it appeared in Gxjnter's ' Canon

Triangulorum,' 1620, as the last figures in very many instances differ from

the correct values, which were first given by Vlacq in the ' Arithmetica ' &c.

(1628).

   This is the fifth edition of Gunter's works; but we remember to have seen

it stated somewhere that the works themselves (separate) were regarded

as the first edition in this enumeration.

   Berthoud, 1775. At the end of the ' Recueil des Tables n^cessaires

pour trouver la longitude en mer,' is a table of log sines to every minute of

the quadrant to 6 places (pp. 25-34).
   Callet, 1827 (* Log Sines &c.'). Log sines and tangents for every second

to 5°, and log sines, cosines, tangents, and cotangents from 0° to 45°, at

intervals of ten seconds, with differences, all to seven places.  s

66 REPORT--1873.

   These are the same as Callet 1853 [T. IX. and X.] (§ 4), and were pub-

lished separately, De Morgan states, to accompany Babbage's logarithms of

numbers ; they are in consequence printed on yellow paper ; but it is, both
in colour and texture, very inferior to that used by Babbage.

   Airy, 1838. Log sines and cosines from O*" to 24'', at intervals of

10^ to 5 places. The proper sign is prefixed to each quantity : no dififer-

ences. The sines are on the left-hand pages, the cosines on the right-hand.

As was remarked by De Morgan, this is an eightfold repetition of one

table : it occupies 48 pp. The table is improperly described as having been
" computed under the direction " &c. : it is, of course, only a simple re-

arrangement.

   The following is a complete classified list of tables on the subject of

Art. 16. Tables of Hyperbolic Logarithms (viz. logarithms to base 2-71828. . .),

   The logarithms invented by Napier, and explained in the ' Descriptio
(1614) and ' Coustruetio ' (1619) (see § 3, art. 17), were uot the same as
                                                                                         ON MATHEMATICAL TABLES.  69

those now called h/jjei-holic (viz. to base e) and very frequently also Naj^ierian

logarithms. It is also to be noticed that JSTapier calculated no logarithms of
numbers. Jonx Speidell, 1019 (see below), first published logarithms to

base e bothof numbers and sines. The most complete table of hj'perbolic

logarithms is Base's, described below, which could be used, though not so

convenieutly, as an ordinary seven-figure Briggian table extending from 1000

to 105,000. It would sometimes be useful to have also a complete seven-

place table of hyperbolic logarithms of numbers from 1000 to 100,000, ex-

actly similar to the corresponding' Briggian tables, as in some cases it is con-

venient to perform calculations in duplicate, first by Briggian, and then by

hyperbolic logarithms                                                                    and such a table would be of use in multiplying- five
                                                                                      ;

figures by five figures : but hyperbolic logarithms cannot be rendered conve-

nient for general purposes.

The most elaborate hyperbolic logarithmic table is "Wolfkam's, which prac-

tically gives the hyperbolic logarithms of all numbers from unity to 10,000

ioforty-eiglit decimal places. It first appeared, we believe, in Schulze (§ 4),

and was reprinted in Vega, folio, 1794 (§ 4).
   Wolfram was a Dutch Ueutenant of artillery ; and his table represents six

years of very laborious work. Just before its completion he was attacked by
a serious illness ; and a few logarithms were in consequence omitted in Schuize

(see Introduction, last page but two, to vol. i. of Schulze). The omissions
were supplied in Vega's ' Thesaurus,' 1794. De Morgan speaks of Wolfram's

table as one of the most striking additions that have been made in the sub-

ject of logarithms in modern times.

Montucla (' Histoire,' vol. iii. p. 360) states that in 1781 Alexander Jom-

bert proposed to publish by subscription new tables of hyperbolic logarithms

to 21 places for all prime numbers to 100,000, with a table of all odd numbers

of two factors to the same limit. The author was Dom Vallej're, advised by
Dom Robe, benedictine of St. Maur. Only two hundred subscribers were re-

quired before the commencement of the printing, and nothing was asked in
advance; but the project fell through, no doubt for want of subscribers.

We infer from this account that the table was calculated.

The Catalogue of the Royal Society's Library contains, under the name of

Prony, the title, " Formules pour calculer I'efl'et d'une machine a vapeur a

detente et a un seul cylindre                                                            Tables de logarithmes hyperboliques calcu-

Speidell, 1619. Logarithmic sines, tangents, and secants, semiquadi-antally

arranged, to every minute, to five places. The logarithms are hyperbolic (viz.

to base e), and the first of the kind ever published. When the characteristic

is negative SpeideU adds 10 to it, and does not separate the characteristic so
increased from the rest of the figures by any space or mark. Thus he prints

the logarithm of the sine of 21° 30' as 899625, its true value being 2-99625
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

but the logarithm of the cotangent is given as 93163 ; it would now bo

written -93163. The Royal Society has " the 5-impression, 1623," with the
" Breefe Treatise of Sphaericall Triangles " prefixed, and also some ordinary

hj-perbolic logarithms of numbers (the first published) &c. On this see De

Morgan's long account of Speidell's works, who, however, had never seen the

edition of 1619, in which the canon occurs by itself without the logarithms

   Rees's Cyclopaedia, 1819 (Art. " Hyperbolic Logarithms," vol. xviii.).

Hyperbolic logarithms (to 8 places) of all numbers from 1 to 10,000, arranged

in groups of five.

   The table was calculated by Bablow, and appears also in hia mathema-

tical tables (1814).                    Hyperbolic logarithms, from

   Dase, 1850 (Hyperbolic Logarithms).

1 to 1000, at intervals of unity, and from 1000-0 to 10.500-0 at intervals

of 0-1 to seven places, with differences and proportional parts, arranged
as in an ordinary seven-figure table. The change of figure in the line is de-
noted by an asterisk prefixed to all the niimbers affected. The table is a
complete seven-place table, as by adding log 10 to the results the range
-is from 10,000 to 105,000 at intervals of unity. The table appeared in the
34th part (new series, t, xiv.) of the ' Annals of the Vienna Observatory'
(1851); but separate copies were printed, in the preface to which Dasegavc
six errata. This portion of the preface is reproduced in the introduction by
Littrow to the above volume of ' Annals.' The table was calciilated to ten

places, and three rejected. It was the author of this table who also com-

puted the factorial tables (§ 3, art. 8), and calculated the value of n cor-
rectly to 200 decimal places (Crelle's Journal, t. xxvii. p. 198).

The invention of logarithms has been accorded to Napier of Merchiston

with a unanimity not often met with in reference to scientific discoveries.

The only possible rival is Justus Byrgius, who seems to have constructed a

rude kind of logarithmic table ; but there is every reason to believe that

Napier's system was conceived and perfected before Byrge's in point of time
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

and in date of publication Napier has the advantage by six years. Further,

Byrge's system is greatly inferior to Napier's ; and to the latter alone is the

whole world indebted for the knowledge of logarithms, as (with the exception

of Kepler, one of the most enthusiastic of the contemporary admirers of

Napier and his system, who does allude to Byrge) no one ever suggested
any one else as having been the author whence they had drawn their

information, or as having anticipated Napier at all, tiU the end of the last

century, when Byrge's claim was first raised, though his warmest advocates

always assigned far the greater part of the credit of the invention to Napier.

On Byrge's claim see De Morgan's careful resume (article " Tables," under

Justus Byrgius, 1620, in the 'Eng. Cyclop.,' where references are given),

and Mr, Mark Napier's ' Memoirs of John Napier of Merchiston,' Edin-

burgh, 1834 (where the question how far Napier received any assistance

Wefrom his predecessors in the discovery is fully discussed).  have also seen

' Justus Byrg als Mathematiker und dessen Eiuleitung in seine Logarith-

men,' by Dr. Gieswald, Dantzig, 1856, 4to (pp. 36). Napier's ' Canonis

Logarithmorum Mirifici Descriptio ' (which contained the first announcement

and the first table of logarithms) was published in 1614 ; and in 1619 (two

years after his death, which occurred on April 4, 1617) appeared the ' Mirifici

logarithmoiTim Canonis Constructio,' edited by his son Robert, in which the
method of constructing the canon is explained. The various reprints and

translations of the ' Descriptio ' and ' Constructio ' are described under

Napier, 1614 and 1619 ; and the relations between Napier and Briggs with

regard to the invention of decimal logarithms are noticed in § 3, art. 13.

The most elaborate canon of Napierian logarithms is Ursinus (1624-1625),

described below.

   The diflference between the logarithms introduced Napier and hyperbolic

logarithms is explained under Napier (1614). We have paid considerable

attention to the early logarithmic tables, and have examined all of them that
were accessible to us ; and it is with some regret that we omit to notice them

in detail here : the accounts of the smaller tables that immediately suc-

ceeded Napier would be of only bibliographical or historical interest ; and to
describe them with sufiicient detaU to render the accounts of value would

occupy too much space. However, as the works of this period are very rare,

it is worth while remarking that there is a copy of Napier's * Constructio '

in the Cambridge University Library (there is none in the British Museum

or Royal Society's Library), where also are to be found Ursinus's ' Cursus ' of

1618, Speidell 1619, and Kepler 1624: we have generally, in describing

works of this date, mentioned the library containing the copy we have seen.

We have found De Morgan to be very accurate (except where he has had to

form his opinions from secondhand or imperfect evidence) ; and he has

'devoted much care to the early logarithmic tables, so that we feel the less

reluctance in omitting to notice them further here.

   Napier, 1614. The book consists of 57 pp. explaining the nature of

logarithms &c., and 90 pp. of tabular matter, giving natural sines and their
Napierian logarithms to every minute of the quadrant (seraiquadrantaUy

arranged) to seven or eight figures (seven decimals). Logarithmic tangents
are also given under the heading differenUce (they are the differences between

the sine and cosine, which, though the latter name is not used, are both on
the same line, as a consequence of the semiquadrantal arrangement of the

table).

   The logarithms introduced by Napier were not hyperbolic or Napierian
logarithms as we now understand these terms, viz. logarithms to the base e
(2-71828 . ), but somewhat difierent ; the relation between the two being

                                                     .

Nbetween (a sine) and L, its Napierian logarithm is therefore

--72 KEPORT 1873.

Athe logarithms therefore decrease as the sines increase.  hrief explanation

of the principle of Napier's own method is given by Professor Wackerbarth

in vol. xxxi. p. 263 (1871) of the 'Monthly Notices of the Royal Astro-

nomical Society.' The anthor of that communication there points out that

the description in most elementary books of Napierian logarithms, as loga-

rithms to the base e, is incorrect ; but this criticism appears to us irrelevant,

as by calling certain logarithms Napierian it is not asserted that they arc

used at present in the exact form in whicli they were presented by Napier.

A glance at the formula written above shows that all the essential features

of logarithms to the base e arc contained in Napier's system, and that there

is no impropriety in calling the former by his name. De Morgan says that

" Delambre proposed to call them [Napier's logarithmsj Napierian logarithms,

--and to restrict the term hj-pcrbolic to the modern or e logarithms ; but

custom has refused," and no doubt very properly, as, except in mathematical

histories &e., there is no occasion to distinguish the two systems from one

another. For our own part, we should much prefer to see natural or

hyperbolic and common logarithms universally called Napierian uni Brigr/ian,

after the two great founders of logarithmic tables.

  A translation of Napier's ' Canon Mirificus ' was made by Edward "Wright

(well known in connexion with the history of navigation), and, after his death,

Apublished by his son at London in 1616, under the title " Description of

the admirable Table of Logarithmes, &c." (12mo). Ou account of the rarity

of this work and the ' Constructio,' the full titles of both are given in § 5.
There is a short " Preface to the Reader " by Briggs, and a description of a

triangular diagram invented by Wright for finding the proportional parts.

Napier's table, however, is printed to one figure less than in the ' Canon

Mirificus ' throughout. The edition was revised by Napier himself. On

Wright, see Introduction to Button's ' Mathematical Tables.' The ' Canon

Mirificus ' was also rej)rinted by Maseres in the sixth volume of the ' Scrip-

tores Logarithmici ' (1791-1807); and in 1857 Mr. Filipowski published

at Edinburgh a translation of the same work (full title given in § 5 ; the tone
of the Introduction renders any comment on it unnecessary).

   Both the ' Deseriptio ' (the ' Canon Mirificus ') and the ' Constructio '
were reprinted by Bartholomew Vincent at Lyons in 1620 (who thus first

published logarithms on the Continent), the title of the former appearing on

the titlepage as " Logarithmorum Canonis Deseriptio, sen Arithmeticarum

supputationura mirabilis abbreviatio. Ejusquc ususin utraque Trigonometria

ut etiam in omni Logistica Mathematica, amplissimi, facillimi &, expeditissimi

centium, M.DC.XX. Cum privilegio Cffisar. Majest. & Christ. Galliarum

Regis." The full title of Napier's original edition of 1614 is given in § 5 ;
and it will be seen that it is very difi'erent from that written above. Yery
many writers (including Montucla) give the title of Vincent's reprint as that

of the original work. There is an imperfect copy of Vincent's reprint,

containiug only the * Deseriptio ' (the * Constructio ' having been torn out),

in the British Museum ; but the Royal Society has a perfect copy. Wright's

translation of 1616 is in the British Museum.

   On the accuracy of Napier's Canon see Delambre, * Astron. Mod.,' t. i.

p. .501. Mr. Mark Napier's 'Memoirs of John Napier' gives nearly all that
is known with regard to Napier's life, MSS., &c. ; but it is told in a verbose

and diff'use manner, and written in a partisan spirit as regards Briggs.

Logistica Joannis Naperi Merchistonii Baronis libri qui'supcrsuut," edited by

Mr. Mark Napier. An historical sketch, mainly derived from the same

author's ' Memoirs,' is prefixed. In 1787 was also published ' An account

of the Life, Writings, and Inventions of John Napier of Merchiston,' by

David Stewart, Earl of Buchan, and Walter Minto, LL.D. Perth, 4to. See

also Phil. Mag. Suppl. No., December, 1872, " On some early Logarithmic

Tables." Leslie (' Philosophy of Arithmetic,' 2nd edit., 1820, p. 24(3)
describes Napier's work as " a very small duodecimo ;" the last word should

be " quarto." The page is 7*7 inches by 5*7 inches.

  We may remark that Napier's name is spelt in a variety of Avays ; we

have seen Neper, Naper, Nepair, and Nepper. He always Latinized his

name into Neperus or Naperus, but spelt it in the vernacular several ways.

' The family now write the name Napier; and this spelling is generally

adopted, and with good reason.

Napier, 1619 (' Constructio '). This work contains no table, and is there-

Wefore not properly included in this Report.                                   have, however, noticed it on

account of its being a sequel to the ' Descriptio,' and also on account of its

rarity (the fuU title is given in § 5). The only copy we have seen (in the

Cambridge University Library), which belonged to Oughtred, contains two

titlepages, the first running " Mirifici logarithmorum canonis descriptio. . .

infer that a reprint of the ' Descriptio ' (1619) was prefixed to the

' Constructio,' but that it was torn out from the copy we have examined.

On the reprints, &c. of the ' Constructio,' see under Napier, 1614.

Ursinus, 1624--1625. A canon exactly similar to Napier's in the

' Canon Mirificus,' 1614, only much enlarged. The intervals of the argu-

ments are 10" ; and the results are given to eight places : in Napier's canon

the intervals are 1', and the number of places is 7. The logarithms are strictly

Najplerian, and the arrangement is identical with that in the canon of 1614.

This is the largest Napierian canon that has been calculated. The copy we

have seen is in the British Museum. In 1618 Ursinus published his

* Cursus Mathematicus,' of which there is a copy in the Cambridge Uni-

versity Library.

   The only table of Napierian logarithms described in § 4 is Schulze, 1778

        What arc now called fractions or ratios used to be styled logistic numbers

     and logistic logarithms are logarithms of ratios : thus a table of log -, x

[ being the argument and o a constant, would be called a table of logistic or

   = --proportional logarithms ; and since log - log o log x, it is clear that the

      tabular results only differ from those of an ordinary table of logarithms by the
      subtraction of a constant and a change of sign. It appears that Kepler, in
      his ' Chilias ' described below, originated tables of this kind ; but the step that

     separates logistic from common logarithms is so small that no great interest

     attaches to their first appearance. The use of the tabulation of log - in the

     working of proportions in which the third term is a fixed quantity a is evident.

74 REPORT 1873.

There seems a tendency to keep the name logistic logarithms for those tables

= = --in which a 3600" 1° (so that the table gives log 3600 log .r, x being

expressed in minutes and seconds), and to use the ndirae proportional logarithms

when a has any other value. We have not met with any modern table of

this kind forming a separate work ; and such tables are usually of no great
extent. They are to be found, however, in many collections of tables ; and the
logistic logarithms from Callet were published separately at Nuremberg in

a tract of 9 pp. in 1843 (see title in § 5).

   It may be remarked that tables of log - often extend to values of x
                                                            X

greater than a ; and then, in the portion of the table for which this is the
case, the mantissae are rendered positive (by the supposed addition of the

--characteristic 1, which is omitted) before tabulation,

  Kepler, 1624. We cannot do better than foUow De Morgan's example,

and give a specimen of the table, which contains five columns :

                                         53- 36-36 80500-00 19- 19-12 21691-30 48-18

                                         5-48    124-15

The sinus or numerus dhsolutus is 805, which (to a radius 1000) is the

--gine of 53° 36' 36", and the Napierian logarithm is 2169130. The third and

fifth columns are explained as follows : if 1000 represent 24'', then 805

represents 19*" 19"" 12' ; and if 1000 represents 60°, then 805 represents

48° 18'                                  there are intorscript differences for the first and fourth columns.
                                      ;

Thus, as De Morgan remarks, Kepler originated logistic logarithms. Kepler's

tract is reprinted by Maseres in vol. i. of his ' Scriptores Logarithmici
(1791); and there is also reprinted there " Joannis Keplcri .... supple

mentum chiliadis logarithmorum . . . .Marpurgi, 1625," the original of which
we have not seen, but it contains no table. The copy of the 1624 work Ave

have described is iu the Cambridge University Library, For an account of

Kepler's ' Tabulae Rudolphinae,' see De Morgan.

Proportional logarithms for every second, a being 3°, are given almost

invariably in collections of nautical tables, usually to four places, but some-

times to five. T. 74 of Raper, so frequently referred to in § 4, is a four-

place table of this kind, and was, as we have seen stated in several places, first
computed by Maskelyne. The reference was made to Raper rather than

to any other of the numerous places where it occurs, as his work on

Navigation is one of the best-known, and has been through numerous

editions. Prof. Everett (Phil. Mag, Nov. 1866) says, quoting Raper, that

proportional logarithms as at present used are a source of perpetual mis-

takes even to expert computers ; but this must be intended to apply

rather to practical men, as for the mathematical calculator they are very

convenient.

The following is a list of tables on the subject of this article, which are

described more fiiUy in § 4.

               Art. 19. Tables of Gaussian Logarithms.

    Gaussian logarithms have for their object to facilitate the finding of the

logarithms of the sum and difference of two numbers whose logarithms are
known, the numbers being themselves unknown ; on this account they are
often called Addition and Subtraction logarithms. The problem is therefore ·

±given log a and log 6, find log (a b) by the taking out of only one logarithm.

The utility of such logarithms was first pointed out by Leonelli, in a very

scarce book printed at Bordeaux in the year XI. (1802 or 1803), under the

--title " Supplement logarithmique ;" but it met with no success. Leonelli's idea

was to construct a table to 14 places an extravagant extent, as Gauss has re-
marked. The first table constructed was calculated by Gauss, and published
by him in vol. xxvi. (p. 498 et seq.) of Zach's ' Monatliche Correspondenz '

A = = +(1812) : it gives B and C for argument A, where
                                                                             Blog a?,         log 1 1  -

= + = A + WeC log (1 x), so that C
                      B ; and the use is as follows.                                                   have

identically

               = ^+ ++log (a b) log a log (l

                      = Blog rt -f-        for argument log -

                                          I j.

The rule therefore is, to take log a, the larger of the two logarithms,
--and to enter the table with log a logb as argument, we then have
+ = + = +log (a b) log n B, or, if we please, log 6 C. For the difference,
-- + Athe formula is log (a b) =log b
                                          (argument sought in column C) if
-- = -- Alog rt log 6 is greater than -30103, and log 6
--column B) if log a                                                            (argument sought in

                      log 6 is less than  -30103                             there are  also  other  forms.
                                                                          ;

Gauss remarks that a complete seven-figure table of this kind would be very

useful. Such a table was formed by Matthiessen ; but the arrangement is

such that very little is gained by the use of it. This Gauss has pointed out

in No. 474 of the ' Astronomische Nachrichten,' 1843, and in a letter (1846)

to Schumacher, quoted by De Morgan. Gauss's papers on logarithms and

reviews of logarithmic tables from the ' Gottingische gelehrte Anzeigen,'

* Astronomische Nachrichten,' &e., are reprinted together on pp. 241-264 of

t. iii. of his ' Werke,' 1866. Of these pp. 244-252 have reference to Gaussian

logarithms and contain reviews of Pasquich, 1817 (§. 4), and Matihiessen,

1818 (below). The largest tables are Zech (reprinted from Hulsse's edition
of Vega) and Wittstein, which answers the purpose Gauss had in view the
best of all : there is also a good introduction to the latter (in French and
German), explaining the use and objects of the tables.

   Whenever in this Eeport the letters A, B, C are used in the description
of Gaussian logarithms, they are always supposed to have the meanings
assigned to them by Gauss (which are explained above), unless the con-
trary is expressly stated. Of course all Gaussian tables have reference to

Briggian (not hyperbolic) logarithms.

Leonelli, 1806. This is the German translation of Leonelli's work, and

suggested to Gauss the construction of his table in Zach's ' Correspondenz.'

The book consists of two parts : in the first there are 9 pages of tables &c.

wanted in the construction of logarithms, viz. log cc, log 1-x, log (1-Oa-), . . . .
=log (l-OOOOOOOOOO.r), for x 1, 2,
                                        9, to 20 places, and the same for

hyperbolic logarithms; also log -1, -2  (9-9), and log l-Oo:, log l-OOOo--,

=log 1-OOOOO.r, and log 1-OOOOOOO.r, for x 01, 02, ... . 99.

The second part is headed " Theorie der Ergiinzungs- und Verminderungs-

Logarithmen zur Berechnung der Logarithmen der Summen und Differenzen

yon Zahlen aus ihren Logarithmen," and on pp. 52-54 the specimen table is

+ +given ;
log x being the argument, it gives log 1                                                                                                    - and log (1  x) as

intervals of -00001. [It wiU be noticed that the above are the same as

Gauss's A, B, and C] The middle page of this table (p. 53) is nearly an

inch longer than any of the other pages of the book. The original work,

according to Houel, 1858, ^ Avertissement,' p. vi, was published at Bordeaux,

to 3-40 at intervals of -01, and to 5-0 at intervals of -1, all to 5 places, with

differences. The table occupies 27 small octavo pages. Gauss's paper is re-

printed from the ' Correspondenz ' in t. iii. pp. 244--246 of his ' Werke,'

1866 ; but the table is not reproduced there.

Matthiessen, 1818. B and C are given to 7 places for argument A,
A =from
         -0000 to 2-0000 at intervals of -0001, thence to 3-000 at intervals

of -001, to 4-00 at intervals of -01 and to 5-0 at intervals of -1 ; also for

the arrangement is, column of A, column of first four figures of B, column of

first four figures of C, column of last three figures of B and C, proportional

parts ; the eye has therefore to look in two different columns to take out a

logarithm. There is also another disadvantage, viz. that as there are only

four figures of argument, if it is to be used as a seven-figure table three more

must be interpolated for.

The introduction is both in German and Latin.

Mr. Gray, who recalculated a considerable portion of this table, found that

it contained numerous errors (see Gray, 1849, below). See also the intro-

ductoi-y remarks to this article.

incomplete, by reason of the reciprocitj' referred to above, since for arguments

less than '382 we can take B as the argument. Thus, at the beginning of

The first table might have been copied from ITatthiessen by contracting the

7 places of the latter to 6 ; but it was recalculated by Mr. Gray, and many

errors were thereby found in Matthiessen's table (Introduction, p. vi) ; the
second t<able was also tke result of an original calculation. Some remarks

and references on the subject of Gaussian logarithms &c. will be found in

the Introduction to the work.

every hundredth of the differences added : the whole of course the result of

an original calculation. Mr. Peter Gray was the first to perceive the utility

of Gaussian logarithms in the calculation of life contingencies, and to him is

due their introduction as well as the calculation of the necessary tables, which

it is evident are valuable mathematically, apart from the particular subject

for which they were undertaken.

AH the tables of proportional parts (described in § 3, art. 2) are

interpolation tables in one, and that the most usual, sense ; and similarly^

Wemultiplication and product tables may be so regarded (see § 3, art. 2).

may, however, especially refer to Scheon, 1860, as its printed title describes

--it as an interpolation table a designation not common. The only separate

table we have seen for facilitating interpolations, when the second, third, &c.

Wedifferences are included, is "Woolhottse, noticed below.  may also refer

to Godwaed's tables (title in § 5), but they seem of such special application

that we have not thought it necessary to describe their contents.

   Woolhouse, 1865. Papers extracted from vols, xi, and xii. of thd

* Assurance Magazine.' There are 9 pp. of interpolation tables (viz. pp.
14-22) . The work contains a clear explanation of methods of interpolation,

with developments.

                                       Art. 22. Mensuration Tables.

  We have made no special search for tables on mensuration (such as areas

of circles of given radius, volumes of cones of given base and altitude, &c.),

and have only included those that have fallen in our way in the course of

seeking for more strictly mathematical tables during the preparation of this
Report. As, however, for several reasons it seems desirable that a complete

list of such tables should be formed, we shall endeavour to render this
Article as nearly perfect as we can in the supplement. One reason, how-

ever, wh)^ such tables are not of very high mathematical value is that the
measures are generally expressed in more or less arbitrary units, such as yards,
feet, inches, &c., or metres &c.

  We may especially refer to the large table of circular segments in Sharp,

1717 (§ 4).

   Sir Jonas Moore (1660?). The table is a very small one, and

scarcely occupies a third of a folio page. It gives the periphery of an
ellipse for one axis as argument (the other axis being supposed equal to,
unity) to 4 places, with differences ; the range of the argument is from -00,
to 1-00 at intervals of -01. Thus, to find the perimeter of an ellipse, axes 1

and -78, we enter the table at 78 and find 2-8038. If oue axis is not equal

to iinity, a simple proportion of course gives the perimeter. After working^

out four examples, the author proceeds : " I have made above 45,000 arith*-
metieal operations for this table, and am now well pleased it is finished..

    T. IV. The same from diameter "1 to 100 at intervals of 4. Areas to 6

places, circumferences to 5.

    T. V. to VII. stand in exactly the same relation to spheres that T. I. to

IV. do to circles, except that T. V. is equivalent to T. I. and II., the
intervals being ^ from 1 to 100 ; and T. VI. commences at 1 (not 12), The
volumes and superficies are given to 4 places.

    T, VIII. Areas (exact) and diagonals (to 5 places) of squares for side as
argument, from g to 100 at intervals of ^.

and cubic inches ; but in T. III. and VI. the corresponding numbers of
linear, square, and cubic feet are also given.

   The original work, of which this is the second and greatly augmented
edition, was published in 1826 ; and the tables were the result of original
calculations. There are besides some specific gravities, &c.

Art. 23. Dual Logarithms.

Dual logarithms were invented, and the tables of them calculated, by Mr.

Oliver Byrne, who, besides the work described below, has published ' Dual

AArithmetic ' and the ' Young Dual Arithmetician ' on the subject.  dual

number of the ascending scale is a continued product of powers of 1*1, l-Ol,

I'OOl, &c., taken in order, the powers only being expressed. To distinguish

these numbers from ordinary numbers, they are preceded by the sign \|/ :

= =thus, \i/ 6, 9, 7, 6 (M)»(l-01)' (1-001)^ (l-OOOl)" ; n,]/ 0, 0, 2 (1-1)°

(1-01)° (1-001)^, the numbers following the \j/ being called dual digits.
"When all but the last digit of a dual number are zeros, the dual number is

called a dual logarithm ; but the dual logarithms used by Mr. Byrne are " of

the eighth position," viz. there are 7 ciphers between the \|/ and the

logarithm.

  A dual number of the descending branch is a continued product of powers

of -9, -99, -999, &c., and the dual number is followed by the symbol /|\

= =thus, (-9)3 (-99)2 '3 '2 /|\; (-999)= (-999999)2 '0' 0' 3' 0' 0' 2 /|\. In the

descending branch also a dual number reduced to the eighth position is
                     ON MATHEMATICAL TABLES.                                                                                  81

called a dual logarithm, and is to be considered negative if the ascending
dual logarithm is taken positive, and vice versa.

Byrne, 1867. T. I. contains aU the dual numbers of the ascending

branch of dual arithmetic from \|/ 0, 0, 0, 1 to \|/ 7, 3, 1, 9, and their
corresjjonding dual numbers and natural numbers. The range of the dual

logarithms is from 00000 to 69892175, and of the natural numbers from

1-00000000 to 2-01167234. Marginal tables are added, by means of which

all dual numbers of 8 digits, and their corresponding dual logarithms and

natural numbers, may be derived : the table occupies 74 pp.

   T. II. Dual logarithms and dual numbers of the descending branch of

dual arithmetic from '0 '0 '0 '1 '0 '0 '0 '0 /|\ to '3 '6 '9 '9 '0 '0 '0 '0 /|\ with

corresponding natural numbers. The range of the dual logarithms is from

'10001 to '39633845, and of the natural numbers from -99990000 to

·67277805. Marginal tables are added, by means of which all intermediate

dual numbers of 8 digits and their corresponding dual logarithms and natural

numbers may be derived. This table is printed in red, T. I. and III. being

in black. It occupies 38 pp.
    T. III. Natural sines and arcs to 7 places for every minute of the

quadrant. The length of the arc is, of course, the circular measure of the

angle, so that we have a table of circular measures to minutes : the arrange-

ment is quadrantal.  Proportional  parts  are given for  10", 20".                                                      .90"  for

each difference ; and these occupy two thirds of the page. There are small

proportional-part tables for the arc : the table occupies 90 pp.
   The author claims that his tables are incomparably superior to those of

common logarithms, and asserts that " these tables are equal in power to

Babbage's and Callet's, and take up less than one eighth of the space "

('Dual Arithmetic,' part ii. p. ix). Bahhage and Callet seems an error

(unless the Callex of 1827 (§ 3, art. 15) is meant), as the latter work con-
tains the table of the logarithms of numbers which is the sole contents of the

--former. Mr. Byrne's works on the subject are : ' Dual Arithmetic : a new

Art,' London, 1863, 8vo (pp. 244) ; ' Dual Arithmetic : a new Art. New

Issue, with a complete analysis,' 1864 (pp. 83) [this work contains a table
of 3 pp., " to facilitate the conversion of dual numbers into common ones, or
the converse "] ; ' Dual Arithmetic: a new Art. Part the Second ' (pp. 218),
and the work above described. Mr. Byrne has also published ' The Dual
Doctrine of Angular Magnitude and Functions, &c.,' and the ' Young Dual

Arithmetician,' neither of which we have seen : the latter contains an

abridgment to 3 dual digits of the tables in the work described above.

In spite of the somewhat extravagant claims advanced by the author for

his system, dual logarithms have found but little favour as yet either from

mathematicians or computers.

                                   Art. 24. Matliematical Cotistants.

In nearly all tables of logarithms there is a page devoted to certa^

frequently used constants and their logarithms, such as n, -, tt-, i/n, aYt:,

&c., the radius of the circle in degrees, minutes, &c., the modulus &c.

There are not generally more than four or five logarithms involving tt given ;

and usually half the page is devoted to constants relatiug to the conversion

of weights and measures. It is only necessary, therefore, here to refer to

works in which tliere is a better collection than usual of constants.

--83 REPORT 1873.

A very good collection is given by Matnaed (described below), and

also by Byrne, 1849. This portion of the present Eeport is very far from

complete, as the values of mathematical constants have, as a rule, appeared in

periodical publications, while those only that are most used by the general

Wecomputer are to be found in collections of mathematical tables.  refrain,

therefore, from giving references to several periodicals we have met with

containing constants, as they belong properly to a subsequent portion of the

Report ; and it is hoped that, after the completion of the examination of

the memoirs, a pretty complete list, either of the constants themselves, or at

all events of the places where they are to be found, will be given.

  We may, however, notice a paper of Paucker's in the first volume of

' Grunert's Archiv der Mathematik und Physik,' in which a number of

constants involving tt are given to a great many places, and Gauss's

memoirs on the lemniscate-functions (' Werke,' t. iii. pp. 426 &c.), where

e~^, e~^^, e~^'^, &c. are calculated to about fifty places. On Euler's con-

stant, see ' Proceedings of the Eoyal Society,' t. xv. p. 429 ; t. xvi. pp. 154,
299 ; t. xviii. p. 49 (Shanks) ; t. xix. p. 514 (Glaisher) ; t. xx. pp. 27, 29

(Shanks). On e, the base of the Napierian logarithms, log^2, log^S &c., see,

besides the places just referred to, ' Poy. Soc. Proc' t. vi. p. 397, and ' Brit.

Assoc. Report' (Sections) 1871, p. 16, and also Shanks 1853 (§ 4). Several
constants are to be found in the different works of Maseres. Mr. Maynard

mand Mr. Merrifield have independently calculated log^M and log^??i (M and

being the modulus and its reciprocal) to 30 places (' Assurance Magazine,'

t. vi. p. 298).

   The value of it has been calculated to 500 places of decimals by Shanks
and Richter independently, and to 707 places by the former alone : see
references, ' Messenger of Mathematics,' December 1872 and July 1873. Mr.

Shanks's latest value appears in the ' Roy. Soc. Proc' t. xxi. p. 319.
It is proper here to remark that Rutherford's 208-decimal value of tt, given
in the ' Phil. Trans.' 1841, p. 283, is erroneous after the 152nd place : this

value is reproduced in BniNE, 1849 (§ 4), and in Matnakd; so that it is

erroneous also in both of these works.

A[Maynard.]  good table of constants involving tt, such as tt V2, tt "^

Vtt, &c., and some few involving e &c., to a great many (generally 30)

places. There are also other constants not included in the subjects of this

Report.

The copy of these constants that we examined consisted of six leaves

without a cover, and which were evidently extracted from some work. Mr^

C. W. Merrifield, E.R.S., subsequently called our attention to the particil-

larly good collection of constants in ' The Millwright and Engineers' Pocket

Companion ; . . . . By William Templeton .... Corrected by Samuel May-

nard. . . . Eifteenth edition, carefully revised,' London, 1871, 8vo, and lent

us a copy ; and on examination it appeared that it was to this work that

Maynard's collection belonged, where it occupies pp. 169-180. There are,
altogether, 58 constants involving tt, and their logarithms, given generally to

30 places, and 13 others that may also be properly styled mathematical. It

is mentioned that part of the table had previously appeared in Keith's

' Measurer ' (twenty-fourth edition, 1846). Templeton's work contains several

other tables (areas of circles, &c.), and square roots which would have been

included in this Report had we seen the book earlier ; as it is they will be
noticed in the Supplement. On Rutherford's value of tt, quoted by May-

nard, see introductory remarks to this article.

however, a long one, as we have frequently placed doubtful tables in the

Phillips, 1829. This is not properly a table at all. Names and an

abbreviated way of writing them are suggested for all numbers up to 9

followed by 4000 figures, the chief peculiarity of the system being that 1000

is called ten hundred, and 10,000 a thousand, and so on. The only

explanation of the object of the table is contained in the curiously untrue

remark that, by adopting the author's names, " we obtain a clearer view of

calculations which are generally called inconceivable only because we have

hitherto adopted no terms to express and hmit them." On Sir R. Phillips,

and the value of his works, see De Morgan's 'Budget of Paradoxes' (1872),

Academie de Prusse (1776). This collection of tables only contains

two that come within the scope of this Report.

   [T. I.] (vol. iii. pp. 172-207). Table of sines, expressed as arcs whose

length is equal to that of the sine ; viz. for x (expressed in degrees and mi-

nutes) as argument there is given the angle (expressed in degrees, minutes,

seconds, and tenths of a second) whose circular measure is sin x, the argu-
ment X being given to every minute of the quadrant. There are no differ-

ences ; and the arrangement of the table is quadrantal (not semiquadrantal).
The table is due to Schulze.

[T. II.] (Vol. iii. pp. 258-271). Lengths of circular arcs, viz. the circular

measures of 1°, 2°, 3°,  360°, of 1', 2', . · . . 60', and of 1", 2",    60" to

27 places. This table is by Schulze, in whose collection it also appears : see
Schulze [T. VII.].

Both these tables are included under the head " Tables auxiliaires " in the

third volume.

The whole work is attributed in the Royal Society's Catalogue to Schulze,

and, from internal evidence we have little doubt, correctly.

  --Appendix. Table of log sines and tangents for every second of the qua-

drant to seven places (without differences). The change in the middle of the
column is beautifully clearly marked by a large black nucleus, surrounded by

a circle, printed instead of zero. Only the first logarithm affected is so de-
noted ; but the mark is so striking that it readily attracts the eye. The table
was formed by interpolation from Callet, corrected by Taylor (see p. ii of
the ' Avertissement ') ; 76 errors were thus found in Taylor. Some errata
are given at the end of the work.

   All the other tables are astronomical. This work, which has now become
rare, is much esteemed.

   These tables occupy 256 pp., and are followed by 78 pp. of formulae, weights,
and measures, &c.

There is a full introduction, stating whence the tables were derived, or, if

computed, from what formulae, ifec. The hyperbolic logarithms were taken

from "Wolfeam's table in Schulze ; and the reciprocals, factors, square and
cube roots, and several other ^tables were the result of independent cal-

culations.

The squares, cubes, square and cube roots, and reciprocals from this table

were reprinted and stereotyped, at the suggestion of De Morgan, in 1840 (see

Barloav's tables, 1840, in § 3, art. 4). The reprint thus gives T. I., the

Acolumn of factors being omitted.      list of 90 errors in T. I. of the original

work is given in the reprint ; and 25 errors in T. YI. are given by Prof.

Wackerbarth in the ' Monthly Notices of the Eoyal Astronomical Society ' for

April 1867.

[T. n.] Log sines and tangents (to 5 places), and natural sines and tan-

gents (to 7 places), for every minute of the quadrant, semiquadrantally

arranged: no differences.

   The tables (which have a separate titlepage, bearing the date 1779) are
preceded by 211 pp. of trigonometry, and followed by an Appendix on the

motion of projectiles in a non-resisting medium. The work was intended for
use in the Military Academy, Belmont, near Dublin.

   Beardmore, 1862. Only 23 pages (pp. 84-106) of this work contain

square and cube roots being given as far as 1100.

T. 36. Six-figure logarithms of numbers from 100 to 1000.
T. 37. Log sines from 0° to 4-5° 50', at intervals of 10', to 6 places.

form, was issued in 1851.

   Beverley [1833?] T. VI. (p. 127). Any number of minutes less than

12'' expressed as a decimal of 12'', to 4 places.

T. VI. (pp. 232-243). Sexagesimal cosecants and cotangents for every

Aminute from 20° to 90°.    sexagesimal cotangent is the cotangent when

=the radius is taken 60' (or 1°); viz. it bears to 60' the same ratio that the

ordinary cotangent does to unity, and is usually expressed in minutes, seconds,

and decimals of a second. The same, of course, holds for sines, cosines, &c.

Thus the sexagesimal sine of 30° is 30', cosecant 30°= 120', &c.

   In this table the quantities tabulated are not sexagesimal functions, but

sexagesimal functions divided by 3 (and are therefore to radius 20') : we thus
have cosec 30°=40'. The table is given to two decimal places of a second.

   T. XV. Sexagesimal sines, tangents, secants, and versed sines (viz. to rad.

60') to every degree to 90°, to one decimal place of a second, with differences.

--83 REPORT 1873.

Mr. Beverley made some improvements in Tatior's Sexagesimal Table

(§ 3, art. 9), and devised a plan to introduce them into Taylor's table without

reprinting it. He accordingly made application to the Board of Admiralty to

be allovred to do so in the copies that remained unsold ; but this was refused.

He then offered to purchase all the unsold copies of Htjtton's ' Products

and Taylor's tables, in order to introduce his improvements ; but his applica-

tion was refused after the terms had been agreed upon, because he asked for

six months' credit. In the Appendix he complains that " the immense

labour that the calculation of his tables required him to exert had then ruined

his constitution, and brought him to the verge of a prematui-e grave." It is

to be presumed tliat the Admiralty had some grounds for their refusal ; but

it is certain that no use has been made of Hutton or Taylor since the time of

Mr. Beverley's application. No pains at any time seem to have been taken

to circulate or make known any of the books published by the Board of

Longitude, so that none of them have ever come into general use.

Mr. Beverley died in 1834, at the age of 39 ; and the present work was

published after his death, as it contains a notice of his life by " J. B.", and

evident traces of revision. He often refers to his Taylor's Sexagesimal Table,

Webut no doubt it was never published.      have seen 'The Book of Formulae

&c., Cirencester, 1838,' by the same author                                                                                                                                                                                 but it contains no tables.

Borda and Delambre, An IX. (1800 or 1801). [T. I.] Seven-figure

logarithms of numbers from 10,000, to 100,000, with differences and pro-

portional parts for aU. The line is broken when a change takes place in

the middle of it. It may be remarked that while in all modern tables

of logaritlims of numbers three figures are common to the block, and

four only are given in the columns, in this table there are but two leading

fig-ures, and five are found in the columns, so that the lines are broken in

very few instances. [T. II.] Eleven-figure logarithms of numbers to 1000,

and from 100,000 to 102,000 (the latter vsdth differences).

[T. III.] Log sines, cosines, tangents, and cotangents for centesimal argu-

ments, viz. from 0' to 10", at intervals of 10", and from 0' to 50", at in-

tervals of 10' to 11 places, without differences (", ', " being used to denote

.centesimal degrees (or grades as they are sometimes called), minutes, and

seconds).

[T. IV.] Hyperbolic logarithms of numbers from 1 to 1000 to 11 places.

[T. v.] Log differences of sines for every 1", 2", . . . 10" throughout the

quadrant, and the same for tangents for 1" and 2", to 7 places, viz. log

sin 2" -log sin 1", log sin 3" -log sin 2"                                                                                                                                                                                  throughout the quadrant of

100", logsin 4"-log sin 2", log sin 6"-- log sin 4" throughout the quadrant,

&c. It is to be noticed, however, that in this mode of description of the

--table log sin 0" must be treated throughout as instead of oo ; for facing

1" we have given log sin 1" (not log sin 1"-- log sin 0") in the first column;

jand facing 2" in the second we have log sin 2" &c.

full proportional parts for every 10").

   A page of tables for converting sexagesimals into centesimals &c., com-

pletes the work, which is a thick small-sized quarto, with clearly printed
and not too heavy pages. After the printing of the work Prony asked
Delambre to examine the Tables du Cadastre (Avhich are to every 10"

throughout. the quadrant to 12 places ; but see § 3, art. 13) ; and this gave
Delambre the opportunity of reading them with Borda's table of sines and

tangents in this work : the result was the detection of a great number of
last-place errors, which are given on pp. 117-119 (see p. 114, Preface de

I'cditeur). There are other errata given on p. 116.

   De Morgan remarks that Delambre is wrong in saying that Hobeet and

Idelee's tables, 1799 (§ 4), subdivided the quadrant as minutely as those
which he and Borda had published ; but this is not the case, as the latter
are as stated above. The mistake is one into which any one accustomed
to describing tables would naturally fall, as the mode of arrangement gives

the impression that the portion of [T. VI.] to 3" is to every second, and that
that from 3" to 40^ is to every ten seconds : at first sight it is not easy to see

why this was not the form of table adopted ; but the reason for the arrange-

ment being as it is was no doubt that the sine and cosecant, tangent and co-
tangent might be placed exactly on the same footing, as the proportional
parts are the same for each pair. [Mr. Lewis, of Mount Vernon, Ohio, men-
tions that Bremiker has fallen into the same mistake as De Morgan did, thus
giving additional proof of how misleading is the arrangement of the table to
those who have not had occasion to use it : see ' Monthly Notices of the

Eoyal Astronomical Society,' May 1873, vol. xxxiii, pp. 455-458.]

to 100,010, with proportional parts ; with degrees, minutes, and seconds
corresponding to every tenth number of seconds, and ten times each such
number; the change in the line is denoted by a bar over the 3rd figure
in all the logarithms affected. The table is followed by the first hundred
 multiples of the modulus ·434 . . . and its reciprocal to 7 places.

    T. II. Log sines (left-hand pages) and tangents (right-hand pages) for
 every second to 5° to 6 places, and log sines and tangents for every ten
 seconds of the quadrant to 6 places, with differences, and proportional parts
 beyond 5°. This is followed by small tables giving the circular measure of
 1°, 2° . . . 180°, 1', 2', . . . , 60', 1", 2". . . 60" to 6 places; and for the
 conversion of arc into time &c. The last page contains a few constants.

    There is an introduction of 82 pp., containing, among other things, an in-
 vestigation " De erroribus, quibus computationes logarithmicae afficiuntur."

    Nine errors in this work are pointed out by Prof. Wackerbarth in the
 ' Monthly Notices of the lloyal Astronomical Society " for April 1867.

from 10,000 to 100,000, with differences and all the proportional parts on the

page. The change of figure in the line is denoted by a bar placed over the

fourth figures of all the logarithms affected. S and T (see § 3, art. 13) are

given at the bottom of the page, as also are the numbers of degrees, minutes,

and seconds corresponding to every tenth number in the number-column of

the table. At the end of this table is a table containing the first hundred

multi])les of the modulus -434 . . . and its reciprocal 2-302 ... to 7 places.
   T. II. Log sines and tangents from 0° to 5° to every second, to seven

places : no differences. At the end of this table is given a page of circular

arcs, containing the circular measure of 1°, 2°, . . . 180°; 1', 2', . . . 60'; 1",
2 ', . . . 60" to seven places.

T. III. Log sines and tangents for every ten seconds of the quadrant, to

seven places, with differences : proportional parts are added after 5°.

T. III. is followed by a page containing tables for the conversion of arc

into time : the other tables are astronomical. On p. 547 are a few con-

stants. The tables are stereotyped.

An edition with an English Introduction, edited by Prof. W. L. F.

Fischer, was published in 1857 (title in § 5) ; the contents are the same as
in the above work, the tables being printed from the same plates.

   Bruhns, 1870. T. I. Seven-figure logarithms of numbers to 1000, and

from 10,000 to 100,000, with differences, and all the proportional parts.
The all is printed in italics, because in Eabbage, Callet, &c. only every other

table of proportional parts near the beginning of the table is given, for want

of space.

In this work there is no inconvenient crowding, as even where the side-tables

are very numerous, the type, though small, is still very clear. The constants

y and T, for the calculation of sines and tangents (§ 3, art. 13), are added,
and placed at the bottom of the page, as also are the numbers of degrees,

minutes, and seconds in every tenth number of the number-column (regarded

as that number of seconds), and the same for each of these numbers multi-

pHed by 10.

   T. II. Log sines, cosines, tangents, and cotangents to every second from
0° to 6°, to seven places, with differences throughout, and. proportional parity,

except in the portion of the table from 10' to 1° 20', where the size of the

page would not admit of their insertion.

T. III. Log sines, cosines, tangents, and cotangents from 6° to 45° to

every ten seconds, to seven places, with differences and proportional parts.
Of course room could not be found for the proportional parts of all the dif-

ferences                                but throughout all the table  on   no    page  are  there  less  than  six
                                     ;

proportional-part tables.

On p. 186 tlie first hundred multiples of the modulus and its reciprocal

are given, to ten places ; and at the end of the book are tables of circular arcs,

viz. the circular measure of 1°, 2°, . . . 180°, 1', 2', . . . 60', 1", 2", . . . 60",

to ten places, a page for the conversion of arc into time, and some constants.

In T. I. the change in the line is denoted by a bar placed over the fourth

figure of all the logarithms affected, the similar change when the third figure

ie decreased being denoted in the other tables by an asterisk; a final 5 in-

creased has a bar superscript. It is incorrectly stated in the preface that the

practice of marking all the last figures that have been increased was intro-

duced by ScHEON ; for this innovation was due to Babbage (see his preface,

p. x). Dr. Bruhns may, however, merely mean that the mark (viz. a bar sub-

script) introduced by Schron (1860) fatigues the eye and is of next to no

use                and                  if  so, we  entirely  agree  with  him.  In Babbage the increase is
                ;
                                                                                                                        .

                         ON MATHEMATICAL TABLES.                                                                           91

denoted by a point subscript, which the reader scarcely notices ; but in
Schron the bar catches the eye at once and is confusing. The cases also
in which it is necessary to know whether the last figure (unless a 5) has been
increased are excessively rare ; and in fact any one who wants such accuracy

should use a ten-figure table.

On the whole, this is one of the most convenient and complete (considering

the number of proportional-part tables) logarithmic tables for the general com-

puter that we have met with ; the figures have heads and tails ; and the pages
are light and clear. Purther, we believe it is published at a low price.

   Byrne, 1849 (Practical . . . method of calculating &c.). [T. I.] Primes

to 5000, pp. xiii and xiv.

   [T. II.] A very small table to convert degrees &c. into circular measure,

    Callet, 1853. [T. I.] Seven-figure logarithms to 1200, and from 10,200

to 108,000 (the last 8000 being to 8 places). Differences and proportional

parts are added ; but near the beginniug of the table, where the differences

change very rapidly, only the proportional parts of alternate differences are

given, through want of room on the page (this is also done by Babe age and

others). The constants S and T (see § 3, art. 13) for calculating the log

Ysines and tangents of angles less than 3°, as also the variation for 10",

are given in a line at the top of the page (see p. 113 of the Introduction).
To the left of each number in the number-column are placed not only the
degrees, minutes, &c. corresponding to that number of seconds, but also, in

another column, those corresponding to ten times that number. When the

--change of figure occurs in the middle of the block of figures the line is broken
   the best theoretical way of overcoming the difficulty. De Morgan and
others, however, have expressed a strong dislike to it ; and we agree with

them.

[T. II.] I. Common and hyperbolic logarithms of numbers from 1 to 1200

to 20 places, the former being on the left and the latter on the right-hand

pages. II. Common and hyperbolic logarithms of numbers from 101,000 to

101,179 to 20 places, with first, second, and third differences, the hyper-

bolic logarithms being on the right-hand pages. (Note. AU the common

logarithms from 101,143 to 101,179, with one exception, contain errors.)

III. Common and hyperbolic antilogarithms from -OOOOl to -00179 at

intervals of -00001, and from -000001 to -000179 at intervals of -000001,

respectively, to 20 places, with first, second, and third differences.

   [T. III.] I. Common logarithms (to 61 places) and hyperbolic logarithms

(to 48 places) of all numbers to 100, and of primes from 100 to 1097; and
(II.) from 999,980 to 1,000,021 : the hj'-perbolic logarithms occupy the right-
hand pages as before.

[T. IV.] The first hundred multiples to 24 places, and the first ten mul-

tiples  to  70  places,  of the  modulus  -434  .  .  .  and  its  reciprocal  2-302                                 .

9.2 REPORT-- 1873.

The order of the columns is sine, tangent, difference for sine, difference for

tangent, cosine ; but this arrangement only holds up to 5", when differences

Aare added for the cosine also.  change in the figiu-e at the toj) of the

column is denoted in the column by a line subscript under all the figures of

the firsf^^ logarithm affected, which arrests the eye at once.

[T. VII.J Natural and log sines (to 15 places) for every 10' (ten minutes

centesimal) of the quadrant. It is as well here to note that in the log sine

and cosine columns only nine figures are given, as the preceding figures are

olitainable from [T. VI. J ; two, however, are common to both : thus from
[T. VI.] we find log sin 10'=7-1961197, and in [T. VII.] we have given,

corresponding to log sin 10^ 969843372; so that log sin 10'=7-19611969

843372. It will therefore be noticed that the log sines are in strictness

given to 14 (and not 15) places. Further, it appears that the last figure

has not been, or at all events not been always, corrected; for log sin 50"=

-^ =log -34948500216800940...., and the logarithm in [T. VII.] ends

with the figures 6800. This is the only one we have examined.

At the end of [T. VII.] is given a page of tables to connect decimals of a

right angle with degrees, minutes, and seconds, ikc.

[T. VIII.] consists of proportional-part tables, and occupies 10 pp. : by

means of them any number less than 10,000 can be multiijlied by a single

Adigit with great ease ; the use of this in interpolation is evident.  full

explanation is given on pp. 32-36 of the Introduction to the work.
   [T. IX.] Log sines and tangents for every second of the first five degrees,

to seven places, without differences (sexagesimal).

[T. X.] Log sines and tangents for every ten seconds of the quadrant, to

seven places, with differences (sexagesimal).

  -- =[T. XL] Logistic logarithms, viz. log 3600" log x" from x 0" to
= =a- = 5280" 1° 28'; 3600" 1°.

The other tables have reference to Boi'da's method for the determination

of the longitude at sea.

On the whole, this is the most complete and practically useful collection

of logarithms for the general computer that has been published. In one not

very thick octavo volume, 11 important tables are given ; the type is very

clear and distinct, though rather small. In the logarithms of numbers an

attempt has been made to give rather too much on the page ; but for general

usefulness this collection of tables is almost unique.

The introduction, of 118 pp., is the worst portion of the work ; it is badlj'

arranged, confused, and, worst of all, has no index ; so that it is very hard to

find the explanation of any table required, if it is explained at all. On

p. 112 the value of e is given; but the figures after the 8th group of five

are erroneous, and should be 47093 69995 95749 66967 6             (see Erit.

Assoc. Report, 1871, Transactions of Sections, p. 16).

   On pp. 12 and 13 of the introduction are two tables that deserve notice

the first gives the square, 4th, IGth .... 2''°th roots of 10 to about 28 significant

figures (leaving out of consideration the ciphers that follow the 1 in the

higher powers). The second gives powers of '5 as far as the 60th.

With regard to errors, an important list is given by Lefort in the ' Comptes

Uendus,' vol. xliv. p. 1100 (1857) ; and these of course apply to the later
iirages. Manj^ errors of importance, as also some information as to the
sources whence CaUet derived his tables, are given. See also Gauss in Zach's

' Monatliche Correspondonz,' November 1802 (or 'Werke,' t. iii. p. 241), for
four errata, and Gernerth's paper (referred to at the end of the introductory
                                                   ON MATHJiMATIOAL TABLES.                                                                                                        93

remarks in §3, art. 13), and also Hutxon's tables (editions 1783-1822),

Gernerth remarks (p. 25) that errors pointed out by Hutton in 1822 still re-

Wemained uncorrected in the tirage of 1846.                                                                                                                                        may also refer to a paper by

Herrmann, entitled " Verbesserung der II. Callet'schen Tafel der gemeinen

Logarithmen mit 20 Decimalen, nebst Vorschliigen fiir die weitere Porde-

rung dieses Zweckes," printed in the ' Sitzungsberichte der Kaiserlichen

Akademie der Wissensdhaftcn,' Vienna, 1848, part ii. pp. 175-190.
   On p. liii of their work, Hobert and Ideler (1799) remark that they

found that in general the natural sines of Callet were calculated accurately,

but that in the log sines the last two figures were generally doubtful ; they

mention also that they found many other faults in the work, but, being un-
certain how far these are corrected in the stereotype edition, they only give

one : viz., on p. 117 of the introduction, in the eighth place in the value of f

Athere is a 2 for a 3 ; and this fault renders erroneous the multiples of /.

list of 380 errors is given on pp. 348 and 349 of the book, in all of which

+the error is 1 in the last place, and also an error in a natural sine is given.

The above error in /is corrected in the tirage of 1853.

On p. 120 of EoRDA and Delambre there are given six eiTors in the ste-

Areotyped tables of Callet.                                  good many errors are also given at the end of

Vega's Manual (1800).

Many other  errata                                 are noted in other books                                                                                                        but it seems useless to give
                                                                                                                                                                                ;

references without at the same time examining whether the errors have been

subsequently corrected, and, if so, in what tirages.

Hobert and Ideler consider that Callet obtained his log sines most pro-

bably by interpolation from the ' Trigonometria Artificialis ' of Vlacq.

   The number of tirages of this work has been very great : it was first
published in 1783, we believe; but the type from which the earlier tirages

were printed was subsequently reset, as the size of the page in the editions

published in this century is larger than that of the first, which had tlierefore

more right to the title " Tables portatives." The tirage we have described
above is that of 1853 ; and we have seen one of 1862, " revue par J. Dupuis "
(Dupuis was himself subsequently the editor of a set of logarithmic tables,

described in this section). There is also a stiU more recent edition, edited

Weby M. ISaigey.                          have an impression that the Callet of 1793 was the first

logarithmic table stereotyped ; but we have not investigated the matter.

first page (extending to 10') the logarithms are not given completely, the
last figure, two figures, or three figures being printed as ciphers. This
is done, we presume, because in the cases to M'hich the table is intended to
be applied accuracy in these places is not required. The same is done in

several other copies of this table occurring in other nautical collections.

places.

   The tables are beautifully printed, and are practically free from error.
Prof. Wackerbarth states ('Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical
Society,' April 1867) that he finds the only error in the work to be among
the constants on p. 213, line 5, where 2-718281829 should be 2-718281828,

the following figure being 4.

   There is no name on the titlepage ; but it is well known that the tables

were prepared by De Morgan, and they are always spoken of by his name.

the remarks on T. XIX. (p. xiv), the versed sine of x is erroneously defined

--as if it were 1 sin .r.

  Dunn, 1784. [T. I.] Six -figure logarithms to 10,000. The arrangement

0, 1, 2, . . . . 9 running along the top line, they are printed 0-00, 100, 2-00, ....

9-00, which gives the table the appearance of being arranged differently.

[T. II.] Log sines, tangents, and secants to every minute of the quadrant,

to 6 places. At the foot of each page is a small table, giving the differences

(for the sine and tangent) for an interval of 60" in the middle of the page,

and their proportional parts for 50", 40", 30", 20", 10", 9", 8", 7", 6", 5", 4",

figure is an improvement on the simple multiples given in Sang, 1871, and

others, as the table can be more readil}'- used by those accustomed only to

proportional parts true to the nearest unit.) S and T (§ 3, art. 13) arc given

at the bottom of the pages at intervals of 10". Dupuis states in the preface

that his intention had been that the table should extend to 120,000, and

that accordingly he had calculated the last 12,000 logarithms by differences,

but at the request of a number of professors he stopped at 100,000. "\Vc

venture to think he would have acted more wisely if he had not listened to

the professors*; but the matter is of no consequence now, as Sang, 1871,

extends to 200,000,

* Several of tbe ordinary seven-figure tables (Babbage, Callet, Hulsse's Vega, and

many otliers) extend to 108,000, and the last 8U00 logarithms are given to eight places.

seconds of time in 1", 2", .... 60", to 7 places ; then foUows an explanation

of the use of the tables.

   This is the only work we can call to mind in which negative characteristics

--(with the sign printed over the figure) are given throughout ; and to the

mathematical computer such are preferable to the ordinary characteristics

inei-eased by 10. Also the edges of the pages of T. VI.-VIII. are red (the

rest being grey), which facilitates the use of the tables. It is curious that

it never should have occurred to any editor or publisher of a collection of tables
to colour the edges of the pages of the separate tables difi"erently, and print

thereon also their titles, as is done with the different businesses &c. in the

Loudon Post-OfRce Directory.

Dupuis was also the editor of the 1862 edition of Callet ; and the titles of

several small tables of logarithms that we have not seen are advertised in

--this work, viz, : (1) an edition of Lalande's five-figure tables, with Gaussian
                                                                                            (2) an 18mo book of four-figure tables ; and (3)
logarithms added, &c.
                                                                                         ;

logarithmic and antilogarithmic tables to 4 places, for the use of physicists,

giving log (1 -f at) for the calculation of dilatations &c.

   [Encke, 1828.] [T. I.] Four-figure logarithms to 100 (with characteris-

tics and differences), and from 100 to 1009.

   [T. II.] Log sines, tangents, cotangents, and cosines for every 4' from
0° to 10°, and thence to 45° at intervals of 10', to 4 places, with dif-

ferences.

   [T. III.] Gaussian logarithms ; B and C are to 4 places, for argument
A, from A=-00 to 1-80 at intervals of -01, and thence to 4-0 at intervals of -1,

with differences.

   Encke's name is written on the Royal Society's copy of these tables ; and
they are also spoken of as Encke's by De Morgan. They are reprinted in
'WAENSTOEFi-'s ScHUMACHEE, 1845 (§ 4).

   Everett [1866]. Two cards (one of which, unfolded, is equal in size to three

folio pages, the other, which is equal in size to one, being perforated), in a cover.

This very frequently gives rise to errors, as the computer who is accustomed to tlu-ee
leading figures common to the block of figures is liable to fail to notice that in this part

of the table there are four ; and on this account a figure (the fourth) is sometimes

omitted in taking out the logarithm. It is therefore often desirable to ignore the con-

tinuation of the table and only use the portion below 100,000. The extra logarithms

are thus not always an advantage ; and it is on the face of it inconvenient that some of the

tabular results should be given to 7 and others to 8 places. When tables of logarithms
are placed in the hands of common computers, it is as a rule better to forbid the use of
the portion beyond 100,000 ; and it may have been some considerations of this nature

that induced M. Dupuis to take this number as his limit. But there is no objection that
we can see against giving the logarithms beyond 100,000 to 7 places (as in Sano, 1871)
aad whenever this is done, the continuation is found very useful.

These cards correspond to the fixed and movable portions of a slide-rule

A100 inches long.  few small tables of cube roots, sines, &c. are printed on

one of the cards. Prof. Everett (to whom we applied for information with re-

--gard to the date of the table) gives the following brief description " Two

cards, one of them cut like a grating, equivalent to the two pieces of a slide-

rule;" and adds "that in the first edition [which is the one we have

described] one of the cards had a pair of folding leaves attached to it,

but these merely contained subsidiary tables and directions, and were quite
unessential. In the next impression the two essential cards and the two

cards with subsidiary tables and directions were all detached from each

Aother."  description of the table is given in the Phil. Mag. for November

18G6.

Parley, 1840. [T. I.] Six-figure logarithms to 10,000 (the line is

broken when the change occurs in the third figure) ; followed by the loga-
rithms of numbers from 1001 to 1200, to 7 places.

[T. II.] Log sines and tangents for every minute of the quadrant, to 6

places, with difi^erences for 100".
   [T. III.] Log sines from 0° to 2° at intervals of 6".

   There are also a few constants and some formulae.

  --Parley, 1856. This very fine table of versed sines contains : [T. I.]

Natural versed sines from 0° to 125° at intervals of 10", to 7 places, with

proportional parts throughout.

   [T. II.] Log versed sines from 0° to 135° at intervals of 15", to 7 places,
with difi"erences throughout. The arguments are also given in time, the

range being from 0*" to 9^ to every second.

  A short preface by Mr. Hind states that the table was prepared by Mr.

Farley, of the Nautical- Almanac Office, in 1831, and the manuscript pre-
sented by him to Lieut. Stratford, the then superintendent. The manuscript

having been in use for 25 years, and having become dilapidated, it was

*' deemed the most economical course to print it." It is added that the last

figure cannot be relied on, though it is probably very rarely in error by more

than a unit.

   These, the most complete tables of versed sines we have seen, are beauti-

fully printed, in the same type as the Nautical Almanac.

   Faulliaber, 1G30 (' Ingeuieurs-Schul '). The copy we have seen of this
book (viz. that in the British Museum) contains no logarithms, though it must

evidently have been intended to accompany some tables. In the Brit- Mug.

copy the work is bound up (in a volume containing four tracts) after the two
described below and attributed by us to Faulhaber. Murhard gives the
full titles of this work and of the next two, and marks them as having come

under his eye ; he does not, however, assign the two tables to Faulhaber.

Hogg, who also gives the titles of the three works, attributes them all to Faul-
haber. He adds, speaking of the tables, that they are also contained in the

' Ingenicurs-SchuL' This is no doubt correct; for, as noted below, some errors

in the latter work are given at the end of the Canon. It seems therefore
certain that Faulhaber was the editor of the tables. It may be mentioned
that both Eogg and Murhard agree in describing the ' Logarithmi ' and the
' Canon ' as parts of the same work, so that most likely they were never issued
separately. Hogg gives the date of the ' Ingenieurs-Schur as 1731, which

must be "a misprint for 1631; the copy before us is dated 1630, agree-

ing with Murhard. A lengthy account of Faulhaber and his works wiU

be found in Kiistner's ' Geschichte.' Sec also Schcibel, ' Math. Biicherk.' B. 2.

from 1 to 10,000, arranged in columns (three to the page), with charac-
teristics, xis there arc 3 coUimns, there are 99 logarithms on each page. The
printing is imperfect, the types having here and there become displaced,
so as to leave no mark. There are some errata on the last page, headed
" Typographus Lectori S." See above, Faulhaber, 1630 (' lugenieurs-

   [Faulhaber] 1631 ('Canon'). Logarithmic sines, tangents, and secants
for every minute of the quadrant, to 10 places (semiquadrantally arranged);
no differences. Taken from Vlacq, 1628. The table is followed by 8 pages of
errata in the Frankfort 'lugenieurs-Schul,' in the logarithms of numbers, and in
the ' Canon.' Except perhaps Norwood, ] 631, this is the first reprint of
Vlacq's corrected ' Canon ' (1628), the previous writers haviug copied
GuNTER (1620). Rogg gives place and date as Nuremberg, 1637 ; but
the copy before us is not so. See above, Faulhaber, 1630 (' Ingenieurs-

Schul').

   Filipowski, 1849. T. I. Antilogarithms. The numbers (to 7 figures)

are given answering to the logarithms as arguments, the range being frona
·00000 to 1-00000 at intervals of -00001. The arrangement is exactly the
same as in ordinary seven-figure tables of logarithms ; and the table occupies
201 pages. The proportional parts are given to hundredths (viz. 100 pro-
portional parts of each difference are given); and the change of figure in tho

middle of the line is denoted by two dots (thus, 0) placed over the fourth
figure of all numbers affected ; and when a final 5 has been increased it is

printed Y. The first 3 figures in the number arc alwaj-s separated by a

\=of the book) we have A given to 3 places for argument \ from
                                                                -00000 to

=A·00449 (which last corresponds to  8-017), at intervals of -00001. On

the succeeding 16 pages we have ,\ as a tabular result for argument A from

A= 8-000 to 13-999, at intervals of -001, to 5 places.

Since  +log (a 6) =log b-\- log | ,- -|- 1 j, and

       log {a--b)=log 6-1- log (J-i),

it is clear that the rules are very simple and uniform, viz. log a and log b

being given (6 < « suppose), we take --log « log 6 as argument, and enter

--the table at the A or \ column, according as we want log a-\-b or log a b,

and add the tabular result to log b. In this table also the notations 0,

V, &c. are used, as well as another in which a wavy line runs down by the

side of the logarithms whose leading figures have changed. This method of

marking is only possible when the tabular results appear one under the other.

The figures are throughout neat and clear, having heads and tails ; and the

copy before us is printed on green paper^ of a pleasant colour. In many

places there is a parsimony of figures, which we dislike extremely ; thus there

errors affecting the first 8 figures of Dodson"s Canon (1742) is given, and in-

in addition to those corrected v.ith tlie author's own hand." These words im-

ply that Mr. Filipowski's table was the result of an independent calculation ; or
at all events they ought not to have been written unless such had been the case.
It is, however, nowhere stated in the preface that the table was calculated
anew ; and we may therefore assume that it was copied from Dodwn, after
examination (which would not have been difficult, as a mere verification by

differences would have sufficed). In a letter by Mr. Peter Gray, in the
' Insurance Record ' for Juue 9, 1871, there are given two errors in Dodson
which also occur in Filipowski, affording additional evidence that the tables of
the latter were not calculated independently ; and, this being so, Dodson
has not been treated fairly, as Mr. Pilipowski should have acknowledged the
obligations he was under to his table. In the same letter Mr. Gray
gives three other errors in FUipowski (1st edit.) ; and it is to be in-
ferred from other passages in the letter that a second and a third edition,

--*' corrected," have been published. Mr. Gray proceeds : " but he [Fili-

powski] has never, so far as I know, given a list of the errors contained in the
first and second, and corrected in the third," an omission on which he strongly
(and most justly) animadverts. See Shortrede (1849).

   De Morgan has stated that no antilogarithmic table was published from
Dodson (1742) till 1849 ; but this is only true if Shortrede's tables of 1844

be ignored ; for which there is no sufficient reason, as thej' were published
and sold in that year, and copies of the 1844 edition are contained in all good

libraries.

  A list of errata is given in the Prench reprint described below ; and 69

errors are pointed out by Hution on p. 342 of the edition of 1794 (and

no doubt in other editions) of his mathematical tables. The list given in the

edition of 1822 (the last published in Hutton'e lifetime) is much fuller. De
Morgan speaks of Gardiner as "rare, and much esteemed for accuracy;" and

its rarity in 1770 is the reason assigned by the French editors for the neces-

isity of reprinting it.

   Gardiner (Avignon Eepriut, 1770). The reprint is so similar to the ori-

ginal edition that it is only necessary to point out the differences.

   [T. I.] is the same ; but in [T. II.] the log sines are given at intervals of
1" as far as 4°, and a similar table of log tangents is added ; they were taken
from a manuscript calculated by ilouton, bequeathed by him to the Academy

of Sciences, and lent to the editors by Lalande. Also in the original edition,

in the second portion of this table, viz. that giving the functions at intervals

of 10", the parts common to both are repeated ; but this is not done in the

reprint, in which therefore there is a table of log cosines and cotangents only,
from 0° to 4°, at intervals of 10", the sines and tangents being given in the

previous portion.

    [T. III., v., and VI.] are unaltered ; but [T. IV.] proceeds by odd numbers
to 1161. One fresh table is added, viz. [T. VII.], giving hyperbolic loga-

rithms from 1-00 to 10-00 at intervals of -01, to 7places, and also log^ 10", . . . 10'.
Mouton's manuscript also gave log cotangents and cosines to every second

of the first four degrees ; but the former are so easUy deducible from the tan-

(1628), in Gardiner (1742), and in the French reprint itself (1770), the last

having been published in the ' Connaissance des Temps ' for 1775. As the

' Connaissance des Temps' could not have been published as much as five

years in advance, it is clear either that some copies of the French reprint were

published subsequently to 1770, although retaining that date on the titlcpage,

or that this page was circulated separately and bound up afterwards with the

says that this edition was edited by Pere Pczenas, Pcre Dumas, and Pero

Elauchard, and adds that ho has given an errata-list in the ' Connaissanco

des Temps ' for 1775. On Dumas, mathematician of Lyons, who was La-

lande's first master, he gives a reference to the ' Journal des Savants,' No-

vember 1770.

  Tlie edition is very commonly known by the name of Pezonas. A good

deal about Pezenas will be found in Delambre's ' Histoire de I'Astronomic,'

pp. 368-386. He was born at Avignon in 1692, and died in 1770.

The French edition is even better printed than the original, but is not

Aquite so accurate.    list of 85 errors is given by Hutton on p. 343 of his

mathematical tables in the edition of 1794, while he discovered only 69

in the original edition; more complete lists are to be found in the later

editions.

   Graesso (' Tresor') says that there was a reprint of Gardiner in octavo at
Florence by Canovai and Ricco.

of Gardiner, viz. 'Tables des Logarithmes de Gardiner, foL, Par. Chez Sail-

lard et Nyon, 1773,' which he takes from the * Journal litterairo do Berlin,'
t. vii. p. 318 ; but the fact that Lalande does not mention it seems to him

very suspicious : we have seen no other reference to it, and agree with Hogg.

versed sines are the arguments ; and the table proceeds from '001 to -500 (of

=the diameter). The table may therefore be described as giving ^(2^-- sin 2d)

from ^(1-- cos 0) -001 to -500 at intervals of -001.

  A few constants are then given to a great many places ; and the last page

(T. XIV.) is for the calculation of logarithms to 20 places.

   Hartig, 1829. The tables are of so commercial a kind that only one or
two deserve notice here.

   The first (T. I.) is for computing the contents of planks &c., the thickness and

breadth being given in Zolle and the length in Fusse, and may be described

as a sort of duodecimal table, as the Kubik-ZoU =; J^ Kubik-Fuss, and the

=Kubik-Linie J^ Kubik-ZoU. Thus for arguments 3 Zoll, 13 ZoU, and

+5Fusswehave 1 F. 4 Z. 3 L. as result; ioT j\x\-lx5=\^^=l +-Jj j^^.

--The arguments are : (thickness) 1 ZoU to 9 Zoll at intervals of i Zoll

(breadth) 1 Zoll to 18 Zoll at intervals of 1 Zoll; (length) 1 Fuss to 60
Fuss at intervals of 1 Fuss.

   Another table (T. II.) is of the same kind, only intended for blocks &c.
BO that the thickness is greater, and the result is only given in fractions of
a Kubik-Fuss.

    T. III. contains volumes of cylinders for diameter (or circumference) of
seciion and length as arguments ; expressed as in T. I. and II. The money-

=tables can have no mathematical value, as the Thaler 30, 24, or 90

Groschen, &c.

   T. X. is for the calculation of interest. The simple-interest tables (T. A)

are too meagre to be worth description. T. B and C may be described as
giving the compound interest and present value of £1 for any number of

years up to 100 at 3, 4, 5, and 6 per cent, per annum, viz.

mj(i +  -* (i + m)'

to 6 decimal places.

   Other tables of this kind that we met with have not been noticed ; the

title of one such is given under Jahn, 1837.

   Copies of this book were published with Latin, English, French, German,
and Spanish introductions and titlepages (the titles will be found in the list
at the end of the Eeport). The tables are the same in all ; and the special
titlepages for each table have the headings in the five languages. The
Eoyal Society's library contains the Latin copy perfect, and the introduc-
tions in the four modern languages boimd together in another volume, pre-
sented to the Society by the author. At the end of the latter volume is
pasted-in a specimen page of the table, set up with the usual even figures
--106 REPORT 1873.

and the author has written on the back, " This sheet proves that, with
the usual form of figures of the same size as those used in the tables, they
woidd not have been distinctly legible." The figures actually used are very
thin, and have large heads and tails, resembling somewhat figures made in
writing ; and a comparison of the specimen and a page of tho tables shows
very clearly the superiority of the latter in point of distinctness. The words

in minima forma are quite justified, as we do not think it would be possible
to make the tables occupy less room without serious loss of clearness. All

that is usually given in a page of seven-figure logarithms is here contained
in a space about 3 in. by 5 in. ; and yet, owing to tho shape of the figures,
every thing is very distinct. The author says on the titlepage, " purcjaUe
ah erroribus prceccdeniium tabulariim ;" but the last figure of log 52943
is ])rinted 6 instead of 5. There is also another last-figure error. Sec

to read than in most modern tables.

of the calculations, viz. 381 errors in the trigonometrical tables of Callet, all
of which, with one exception, affect only the last figure by a unit, and 138

similar errors in Vega's ' Thesaurus,' 1794, The errors in CaUet have, we

presume, been corrected in the later tirages.

sures and weights of different countries, &c. The table of 12-place square

roots was published' here for the first time : it was calculated by Hensel in

1804. The seven-place cube roots, the chord-table, and the new columns of

the Gaussian table were calculated by Dr. Michaelis, of Leipzig. The author

draws attention to the fact that the last figures in T. VIII. and XII. are given

correctly.

   It is a matter of sufficient interestto note here that, though the work is called
an edition of Vega, it contains one error from which the other tables known by
the name of Vega and published subsequently to his folio of 1794 were free.
In Vlacq (1628), log 52943 was printed 7238085868 instead of 7238085468,
and the error was first pointed out and corrected by Vega in his folio of 1794.
All the seven-figure tables, therefore, from 1628 to 1794 (and several of the
subsequent tables also), have 7238086 instead of 7238085 ; but Vega's smaU
editions (the ' Manuale ' and ' Tabuloe ') have the logarithms correctly printed.
In Hulsse's edition, however, the error is reproduced afresh, and the last figure

is printed 6. It follows therefore either that Hiilsse did not reprint Vega's

table, or that, if he did, he noticed the discrepancy, and decided in favour of
tlie erroneous value. The slight suspicion thus cast on these tables is unfor-
                         ON MATHEMATICAL TABLES,                                  109

WcCallex.     have seen advertised a second edition (1849) ; and Zkch's tables

(see Zech, 1849, § 3, art. 19) are extracted from it. The last-figure error

noticed above is the only one of the hereditary Vlacq's errors that appears

in the table of tlie logarithms of numbers ; so that but for this curious

blunder the present work would have been, we believe, the first to

be free from errors of this class (see ' Monthly Notices of the Roy. Ast.

Soc' March, 1873). Some remarks by Gauss on T. XII. appear in t. iii.

Philosophical Transactions, 1870, p. 370.

   The remaining three pages of the book are devoted to weights and mea-

sures &c. The table is closely printed; and some of the pages contain a great
many figures, as there are a hundred lines to the page. De Morgan states
that the table has not the reputation of correctness ; and the charge is no
doubt true, as, besides the two errors noted above (both of which we found
on the only page we have used), it is to be inferred from Barlow's intro-
duction to his tables that he found errors ; he did not, however, publish any

account of them.

110 REPORT~1873.

   Some constants are given in T. XX. ; the other tables consist of a traverse

table, formulae, &c.

    The edition described above is one of those edited by Olintlius Gregory,
and is the last we have met with. The first edition was published in 1785,
the second in 1794, the third in 1801, the fifth in 1811, and the sixth, the

last published in Hutton's lifetime (he died 1823), in 1822.

   We have compared the first, second, and sixth editions, and that of 1858

described above. The first two are nearly identical, so that we need only

notice the diff'erences between the tables of 1785^ 1822, and 1858. In both
the two former of these editions T. I. only extends to 100,000 ; and while in
that of 1785 the change of figure in the line is not marked at all, in that of
1822 the fourth figure in the first logarithm aflfected only is marked. T. II. is
the same in the 1822 edition, but it ends at 1161 instead of 1199 in that of
1785. T. III. in 1785 ended at 101,139, and is extended to 101,149 in both
the other editions, as also did T. IV. originally end at '00139. In the edi-
tions of 1785 and 1822 occur two tables that were left out by Gregory in
1830 and in succeeding editions, viz. T. 5, giving logarithms of all numbers
to 100, and of primes from 100 to 1100, to 61 places, and T. 6, giving the
logarithms of the numbers from 999,980 to 1,000,020, to 61 places, with first,
second, third, and fourth differences. T. VI., of hyperbolic logarithms, ap-
pears in the edition of 1822, but not in that of 1785. T. VII. extended only
to 80' in 1785.

   To all the first six editions is prefixed Hutton's introduction, containing a
history of logarithms, the difi"erent ways in which they may be constructed,
&:c. This very valuable essay was omitted by Gregory in the seventh (1830)
and subsequent editions (on account of its being rather out of place in a col-
lection of tables), and with some reason. In the 1785 edition it occupied
180 pp., 55 pp. of which are the " Description and Use of the Tables." This
portion Gi'egory retained ; and in the 1858 edition it occupied 68 pp.

   The whole work was reset in the later editions, published in Hutton's
lifetime, the chief additions, as we infer from the preface, having been made
in the fifth (1811) edition. On the last page of the 1822 edition are some
errata found in Callet (1783, 1795, and 1801), and also in Taylor (1792);
the lists of errors in GARDrNER (London and Avignon) are also more complete
than in the earlier editions. Hutton's tables were the legitimate successors
of Sheewin's, and bring down to the present time one of the main lines of
descent from Vlacq (see Sherwin, § 4).

   [T. IX.] Natural versed sines to every minute (of arc) to 180°, to 6 places,

tables are nautical.

   The paging of the book runs at the top of the pages to 216, and thence at
the bottom to 275 ; it then recommences at the top at p. 217. This is no
doubt caused by [T. Y., YI.] having been introduced in this edition only.

    \Ye have seen the original work, ' Nautical Tables designed for the use of
British Seamen, by James Inman, D.D. London, 1830' (400 pp. of tables),
but have not compared the two together : except for the " haversines," how-
ever, the tables seem to be nearly identical in the two editions.

contains no tables.

Fuss, &c.) are so special that they do not appear to possess any mathema-

tical value.

   John, 1837. Vol. I. Six-figure logarithms to 100,000 ; the change in
the hne is denoted by a dagger (f) prefixed to the fourth figure of all loga-

rithms affected. There are no proportional parts on the page ; but they are
given in a separate table at the end.

    Vol. II. Logarithmic sines and tangents for every second of the first
degree ; log sines and tangents for every third second of the quadrant (semi-
quadrautally arranged) : aU to 6 places. Proportional parts are given in the
extreme right and left columns of the double page for every twentieth of the

three-second interval.

   The introductory matter is both in German and Latin.

  We rather like the paper on which the second volume is printed ; though

not of a good quality, it is thick and stiff, and of a brownish colour, so that

the book could be, we think, used for a long time at once without injury to

the eye : the first volume (in the copy before us) , however, is printed on

paper of the soft, flaccid kind common in German books.
   The author was led to publish his tables by observing that nearly all those

in use were either five- or seven-figure tables.

  We have seen, by the same author, 'Tafehi zur Berechnnng fiir Kubik-

Inhalt (Src.,' 2nd edit., Leipzig, 18-17; but the tables are commercial (argu-
ments expressed in ZoUe, Ellen, &c.), and do not need notice here.

   Kerigan, 1821. T. YIII. Log sines for every second to 2°, and thence,

xi pp., giving a description of his (Felkel's) tables of divisors &c. ; and there
is also added at the end an account of his proposed scheme of tables in rela-

tion to the theory of numbers. About Felkel, see Felkel, 1776, § 3, art. 8.
   The titlepage states that this is a translation from a German edition. The

original was entitled ' Zusatze zu den logarithmischen tind trigonometrischcn
Tabellen," and was published in 1770 ; or, at all events, De Morgan's descrip-

tion of the contents of this latter work, which we have not seen, agrees,
as far as it goes, almost entirely with the ' Supplementa ' &c., which De Morgan
had heard of, but not seen. The introduction to the latter shows signs of

having been amplified by Felkel.

we seek 15150 at the head of the column, and line 34 in the column : this

ON MATHEMATICAL TABLES.                   117

   The copy of this tract before us (which is bouiul up in a volume with
several otlicrs, and belongs to the Cambriclge University Library) is clearly
either a separate reprint or merely a table torn out from some larger
work. The paging runs from 262 to 351 : at the beginning there is a plate,
the size of the page, of a, person observing with a sextant, and the words
" between page 248 and 249 " below in the left hand-corner, and at the end
a diagram with a movable circle and pointer, headed " The fore part of the
Nocturnall or side held next the face in time of obser\'ation," and " between

page 254 and 255 " below. On examination we find the table is [T. IV.] of

Sir Jonas Mooee's ' Systeme of the Mathematicks,' 1681, just described.

The engravings do not, however, appear to be taken from cither volume
of this work. It is very likely that this table was merely torn out
from the work, and was never published separately ; still as, according to
De Morgan, this is the first appearance of such a table in England, it is not
improbable that copies may have been in request, and therefore issued

separately.

John Newton, 1658. [T. I.] Logarithms to 1000, to 8 places, and

Alogarithms from 10,000 to 100,000, also to 8 places.                                  column is added to

each page containing the logarithms of the differences, to 5 places.

[T. II.] Log sines and tangents (semiquadrantaUy arranged) for every

centesimal minute (viz. nine-thousandth part of a^-ight angle), to 8 places,

with differences.

[T. III.] Log sines and tangents for the first three degrees of the quadrant,

to 5 places, the interval being the one thousandth part of a degree. Loga-

rithms of the differences to 8 places are added.

The trigonometrical tables are thus of the kind introduced by Briggs, and

are partly centesimal (see § 3, art. 15, p. 64). This is the only extensive

eight-figure table that has been published ; and it is also remarkable on

account of the logarithms of the differences, instead of the differences, being

given. It seems worth consideration whether, in the event of a republication

of Vlacq, 1628, it would not be advantageous to replace the differences by

their logarithms. It is usually most convenient, if many logarithms are to

be taken out at one time, to interpolate for the last five figures in a ten-

figure table by means of an ordinary seven-figure table ; but in other cases

recourse is generally had to simple division, and the natural differences are

best. The table would occupy too much space if both the diflerences and

their logarithms were added ; and there is not much chance of two publi-

cations ever being made, one with natural, and the other with logarithmic,

differences. If the choice had to be made, the decision would probably be in

favour of the simple differences as they are, though a good deal might be

urged on the other side.

A few errata are given at the end of the address to the reader, and a great

many  more    on   the  last  page                             the  tables,  however,  reproduce  nearly  all

Viacq's errors, which affect the first 8 places (see ' Monthly IS'otices of the

Boy. Ast. Soc' March 1873), This was the first table in which the arrange-
ment, now universal in seven-figure tables (viz. with the fifth figures run-

ning horizontally along the top line of the page), was used. The change of

the third figure in the line is not noted.

The title of this work being the ' Trigonometria Britannica ' (printed

* Britanica ' on the titlepage), it is often confounded with Beiggs's work of

this name, Gouda, 1633 (§ 3, art. 15), from which it is derived. Also, as
GeUibrand's name appears on the titlepage it is sometimes attributed to
him in catalogues.

In the Cambridge Univei-sity Library is a copy of this book, in which the

titlepage and introduction are absent, "the first page being the titlepage to

the tables, so that the work is anonymous. Whether some copies of the tables

alone were published, or Avhether the copy in question is imperfect, we do not

know.

seen are : ^first, 1631 ; second, 1641 ; thiixl, 1656 ; seventh, 1678.

   This was one of the first small tables in which the trigonometrical canon

was derived from Vl.vcq, 1628, and not Guntee, 1620.

by a ' Tabula differentiarum ' for the sines and tangents.

In an appendix at the end of the book it is explained that the logarithmic

sines and tangents were intended by the author to consist of seven figures
after the index, but that " the seventh figure was unhappily left out." This

is also referred to in the dedication.

Vlacq's, though his name is not mentioned, and takes occasion very truly to
remark how many authors have considered that the merit of their books con-

sisted in the trigonometry, and that the tables (which usually form by far the

greater part of the work) were accessories of which no notice need be taken.

   Parkhurst, 1871. This little book contains forty-two tables, with the

Most of these tables are tabulated for their use in the calculation of

logarithms by well-knoAvn methods. The arrangement of the work is most

confused                                                and  it  would  be  very  difficult  to  understand  from    the  author's

description the objects of his tables. The paging of the book runs from 1

to 176; and this portion includes all the tables. Then Part 2 commences,

and the pages are numbered afresh from 1 to 38. In Part 3 the pages pro-

ceed from 1 to 27. Parts 2 and 3 are occupied with a description of the

tables                            and the reader who wishes to luidcrstand                       the  meaning of         the nota-

tion (which is often needlessly complex and confusing, to save the space of

a few figures), &c.. is recommended to begin at Part 3, p. 5. It would take too
much room, even if it were worth Avhile, to explain the tables in detail ; but it
may be stated that the tables (for the constructiou of logarithms of factors) give

                                                                 '"^              (l --'"' I

mthe is loft out, -where it is thought the context prcveuts risk of mistake

--and instead of n o jn there is sometimes written n om, and the lieading

" cologarithm." The^Last page of the hook, headed (wrongly) Tahlc XXXIII.,

contains a very imperfect list of the abbreviations used.

   It is to be inferred from the Preface &c., that the book was set up and
electrotyped by the author himself, Avho states that " it is probable that there
is not now a single error in the whole table." The reward of a copj' of the book
is also offered to the first finder of any important error under certain condi-

tions. Parts of the book, in the cojiy before us, are very badly printed, so
badly in fact that one or two images are wholly illegible ; and the tables are so

crowded that we should think no one would use them who could procure any
others that could be made to do as well. In fact the author's object seems to
have been to crowd the greatest possible amount of tabular matter into the
smallest space, without any regard to clearness. It is stated in the work that

in the course of the printing, incomplete copies (some containing proofs almost
illegible) were distributed to the author's friends ; and an advertisement on the

cover states that copies containing proofs rejected in the printing may be had

at different prices according to their completeness and the order of the tables.
The book is printed phonetically ; and this adds to the awkwardness of the

most confused, ba3ly printed, and ill-explained series of tables we have met
with in the preparation of this Report. By issuing his tables in the form
and manner he has adopted, the author has not done justice to himself, as
several are the results of original calculation and are not to be met with

elscAvhere.

Pasquich, 1817. T. I. Five-figure logarithms to 10,000 (arranged

consecutively in columns), without diff'erences.

   T. II. Log sines, cosines, tangents, and cotangents, from 0' to 56' at in-
tervals of 10", thence to 1° at intervals of 20", and thence to 45° at intervals

of l',.witli difterences for 1". Also squares of natural sines, cosines, tangents,

and cotangents from 1° to 45° at intervals of 1', all to 5 places. De Morgan

says, "This trigonometrical canon in squares is, we suppose, almost unique."

T. III. Gaussian logarithms. B and C (same notation as in Gauss), to 5

A Aintervals of -001, from = 2-00 to = 3-40 at intervals of -01, and from

A A= 3-4 to = 5 at intervals of ·!. This table is the same as that originally

given by Gauss, 1812 (§ 3, art. 19).

  A iv\Y constants &c. are added in an Appendix.
  A lengthy review of this Avork by Gauss appeared in the ' Gottiugische

t. iii. of his ' Werke.'

   Pearson, 1824. Yol. I. contains 296 large quarto pages of tables ; but

--only three pages come within the range of this lieport, viz.: [T. I.], p. 109,

w^hich expresses 1°, 2°, 3°   360°, and 1', 2'    60' as decimals of the cir-

cumference of the circle to 4 and 5 places respectively ; and [T. III.], p. 262,
which gives the circular measure of 1°, 2°. . . .180°, of 1', 2'. . . .60' and of

a change of sign is produced in the second. It is thus sufficient to tabulate

them only from to -50, and to write the arguments down the column from 0-00

to -SO, and ujiwards from -50 to 1*00, attending to the sign of the second func-

tion ; and this is accordingly the arrangement in the table. Tabic II. (pp. 1 04,

Rios, 1809. The first edition was published in 1806; and this is the

second. The tables are identical with those in the Spanish reprint of 1850

described below, so that the description of the latter will suffice. The

numbers both of the tables and the pages are the same in both ; and the only

difference is that the headings of the tables &c. in the 1809 edition are in

AEnglish.                  list of errors in this edition is given in the reprint of 1850. '"       ._

thought it would bo more convenient to give the work the date of 1809, as

this more properly represents the time of appearance than does 1850.

   T. XIV. Proportional logarithms for every second to 3", to 5 places.
This table only differs from T. 74 of Eapek in there being 5 instead of

4 places given.

versed, suversed, and sucoversed from 0° to 45° at intervals of 15" (with

arguments also in time), to 5 places. The term " versed " (versos) is used

for semiversed sine for brevity, and so for the others ; the table thus gives

i +log 2 (1                           sin x). The log sines, cosines, &c. are on

the left-hand pages, and the log versed &c. on the right-hand pages. The

table, altered in arrangement so as to make it quadrautal, is reproduced in

Stansbukt, 1822. There are also given some small tables to convert arc

into time, and vice versa, on p. 472.

   These tables are all included under the heading ' Tablas logaritmicas y
tablas para convertir partes de circulo en tiempo y viceversa.'

  A list of errata in the London edition of 1809 is given at the beginning

of the edition of 1850.

Roe. T. I. Seven-figure logarithms of numbers from 1 to 100,000,

with characteristics unscparated from the mantissas. All the figures of the

number are given at the heads of the columns, except the last two, which

run down the extreme columns ; 1 ... 50 on the left hand, and 50 . . . 100 on
the right-hand side. The first four figures (counting the characteristics) are

printed at the top of the columns. There is thus an advance halfway to-

wards the modern arrangement, and the final step was made by JohnXewton

(1658). This is the first complete seven-figure table that was published. It

is formed from Vlacq by leaving out the last three Ggiues, withoiit increasing

the seventh when they are greater than 500.

T. II. Logarithmic sines and tangents for every hundredth part of a

degree (viz. -^^-jj-^y part) of the quadrant, semiquadrantally arranged, to

10 places, with characteristics, which, however, are separated by a comma.

The work is very rare : the copy Ave have seen belongs to the lloyal Society.

Rumker, 1844. T. I. Six-figure logarithms of numbers from 1000 to

10,000, arranged consecutively in columns and divided into decades, with the

proportional parts for each decade by the side of it.

T. II. Log sines and tangents for every ten seconds to 2°, and log sines,

tangents, and secants for every minute from 0° to 45°, with ditlcrences, to

6 places ; the logarithms written at length.
   T. III. Xatural versed sines to every minute to 180°, with proportional

parts for the seconds, to (5 places.

--table gives instead of oo).

   T. XXIV. Proportional logarithms for every second to 3°, to 4 places

same as T. 74 of IIapeh.

In all cases the logarithms are written at length. The other tables are

nautical.

   ^Salomon, 1827. This Avork avc have not seen ; but as Eogg has given
a description of several of the tables, and we see no likelihood of meeting

--with the book, we here give his account. There are 13 tables, of which

the most noteworthy are the following :

stated) of all numbers from 1 to 10,000 conveniently arranged.

   T. IX. Logarithmic canon for every second of the first two degrees, and

then for every ten seconds of the rest of the quadrant (to 6 or 7 places, wo

suppose).

   T. XII. Natural sines and tangents for every minute, with diflPercnces. Kogg
adds that the printing and paper are good for Germany, but that he has made no
comparison to determine the correctness of the table ; the two pages of errata,
however, show (he remarks) that there was not so much care taken as with
Sherwin, Gaemnkr, Callet, Hutxon, Taylor, or Vega. Hogg's account is to
be found on pp. 254 and 399 of his ' Bibliotheca.' See also Gernorth's tract.

to 108,000 (the last 8000 being to 8 places), with proportional parts to' one

is denoted by an asterisk prefixed to the fourtli figure of all the logarithms
affected. The degrees, minutes, &c. corresponding to every number (regarded
as that number of seconds) in the left-hand column, and also corresponding
to these numbers divided by 10, are given. At the bottom of the page also S

the paper very good. The tables are of their land very complete indeed.

We have seen errata in this work advei-tised in different numbers of

Grunert's ' Archiv der Mathematik und Physik.' See Schron, 1865, below.

   Schrbn (London edition), 1865. De Morgan remarked that in England,

though tliere existed minute- and second-tables of trigonometrical functions,

there was no good ten-second table ; and on learning from the publishers

that an English edition of kSchkon was contemplated, he offered to write a

short preface, as, accuracy being taken for granted, these appeared to him to

be the most powerful and best ten-second tables ho had seen : his oft'er, how-
ever, was accompanied by the condition that a careful examination should be
made by Mr. Farley, sufficient to judge of the accuracy of the work, and that

the result should bo satisfactory. Mr. Farley accordingly examined 24 pages

selected at hazard, wholly by differences and partly by comparison with

Callet                                 and the pages were found to be totally free from error ;         so that the
                                ;

general accuracy of the tables was assured. They arc printed from the

same plates as in the German edition described above ; and the tabular matter

in the two seems identical in all respects.

Schulze, 1778. [T. I.] Seven-figure logarithms to 1000, and from

10,000 to 101,000, with differences and proportional parts. The proportional

parts at the beginning of the table, which are very numerous, arc printed on

a folding sheet.

A. page at the end of this table contains the first nine multiples of the

modulus and its reciprocal, to 48 places ; also c to 27 places, and its square,
cube .... to its 25th power, also its 30th and 60th powers, the number of

decimals decreasing as the integral portion increases. Log tt (hyperbolic and

Briggian) is also given.

   [T. II.] Wolfram's hyperbolic logarithms of numbers to 48 places. The
numbers run from unity to 2200 at intervals of unity, and thence to 10,009,
only not for all numbers ; " von 2200 bis 10,000 ist sie hingegen nur f iir die
Prim- imd etwas stark componirtc Zahlen berechnet, weil das Uebrige durch
leichtes Addiren kaun gefundcn werdcn " (Preface). De Morgan says " for
all numbers not divisible by a single digit;"' but this is incorrect, as 2219,

2225, &c. are divisible by single digits, while 9S09 (least factor 17), 9847
(least factor 47) do not occur. In fact, at first a great many composite
numbers are tabulated, and near the end very few, if any. All the primes,

however, seem to be given ; and by the aid of Wolfram's tables we may

regard all hyperbolic logarithms of numbers below 10,000 as known. Space
is left for six logarithms, which Wolfram had been prevented from computing
by a serious Ulness. These were supplied in the ' Eerliner Jahrbuch,' 1 783,
p. 191. Mr. Gray points out an error in Wolfram's table; viz. in log 14()9,
.... 1660 ... . should be .... 1 696 .... (' Tables for the formation &c.,' 1 865,

p. 38).

The Napierian logarithms (see first page of Preface to the second volume) are
taken from the ' Canon Mirificus ' of Napier, augmented by Ursinus. The
arrangement of the table is not very convenient, but perhaps the best

possible.

    [T. VIII.] Powers, as far as the eleventh, of decimal fractions from '0 to

Acontain specific gravities &c.  table on the last page is for the conversion

of minutes and seconds of arc into decimals of an hour.

  A table headed Jiaiionale Trigonometrie occupies pp. 308-311 , and is very

interesting. It gives right-angled triangles whose sides are rational and

such that tan |w (w being one of the acute angles of the triangle) is
greater than J^. Such triangles (though not so called here) are often known

as Pythagorean. Those with sides 3, 4, and 5 ; and 5, 12, and 1.3 are the
1)est-known cases; and 8, 15, and 17, 9, 40, and 41, 20, 21, and 29, &c. are
among the next in point of simplicity. This table contains 100 such tri-

angles ; but some occur twice. It gives in fact a table of integer values of

a, b, c, satisfying (r-\-h'-=c-, subject to the condition mentioned above:

tan iio, expressed both as a vulgar fraction and as a decimal, is given, as also

--are w and 90° w. For a larger table of the same kind, see Sang, 'Edinburgh

Transactions,' t. xxiii. p. 757, 1864. On the whole, this collection of tables

is very useful and valuable.

T. VI. Log sines for every second to 3°, to five places. There is no name

at all on the table ; but it is assigned (and no doubt correctly) to Schumacher

in the Royal Society's Librarj- ; and De Morgan, speaking of Waexstoeff's
ScnuMACHER (1845), says that the original publication was Altona, 1822;
but there was an earlier edition, we believe, at Copenhagen, in 1820.

teiid to Qio.osn^ifi ' While the Tvork was passing through the press Mr,

Shanks extended his value of tt to 607 decimals ; and to this number of
places it is given on pp. 86 and 87 of the book.

as 2^^' (which contains 212 figures).

   On p. 89 are given the values of <;, log, 2, log^3, log, 5, and log, 10, to 137

places, and the modulus to 130. Values of these quantities were given also
by Mr. Shanks to 205 places (I'roc. Roy. Soc. vol. vi. p. 397). The value of e
was verified by the reporter to 137 places by calculation from a continued
fraction (see Erit. Assoc, lleport, 1871, pp. 16-18, sectional proceedings).
The same writer also showed in vol. xix. p. 521 of the ' Proceedings of the
lloyal Society,' that Mr. Shanks's values of log 2, 3, 5, and 10 were inaccurate
after the 59th place (all owing to one error in a series on which they depended),
and deduced the correct values to 100 places. These results were verified by

Mr. Shanks, who has recalculated the values of these logarithms, as well as
that of the modulus, to 205 places : they are published in vol. xx. p. 27 of

the 'Proceedings of the Royal Society' (1871).
    Mr. Shanks's 607-place value is given in Knight's 'English Cyclojjsedia,'

(Art. "Quadrature of the Circle") copied from the work under notice ; and it

Ahas been verified by a subsequent calculation of llicliter to 500 places.

list of the calculators of tt, the number of places, &c. to which they have
extended their calculations, with references to the places where they aro
to be found, is given by Bierens de Haan on a page at the beginning of his
" Tables d'lntegrales Definies " in t. iv. of the Amsterdam Transactions.

This page, however, does not appear in the separate copies of the tables
(the ' Nouvelles Tables,' Leyden, 1867). For an extended and corrected copy
of this list, see ' Messenger of Mathematics,' December 1872, and some addi-
tional corrections in the same Journal for July 1873 (t. iii. pp. 45, 46).

    Some years ago Mr. Slianks calculated the reciprocal of the prime number
17389 so as to exhibit the complete circulating period, consisting of 17388
figures, and placed a copy of it in the Archives of the Royal Society. Quite
recently he has extended his calculation of w to 707 decimal places (Proc.
Roy. Soc. vol. xxi. p. 318). Mr. Shanks has sent us three corrections to this
paper : viz. the 459th, 460th, and 461st decimals in n should be 962 instead
of 834, and the 513th, 514th, and 515th decimals should be 065 instead of
193; also the 75th decimal of tan "'4- should be 8 instead of 7. The two
corrections in tt applj' also to the work under notice.

taken as unity ; and the argument is the vei-sed sine (or height of the
segment), the diameter being taken as unity. The table then gives areas to
17 places for arguments -0001 to -5000 at intervals of -0001, with difierences.
Thus, strictly, the argument is the ratio of the height of the segment to the
diameter, and the tabular result the ratio of the area of the segment to that
 of the whole circle. The table occupies 50 pp., and is the largest of the kind

we have seen.

riglit circular cones, tlie segment being contained by the base of the cone (a
segment of a circle), a hyperbolic section perpendicular to the base, and the
curved surface. The use of the table (which contains 500 values of the
argument and occupies 5 pp.) is explained on pp. 24--26 of the work.

logarithms in this table were copied into the later editions of Shekwin and

other works.

   The portion of the work which contains the tables is followed by a
" Concise treatise of Polyedra, or solid bodies of many bases " (pp. 32).

   The work is universally attributed to Abraham Sharp, and no doubt exists

as to his having been tlie author.

   De Morgan states that the work was issued under the title given in § .5 in
1840, and tAVO years previously without name or titlepage. It is from one of

these earlier copies that the above description has been written ; we have
seen no copy bearing either author's name or date.

   Sherwin, 1741. [T. I.] (which follows p. 35 of the introduction) gives

Briggian logarithms to 61 places of all numbers to 99, and the logarithms of
primes from 100 to 1097, calculated by Abraham Sharp (see Suarp, 1717,

[T. IV.]).

   [T. II.] Briggian logarithms of thirty-five other numbers (viz. 99.9,981

-- 1,000,015), to Gl places, with first, second, third, and fourth differences,

 to 101,000, with proportional parts. The proportional parts near the begin-

 ning of the table, being too voluminous for insertion on the page, are printed

 on a fl}'- sheet, and bound up facing the introductory page of the table.

     [T. IV.] Natural and log sines, tangents, and secants for every minute, to

 seven places. Differences for the logarithmic functions are added, but not

 for the natural ones.

     [T. v.] Natural and log versed sines from 0° to 90° at intervals of a

minute, to seven places. Part of a page at the end of [T. V.] is occupied by

 a small table to convert sexagesimals into decimals, &c., and vice versa.
    The remaining table (of difference of latitude and departure) is not in-

 cluded in this llcport (see § 2, art. 12).

    Sherwin went through five editions ; but as none were stereotyped, some of

the later are less accurate than the earher. De Morgan remarks, " Second

--edition, 1717; third revised by Gardiner, and the best, 1742; fifth and last,

1771, very erroneous the most inaccurate table Hutton ever met with."

In speaking of the third edition we at first thought that De Morgan should
probably have written 1741 instead of 1742, as the edition we have described
bears the former date, but we have since seen a copy of 1742.

   Wo possess an edition (1726) which contains a list of " Errata for the

second edition of Sherwin's Mathematical Tables " by Gardiner. In this edi-

tion, in place of [T. I.] and [T. II.] there are given two pages (pp. 28 and 29)
headed " M. Brigg's {sic) Logarithms for all Numbers, from 1 to 100, and for
all Ffime Numbers from 100 to 200, calculated by that Ingenious Gentleman
and Indefatigable Mathematician, Mr. Abr. Sharp, at Little Horton, near
Bradford in Yorkshire." The logarithms are given to from 50 to 60 places
(not all to the same extent).

   We have also before us an edition of 1706 ; and the dedication, which is

the same in aU the editions we have seen, is dated July 12, 1705. The table
on pp. 27 and 28 is the same as in the edition of 1726 ; but at the end of the

introduction is a table of errata, which are corrected in this latter edition.
The titlepage of the editions of 1705, 1706, and 1726, and perhaps other
dates, runs, " Mathematical Tables. . . .with their Construction and Use by
Mr. Briggs, Mr. Wallis, Mr. Halley, Savilian Professors of Geometry in the
University of Oxford, Mr. Abr. Sharp" (the names of the authors being

placed one under the other); and in the edition of 1700 is added, "The

whole being more correct and comjjlete than any Tables extant." Sherwin's
name docs not, therefore, occur on the titlepage at aU ; but the preface is
signed and the tables were prepared by him, so that the work is universally
known as " Sherwin's Tables." In library catalogues, however, it wDl gene-
rally be found entered under the name of Briggs, Wallis, Halley, or Sharp.

   In the edition of 1741, the names of Briggs, Wallis, Halley, and Sharp do

not appear on the titlepage, but we have "The third edition, carefully

re^^scd and corrected by William Gardiner " instead.

   It will be seen that there is some confusion in the editions, as, if De
Morgan is correct in saying that the second edition was published in 1717,

the edition of 1726 would be the third, and that of 1741 the fourth.

   The Royal Society's Library contains a copy with "1705" on the title-

page, while the edition of 1706 (which is in the library of Trinity College,

Cambridge) has the date printed in Eoman characters, MDCCVI.

  We have seen (in the Graves Library) the fourth edition, 1761; and the

British Museum contains, besides the editions of 1717 and 1742, the fifth

edition, " revised and improved by S. Clark " (1772), while the Cambridge
University Library has the same edition with the date 1771.

    The editions ^ye have Been are 1705 and 1706, 1717, 1726; the third

edition 1741 and 1742, the fourth 1761, and the fifth 1771 and 1772. It

thus appears that it was uot at all an uncommon thing (probably as the

impression was being made up from time to time) to advance the date by one
year. The first four dates we may distribute among the first two editions as
we please ; most likely 1705, 1706, and 1717 for the first, and 1726 for the

second.

    Hogg (p. 401) gives the editions as 1706, 1742, 1763, and 1771 ; but else-

where (p. 262) he speaks of the fifth as of 1785, which must be incorrect.

   De Haan (' lets over Logarithmentafels,' p. 57) gives the dates of the

editions as 1706, 1717, 1726, second 1742, 1751, 1763, fifth 1771. The

subject of the dates of the editions of Sherwin is discussed at some length in

the ' Monthly Notices of the Eoyal Astronomical Society ' for March and

May 1873 (vol. xxxiii. pp. 344, 454, 455, 457). Mr. Lewis, in his letter

to the reporter, printed in the second of these papers, mentions 1717, 1742,

1761, and 1771 as the dates of the editions he had seen, agreeing perfectly

with those mentioned by De Morgan, Lalande (' Eibliog. Astron.'), and the

results of our own observation. He remarks that Barlow gives 1704 and

Callet 1724 as dates of editions, of which the former may bo dismissed at

once as an obvious blunder. The editions therefore tliat we have not seen,

but which mai/ exist, are those of 1724, 1751, and 1763. About any of
these or any others we should be glad to receive information.

    Eogg mentions that Skerwin has often been confounded with Gardinee,

even by Kiistner and Bugge.

   With regard to the accuracy of the tables, Httttoit writes (we quote from

--p. 40 of the Introduction to his tables, 3rd edit. 1801) : " The first edition

was in     1706                       but the third edition, in              1742, which was revised by Gardiner,
                                   ;

is esteemed the most correct of any, though containing many thousands of

errors in the final figures : as to the last or fifth edition, in 1771, it is so erro-

neously printed that no dependence can be placed in it, being the most in-

accurate book of tables I ever knew ; I have a list of several thousand errors

which I have corrected in it, as well as ia Gardiner's octavo edition."

   De Haan ('lets' &c., p. 20), speaking of the 1742 edition, says that it

contains the logarithms of the numbers from 999,980 to 1,000,020 to 61

places ; but on examination we find that the above descrii^tion of [T, II.] is
correct. The advertisement to the book itself is no doubt the source of the

error ; for it is there said to contain the logarithms of the 41 numbers from

999,980 to 1,000,020, whereas it rcaUy contains the logarithms of the 35-

numbers from 999,981 to 1,000,015.

    Sherwin's tables are of historical interest as forming part of the main line

of  descent  from Briggs                                                and  the different editions cover the greater part of
                                                                     ;

bers)  is  Briggs, Yiacq, Eoe, Joitn Newton, Skerwin, Gardiner                                                                                                                                                                                                         and  then:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

there are two branches, viz. Hutton founded on Sherwin, and Callet on

Gardiner, the editions of Vega forming an offshoot.

   Shortrede (Compendious logarithmic tables), 1844. Small tables of
common logarithms with sexagesimal arguments, logarithms to 12,600, anti-

logarithms from to -999, log sines and tangents to 5', also from 0° to S\

ber of degrees, minutes, and seconds corresponding to the numbers in the

number-column multiplied by 10 is given throughout ; and at the top of every

page are printed, to seven places, the logarithms of certain constants, viz.

of 360°, 180°, 90°, 1°, 2i\ 12^ 3\ 1^, and radius (all expressed in seconds)
Mof arc 1", TT and
                    the modulus. The change of figure in the line is

denoted by a " nokta," the same as that employed subsequently by Mr. Sang

(see Sang, § 3, art. 13) ; and its use is open to the same objections here as

there.

T. II. Antilogarithms, viz, numbers to logarithms from "00000 to 1*00000

at intervals of -00001, to 7 places, with diiferences and multiples at the

bottom of the page. The same logarithms of constants are given on the top

of the page as in T. I. ; and the change in the line is denoted in the same
way. At the end of this table (p. 1 95), under the head " Useful Numbers,"
the logarithms of some constants are given.

    T. III. (pp. 59S). Log sines and tangents to every second of the circnni'
ference, to 7 places (semiquadrantally arranged), the arguments throughout

being also given in time. The use of the word circumference instead of

quadrant in this description is justified by the fact that the signs are given

for the diiferent quadrants at the top and bottom of the page : thus we have on

--the first page, at the top, 0° Sin +, 90° Cos--, 180° Sin , 270° Cos +, and

at the bottom 89° Cos +, 179° Sin +, 269° Cos -, 359° Cos -, and the same

for the tangent and cotangent, the arguments being also expressed in

time. Complete proportional parts are given throughout for tenths of a

second of space, and for the first six hundredths of a second of time, both

for the sine and tangent ; but near the beginning of the tables coefficients of

correction for first and (sometimes) second differences are added instead. The

arguments, as before stated, are given also in time ; so that corresponding to

1", 2'', 3", &c. we have -06% -13', -20', &c. This table is the most complete of
the kind we know of, and is unique ; the figures are clear ; and the objection
to the "nokta" docs not apply here; in one column (p. 142) there are tivo

changes on the page.

T. V. Seven-place log sines, tangents, and secants to every point and

quarter point of the compass.

.... 180°, of r, 2', . . . . 60', of 1", 2", .... 60", and of 1'", 2'", .... 60'", to 7

places.

   T. XXXIX. Proportional parts to hundredths of the reciprocal of the

modulus, viz. 2-302 . . ., to 8 places.

  XXXV.There are thirty-nine tables in the book (T. XLI. is the last ; but
and XXXVI. are accidentally omitted), the others being astronomical or me-

teorological &c.

in 2 vols. There is a preface of xxv pages to vol. i. T. I. and II. are the
same as T. I. and II. in the 1844 edition; T. III. is a small ten-

place table of the lengths of circular arcs. T. IV. and V. are for finding

+logarithms and antilogarithms to many places ; viz. colog (1  -Oln)

+ =,. .colog (1

   Then follow 2 or 3 pp. of barometric &c. tables, and a page of constants

(including a small table of log  --, and the same for the tangent).

   The second volume contains T. III. of the 1844 edition, followed by some

spherical-trigonometry formulae, and the same page of constants as in vol. i.

   In the advertisement to the second (1849) edition, Shortrede says "a

small edition of this work was published in 1844, before I had an opportu-

nity of seeing it complete, which in several respects was such as I did not
like. In the present edition many alterations have been made to conform it

more to my views ; and for the convenience of purchasers it is now published

in two separate volumes." The prices of the two volumes are, Vol. 1. 12s., and

Vol. II. 30s. ; it is worth noting this, as we have seen it stated that the price

of Shortrede's logarithms (by which some might understand the whole work)

is 125. De Morgan says, " They [Shortrede's tables] first appeared in

1844; but some defects and errors having been found, the edition of 1844
was cancelled, and a new edition from corrected plates issued in 1849."

This may be true ; but although "we have seen four copies of the 1844 edi-
tion in difi'erent libraries, we were not able to obtain a sight of the 1849
edition anywhere till we bought it. Our copy of Vol. i. is dated 1849,- and of

Vol. ii. 1858. There are few tables in which, relatively to the number of

fgures, the pages are so clear, and the logarithmic canon to seconds is much
the most complete we have seen. Every one must agree with De_ Morgan
that the work shows extraordinary energy and public spirit. This is the

most complete second canon in existence, and is the most accessible. Only

two others have been published :--Michael Taylor, 1792, which has several

defects attending its use ; and Bagay, 1829, which is scarce.

   A list of twenty-six errors (nearly all in the antilogarithms) is given by

Shortrede himself in the 'Monthly Notices of the Eoyal Astronomical
Society' for January 1864; and a supplemental list is added in the same

publication for May 1867, where he says that "the unauthorized issue in

1844 contains several others." One erratum is also given in the 'Monthly

Notice ' for April 1867. Shortrede adds that the great majority of the

errata were communicated to him bj' Mr. Peter Gray.
    In the ' Insurance Eecord ' Mr. Fxlipowski charged Shortrede with having

corrected his table by the aid of his (Filipowski's). That the charge was
utterly unfounded is proved by the letter of Mr. Peter Gray (' Insurance
Record,' June 9, 1871), who states that the errata in Dodsox were given tv
Shortrede by himself (Mr. Gray) ; and we have seen reason to impute un-
 fairness to Mr. Fihpowski in another matter with regard to Dodson (su
 FiLiPOWsKi, 1849, § 4). Mr. Gray has kindly placed at our disposal his
copious list of errors in Dodson, of which we hope to make use in a sub-

 sequent Heport.

     Shortrede did not pay sufficient attention to the examination of the errata-

 lists of previous works ; and, in consequence, his tables contain a much greater

 number of the hereditary errors that had descended from Vlacq than do the
                                                                        ;.

cept iu so far as they show the acquaintance of the author of a table with
the works of his predecessors, Shortredc was absent in India during the
publication of the 184-1 edition (which contains seven of these errors) ; but

that of 1849 was published under his own superintendence, and still it con-

tains six, while Ijabbage, Hulsse's Vega, and other works of earlier date
have but one. See ' Monthly Notices of the Eoy. Ast. Soc.,' March 1873,

appear on the titlepage.

ON MATHEMATICAL TABLES.  133

  --At the cud of tlio preface Mrs. Taylor makes the following curious re-

 mark : " Some errors have crept into the calculations from the multiplicity

 of entries &c. ; these, I trust, will claim the indulgence of the public ; for

 the system on which I have worked being mathematically correct, and
 founded on sound principles, any slight oversight in the figures can be of
 but little moment, and very easily rectified." It is to be presumed that this
 does not refer to the tables included in this Eeport, as they would not havo

 been calculated afresh.
     Mrs. Taylor was also the author of a work on navigation, the tables in

 which arc described below.

 quarter point, to 6 places.

     T. 4. Six-figure logarithms of numbers to 10,000.

 in the Minorics.

  places.

     [T. II.] Logarithms of numbers from 10,000 to 101,000, to 7 places, with
 differences and proportional parts. The change in the tliird figure, in the

 middle of the line is not marked.
     [T. III.] Table of log sines and tangents to every second of the quadrant,

 to 7 places (semiquadrantally arranged). The change in the leading figures,
 when it occurs in the middle of the column, is not marked at all ; and it
 requires very great care in using the table to prevent errors from this
 cause. If any one is likely to have to make much use of the table, it will
 be worth his while to go through the whole of it, and fiU in with ink the first

    after the change (making it a black circle such as is used to denote full

 moon in almanacs), and also to make some mark that will catch the eye at
 the top of every column containing a change. This will be a work of con-

 siderable labour, but is absolutely necessary to ensure accuracy. It is uo
 doubt chiefly on account of the absence of any mark at a change that
 Bagat has so completely superseded this table, though difference of size &c.

 are also in favour of the former.
     [T. I.] and [T. II.] present no novelty ; but [T. III.] is an enormous table,

 containing about 450 pages, with an average number of about 7750 figures
 to a page, so that it contains nearly three milhons and a half of figures.
 The left-hand pages contain sines and cosines, the right-hand tangents and
 cotangents. This is unfortunate, as the sines and cosines (which are used
 far more frequently than the tangents and cotangents) are thus separated
 at least a foot from the computer's paper as he works with the table on his
 left ; and it is well known that the number of errors of transcription is
* proportional to the distance the eye has to carry the numbers, [T. III.] was
 calculated by interpolation from YLAca's ' Trigonometria Ai-tificiahs,' to 10
 places, and then contracted to 7 ; so that the last figure should always^ be
 correct. Taylor was a computer in the Nautical Almanac Office ; he unfor-
 tunately died almost at the moment of the completion of his work, only five
  pages remaining unfinished in the press at the time of his death. These

were cxamiued, and the introduction &c. written, by Maskelync. Some
errata, found among Taylor's papers, are given on p. 64 of the work ; and a
list of nineteen errata signed by Pond is published iu the ' Nautical Almanac'

--for 1833. To this list is appended the remark: "The above errata were

detected by collating Taylor's Logarithms with tlic French manuscript tables,

now the property of C. Babbage, Esq. The arrangement for this examina-
tion was made by the late lamented Dr. Young ; a few days only before his

--death he gave directions for its completion. J. Pond."

  We do not know any thing further with regard to this examination, though

the fact that certain errors were found in Taylor by comparison with the

French tables is weU known ; but there must be some mistake, as the French

tables could not have been even temporarily the property of Babbage. In
the preface to his tables Babbage states that while on a visit to Paris he

availed himself of the opportunity of consulting the great manuscript tables
presei'ved at the Observatory, and'that he " enjoyed every facility for making

the comparisons which were requisite for this purpose [the preparation of his

seven-figure table], as well as making extracts necessary to me for other

calculations."

   Bagay intimates in his preface that he had found 76 errors in Taylor.
   Taylor was also the author of the Sexagesimal Table (§ 3, art. 9) ; and we
cannot but admire the undaunted perseverance that could enable him to com-
plete such monuments of industry in addition to his routine work as computer

in a laborious office.

arguments and tabular results to the page. The tables begin at the last page,

as before remarked, the extreme right-hand column being the first column of
arguments ; to the left of it is the corresponding column of tabular results,

then to the left of that the second column of arguments, and so on. The

table occupies 84 pp. (up to p. 85). Then " ^Uows " a table of log sines and

a similar table of natural sines and tangents (to 7 places), which also occupies

90 pp. Except that the table runs in the wrong dii-ection, it only differs from

an ordinary table in the ten digits being denoted by different marks from

sufficient to get used to the new numerals ; and then the table could be used

the first two or three figures of the difference. The table can thus be used

Aas an ordinary seven-figure table.           change in the fourth figure in the

middle of the line is denoted by an asterisk prefixed to all the logarithms

affected. T. I. occupies pp. 1-310. The last page and a half arc devoted to
multiples of the modulus, a few constants, and a tabic to convert degrees (1°

to 360°) and minutes (1' to 60') into seconds.

   T. II. (Magnus Canon logarithmorum vulgarium trigonometricus). Log
sines, cosines, tangents, and cotangents, from 0° to 2° at intervals of one

second, to 10 places, without differences, and for the rest of the quadrant at

intervals of ten seconds, also to 10 places, with differences. All this occupies

pp. 311-629, and is followed by 3 pp. containing natural sines for angles less
than twelve minutes, to every second, to 12 places.

   The appendix occupies pp. 633-685 : p. 633 contains formulte ; and pp. 634
and 635 are occupied with tables of the longitudes of circular arcs &c. Of these

the first gives the circular measure of 1°, 2°, 3°, . . . . 360°, the second of 1', 2',
U3',
       60', the third of 1", 2", 3",          60", aU to                       places ; the fourth is a

small table to express minutes and seconds as fractions of a degree. Pp. 636-

640 are occupied with formuhc for the solution of triangles ; and on pp. 641-
684 [T. III.] we have Wolfram's great table of hyperbolic logarithms (see

ScHTJLZE, § 4). The six omittcil in ScmjLZE are given ; and it is stated in the
preface that several errors have been corrected. The error pointed out by Mr.

Gray (see Scuulze [T. II.]) is reproduced. An error in log^ 1099 is pointed

out by Prof. Wackerbarth in the ' Monthly Notices of the Iloyal Astronomical

Society' for April 1867.

   Some of the errata found in Ylacq are indicated in the preface. These are,
as a rule, corrected in the book ; others, given in a list at the end of the in-
troduction, were found after the printing, and must be corrected in manu-

script before use. There is a third list at the end of the work (p. 685) ; but
it is identical with that at the end of the introduction.

   In some copies the list at the end of the introduction is much more com-
plete than in others, the errors in Vlacq being marked by an asterisk, and the

errata being also given in Latin and German. It is probable that additional
errata were found before the edition was all made up, and that the original

list was suppressed and the new one substituted. In all copies the titlepage

is the same. See ' Monthly Notices of the Eoy. Ast. Soc.,' June 1872, and

May 1873 (p. 454).

   There is a great difference in the appearance of different copies of the work.
In some the tables are beautifully printed on thick white paper, with wide

have seen ; while in others the paper is thin and discoloured ; all arc printed

from the same type.

The arrangement of T. I. (though about half the space that would be required

if the logarithms and differenees were written at length is thereby saved) is not

nearly so convenient as in Vlacq ; 1628, for there is danger of taking out a
wroug difference. Yega took great pains to free his tables of logarithms of num-

bers from error ; and he detected all the hereditary errors that had descended

from Vlacq which affected the first seven figures of the logarithms. But as

several of these errors were corrected in his errata-list and not in the text, his

successors, who failed to study these lists sufiiciently, were reaUy less accurate

than he was. The last thousand logarithms that appear for the first time in

this work were calculated by Lieut. Dorfmund at Vega's instigation.

T. II. is not reprinted entirely from Vlacq's ' Trigonometria Artificialis,*

as the logarithms for every second of the first two degrees Avere calculated for

the work by Lieut. Dorfmund. Vega seems not to have bestowed on the tri-

gonometrical canon any thing approaching to the care he devoted to the loga-

rithms of numbers, as Gauss estimates the number of last-figure errors at from

31,983 to 47,746 (most of them only amounting to a unit, but some to as

much as 3 or even 4).
   Vega offered a reward of a ducat for every error found in his table ; and

it is to be inferred fi'om his preface that he intended to regard inaccuracies of
a unit as such, so that it was fortunate that no contemporary of his made an
examination similar to Gauss's. The paper of Gauss's in which this estimate
occurs is entitled " Einige Bemerkungen zu Vega's Thesaurus Logarithmo-

rum," and appeared in the ' Astronomische Nachrichten,' No. 756, for May 2,

1851 (reprinted ' Werke,' t. iii. pp. 257-264). It contains an examination

of the relative numbers and magnitudes of the last-figure errors that occur
in the sine, cosine, and tangent columns. It is easily shown that the tan-

gents were formed by mere  subtraction from  the sine  and cosine  columns
                                                                                                 ;

but Gauss was unable to explain the fact that the cosines were more accu-

rate than the sines, which appeared as one of the results of the examination.
This question is further discussed in the ' Monthly Notices of the Eoy. Ast.

Soe. ' for May 1873 ; and it is there shown by the reporter that this result is

a direct consequence of the formula by means of which Vlacq calculated the

table. So long as all these errors remain uncorrected, the logarithmic trigo-

nometrical canon cannot be considered to be in a satisfactory state, as it is

certainly desirable that a reliable ten-place table should exist.

   "We believe no perfect list of errors in Vega has been given : a number of

errors in T. I. are given by Lefort (' Annales de I'Observatoire de Paris,'
t. iv.) ; but this list could not, from the manner in which it was formed, in-

clude any errors that did not also occur in Vlacq.

  A long list of errors in the trigonometrical tables of Vega is given by

Gronau, ' Tafeln fiir die hyperbolischen Sectoren' &e. Dantzig, 1862, p. vi.

of 40 more pages, containing log sines and tangents from 0° for every

The rest of the book is devoted to astronomical tables and formiilfe, except

two remarkable tables at the end (pp. 364-371). The first of these [T. VII.]

is most simply desci'ibed by stating that it gives the number of shot in a py-

ramidal pile on a square base, the number n of shot in the side of the base

n=2 =being the argument ; the table extends from
                                               to n 40. There is also

given the number of shot in a pyramidal pile on a rectangular base, tlie ar-

mguments being n the number of shot in the breadth of the base, and the
m+n --number of shot in the top row (so that
                                               1 is the number in the length

of the base). The ranges are, for ?i, 2 to 40, andfor jji, 2 to 44, the table being

of double entry.

[T. VIII.] gives the number of shot in a pyramidal pile on a triangular

base, the number of shot in a side of the base being the argument, which
extends from 2 to 40. The other portion of the table is headed " Tabula

pro acervis globorum oblongis, ab utraque extremitate ad pyramides quadri-

--latei'as appositis;" and the explanation is as follows: Suppose we have

two pyramidal piles of shot on square bases (n shot on each side) placed

mfacing one another, at a distance equal to the sum of the diameters of shot

apart ; and suppose it is required to fill this interval up, so as to make a pyra-

midal pile on a rectangular base, then this table gives the number for n (latus)

mto n=40, and for (longitude baseos) to mi =44, the table being of double

entry.

Some errata are given after the introduction.

   "We have seen the third edition (Leipzig, 1812) ; aiid though wo have not
compared it side by side with the second (here described), we feel no doubt

the contents are identical ; at all events the number of pages in each volume

8 the same, and the preface is dated 1797 in both.

   In the English copies, by George Miller, there is an English introduction

of 54 pp., and then follows a table of latitudes (8 pp.). The original edition

of 1G28 has 79 pp. of introduction ; and a list of errata is given, which does

not occur in Miller's copies (but see ' Monthly Notices of the Eoy. Ast. Soc'

t. xxxiii. pp. 452, 456, May, 1873).

There were also copies with a French titlepage ; and in these there is an

WeIntroduction in the same language of 84 pp.  suspect that a Dutch edition

was contemplated, but that the copies of the table intended for this purpose

afterwards formed Miller's English edition : no Dutch edition is known to

exist (see Phil. Mag., May 1873). The titles of the three editions are given

in full in § 5 ; in all, the tabular portion is from the same type. The bibli-
ograjjhy of this work forms an essential part of the history of logarithms ; and
a good many of the references occurring in the introductory remarks to § 3,

art. 13, have reference to it.

The table of logarithms of numbers contains about 300 errors, exclusive

of those affecting the last figure by a unit ; but a good many of these have

reference to the portion below 10,000, which need never be used. This is

still the most convenient ten-figure table there is (Vega, fol. 1794, is the only

othei') but before use the known errata should be corrected. References to
                                ;

   [The 1838 edition (or rather tirar/c) has the following notice of errata
contained in it, on the back of the titlepagc : " In the logarithms of 10354,
G0670 to 9, 70634 to 9, and 106611 to 9, the fourth figures ought to be
small instead of large. In the list of constants the last figure of the value
of e should be 8 instead of 9." The tables were stereotyped from their first

publication in 1827. Mr. W. Barrett Davis has called our attention to the

number of last- figure unit errors iu the portion of the table beyond 100,000
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

thus on p. 192 there are no less than fifteen such errors which are corrected
in more recent works, such as Schron and Ivohler. This portion of the
table Babbage copied from Callet.]

[The above is a transcript of the titlepage of the ' Construetio;' but in the only

copy of this work that we have seen it is immediately preceded by an ornamental

titlepage, which, as far as the ornamentation is concerned, is a facsimile ol that

of the ' Descriptio,' 1614. The letterpress, however, is very difi'erent, and runs,

" Mirifici logarithmorum canonis descriptio, Ejusque usus, in utraque Tri-

gonometria                                                             ut etiam in omni  Logistica  Mathematica, amplissimi, facillimi,

Hart. Anno 1619." This would imply that the ' Descriptio' and ' Construetio'

were issiied together in 1619 ; and whether this was so or not, it shows that

such was intended. Some writers speak of a rei>rint of tlie ' Descriptio ' in
1619 ; but this title may be all their authority, as few of those who have

written on the subject seem to have looked beyond the titlepages of the

works they were noticing. On the other hand, of course, the 'Descriptio' may

have been torn out from the copy before us. The ' Construetio' is a much

rarer work than the ' Descriptio ;' we have seen half a dozen copies of the

latter and but one of the former (Camb. Univ. Lib.). In any case, as

the leading words of the title of the ' Construetio' (on the first titlepage) are

" Mirifici logarithmorum canonis descriptio," it could only be distinguished

Wefrom the ' Descriptio' in most library catalogues by the date 1619.                               have

thought it worth while, since the description in § 3, art. 17 (p. 73), was
printed, to add the first title of the work containing the ' Construetio,' and to

point out the uncertainty relating to the reprint of the ' Descriptio,' in hopes

that some one may settle the matter. The 1619 edition of the 'Descriptio'

(supposing there to have been one of this date) is the only book of importance

relating to the early spread of logarithms of which we have seen no copy

and the question of its publication is almost the only point of bibliography,

in reference to the tables of this time, that we are obliged to leave iiudeeided

for the present.]

Art. 1. The foregoing Report is that which was presented to the Brighton

Meeting in 1872, considerably enlarged. After the Meeting it seemed de-

sirable to extend some of the articles in § 3, and to add descriptions of several
works to § 4 ; and it then appeared that the Report was so lengthy that it
was thought better to delay its publication till the ensuing volume, so as to

afford time for its passage through the press without undue haste. The

printing therefore was commenced in February or March, and is now

(September 30, 1873) all but finished. It was arranged, as the completion

of the Report by a supplement depended in great measure on the coopera-

tion of others possessing information on the subject of tables, that a certain

number of separate copies should be placed in the hands of the Committee,

as soon as the printing was effected, for circulation amongst those interested

in the matter, so as to avoid the delay of a year that would otherwise take

place before the work undertaken by the Committee became known to those
who could render assistance.

Art. 2. While the Report has been passing through the press a good many

alterations have been made which were necessitated by increased informa-

tion on the subjects treated of, and by repetitions &c. which were detected
for the first time when the whole appeared in print. But no attempt has

been made to increase the extent of the Report by introducing descriptions

of fresh works ; in fact only about a dozen have been added since the

Brighton Meeting, and but four or five since the MS. was placed in the printer's

hands.

The tendency of the Report has been fi-om the first to become more and

more bibliographical. Originally it was intended to introduce nothing of a

bibliographical nature                                                                                             but experience showed that this was impossible, and
                                                                                                                ;

Aattention to such matters has been continually forced upon us.                                                                                  report on
--tables differs from a report on any other scientific subject in this that

whereas in a progressive science the earlier works become superseded by
                                                                                  ;

their successors, and are only of historical interest, a table forms a piece of

work done, and, if done correctly, is done for all time. Thus Briggs, 1624,

or Vlacq, 1628, when procured, are as useful now as if the tables had been

calculated and published recently, subject to the one drawback, that it needs

a bibliographical research to determine how far their accuracy is to be relied

Aupon.  table is calculated for a special purpose, which purpose in process

of time ceases to be an object of practical interest, and the table is forgotten

but, for all that, it is the expression of a certain amount of abstract truth,

and as such is always of value, and is liable at any moment to be utilized

again for some other purpose. Thus one of the most useful objects of the

Report is to give in an accessible form accounts of old tables that have passed

out of notice, as even the most special table is never so obsolete that some

fresh use may not be found for it in the future ; and it is of little value to

describe an old and unimportant work without such additional explanation as

may lead to its easy identification, with references to the works that contain

information of importance to its user.

Art. 3. But, apart from the necessity of giving bibliographical information

with regard to some works in order to render the descriptions useful, it is to

be noticed that mathematical history is practically nothing but mathematical

bibliography, as the number of letters and other manuscript documents bear-

ing upon the subject is very small. This being so, it seemed a pity when the

examination of any work showed it to possess some interest, even though of

a purely historical kind, to ignore it entirely merely because the table it

contained was clearly destitute of practical value*. The whole additional

space thus devoted to bibliography does not altogether amount to more than

a very few pages ; and the chief concession that has been made to it is in the

list of titles in § 5, where in several cases the full titlepage has been tran-
scribed. This, with one or two exceptions, has only been done in the case

of the tables of logarithms immediately following their invention in 1614.

An examination of a great number of works of reference in regard to this

matter has shown us how inaccurate, not only in details but even in pro-

minent facts, are the accounts usually given. With the exception of

Delambre, Lalande (in his ' Bibliographic Astronomique '), and De Morgan,

it is not too mvich to say that not a single writer on the subject is to be

trusted. Those only who have had occasion to investigate any historical

point, like that of the invention of logarithms, can appreciate the slight value

that was set on accuracy previously to the dawning of a more careful age at

the beginning of the present century. It is necessary to give this caution, as

any one who took the trouble to compare certain statements made in this

Heport with those given in such works as Thomson's ' History of the Eoyal

Society,' or even Hallam's ' Literature of Europe ' (founded on earlier works),

might imagine that our account involved matters of opinion and was liable

to be disputed ; whereas we cannot find that any previous writer ever did

(or perhaps could in the then state of Kbraries) examine or even see all the

works relating to this period. It is also worthy of remark that the early

logarithmic tables form a most remarkable bibliographical tangle. For some

years it was customary to always place the name of J!fapier on the titlepages

   * " It would be something towards a complete collection of mathematical bibliography,
if those who have occasion to examine old works, and take a pleasure in doing it,
would add each his quotum, in the shape of description of such works as he has actually
seen, without any attempt to appear more learned than his opportunities hare made

--him." De Morgan, 'Arithmetical Books,' p. x. See also 'Companion to the Almanac,'

1851, p. 5.

--166 REPORT 1873.

of works on logarithms, as being their inTentor, and, if the logarithms were

decimal, that of Briggs (and perhaps also that of Ylacq) in addition. Thus

the ' Arithmetica ' of 1628 will be found in bibliographies and library cata-

logues usually under the name of Napier or Briggs, and very rarely under

that of its author Vlacq. If to this confusion be added the additional com-

plication produced by the varieties of ways in which the names of the three

leading logarithmic calculators were spelt, it may easily be inferred how

incorrect and confused is all the infonnation to be obtained from bibliogra-

phical sources, whether general or mathematical*. It is on this account

that we have thought it desirable to give the titles of these works in full in

§ 5. Perhaps it would not have been possible to sec so many of them
in any one other country except this ; and the value of a number of such

titles collectively in the same list is much greater than the sum of their

separate values when scattered in different works.

Art. 4. While on the subject of bibliography, it is proper to remark that,

in the cases where the full titles have been given in § 5, there is a certain

slight want of uniformity in the way in which they have been transcribed,

viz. in the use of capitals, the writing at fuU length of words abbreviated,

and the modernizing the language by the substitution of u for v or i for j,

and vice versa. Titlepages are printed partly in capital and partly in Roman

and italic characters ; and when they are transcribed whoDy in Eoman letters,

there arise several uncertainties. Thus it is usual in the portion printed in

U Vcapitals to replace by and J by I, and very often not to use a larger

letter after a full stop or for a proper name ; and in copying the whole in

Roman letters it is doubtful whether to write these as they are, or to recon-

Wevert them.   are inclined to think that the best plan (except when capitals

are reprinted as capitals &c., in which case no difficulty occurs) is to make an

exact copy, and not even introduce a capital letter after a full stop, although

the author would no doubt have done so himself had he printed his title-

page in Roman characters throughout. Exception must, however, be made

in the case of proper names. These rules have not been followed out com-

pletely in one or two of the earliest titles that we copied, before experience

hsd taught us that in bibliographical matters the greatest attainable accu-

racy should be invariably striven after ; also one or two abbreviations have

been replaced by the words at length (such as e.g. " serenisTM'-' by " sere-

nissimi " or " atq ;" by " atque"). Whejiever, of course, any difference from

ordinary spelling is observed, it may be taken for granted that the title is so

printed in the book                                                                                  the  utmost change that has been made being that some
                                                                                                  ;

words in a few of the titles are modernized.

   The foregoing remarks apply to the titles that are transcribed at length
but a few words must also be said with regard to those in which only
enough is given to identify the books described without possibility of mis-
take. Wherever words are left out from the title, the omission is marked

* Even Babbage makes a bibliographical error on the first page of the preface to his

tables, where he says that " the first 20,000 were read with those in the Trigonoinetria

Artificialis of Briggs." The 'Trigonometria Artificialis' was calculated by Vlacq, and

published by him two years after Briggs's death, though the 20,000 logarithms ap-

pended were of course originally computed by Briggs. Any one who will look at the

title  of the  ' Trigonometria                                                                       Artificialis                                                         in  §5  will  see  how easily a mistake of this kind can
                                                                                                                                                                       '

be made ; and in fact an inspection of the titles of the other works of this period will show

that it would be difficult for any one who had not bestowed some attention on the history

of logarithms to assign them to their true authors. Part of the confusion that exists is
due to Vlacq's excessive modesty, which led him on the titlepages of his works to give

quite a subordinate position to his own name compared with those of Napier and Briggs.
        ON MATHEMATICAL TABLES.           167

by dots, except between place and date, where the publisher's name almost

invariably occurs ; so that, this being understood, the separation by a comma
was considered sufficient. If the work of the Report had to be performed over

again, we should adopt a set of fixed rules with regard to the use of initial

capitals in the printing of words in titles, instead of leaving the matter to

caprice or the printer ; as it is, the treatment in this respect has been fairly

uniform, but might have been better. Such details may seem insignificant ; but

it is desirable that nothing should be regarded as arbitrary. With regard to

the number of pages assigned to books in § 5, there is also a certain want of
uniformitj^: at first we merely looked at the number on the last page, and

(having assured ourselves that the pagination was continuous) regarded that

as the number of pages, ignoring the few pages at the beginning (usually

with a roman pagination) that are devoted to preface &c. ; but afterwards

we included these also. Our object merely was to give an idea of the size

of the work ; so that (except in the cases where the interest of the book was
bibliographical, when we took pains to be quite accurate) it was not thought

necessary always to count pages that were not numbered. Sometimes it

seemed desirable to give the number of pages occupied by the tables instead

of the number in the whole book ; and in a few cases, where the pages were

not numbered, it was not considered worth while to count them, or even give

an estimate. It may be remarked that very frequently (we think we might

say more often than not) the pages on which extensive tabular matter is

printed are not numbered.

   Art. 5. The distinction mentioned in § 2, art. 8, between works that are
and works that are not described in the Report, viz. that the names of the

authors of the former, when the works are referred to, are printed in small

capitals, and of the latter in roman characters, has been adhered to as carefully

as possible ; but it has been found to be very troublesome and unsatisfactory.

We have generally thought it sufficient to print the name in small capitals

only once in a paragraph ; and when there is no risk of mistake (as in the
description of the work in question itself) the name has been printed in

ordinary roman type : the distinction will not be retained in future Reports.

Also, with reference to the meanings to be attached to the words 8vo, 4to,

&c., explained in § 2, art. 9, experience has shown that it is more conve-
nient to use these terms in their technical significations, viz. as defined by

the number of pages to the sheet ; and in future Reports they will be so

used. It should be stated that, except in the case of a few books of no

bibliographical interest, these have been the meanings actually adopted.

Care was taken that this should be so in regard to all works of bibliogra-

phical interest ; and in most other cases the size, as estimated by the eye,

agrees with the technical signification.

   Art. 6. In § 1 it is stated that the Committee had determined to print and
stereotype certain tables of e-' and e"^, and of hyperbolic sines and cosines

which had been commenced by the reporter, and that they were then in the

press.  Only four pages were set tip when the above statement was written
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

and shortly afterwards, when the elliptic functions (referred to further on

in art. 16) were in process of calculation, it became clear that they would

occupy BO much attention that it was not likely that the tables of e^ &c.

could be continued by the reporter till after their completion, and, further,

that the publication of the elliptic functions would tax the resources of the

Committee to such an extent that it was not probable that they would have

the means of printing any thing else, at all events for some time. These

tables were therefore withdrawn ; and the reporter contemplates completing
                                                                                          ;;

168 REPORT-- 1873.

them (very little more remains to be done) after the publication of the

elliptic functions, when they will probably be communicated to one of

the learned societies. The table of powers by the reporter, mentioned in

§ 3, art. 5, is entirely completed, except for the final verification by differ-
ences, which is in progress ; and the printing will be commenced very shortly

but as it is intended to prefix to it a list of constants, with historical notices

of the calculation of each, the publication may be somewhat delayed.

Art. 7. Any one who studies the Keport attentively cannot faU to notice

differences of modes of description in it. These are only verbal, and will be

seen to be unavoidable when it is considered that, as a rule, the account of

each book was written by itself on a separate piece of paper, and that not

till aU had been arranged, and the Report was in print, was it easy to com-

pare the descriptions of the same table occumng in different works, and

therefore written under different circumstances. Very few of these " dis-

crepancies " have been removed, partly because, as each description was cor-

rect, it seemed scarcely worth while to make alterations for the sake of a

fictitious uniformity, and partly because we made it a rule that, a descrip-

tion having been written in the presence of the book, it ought not to be

altered when the book was absent. Slight differences of style and manner

are inevitable in a work the performance of which has extended over the

space of two years, as experience must always continually modify to some

extent both opinions and modes of thought and expression ; of course, if the

work could be done over again with the experience already obtained, the

descriptions would be more uniform.

Art. 8. An objection might be made on the ground that descriptions are given

of some very minor works, which have not even the bibliographical interest

due to age. In answer to this it is to be noted (1) that it is sometimes as

important to know that a book does not contain any thing of value as to know

what is in it if it does, and that the reader alone should be left to decide

what is and what is not valuable ; and (2) that no book is so insignificant

that in the future a correct account of its contents will not be of value.

" The most worthless book of a bygone day is a record worthy of preserva-

tion. Like a telescopic star, its obscurity may render it unavailable for

most purposes ; but it serves, in hands which know how to use it, to deter-

mine the places of more important bodies " (De Morgan, ' Arithmetical

Books,' page ii). Although the primary object of the Report is utility in the

present, still it is not detsirable to entirely forget the wants of the future.

The difficulty the historian of science meets with consists not so much in

getting a sight of the books the existence of which he knows, as in finding

out the names of the second- and third-rate authors of the period he is con-

cerned with. Bibliographies grow more valuable as they increase in age

and it may be predicted with confidence, that long after every vestige of
claim to represent the " state of science " has passed away from this Report,

the list of names in § 5 wiU be consulted as a useful record of nineteenth-

century authors of tables. It might be thought that a less detailed descrip-

tion of unimportant books would sufiice ; but it is only necessary to point

out in reply, that work, unless done thoroughly, had better be left alone.

An account of all the tables in a book is absolute, whereas an account only

of those that seem to the writer worth notice is relative. Want of thorough-

ness is the thing most to be dreaded in all work of a bibliographical, his-

torical, or descriptive nature. It is this want that renders all but valueless

the greater part of seventeenth and eighteenth-centuiy writings of this

class                       and any one who  performs  such work  in  an  incomplete  or  slovenly

manner, merely accumulates obstructions which obscure the truth, and ren-

ders more difficult the task of his successors, who will have to be at the
pains not only of doing the work again de novo, but also of correcting the

errors into which others have fallen through his imperfect accounts.
   Art. 9. With regard to the future Eeport on the subject of general tables

that has been mentioned more than once, and is intended to be supplemen-

tary to the foregoing, it may be stated that a number of additional tables

have already been described and will be included in it ; but the cooperation
of others in the matter is requested. Whether the descriptions in the Sup-
plement will resemble those in this Report will of course depend on the ex-

tent of the former, as, if the number of works described be large, it may be

necessary to practise some curtailment.

   It is requested also that notices of errors detected in the Eeport may be

sent to the reporter (see p. 12).

    Art. 10. Although, as already stated, this Report has no pretensions to

completeness, still any one who notices the non-appearance of names well
known in calculation (such as that of Legendre) is asked to read the con-

clusion of § 1, the list of articles in § 3, and enough of the introductory
matter in § 2 to comprehend clearly the spirit that has directed the selection
of works included, before coming to the conclusion that the omission was not
intentional. Books such as Legendre's ' Ponctions Elliptiques ' and Jacobi's
' Canon Arithmeticus,' though forming separate publications, yet belong more
properly to a later portion of the Committee's work, as they are conclusive,
not subsidiary tables ; the former belongs to Division II., and the latter to

 Division III. (see § 1, p. 4).

    It is perhaps worth noting explicitly, that the word Report has sometimes
been used to denote the whole Report that is contemplated by the Committee,
including 'the accounts of the Integral and Theory-of-Number tables, and
sometimes only the portion of it that will form one year's instalment ; but
the context always shows, without risk of confusion, the meaning to be

 assigned.

    Art. 11. It was originally intended that the list in § 5 should merely con-
 tain the titles of the books described in §§ 3 and 4, with references to the
 section and article where each description was given. But it has been found
 convenient to render it in addition more of an index to the whole Report by
 adding cross references, and also a few titles of papers often referred to, as
 well as references to the places where certain other works or tracts (besides
 books of tables) were noticed. One or two remarks that should have appeared
 in the accounts of the works themselves in §§ 3 and 4 have been added
 after their titles in § 5 (see Babbage, Noeie, 1844, and Napier, 1619, in

   A table of contents is given at the conclusion of this postscript. Whether

 a work of reference ever gets into use or not depends more on the complete-
 ness with which it is indexed than on any thing else.

    Art. 12. The following statistics will not be found without interest. The
 number of separate books of tables described at length in this Report (ex-
 clusive of diiferent editions and of works only noticed incidentally) is 235, of
 which only 5 are derived from second-hand sources. The 230 that have
 thus come under the eye of the reporter are thus distributed among the dif-

 ferent countries :

publication of foreign countries, or, at all events, of the relative proportions in

and as only powers of 2 appear in the denominators, all the decimals ter-

minate, and their accurate values are therefore given. The work was per-

--formed in duplicate one calculation having been made by Mr. W. Barrett

Davis, and the other under the direction of the reporter, by whom the two

were compared, the errors corrected, and the whole differenced. As the

accurate values of the functions were tabulated, the verification by differ-

Aences was absolute.                          short introduction on the use of the tables in inter-

polation was written by Prof. Cayley, who has also made drawings of the

=curves y Y"{x) over the portion calculated.

 --Art. 15. The List of Errors in Vlacq's 'Arithmetica Logarithmica' (1628

or 1631). It seemed very desirable that a complete list of the errata in

Vlacq, 1628 or 1631, should be foi-med for the convenience of those who

have occasion to employ ten -figure logarithms. No less than five copies of

this work have been continually in use in the calculation of the Elliptic

Functions (see next article) during the last year ; and it is tlie ten-figure

table chiefly used. Besides this, the errata in Vlacq are known with more

certainty than are those in Vega, 1794.

   This list had only been partially formed when it was determined to post-
pone the Heport ; and it is believed that the year's delay may possibly result
in its being made more complete. It is proposed to add a list of errata also
in Dodson's ' Antilogarithmic Canon,' 1742 (§ 3, art. 14), and perhaps to

consider the subject of errors in tables generally.

 --Art. 16. The account of the Tahidation of the Elliptic Functions. In Sep-

tember 1872 it was resolved to undertake the systematic tabulation of the
Elliptic Functions (inverse to the Elliptic Integrals), or, more strictly, of
the Jacobian Theta Functions which form their numerators and denomi-

nators.

be so that over each page h shall be constant ; and at the top of each page

and their logarithms, which are likely to be wanted in connexion with tho

Ktables, will be added.  and K' (complete elliptic integrals) were, as is well

known, tabulated by Legendre, and published by him in 1826.

   For the performance of the calculation of and G3 (63 being deduced from
9) 8500 forms were printed and bound up into 15 books (550 in each, with a

few over). Each book, therefore, contains forms for the calculation of six

nineties, viz. from ^·=sin a° (say), x = 0°, to ^ = sin (a°+5°), x = 90°. Similar

forms for the calculation of 0^ and 0^ were priated and bound up into 15

other books.

The work has been in active progress since the beginning of October 1872

and eight computers have been engaged from that time to the present, under

the superintendence of Mr. James Glaisher, F.R.S., aud the Reporter. About
--three quarters of the work is now performed
                                               having been calculated com-

pletely, and its accuracy verified by differences, and 03 being nearly finished

also, while very considerable progress has been made with 0^ and 0.

It is intended that the tables, which wiU be completed, it is hoped, by

February 1874, shall form a separate work, and that they shaU be preceded

--by an introduction, in which aU the members of the Committee wiU take part,
    an account of the application of the functions in mathematics generally

being undertaken by Professor Cayley, of their application in the theory of

numbers by Professor H. J. S. Smith, and of their use in physics by Sir W.

Thomson and Professor Stokes, while the account of the method of calcula-

tion &c. will be written by the Reporter.

The magnitude of the numerical work performed has not often been ex-

ceeded since the original calculation of logarithms by Briggs and Vlacq,

1617-1628 ; and it is believed that the value of the tables wUl be great.

After the circular and logarithmic functions there are no transcendants

more widely used in analysis than the Elliptic Functions ; and the tables will

not only render the subjects in which they occur more complete, but wiU also,

to a great extent, render available for practical purposes a vast and fertile

region of analysis. Apart from their interest and utility in a mathematical

point of view, one of the most valuable uses of numerical tables is that they

connect mathematics and physics, and enable the extension of the former to

bear fruit practically in aiding the advance of the latter.

 --Art. 17. Note on the Centesimal Division of the Degree. In the note

on p. 64 we have expressed an opinion that Briggs and his followers, by

dividing centesimally the old nonagesimal degree, showed a truer appreciation

of how far improvement was practicable, or indeed desirable, than did the
French mathematicians who divided the quadrant centesimally. On reading

Stevinus's ' La Disme,' the celebrated tract in which the invention of decimal

fractions was first announced, we found that the centesimal division of the

degree was there suggested. The following extract from ' La Disme ' is

taken from pp. 156 and 157 of ' La Pratique d'Arithmetique de Simon Stevin

de Bruges ' (Leyden, 1585), near the end of which ' La Disme ' appears in

French. The first publication of the tract, as far as we can find, was in
Dutch, under the title " De Thiende .... Beschreven door Simon Stevin van

Brugghe " (Leyden, 1585).

At the end of the ' Appendice du Traicte des Triangles,' which concludes

the fourth book of the " Cosmographie " in Albert Girard's edition of

Stevinus's collected works, Leyden, 1634 (p. 95), there occurs the following

note :

  --" Notez. J'ay descrit un chapitre contenant la maniere de la fabrique &

le susdit chapitre derriere le traicte d'icelles Planetes, a sgavoir en VAppen-

dice du cours des Planetes."

 --To which is appended the following note by Girard : " Ceste promesse ne

se trouve pas avoir este effectuee."

Steichen, in his ' Memoire sur la vie et les travaux de Simon Stevin

(Brussels, 1846), p. 52, says that Stevinus promises a chapter on the manner
of constructing a table of trigonometrical lines " pour la division de la cir-

conference en parties decimales." This is not correct, as the quotation

from ' La Disme ' shows that Stevinus's idea was to divide the deyree cen-

tesimaUy.

   Briggs, in the ' Trigonometria Britannica' (p. 1), states that he was led to
divide the degree centesimally by the authority of Vieta (" Ego vero adductus

authoritate Vietae, pag. 29. Calendarij Gregoriani, & aliorum hortatu,
Gradus partior decupla rations in partes primarias 100, & harum quamlibet

in partes 10. quarum quselibet secatur eadem ratione. Atque hae partes cal-

Weculum reddunt multo facilorem &{sic), non minus certum ").                           have

looked through ' Francisci Vietse Fontenaeensis .... Relatio Kalendarii vere

only the rectos are numbered, 1 to 40) without finding, either on p. 29 or

elsewhere, any mention of the division of the degree. Without venturing to

say that there is nothing of the kind in the book, it is not unlikely that the

wrong work of Vieta's is referred to, as we have found many other seven-

teenth-century references inaccurate ; and this is rendered more probable
when it is remembered that the ' Trigonometria Britannica ' was published

after Briggs's death.

     But granting, as is likely, that Briggs did derive the idea from Vieta, it is

very probable that the latter himself obtained it from Stevinus, and perhaps

adopted it without acknowledgment, as unfortunately it is to be feared that

   * Stevinus encloses tne exponential numbers in complete circles, for which we have

throughout substituted parentheses, for convenience of printing.
   t This refers to the preceding articles of the ' Disme,' where the decimal division is

explained.
--174 REPORT 1873.

Vieta was bigoted enough to suppress tke name of a heterodox author,

such as in all likelihood Sttivinus was. There can therefore be but little
doubt that the original suggestion for the centesimal division of the degree is

contained in the sentence quoted from ' La Disme ;' but we intend to inves-

tigate the question further, and endeavour to decide it conclusively.

   Observations on the Application of Machinery to the Cutting of

     Coal in Mines. By William Firth, of Birley Wood, Leeds.

      [A Communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso.']

The object of this paper is to submit for consideration some matters toucli-
ing the history of the now more than ever absorbing subject of cutting coal

in mines by mechanical means.
    It is intended to avoid all technical and scientific symbols, and to convey,

in the most simple manner, whatever information is at my command, and to

give, from practical experience, spread over long periods, the results derived
therefrom, and to show that machinery can be, and is now, applied to the
purpose equally to the advantage of the masters and of the men.

   I am aware that there are noiv several distinct modes of doing the work,
and doing it well ; but it is not in my power to give any reliable information

upon the competitive status which the successfid machines hold towards
each other. I shall tlierefore have in this paper to confine myself more
particularly to the introduction of coal-cutting machinery driven by com-

pressed air, and the results obtained from the invention now known as

" Firth's Machine," which was unquestionably the first that ever succeeded

in reducing to actual practice the cutting of coal in mines.
176 REPORT-- 1873.

   When the severe nature of the employment of manual labour for the

" hewing of coal " and the great dangers which beset that occupation are
taken into thoughtful consideration, it is not surprising that much sympathy

should have been always excited in favour of the coal- working class. All

men who have thought upon the subject have felt a strong desire that some
mechanical invention might be made to amehorate the severe conditions

of that occupation.

   The statistics of the comparative longevity of the working classes show
that the duration of the lives of colliers (apart from special accidents) is
lamentably low ; and as respects the " hewers" or "pickmen," whose work is

the most exhausting, they must especially, and in a large degree, contribute
to, and account for, much of that average shortness of hfe.

    The really hard work of a colliery faUs upon the " hewers ; " and the effect

is very often to stamp the men with the mark of their trade, and (through
the constrained position of their daUj' toil) to alter and distort many of the
more delicately formed persons ; and it is due to these men as a class, that

their weaknesses should be mUdly judged, having regard to the scanty oppor-

tunities hitherto afforded to them for intellectual culture, and the unequal

sacrifices which press so heavily upon them in the most valuable and im-

portant branch of all our indusbries.

   In 1862 some experiments were commenced at West Ardsley, by the em-

ployment of compressed air, to devise a cutting-instrument in the form of a

pick. It was to be moved on the face of the coal, strildug in a line and with

such force as would cut a groove deep enough to admit of its being easily

taken out. In the early stages there were many and serious discouraging

symptoms discovered, but on the whole we were well satisfied that they could

Webe overcome by perseverance.  set about to improve the defects, and

battle with the difficulties as they presented themselves ; and after some

years we were in possession of a coal- getting machine, in combination with
air-power, more suitable for the performance of the work which we had
undertaken than we ever anticipated.

   Much surprise has been expressed at our slow progress during the ten
years which have elapsed since the time when we believed that we had
reached success ; but when the peculiar circumstances which surround the

work, and the nature of the work to be done, are taken fairly into account,

the delay need not excite any astonishment. It was in many respects a
new field to be broken up, and accompanied by numerous uncertainties.

It has been more or less so with most of the important inventions which

have gone before it ; indeed the steam-engine, whose origin cannot be
traced back, was known as a prime mover nearly two centuries before it was

sufficiently developed to be recognized as a valuable machine.

  We found, however, that we had to contend against much jirejudice and

resistance. Those who were the most likely to be benefited by it were

either openly hostile or manifested an unfriendly disposition towards the

machine ; and, added to these embarrassments, we failed to obtain any
general encouragement from those who exerted the greatest influence over

the coal-mining interests of the country ; but through the recent deai-ness
of coal, the attention of the country has been drawn to the subject, the

public mind has been powerfully impressed with the necessity for some
improved means of working the mines, and coal-cutting machinery is now

universally looked to as the principal source from which rehef is to come.

   Erom the altered fecHngs of the miners as to the number of hours which
they consider to be sufficient for their labour, and with the new restrictions
             ON COAL-CUTTING MACHINERY.                              177

imposed by the Legislature, there is found already at every colliery in the

country a deficiency of hands to fully man the works now existing ; and coal

has in consequence been scarce and exorbitantly dear. The consumption

goes on increasing ; the continual enlargement of the old iron works, and

the establishment of new ones in new districts, indicate a progressive en-

largement in the demand for coal, unless a general collapse in our foreign

commerce should, through high prices of production, come upon the country.

   New coal-fields, too, are sought after ; and new pits are being opened in

every direction, at enormously increased cost ; and the question naturally

arises, where are the colliers to come from to work them, or how is the in-

creased demand to be reasonably met ?

Labourers from the agricultural districts, and other unskilled workmen,

may, through the influence of high wages, be drawn off to the mines ; but it is
only in " dead work " where they can be immediately made use of, and only

a small proportion make eificient " pickmen."
   By the figures laid before Mr. Ayrton's Committee of the House of Com-

mons (1873), it appears that whilst in 1871 the average production of coal

per man was 313 tons, it had declined to 296 tons per man in 1872. There

had been an increase in the number of persons employed at and about the

mines of 42,184. The disturbance which has been felt in nearly every other

occupation seems to me to be traceable to the heavy drafts which have been
made upon them to supply the increased demand for the coal and iron trades

during the last two years ; and until stagnation and distress in those trades
shall throw back the suffering masses again upon their former employment,

that disturbance must continue, with all its inconveniences.

    A. continuance of the present high price of coal may, and I think will,

make itself felt upon the foreign commerce of this country. I believe, how-

ever, that a decided modification of these evils may be found in the speedy

adoption of coal-cutting machinery.

Other countries are now turning their attention vigorously to the employ-

ment of coal-getting machinery ; and it is not improbable that foreigners will

in this matter take the lead in the employment of an invention purely English.
   In the earlier stages of machine-working, it was contended that the " creep "

of the floors, and the natural disturbances of the strata, would so dislocate

or break the joints of the air-pipes, that continuous working could not be

carried on, the out-put would be intermittent and uncertain, and the cost

of compressing the air would be enormous and overwhelming to the

enterprise.

The coal-owners during many years had had an unprofitable trade, and

they were unwilling to encounter a considerable outlay of new capital in the

work incident to the new system, which, indeed, had not then met with the

approbation of the engineers and mining agents, whUst tlie mining inspectors,

with very few exceptions, were decidedly mistrustful of the success of the

invention. There were others who believed that the heavy work which they

saw done would knock the machines to pieces, and that they could not stand

the test of long-continued service.

Five or six years, however, of regular and daily working of the machines

at Ardsley and elsewhere have effectually negatived these fears.

In the collier class there is a good deal of professional pride or esprit de

corps, especially amongst the older men. There was, and still is, an unwill-

ingness to give up the social dignity which they consider belongs to the

expert wielder of the time-honoured pick ; and some of them have been heard
to declare that they " would adhere to the ancient implement to the end of

1873.                                                             N

their days," and that they would not come down to the humiliating condition,

as they considered it, of " following the machine."
    This feeling on the part of the colliers has hindered the progress of machine-

work more than any other difficulty ; and although it yet prevails to some

extent, the more intelligent and tlie younger men evince a contrary disposi-

tion towards it.

   The leaders of the miners of Yorkshire and other districts have seen the
machines at work, and, whilst they express -without hesitation their un-
qualified approbation of them*, state frankly that their object wiU be to gain
as fuU and fair a share of the advantage of the machines as possible for their

own class. Wow nobody will object to that claim ; and when we come to con-

sider the figures of cost, as we presently shall do, it will be seen that that

claim has not been neglected.
   InteUigence is what is required to manage these machines, rather than

muscular development ; and any youth of ordinary capacity can in a few days
acquii'e sufficient knowledge to do so.

    In 1761, Michael Menzies, of Newcastle, obtained a patent for cutting coal

in mines ; and that is the earliest evidence which we have of any attempt
having been made to produce a mechanical coal-cutter ; and his plans, having

regard to the time at which they were produced, were remarkable for their

ingenuity.

    Menzies's specification is also remarkable in other respects, as showing that
it was his intention to make use of the " Fire Engine " as his motor, which
engine had about two years previously, tkrough the improvements of Watt

and of Smeaton, attained only to so much perfection as to become a doubtful
rival to the " Water Miln," the " Wind Miln," and the " Horse Gin."

   By the power of one or other of these agents, he proposed to give motion
to a heavy iron pick, made to reciprocate by means of spears and chains,
carried down the pit, and with wheels and horizontal spears, on rollers,

extended to the working places, and there to " shear " the coal exactly as it

is now performed. In the same patent Menzies included a " Saw" to cut
the coal ; and although nothing came from his labours, he displayed so much
mechanical knowledge as to have deserved success ; and I am satisfied that

his failure was due to the absence of an eligible power, and not to his defi-

ciencies as a mechanic.

   During the hundred years that followed these events, more than a hundred
other patents were applied for and granted ; but I cannot find, amongst them
all, that there was one machine that approached nearer to success than the
invention of Michael Menzies.

   This fact is not referred to in disparagement of the patentees ; for there were

many curious devices, ingeniously arranged ; but I name the matter to show

1872, from Mr. Philip Casey, of Barnsley, Secretary to the South Yorksliire Miners'

Union.

" Will you allow me to express the gratitude which I feel for the pleasure I derived in

visiting your works yesterday ?

" For many years the name of IVIr. Firth has been known to me in connexion with his

efi'orts to lighten the heavy labour incidental to mining operations ; and the coal-bearing

machine that I saw in operation at the West Ardsley Works altogether exceeded my

expectations.

   " I cannot see how the coal could possibly pay to be got by hand ; its extreme hardness,
coupled with the thinness of the seam, would make it utterly impossible. This machine

is the best friend the collier ever had                                                                                                                                                                                          but  it will Ije our business to  obtain  a full and  fair

that the object excited much contiauous interest, and that amongst so many

miscarriages our mechanics were still hopeful.

   Amongst these devices may be enumerated the " Saw," " Catapult,"

" Battering-Earn," " Plough," " Rotary Wheel," " Endless Chain," " Planing

Machine," and many others.

There had been no  suitable power made      known for diivrng the  machines
                                                                                                        ;

and it was to that cause, in my opinion, that so many failures and disap-

pointments were attributable. The steam engine, even since it attained to

its most perfect form, is in itself insufficient for the purpose, because steam

cannot be produced near to the place where the work has to be done, nor can

it be carried long distances in effective condition, by reason of its rapid con-

densation. Moreover an escape of exhaust-steam could not be permitted in

the coal-mine, because of its tendency to soften and bring down the roof, the

difficulty of maintaining which is already the most serious and troublesome

part of the coal-mining operations.

Hydraulic power might in certain cases be, and has been recently tried

but its unfavourable conditions exceed its advantages for the purpose of

cutting coal in mines, and may be put aside from present consideration.

But in compressed air, so far as the moving power is concerned, every

requirement is found, and from the date of the experiments at West Ardsley,

in 1862, the question was undoubtedly settled.

The elastic property of air under compression is an old and well-known

power ; but until these experiments had been completed, its value was but im-

perfectly understood, and its future beneiicial influence, being dormant, was

imappreciated.

The engine for compressing the air is generally placed on the surface, near

to the top of the shaft ; a receiver is fixed in close proximity thereto ; and the

air is taken from the compressor to the receiver, which is 30 feet in length

and 4 feet in diameter.

The pressure is generally of about three atmospheres.

Iron pipes of sufficient area are laid on from the receiver to the bottom of

the shaft, and there, being spht into smaller sizes, are led in every needed

direction through the roads and passages .of the mine, exactly as the gas and

water services are laid on in our towns.

At the entrance into the working places, a screw joint and stopcock are

fixed to the iron air-pipe, at which point an india-rubber hose, fifty or sixty

yards in length (as the length of the " bank " may require), is screwed on ;
the other end of the hose is attached to the cutting machine ; and when aU is

in readiness, the tap at the receiver is turned on, and the air rushes down,

and throughout the whole service of pipes.

   The air does not require to be forced from the receiver, for by its own
elasticity it is carried forward at a velocity depending on its own pressure.

Apparently it loses none of its power by distance, excepting the frictional

retardation ; and machines are working nearly two miles distant from the

air-engine without any material loss of force.

I have no doubt that if the compressor were stationed in Bradford the

air would travel, and the machines work by it at Ardsley (ten miles; as

satisfactorily as they now do by the engines on the spot.
   In calculating the cost of compressed air, I am satisfied that, although

it is admittedlj' not a cheap power relatively to steam, yet there is no

other available power so cheap or so good for the purpose of cutting coal in

mines ; and I invite attention to the figures on this head which follow, viz. :--

   With well-constructed machineiy, 45 to .50 per cent, of the steam power

exerted will be given off iu compressed air at a pressur* of three atmospheres
iuto the receiver ; and this pressure is sufficient for effectually working our

machiner)''. Some makers of air-engines offer to guarantee a much larger

product ; but I base my calculations upon the smaller yield.

   If the pressure be much higher than three atmospheres, there is a material
increase in the frictional heat disengaged by the act of compression. The
engines do not work wdth the same ease ; and the result of our experience is,
that at 45 to 50 lbs. the maximum point of economy is attained. Calculating

its cost and taking a 40-horse-power boiler to consume 10 lbs. of coal per
hour per horse-power, or 2 tons of engine-coal per day of 11 hours at 8s. per

ton at the pit, we have a cost of 16s. per day.

    It is safe to calculate that this boiler will drive an engine of sufficient power
to supply four coal-cutting machines, being 4s. per day for each machine
and each machine will cut more coal in any given time, and do it in a better
manner, in an ordinaiy seam, than twelve men ; it follows, therefore, that the
equivalent of a man's power exerted for a whole day in cutting coal, can be
obtained, out of compressed air, at a cost in fuel of but 3|cL

   Assuming, then, that this comparison is an accurate one, it may be taken

for granted that the objection to its use, on the score of cost, has no founda-

tion in fact.

   And considering its many and remarkable properties for employment in
coal-mines, it may be useful to dwell briefly on some of those peculiarities.

    It is a power from which, and under no circumstances, can an explosion
happen ; and when an escape from the pipes takes place, it is more or less
beneficial, and not in any wise injurious.

    At every stroke of the piston the air is discharged from the cylinder of the
coal-cutting machine at a temperature of about freezing-point, compressed
into one third of its natural bulk ; and it has been found that the working of
only one machine has had the effect of reducing the temperature at the
working face of the coal to the extent of two degrees Fahrenheit.

    Occasionally ice is formed at the escape valves of the machine, but with-
out producing any inconvenience to their working.

   Now any thing that will reduce the temperature of a mine is an inesti-

mable advantage. It diminishes the risk of explosion ; and by increasing the
velocity of the ventilating current, it renders the occupation of a miner more
tolerable and more healthy.

    In very deep mines the internal heat will probably be found to be so great,
that manual labour of an exhausting character will be unendurable ; but the
discharge of so large a volume of pure air at a pressure of three atmospheres,
and at freezing-point, must exert a powerful and highly favourable influence
under the peculiar circumstances.

   It is well known that the lives which are lost through explosions of gas are
far more numerous from the effect of the damp wliich folloivs the fire, than
from the fire itself ; and in many cases nearly, if not all, the sufferers have

died from this cause.
    There has been no case of fatal explosion within the experience of our

machine w^orkings ; and therefore we have no facts upon which absolute
reliance can be placed ; but we draw the inference, that where coal-cutting
machinery may be in general use in any mine where an explosion of gas does
take place, those who escape from the first effect of the fire will most pro-

bably be saved from death.

    At a lamentable accident in this neighbourhood about two years ago,
when thirty-one lives were lost, twenty- five or twenty-seven of those unfor-

tunate persons died from the effect of the " afterdamp ; " two of the mea
were fortunately saved by a very smaU current of air which was turned upon

them by a brattice cloth, and which supported life until they were released*.
    If the compressed air-pipes had been in those workings at that time, it is

not unreasonable to believe that very few, if anj^, of those twenty-live men

would have succumbed.
    There is another useful purpose incidental to the use of coal-cutting

machinery in mines, which it is worth while to notice ; and that is in the

event of a jnt being on fire.

   At West Ardsley a " blown-out shot " ignited the gas and set fire to the
goaf. It extended to the face of the coal, and had taken strong hold of it,
and the whole pit was in the greatest danger. There is a large water-tank
at the surface for suppljdng the boilers and coke-ovens ; and the manager
promptly connected the air-pipes to the water-tank and turned the water

into the fire.

   In less than an hour the fire was completely extinguished without any

serious damage. On a previous occasion the same colliery was on fire, and
had to be closed up. That fire cost us many thousands of pounds. It hap-

pened before the introduction of the coal-cutting machinery.
    Compressed air is also becomiug extensively used for " hauling," and with

very great advantage. Small engines can be set up wherever convenience

or necessity may require ; they are portable and removable at a trifling

expense, and are available where no other mechanical power for traction
can be obtained.

    It is also valuable for pumping water, and " drilling " the holes where the
coal has to be " blasted," or broken down by the hydraulic press.

   Enough has been said respecting this remarkable and diversified power to
justify the expectation that it is the key to vast and important improvements
upon the present system of working coal ; and bearing in mind that the
wealth, the power, and the greatness of this nation depend primarily upon
an abundant supply of coal, it is hardly possible to overrate the importance

or overvalue the advantage which this power places at our disposal.
   I now turn to the consideration of the machine for cutting the coal, which

has for several years been employed at West Ardsley without any interrup-
tion. [A model and photograph were exhibited to show its form and con-
struction.] The weight is about 15 cwt. for a machine of ordinary size, its
length 4 feet, its height 2 feet 2 inches, and the gauge 1 foot 6 inches to
2 feet ; it is very portable and easily transferred from one benk to another.

    The front and hind wheels of the machine are coupled together in a similar
manner to the coupled locomotive engines. The " pick," or cutter, is double-
headed, whereby the penetrating power is considerably increased.

   The groove is now cut to a depth of 3 feet to 3 feet 6 inches at one course,
whereas by the old form of a single blade we had to pass the machine twice
over the face of the coal to accomplish the same depth. The points are loose
and cottered into the boss ; so that when one is blunted or broken, it can be

replaced in a few moments. This dispenses with the necessity of sending the
heavy tools out of the pit to be sharpened, and is an immense improvement
upon the old pick.

   When all is in readiness for work, the air is admitted and the reciprocating

   * I am informed that at the accident at the Oaks Colliery, near Bai*n8ley, in 1866,

 forty-five persons were found dead in one place, and seventy in another, vfIio were lost for

 want of a little air ; and it is bolieved tliat many more al that time died from the same

 cause.

action commences. It works at a speed of sixty to ninety strokes per minnte,
varying according to the pressure of the condensed air, the hardness of the

strata to be cut, or the expertness of the attendant.

   As to the quantity of work in " long wall," a machine can, under favoui-
ahle circumstances, cut 20 yards in an hour to a depth of 3 feet ; but we
consider 10 yards per hour very good work, or say 60 yards in a shift.

   This is about equal to the day's work of twelve average men ; and the per-

sons employed to work the machine are one man, one youth, and one boy,
who remove and lay down the road and clear away the debris.

    The machines are built so strong that they rarely get out of working con-
dition. Some of those now working at West Ardsley (and other places) have

been in constant use for three or four years.

    At that colliery there are about eight machines in use. One of the seams
is so hard and difficult to manage that it could not be done " by hand,"
and the proprietors had to abandon, and did abandon it ; but now, by the
employment of the machines, it is worked with perfect ease.

    It is a thin cannel seam with layers of ironstone ; and the machines now

" hole " for about 1200 tons per week.
    The groove made by the machine is only 2 to 3 inches wide at the face,

and 1| inch at the back; whereas by bandit is 12 to 18 inches on the
face, and 2 to 3 inches at the back.

    Thus, in thick seams worked by hand, the holing is often done to a depth
of 4 feet 6 inches to 5 feet, and the getter is quite within the hole that he has
made ; and where the coal does not stick well up to the roof, or where there
is a natural parting, there is great difficulty and danger from " falls of coal."

    Referring to a section, it was observed that the angle of tlie cut is such
that, when the upper portion falls off, there is nothing for it but to pitch
forward into the road ; but by machine "holing" with a perfectly horizontal

groove, when the coal falls it simply settles upon its own bed, and has no

tendency to fall forward.

    The cost of applying coal-cutting machinery is an important part of the

question ; but it frequently happens that at old-established collieries there

may be surplus power, which can be utilized; but supposing that everything
has to be provided new, then the following may be taken as an approximate

estimate of the necessary outlay :

2 Boilers at .£500 each                     .£1000^

1 Steam-engine                                1250

10 Machines at ^150 each                                                                                       |

Pipes, receiver, fixing and sundry other 1    1500 > say £5000

                                                     J

    This outlay would provide aU necessary power and plant for the regular
working of eight machines, with two in reserve ; and estimating that each
machine will cut 60 yards per day, the product in a 4-feet seam would be
85 tons per day, or per week say 500 tons per machine ; and 8 by 500 is
4000 tons.

   Now at this rate of expenditure and work done, an allowance of 2c?. per

ton would in three years liquidate the entire outlay.

   But there is no reason why the machines should be restricted to a single

shift daily ; indeed it is far more economical to work double shifts : there is
no additional outlay of capital ; and so far as depends upon the machinery,
the output might be easily increased to 8000 tons per week.

  We now come to the relative costs of cutting the coal by hand and by
          ON COAL-CUTTING xMACHINKRY.                                         183

machine ; and the following figures may be taken as representing a somewhat

favourable state of things for the latter.

   The seam is the " Middleton Main " or " Silkstone bed." The depth of
the mine is 160 yards, and the coal 4 feet thick ; there are two bands of shale,
with a thin layer of coal between them.

   The bottom portion is not always wholly merchantable ; but when it is so,

it yields one ton and a third of a ton per running yard. For the purpose,
however, of this comparison, I take 60 tons only per day (which would come
out of 45 yards of machine working).

   The two boys, it wUl be noticed, are taken as equal to one man ; and for

the purpose of another comparison, I wiU assume that by hand labour
thirty men will produce 60 tons per day, or two tons each, and that by
machine seventeen men will produce the same tonnage. The saving in
number, therefore, would be twelve men to every 60 tons, or upon a colliery
getting 4000 tons per week, the saving would be 132 men.

    I do not wish to press this point further than to say that the cost of

dwellings properly to domicile one half of this number would exceed the first
outlay of capital in furnishing a first-class colliery with first-class machinery
for cutting the coal ; and it must not be forgotten that the equipment of the
hand-cutters in tools forms a considerable item in the first cost of fitting up

a colliery.

admitted ; but they are removed from place to place with little more trouble
than a full corve ; and we have recently made some careful experiments, which
prove that there is in " pillar and staU " about equal advantage as in " long
wall;" and we can confidently assert that the opinions upon the difficulty of
moving them which have been recently enunciated from high quarters are

quite erroneous.

   The items of cost in working contained in the previous account, are con-
fined to the actual working of the two systems, up to the coal being put into
the corves, and ready for being sent out of the pit, all the other work,
whether for hand or machine, being exactly alike.

    But there are some advantages in the machine over the hand-working,
which pertain to the general mine account, viz. the larger size of the coal
brought out, and an increased average price, on sale, with a saving in timber
and other stores.

   I may say in conclusion, that, putting aside entirely all reduction in

the cost of getting out the coal, there are other and collateral considera-

tions which are, myin opinion, sufficiently important and worthy of your

attention,

   I now recapitulate the most prominent points upon which I rely, viz. :

1. Greater safety for the workmen from falls of coal and roof.

2. Less danger of explosion, and greater security against the effect of
       choke damp.

3. Less strain upon the physical powers of the labourers, and great
       amelioration in the hard conditions of their employment, conse-
       quently adding to the comfort and length of their lives.

4. Saving from destruction much of the most valuable of all our com-

         modities.

5. Saving of timber and other materials employed in mining.
6. Increased control over production, enabling sudden demands to be

        suddenly met.
7. Preparing for other important improvements in mining, without any

       addition to the first outlay, such as drilling, hauling, and pumping.
8. The peculiar adaptability of the means set forth for working the very

       deep seams of coal, without which it is very doubtful whether they
        can ever be profitably worked.

9. Greater saving of time in opening new pits, and quickening the

       means of such becoming remunerative.

Considering the vast extent of the trade in coal and the stupendous con-

sequences of a short and insufficient supply, and believing that the speediest

adoption of coal-getting machinery is desirable, I have myself made some

efforts to stimulate that object by an ofi'er of a premium of £500 for the best

machine  that  could  be  produced                                           but  those  efforts have failed, and I  now
                                                                          ;

submit that the question, being of national importance, is one specially

entitled to the support and encouragement of the Government, and that the

British Association is preeminently the channel through which that object

could be obtained in the best manner.

Concluding Report on the Maltese Fossil Elephants.

   By A. Leith Adams, M.B., F.R.S., F.G.S.

It is with mucli pleasure I have to announce to the members of the Asso-

ciation that my labours in connexion with the fossil elephants of Malta havo

been completed.

   It is now thirteen years since these researches were begun ; and although

frequently interrupted by other engagements, the importance of the subject

has all along stimulated me to make every sacrifice within my power in

order to accomplish a work of so much scientific interest. The monograph

descriptive of the elephantine remains discovered by me was read at the con-

cluding meeting of the Zoological Society of London in June last, and will

appear in due course in the Transactions of the Society.

   It is illustrated by a mapand 21 Quarto plates. In mySecondReportinl866,

drawn up immediately after the termination of my explorations, I was dis-

posed towards an opinion that the exuviae I had brought together represented

only one form of Elephant, distinct from any known member of the genus,

and somewhat under the ordinary dimensions of the living species. Subse-

quent examinations, however, showed, in addition, that there were good

indications of the presence of the two dwarf elephants previously determined

by Dr. Falconer and Mr. Busk, from the collection made by Capt. Spratt in the

Zebbug Cave in Malta in the year 1859.

myIst. With reference to the largest species. This is represented in       col-

lections by nearly the entire dentition and many bones of an elephant which

varied in height between 6| and 7 feet. The last figure, however, represents

the maximum proportions as far as I have been enabled to determine from
my own specimens and from all other remains hitherto discovered in the

island. It is apparent, therefore, that the largest Maltese fossil elephant

was, comparatively speaking, a small animal. The dental specimens I have

assigned to this species are very numerous, and for the most part perfect.

They represent every stage of growth, from the first to the last, showing what

appears to me an unbroken series of molars which display the progressive

succession of ridges characteristic of the subgenus Loxodon, and are therefore

allied to the existing African elephant, from which, however, they differ not

only in relative dimensions, but also in well-marked specific characters.

The ridge-formulae of the deciduous and true molars of this species seem

to me to stand thus * :

           Milk-Molars.                                 True Molars.

X 3 x: X 6 X : X 8-9 X : :              x 8-9 x : x 10 x : x 12-13 x.

   From these figures it will be apparent that the nearest alliance as regards
the ridge-formula would be to the gigantic Loxodon meridionalis, whilst the
crown sculpturing of the molars resemble the same in Elephas antiquus ; but

they do not agree in further particulars with other species excepting the

Elephas melitensis, to which I will refer presently. With reference to the
skeleton generally, the majority of the characters of the long bones are more

in keeping with the African than the Asiatic elephant.
   The presence of this larger species of elephant, in conjunction with the

dwarf forms, was pointed out by Dr. Falconer, and subsequently by Mr.
Busk ; but their specimens were much too fragmentary to allow of specific
determination, a want, however, which is amply supplied by the materials
collected by me.

                                                             * X stands for talons.

186 HEPORT--1873.

   In the choice of a name for this proboscidian I have been prompted by
considerations purely incidental, inasmuch as the gap or rock-fissure from
which I obtained the most perfect specimens of its teeth and bones is situ-

ated in the immediate vicinity of a remarkable megalithic structure supposed

to have been built during the Phoenician occupation of the Maltese Islands.

I have accordingly named this new species the Eleplias mnaidriensis.
   2nd. The dwarf species named Elej;>has melitensis by Falconer and Busk is

well shown in my collection by many important bones, besides what appears
to me to be the entire dental series. This species seems to have varied con-

siderably in size ; indeed it would appear to link the two extremes represented
by the Elephas mnaidriensis and the smallest form, Elephas Falconer i. The

majority of the bones indicate, however, that its average height may

have been nearly 5 feet, as previously estimated by Dr. Falconer and Mr.
Busk, from the Zebbug collection. The dentition of Elejjhas melitensis, as
determined by Falconer, receives ample confirmation from the data furnished

by my collections, the ridge formula being :

         Milk Molars.                  True Molars.

X 3 X : X 5 X : X 8 X.  x 8-9 x : x 9-10 x : x 12 x.

   The only discrepancy between our estimates is an additional ridge in the

penultimate true molar of my specimens, which it may be observed is not a

rare occurrence in the equivalent tooth of the African elephant. It is clear

therefore that, like the larger form, the above belonged to the Loxodon

group, with a ridge-formula almost identical to that of E. mnaidriensis, ex-

--cepting in the penultimate milk-molar, which in the former holds 5 instead

of 6 plates, besides talons a distinction maintained in various specimens in

my collection.

   The crown-patterns of worn molars in the two elephants are also very much

alike ; but the relative dimensions of teeth of equivalent stages of growth
differ a great deal, indeed more so than perhaps in large and small indivi-

duals of any known species.
   Again, we find thick- and thin-plated varieties among the last true molars

of both forms, just as obtains in other species ; so that, taken in conjunction

with the bones, it seems to me that they cannot be reconciled with sexual

or individual peculiarities of one species of elephant.

   3rd. The smallest adult bones in my collection represent a very diminu-

tive elephant. In some instances, as compared with other species, there are
evidences of individuals even under 3 feet in height. With reference to
dental materials, there is some variety in dimensions of molars ascribable to
the Elephas melitensis ; but, allowing a fair margin in this respect, and taking

into consideration their absolute similarity in every other particular, it seems

to me impossible to make out a third species from the teeth alone. There

are, however, vertebrae and other bones which fairly establish the pigmy
proportions of the Elephas Falconeri of Busk ; at the same time there is no
difficulty in arranging a graduated series of specimens, from the smallest up

to the largest bones ascribable to the Elephas melitensis.
   But whilst the differences in size between the two dwarf forms are not so

great as usually obtains between large and small individuals of living species,
there is a remarkable dissimilarity in this respect between the lai'gest specimens
representing the Elephas mnaidriensis and the smallest of Elephas Falconeri

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

indeed the estimated height of the former shows an elephant nearly three

times as tall as the latter, thus displaying a range much exceeding any
known instances of individual variation among recent and extinct species.
ON MALTESE FOSSIL ELEPHANTS.  187

I am thus particular to record these facts in order to show what appears to
me evidence that the dwarf forms were not females or small individuals of

Elejjhas mnaidriensis, although the latter was, comparatively speaking, a small

species, and agreed, at all events, with Elephas melitensis in many important

particulars. Unless, therefore, a far greater variability of species existed in

those times than at present, after making every allowance for size and other

characters, I see no avoiding the inference the materials force on us, viz.

that there lived in the Maltese area two, if not three, distinct species of

elephants diiferent from any known forms. It is necessary to say a few
words with reference to their associated fossil fauna. In the first place, all
the elephantine forms have been found in the same deposits, and usually in-
termingled. Along with them we find bones and teeth referable to the Hi])-
popotamus Pentlandi and H. minutus. The former has been met with in great
abundance in the island, whilst only a few teeth and other portions of the
skeleton of the latter have turned iip. Here again we observe a great varia-
bility in dimensions ; indeed in this respect these two riverhorses resemble
the large and pigmy forms of the elephants ; and although the former have
been found in a fossil state in Sicily and Crete in conjunction with other
mammals, this is not the case with the giant dormice and large extinct swan,
which have hitherto tvirned up nowhere out of Malta. I may state that the
Reptilian remains found by Admiral Spratt and myself in union with these
quadrupeds and birds have not, as a whole, been critically examined ; but, in
consideration of the importance of the subject, 1 am in hopes of seeing this

accomplished soon.

    The moUusca found in connexion with foregoing represent several recent

species, which have been already noticed in my first Eeport for 1865.

    It must be apparent, therefore, that this (for the most part) unique fossil
fauna, restricted to a small mid-ocean island, presents several interesting
contrasts with reference to the Mammalia in general, and elephants in par-
ticular, which frequented Europe during late geological epochs. Eor example,

between Eome and Sicily we find remains of the Elephasjjrimigenius, Elephas

antiqims, and Elephas meridionalis. In the caves of Sicily traces of the
African elephant have been discovered, and also molars, barely distinguish-

able from those of the Asiatic species, and which, under the name of Elephas

armeniacus, are traceable eastward into Asia Minor, in the direction of the
 present habitat of the living species. It looks, indeed, as if the eastern

basin of the Mediterranean had been at one time a common ground where aU

these extinct and living elephants met, and whence, with other animals,
they have disappeared or been repelled to distant regions.

    In fine the importance of late discoveries in this area, and the circumstance
that the explorations have been hitherto restricted to isolated points along

the shores and islands of the great inland sea, promise weU for future re-

searches ; indeed I might be permitted to say that if one quarter of the super-
fluous zeal and energy of the rising generation of English geologists were
directed towards the ossiferous deposits of Southern Europe and JSTorthern

Africa, we should not have long to wait for novelties equally interesting with

 any yet produced.

   In conclusion, I beg once more to express my deep obligations to the

 British Association for the valued assistance extended to me not only during

 the prosecution of the explorations, biit also with reference to the illustration

of the various and interesting materials I have described at length in my

 memoir, of which this is but a brief abstract.

--188 REPORT 1873.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Ramsay, Professor
   Geikie, Professor J. Young, Professor Nicol, Dr. Bryce, Dr.

   Arthur Mitchell, Professor Hull, Sir B,. Griffith, Bart., Dr.

   King, Professor Harkness, Mr. Prestwich, Mr. Hughes, Rev.

  H. W. Crosskey, Mr. W. Jolly, Mr. D. Milne-Holme, and Mr.

   Pengelly, appointed for the purpose of ascertaining the existence
   in different parts of the United Kingdom of any Erratic Blocks or

   Boulders, of indicating on Maps their position and height above the

    sea, as also of ascertaining the nature of the rocks composing these

   blocks, their size, shape, and other particulars of interest, and of

    endeavouring to prevent the destruction of such blocks as in the opi-

   nion of the Committee are worthy of being preserved. Drawn up by
   the Rev. H. W. Crosskey, Secretary.

The Royal Society of Edinburgh has appointed a Committee for the special

examination and description of Boulder or Erratic Blocks in Scotland ; and it
wiU therefore not be necessary for this Committee to include Scotland in its

investigations.

   Throughout England and Wales boulders and groups of boulders are
scattered, among which the work of destruction is constantly going on.
Groups of boulders are removed from the fields and built into waUs ; krge
boulders are frequently blasted ; and during these operations the signs of ice-
action are either rendered obscure or entirely removed.

   The geological importance, however, of obtaining the exact facts respecting
the distribution of travelled boulders is increasing with an extended knowledge
of the very complicated character of the phenomena of the glacial epoch. The

dispersion of boulders cannot be traced to one sbvjJe period of that great epoch.

   Prof. Ramsay has pointed out that transported blocks have travelled in
some instances over land higher than the parent beds from which they

have been derived, thus affording support to the theory that oscillations of
the land took place during the one great glacial period, which would neces-
sai'ily be accompanied by a scries of dispersions of boulders*.

   The distances of the boulders from the rocks from which they were de-
rived, the heights over which they have passed and at which they are found,
the matrix (if any) in which they are imbedded, whether of loose sand,
gravel, or clay, will form elements in determining at what period in the gla-

cial epoch their distribution took place.

    As the dispersion of boulders cannot be traced to one single period,

neither can it be referred to one single cause.

    The agency of land-ice, the direction in which icebergs would float during
the depression of the land, the power of rivers in flood to bring down
masses of floating ice, must be taken into account.

    It will not be the office of this Committee to oifer theoretical explanations,
but to coUect facts, although the bearing of these facts upon debatable geo-

logical problems may from time to time be not unjustly indicated.

    WTiile the dispersion of boulders can neither be traced to one single
period nor referred to one single cause, in some cases boulders distributed at

different periods and by different causes may have become intermixed. This

possibility, of course, largely adds to the complexity of the problems in-
volved, and to the difficulty of assigning to various isolated boulders and
groups of boulders their definite place in a great series of phenomena.

    The following circular has been distributed by the Boulder Committee of
the Royal Society of Edinburgh :

 190 REPORT--1873.

     It is proposed by the Committee to issue a similar circular, with some
 modifications, to Secretaries of Field-clubs and local Geological Societies in

 England and Wales, and others who may be willing to assist in their work.

     The Committee would especially in^-ite the cooperation of the various
 field-clubs of England and Wales, whose members, in their various excur-
 sions, enjoy singular opportunities of becoming acquainted with the boulders

  of the country.

                                    Chaenwood-Forest Bouldeks.

     The railway-cutting at Hugglescote, approaching Bardon Hill, passes
 through an immense number of striated and polished boulders. Mr. Plant,
 of Leicester (who has investigated the boulders of this district, and furnished
 us with considerable information), describes this cutting at Hugglescote as
 30 feet deep. The diift-gravel is a hard cemented mass, with hundreds of
 erratics, at all heights, sticking not on their longer faces, but sometimes on end,
 distinctly proving that the ice melted in situ, and left the materials to find
 their own bearings. One, of which he saw the fragments, had to be blasted
 to get it out, and was estimated by the engineer to weigh 10 tons.

     All the boulders (except one, a peculiar millstone-grit) were derived from
 the Charnwood-Forest range, the most travelled from a distance of 30 miles,
 the nearest about 2 miles.

    Some of the boulders were upwards of 5 tons in weight, and were striated

 and polished frequently on more than one side. Many were angular and

 subangular. They were very irregularly dispersed through an unstratified
 matrix of sand and clay.

    The whole distance from the vast accumulation in the cutting to Bardon
Hill, the nearest point of Charnwood, a distance of about 2 miles, is covered
with trails of boulders.

    The jagged edges of the Bardon-Hill rock, 854 feet above the sea-level,
indicate the way in which boulders would be broken off, supposing the hill
itself covered with ice.

    During some part of the glacial epoch Charnwood Forest was evidently a
centre from which highly glaciated boulders were distributed.

    Mr. Plant reports that a great south front of igneous rock has been broken

down and distributed, east, south, and south-west, 10, 15, and 20 miles, in

direct lines.

   An area of 10 miles N.N.W. and 20 miles S.S.E. and S.W., is covered

with boulders derived from Charnwood Forest, fi-om 2 cwt. up to 10 tons.
    Centuries of cultivation (he adds) have been occupied more or less in clear-

ing the surface of these boulders. They are still found in great numbers, 2
to 3 feet deep ; but the surface-boulders are found in the walls of village
houses, churches, farm-houses, and other old structures, all over the county.

    Four large blocks from the railway-cutting at Hugglescote have been
removed, and placed in the grounds of the Leicester Museum. One of these

--is a fine example of a polished rock, and is full of ice-grooves. Its dimen-

sions are : 6 ft. high, 3 ft. 2 in. broad (or thick), 3 ft. wide ; weight nearly
4 tons. It consists of "porphyritic greenstone" from Charnwood Forest, grey
felspathic base (dolerite), with crystals (| to f on face) of quartz. Through
long chemical action in the drift the felspar has been decomposed, aud left
the crystals standing out all over the surface, except on the polished side.
The other three blocks are neai'lj- of the same size and composition.

   It is intended to remove other blocks to the museum-grounds for preser-

vation.

                                         357 feet above the sea.

   At the base of Ketley gravel-pit, near "Wellington (Shropshire), is a bed
of very fine sand, containing a remarkable group of large angular and sub-

angular boulders.

   The sands and gravels extend to heights of from 25 to 30 feet, and yielded
13 species of raollusca, chiefly in fragments.

   It wiU be observed that only one of these species is extinct in British

waters, viz. Astarte borealis.

   Throughout the sands and gravels waterworn pebbles are found, with
occasional masses of larger size, composed of the same material as the larger

boulders beneath.

   Beneath the marine sands and gravels some of the boulders are 8 feet by
5 feet, and theii- sides are planed very smoothly, and they have a subangular

shape.

    Out of 100 specimens, 80 per cent, consist of Permian sandstones from
the immediate neighbourhood.

   From the immediate neighbourhood also there are boulders of

Eocks of Charnwood Forest, from a distance of 50 miles.

    One remarkable feature of this group of boulders is the intermixture of
boulders from the neighbourhood with those that have travelled from different
points of the compass, the whole group being buried beneath marine sands and
gravels, at the elevation of about 300 feet above the sea.. The elevation of

Ketley village is 357-319 feet above the sea.
    For the boulders of the neighbouring drift of the Severn valleys reference

may be made to an exhaustive paper by Mr. G. Maw (Quart. Journ. Geol.

Soc. vol. XX. p. 130).

    The Geological Section of the Birmingham Natiu-al-History Society has
commenced a systematic examination of the boulders of the Midland district,

and has favoured the Committee with the following preliminary lleport :

   " The Ordnance Map of the neighbourhood of Birmingham has in the first

 place been divided by ruled lines into squares of one inch side, each square
enclosing a representation of one square mile of country. Enlarged maps, on
the scale of six inches to the mile, were prepared from this ; and on these
enlarged maps the boulders were to be marked by circles, the number of
 concentric circles representing the diameter of the boulder in feet. For col-
 lecting specimens of the rocks of which the boulders are composed, bags were

made, and numbered corresponding to each square on the map ; at the same
 time notes were to be made of any specimen that was of unusual interest.

192 REPORT--1873.

Finally, it was proposed to represent, on a duplicate map, the number, of
boulders and character of the rocks by disks of colour, so that a graphic re-
presentation of the boulders, as to position, numbers, and kind of rock, would
be given, and the source of any class of boulders (as granite e. g.) could be
readily traced. It was further proposed to number a rough rehef-map of the
district, so as to judge in what way the configuration of the country had

affected the distribution of the boulders.

    " Considerable information has been already obtained, of which the follow-

--ing is a summary :

  A·' difficulty was experienced in defining the term boulder ; and, after

-- Amuch discussion, it was thought that for the district the following definition

would serve : ' boulder is a mass of rock which has been transported by
natural agencies from its native bed.' Respecting the size at which a rock

may be called a boulder, it is thought better not to assign any very definite
limit. Some specimens, measuiing not more than a foot in some one direc-

tion, are both transported from great distances and glaciated, and fairly fall

--into the categorj' of boulders.
   " Distribution of the Boulders. The district has not as yet been sufficiently
examined to report fully on this question. There are unquestionably some
places where great accumulations have taken place, separated by country
with only a few boulders per square mile. The places where large accumu-

lations (a thousand or so) occur, as far as has yet been ascertained, are :

         1. Tettenhall.                                         2. Bushbury.            3. Cannock.

Places where moderate accumulations (50 to 100 or 200 per square mile)

occur :

                                                   Penkridge.                 Stone.

" The southernmost point where boulders have been observed is on the left

of the lane leading from Bromsgrove Station to the town, the most eastern

at Bugeley, where only two or three occur.

" It has been suggested that the cause of accumulations of boulders is due

to the stranding of an iceberg at the place in question ; but at present there

is not sufficient evidence to form any satisfactory opinion as to the cause of

the accumulation.

" The boulders of the Midland district seem originally to have been im-

bedded either in clay or drift-sand ; but it is quite the exception to find them

in situ. They seem commonly to be disturbed bj- farmers in the district, who

meet with them when ploughing. If the boulder be of manageable size, it

is at once dug up and turned into the nearest ditch, or sometimes is buried,

or, it may be, carried to the road-side, and broken up for road-purposes.

Farmers find some of the boulders useful as horse-blocks, or for protecting

gate-posts or the corners of v/aUs and buildings ; and it is thus that many

are preserved. If the boulder be a very large one, it is generally left in the

ground, and the plough carried on each side of it. Since a plough may pass
over a boulder several times before the men will take the trouble to remove

the obstruction, there is eveiy chance for the boulder to become marked by

striations                                         and hence much care is required in forming a judgment as to the

origin of striae which may be found upon it. It should be mentioned here

that boulders gradually 'work up' to the surface. This is due no doubt to
ON ERRATIC CLOCKS OR BOULDERS.  193

the denudation which is taking place. In a field near Red-Hill Farm, be-
tween btafFord and Stone, is one of the largest boidders of the district. This

boulder was not noticed until some twenty years ago, when it was found to
obstruct the plough, although still some depth underground. The obstruc-

tion became more and more serious each year, until a few years ago, when,
because of this impediment, the field was turned from an arable to a grazing
one. At this time the boulder rises about one foot above the level of the
field. The part exposed measures 6 feet by about 5, and evidently extends
under the turf for a much greater distance. This boulder is composed of

the grey granite of which so many other boulders in the neighbourhood

consist.

   " The boulders consist mainly of white granite and of felstone ; but many
other rocks occur, as may be seen by inspecting the specimens collected. In

the neighbourhood of Tettenhall there is a large percentage of granite boul-
ders ; but south of here there are very few indeed, the boulders being mainly
of felstone. In the Harborne district only one granite boulder has been
observed, while there are a hundred or so boulders of other rocks. The
contrast between the immense accumulation of granite boulders in the
Wolverhampton district and their comparatively small size and rarity around
Birmingham is most remarkable."

           Granite Boulder on the shore of Barnstaple Bay, North Devon,

    Mr. Pengelly reports the following particulars respecting this boulder,
upon which the raised beach on the northern side of Barnstaple Bay rests.

   So far as it is visible, it measures 7'5 x 6 x 3 ft., and therefore, containing

upwards of 135 cubic feet, cannot weigh less than 10 tons.
    It appeal's to have been first described by the late Eev. D. Williams, in

1837, as " flesh-coloured, like much of the Grampian granite " and, in his

opinion, " neither Lundy, Dartmoor, nor Cornish granite."
    In 1866 Mr. Spence Bate, believing that very similar granite existed in

Cornwall, expressed the opinion that it was not necessary to go so far as
Aberdeen, but that some transporting power must have been required to
bring it even from the nearest granite district, and that it without doubt
occupied its present position before the deposition of the beach resting
upon it.

    Recently Mr. Pengelly has been informed that red granite occurs on

Dartmoor, and therefore has no disinclination to say, with Mr. Bate, that we

need not go as far as Aberdeen to find the source of the boulder, although it

nevertheless may have come from the Grampians.
   Assuming that the block may have come from Lundy, twenty miles towards

the west, or down the valley of the Torridge from the nearest point of Dart-
moor, thirty miles off as the crow flies, its transport in either case must have
been due to more powerful agencies than any now in operation in the same
district. Between Barnstaple Bay and Lundy there are upwards of 20 fathoms
of water, a depth at which no wave that ever entered the Bristol Channel
would probably ever move the finest sand.

   Again, as the highest part of Dartmoor is but 2050 ft. above mean tide,
a straight line from it to where the boulder now Hes would have a fall of
1 in 77 only, down which the Dartmoor floods would certainly not transport
a rock upwards of 10 tons in weight.

    The foregoing considerations apply, of course, with at least equal force to
the hypothesis of any more distant derivation.

    That such a block might have been brought from Dartmoor down the Tor-

ridge to the place it now occupies, had the actual heights been the same as
now and the climate as cold as that of Canada at present, wiU be ob-

vious to every one conversant with that country. It is only necessary to
suppose that the block fell from a cliff into a stream where the water was at

least sometimes of sufficient depth that when frozen round the mass the latter
would be lifted by the buoyancy of the ice. On the breaking up of the ice
the floods would transport the rock so long and so far as its ice-buoy was
capable of supporting it ; and though the distance accomplished in a single
journey might, and probably would, be inconsiderable, by a repetition of the
process season after season it would become equal to any assigned amount.
Blocks of great size have been in this way transported in Canadian rivers for
100 miles or more. Again, were Lundy Island capable of generating a
glacier and launching it into the sea as an iceberg, there would be no diffi-
culty in supposing that any number of boulders might be transported thence

to the mainland of Devon.

    In short, whether the boulder came from Dartmoor or Lundy or any more
distant source, it must have been transported by ice-action ; and hence its
presence where it now lies is good evidence of a cUmate in this country much
colder than that which at present obtains.

   From the foregoing considerations it will be seen that, if the mass were

ice-borne, the land could not have been higher above the sea during the era
of the boulder than it is at present. There is nothing, however, to prevent

its being lower. The boulder may have been dropped by an iceberg on or
near the spot it now occiipies when that spot was covered with deep water.
The only stipulation to be made on this point is, that the land which
fuirnished the mass was capable of supplying it with an ice-body.

For example, if the boulder was derived from Dartmoor, Devonshire as a
whole could not have been any thing like 2050ft. lower than at present; for
that would have been to submerge the entire country, whereas there must
have been subacrial land sufficient to form the ice-raft whose buoyancy

 floated the boulder.

    It is hoped that the steps proposed to be taken by the Committee will
 enable the boulders of one or two districts at least to be systematically
 mapped, and the existence of other such remarkable boulders as the granite

boulder on the shore of Barnstaple Bay to be recorded. Any attempt at

 systematic classification, however, must necessarily be deferred until the facts
 are more largely accumulated.

 Fourth Report on Earthquakes in Scotland, drawn up by Dr. Bryce,

  F.G.S. The Committee consists of Dr. Bryce, F.G.S., Sir W.

     Thomson, F.R.S., Geo. Forbes, F.R.S.E., and Mr. J. Brough.

 The conjecture hazarded in last Report, that " the state of quiescence
 therein referred to was " not likely to continue," received a speedy fulfil-
 ment. In a postscript to the Report, which was not, however, forwarded
  in time to be read at the Meeting, it was noticed that " while the Associ-

--Atook place in the south of Scotland. Of these an account has now to be
given.  few days after the occurrence of the earthquake, the Member of

Committee resident at Comrie communicated with me ; and having seen in

the newsjiapers notices of other places where the earthquake had been felt,

I entered into correspondence with gentlemen in the various districts. In

the end of September I visited several of these districts, and made inquiries

in person. From the facts thus made known to me the following account
has been drawn up ; but before proceeding with it, I have to express my

obligations to the following gentlemen for the kind manner in which they

complied with my request, and communicated at once all the observa-
tions made by themselves, and facts collected from others on whom they

--could depend : Dr. Campbell and Eev. James Muir, Bridge of Allan ; Eev.

"William Blair, Dunblane ; Mr. J. Stirling Home-Drummond, of Ardoch,

Braco ; Dr. William Bryce and Mr. David Cousin, both from Edinburgh, the

former happening to be at Crieff at the time, and the latter at Bridge of

Allan ; Mr. P. Macfarlane and Mr. J. Brough, Comrie ; Sir David Dundas,
of Dunira, Comrie ; and llev. J. E. H. Thomson, B.D., Blair Logie. Dr.
Campbell's evidence is especially valuable, as he resided for some time in

Upper Strathearn, where earthquakes are of frequent occurrence and were

often experienced by him, and as he is in the constant practice of accurate

every-day observations of meteorological instruments for a register kept by

him at the usual hours. Mr. Macfarlane and Mr. Brough at Comrie possess,

of course, like advantages. Mr. Cousin also had the advantage of previous

experience in observations of this kind, an earthquake having occurred while

Ahe was resident in Algeria.  similar advantage was enjoyed by the Eev.

J. E. H. Thomson ; at the instant when the shock occurred he was in con-

versation in his own house with two ladies, one of whom had resided for

some years in Valparaiso, where earthquakes are of very common occurrence,

as is well known.

The earthquake took place on the 8th of August, 1872, at from 8TM to 10"

past 4 o'clock in the afternoon. The day was warm and perfectly still. In

the early part of the day there had been alternations of a cloudy and clear

sky ; but at the hour mentioned only the western part of the horizon showed

cloudy masses, the sky overhead and eastwards was free from cloud of any

kind. The barometer rose slightly during the day, from 29-800 at 10 a.m.

to 29-975 at 10 p.m. The maximum temperature of the day, in the shade,

was 64°-3 F. ; the minimum temperature of the night preceding was 53°-8 F.,
of the night following 51° F. No perceptible change in the temperature or

character of the atmosphere as to wind and cloud took place after the shock.

 --The successive phases, according to almost all the observers, were :

noise or sound, loud, heavy and rumbling; a shock with a shaking and

rattling of objects ; and a wave-like motion of the ground. The noise or

sound is compared to the sound of thunder, to that made by a, heavy waggon

on a stony street, to the emptying of a cart of small stones or rubbish, to

the noise one hears when under a bridge over which a heavy train is pass-

ing. Many who were within doors supposed that a heavj^ piece of furniture

had fallen on the floor of an adjoining room. A clergyman was standing on

the hearthrug in his study, and, hearing a sudden noise or crash, imagined a

chimney-stack was falling, and rushed instantly into a position of safety.

Finding this surmise incorrect, he referred the noise to the faU of a ward-

robe in the next room. This surmise also proving incorrect, he went imme-

diately down stairs and found his servants panic-stricken. In the nursery

the nurse had i-ushcd to the window and screamed in alarm to her mistress,

                                                                           o2

who was in the garden. So strong, indeed, and concurrent is the evidence

on this point that no doubt can remain about it, in regard to almost all the

localities from which communications have been received ; the slight discre-

pancy among the witnesses to the fact may be accounted for by some of

them being resident on a soil composed of soft alluvium, and others upon a

rocky surface. Some of the witnesses notice that the sound was instanta-

neously repeated with even greater violence.

   The shock instantly followed the noise or sound ; and its occurrence was
marked in many ways : houses were shaken, doors and windows made to

rattle, suspended objects to oscillate ; in one house bells were set a-ringing

with  violence,  in  another  they  were  strongly  agitated                                jugs,  basins,  and
                                                                                         ;

water-glasses in bedrooms, apothecaries' bottles, phials, and pots, the glasses

in the pump-room at Bridge of AUan Spa were heard to knock against one

another and seen to move ; a chimney-mirror, loosely fastened, was thrown

down ; and chimney ornaments were dashed upon the floor.

Next succeeded that most appalling of all the attendant circumstances of

an earthquake, the sensation as of a heaving impulse or wave, giving the

idea of a crest and declivity, instantly followed by a double vibration, the

whole duration being from three to four seconds. The statements of the ob-

servers (as made known in the various reports) on whom one feels that most

reliance is to be placed from their previous expei'ience, habits of close ob-

servation, and the circumstances in which they were placed at the time,

all go to show that the undulation came from a direction W. or N.W., some

observers making the direction exactly opposite by not distinguishing the

first impulse from the recoil or restoration of the wave-surface. One ob-

server, on whom the utmost reliance can be placed, had the most distinct

feeling of vertigo or dizziness arising from the undulation, a sensation so

strong that a few moments' continuance of it would have produced nausea

a strong testimony to the reahty of the wave-motion.

The extent of country throughout which this earthquake was felt is

greater than that of any which has occurred since this inquiry was under-

taken. The limits are marked by Stirling and Blair Logic on the S.E., and

St. Fillans on Loch Earn and Glen Lednock on the N.W. The shock was

feebler at these limits than in the parts intermediate, as Bridge of Allan,

Dunblane, Greenloaning, Ardoch, and Crieff. In regard to the breadth of

country agitated, I have been unable to determine that it extended more

than two or three miles from the vaUey of the Allan Water, the concussions

recorded being greater to the east of that valley than in the opposite direc-

tion, while in the village of Doune, four miles west, they do not seem to

have been noticed. The want of self-recording instruments, the extreme

difficulty of determining the exact instant of the occurrence of an event so

sudden and startling, render it impossible to attempt any definite statement

as to the progress of the wave, which, so far as instrumental indication can

serve us, seems to have emanated from near Comrie. All the observers who

have attempted to specify an exact time have, to aU appearance quite inde-

pendently, agreed that it was, as above stated, at 10" past 4'' p.m. Persons

trained to observe, or self-recording instruments, alone can furnish reliable

data in such a case for indicating the time occupied in the undulation pass-

ing from point to point. The intensity upon the Comrie scale, which ranges

from 1 to 10, was of a medium force, about 4.
   The geological formation of the tract of country embraced wdthin the

above limits varies greatly. The lower part of the village of Bridge of Allan

is situated upon the alluvium of the I'orth valley, in which, as far up from
ON EARTHQUAKES IN SCOTLAND.                      197

the present channel of the river as the streets of the lower part of the

village, skeletons of whales have been found. The upper or northern part

of the village stands upon a high terrace of Old Eed Sandstone, traversed by

whin dykes, alongside one of which its famous Spa is discharged. The front

of this terrace runs east and west, and forms the former sea-margin, hewed

out by the waves of the old estuary, against which the alluvium rests to an

unknown depth. The town of Stirhng stands upon the south side of the

Forth valley, partly on alluvium and partly on a trap ridge erupted through

Old Eed Sandstone. Eastwards from Bridge of Allan by Blair Logic and

Dollar, the Ochill HiUs, of which the terrace at Bridge of Allan is the first

ridge or step, are composed of the same Old Sandstone, broken through and

overlain by a vast body of trap rocks, clay-stones, and porphyries, and pre-

sent a waU-like front to the Forth valley on the south. They completely cut

off the Coal-measures, tilting up the strata at a high angle, altering the coal

to the state of coke, shale to Lydian stone, and sandstone to quartzite.

Dunblane, Greenloaning and Ardoch, and the wild moorlands N.W. to

Crieff' are composed of Old Red Sandstone pervaded by traps ; and Crieff and
Comrie are close upon the junction of the sandstone and old slates of the

mountain-region. Glen Lednock and a large area E. of it towards Crieff are

occupied by an eruptive granite which sends veins into the slate, and whose

outer edge approaches close to the boundary of the slate and sandstone.

--Whatever the cause of this earthquake may have been masses of rock fall-

ing from the roof of a vast cavern, or a sudden impact of high-pressure

--steam emanating from the nether depths all the strata were affected by it,

and sent the awful tremor, yet with varying intensity, alike along beds of

rock and alluvial strata.

The particulars in regard to the earthquake in the south of Scotland have

been kindly supplied by Dr. Grierson and Mr. Henrison, Thornhill, Dum-

fries, and Mr. J. Shaw, Tyrnon parish. The earthquake took place on the

A16th of April, 1873, at 9^ 55"" p.m.  smart concussion, producing a con-

siderable sound, noise, or crash, as it is variously described, and causing a

perceptible movement in fixed objects, and an oscillation of those suspended,

was experienced in the parishes of Tyrnon, Glen Cairn, Keir, Penpont, Mor-

ton, Closeburn, and Balmaclelland. Doors and windows were made to

rattle ; there was a sensible vibration of walls and floors in many places; and

objects near one another (as glasses and china on shelves) wore knocked

together. In some cases alarm was shown by the lower animals. But the

wave or undulation was not observed with any thing like precision, except

in one case, in which a floor was distinctly seen to have such a movement.

The late hour, however, was unfavourable for observation on the part of

many persons. One only of the observers whose accounts have been fur-

nished to me had any previous experience of earthquakes. This gentleman

had resided for some time in the East. Another witness, in every way com-

petent, experienced a repetition of the shock at Thornhill at S** 46" a.m. on

the following morning ; but no information regarding this second shock has

reached me from any other part of the district.

Ninth Report of the Committee for Explorirtff Kent's Cavern, Devon-
   shire, the Committee consisting of Sir Charles Lyell^ Bart.,

   F.R.S., Professor Phillips, F.R.S., Sir John Lubbock, Bart.,
   F.R.S., John Evans, F.R.S., Edward Vivian, M.A., George
   Busk, F.R.S., William Boyd Dawkins, F.R.S., William Aysh-
   roRD Sanford, F.G.S., awe? William Pengelly, F.R.S. (Reporter.)

The Committee, in opening this their Ninth Eeport, have to state that, since
reporting at Brighton in 1872, the work has been continued without inter-
mission, in the manner observed at the commencement. They have to add
that whilst it is still conducted, under the Superintendents, by the same
foreman (George Smerdon), the second workman (John Farr), believing that
the Cavern work was prejudicial to his health, has obtained other employ-
ment. Though reluctant to part with so satisfactory a workman, who had
faithfully served them for upwards of five years, the Superintendents felt un-
able to press him to remain under the circumstances ; and they had the satis-
faction of engaging in his stead a man (John Cliunick) who has proved most

efficient and trustworthy.
    As in former years, the cavern has been visited by a large number of

persons, none of whom, when conducted by the guide only, has been allowed
to be taken to the excavations then in progress. The Superintendents have
had the pleasure of accompanying the following gentlemen during their

--visits : Major-General R. C. Schenck, Minister for the United States of

America to England ; Lord Chiford, of Chudleigh ; Sir R. Anstruther, Bart.,
M.P. ; Bev. Lord Charles Hervey, Rev. G. Butterworth, Rev. Dr. Hanna,
Rev. C. N. Kelly, Rev. R. Locker, Rev. T. R. R. Stebbing ; Major-General

Huyshe, Captain Lovett, Professor W. X. Clifford, Dr. B. Collenette, Professor
W. King, Dr. R. Martin, Dr. W. Sharpey, Dr. Topham, Dr. C. Williams, of
Burmah ; Mens. "Wyvekens, of Brussels ; and Messrs. A. T. Atchison, W.

    A. R. Hunt, Esq., M.A., F.G.S., being about to assist in exploring a small
cave on the coast of Kirkcudbright, visited the cavern in August 1873, for
the purpose of studying the mode of working.

    As in former years, live rats have been observed from time to time in
various parts of the cavern. As soon as they are seen, the workmen, having
frequently suffered from such visits, set gins for them, and sometimes succeed
in taking three or four in a week. On one occasion four (two old and
two young ones) were found in the gin together. The adults were the
 extremes of the series, and, being caught by the neck, were dead ; whilst the
others were held near the middle, and still alive. Though most prevalent

 near the entrances of the cavern, they have been frequently observed far in
the interior ; and very recently they carried off a candle from a spot fully
300 feet from the nearest entrance.

  --TJie Long Arcade. The Committee stated in their last Report, bringing the

work up to the end of July 1872, that they were then exploring the branch
ON Kent's cavern, Devonshire.                        199

of the cavern termed by Mr. MacEnery " The Long Arcade," and sometimes
" The Comdor " *, and that they had expended about ten weeks' work on it f.
The exploration of this great thoroughfare has been the work of the entire

period since that date, and it is still in progress.
   The Arcade commences in the south-west corner of the " Sloping Chamber,"

and, after a length of about 252 feet, in a west-south-westerly direction, and

--almost in a straight line, terminates in the " Cave of Inscriptions," or " Cul-de-

sac." Its height is variable being in one place not quite 10, and in others

upwards of 20 feet, the measurements being taken from the bottom of the
excavation made by the Committee. The roof and walls are much fretted and
honeycombed, except at one part not far within the entrance, where the fall

of a very large block of limestone in comparatively recent times has left edges

tolerably sharp and angular.

    Omitting blocks of limestone here and there, the surface of the deposit in

the Arcade when the Committee commenced its exploration presented but few
inequalities ; and when they had completed their excavation to the uniform
depth of 4 feet below the under surface of the Stalagmitic Floor, and up to the
distance of 134 feet from the entrance, the bottom of their section was no more

--than 40 inches above that at the commencement a mean rise of no more than

1 in 40. At the point just specified, however, the passage was almost entirely
closed with a vast mass of limestone in situ, covered in places by thick accu-
mulations of stalagmitic matter, and rising to the roof apparently from the
limestone bottom of the Arcade. The only opening in it was a narrow
aperture adjacent to the right or northerly wall ; and to gain this it was

necessary to climb to the height of 8 or 9 feet. It proved to be about 6 feet

high, to have a floor of limestone, with occasional stalagmitic incrustations,

extending for a length of fuUy 20 feet ; whilst very near the entrance, on the
left or southerly side, was the elliptical mouth of a smoothly eroded tunnel,
measuring 30 inches in horizontal and 27 in vertical diameter, and having

the aspect of a watercourse. Beyond this tunnel, and also on the left side,
lay in wild confusion several very large masses of limestone, which had fallen
from the roof obviously in remote times ; and beyond these the deposit of

Cave-earth again presented itself, but at a higher level than before.

    Assuming the tunnel just mentioned to have been a watercourse, the stream

issuing from it must have had a sudden fall of several feet ; and it may not,

perhaps, be without interest to state that on excavating the deposits in the
Arcade, deep pot-holes were found in the right wall of the cavern, having the
position and character such a fall would have produced. The tunnel, fuUy

60 feet long, terminates in a branch of the cavern known as '' The Laby-
rinth," and in one part of its course is so small as to render it somewhat
difficult for even a small man to force his way. It has long been known as

" The Little Oven ; " and when the cavern was visited by merely the idly
curious, it was regarded as an achievement to have made its passage.

    One of the results of the work during the last twelve months has been to
show that the great mass of limestone, which, as already stated, almost com-
pletely closed the Arcade, extended downwards, not to the limestone floor,
but merely to the level of the earthy deposits which choked up the passage
beneath. The 'loose and confusedly grouped blocks of limestone already
spoken of have been blasted and taken out of the cavern ; the blocked-up
passage has been reopened and is now the common thoroughfare ; the mass
of rock overhead has been dignified with the name of " The Bridge," and

the excavation has been completed far beyond it.

   The Arcade is very narroAv in proportion to its length. From 17 feet wide
at the entrance, it narrows to 5 feet at about 27 yards within, then expand-
ing to 11 or 12 feet, and again contracting until, at 42 yards, it is no more
than 6 feet wide, it once more enlarges to an average width of 9 feet, and

beyond the Bi'idge it becomes an irregular chamber, upwards of 30 feet long
and about 15 wide. The exploration has been completed to the inner end of

this chamber ; but the Arcade, again much contracted, has a further prolonga-
tion of about 50 feet before reaching the Cave of Inscriptions.

   In the left or southerly waU of the chamber just mentioned is the entrance

to the Labyrinth, and of another and smaller branch. Towards these the work-

men are now directing their labours.

   As the earlier explorers had made some excavations here and there
throughout the greater part of the Arcade, and thus deprived the Committee
of the opportunity of studying it before disturbed by man, the following
description, compiled from Mr. MacEnery's manuscripts, may be of interest :
The floor was in great disorder, strewn with rocks having between them in

certain places natural reservoirs of water, and in others loose heaps of red

marl overspreading the stalagmite and containing fossil bones. The first

rhinoceros-tooth found in the cavern was met with in one of those heaps.

A peculiarity of this passage was a profusion of a white crumbling substance

not unlike half-slacked lime. Hock after rock, on being turned over, presented

patches of it on its surface ; the loose mud also contained it ; and wherever

stalagmite had formed between the rocks, it, when ripped up, exhibited large

deposits of the same matter. In the crevices of the rock and near the surface

of the marl it occurred in baUs partly crushed ; several balls were found in

some instances pressed together, in others uninjured, adhering, and exhi-

biting the tapering point they had when dropped by the animal ; and they

were occasionally found singly. There was no doubt that they were copro-

lites, and no difi'erence between these faecal deposits and those of the hysena

in Exeter Change, except in the far greater size of the fossil balls. The

osseous substance was the same in both ; undigested particles of bone and

enamel were detected in some of them ; and the explorers were led to the con-
clusion that the Arcade was the chosen resort of the Cavern-hytenas for

purposes of cleanliness. In this they were subsequently confirmed by a letter

from Captain Sykes to Dr. Bucldand, published in the Edin. Phil. Journal*,

descriptive of a recent hyajna-cave in India, where, from the almost exclu-

sive accumulation of faeces in particular spots, the writer inferred that certain

chambers were dedicated to cleanliness. In these retreats few or no bones
occurred, " This description," says Mr. MacEnery, " is in its details quite

applicable to Kent's Hole. It appears to have been preserved to us in its

actual state as when occupied by the extinct hyajna  Whilst reading
--his letter, I imagined myself reading the history of another, sealed one the

duplicate of Kent's Cave, and not the account of a living hycena's den."

"Wherever this substance was found accompanying remains, the latter were

invariably broken, and always in the same uniform manner; and none of it was

found where they occurred entire. Dr. Buckland, to whom the material was

pointed out, gave the Arcade the name of the " Hyajnse Cloaca Maxima."

About halfway in the length of the Arcade, and near the left or southerly

wall, three circular hollows were observed in the floor, about 3 feet in dia-
meter, lined down the sides with a thin waving crust. The greasincss of the
earth, and the presence of single teeth of bear in different states of prescrva-

tion, at first suggested the idea that they were the beds of that animal, whose
habit it is to crouch in particular spots ; but the occurrence of charcoal, and
other indications of the presence of man, in the vicinity of the hollows were
thought rather to lead to the opinion that they were rude hearths or ovens
scooped out by savages, around which they collected to cook and enjoy the

spoils of the chase *.

   Before returning from this digression it may be well to offer a few remarks

on two or three points in the foregoing description, on which the exploration

now in progress is calculated to throw some light :
    Ist. " The loose heaps of red marl " in all probability consisted of material

deposited in the era of the Cave-earth, and over which no stalagmite had in
those particular spots ever been formed. If, however, they were actually
observed, and not merely inferred, to " overspread the stalagmite," the latter,
there can be little doubt, was the " Crystalline Stalagmitic Eloor," older than
the Cave-earth, of which the Committee have found numerous portions in the
Arcade during the present year, as well as in other branches of the cavern in
previous years, some of them in situ and others not.

    2nd, The Committee have also found a considerable quantity of coprolitic
matter in the Arcade, never, however, more than 12, and rarely more than
6 inches below the surface. This material has been met with in all parts of
the cavern wherever the Cave-earth has presented itself, but in no instance
in any older or more modern deposit, whether of mechanical or chemical

origin. The " Lecture Hall " may perhaps be equally entitled to the name

of the Hycence Cloaca Maccima f.
    3rd. There seems no reason to doubt that the " three circular hollows,"

instead of being the " beds of bears " or " hearths or ovens scooped out by
savages," were natural basins in the stalagmite, such as were described in the
Committee's Eighth Report +; for, to say nothing of the fact that several
such basins, even when not more than a very few inches in diameter, have con-
tained charred wood, possibly washed into them in rainy seasons (when such
basins are fuU to overflowing), or perhaps dropped into them accidentally by

recent visitors, it is difficult to understand why a savage should have selected

for his hearth a spot having nothing to recommend it but its darkness and
inconvenience, whilst so many others, in every respect more eligible, were
equally at his command. It is noteworthy that, in another part of his
memoir, Mr. MacEnery, replying to Dr. Buckland's suggestion that " the
ancient Britons had scooped out ovens in the stalagmite," says, " Without

stopping to dwell on the difficulty of ripping up a solid floor, which, notwith-
standing the advantage of undermining and the exposure of its edges, still

defies all our efforts, though commanding the apparatus of the quarry, I am

bold to say that in no instance have I discovered evidence of breaches or ovens
in the floor " §,

    But waiving all this, the Committee, on March 31 , 1873, in the course of
their work reached a hollow precisely similar to those Mr. MacEnery de-
scribes. It was of oval form, 4 feet long, 2 broad, and 9 inches deep, and

 contained nearly ten gallons of beautifully pure water, but, instead of having

been formed by a bear or a human being, it was an example of Nature's

handiwork, and in such a position as to render it certain that the foreman of

the exploration now in progress was the first human being who ever saw it.
It was in the stalagmite covering the deposit, which, as already stated, com-

pletelj filled np the space beneath the Bridge, and was neither discovered nor
discoverable until the workmen had advanced 11 feet in the difficult work of
reopening this passage.

   At the entrance of the Arcade, the Granular Stalagmitic Floor was con-
tinuous in every direction for considerable distances. At the right or
northerly wall its thickness exceeded that hitherto found in any other part of

the cavern, measuring fully 5 feet for a length of about 8 yards ; but at the
opposite wall it was very rarely more than 2 feet thick. Beyond the point
just specified it became gradually thinner, disappearing entirely at 37 feet
from it on the right wall, but extending somewhat further on the left. Still
further in, such floor as ever existed appears to have been but thin and occa-
sional only, until reaching the Bridge, where it appeared again in considerable
volume*. Almost immediately bej^ond this, there rose from the Stalagmitic
Floor a large boss of the same material, in the form of a paraboloid, 2 feet
high and 6 feet in basal circumference. As it* bore no inscription, and was

in the direct line of the work, it was dislodged and broken up, when it was

found to consist of pure stalagmite without any extraneous substance. In
the earthy deposit adhering to its base were one tooth of bear, a fragment of
bone, a ball of coprolite, and a few bits of charcoal. Not far beyond it, but

near the right wall of the Arcade, a much larger boss presented itself, having
near its summit the inscription " R. L. (or E.) 1604." The mass has been so
mutilated by early visitors as to render it uncertain whether the remaining

part of the second letter is the lower portion of L or E. The date, however,

which is quite distinct, and appears not to have been noticed prior to June 6,
1873, is the oldest at present known in the cavern, though there are several
others of the seventeenth century. In excavating, care was taken to leave
the mass, as well as the deposit on which it was formed, intact and undis-

turbed.

    The only objects found in the Granular Stalagmitic Floor, in the Arcade,
since the Eighth Report was sent in, were a tooth of Hysena, a few bones
and bone chips, a " charcoal streak " about 3 inches above the base of
the floor, where its total thickness was 42 inches at one end and 10 at the
other, a few pieces of charcoal, and a flint tool. The tool (No. 5990) is of
very white flint, having, as shown by an accidental fracture, a very chalk-like
texture. It may be described as a hammer-like " core," broad at one end,
round-pointed at the other, and formed by several flakes having been struck
from the original nodule. Its pointed end shows that it has been used as a
hammer. It is 3-2 inches long, 2 inches in greatest breadth, 1*7 inch in
greatest thickness, and was found August 19, 1872.

    As already stated, remnants of the old (the Crystalline) Stalagmitic Floor

occurred in situ in various parts of the Arcade, all attached to the right or

northerly wall, and above the level of the Granular Floor. The first of them,
about 60 feet within the entrance and 6 inches thick, had between it and the
Granular Floor an unoccupied space of 15 inches in height. The second,
20 feet further up the Arcade, was a very large mass displaying strikingly
the characteristic prismatic crystalline structure ; it has suffered much at the
hands of visitors ; and on one of its fractured surfaces is the date 1836. The

    * It is worthy of remark that at the entrance of the Arcade, where the Stalagmitic Floor
 is so very tliick, the drip of water from the roof is at present very copious in rainy
seasons, and commences within a few hours of a great rainfall ; whilst those parts of the
same branch of the cavern where there does not seem to have ever been any stalagmite
 are perfectly dry at all times and seasons.

tliird and most important, about 30 feet long, lined the entire lower surface of
the mass of limestone forming the Bridge, and extended into the chamber
beyond. The less ancient, or Granular Floor, -was in some places in contact

with it, and in others as much as 8 inches below. Numerous stones and a
few fragments of bone (representing the Breccia on which the Old Floor was

formed) were found firmly cemented to this, as well as to the first remnant.
The progress of the work has not rendered it necessary to remove or diminish
either of them.

   The deposit below the Granular Stalagmitic Floor was typical Cave-earth
to the depth of at least 4 feet *, from the entrance of the Long Arcade to
about 24 feet within it, and contained a considerable number of blocks of
limestone, several of them requiring blasting in order to be removed. Beyond
the point just specified the deposit was everywhere " Breccia " (the oldest
deposit the cavern is known to contain), except at most the uppermost foot,
which consisted of Cave-earth. The two deposits lay one on the other with-
out, as in the South-west Chamber f, any stalagmite between ; and though

--they are so very dissimilar in composition the Cave-earth, or less ancient,

being made up of small angular fragments of limestone mixed with light-red
clay, whilst the Breccia, or older deposit, consists of rounded and subangular
fragments of dark-red grit imbedded in a sandy paste of the same colour
it was not always, or, indeed, frequently, easy to detect a well-defined line of

--separation. Each, however, was, as elsewhere in the cavern, characterized

by its distinct fauna -the Breccia containing remains of Bears only without
any indication of other genera, whilst the Cave-earth yielded bones and teeth

of Hyaenas, with their teeth-marks and coprolites, as well as the osseous
remnants of the animals usually associated with them.

   At the entrance of the Arcade Mr. MacEnery's diggings were carried to a

depth of 3 feet below the bottom of the Granular Stalagmite ; they gradually
became less and less deep until at a distance of 15 feet they ceased. They
were resumed at 52 feet, and continued at intervals throughout the entire
length of the Arcade so far as the Committee have at present explored. They
were, however, on a very limited scale, never exceeding 18 inches, and com-
monly not more than a foot in depth, did not always extend from wall to wall,
and were not continuous. In short, he seems to have contented himself with
occasionally digging a small shallow trial pit, and, meeting with no speci-

mens, to have i^roceeded elsewhere ; and this is borne out by his own state-
ment. " As we advanced in the direction of the Long Corridor," he says,
" the bones became less and less numerous until they nearly disappeared,

rendering it not worth our while to prosecute our researches further in that

line " J. He must, however, in some instances have broken up portions of the

Breccia as well as of the thin layer of Cave-earth lying on it ; for, as was his
wont, the materials he dislodged were not taken out of the cavern, but merely
cast aside ; and these, on being carefully examined by the Committee, were
found to contain undoubted fragments of the older deposit, with bones and
teeth of Bear firmly imbedded in them.

    The specimens recovered from this broken ground, and which had been
neglected or overlooked, belonged mainly to the Cave-earth. They were 72
teeth, 4 astragali, 5 ossa calcis, 15 phalanges, 1 claw, 3 portions of jaws, 2 ver-
tebraj, 1 portion of skull and 1 of antler, several fragments of bone, and 8

flint flakes and chips. With them was a portion of an iron hammer, which,
on becoming useless, MacEaery or his workmen had no doubt thrown away.

   Omitting those of Bear, at least some of which belonged to the era of the

Breccia as already stated, the teeth may be distributed as in the following
Table :--

--Table I. Showing how many per cent, of the Teeth found in the dis-

       turbed material in the Long Arcade belonged to the diff'erent kinds of

       Cave Mammals.

Horse        10 ,,                      1-5 ,,
Rhinoceros   10 ,,         Elephant     1-5 ,,
Deer
              3 ,,         Fox

   The flint flakes mentioned above were of little value when compared with
many found in the Cave-earth.

   Up to the end of August 1873, the Cave-earth which the Committee found
intact in the Long Arcade had yielded, when the few mentioned in the Eighth
Report (1872) are included, about 280 teeth, which may be apportioned as in

the following Table :

--Table II. Showing how many per cent, of the Teeth found in Cave-earth in

      the Long Arcade belonged to the difl'erent kinds of Cave Mammals.

   On comparing the foregoing Tables with those in previous Reports, the

following facts present themselves :

    1st. That Hyaena is everywhere the most prevalent animal of the Cave-
earth era, and is followed by the Horse and Rhinoceros without any consider-

able variation in their ratios.

   2ud. That the Bear is relatively more prevalent in the Long Arcade than
in any other part of the cavern explored by the Committee.

  --3rd. That teeth of Wolf, Badger, Rabbit, Reindeer, and Sheep * all of

which presented themselves in the various branches of the Eastern Division

--of the cavern have not hitherto been met with in the Long Arcade.

   None of the animal remains found in the Cave-earth during the last twelve
months require detailed description or special remark. Many of the bones
had been gnawed by the Hyaena ; some were much decayed ; a few small
fragments had been burnt ; and one (a phalanx) exhibited marks of disease.

The few remains of the Mammoth were those of immature animals ; one

canine of Lion (No. 6020) was worn almost to the fang ; and a right lower
jaw of Pig (No. 6098)t, found March 26, 1873, without any other specimen
near it, contained eight teeth, some of which had not risen quite above the jaw.

    Including the two (Nos. 5819 and 5829) mentioned in the Eighth Report
(1872), the Cave-earth in the Long Arcade has, up to the end of August

in Mr. MacEneiy's dislodged materials. Though many of them would have                     · v^"

attracted a large share of attention a few years ago, a description of a very    u^^i/
few will suffice at present :
                                                                                  /'
    No. 6082 is a light-grey flint having a sharp edge all round its perimeter.
It is nearly flat on one side, and sUghtly convex on the other, from which
four principal longitudinal flakes have been dislodged. It belongs to the lan-
ceolate variety of implements, is about 3-5 inches long, 1-2 inch in greatest
breadth, and -25 inch in thickness. It was found February 22ud, 1873, without
any animal remains near it ; and no stalagmite had ever covered the deposit
in which it lay.

   No. 6086 may be said to belong to the same type; but it is more massive,

and is abruptly truncated at each end. It is 3-5 inches long, 1-6 inch
in greatest breadth, '0 inch thick, very concave on the inner face, on

which the " bulb of percussion " is well displayed near what may be termed

the point ; and the outer very convex face has been rudely fashioned. It does
not appear to have been used ; its edges are quite sharp and not serrated
or chipped. It was found March 4, 1873, with a tooth and a gnawed scapula

(No. 6086).

   As in all other parts of the cavern in which it has occurred, the Breccia
in the Long Arcade difli'ers from the Cave-earth not only in the mineral and

mechanical characters of its materials, as already pointed out, but also in the
absence of those films of stalagmite which so frequently invested bones and

stones at all levels in the less-ancient accumulation.

   The deposits resembled each other in being entirely destitute of any ap-
proach to a stratified arrangement ; and the incorporated fragments of stone

lay with their longest axes in every possible direction.

   Up to the end of August 1873 there had been found in the Breccia in the

Long Arcade upwards of fifty teeth, together with a considerable number of
bones, of Bear. As they were much more brittle than those found in the
Cave-earth, probably from their highly mineralized condition, and almost
invariably occurred where the materials were firmly cemented together,
it was impossible to prevent their being injured in the process of extraction.
Not unfrequently bones or teeth were found broken but having the parts in
contact and juxtaposition in the concrete, showing that they had been
broken where they lay and where they were found. Beyond a few teeth

still occupying portions of jaws, the remains did not lie in their natural ana-
tomical order ; and isolated teeth frequently presented themselves com-
pletely encased with Breccia. In no instance was there any thing like an

approach to the elements of a complete skeleton, or distinct portion of

one, lying together.

   The only noteworthy specimens are a left lower jaw (No. 6127) containing
two teeth, found June 18, 1873, and a palate (No. 6133) with the greater
part of the upper jaw, in which were four molars and the two canines. This
fine specimen was found June 25, 1873, and with it two other canines and a

few fragments of bone.
    It is perhaps worthy of remark that as no trace of Machairodits has

been found in either of the deposits since the Eighth Eeport (1872) was
presented, the Committee can only repeat that, so far as the evidence goes at
present, that great Carnivore was a member of the fauna of the Cave-earth

era, but not of that of the Breccia.
    In their Eighth Report (1872) the Committee stated that they had

found two flint implements (Nos. 5900 and 5903) in the Breccia in the
"Southern Branch" of the "Charcoal Cave;" and they pointed out the important

hearing of the fact on the question of Human Antiquity *. They have now

the pleasure of reporting the discovery, during the last twelve months, of
seventeen additional implements, flakes, and chij^s in the same deposit in the

Long Arcade; and they now propose to describe the most striking specimens.

    No. 6022 is a fine kite-shaped flint tool, 5*1 inches long, 2-6 inches in

greatest breadth, and 2 inches in greatest thickness. On one side, especially
at the butt-end, it is very convex ; on the other it may be said to have a ten-

dency to flatness ; but as this inner face consists of two principal planes or
facets sloping in opposite directions from a transverse ridge about midway in
its length, the flatness is not strongly pronounced. At the butt-end, on the

convex face, it retains much of the original surface of the nodule, and shows
that it was made from a well-rolled pebble. The rest of the surface has a
somewhat orange-coloured ferruginous tint, derived, no doubt, from the
matrix in which it was found. On one or two small facets near the point, how-

Aever, this tint does not appear, but the true whitish colour is displayed. small

chip has been unfortunately struck from it by the tool of the workman and
thus displays the interior, which is of the same colour as the facets just
named, but diff'ers from them in being somewhat granular, whilst they are

quite smooth. "Within the substance of the implement and near the point
there is a small irregular quartz pebble, apparently the nucleus around which
the siliceous matter accumulated. This specimen was found on November
27, 1872, at a depth of 16 inches in the undisturbed Breccia under a block

 of limestone measuring 24 x 14 x 14 inches, adjacent to the left wall of the
 Arcade, and 73 feet from its entrance. No animal remains or other objects

 of interest were found near it.

    No. 6025 may be described as a fine implement, rudely foot-shaped, 5-4

 inches long, 2-5 inches in greatest breadth, and 1-7 inch in greatest thick-
 ness. It has undergone a considerable amount of chipping, is very convex
 on one face, has a tendency to flatness on the other ; and no portion of the
 original surface of the nodule remains on it. It is of a yellowish drab colour,
 and has a patina on the greater part of its surface. It was found on
 December 9, 1872, not quite a foot deep in the Breccia, very near the left
 wall of the Arcade, about 86 feet from its entrance, and without any animal
 remains accompanying it.

     No. 6081 is an orange-coloured flint implement, rudely elliptical in out-
 line, very massive, about 6 inches long, 3-7 inches in greatest breadth, 2
 inches in greatest thickness, very convex on one face, with a tendency to
 flatness on the other, has a great number of facets on each face, but with

 portions of the original crust of the nodule here and there. On the flatter

 face there is a rugged elliptical hole, nearly central, -9 inch long, -65 inch
 broad, and '7 inch deep ; but instead of being artificial is structural, as the
  original crust of the flint extends into it from a neighbouring patch on the
 face of the tool. This specimen was found in the third-foot level of
 Breccia, without any organic remains near it, on February 14, 1873, at
  about 122 feet from the entrance of the Arcade.

     No. 6103 is a coarse chert tool about 4 inches long, 2*3 inches in
  greatest breadth, 1-6 inch in greatest thickness, very convex on both faces,

 and worked to an edge all round. A large amount of labour has been bestowed

  in fashioning it; and no part of the original surface of the nodule remains.

 It was found, without any animal remains near it, May 7, 1873, in the

fourth- or lowest-foot level of the Breccia, a small portion of -which ad-

heres to it.

    No. 6110, apparently of the same variety of chert, is rndcly semilunar in
form, 2*9 inches long, 1-8 inch in greatest breadth, and 1-2 inch in greatest
thickness. It has a thin edge on its rectilineal margin, hut attains its
greatest thickness at its curvUineal margin, and seems to have been used as a

scraper. It was found May 28th, 1873, at about 166 feet from the entrance

of the Arcade, without any organic remains near it, in the second-foot level
of the Breccia, traces of which still remain on it.

   No. 6128 may be said to be at once a rude parallelogram and an oval. It

is 2-9 inches long, 1-9 inch in greatest breadth, -8 inch in greatest thickness,
slightly and irregularly concave on one face, and convex on the other. Its

greatest thickness is very near one margin, whence it slopes to a compara-
tively thin edge on the other. Its internal structure is somewhat chalk-
like ; and it has probably been somewhat rolled. It was found about 172
feet from the entrance of the Arcade in the first-foot level of the Breccia,
without any noteworthy objects near it, on June 18, 1873.

    No. 6129 is a fine implement of the same form as No. 6022. It is 5-5
inches long, 2*8 inches in greatest breadth, 1'6 inch in greatest thickness,
approximates flatness on one face, and is very protuberant on the other,
which retains a portion of the original surface of the nodule. It is of a
somewhat coarse cherty structure and a dull pinkish colour. It was found
on June 20, 1873, in the fourth-foot level of the Bi'eccia, almost immediately
under No. 6128, but 3 feet deeper in the deposit, and without any bones or

teeth near it.

   No. 6139 is a faint pink unshapen lump of flint, the surface of which has
nevertheless been artificially produced. It may be a " core," or an imple-
ment spoiled in the attempt to make it. It was found about 128 feet from
the entrance of the Arcade, without any objects of interest near it, in the

third-foot level of the Breccia, on July 2, 1873.
    No. 6174, like Nos. 6110 and 6128, is thickest at one margin, and

slopes thence to an edge at the other, and, like them, has probably been
used as a scraper. It is 2-6 inches long, 1*6 inch in greatest breadth, and
1*1 inch in greatest thickness. It was found, with a tooth of Bear and a
few bones, on August 19, 1873, in the second-foot level of the Breccia, at
about 128 feet from the entrance of the Arcade.

   The facts disclosed since the Committee sent in their Eighth Report, and
which have been described above, point to certain conclusions and sug-
gest a few speculations to which it may not be out of place to call attention.

   The remnants of Crystalline Stalagmitic Floor in the Long Arcade, with
stones still cemented to their under surfaces, like those in the Gallery opening
out of the Great Chamber* and in the branches of the Charcoal Cavef, are
capable of but one explanation. They point to a time when the Breccia was
introduced ; and they mark or define the height it reached ; they show a sub-
sequent period when this accumulation was sealed up with a calcareous sheet
of which they are the remnants ; and they make known the facts that a por-
tion of the Breccia was dislodged, and vast masses of the Floor which covered
it were broken up. This was followed by the introduction of the Cave-earth,
and that by the formation of another Floor of Stalagmite, diff'ering from the

former in being granular instead of crystalline.
   That the Breccia was derived from without the cavern is certain from the

* See Eeport Brit. Assoc. 1867, pp. 4-5.  f Ibid. 1872, pp. 41-42.
208 REPORT--1873.

fact that the Cavern-hill contains no rock capable of furnishing the mate-
rials composing it. Such materials, however, are derivable from loftier adja-
cent eminences.

    That these materials were introduced with comparative rapidity is pro-
bably indicated by the paucity, to say the least, of angular fragments of
limestone, as well as of lilms of stalagmite on the stones or bones, both of
which the walls and roof of the cavern would in aU probability have sup-
plied during a protracted period.

    That the conditions of the surface of the district adjacent to the cavern
must have changed between the period of the Breccia and that of the Cave-
earth, is manifest from the fact that such materials as formed the staple of the
earlier deposit did not find access daring the later.

   The scantiness of the Cave-earth in the Arcade, aud its immense volume in

the eastern division of the cavern, especially in the branches of it into
which the external entrances open, as well as those immediately adjacent,
indicates that this deposit was derived largely, if not entirely, from external
sources, and not from the wasting of the walls and roof of the cavern, since
there is no reason to suppose that the rate of disintegration or decomposition
would differ so very greatly in the different Chambers and Galleries. It

may be worthy of remark, moreover, that, all other things being the same,

the thickness or depth of a deposit derived from the waste of the walls and
roof of a chamber must be greatest in the narrowest chamber, whilst the re-

verse obtains in the present case.

  A glance at the implements from the two deposits shows that they are

very dissimilar. Those from the Breccia are much more rudely formed, more
massive, have less symmetry of outline, and were made by operating, not on

flakes purposely struck off from nodules of flint or chert, as in the case of
those from the Cave-earth, but directly on the nodules themselves, all of
which appear to have been obtained from accumulations of supracretaceous
flint-gravel, such as occur about four miles from the cavern. There seems

no doubt, then, that the Breccia men were ruder than those of the Cave-
earth ; and this is borne out by the fact that whilst the men represented by

--the later deposit made bone tools and ornaments harpoons for spearing fish,

eyed needles or bodkins for stitching skins together, awls perhaps to facilitate
the passage of the slender needle or bodkin through the tough thick hides,

--pins for fastening the skins they wore, and perforated Badger's teeth for

necklaces or bracelets nothing of the kind has been found in the Breccia.
In short, the stone tools, though both sets were unpolished and coeval
with extinct mammals, represent two distinct civilizations.

   It is equally clear that the ruder men were the more ancient ; for their
tools were lodged in a deposit which, when the two occurred in the same ver-
tical section, was invariably the undermost. In fact the Breccia in which

each of the implements was deposited actually had Cave-earth lying on it.
   That the chronological interval separating the two deposits, tools, men,

and eras was a great one is indicated by the several facts which have been
enumerated. The altered condition of the surface of the adjacent district
manifested by the dissimilar mineral and physical characters of the deposits,
the sheet of Crystalline Stalagmite which usually separated them and some-
times attained a thickness little short of 12 feet, the destruction of great

masses of this sheet, the dislodgment of a considerable portion of the Breccia
on which it was formed, and the distinctness of the two Cavern-faunai are

phenomena very significant of an amount of time incapable of compression
within narrow limits.
          ON FLINT AND CHERT IMPLEMENTS PROM KENt's CAVERN. 209

   When the cavern-haunting habits of the Hyaena are remembered, it can

scarcely be unsafe to conclude from the absence of any trace of him in the
Breccia that he was not an inhabitant of Britain during the era of that de-
posit. The same argument can by no means be applied with equal force to

the Horse, Ox, Deer, &c., whose absence is equally pronounced ; for it may

be presumed that their bones occur in caverns at least mainly because their
dead bodies were dragged there piecemeal by the Hyasna ; and this could not
have occurred before his arrival. The Ursine remains met with in the
Breccia present no difficulty, as the Bear, like the Hy£ena,is a cave-dweller*.

   The fact that though he was not a member of the British fauna during the

era of the Breccia, he had become very prevalent during that of the Cave-earth,

may probably be taken as indicating that after, but not during, the period of

the Breccia, Britain was a part of continental Europe, and thus rendered his

arrival possible. If this be admitted, it follows that the early men of Devon-

shire saw this country pass from an insular to a continental state, and again
become an island.

   The Superintendents of the work, struck with the great development of the
Breccia in the innermost parts of the cavern, as well as with the numerous
remains of Bear which it contains, are strongly inclined to the opinion that
there must be an external entrance hitherto unsuspected, and at present
choked up, in the direction in which the work is progressing. It must be
admitted that this would solve several problems of interest ; but the complete
exploration of the cavern can alone show whether or not such an entrance

exists.

Though there are said to be persons capable of believing that the so-

called flint and chert implements, found in Kent's Hole and other caverns^

are merely natural products, it is nat mj intention in this brief paper to say

one word on that question. It has been treated so fully and so ably by

various writers as to deprive me of any pretence for attempting to add any

thing to the literature of the subject, and also of any hope that such additions
as I might be able to make would convince those stiU remaining in a sceptical

* Dr. A. Leith Adams, M.A., F.R.S., F.G.S., so well known aa a naturalist and cavern-

Brown Bear of the Himalayas : " The Brown Bear of the Western Himalayas hybernates,

choosing chiefly caverns and rock-crevices, which it abandons in spring to wander about ; but

old individuals, when nO longer equal to the same amount of exertion, take to a secluded life,

and usually select a cavern on a rocky mountain-side, at tlie base of which there is abundant

verdure and shade, with a pool or spring, where they bathe frequently or recline during

the heat of the day to escape annoyance from insects. Sucli retreats are easily discovered

by the animal's footprints on the soil and turf. They are seen like steps of sUiirs lo iding

from the pool in the direction of the den, being brought about by the individual always

treading in the same track. Thus these patriarchs or liermit bears spend their latter years

in one situation, pursuing the even tenor of their ways to the little stream or pc>nd below,

--and grassy slopes to feed on the rank vegetation, returning regidarly to the caverns where

they end their days." See Wanderings of a Naturalist in India, Western Himalayas, and

Mystate.      present object is to call attention to the fact that whilst all the

noteworthy flint and chert implements which Kent's Hole has yielded are

nnpolished, and all fonnd with the remains of tlie extinct Cave mammals,

they belong to two distinct classes, eras, and states of civilization.

   It may be well at the outset to describe brieflj'^ the successive deposits

and their contents met with during the exploration of the cavern by the

Committee appointed by the British Association in 18G4, whose labours have

extended without interruption from March 186-5 to the present time, and are

still in progress. Thej^ are as foUow :

1st, or ujipcrmost, Blocks of limestone, from a few pounds to upwards of

one hundred tons each, which had fallen from the roof, from time to time,

and were occasionall}- cemented together with stalagmite.

2nd. Beneath and between the blocks just mentioned lay a dark-coloured

mud, from 3 to 12 inches thick, and known as the Blade Mould.

  A3rd. Stalagmitic Floor of granular texture, varying from an inch to

upwards of 5 feet in thickness, and frequently containing large blocks of

limestone similar to those mentioned above. This was known as the Granular

/Stalagmite.

4th. An almost black layer, composed mainly of small fragments of

charred wood, and about 4 inches thick. This, termed the Black Band,

was a local deposit occupying an area of about 100 square feet, and, at its

nearest approach to it, aboiit 32 feet from one of the entrances to the cavern.

 --Sth. An accumulation of light-red clay, containing : on the average, about

50 per cent, of small angular fragments of limestone, with occasional blocks

of the same substance as lai'ge as those lying on the surface as already stated
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

large isolated masses of stalagmite having a very crystalline texture ; suban-
gular and rounded fragments of quartz and red grit, derivable not from the

Cavern hill, but from the adjacent and greater heights ; and a very few granitic

pebl)les. This, known as the Cave-earth, was usually of unknown depth,

but it certainly, and perhaps greatly, exceeded 4 feet in most cases.

   6th. Wherever the bottom of the Cave- earth was reached, however, there
was found beneath it a Floor of Stalagmite, having a crystalline texture

identical with that of the detached isolated masses incorporated in the Cave-

earth as just stated. This, designated the VnjstalUne Stalagmite, was in
some instances little short of 12 feet thick.

   7th. Below the whole there lay, so far as is at present known, the lowest
and oldest of the Cavern deposits, consisting of subangular and rounded

pieces of dark-red grit, imbedded in a sandy paste of the same coloui'. This,
the thickness of which is unknown, is denominated the Breccia.

   The lumps of stalagmite and fragments of grit found imbedded in the
Cave-earth were undoubtedly portions of the two older deposits (the Crystal-

line Stidagmite and the Breccia), and show that these accumulations had

l)ecn broken up by natural agency before the introduction of the Cave-earth,
and that they were formerly of greater volume than at present.

Excepting the overlying blocks of limestone, No. 1, all the deposits just

desci-ibed contained remains of animals. In the Black llould, or most modern,

they were those of species still existing, and almost all of them now occupying
the district. They were man, dog, fox, badger, brown bear. Bos longifrons,

roe-deer, sheep, goat, pig, hare, rabbit, water-rat, and seal. In the Granular

Btalagmite, Black Band, and Cave-earth, and especially the last, extinct as
well as recent animals presented themselves, the Cave-hya3na being the most
prevalent, but followed very closely by the horse and rhinoceros. Remains

of the so-called Irish elk, wild bull, bison, red deer, mammoth, badger, the cave-.

grizzly, and brown bears, Tvere by no means rare ; those of the cave-lion, wolf,
fox, and reindeer were less numcroiis ; and those of beaver, glutton, and
Macliairodus latkUns were very scarce. The presence of the hyajna was also
indicated by his coprolites, by bones broken after a manner still followed by
existing members of the same genus, and by the marks of his teeth found on
a very large proportion of the osseous remains in the cavern. In the lower
deposits (the Crystalliuo Stalagmite and the Breccia) remains of animals
were less uniformly distributed. In some places there were none throughout
considerable spaces, whilst in others they were so crowded as to form 50 per
cent, of the entire deposit. So far as is at present known, they were ex-
clusivel}' those of bear. Not only were there no bones of hyaena, there
were none of his faeces, none of his teeth-marks, and no bones fractured
after his well-known fashion, llemembering his cavern-haunting habits, it

may in all probability be safely concluded that the era of the Crystalline

Stalagmite and of the Breccia it covered, was prior to the advent of the
hytena in this country. The same inference cannot with certainty be drawn
with respect to the horse, ox, deer, &c., whose absence is equally pro-

nounced ; for it may be presumed that their bones occur in caverns simply

because their dead bodies were dragged there piecemeal ; and this would not
have occurred, even though they had occupied the country, before the arrival

of the great bone-eating scavenger which we call the cave-h5faena. The

bear, being a cave-dweller, presents no diihculty.
   The bones found in the uppermost deposit, the Black Mould, were of

much less specific gravity than those in the lower accumulations, and were

generally so light as to iioat in water. Those in the Cave-earth and Breccia

had lost their animal matter, and adhered to the tongue when applied to it,
so as frequently to support their own weight ; but those from the Breccia
(the lowest or oldest deposit) were much more mineralized and brittle than

those found in the Cave-earth, and usually emitted a metalKc ring when,

struck.

   The following general statements may be of service here, by way of reca-

pitulation, before proceeding further :
    1st. Omitting the overlying blocks of limestone and the local Black Band,

--the cavern contained three distinct mechanical accumulations : the Black

Mould, or vippermost, or most modern ; the Cave-earth ; and the Breccia, or
lowermost, or most ancient. Their mode of succession was never transgressed
and the materials of which they consisted were so very dissimilar as to cha-

racterize them mth great distinctness.

    2nd. These three accumulations were separated by two distinct floors of
Stalagmite having strongly contrasted characters. That between the Breccia
below and the Cave-earth above it was eminently crystalline, whilst that
dividing the Cave- earth from the Black Mould was granular.

   3rd. Animal remains occurred in all, but were much more abundant in the

mechanical deposits than in the Stalagmites.
    4th. The period represented by the Breccia and Crystalline Stalagmite (the

most ancient period) may, as a matter of convenience, and so far as the cavern
is concerned, be termed the Ursine period, these deposits having yielded
remains of bears only. It must be understood, however, that bears are re-

presented in all the deposits.

   5th. The period of the Cave-earth and Granular Stalagmite may be deno-

minated the Hymnine period, the remains of hyaena being restricted to these
deposits and being more prevalent than those of any other genus.

   6th. The period of the Black Mould (the most modern period) may be

                                                                                                 p2

called the Ovine period, remains of the sheep being restricted to this accu-

mulation.

    7tb. The bones of each period were distinguishable by their physical con-

--dition those from the Black Mould being lighter, and those in the Breccia

more mineralized, than the products of the Cave-earth.
    Flint and chert implements presented themselves in each of the niecJui-

nical deposits ; and, as in the case of the bones, those belonging to any one
were easily distinguishable from those of the other two.

   The implements of the Black Mould, the uppermost deposit, were of the
ordinary colour of common flints. They were mere flakes and " strike-
lights," the latter probably used and cast aside or lost by those who during
a long period, and before the invention of lucifer-matches, acted as guides to

the cavern. All further notice of them may be omitted as not being note-

Avorthy.

    Omitting mere flakes, of which there were great numbers, the principal
flint implements found in the Cave-earth were ovoid, lanceolate, and tongue-
shaped, produced by fashioning, not flint nodules, but flakes struck off
them. They were of comparatively somewhat delicate proportions, usually
of a white colour and porcellaneous aspect, and had, through metamor-

phosis, a granular chalk-like internal textui'e.

   Flint implements were not the only human industrial remains found in the

Cave-earth, as it had yielded a bone needle with a well-formed eye, three
bone harpoons (one of them barbed on both sides, and the others on one only),
a bone pin, a bone awl, and a badger's tooth having its fang artificially
perforated for the purpose apparently of being strung with other objects to
form a necklace or bracelet, thus indicating that the Cave-dwellers of the
hyanine period occupied themselves in making ornaments as well as objects
of mere utUity.

   The implements from the Breccia are much more rudely formed, more
massive, less symmetrical in outline, and have been made by operating, not

on flakes, but directly on nodules derived from supracretaceous accumula-

tions, and generally retain some traces of the original surface. One of
the specimens, however, is a mass of flint which may have been a " core "
from which flakes were struck, or, what seems not less probable, the useless
result of an abortive attempt to make a tool.

   No such implements have been found in the Cave-earth, nor have any of

the comparatively slender, symmetrical, and well-finished tools of the more
modern deposit been met with in the more ancient. They are by no means
so abundant as those of the Cave-earth ; that is to say, a given volume of
Breccia does not yield so maiij- implements as an equal volume of the more
modern accumulation. Whether equal periods of time are represented by
equal volumes of deposit in the two cases, or whether equal pei-iods of time
represent ecjual numbers of human cave-dwellers or tool-makers in the two
eras, are questions into which it is not possible to enter at present.
Omitting rude flakes and mere chips, as well as the " core " just mentioned,
 the Breccia up to this time has yielded no more than eleven specimens. It
 must be remembered, however, that the time during which the Committee
 have been excavating Breccia is comparatively very short.

    That the implements from the Breccia belong to a ruder age than those

from the Cave-earth may probably be safely concluded from their much

 ruder form and finish, and also, if negative evidence be trustworthy, from
 the entire absence of bone tools of any kind. That they belong to an earlier
 period is obvious from the position they occupied : they were lodged in a

 deposit which, when the two were found in the same vertical section, in-
 variably underlay the Cave-earth. In fact, the Breccia in which every one
 of the tools was found actually had Cave-earth vertically above it.

     That the chronological interval which separated the era of the older ruder
 tools from that of the others was a great one is indicated by several facts :

     1st. The conditions under which the two accumulations were deposited
 on the same area were so dissimilar, that the older mass consisted of sub-
 angiilar and rounded pieces of grit imbedded in a sandy paste produced by
 the attrition and disintegration of the same materials, whilst the less ancient
 deposit was formed of angular fragments of limestone incorporated in iine

 clay.

    2nd. The two deposits were separated by a sheet of crystalline Stalagmite,
 in some places almost 12 feet thick.

    3rd. After the Breccia had been sealed up with the Stalagmite just men-
 tioned, the latter was, in extensive parts of the cavern, broken up by some
Jiatural agency, and much of the Breccia was dislodged, before the first instal-
ment of Cave-earth was introduced.

    4th. The faunas of the two periods were also dissimilar: that of the Breccia
 did not include the hysena, which played so important a part in the
cavern-history during the Cave-earth period, and whose agency, next to that
of man, has made cavern-searching an important branch of science. His

absence in the one fauna and his presence in the other, may probably be

safely taken as indicating that after, but not during, the period of the
Breccia, Britain was connected with the continent, and thus rendered it

possible for him to roach this country. In other words, the earliest human
Devonians at present known to us saw this country an island as at present

bixt it had become part of continental Europe before the arrival of the Cavern-
hyaena amongst their descendants.

    Without attempting to estimate the amount of time represented by the
less ancient Cavern deposits (the Black Mould, the Granular Stalagmite, and
the Cave-earth), it seems impossible to doubt that the period indicated by
the formation of the Breccia and the Crystalline Stalagmite, and the
destruction and dislodgment of much of them, must be at least as great.
In other words, and speaking only for myself, however far back in time

the fabricators of the Cave-earth tools take their stand, I cannot hesitate to

place those of the implements of the Breccia as much further back. Most

of us remember, and perhaps few of us can be surprised at, the alarm occa-

sioned by the antiquity of man made known by the researches in Brixham
Cavern in 1858 ; and now I cannot doubt that cavern-researches growing out
of those just mentioned make a reasonable and irresistible demand to have

that antiquity at least doubled.

   What may be the relation of the Cave-men whose eleven tools are now

before us to preglacial times, I will not presume to say ; but I cannot divest
myself of the idea that a complete exploration of Kent's Hole is calculated

to give a definite reply to that question.

   Meanwhile it may not be without interest to remark that, up to the pre-

sent time, as the Cavern exhibits to us more and more ancient men, it shows

us that they were ruder and nider as we proceed into antiquity. The men

of the Black Mould had a great variety of bone instruments ; they used
spindle-whorls, and made pottery, and smelted and compounded metals.
The older men of the Cave-earth made a few bone tools ; they used needles,
and probably stitched skins together ; but they bad neither spindle-whorls,
nor pottery, nor metals ; their most powerful weapons were made of flint

and chert, many of them symmetrically formed and carefully chipped ; but it
seems never to have occurred to them to increase their efficiency by polish-
ing them. The still more ancient men of the Breccia have left behind them

not even a single bone tool ; their flint implements are rude and massive,
show but little attempt at regularity of outline, and are but rudely chipped.

Report of the Coinmittee, consisting of Dr. Gladstone^ Dr. C. E. A.

   WrighTj and W. Chandler Roberts, appointed for the purpose of

   investigating the Chemical Constitution and Optical Properties of

   Essential Oils. Drawn up Inj Dr. Wright.

Since the last Meeting of the Association, a number of points connected with
the experiments then made have been fully worked out, and some interesting
information gained on the subject of isomerism among bodies of the terpene
class and their derivatives.

   The action of nitric acid on the terpene of turpentine-oil has been shown
by Schwanert to give rise to a non-crystalline acid (ccnnp7i7-esic acid), which
is tribasic, and is expressed by the formula Cj^H^^O^ ; the terpene of nutmeg-
oil has been found to give rise by similar treatment to oxalic acid, and an
acid resembling honey when freshly prepared, but solidifying to a crystalline
mass on standing for some months. This has been termed Myristisic acid
its analysis agrees with the formula C.,,,II.,,,0,g, 2H,0, the 2H.,0 being lost at
100° C, and 6 of the 26 proportions of hydrogen being replaceable by calcium.
Simultaneously, toluic and torephthalic acids are prodiiced by the oxidation
of the cymeue naturally admixed with the terpene.

   Hesperidene, the terpene of orange-oil, when treated in the same way, gives
neither toluic nor terephthalic acid ; oxalic acid, and an acid much resem-
bling myristisic acid but containing more oxygen, are formed ; this acid,
which has been termed Hesperisic acid, is expressed by the formula C^^H^jO^,
2H2O, the 2TL,f> being lost at 100°, and 6 proportions of hydrogen being

replaceable by calcium.

   From the character of the oxidation products, it thus seems that the ter-

penes of turpentine, nutmeg-oil, and orange-oil are not identical, but only

--isomeric a conclusion already drawn from their different physical proper-

ties {e.g. their boUiug-points, 160°, 163°-164°, and 178° respectively);

turpentine-oil when oxidized also gives rise to smaU quantities of terephthalic
acid ; this, however, without doubt arises from the presence of cymene in

ordinary tui-pentino {vide infra).

    Although hesperidene contains no cymene ready formed (as proved by the
non-formation of toluic and terephthalic acids from it by oxidation, and the
failure in extracting cymene by a method which readily yields that hydro-
carbon when applied to oil of turpentine or to the mixed hydrocarbons of
nutmeg-oU) it is nevertheless closely related to that substance ; by cautiously
adding two equivalents of bromine to one of hesperidene, a dibromide is
formed (with evolution of heat) : on attempting to distil this product it
breaks up into hydrobromic acid and cymene, thus,

                   C,,,H^,Br, = C,,,H,,Er-HHBr=C,,,H,,-t-2HBr.
An intermediate unstable body, Cj,,Hjj.Br, appears to be formed ; but three or

four distUlations suffice to break up the dibromide almost wholly into cymene
             ON THE CO.XbTlTUlION JiTC. Ol' ESSENTIAL OILS.                 215

and hydrobromic acid : a small quantity of nou-volatilc resinous matter is
formed; otherwise the yield of cymeuo approaches the theoretical (]uantit}'.

    Precisely the same result takes place on adding two equivalents of bromine
to the lowest-boiling fraction of nutmeg hydrocarbons (boiling at 1G3°-1G4°,
and containing 10 to 12 per cent, of cymene ready formed), with these dif-

--ferences that the yield of cymene is much less in this case, half the terpeno

present being converted into non-volatilc black resinous substances, and,

secondly, that much more heat is generated by the union of a given quantity
of bromine with the nutmcg-terpeue than is with the same amount of hes-
pei-idene. The higher the boiling-point of the original torpcne, the more
readily does its dibromide break up into cymene and hydrobromic acid : thus

hcspcridene dibromide gives not far from the theoretical yield ; nutmeg- ter-

pene dibromide about 50 per cent, only ; whilst turpentine dibromide is but
little affected by heat alone (Oppenheim), although it does yield some cymene

--by this treatment (Grevillo Williams ; Barbier), the boiling-points of the

three terpencs being respectively 178°, 163°-104°, and 160°.
   The same difference between hesperidene and the nutmcg-terpene is notice-

able when equal quantities of the two are shaken up with their own bulks of
strong sulphuric acid : the terpeues are polymerized, much heat being evolved,
this evolution being much greater in the case of the nutmeg-tcrpene. Attempts

to estimate quantitatively the difference in heat-development did not lead to

any trustworthy results, beyond indicating the bare fact that there is a great

difference.

Taking into consideration these circumstances, together with the researches

of Fabre and Silbermann on the heats of combustion of acids of the acetic

series and compound others isomeric with them, and on the hydrocarbons of

the oletine family, it appears extremely probable that the higher the boiling-

point of any member of a series of isomeridcs, the greater is the " affinity "

between its constituent elements (t. e. the greater is the work performed in

their union), and consequently the less is what may be termed the intrinsic

chemical energij of the compound ((. e. the less work can be obtained by the

conversion   of a  given  weight  of  the  compound  into  other  constant  products)
                                                                                                                       ;

or in other words, the heat of combustion of an isomeride of Jiighcr bollimj-
point is less than that of one of lower hoillng -point. It has not yet beeu found
practicable to test this point in the case of the isomeric terpenes, first, on

account of the difficulty of obtaining perfect combustion, and other experi-

mental errors, and, secondly, on account of the difficulty in getting terpenes

free from cymene to operate on. It is, however, hoped that some satisfac-

tory evidence on this head may be obtained whenever the experiments on

various oils &c. have disclosed the existence of a terpene which, like hesperi-

dene, appears to be one single homogeneous body of formula Cj^Hj^, ; in the

mean time the author cordially invites aU chemists who are interested in this

point, so vitaUy connected with the subject of isomerism, to submit it to the

tost of experiment in any cases that may seem to them promising.

In order to make sure that the cymenes thus obtained from hesperidene and

nutmeg-terpene are identical with the ordinary cymene from cummin-oil, a

carefal examination was made of specimens of cymene derived from every
available source. Fittig, Kobrich, and Jilke have shown that the cymene ob-

tained tVom camphor by the action of zinc chloride is mixed with a largo

number of other substances ; this circumstance appears to have misled Kekide

and others into the belief that there are two distinct isomeridcs, a couclusiou

entirely negatived by the experiments described below.

The cymenes from the dibromides obtained as above were purified by frac-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

lional distillation, and their optical properties were determined by Dr.
Gladstone ; their corrected boiling-points were accurately detei-mined ; com-
bustions were made of them ; and the products of their oxidation by chromic
acid were carefully studied. Other cymenes from the undermentioned sources
were also submitted to the same treatment,

  --A. Cymene from Myristicol by the action of Zinc Chloride. When myristicol

is treated with solid zinc chloride in a small retort, a powerful action takes
place before the boiling-point is reached, water and cymene distil over, and
a non-volatile resinous mass is left in the retort. This resinous mass appears
to be formed by the reaction

                        2n(C,AeO)=nH,0 + (C,,,H3,,0),,.

    After purification by shaking up with sulphuric acid and distillation over
sodium, the distillate yields tolerably pure cymene.

  --B. From Myristicol by the action of Phosphorus PentncMoride.- As stated

in last year's Report, myristicol, when treated with phosphorus pentachloride,

undergoes the reaction

                    PCL + C,,,H,,0 = POCI3 + HCl -h C,,,H,,C1

the resulting body, Cj^H^jCl, breaks up on heating into hydrochloric acid and
tolerably pure cymene.

  --C. From Camphor by Phosphorus Pentachloride. Louguinine and Lippmann

have shown that the chlorinated body, Cj^H^jCl, obtained by Gerhardt and by
Pfaundler by the action of phosphorus pentachloride on camphor, breaks up
readily on continued distillation, forming hydrochloric acid and apparently
pure cymene ; their experiments were repeated, and their results confirmed in

every respect.

 --D. Cymene from Hydrocarbons of Nutmey-oil (preexisting). As stated in

last year's Eeport (Appendix), by treating the lowest-boiling fraction (163°-
] 64°) of nutmeg hydrocarbon with strong sulphuric acid, the terpene is poly-
merized ; the resulting mass, when diluted with water and distilled, furnished

a crude cymene, which may be purified by repetition of the process and frac-

tional distillation over sodium.

 --E. Cymene preexisting in Turpentine. Turpentine-oil was distilled over

sodium, and found to boil at 156°-159°; on treatment with sulphuric acid
&c., about 3 per cent, of cymene was isolated.

    Recently Eiban has published some experiments almost identical in their
result with the foregoing observations (made in September and October 1872);
he, however, concludes that the cymene is derived from the terpene through
the oxidation of H^ by the sulphuric acid. The author dissents from this con-
clusion for various reasons, the two chief ones of which are that hesperidene
yields no cymene whatever by this treatment (although it does by bromine

and heat), and that cymene may be obtained from nutmeg hydrocarbons or

from oil of turpentine without evolution of sulphur dioxide, if very great care
be taken.

   Kekule, also, has recently obtained cymene from oil of turpentine by con-
tinued distillation along with iodine ; he considers that a diiodide is formed
and split up into hydriodic acid and cymene by the heat employed : this is by
no means improbable ; but it is not impossible that the iodine simjily poly-
merizes the terpene present, leaving the cymene originally present imaltered.

 --P. Cymene from Cummin-oil. Cummin-oil was distilled, a non-volatile

resin of empirical formula Cj^Hj^O being left in the retort ; the distillate was
shaken with sodium bisulphite and the uncombined cymene purified by treats
ment with sulphiiric acid and distillation over sodium.

 --H. Cymene from Nutmeg-terpene Dibromide. This cymene, of course, also

contained the cymene which preexisted in the hydrocarbon used ; the pre-
existing cymene was about 10-12 per cent, whilst the total cymene obtained

was 55 per cent, of the hydrocarbon used.
   The following were the physical characteristics of these specimens :

in various cases, some light might be thrown on this question ; but unfortu-

nately this appears to be impracticable.

    With a view to obtaining another variety of cymciic for comparison with
the above, some experiments were made with citronella-oil, which was found
by Gladstone to contain a substance boiling at 199°-20o°, and agreeing in
composition with the formula Cjj,HjgO ; it was expected that this body would
behave like myristicol on treatment with zinc chloride or phosphorus penta-
chloride. On examining about GOO grams of pure oil of citronella obtained
from Messrs. Piesse and Lubin, however, no quantity of this constituent
could be isolated ; the great majority of the oil is made up of a substance
which agrees tolerably accurately with the formula Cj^Hj^O, and boils at near
210° ; the action of heat on this substance, however, alters it, converting it
into substances of higher boiling-point, and finally into a resin not volatile at
the limits of the mercurial thermometer : this resin appears to be a polymeride
of Cj^HjgO minus the elements of a portion of water.

   The examination of the citronella products is not yet complete, and the
account of them is therefore deferred untU next year ; the following points,
however, appear to be made out.

   By the action of zinc chloride the body C,uH|^0 splits up partially into

water and a hydrocarbon, or mixture of hydrocarbons, boiling between 170°
and 180°, and approximating to the formula Cj^H^^ ; so that apparently the
action is mainly

                                      C.,,H,,0=H,0+C,,,H,,.

A large quantity of a resinous body which approximates to the composition

(C,,,H|^,),, is simultaneously formed.

   By the additiim of two equivalents of bromine to the body C,,,1I,^0 heat is

developed; on distillation of the resulting brominated liquid (which does not
crystallize on standing) it breaks up into water, hydrobromic acid, and a
hydrocarbon which appears to bo cymene, formed thus

                      C'A,0 + Br, = C,,,H,,,Br,0,

                               C\,,H,,Br,0=H,0+2HBr+C,,,H,,.

   It is proposed to contiuue these researches in whatever direction may seem

most promising for the fulfilment of the object in view, viz. the obtaining of
additional knowledge on the subject of isomerism in tho terpene series and
their derivatives. The strong tendency of most of these substances to poly-
merize and alter, forming resinous uon-volatile masses, renders working on this
subject somewhat difficult, large quantities of raw material being I'equisite in
order to obtain sufficient of any given derivative to submit it to careful study.

From wliat has been already done, together with the results obtained by

Baeyer, Oppenheim, Kekuld, Barbier, &c., it appears that the constituents of
the " Essential Oils " (wliich are most frequently either terpenes or deriva-
tives from terpenes) are intimately connected with the benzene series of
hydrocarbons ; it is proposed to study these connexions more minutely
wherever practicable.

                                                      Appendix.

   Further experiments, made since the above Report was written, have con-
firmed the formula C,^,H,^0 as that of the main constituent of the sample of
citroneUa-oil examined phosjihorus sulphide acts on this substance just as

                                                                                                                      ;

to bo identical with that obtained from the eight sources described in the

above Report.

   The main constituent of oil of wormwood (termed by Gladstone Ahsintlwl,
and indicated by the formula Cj,,Hj|.0), when treated with zinc chloride or
phosphorus sulphide, splits up in exactly the same way as its isomcrides

myristicol and camphor, water and cymene being formed, thus,

the cymene thus formed is identical with that obtained from the other sources
examined. The action of phosphorus sulphide also gives rise to the produc-
tion of a sulphuretted compound apparently identical with the (hiocpnene,
C,(,IIj3 . SH, recently obtained by Flesch from the products of the action of
phosphorus sulphide on camphor. Further details are postponed until next

year's Report.

   From the circumstance that different observers have frequently obtained

different results in the examination of certain kinds of essential oils (e. g. the
different properties and compositions of myristicol and the oxidized consti-
tuent of citronella-oil found by Gladstone and by the writer), it would seem
that the composition of such oils is subject to variation, probably with the

age of the plant, the season, climate, &c.

RejJort of the Committee, coyisisting of W. Chandler Roberts, Dr.
   Mills, Dr. Boycott, and A. W. Gadesden, appointed for the pur-

  pose of inquiring into the Method of making Gold-assays, and of

  stating the Results thereof Drawn up by W. Chandler Roberts,

    Secreta}-y.

The attention of the Committee was first directed to a series of experiments
instituted with a view to ascertain to what extent the weights of pieces of
pure gold would be affected by submitting them to the process of assaying,
and consequently how far the results of assay operations are trustworthy.

   These results showed* that the maximum error in no case exceeded one

hundredth per cent, of the original weight of the assay piece, and conse-

quently that the results obtained by assaying gold represent the composition of

--the portions of metal under examination to the j^jj^ part a fact which will

doubtless appear remarkable to all who are accustomed to the ordinary

methods of quantitative analysis.

   The Committee are not unmindful that, although it is possible to attain this
high degree of accuracy, it is nevertheless well known that a comparison of
the assay repoi'ts of different assayers as to the composition of the same

ingot often discloses discrepancies of ^^~ parts. Thus portions of metal

from nineteen gold ingots were assayed by the Mint Assayerf, and were

then sent to five assayers, each of whom furnished an independent report.

Two assayers alone agreed as to the value of fifteen of these ingots ; in

the ease of three ingots, three assayers were in accordance, while in one

instance all the assay reports differed ; and viewing the reports generally,

^^ --^the discrepancies varied from
                       to ~-^, or an average deviation of

parts.

        * Appendix I.  t Appendix II.
--220 REPORT 1873.

    These small variations assume serious proportions -when they affect the

value of large quantities of bullion ; for instance, the value of gold coined at

the Mint during the past year -was £15,200,000, and a persistent error in

the assay reports of only ^^^ part would have been attended -with a gain or

loss to the Department of no less than ^£1500.
    The Committee hojie that their labours -will ultimately result in a clear

definition of the conditions under -which errors arise.
    The method of gold-assaying, as practised in the Mint, is given in the

Appendix*; and this method, kno-wn as the parting assay, has been de-
liberately adopted by all assayers, -with slight variations of manipulation,
which have not as j'et been minutely examined, as the Committee considered
that when -widely divergent results are obtained the gold employed by one or
other of the assayers as " check pieces " is impure, and that either the amount
of impurity has not been ascertained -with accuracy, or it altogether escapes
detection. It foUo-ws, therefore, that the -weight of the check " cornets," -when
compared with the initial weight of the portion of metal operated upon, ap-
pears to indicate the presence of an amount of gold which is in excess of
the true amount of precious metal present in the alloy.

    The Committee obtained specimens of gold from different sources*, and
tested them side by side with gold prepared, in accordance with the direc-
tions of the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, by the Chemist
of the Mint for use as trial-plate for testing the coinage.

    Great care was taken in the preparation of this gold, 80 ounces of which
were precipitated from 100 gallons of chloride of gold ; and as experiments
have already shown that it is very pure, the Committee propose to adopt it
as the basis for a new series of comparisons, and, further, to invite assayers

to submit samples of the gold used by them in order that they may be

tested side by side with this standard plate.

the gold. It is necessary therefore to make check assays on pure gold or on

standards of known composition, upon which the accuracy of the result will

in a great measure depend.

weight of the assay piece operated upon ; and therefore the amount of gold

present in the alloy is at once indicated without further calculation.

First Report of the Committee for the Selection and Nomenclature of
   Dynamical and Electrical tlnits, the Committee consisting of Sir

  W. Thomson, Professor G. C. Foster, Professor J. C. Maxwell,

   Mr. G. J. Stoney, Professor Fleeming Jenkin, Dr. Siemens, Mr.
   F. J. Bramwell, and Professor Everett (Reporter).

We consider that the most urgent portion of the task intrusted to us is that

which concerns the selection and nomenclature of units of force and energy

and under this head we are prepared to offer a definite recommendation.

  A more extensive and difficult part of our duty is the selection and nomen-

clature of electrical and magnetic units. Under this head we are prepared with

a definite recommendation as regards selection, but with only an interim

recommendation as regards nomenclature.
   ON DYNAMICAL AND ELECTRICAL UNITS.                                      223

      Up to the present time it has been necessary for every person who wishes

   to specify a magnitude in what is called " absolute " measure, to mention the

   three fundamental units of mass, length, and time which he has chosen as

   the basis of his sj'stcm. This necessity will be obviated if one definite selec-

   tion of three fundamental units be made once for all, and accepted by the

   Wegeneral consent of scientific men.  are strongly of opinion that such a

   selection ought at once to bo made, and to be so made that there will be no

   subsequent necessity for amending it.

     We think that, in the selection of each kind of derived unit, all arbitrary

   multiplications and divisions by i)owers of ten, or other factors, must be

   rigorously avoided, and the whole system of fundamental units of force, work,

   electrostatic, and electromagnetic elements must be fixed at one common

   --level that level, namely, which is determined by direct derivation from the

   three fundamental units once for all selected.

   The carrying out of this resolution involves the adoption of some units which

   are excessively large or excessively small in comparison with the magnitudes

   which occur in practice ; but a remedy for this inconvenience is provided
   by a method of denoting decimal multiples and submultiples, which has

   already been extensively adopted, and which we desire to recommend for

   general use.

      On the initial question of the particular units of mass, length, and time to

   be recommended as the basis of the whole system, a protracted discussion has

   been carried on, the principal point discussed being the claims of the gramme,

   --the metre, and the second, as against the gramme, the centimetre, and the

   second, the former combination having an advantage as regards the simpli-

   city of the name metre, while the latter combination has the advantage of

   --making the unit of mass practically identical with the mass of unit-volume

   of water in other words, of making the value of the density of water prac-

   Wetically equal to unity.  are now all but unanimous in regarding this latter

   clement of simplicity as the more important of the two ; and in support of

   this view we desire to quote the authority of Sir W. Thomson, who has for a

   long time insisted very strongly upon the necessity of employing units which

   conform to this condition.

     We accordingly recommend the general adoption of the Centimetre, the

   Gramme, and the Second as the three fundamental units ; and until such time
   as special names shall be appropriated to the units of electrical and magnetic
   magnitude hence derived, we recommend that they be distinguished from

   " absolute " units otherwise derived, by the letters " C. G. S." prefixed, these

   being the initial letters of the names of the three fundamental units.

      Special names, if short and suitable, would, in the opinion of a majoritj' of
   \\s, be better than the provisional designations " C. G. S. unit of . . . ."

   Sevei-al lists of names have already been suggested ; and attentive considera-

   tion will be given to any further suggestions which we may receive from

   persons interested in electrical nomenclature.

      Tlie " ohm,'' as represented by the original standard coil, is approximately

   lU' C. G. S. units of resistance; the "volt" is approximately IC C. G. S.

   units of electromotive force ; and the " farad " is approximately |^^ of the

   C. G. S. unit of capacity.

      For the expression of high decimal multiples and submultiples, we recom-
   mend the system introduced by Mr. Stoney, a system which has already

   been extensively employed for electrical purposes. It consists in denoting
   the exponent of the power of 10, which serves as multiplier, by an appended

I
                                                                                    --

cardinal number, if the exponent be positive, and by a prefixed ordinal
number if the exponent be negative.

Thus  10"  grammes  constitute  a  gramme-nine                                      ^^^ of a gramme constitutes
                                                                                 ;

a ninth-gramme ; the approximate length of a quadrant of one of the earth's

meridians is a metre-seven, or a centimetre-nine.

    For multiplication or division by a million, the prefixes mer/a * and micro

may conveniently be employed, according to the present custom of electricians.
Thus the megohm is a million ohms, and the microfarad is the millionth part
of a farad. The prefix mega is equivalent to the affix six. The prefix micro

is equivalent to the prefix sixth.

    The prefixes hilo, hecto, deca, deci, centi, milVi can also be employed in their
usual senses before all new names of units.

   As regards the name to be given to the C. G. S. xm.it of force, we recom-
mend that it be a derivative of the Greek Zvi a ins. The form dynamy appear*
to be the most satisfactory to etymologists. Dynam is equally intelligible,
but awkward in sound to English ears. The shorter form, dyjie, though not

fashioned according to strict rules of etymology, will probably be generally

preferred in this country. Bearing in mind that it is desirable to construct
a system with a view to its becoming international, we think that the termi-
nation of the word should for the present be left an open question. But we
would earnestly request that, whichever form of the word be employed, its.

--meaning be strictly limited to the unit of force of the C. G. S. system that

is to say, the force which, acting tqjon a gramme of matter for a second, gene-

rates a velocitif of a centimetre per second.
    The C. G. S. unit of ivork is the work done by this force worJcing through a

centimetre ; and we propose to denote it by some derivative of the Greek
epyoi'. The forms ergon, ergal, and erg have been suggested ; but the second
of these has been used in a difi'erent sense by Clausius. In this case also wc
propose, for the present, to leave the termination unsettled ; and we request

that the word ergon, or erg, be strictly limited to the C. G. S. unit of work,
or what is, for purposes of measurement, equivalent to this, the C. G. S. unit
of energy, energy being measured by the amount of work which it represents.

    The C. G. S. unit ofpower is the power of doing work at the rate of one er(j
per second ; and the power of an engine, under given conditions of working,
can be sjiecified in ergs per second.

    For rough comparison with the vulgar (and variable ) units based on ter-

restrial gravitation, the following statement will be useful :

    The iveight of a gramme, at any part of the earth's surface, is about 980

dynes, or rather less than a kilodyne.

    The iveight of a hilogramme is rather less than a megadyne, being about
980,000 dynes.

    Conversely, the dyne is about 1-02 times the weight of a milligramme at
any part of the earth's surface; and the megadyne is about 1"02 times the

weight of a Icilogramme.

    The lilogrammetre is rather less than the ergon-eight, being about 98

million ergs.

    The gramme-centimetre is rather less than the KZer^, being about 980 ergs.
    For exact comparison, the value of r; (the acceleration of a body falling in
vacuo) at the station considered must of course be known. In the above
comparisons it is taken as 980 C. G. S. units of acceleration.

   * Before a Towel, either viey or mcgal, as euphony may suggest, may be employed

instead of mega.

   One horse-power is about three quarters of an erg-ten per second. More
nearly, it is 7"46 erg-nines per second ; and one force-de-cheval is 7*36 erg-nines

per second.

41-6 megalergs, or 41,600,000 ergs.

   Mr. Stoney has requested the insertion of the following extract from one
of his letters, written subsequently to the presentation of the foregoing
Report :

   " Would you oblige me very much by putting on record, either in the

Report or as a footnote to it, that the centimetre was recommended as the

unit of length against my earnest remonstrance, and that I am in no degree

responsible for this decision. I would be glad to have the objections I urged
against it stated also. They were, ' that it is far too small, and that its mul-

tiples and submultiples cannot bo briefly designated. From its being too
small, it, in conjunction with the gramme and second, lands us in quite

--out-of-the-way mechanical units the unit of force which results being but

Httle more than the pressure of a milligramme, and the unit of work being
but little more than the hundredthousandth part of a grammetre. This
I deem a very serious objection.'

   ·' I sttU thinlc that these awkward consequences, and the footing which
the metre has already gained in science, will prove fatal to the recommenda-
tion of the Committee, and that experience will show that the metre must in

the end be accepted as the standard unit of length."

examined all the more important examples of Labyrinthodonts in European

collections, including at least one example of every species recorded from the

British Isles. They desire to thank many private collectors and officers of

public museums for facilities afforded.

species is in progress ; meanwhile the Committee offer a preliminarj- sketch

    The Skull {general). The general figure of the skull varies greatly in this

order. It is usually triangular, with a rounded anterior end, and a concave

posterior border, but may be oval, parabolic, pyriform, or hexagonal. In

one species of Archegosaurus (A. Dechen'i) it is greatly produced, so that the

length exceeds twice the breadth. Jtlore commonly the greatest breadth is

nearly equal to the length. In Braclvjops the greatest breadth is rather

more than the length. The upper and lower surfaces of the cranium are

usually crushed flat. Rarely, as in the single skuU of Zygosaurus and in

one example of Loxomma, is the original contour preserved.

226 REPORT--1873.

   The following bones have been identified in the sknlls of Labyrin-

thodonts :

   Premaxillaries (one or two).  Supratemporals (two).
   MaxiUaries (two).             Quadrato-jugals (two).
   Nasals (two).                 Snpraoccipitals (one or two).
   Lachrymals (two).             Exoccipitals (two).
   Frontals (two).               Parasphenoid.
   Prefrontals (two).            Pterygoids (two).
   Postfrontals (two).           Palatals (two).
   Postorbitals (two).
   Jugals (two).                 Vomers (two).
   Parietals (two).
   Squamosals (two).             Quadrates (two).
   Epiotics (two).               Mandible (each ramus consisting

                                     normally of three pieces, viz.
                                     articular, angular, and dentary).

   There may thus be forty-seven distinct elements i)resent ; and this is appa-
rently the number in Lo.vomma (PL I.).

    In Trematosaurus the premaxillaries are nnited. According to Cope *

there is no quadrato-jugal in Pariostegm, but the maxillaries have a free

termination behind. Pteroplax appears, from at least three well-preserved

specimens, to have no maxillaries, resembling in this respect the recent

Siren ; it wants also the postero-lateral ossifications external to the level of

the orbits f. In Batracliiderpeton the maxiUaries are undoubtedly absent,

and the premaxillaries have a free posterior termination %. AH the well-

presei-ved mandibles hitherto examined have consisted of three pieces only

in each ramus. Burmeister has described six elements as present in a

shattered mandible of Trematosaurus § ; and Mr. Hancock records a splenial
piece in the mandible of Anthracosaurus ||. The jaw upon which this latter

determination is founded is fragmentary, and the internal plate in question

may prove to be part of the articular bone. At the time of the publication of
the ' Palaontologie Wiirtembergs,' Von Meyer seems to have attributed six man-

dibular elements to Mastodonsaurus (pp. 18, 25) ; but this is certainly erroneous.
Prof. Huxley spealcs of a splenial in Pachijgonia and Gonioghjptus.

   The general disposition of these bones is similar to that of the Crocodilian
skull. The resemblance is closer as regards the bones of the upper surface
than with respect to those which compose the palate, and it does not hold
good at all of the axial elements of the skull. The occipital and s])henoidal

ossifications diff'er essentially from those of the Crocodile or any other reptile.
   The superior surface of the skull is interrupted by five openings, viz. two

nasal apertures or external nares, two orbits, and a parietal foramen. The
apertures of the ears are situate at the junction of the superior and posterior

surfaces, adjacent to the epiotics. There are no lateral-temporal If or supra-
temporal fossse, as in CrocodiUa, nor any of the spaces unoccupied by bone
which, in addition to the nasal apertures and orbits, break up the roof of the
cranium in most existing Amphibia. {Dasyceps has a " facial fontanelle "«*.)

           ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE LADYRINTHODONTS.                 237

The posterior or occipital surface is more or less vertical. It may present

an occipital foramen, a pair of occipital condyles, the apertures of the ears,

which are directed backwards, and the large openings of the palato-temporal

or pterygoid fossae. On each side of the occipital bones there may project

horizontally backwards the postero -internal or epiotic cornua. The articular

surface for the lower jaw forms the external and inferior angle, when it is

well preserved. It appears to have been often in great part cartilaginous.

AThe inferior or palatal surface of the cranium is rarely exposed.  para-

sphenoid, as in Teleostean and Ganoid fishes and recent Amphibia, extends

forwards from the occipital region, and passes into a rostrum or processus

cultriformis in front. The posterior part of the parasphenoid is usually ex-

panded, and presents lateral wings which are continuous with the pterygo-

palatine processes. The palatine foramina, which are oval and usually of

large size, are separated from each other by the processus cultriformis, or by

Athis and the vomers together.  transverse bridge of bone, consisting of a

pterygoid, or of a pterygoid and a palatal, divides the palatine foramen from

Athe palato-temporal fossa.  narrow slip, furnished by the maxilla, and

containing a row of teeth, lies along the outer edge of the mouth, and has

the elongated palatal on its inner side as far forwards as the posterior nares.

There are a pair of vomers, as in recent Amphibia. Like the palatals, they bear

teeth. The posterior nares are oval or rounded apertures, varying a good

deal in position. In Trematosaurus * they lie between the palatal, vomer,

and maxiUa, towards the fore part of the snout. In Anthracosaurus they

are placed much further back, though probably bounded by the same bones.

The longitudinal distance between the external and posterior nares may be

considerable, as in Labyrinthodonf, or very short, as in DasycepsX- The

latter genus must have had nearly vertical nasal passages, like recent Batra-

chia. In no Labyrinthodont is the prolongation backwards of the nasal

Apassages at all comparable to that which obtains in Crocodilia.  pair of

cavities lying in or adjacent to the premaxillaries may represent pits for the

reception of mandibular tusks, or spaces occupied by membrane. The first

explanation was proposed by Burmeister in his remarks on Trematosaurus

but Yon Meyer observes that the apertures do not in all species of Labyrin-

thodonta correspond with the position of the large teeth of the mandible. If

this supposition be rejected, Ave must regard the apertures as anterior palatine

foramina.

The subcutaneous surface of the cranial bones is ordinarily sculptured.

This sculpture may take the form of pits arranged in each bone round the

centre of ossification. The pits sometimes pass into grooves towards the

margin of the bone, and are then placed radially, all the grooves pointing

towards one centre, which does not, however, in the adult necessarily, or

indeed usually, occupy the middle point of the bone. The skuU of Loxomma

has a honeycomb surface ; and in Hylonomus^ the cranial bones are smooth.

Besides these local systems of pits or grooves, a series of more continuous

" mucous canals " is seen in some genera, taking the form of semicylindrical

grooves which pass from before to behind along the face. These canals vary

much as to their extent and prominence. They may be confined to the

muzzle, or may be found in the temporal and maxillary regions also. They

are usually visible between and in front of the orbits, approaching each other

in the interorbital space, and receding from each other over the parietal

tract. Sometimes they are seen to converge once more towards the anterior

or external nares, completing thus the figure of a lyre, wliich they have been

thought to resemble. They become deeper and more defined with age.

In Trematosaunis, Bncmeister* distinguishes frontal, malar, and maxillary

canals (" Stirn-, Backen-, und Mundrand-Furchen ''). The frontal canals are

first conspicuous between the anterior nasal apertures, running parallel to

each other at this point. They pass in diverging curves backwards across

the snout, are approximated towards the orbits, immediately behind which

they diverge again, and then terminate. The malar canals are somewhat

broader. They pass forwards from the aperture of the ear to the centre of

the postorbital, curve downwards to near the angle of the mouth, where they

touch the maxillary canals, and then take a nearly straight course across

the jugal and supratemporal to the posterior margin of the skull. The

maxillary canals are faintly marked at tlieir origin near the tip of the

snout, but become gradually broader and deeper. They rise a little upon

the side of the skull halfway between the nasal apertures and the orbits,

but are contiguous to the edge of the mouth throughout the rest of their

course. They disappear gradually near the angle of the mouth. The mucous

canals of Mastodonsaurns are very similar, but the lyra is more dilated and

more regularly oval. In Oonioglyptus-\ the facial canals are strongly angu-

lated, curving outwards and forwards from the interorbital space, and then

suddenly becoming parallel.

In Archegosaurus the mucous canals are visible only in the large skulls.

They are distinct along the inner border of the orbit, passing thence for-

wards upon the prefrontal, and backwards upon the postfroutal and supra-

temporal. Burmcisters restoration J seems to exhibit the canals too pro-
minently upon the prcorbital part of the face.

   In Loxomma the canals pass in simple curves from the inner borders of

the orbits to the posterior external angles of the premaxillaries, and are

united in front by a slightly curved canal which runs along the free border

Aof the pi-emaxillaries above the alveolus.  short maxillary canal is pre-

sent in this genus.

Tlie skulls of Crocodilia agree with those of the Labyrinthodonts in having

a pitted sculpture, though in the former order the pits and grooves are not

usually radiate. Mucous canals are not found in Crocodilia. Both kinds

of sculpture are, in all jirobalfility, related to the nutrition of the cutis.

   The crania] bones (witli the exception of the quadrate and parts of the
occipital segment in many Carboniferous Labyrinthodonts) are fully ossified,

and this from the time that the animal leaves the shell. As a rule, no inter-

spaces or fontanelles are visible at any age§, though examples oi Archego-

saurus of embryonic size, in which the skull was not more than one twentieth

of the length of the adult state, have been examined with reference to this

point.

This mode of development of the skull is not confined to Labyrinthodonts.

AIn Crocodilia the same thing is observed.  recently hatched Crocodile pre-

sents no cranial interspaces or fontanelles. Not only are the sutures of the

Crocodilian skull closed before the end of embryonic life, but the frontals and

parietals, originally i^aircd bones, are respectively united at that early period.
This rapid formation of a solid and compactly articulated skull does not pre-

clude tho further growth of every separate bone. In both Crocodiha and

Labyrinthodonts the skull ultimately becomes many times as large as it was

at birth, retaining all the time its accurately closed sutures, and increasing
by additions to all tho borders of each ossification. The growth of the Cro-

codilian skull appears to be quite indefinite, ending only with the life of the

individual                                                      and the same may have been true of  the Labyrinthodont.  This

mode of enlargement is compatible with great progressive changes in the

proportions of the skull. In Crocodilia and Labyrinthodonts alike, the face

increases more rapidly than the brain- case ; so that the orbits may recede

from near the centre to the junction of the posterior and middle thirds of the

--skull. This is the case, for example, with Archegosaurus Decheni.
   All these peculiarities of the skull the early 'ossification and junction by

suture of the cranial bones, their indefinite or, at least, protracted growth, the

generally persistent sutures which are implied thereby, the ever- increasing

ratio of the entire skull to the chamber in which the brain is lodged, and,

--lastly, the pitted sculpture of the subcutaneous surfaces are interesting

points of physiological resemblance between the Labyrinthodonts and Cro-

codilia                               but                       they are  too directly associated with mode of life and external
                                   ;

conditions to support any argument as to zoological aflinity.

   The orbits vary much as to size, position, and form. In Loxomma they

are -36 of the length of the skull along the middle line ; in Basyeeps not
more than -1. In Mctoinns they lie in the anterior half of the skull; in

Mastodonsaurus they are nearly central; in Capitosaurus they lie in the

posterior half. As to form, they may be round, oval, elliptical, or irregular.

In Pterojylax and Batt-achiderpeton the outer bony wall (at least) of the orbit
seems to be deficient.

The interorbital space and the external nasal apertures are equally variable.
The Occijntal Segtneiit.--It is to he regretted that the occipital region of

the Labyrinthodonts, especially of the Carboniferous genera, is so imperfectly

known. No part of the skuU would yield characters of greater zoological

siguificance were its structure fully revealed. In most of the Carboniferous

examples examined nothing is shown of the occipital segment, except one or
two supraoccipital plates. The deficiency of occipital condyles in Archetjo-
saurus, of which many singularly perfect specimens have occurred, seems to
show that, like the vcrtebilil centra of that genus, they were never ossified,

but remained cartilaginous throughout hfe. Loxomma, on the contrary,
which has well-ossified centra, has also ossified condyles ; they are small,
very convex, and closely approximated. In the Triassic Labyrinthodonts the

occipital region was fully ossified; and these are our best guides to the

structure of the occipital segment in the whole order. Even in the Triassic

species the basioccipital is concealed by a parasphenoid, and the form of the

occiput, with its numerous cavities and processes, is not favourable to the

complete preservation of details.

The boundaries of the component parts of the occipital segment have in no

case been traced. It is probable that in the Mastodonsauria (e. g. Tremato-

saurus) a pair of exoccipitals surrounded the foramen magnum*, and sup-

ported the occipital condyles, that a cartilaginous supraoccipital, ultimately

replaced by a pair of membrane-bones, surmounted the segmetot, and that in

the basioccipital tract the cartilaginous primordial skull was never ossified,

but was underlain and finally absorbed by the parasphenoid plate. In

                                                                          * Burincister, Tronatosaums, p. 24.
330 REPORT-- 1873.

Archegosaurus the elements of the occipital segment proper may have been

persistently cartilaginous, except so far as they were encroached upon by the

supraoccipital and parasphenoid ossifications. The condyles were most

probably entirely cartilaginous. Professor Owen* supposes that " the head

was connected by ligament, as in Protopteri, to the vertebral column of the

trunk, and chiefly by the basioccipital part."

The existence of two lateral occipital condyles in this order is a feature of

great morphological importance and zoological value. If, as Yon Meyer and
many other writers have supposed, the Labyrinthodonts are tnie ReptUia, they

constitute the one exception to the rule that in each of the four higher classes

of Vertebrata the number of occipital condyles is constant.

  --The Parasphenoid (sphenoideum of Von Meyer t and BurmeisterJ). In

Trematosaurus a large undivided bone underlies the base of the cranium,

giving off on either side a postero-lateral process which joins the suspensorial

peduncle. In front it passes into a rostrum or processus culfriformis, which

separates the palatine foramina, and articulates in front with the vomers.

Between the postero-lateral and the cultriform processes there is on each side

a broad outstanding extension of the parasphenoid, which joins the pterygoid,

and, together with that bone, separates the palatine foramen from the palato-

temporal fossa§. Burmeister describes lateral ascending processes of the

bone as passing upwards to join the margins of the parietals on the under-

side of the cranial roof and extending forwards to about the level of the

parietal foramen ||. The parasphenoid of Mastodonsaurus has in general the
same form and relations.

   In Archegosaurus a similar bone is found, but so displaced that its con-

--nexions cannot be accurately made out. It is of spatulate form the posterior

end being dilated and of rounded triangular or polygonal outline, whUe the

anterior end is extended into a long slender processus cultriformis. The ex-

panded end is often displaced backwards so as to project beyond the base of

the skull. The connexions of this bone with the pterygoid are shown in one

of the examples figured by Von Meyer %. Its position with respect to the

palatine foramen and the palato-temporal fossa appears to have been much

the same as in  Trematosaurus                                                               but  there  is  no  trace  of  any postero-lateral
                                                                                         ;

process given off to join the quadrate. That bone has not, indeed, been

identified in any specimen of Archegosaurus ; nor is the mandibular articula-
tion known in this genus**. The fore part of the parasphenoid of Anthraco-

saurus is known ft. It agrees in aU essential point* with that of Archegosaurus.
Prof. Owen has figured a detached parasphenoid of Dendrerpeton associated

with other bones ; but no mention is made of it in the text JJ.
   In Loxomma the upper surface of the parasphenoid has been examined.

About an inch in advance of the spheuo-occipital suture are two broken

processes g of an inch apart, which are directed towards the parietal bones.
Again in advance is a strong median ridge, extending as far as the anterior

third of the palatine foramen, which may have supported an interorbital

septum.                                                                                          ,

skull is homologous with the parasphenoid of recent Teleostean Fishes,

Ganoids, and Amphibia*.
--AThe Pteri/(/oid.
                         pterygoid element may be recognized in a bone which

is found to he contiguous to the parasphenoid of Archegosaurus in several

examples f. The two bones are shown but little disturbed in plate v. fig. 7
of Von Meyer's great work. In Trematosaurns the boundaries of the bone

have not been traced, though its position is not doubtfulj. The pteiygoids

of Mastodonsaurus, Metopias, and others, are known in the same way.

In Archegosaurus, as pi'obably in all Labyrinthodonts, the Amphibian plan

of structure prevails in the pterygoid region. There are two pterygoids ; and
these are nowhere in contact, but are separated by the parasphenoid. Each

pterygoid has a broad surface which divides the palatine foramen in front

from the palato-temporal fossa behind, passing transversely, but somewhat

obhquely, from the parasphenoid internally to the palatal on the outer side.

In addition to this transverse plate there is in Arcliegosaurus, BatracMderpeton,

and Loxomma, at least, a long slender process, which is continued forwards

along the outer margin of the palatine foramen ; its anterior termination is

unknown.

 --The Palatal. The lower surface of the palatal presents the form of a long

and narrow slip interposed between the maxilla and the produced anterior

part of the pterygoid. Its boundaries have not been accurately traced in any

Labyrinthodont ; but it appears to reach the vomer in front, and to form part

of the boundary of the posterior nasal aperture, whUe behind it may help to

bound the palato-temporal fossa. The palatal usually bears a series of teeth,

which increase in size from the ordinary size of maxillary teeth behind to

large tusks in front §.

In recent Batrachia the palatal is transverse, dividing the palatine from

the posterior nasal foramina ; but in Gymnophiona it closes the posterior

nares behind, and then extends backwards along the inner side of the maxUla,

--as in Labyrinthodonts !|.
    The Vomer. In Labyrinthodonts (as in Crocodilia, Lacertilia, Ophidia,

and all recent Amphibia, excepting a few Batrachia^), the vomer is

double. It is usually bounded by the premaxillaries in front, by the

maxilla, posterior nasal aperture, and end of the palatal externally, and

along the middle hne by its fellow of the opposite side. The posterior

margin appears to be usually connected with the 2'>^ocessus cultriformis

mesially, and with the palatal on the outer side ; while between these
points it forms part of the anterior boundary of the palatal foramen. The

vomer in Labyrinthodonts is of great proportionate breadth, forming an

unusually large part of the bony palate.

  A row of vomerine teeth of varying number, some of which are of large

size, is disposed longitudinally along the bone in Trematosaurus, Arrhego-

saurus, and Anthracosmirus. In Lahjrinthodon this longitudinal row

terminates in front with a large tusk, which is at the same time the

outermost of a short transverse series*.

In the remarkable genus Batrachiderpetonf a very different type of

palatal structure is presented. Here the vomers form a pair of large,

somewhat triangular plates, which support the premaxillaries in front, and

Apass to the pterygoids on either side behind.                                                     large central tract of the

vomerine surface is thickly covered with minute conical teetli, while the outer

margin of what is apparently the same bone bears a series of ten or more

stronger compressed teeth J. The structure here described is most nearly
paralleled b}' the Perennibranchiate Amphibia and by certain fishes, the

--Carboniferous Mec/alichthys among the rest.
   The Premaxillavy. The premaxillary is usually double in Labyrin-

thodonts, but single in Trematosaurus\. Its proportions vary greatly

according to age and species.

   On the superior surface of the skull the premaxillary articulates with the

nasal and maxillary of the same side, and bounds in jDart the external nasal

aperture. On the palatal surface it is supported behind by the vomer and

ordinarily by the maxillary also. The row of maxillary teeth is continued

along the premaxillary border, in most cases without interniption or marked

difference in size. There may be eleven or more premaxillary teeth on each

side ; the number is not constant beyond the limits of the species.

Elliptical cavities have been observed upon the under surface of the

premaxillary ; and these have been compared to the dental pits of Alligator

by Eurmeister, who supposes that they received the large mandibular teeth ||.

This view harmonizes well Avith the structure of Trematosaurus, in which

there are large tusks internal to the serial mandibular teeth. In Archego-

saurus, however, there are no tusks in the mandible, yet the cavities in the

palatal plate of the prasmaxilla are plainly visible. It is possible that these

apertures, as well as the similar one in Anthracosaurus, may have been
vacuities occupied in the living animal by membrane^.

   The premaxillary of Batraclndeiyeton appears to differ essentially from
the bone as it exists in other Labyrinthodonts. It is produced outwards for
a short distance beyond the end of the series of teeth, and appears to have
terminated in a free point unconnected with a maxilla, as in Mcnohranclms,

--Siren, and Proteus.
    The Maxilla. The maxilla in Labyrinthodonts takes the form of a long
narrow slip of bone, comprising nearly all the marginal alveoli of the teeth

and but little else. It usually extends ou either side from the premaxillary
to the angle of the mouth, and is in contact with the quadrato-jugal behind.

In front, and upon the upper surface of the skull, the maxilla may be some-

what expanded so as to occupy an obtuse angle bounded by the nasal and

lachrymal. It generally adjoins the external nasal apertlirc for a greater or

less distance ; and its internal facial border is successively contiguous to the

nasal, lachrymal, and jugal. Upon the inferior or palatal surface it may

reach forwards to the posterior nasal foramen, or be excluded therefrom by

the junction of the palatal and vomer. No palatine plate of appreciable

breadth is developed ; and the maxillae of opposite sides are nowhere

in contact.

   Batracliiderpeton &i\A Pteroplax have no maxillaj ; and Pariostegus may have

had imperfect maxillae ending behind in a free point, as in SaJamandra &c.
   The maxillary teeth are usually of small size, and form a regular series,

diminishing slightly towards the angle of the mouth. The number in
Archegosaurus is upwards of thirty ; and the gaps represent about as many
moi'e. In Baplietes and Lahyrinthodon there are anterior maxillary tusks,
while in AntJiracosaurus both the premaxillary and two or more of the
anterior maxillary teeth are of unusual size and strength, almost equalling

--the vomerine and palatine tusks.
    The Nasal. The nasal bones are double in this order. They bound the
external nasal apertures behind, and extend backwards to join the
froutals. In front, where they are contiguous to the maxilla or are inter-
posed between the maxiUa and the premaxillary, they are broadest, whUe
they gradually contract backwards in proportion to the increasing breadth of

the lachrymal.
    Like all the bones of the face, not only in Labyriuthodonts but in

Vertebrata generally, the nasals become longer and longer relatively to the
brain-case as age advances. This is notably the case with long-snouted
animals, such as the Crocodilia, and is most apparent in those species of
Labyriuthodonts which have elongated skulls (e. g. Archegosaurus Decheni).
The facial bones of Labyriuthodonts, and particularly the nasals, are as a rule
unsymmetiical and variable in form. This is another peculiarity of much-pro-
duced skulls ; it is exemplified by Ichthyosauria and by Crocodilia, especially
old individuals of Crocodilus intermedins and Rhynclwsuchus Schlegelii.

    TJie Lac7iri/)nal.-*-'W'hen present, the lachrymal lies anterior to the jugal

it is bounded by the maxUla on the outer side, and by the nasal and
prefrontal internally. In Trematosaurus Burmeister represents it as reach-
ing the orbit : but in reality it is excluded therefrom by the junction of the
prefrontal and jugal, as in most other Labyriuthodonts.

  --The Frontal, Prefrontal, and Postfrontal. Three sets of frontal ossifica-

tions are normally present, viz. a pair of frontals proper, which lie between
the nasals and the parietals in the median or coronal series, and on each side
of the head a prefrontal and a postfroutal, which bound respectively the
anterior and posterior part of the inner margins of the orbits. The prefrontal
and postfrontal generally unite to exclude the frontal proper from the orbit.

Externally the prefrontal is, as usual, adjacent to the lachrymal when that

bone is present.
   The frontals increase more rapidly in length than in breadth as age

advances ; but the relative change is not so marked as in the case of the
nasals. It is most apparent in those species which have, when adxdt, a much-
produced snout. The frontals are always more or less unsymmetrical.

applicable in great part to the lower Vertebrates generally. The CroeodiHa
and the Ganoid fishes agree well with the typical arrangement ; but in
the latter order other ossifications are intercalated, especially around the
orbit. In Crocodilia the postorbital and supratemporal are wanting, the
lateral temporal fossa occupying their place, and the epiotic is not externally
visible. The postorbitals and supratemporals are not found in any existing
Amphibian.

--The Parietal. In all Labyrinthodonts the parietals are paired bones,

occupying the normal position between the suj^raoccipitals and the frontals.

The most striking peculiarity which they present is perhaps the parietal

foramen, an oval or circular cavity of small size, lying in the interparietal

Asuture.  parietal foramen is known to exist in all the genera in which the

parietal bones are sufficiently weU preserved to determine the point. As the

parietals lengthen with age, the foramen is placed further and further back

in the interparietal suture. This is weU exemplified by Archegosaurus

Decheni, a species with a much elongated skull, of which an extensive suite

of specimens, difi"erii]g greatly in age, can be compared. It is relatively large

in Zygosaurus, and very small in Mastodonsaurus.      It is present in

  A parietal foramen is unknown in recent Amphibia*.

Ichthyosauria, Plesiosauria, and many Lacertilia.

In Batrachklerpeton the parietal, occipital, and some other adjacent bones

are defined by strong raised lines. In this genus the parietals extend

unusually far forwards.

   The underside of the coronal bones is sometimes smooth {Mastodonsaurus)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

it may present ridges which pass in pairs forwards and backwards from near

the parietal foramen. The anterior pair run nearly parallel ; but the posterior

j)air generally diverge rapidly. This aspect of the coronal bones as revealed

in a slab of coal-shale, has often a most deceptive resemblance to the para-

sphenoid of Ctenodus. The ridges probably indicate the lines of attachment

of vertical plates connecting the roof and floor of the skull. Tliat these
plates were in the Carboniferous Labyrinthodouts usually cartilaginous,
is shown by the complete flattening together of the two faces of bone in
nearly all the examples which have occurred *.
 . The Jugcd.--^^h.en present, the jugal intervenes between the maxilla and

the quadrato-jugal. Its relation to the outer side of the orbit is very
constant. The jugal is deficient in Pteroplax and BatracMderpeton, and

    The Suprutemporal and Postorhital. The presence of supratemporal and

postorbital bones is one of the distinctive features of the Labyrinthodont
skullf. In the recent Gymnophiona the lateral temporal fossaj do not exist
and the Labyrinthodonts are the only Amphibia, recent or fossil, in which

the fossa3 are closed by special ossifications. The supratemporal and post-

orbital are not uniformly present in this order.

   The " supratemporal foramen," described by Prof. Huxley as occurring in

Anthracosaurus, appears to be a small perforation in the supratem])oral bono.
It has no analogy with the supratemporal foramen or fossa of the Crocodilia.

--Mhinosaurus:!;: has a small round foramen at about the same place.
   The Squamosal. The relation of the squamosal to the external auditory
meatus renders it highly probable that the internal ear underlies this bone.

  A squamosal occurs in aU the genera of Labyrinthodonts which are accu-

--rately known, except in Pteroplax.
   The Epiotic. The pair of membrane-bones named " epiotic " by Prof.
Huxley are adjacent to the aperture of the ear and to the supraoccipital plates.
They are often pointed behind, like the corresponding ossifications of some
Teleostean and Ganoid fishes. Epiotic horns are present in Loxomma, Uro-
cordylus §, Pteroplax, Batrachiderpeton, and Keraterpeton. In the last-

mentioned genus they form great " postero-internal cornua," constituting
" about two sevenths of the extreme length of the skuU, and are pointed and
curved, so as to be slightly convex outwards ; their surfaces are rounded from
side to side, and longitudinally striated" ||.

   The aperture of the ear is adjacent to the epiotic, and usually indents the

--occipital or posterior border of the skull.
    The Quadraio-jugal. The quadrato-jugal is to be looked for at the postero-

external angle of the skull. In front it articulates with the jugal, and may
touch the maxilla. The degree of backward extension of the quadrato-jugal

varies greatly, according to the species and, in Archegosaurus, according to the

age of the individual.

   The outer surface is strongly marked with radiating sculpture. Little is
known of the under surface ; it was probably applied to the mandibular sus-

Mr. George Maw has a large skull of Loxomma which exhibits the original convexity of

the upper surface.

   t It has been stated (Eichwald, ' Bulletin de la Socilte des Naturalistes de Moscou,'
torn. XXI. 184:8) that Zygosaurus has lateral temporal fossa; ; but neither the descrijjtion

(p. 107) nor the plates (2, 3) render it quite clear what the structure of this part of the
skull really is. The original surface of the bones has been removed by fracture. It seems

probable that a broad groove for muscular attachment existed oti each side of the parietal

tract. There is a trace of the same structure in Loxomma. No postorbital aperture, like
that of the Crocodilia, is shown ; and the temporal region may have been composed of tlie

ossifications usual in Labyrinthodonts.

pensorium in great part, but may have fiirnislied points of origin to some of

the mandibular muscles.

The relations of the quadrate and quadrato-jugal have not been determined

accurately ; but there is little chance of error in supposing that the quadrato-

jugal represents a membrane-bone investing the mandibular suspensorium, of

which the quadrate, when jiresent, constitutes the ossified part. In some cases

at least (Masfodonsaunis, ArcJiegosaurus, Trematosaurus) the quadrato-jugal

--furnishes the outermost part of the articular surface for the mandible.
    The Quculrate. The quadrate of the Labyrinthodonts is as j^et very imper-

fectly known. In Trematosaurus, which has yielded the best materials for exa-

mination, it is described by Burmeister* as generally similar to the quadrate

of the Crocodile, and as contributing the two inner of three rounded depending

ridges for the articiilation of the mandible, the quadrato-jugal supplying the

outermost. No other important details have been distinctly made out.

   In Micropholis " the articular end, -^-^ of an inch broad, and flattened from

above downwards, exhibits a cond^doid surface, which is divided hy a groove

into a stronger internal and a less prominent external portion. In front of

the condyles the quadratum is very thin, but it rapidly expands so as to cover

all that remains of the flat lateral face of the suspensorium, and extends

forward to about midway between the articular condyle for the mandible and

the posterior margin of the orbit. At this point the bony matter disappears "f.
   The suspensorium has a downward and backward direction, as in the adult

Batrachia. It probably remained more or less cartilaginous in many of the

   Tlie Mandible. The rami of the mandible are long and straight, of con-

siderable vertical extent near the condyle, and gradually tapering forwards.

The upper and lower edges are nearly straight ; but in some genera there is a

low coronoid process, which rises as an elongated triangle from the upper

border, sloping very gradually in front, but rather more rapidly behind.

   Each ramus is made up of three elements f ; (I) a dentary bone, which
receives the teeth, and, in some cases, constitutes tlie upper half of the ramus

the slightly marked angle of the mandible, and is continued forwards along

the lower border, both on the inner and outer side, to near the sympliysis,

supporting the dcntaiy bone by a groove upon its iipper edge. The angular

bone is usually ornamented with a strong sculpture, radiating from the angle

itself. The articular element (3) comprises the condyle and the upper part
of the posterior end of the ramus. Its structure, as revealed by a fine

--example of the mandible of Anthracosaurus, is thus described by Jfessrs.

Hancock and Atthey : " The articular piece stands well up ; the neck is
short and stout ; the process bearing the glenoid surface is massive, and is

at the outer margin there ha» been        a  stout projecting                                                                                                                                                                  process                                       and in front

towards the inner margin there has been a similar projection of the Hp of the

articular cavity. It would therefore seem evident that the attachment of the

mandible to the tympanic trochlea must have been very firm, rendering the
movements of the jaw secure and precise " §. The glenoid cavity of Loxomma
is described by the same authors as " transversely elongated, deep, and con-

siderably elevated" ||. It has no postarticular process.

ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE LABYRINTH ODONTS.                      237

   The mandible of Mastodonscmrus has a strong in-n^ardlj projecting process,
which supports an extension of the glenoid cavity, and a well-developed post-

articular process of Crocodilian form and proportions.

   These differences might serve to arrange the Labyrinthodonts into two or
more groups. In Mastodonscmrus, Anthmcosaurus, Trematosaurus, &c. the

postarticular process is strong, and projects far backwards. In Archegosaurus

the process is short and comparatively weak ; it is wanting in Lo.vomma.
   Mere size will not explain these variations of structure. There is no ex-

traordinary difference of size of cranium among the genera mentioned ; and
Loxomma, which alone wants the postarticular process, is neither the largest

nor the smallest. But the structural difierences are not improbably due to
peculiarities of mode of life. The genera which have the ramus of the
mandible produced beyond the glenoid cavity have strong conical teeth, very

unequal in size, the largest being set at definite intervals. Loxomma, on the

contrary, has flattened teeth with two cutting-edges ; and the inequality of

size which they present is apparently due to irregular replacement. The first

group may have had the habits of many Crocodiles, feeding chiefly on dead

bodies or terrestrial animals, and consequently requiring strength in masti-

cation rather than special rapidity in opening and closing the jaws. Loxomma,
on the contrary, may have been a sort of Gavial among the Labyrinthodonts,

a fish-eater, whose supply of food depended upon dexterity in snapping up
smaU, quick-moving objects, gaining therefore by a structure of jaw which

gives velocity at the expense of force.

  --The dentary bone supports a row of teeth and in Lahyr'mthodon a short

inner series also, consisting of one, two, or three large tusks which are confined

to the symphysial end. This is also apparently the case with Trematosaurus,

and may be trueof other examples, in which the mandible is distorted by

lateral compression so as to show tusks apparently in series with smaller

teeth. Dendrerpeton acadianum is represented as having in the lower jaw
" a uniform series of conical teeth, not perceptibly enlarged toward the front,
and an inner series of larger and phcatcd teeth, as in the upper jaw " *.

  A large oval aperture has been observed upon the inner side of the lower

jaw, a little posterior to the middle of the ramus. It is bounded by the
articular bone above, and by the angular bone below. 8ach an internal
mandibular foramen exists in Mastodonsaurus, Trematosaurus, PacJuigonia,
Goniocjlyptus, and in undescribed specimens from the Kouper of Warwick!

No trace of an external mandibular foramen has been discovered. In Croco-

dilia both are present.

The mandibular symphysis was incomplete, and the rami were united by

ligament or fibro-cartilage, if we may judge from their constant separation in

a fossil state. In Pteroplax the opposed symphysial ends are expanded by an

Ainwardly directed process from the inferior border of each ramus f.

       mucous canal has been observed to run along the lower margin of the

Aouter surface of the rami in Pteroplax, Loxomma, and others.  descending

canal is strongly marked upon the external surface of the articular and angular

bones of some Triassic specimens. The sculpture, commonly present upon the

angular bone, may oover the entire subcutaneous surface, as in Loxomma.

The outer surface of the posterior end of the mandible is overlapped by the

quadrate -jugal, and in some cases by the maxilla also. In Ehinosanrus the

quadrate -jugal descends for a considerable distance over the mandible, as far

as the upper border of the angular bone.

--Sclerotic Orbital Ring. In Arcliegoscmrus Decheni* and A. latirostrisf, a

series of ossicles, which undoubtedly constituted a bony sclerotic ring, has

been found. As many as twenty-three ossicles have been observed in one

specimen but, owing to their scattered position and the perishable natui'e of
                                               ;

the contiguous parts, no example shows the series in its true position. The

annular arrangement is distinctly visible in one specimen. The individual

--ossicles are of nearly quadrilateral form J.
   Teeth. Tt appears from the observations of Von Meyer that the tooth of a

Labyrinthodont (ArcJiegosaurus) consists at first of a minute hollow cone of

enamel armed with two vertical diametrically opposite ridges. This, the true

crown of the tooth, retains its original structure and size until it disappears

by abrasion or fracture §. It does not, however, remain in its original
position, sessile upon the alveolar surface, but is gradually elevated upon a

conical base. This base, which is often the only part of the tooth preserved,

has the general form of a hollow cone of dentine, coated thinly with enamel,

and enclosing a pulp-cavity. The dentinal wall in a well-characterized

Labyrinthodont becomes folded longitudinally ; and some or nearly aU of the

folds may be again plaited. In a much convoluted tooth the folds are very

compact, and leave only linear spaces between them. In this way the thick-

ness of the dentinal wall is greatly increased, and the central cavity much

encroached upon.

In Lahynnthodon, Prof. Owen describes a layer of cement as penetrating

such of the interspaces between the dentinal folds as communicate with the

exterior ||. This structure is certainly wanting in the Carboniferous Laby-

rinthodonts, where neither enamel nor cement is present between the folds of

Adentine.  cross section of such a tooth as has been described exhibits a set

of sinuous and, it may be, branched interspaces communicating with the ex-

terior, and corresponding series (separated from the other by the dentinal

and it would appear from the descriptions that in some of the " Microsauria "

of Dr. Dawson the dentine is not folded at all. Externally the tooth is

grooved, and sometimes ridged also. It is frequently compressed in the

direction of the axis of the jaw, so as to present an oval or elliptical section.

Vertical edges (anterior and posterior) extending downwards upon the basal

portion are found in Loxomma. In Pterojjlax they are confined to the apex,

but are larger than usual. As a rule they are minute and not persistent.

The teeth were attached to shallow depressions, which take the form of the

base and are often marked by radiating ridges corresponding with the den-

tinal folds. The mandibular alveolus is generally bordered by an external

ridge, which may be as much as a quarter of an inch high.

   There is always a premaxillary series, and, except where the maxilla is

wanting, a maxillary series also. The maxillary teeth may form an unin-
terrupted row ; or large tusks and depressious may occur at intervals. The

vomer and palatal are always dentigerous, giving attachment to an inner

longitudinal series, parallel with the outer or maxillary series. In Batra-

chiderpeton the vomerine plates are armed with clustered teeth, resembling

the aggregated teeth of Siren and Siredon. The mandible bears a rcw of
teeth, which may be continuous, or interrupted by large tusks and depressions.

A pair of tusks is frequently found near the anterior end of the rami. In

Labyrinthodon, Trematosaurus, and some other genera a short inner series

of large teeth is found near the symphysial end of the mandible. Among

recent Amphibia a double row of mandibular teeth occurs in Epicrium and
Siredon : it is present in many fishes.

   Most commonly a number of teeth are represented only by gaps, or scars
upon the alveolar border ; the vacant places frequently alternate with the

standing teeth, rendering it probable that about half the teeth were normally
efficient at the same time, and that they were replaced alternately. The

substitution of the palatal teeth was less regular : new teeth appear to have

been usually developed upon vacant spaces ; but in some instances the

successional tooth appears in front, behind, or to the inner side of its

--l^redecessor.
   Vertebral Column. The following general features of the vertebral column

of Labyrinthodonts may be noted :

   a. The number of vertebras is large.

 --b. There are at least two kinds of vertebrae thoracic and caudal.

   c. The centra are biconcave.

  Ad. superior arch and spine are present in all the vertebrae which are ac-

curately known.

    e. Inferior arches are present in the caudal region.

  /. Where zygapophjses are present, the anterior look more or less inwards
and generally upwards also.

   g. The spinal foramen is much contracted.
   The chief variations which occur in the corresponding vertebrae of different

species are these :

The centra vary greatly with respect to their degree of ossification. In

Archegosauriis, for example, the notochord is persistent, and the only osseous

parts of the vertebrae are the superior arches, superior spinous processes,

trausverse processes (proceeding from the laminae of the superior arches),

inferior arches, inferior spinous processes, and lateral wedge-bones ("seitliche

=KeUe" of Von Meyer "interneural and interhaemal pieces"?). It has

been suggested by Professor Huxley * that the inferior arches and lateral
wedge-bones may represent osseous rings, like those which remain of the
centra of Megalichihys, and that " they have broken up into the separate

pieces described by Von Meyer in the process of fossilization." In Mastodon-

sauria, on the contrary, and most of the undoubted Carboniferous Labyrin-

thodonts, the centra are well ossified. In Loxomma and Anihracosaurus a

Asmall notochordal foramen is apparently persistent.  neuro-central suture

appears to have been permanently present in some, if not in all.

The centra of the Carboniferous species are usually discoidal, the antero-

posterior length being small ; but the vertebrae of Ophiderpeton and Lepter-

peton, as well as those of Labyrinthodon f and some of the Microsauria of
Dawson have hourglass- shaped centra of considerable longitudinal extent.

    There are usually two articular facets for the ribs, both situate on the
neural transverse process. In Masfodonsaurtcs, however, the lower facet is
continuous with the centrum J ; and an example of the vertebral column of

a Labyrinthoclont from the Northumberland coal -field, which Mr. T. P. Barkas
has permitted us to study, seems to exhibit the same feature *.

   The superior aud inferior spinous processes differ greatly as to length

and form. In Archegosaurus aud many others the spinous processes, both

superior and inferior, are broad and quadrilateral. In Urocordi/lus and
CEstocephalusf the superior and inferior spinous processes of the long tail are
elongate and fan-shaped, being dilated, compressed, and truncated at the
distal ends, so as to suggest great swimming-power.

   The inferior arches are rarely seen to advantage ; but in Archegosaui-us they
are large and complete, forming a spacious canal for the caudal vessels J.

   By study of young specimens oi Archegosaurus it has been ascertained that

the superior vertebral arches ossify before the inferior, and the anterior ver-
tebrae before the posterior. Von Meyer thinks it probable that the superior
arches were ossified to a considerable extent before the close of embryonic

life §.

   The atlas of Mastodonsaurus has been figured and described ||. It is a

flattish disk, presenting two oval cavities to the occipital condyles, and nearly

smooth behind. Above, the lamiuae enclose the chief part of the spinal

foramen, ascending to form a spinous process of considerable but unknown

Aheight.  cavity for the odontoid occupies nearly the centre of the bone,

between the articular facets, and communicates with the spinal foramen by a

--constricted passage.
   Jlibs. No Labyrinthodont is known to have been devoid of well-developed

ribs. They are generally attached to all the vertebrae in advance of the
pelvis, and in some cases, at least, are present in the anterior part of the

caudal region also.

As to form, they are usually compressed (transversely to the axis of the

trunk) at either end, but are nearly cylindrical in the centre of the shaft.

They are short, relatively to the probable dimensions of the thorax, and

Astrongly curved.    capitnlum and tuberculum are present in aU well-

preserved examples. Both articular surfaces are slightly concave and

adjacent, and in most of the Labyrinthodonts both appear to have articulated

with the vertebral transverse process ; a notch or groove commonly separates

them, and is usually continued for some distance along the shaft of the rib.

Sternal or abdominal ribs are not known to occur in this order.
It appears from the extensive suite of specimens described by Von Meyer ^,

that the ribs of Archegosaurus were developed and partially ossified at a veiy

early period, perhaps before the close of embryonic life. Some very young

* This fossil is named Macrosaurus ^^olyspondylus by Mr. Barkas ; but its generic

' oat-shaped scales ' of the lower surfaces." But Urocorch/lus has slender ribs, of more

than usual length. Were the absence of oat-shaped scutes from the ventral surface of the

American examples of (Estoccphalus established, little could be proved thereby. In the

Northumberland coal-field Labyrinthodonts abound, yet the scutes appear not to have

--been hitherto discovered. On the following page of his ' Synopsis,' however, Prof. Cope

says of (Estocephalus: "The skin has been occupied by a great number of closely packed,
curved, spine-shaped scales. They have occupied the ventral integument, passing from
the median line of the belly outwards and posteriorly, having acute tips, which may or

may not have penetrated the skin on each side." This structure cannot differ essentially

from the clieyron pattern of oat-shaj^cd scutes found in Urocordylus.

 examples afford evidence of cartilaginous vertebral extremities, this evidence
 consisting of the separation of the proximal ends of the ribs from the vertebral
 column by a regular interval, and the hollowing-out of the ends as if for

junction with cartilage *. At this stage a transverse process may be seen to

project for a short distance from the lamina of the corresponding sujDcrior
arch. The junction is not completed by a true bony articulation until the

--animal is nearly adult.
    Shoidder-rjinlle. The shoulder-girdle of the Labyrinthodonts includes

three thoracic plates (which represent the clavicles andinterclavicles), one or
more scapular bones, and a coracoid. In form and arrangement these parts

differ much from the pectoral arch of any recent Amphibian, but correspond
generally with the structure which prevails in some Eeptilia, such as the

Lacertilia (e. g. Trachydosaurus, Monitor, Iguana) and the Ichthyosauria.
The resemblance between the shoulder-girdle of the Labyrinthodonts and
that of the Ichthj'osauria is close and striking.

    The thoracic plates are eminently characteristic of the true Labyrintho-
donts. They are three in number, a median and two lateral. The median
plate is elongated, and more or less rhomboidal ; it is placed lojigitudinally.

On each side it is overlapped by the lateral plates to a considerable degree,

especially upon the antero-external borders ; and frequently only the hinder
end is exposed. The free part ordinarily exhibits sculpturing. The lateral
plates have been compared as to form to the elytra of beetles. They are

--often, but not always, triangular in form the base, which is directed inwards,

being rounded, and the remaining sides set at an angle of 90 degrees or more.

A sculptured pattern is sometimes seen to radiate from the angle ; and this is

the thickest and strongest portion of the plate.

   The thoracic plates extend nearly from side to side, and may protect a

third, or even more, of the ventral surface of the trunk. They vary greatly
as to form and relative size.

   The median plate represents the interclavicle, and the lateral plates the
clavicles. All are dermal bones, forming no part of the true axial and ap-

pendicular endo-skeleton.

   Behind these (that is, nearer to the pelvic arch) and in a deeper plane are
the remains of the scapula and coracoid. These are most completely pre-

served in Archegosaurus, and much resemble the corresponding parts in the

recent Sir-en.

   The coracoid is ventrally situate, semilunar in form, having a concave
thickened posterior margin, a thickened postero-external angle, and a regu-
larly rounded anterior edge. There is no reason to suppose that this does
not retain, approximately, its natural position. On the outer side of the
coracoid there lies in an oblique position a long, narrow, flattisl) slip of bone
its posterior end, which is expanded and a little twisted, is adjacent to the
postero-external angle of the coracoid ; while the other or anterior end is
produced at great length forwards and inwards, generally passing beneath the
thoracic shield. Another bone, which may, however, be a detached part of
the same, is seen in several examples of Archetjosaurus. It lies somewhat in-

ternal to the last described bone, immediately behind the edge of the thoracic

plates, and has a slightly expanded end f. There can be little doubt that wo

have here a scapula, and probably a suprascapular bone also. The glenoid
cavity was probably cartilaginous in Avcliec/osaurus, and is not shown in the

fossil specimens. It seems to have been at tlie postero-external angle of the

coracoid.

   Von Meyer and Burmeister have described the bone here named coracoid

as the scapula, and the scapula (or suprascapula) as the coracoid.

The coracoid of Trcmatoscmrxis is known ; it closely resembles that of

AArclmjosaurus.  detached scapula of Pliolidcrpeton has also occurred. No

scapula or coracoid has been found in the other genera. The thoracic plates

of Mastodonscmrus, Tremafosaums, Archerjosaurus, Loxomma, Pholidogaster,

Pteroplax (^.') , Keraterpeton, and Urocordylits (?) are known; but none have
hitherto been discovered in any of the species which constitute the " Micro-

--sauria " of Dr. Dawson.
   Pelvic Girdle. Arcliegosatirus still remains the only source of exact

knowledge respecting the pelvis of the Labyrinthodouts. The ischia are

elongate, flattened bones, which meet along the middle line. Their antcro-
extemal angles are overlapped by the expanded ends of the hatched-shaped

ilia, while the straight shafts of these latter bones are coutiniied backwards,
outwards, and upwards. Similar, but larger, hatchet-shaped ilia occur in the

Newcastle coal-field. They may belong to Loxomma or Antliracosaurus.

The connexion of the ilium with the vertebral column appears to have been

very slight ; and there is no indication of specially modified sacral vertebras.

The pubis is straight, and has much of the form of the femur or humerus,
being narrowed at the middle and broad at each end. The situation and

composition of the acetabulum is unknown.
   It would be highly interesting to know that the ilium described and

figured by Professor Owen* was actually the ilium of Lahririniliodon pa-

cliygnathus, or of any other Labyrinthodont ; but the evidence derived from
the place of discovery is not cogent, and the bone is remarkably reptilian in

character.

 --Bones of tlie Limhs. In the Carboniferous Labyrinthodouts the bony

elements of the limbs of vertebrates higher than fishes appear in their most
generalized form. The manus and pes are pentadactyle, and there is but
little difierentiation of the digits. Each of the long bones has expanded ends,

and is contracted towards the middle of the shaft. In the Carboniferous

species the articulations seem to have been very lax. There are no articular

processes, condyles, cups or trochlese ; and the bones appear to have been
connected in the simplest way, by ligaments and integument. The long
bones of Hylonomus and some other " Microsauria " are tubular, and consist

of a uniform osseous crust, enclosing a central cavity, which in the living
animal was probably occupied by cartilage f. In several other Labyrinlho-

donts, however, of Carboniferous age, true cancellous tissue is present in the
long bones.

If the limb-bones attribiited to Mastodonsaurus have been so determined

correctly, it woiild appear that in the Triassic Labj'rinthodonts the long
bones and phalanges were, as in the Carboniferous species, dilated at the
ends and contracted in the centre. There is no indication of bony epi-
physes ; and the muscular impressions are few and simple J.

   In all the species whose limbs are accurately known from their occur-
rence together in the same matrix and in something like the natural position,

the corresponding parts of the fore and hind limbs (c. g. the femur and hu-

merus) are very similar in form and present no uncommon difference of size*.
The hinder limb is larger and stronger than the other, as is usual with qua-
druped vertebrates. On the whole the structure and proportions of the ex-

tremities of Labyrinthodonts are similar to those of urodele Amphibia, and

indicate low-bodied aquatic animals.

   It is wcU known that the examination of the bones found in the Keuper

of Leamington and Warwick, together with a comparison of the footprints

named Oheirotherium, led Professor Owen to the behef that Lahi/rintJioclo)i

exhibited a striking disproportion between the fore and hind limbs. This
view accords well with the opinion that the Labyrinthodonts were anurous
Batrachia. But such a disproportion implies more than a near affinity with
the Batrachia : it is in this class (Amphibia) a mechanical provision for
activity in leaping ; and the inference from Professor Owen's hypothesis
would be that the Triassic Labyrintliodonts at least had in some measure the
habits of the frog. The supposition will not stand a moment's consideration.
That a Lahyr'intlwdon, with its greatly expanded and prolonged head could

have leaped a yard without a severe shock is improbable. But if we suppose

that it possessed the thoracic jilatcs and the loosely articulated shoidder-

girdle of other Triassic Labyrinthodonts, and if, with Professor Owen, we

interpret the structure of its extremities according to the Cheirotherian foot-

prints, the difficulty is greatly increased. The Labyrintlwdon would be a
leaping animal of gigantic size, weighted with i^rotective scutes, having little-
expanded toes, and not provided, to our knowledge, with a single one of
tliose special provisions which enable large animals to leap great distances
with safety.

   Wo one will explain the assumed disproportion of fore and hind limbs as

indicative of peculiar browsing or climbing propensities, such as those attri-
buted to Iguanodon or Hadrosaurits. The aquatic and predatory character

of the Labyrinthodonts is well established.

    Since the hypothesis under discussion involves such difficulties, it wiU be
desirable to reexamine the ground upon which it rests.

    Professor Owen's position is this : Anisojms scutidatns, a presumed
Labyrinthodont, has a hind limb at least twice as large as the fore limb.

   An ilium and head of femur, presumed to belong to Lahyrinthodon

2''ac7iygnai7n(s, are greatly larger in proportion than a humerus referred to
the same species.

    In some Cheirotherian (presumed Labyrinthodont) footprints the tracks of
one foot are much larger than those of the other.

   The species of Labyrintlwdon differ considerably in size, as also do the

footprints of Cheirotheiium.
    It is hardly necessary to diseuss.the distinctness of the species of Labyrin-

tliodon or of Cheirotheriiim. The whole weight of the argument rests upon
the suppositions that (!) the bones named Anisopus scutidatus, (2) the ilium
and femur found at Warwick, (3) the humerus found separately at the same
place, (4) the footprints named Cheirothcrium, belong to Labyrinthodonts
and, further, that the ilium and humerus found at different times in the same
quarry belong to the same individual, or to individuals of the same si^ecies
and age.

    Iliis chain of suppositions has not been strengthened by the further cvi-

   * There is no conclusive evidence that Anisopus is labyrinthodont. The rhomboidal
sculptured scute attached to the slab containing this specimen might seem confirmatory of
Prof. Owen's determination ; but, besides the Crocodilia, the Scelidosuuridx had dcru.al
armour.

Wedence brought to light since the date of Professor Owen's memoir.  still

know very little about the limbs of Triassic Labyrinthodonts. What is known

of the limbs of the Carboniferous species does not at all agree with the deter-

minations in question. But it is now placed beyond dispute that in Triassic

rocks, and in this very Keuper quarry at Warwick, the remains of Dinosauria
occur. The ilium assigned to Lahyriniliodon pacliygnathus * agrees with the

ilium of Dei7iosauria in the remarkable projection of the bone in front of the

acetabulum, and in the character of the acetabulum itself. It wants, it is

true, the pre- and postacetabular processes of a TveU-characterized Dino-

saurian ilium ; but in*no particular does this bone agree with the ilium of

any known Labyrinthodont. There is nothing in the structure of any one of

the limb-bones or vertebrae attributed to L. pachygnatlius which does not

accord at least as well with the Dinosauria as with the Labyrinthodonts f.

Nor is there a single distinctive Labyrinthodont feature about Cheirotherium.
Some of the footprints included in this heterogeneous group may have been

Labyrinthodont ; but others are, not improbably, Dinosaurian J. Shortness
or deficiency of the outer digits §, and inequality of fore and hind limb, are

characteristic of this reptilian order |!,

   It may be said, summarily, that the Labyrinthodonts of the Coal-measures

had the limbs of aquatic animals similar to the urodele Amphibia, and that

the limbs of the Triassic species are practically unknown.

No limbs have been discovered belonging to specimens of Ophklerpeton,

although several examples belonging to this genus have occurred in the coal-

--fields of Kilkenny and Northumberland.

  Hyoid. We have no certain knowledge of the hyoid of any Labyrinthodont.
A fragment of a styloid bone which sometimes appears between the para-

sphenoid and the median thoracic plate of Archegosaurus, associated with one

or two pairs of lateral appendages, may belong here.

 -- ^Branchial Arches. Goldfuss first observed that some young examples of

Archegosaurus exhibit distinct traces of branchial arches ; and this determi-

nation is confirmed by Von Meyer. The evidence consists of minute ossicles

lying scattered in the region of the throat, between the thoracic plates and

the skull. Some of the ossicles exhibit a pectinate edge. They are variously

discoidal, semilunar, or quadrangular in outline, but always flattened. Von

Meyer believes that the branchial arches were attached to the hyoid, and

were disposed in two or more curved rows. Traces of branchial arches have

only been detected in young specimens ; and they do not increase in size with

   * ' The remarkable ilium ascribed to Lahyritithodcm pachi/gnatJms is also a reptilian

--bone, intermediate in its characters between the ilium of a Teleosaurian and that of a

Lizard." Huxley, ' Geol. Journ.' vol. xxri. p. 47 (1870).

   t The fragmentary vertebra ascribed by Prof. Owen to L. pacht/gnathus is believed by
Prof. Huxley to be Dinosaurian (Quart. Joiirn. Q-col. Soc. 1870, vol. xxvi. p. 47).

   \ The Clieirothorian footprint figured and described by Prof. W. C. Williamson (Quart.
Journ. Geol. Soc. vol. xxiii. p. 56) exhibits numerous impressions of scales. This is a

re]5tilian feature, though not conclusive against the Labyrinthodont supposition.

recently Leidy, have concluded that tlie Dinosauria (at least Iguanodon and Hadrosaiirus)

may have sujiported themselves for a longer or shorter period upon their hind legs. But
the discovery made in the Weald by Mr. Beckles, of traces of large three-toed footprints, of

such a size and at such a distance apart that it is difficult to believe that they can have
been made by any thing but an Iguanodon, lead to the supposition that this vast reptile,
and porha)3s others of its family, must have walked temporarily or permanently upon its
hind legs."-- Huxley, 'Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc' vol. xxvi. p. 18 (1870).

  age. It is therefore highly probable that the branchial respiration of Arche-

 ffosaurits was not persistent, biit was restricted to the larval state.
     It is somewhat remarkable that while Yon Mej-er interprets these remains

 as traces of a branchial apparatus, he nevertheless refuses to recognize the
 zoological significance of such a structure. His comment is, that tlie hyoid

 itself is a relic of branchial apparatus, yet its presence in the higher verte-

 brates is not allowed to interfere with their systematic arrangement *. The
 serial homology of the hyoid and branchial arches, upon which Yon Meyer
 perhaps relies, would prove too much for his purpose. The study of deve-
 lopment shows that " the branchial arches have the same morphological value

 as the hyoid, and the latter as the mandibular arc;"t further, that the tra-
 beculae cranii (" Schadelbalken " of Rathke) are serially homologous with the
 visceral arches. If the argument rests, not upon homology, but upon function,

it is clear that the common association of branchiostegal rays with the hyoid
 arch in branchiate vertebrates would not justify us in describing a part whose

 function in the higher classes is so various as a remnant of branchial appa-
 ratus. It would be as reasonable to speak of the humerus as a relic of a

 swimming-organ.
    Until an example is cited of osseous branchial arches in an abranchiate

vertebrate, we may regard the presence of such a structure in the young

--Arcliegosaurus as a remarkable Amphibian character.
    Dermal Armour. In nearly all the known species of Carboniferous Laby-
rinthodonts a ventral armour has been found. The armour consists of very

numerous, elongated, osseous scutes, and is generally, perhaps always, confined
to the inferior surface of the body between the fore and hind limbs. The
 scutes are usually dis])osed in oblique rows, which meet at an angle along

 the middle line and make a chevron pattern. Such an arrangement occiurs
for example in P7io//f?o^ffs/e?' J, Urocordi/lus§, and Ichthyerpeton\\. In ^?--

 chegosaurus the pattern is reversed in the hinder part of the trunk, so that

 the rows of scutes in the front part are approximately at right angles to those

placed further back on the same side.
    Lepidotosaurus, if a true Labyrinthodont, presents striking deviations from

the rest in the character of its dermal armour. But there arc many diiBcul-
ties in the way of obtaining an adequate knowledge of this remarkable form.
The state of the single specimen hitherto discovered does not permit more

%than a superficial examination. Messrs. Hancock and Howse have done all

that care and skill can do towards elucidating its structure ; and we cannot
but accept, provisionally, their decision that it must be j^laced among the

 Labyrinthodonts. Nevertheless the difficulties are considerable, especially

with respect to the scales or scutes. The oblique and uniform direction of the
very numerous and prolonged rows of scales is an argument against Prof.
.Huxley's view that they represent a ventral armour shifted (after death and
some amount of decay) to one side. Upon that supposition we should expect
 to find the rows of scales either transverse (an arrangement not yet discovered
in any Labyrinthodont) or converging from opposite sides to a straight line

(as in Arcliegosaunis, Vrocordyhis, &c.). Moreover the scales are quite
imlilfe those of any well-established Labyrinthodont genus, and both in dis-
position and extent they are anomalous. The ribs and the (presumed) long
neck are also difficult to reconcile with the Labyrinthodont character of this

interesting fossil.

   As to form and size the scutes of the Labyrinthodonts vary much. They

may be oval, rhomboidal, lancet-shaped, or oat-shaped. They may be as much

as two inches long, or so minute as to be barely visible. "When thick and

large, they exhibit a cancellous bony structure in cross section ; in many cases
they are coated with an enamel-like layer ; and when the scute is very thin,

this layer seems to compose its entire substance.

   Such an armour cannot be exactly paralleled by any thing known among
recent Amphibia or Eeptilia. The CrocodiLia have bony scutes, which in
Caiman and Jacare lie along the belly ; but neither these, nor the bony scales

of certain lizards {Ophisaiirus, Pseudopus, Cj/clodiis), are restricted to the

ventral surface. The dermal ossifications of Chelonia are dorsal as well as
ventral. In a few recent Batrachia {Ceratophrys cornuta, G. ornaia, Brachy-
ceplialus epMppium*) there is a partial dorsal shield. In the cutis of some
Gymnophiona there are minute flexible scales f.

    Granular, shagreen -like scales have been found to cover other parts of the

body of a few Labyrinthodonts. Dr. Dawson has figured and described a
remarkable covering of homy scales as forming dorsal and lateral appendages
to Hylonomus Lyelli'^; but there does not appear to be conclusive evidence as

--to their disposition.
    Nature of Food and Mode of Life. The character of the teeth and the

 striicture of the skull, so similar as a prehensile and masticatory organ to the
 skulls of Crocodilia, indicate plainly that the Labyrinthodonts were predacious

 animals. Patches of Acanthodian scales foxmd on the inner side of the ven-
 tral armour have led Burmeister to suppose that Archegosaurus at least was

 a fish-eater§. Von Meyer quotes instances of the occurrence of fragments

 of Archcgosaurian plates in coprolites assigned to the same species. Dr.
 Dawson has found near the bones of Hylonoiims portions of coprohte contain-
 ing remains of insects and myriapods ; while numerous bones of the same

     The Amphibian affinities of Labyrinthodonts and the presence of a branchial

 apparatus in the larva render it plain that these animals were wholly aquatic
 in their earliest stages. The proportions of the skuU, and the weak limbs of

 all the known Carboniferous species, at least, furnish reasons for beheving
 that throughout life they frequented water, and sought their food in it. The
 analogy of all other Amphibia would lead us to suppose that the Labyrintho-
 donts were fluviatile, not marine. The character of the deposits in which

 their remains are usually found confirms this view.
     There is ground for believing that the largest Labyrinthodonts attaiaed a

 length of seven or eight feet, though accurate data are wanting. Some of
 the smaller examples, though adult and perfect, do not exceed as many inches

--in length.

ON THE STRUCTUUE OF THE LABYRINTIIODONTS.  247

would not be easy to frame an unexceptionable statement as to the zoological

position of the Labyrinthodonts. "Were they now alive, they wovild doubtless
be considered Amphibia. The double occipital condyle, the parasphenoid

ossification, and the presence of a branchial apparatus in the young or larval
state would overpower such considerations as the Crocodilian scutes or the
Crocodilian character of the exposed parts of the cranium. Eut in dealing

with a long extinct group we are not altogether justified in trusting simply

to those characters which suffice to define the classes and orders of existing

animals. On any theory of descent with modification there would thus be
danger of coordinating an extinct group with its own modified or difl^erentiated
descendants. Even if all such theories be discarded, it remains to be shown
that we can legitimately impose a division into Classes and Orders based on

the study of recent Yertebrates upon generic forms of Carboniferous or

Triassic age.

   Palteontologists have not not held themselves bound to refer every ancient
type to existing classes. The Labyrinthodonts were regarded by Goldfuss as
intermediate between Crocodilia and Lacertilia, afterwards as intermediate
between Ichthyoda (Perennibranchiata), Crocodilia, and Lacertilia. Burmeister

+considers them to have affinity to all the orders of Amphibia (Amphibia Eep-

tilia), taking the same view of the position of the Trilobita among Crustacea.

Now that the writings of Darwin have given greater definiteness and coherence

to such views of zoological relation, and have rendered it possible to regard
all natural history as a pedigree, speculation has become bold indeed.
Hteckel* is able to assure us that the Ganocephala diverged from the Peren-
nibranchiate Amphibia (which make the thirteenth step in the descent of
man) during the Carboniferous period, that they developed Proterosaurus and
the Labyrinthodonts (branches which soon died out), and that the Ganocepha-

lous line is continued down to our own day by the Gymnophiona. It is
hardly necessary to point to Hssckel's " Stammbaum " of the Ganoid Pishes and
the Dipnoi, which recent discoveries have done so much to impugn, in order

to inspire distrust of these " far-reaching Phylogenies." Speculation as to
the derivation of ordinal tj-pes, though undoubtedly legitimate, has hitherto

proved extremely hazardous.

   If we restrict ourselves to such statements as may be maintained by evi-

--dence, we can at present say nothing more definite than this : that the

Labyrinthodonts were in nearly all important respects like recent Amphibia
that their most striking peculiarities are those which adapted them for a

predatory life ; that certain species, or certain details of structure, recall
the recent Ilrodela, others the Gymnophiona, while the resemblance to the

Batrachia is hardly ever so close as to one or other of the lower orders of

--existing Amphibia.
    Distribution. Remains of Labyi'inthodonts have occurred in England,
Scotland, Ireland, Germany, Russia, Central India, South Africa, Australia,

and North America. In the British Museum and in the Museum of the

 College of Surgeons undescribed specimens of Labyrinthodonts are pre-

 served, which have -been obtained from the Rhffitic beds of the Severn.
One genus (BJiinosaun(s) has occurred in the Oolitic strata of the Govern-
ment of Simbirsk (Russia). It is there associated with Ichthyosauria and

 Qrypliaa dilatata.

--Note. Since the preceding Eeport was presented, additional information

has been obtained from various sources, particiilarly by means of a detailed

examination of the Labyrinthodont fossils in the Museum at Warwick. The

nature of the mandibular articulation of Mastodonsaurus, for example, is

more clearly revealed by undescribed specimens in the Warwick collection

Athan by any of the Wiirtcmberg fossils.        special paper, containing an

account of the results arrived at, wiU shortly be published. Some notice of

the structure of the osseous ear-chamber, as exliibited by the large skull of

Capitosaurus from the Keuper sandstone of Wiirtemberg, should have been

included in the Report. The essential facts are given by Quenstcdt (Die

Mastodonsaurier im griinen Kcupersandsteine Wiirtembcrg's sind Batrachier,

p. 14, t. ii. fig. 1, and t. iii. figs. 16, 18). On a future occasion the Com-

mittee hope to give the results of a microscopic examination, now in progress,

of the teeth of various Labyrinthodont genera.

Report of the Committee appointed to construct and print Catalogues
    of Spectral Rays arranged upon a scale of Wave-7iumbers, the
    Committee consisting of Dr. Huggins, J. N. Lockyer, Professor
    Reynolds, Professor Swan, and G. Johnstone Stone y (Reporter).

The Committee, appointed to construct and print catalogues of sj^ectral lines
arranged upon a scale of wave-numbers, had hoped to i)resent the catalogue
of solar lines, and of a large number of metallic lines, at the present Meeting

of the Association ; but a delay having arisen about the engraving of the
maps which should accompany the catalogues, they have not been able to go

to press in sufficient time.

   The whole of the solar spectrum is now ready for the printer ; and the

reduction of those positions of metallic lines which Thale'n determined by the
250 REPORT--1873.

method of direct superposition upon the solar spectrum is in a forward state.
The solar lines have been thrown into the groups which catch the eye in ob-
serving the spectrum ; and the position of each line has been corrected for the

dispersion of the air. Both Kirchhoffs arbitrary number and Angstrom's

determination of wave-length will be given along with the wave-number for

each line                                                  so that  it is  hoped that, when these  catalogues  are  printed, ob-
                                                        ;

servers will find in them, in a collected form, the best materials which yet

exist for the identification of lines, and for reducing fresh determinations,

either to wave-lengths in air or wave-numbers in vacuo.

The Committee had taken Angstrom's determinations of the wave-lengths

of about a thousand solar lines, published in his ' Recherclies sur lo Spectre

Solaii'e,' as the foundation of their catalogues. They are therefore glad to

"be able to state, on the authority of the Astronomer lioyal, that his criticism

relied on by the Committee.                                                ^

The small final coiTcctions mentioned by Angstrom at p. 29 of his memoir

have been applied throughout to the numbers of his catalogue. The correc-

tion for each line was ascertained by a diagram constructed by plottinag
down the corrections corresponding to the lines of the select list which he

gives on pp. 31 & 32. The Association Catalogue may therefore be regarded

                                   o

as representing Angstrom's work in its finished state.

The corrections to be applied for the dispersion of the air have been

deduced from Ketteler's determinations of the refractive inthces of air cor-

responding to the positions of the lithium, sodium, and thallium lines. These

give only three points on the curve ; but as they lie nearly in a straight line

when referred to a scale of wave-niimbers, the extension to the limits of the

visible spectrum is tolerably safe. jSTevertheless it would be very desirable

that a determination of this important correction should be made, extending

over the whole spectrum. One of the members of the Committee hoped to

execute this work, and planned the apparatus which seemed necessary ; but
he could not command sufficient time to carry out his intention.

Since your Committee have not finished the task intrusted to them, they

recommend that they be reappointed ; they would request that Messrs. Spot-
tiswoode and Do La Eue be invited to serve along with them.

Rejjort of the Committee, consisting of ^'ix John Lubbock, Bart., Pro-

    tary, appointed for the purpose of exploring the Settle Caves.

   Drawn up by Mr. Boyd Dawkins.

The Committee appointed by the British A.ssociation at the last Meeting,

at Brighton, to cooperate with the Settle-Cave Committee in carrying on the
exploration of the Victoria Cave, has expended the grant intrusted to them,
with but negative results. Since the last Eeport was pubhshed, in which
the discovery of the Pleistocene cave- earth underneath the grey clay at the
entrance was recorded, their attention was directed to the examination of the
ON THE EXPLORATION OF THE SETTLE CAVES.                                 251

APleistocene stratum and its relation to the deposits above and below.  pas-

sage was cut th-rough the talua of angular detritus fallen from the cliff at the

same level as the cave-earth, which proved that the detritus graduated in its
lower part into a clay containing stones, among Avhich glaciated Silurian

grit-stones were recognized on 3rd November, 1872. These were close to a

large mass of fallen rock which formed the left-hand side of the passage that

had been cut at the entrance, the right-hand consisting of the solid lime-

stone wall of the cave. They rested at about the same level as the stratum

coutaining the cave-mammals, and apparently were deposited on the edges
of that stratum. Some of them were embedded in clay, while others, which

were to be seen in the section exposed May 21 last, were free, the clay that

once covered them being washed away.

At the end of the passage, and just within the entrance of the cave, a shaft

was sunk, which proved that the cave-earth was only from 3 to 4 feet thick,

and that it rested on a confused stratum of large limestone blocks embedded

in clay both amorphous and laminated, and in some cases in sand, 7 feet
thick. Below this the workmen broke into a passage, of which one side was

composed of the wall of the cave.

This section revealed the fact that the laminated clay occurred at various

levels, not merely above but below the Pleistocene stratum ; and there seems

to the Secretary (Mr. Dawkins) to be no reason why it should not be depo-
sited now in some of the interstices between the blocks of stone hclow the

I'leistocene stratum by the heavy rains.

   The evidence as to the precise relation of the older deposits in the cave to
the glacial phenomenon of the district is not so clear as might have been ex-

pected. The boulders may be the deposit in situ of a lateral moraine ; or they
may have dropped subsequently from a higher level. It is, however, obvious

that the hyaenas, bears, mammoths, and other creatures found in the Pleisto-

cene stratum could not have occupied the district where it was covered by

ice. And had they lived hero after the retreat of the ice-sheet, their remains

would occur in the river-gravels from which they are absent throughout a
large area to the north of a line drawn between Chester and York, since they

occur abundantly in the postglacial river-deposits south of that line. On the

other hand, they belong to a fauna that overran Europe, and must have

occupied this very region, before the Glacial period. It may therefore reason-

ably be concluded that they occupied the cave in preglacial times, and that
the stratum in which their remains lie buried was protected from the grind-
ing of the ice-sheet* which destroyed nearly all the sitrface-aecumulations in
the river-valleys, by the walls and roof of rock which has since been to a
groat extent weathered away.

The exploration of the Victoria Cave, which has hitherto yielded such in-

teresting evidence of three distinct occupations (first bj' the hyajnas, then

by Neolithic men, and lastly by the Britwelsh), is by no means complete. The
cave itself is of unknown depth and extent ; and the mere removal of so
much earth and clay as it is at present known to contain will be a labour of
j'^ears. The results of the exploration up to the present time are of almost

equal value to the archfeologist, to the historian, and the geologist, and

prove how close is the intimate bond of union between three branches of
human thought which at first sight appear remote from each other.

    investigating the Rate of Increase of Underground Temperature

    downwards in various Localities of Dry Land and under Water.
   Drawn up by Prof. Everett, D.C.L., Secretary.

In last year's Eeport a very interesting series of observations was recorded,
taken in the great well of La Chapelle at Paris, by Messrs. Maugct and
Lijipmann. The temperature recorded showed a tolerably regular increase,
at the average rate of 1° Falir. for every 94 feet, down to the depth of 600
metres. In comparing the temperature at this depth with that at the bottom
of the well, 60 metres lower, an increase about four times as rapid was

found.

   The Secretary has since visited the well, and witnessed, with the advan-
tage of Mons. Mauget's explanations, the very interesting operation of
boring. From subsequent calculation, based on the data thus obtained, he
has been led to concvir in the explanation originally given by Messrs. Mauget
and Lippmann of the abnormal increase in the last 60 metres.

   The Avell has in its lower portion an internal diameter of 1-35 metre, and
consequently a sectional area of 1'43 square metre. The boring is executed by
means of a kind of chisel, whose edge is a convex arc of a circle. This chisel,
with its frame, weighs 3000 kilogrammes. It is lifted and dropped by means
of a series of iron rods screwed together, so as to form one rod 660 metres
long. The arrangements are such that, when the chisel has been lifted -4
of a metre from the bottom, it becomes automatically released, and falls back
through this distance. The rod is then lowered after it through an equal or
slightly greater distance ; and, by another self-acting arrangement, the tool
becomes again attached ready for a new lift. The rods are hung from one
end of the beam of an engine, which takes two seconds to rise, and the same
time to descend. The tool is therefore droj^ped fifteen times in a minute.

   When this work has been going on uninterruptedly for several hours, the

tool is raised above ground, and a cylindrical vessel, with a number of valves

in its bottom, is lowered for extracting the mud and chips which have been

produced by the operation above described. As three hours are required either

for raising or lowering, a considerable portion of the twenty-four hours in each
day is occupied by these subsidiary operations ; and for some time previous
to the observations detailed in last year's Eeport, the time actually spent in
using the chisel was about 100 hours per week.

   Hence we have the following calculation for the heat developed by the
action of the tool. The weight of the tool in air is 3000 kilogrammes. Its
weight in water may be assumed to be ^ of this. Hence the work done in

raising it through -4 of a metre is 1050 kilogrammetres. Heat equivalent to
this is generated in its fall ; and as 424 kilogrammetres of work are equiva-
lent to one kilogramme degree Centigrade, we have 2-48 kilogramme
degrees Centigrade, or 4-46 kilogramme degrees Fahr. as the product of each
fall of the tool ; that is to say, one kilogramme of water woiild be raised in
temperature 4°-46 Fahr. by the heat produced in one fall. The number of
ON UNDERGROUND TEMPERATUHE.                                    253

falls ia a week was 15x60x100=90,000, representing 401,000 kilo-
gramme degrees Fahr. Now, the sectional area of the well being 1'43 sqnare

metres, and a cubic metre of water being 1000 kilogrammes, the weight of

water in each vertical foot is 1430 kilogrammes. The heat generated in one

week's woi-k would therefore heat, by 1° Fahr., as much water as occupies a

height of ^^i^§-g-^= 280 metres, and the heat generated in one day would

Aheat a column of the height of 40 metres to the same extent.  large

portion of this heat is removed by the extraction of the mud, which, on

coming to the surface after its three hours' passage through the water, is
found (as stated in last Report) to have a temperature of from 118° Fahr. to
194° Fahr. ; but the quantity of heat remaining must assuredly bo sufficient

to keep the bottom of the well higher by some degrees than its natural
temperature. The temperature actually observed on June 15, three days
after the cessation of the boring operations, was about 2|° greater than the

natural temperature as computed fi-om the observations at other depths in

the well ; and the temperature observed on June 18 was exactly the same

as on the 15th ; whereas the temperature at a point 60 metres higher had
fallen by "4 of a degree. These circumstances were mentioned in last year's

Report as difficult of interpretation, since one would have expected to find
the greatest change at the bottom, where the artificial disturbance of the
temperature had been greatest.

It must, however, be borne in mind that the operations of boring, including

the raising to the surface and reloweriug of the boring tool and the extracting

cylinder, both of which are nearly as large in section as the well itself, have
a tendency to mix together the waters at different levels, and to prevent a

sudden increase of temperature in approaching the bottom. Judging from

the temperature of the mud, as above stated, it is probable that, during

the boring operations, the solid rock surrounding the miid had, to the thick-

ness of a few inches, a temperature not less than 100° Fahr. The

temperature observed at the bottom on June 15, was 83:]^° Fahr., which,
though exceeding by 7|° the temperature of the water 60 metres higher, must

have been lower than the temperature of the rock immediately surrounding

the bottom. It is therefore quite possible that after three more days of

stagnation, the water at the bottom, situated between these two opposing

influences, may have retained its temperature unchanged, while the water

60 metres higher showed a fall of temperature, from the discontinuance of the
stirring processes which had previously enabled it to borrow heat from below.

   It would appear, then, that, in computing the mean rate of increase down-

wards, the temperature (75°-4) observed at the depth of 600 metres (June 18),
is to be preferred to the temperature observed at the bottom. Employing

as the other term of comparison, the temperature 58° observed at 100

metres from the surface, the rate of increase obtained is 1° Fahr. in 28*7

metres, or in 94-3 feet. If, however, instead of the temperature at 100

metres, we employ the permanent temperature of the caves iinder the Paris

Observatory, which is ll°-7 Cent, or 53°- 1 Fahr., -with a depth of 28 metres,

we obtain a rate of 1° Fahr. in 25-6 metres, or 84 feet.

  A few months after the observations above discussed, the boring was again

interrupted by caving in, and has not yet been resumed ; but preparations
are being made for tubing the well through its whole depth, the previous

tubing having been carried only to the depth of 139 metres. In the mean
time M. Mauget has promised to take another set of observations before the

water is disturbed.

[This promise has been redeemed, since the reading of the Report, by the

having been allowed to the thermometer. The reading in these repeated
experiments at 644 feet, with ample time, was a normal one between tho
readings above and below."

    It having been ascertained that the slipping-down of the mercurial index,

which has often occurred in the Phillips thermometers supplied to the Com-
mittee by Casella, was owing to their bore being less fine than in the origintd
instrument as designed and constructed by Professor Phillips, two thermo-

meters of finer bore were ordered from Casella ; and they have been found to

--exhibit as much stiffness in the index as is desirable so much so that diffi-

culty is sometimes experienced in shaking the index down to its place when
the instrument is to be set. The thermometers thus constructed have the

advantage of great qi\ickness of action, as compared with the large-bore
Negrettis which are in \ise by the Committee ; but the excessive fineness of
the bore sometimes occasions difficulty in reading. The instrument, in fact,

could scarcely be put into the hands of any one but a skilled observer.

   Two thermometers were supplied to Mr. "Willett, the Honorary Secretary

for the Sub-Wealdeu bore which was commenced last year at Netherfield.
One of them was a Negretti, the other one of the new fine-bore Phillips
thermometers above described : the former alone was used. The first
observation was taken in April of the present year by Mr. Bosworth, the
engineer of the boring, and showed a temperature of 68 1° Fahr. at the depth
of 168 feet, the temperature of surface-springs as tested by the same instru-
ment being 51° F. The Eeport states that the thermometer " appears to do
its work well, and to give reliable results." In a second observation, taken
in Mr. Bosworth's absence, the instrument was broken in hauling up.
Another thermometer of the same kind was then procured from the makers
and an observation taken with it on the 2nd of August showed a temperature

of 62° F. at the depth of 263 feet. No observations were taken except at

the bottom, on either occasion ; and the above numbers show that the heat
generated by the boring-tool was sufficient to produce disturbances of tem-
perature amounting to several degrees.

  --Thermometers have also been supplied for observations in two deep wells

 in Essex namely, one at Witham, 660 feet deep, and another at Harwich,
 originally about 900 feet deep. The commencement of the observations,
 however, has been hitherto delayed.

    There is a well at Comb's tannery, near Stowmarket, which was sunk
 some years ago to the depth of 895 feet, the first 57 feet being clay and sand,
 and the remainder chalk and marl, except about 20 feet of gault and green-
 sand at the bottom. The proprietor, Lankester "Webb, Esq., on being applied
 to, near the close of last year, at once, in the most obliging manner, undertook
 to make observations of temperature in it ; and a l^egretti thermometer was

 supplied for the purpose.

    On proceeding to take the observations, it was found that only the first
 283 feet were available, the remaining portion of more than 600 feet being
 choked with chalky mud. Three sets of observations were taken, with the

 following results :

256 REPORT--1873.

   The well Is full of water to within 24 feet of the surface of the ground,
and is tubed with a 9-inch iron tube for about 90 feet, the top of this tube
being about 22 feet below the surface of the grouud. The upper portion of
the pipe is surrounded by a bricked well, into which there is a drain coming
from under two Cornish boilers close to the well ; and the water in this

bricked well occasionall}^ rises so high as to overflow into the pipe. This is
probably the cause of the high temperature recorded at 3 feet below the
water-surface. There would appear to be some error in the first observation

at 283 feet; and if this be rejected, an increase of about 1| degree is shown
in descending from the depth of 100 feet to that of 283 feet.

   The source of the water-supply, which is extremely abundant, is unknown,
the only strong spring known to exist in the unchoked portion of the well
being in the sand at the depth of only 30 feet. The circumstances are clearly
not favourable for deducing any certain inferences regarding the increase of
temperature downwards in the neighbouring soil.

   The arrangements for further observations of temperature in the Mont-
Cenis tunnel are now in the hands of Father Denza, of Moncalieri, near
Turin, who wrote to the following effect in April of the present year :

   " Every thing was ready for undertaking the work in the course of last
year, when unexpected circumstances over which we had no control obliged
us to suspend it. It is now our intention to commence work in the summer
on which we are now entering, when I shall determine the temperature, for
which observations the instruments are all in order. The thermometrical
observations will be made in the interior of the tunnel at various depths, and
accompanied by others in the open air on the slope of the mountain accord-

ing to a fixed plan."

   Another Alpine tunnel has been commenced (in the neighbourhood of the
St.-Gothard pass), which Avill be both longer and deeper than that of Mont
Cenis. It has been pierced for a distance of about 300 metres at each end
namely, at Geschenen, about miles from Audermatt on the Swiss side, and at
Airolo on the Italian side. The engineers at the Geschenen end (which waa
recently visited by the Secretary) keep a record of the air-temperature in the
workings. This is found to be higher by 3° Cent, at the distance now reached
than it was in the earlier portion of the tunnel ; but no observations of rock-
temperature have as yet been made.

   Application has recently been made for observations in some of the deepest
mines on the continent of Europe ; and in three instances a favourable answer
has been received. Observations may accordingly be expected from the
mines of the Societe Cockerill at Seraiug, near Liege, from the mines at
Anzin in the Departement du Word, and from some of the deepest mines in
Bohemia. The Secretary desires to acknowledge his obligations to M. Delesse
of the School of Mines at Paris, M. Sadoine of Seraing, M. de Marsilly of
Anzin, and Prof. Zenger of Prague.

    It is understood that numerous observations have been madeduring the past
year with the thermometers sent to Australia. The oificial report, however,
has not been as yet received.

   The Committee have learned with pleasure that a series of experiments have

--been commenced, by Professor Alexander Herschcl and Mr. Lebour, on the

conductivity of difi'ereut species of rock a subject intimately connected with
the inquiry in which the Committee are engaged, and one respecting which
additional information is greatly needed.

Your Committee are glad to bo able to report steady progress in the various
branehes of rainfall work under their supervision. The new stations started

in Scotland, as explained in our last Report, have, with few exceptions, been
carefully attended to. Your Committee desire to record their thanks to the
Directors and Secretary of the Highland and Dingwall and Skye Railways
for the very great assistance already afforded, and which your Committee
hope to render still more valuable by the personal inspection of the stations
by their Secretary at an early date. Gauges have been established at the
following stations on these linos, and continuous records have been received
from all but those marked witli an *.

The returns have been sorted, the angular elevations of surrounding objects
computed, blank forms prepared ; and the tabulation has been commenced on
the plan showii by the following specimen (p. 259),

   "When this tabulation is completed, the information afforded wUl be of the very
highest value; but the labour of discussing the returns (mthout which they are
practically useless) wUl be very heavy, as may be judged by the fact that the
specimen sheet contains only four returns out of the 800 already received.

   Although the mass of information thus produced is so large, the Com-
mittee cannot but regret that a considerable number of the forms have not
been returned, and that it seems probable that those who have neglected to
send them back are the persons respecting the positions of whose gauges
information may be most desirable. Your Committee therefore feel that
there is no alternative but to press forward the personal examination of all
these stations as rapidly as possible. It is satisfactory to them to find that
the views which they have steadily held of the paramount importance of

personal inspection of the stations have not only been recognized and acted
upon by the Meteorological Committee of the Eoyal Society, but have met
with great support upon the Continent.

    At the Meeting of the French Association for the Advancement of Science

-- Woat Bordeaux, September 1872, the following resolution was passed : "

think that rules universally applicable can be laid down for the verification
of instruments, and the inspection of meteorological stations, and we believe
that it would be one of the greatest advantages which can possibly be real-
ized in meteorology." The same subject was discussed at the Meteorological

--Conference held at Leipzig in August last, and the following resolution was

adopted : " It is desirable to make a periodical inspection of the stations
of each system as frequently as possible." In consequence of the issue of

the position-forms previously mentioned, our Secretary has been obliged, both
by considerations of time and money, rather to curtail these personal ex-
aminations ; the number, however, described in the Appendix to the present
Eeport is 54, bringing the total up to 479, to which should be added
those tested by Mr. Buchan with the apparatus presented to the Scottish

Meteorological Society last year, of which, owing to Mr. Buchan's absence
at Vienna, the details have not yet been received.

    It will be remembered that the gauges erected in certain parts of Wales,
and those erected in East Cumberland and Westmoreland by Mr. Symons in
1865, were transferred to this Committee some years back. As some of the
observers have died, and some of the gauges have been disabled, your Com-
mittee have directed their Secretary to go over the district, and rearrange

them as may seem most expedient.

--2G0 REPORT 1873.

The experimental gauges erected some years since at Calne, at the ex-

pense of Col. Ward, and subsequently removed to Strathfield Turgiss and
Hawsker (and of which the results were reduced, presented to this Com-
mittee, and by them inserted in their 1869 and 1870 Reports), have been

finally dismounted and preserved for future use if required, it being consi-

dered that the doubtful points which they were constructed to test have

been thoroughly settled.

During the decennial period, extending from 9 a.m. January 1st, 1860, to

the same hour on January 1st, 1870, there were 317 records of rainfall kept

in the British Isles, without the omission of a single shower. These records
therefore give 38,040 monthly values, or 3170 values for each month of the

year, and afford by far the most reliable basis for investigation into the
seasonal distribution of rainfall ever yet available. Accordingly your Com-

mittee have had them all converted into percentages of the yearly totals at

the several stations, and tabulated in the same manner as those for previous

Wedecades given in our Report for 1868.  give on the present occasion in

Table I. the percentages for each individual station, because it has been

remarked that we have not given monthly averages, and these percentages

afford the means of readily obtaining such averages. It is merely necessary to

shift the decimal point two places to the left to convert the percentage into
a factor for deducing the monthly amount from the mean annual amount

given in the column preceding the monthly percentages. Por example, the first

station is Shrewsbury, of which the mean annual amount was 19-499, and

the January percentage 8-6, which by shifting the decimal point is converted

into the factor -086, and 19-499 X ·086=1-677 in., the computed January

fall. The true January mean at Shrewsbury is 1-675 in. ; and although

the mean, computed by the above method, would not in all cases be in

such remarkably close agreement with the true mean, the difference would

never be of any consequence.

In Table II. we give the means for each group, and, for comparison, the

corresponding values for the previous decade 1850-59, and also the depar-

tures of each group from the mean of each district. These values strengthen

the evidence which we adduced in our 1868 Report of the greater relative

wetness of winter months at western stations, and especially at those of

large rainfall. But though they corroborate the fact of the oscillation, they

rather reduce its amount. For instance, at western stations in England we

have the following monthly percentages for stations at which the average

is 20 to 25 in. :--

         1850-59.                                      1860-69.

   It is satisfactory to find that the general inferences drawn by Mr. Gaster,

--and quoted in our 1868 Report, are so far corroborated by the fuller in-

formation now obtained that, except as hereinafter noted, we may refer to

that Report as giving a fair resumi of the facts in the present, always re-
                                                                                                                           ;

            ON THE RAINFALL OF THE BRITISH ISLES.                                                                          261

memberiiig that the 1860-69 decade has shown the various features in a less

marked degree than the decade 1850-59.

   In order to facilitate an acciirate determination of the months in which

the maximum and minimum rainfall usually occur we have compiled

Table III., which gives the mouths of maximum and minimum respectively

for two complete decades (for England, Scotland, and Ireland), adopting the

same subdivision into districts, and grouping according to amount of annual

fall, as in the previous Tables.

   An abstract of the results of Table III. is given as Table IV.

These two Tables are very instructive, and afford information respecting

the distribution of the epochs of maximum and minimum previously unat-

tainable.

The general features will be better understood by an examination of the

Tables than by any  description                                                 and we  therefore  confine  ourselves  to  re-
                                                                             ;

marking that the essential chfference between the two decades is that in

1860-69 July, as a month of maximum rainfall, has disappeared altogether,

and April has become more frequently that of the minimum. In fact during

the last ten years April has been the di'iest month at most stations in the

British Isles, while in the previous decade this distinction was pretty equally

shared by February and May.

The gradual retardation of the epochs of maximum and minimum as the

annual amount of rainfall increases, is also clearly shown by the upper por-

tion of Table II. ; while in the lower or departure portion of Table II. it is

very instructive to observe the change of sign as the average total rainfall

increases.

With a view to determining whether the same relative monthly values

are found at the same station in all decennial periods, we have selected

seventeen registers, each extending over at least forty successive years, while

four extend over fifty, and one over sixty successive years, and reduced them

in the same manner as the 1860-69 values. These are given in Table V.

and the result can hardly be called satisfactory. They show the same

general features as the two decades which have been discussed in detail,

such as the larger percentages in winter months in wet districts, and in the

summer and early autumn in dry districts ; but the months of maximum
and minimum shift about to an extent which would not be expected, con-
sidering that each value represents the average of ten years. An examina-

tion of these records, all embracing more than one third of a century, proves

that, however steady the ten-yearly average amount of rain may be, its dis-

tribution over the mouths is iiot so by any means; so that, as far as our

present investigations go, it is impossible to lay down any general law as to
the precise month of maximum and minimum fall.

   It has been the custom of this Committee to follow the practice inaugu-
rated by Mr. Symous before their appointment, and give biemiially details
of the monthly faU of rain over the British Isles. As this practice has
several advantages, your Committee are unwilling to depart from it, and
therefore leave the detailed discussion of the rainfall of 1872 until next

year ; at the same time, as the total was in many districts excessive, and in

several localities unprecedented, they have instructed their Secretary to pre-

pare for the Bradford Meeting a map showing the more remarkable general

features, and briefly to explain it. But as the subject will be discussed at

length next year, they do not make cither the map or remarks a part of the

present Keport,

304 REPORT-- 1873.

Seventh Report of the Committee appointed for the purpose of continuing

   Researches in Fossil Crustacea, consisting of Professor P. Martin
   Duncan {M.B. Land.), F.R.S., Henry Woodward, F.R.S., and
   Robert Etheridge, F.R.S. Drawn up by Henry Woodward,

    F.E.S.

Last year at the Brighton. Meeting I was enabled to lay before the Association
a very considerable list of accessions to Fossil Crustacea, and also a goodly
account of work performed.

  A very fruitful season is not unfrequently succeeded by a smaller harvest.

Such is the case with my Report this year ; I am, however, able to show

some favourable results.

   Part Y. of my ' ilonograph on the Merostomata,' containing the suborder

XiPHOsuEA, will be ready for publication before the end of the present year.

 --I have included in it the following genera and species, namely :

Ireland, at Settle and LoUand in Yorkshire, and at Yise, Belgium, referred
to the genus Cydus, namely :

    These last are doubtless either larval forms of other Crustacea, or else they
belong to a pectiliar group whose appearance in time has been exceedingly

limited. They remain for the present among the unsolved problems of

palaiozoology.

   "Whilst referring to the fossil LimuU I would briefly allude to two valuable
contributions to the anatomy of the living Livndus, or " King crab," of the

--north-east coast of iS^orth America : one by my distinguished colleague

and chief, Prof. Owen (see Linnean Transactions, 1873, vol. xxnii. pt. iii.

p. 459, pis. xxxvi.-xxxix.) ; the other by Prof. Alphonse Milne-Edwards (in
the ' Annales des Sciences I^aturelles, Zoologie,' 5th series, tome xvii. 1873,

p. 25, pis. v.-xvi.).

   Limidus polypliemus, and the closely aUicd species common to the Moluccas

and the coasts of China and Japan, are the sole existing types of this ancient
race, whose longevity (as an order) in time is unsui-passed among the Crus-
tacea, save by the Entomostraca alone, NeoUmuhts of the Upper Silurian
of Lanark closely agreeing with the larval stages of the living Limxdus,

called by Dohm the "Trilobiten-Stadium."
                              ON FOSSIL CRUSTACEA.                                                                           305

   By the kindness of Professor Owen I am permitted to add three plates from

his Memoir on the modern American King crab to Uhistrate my ' Monograph

on Fossil LimulL' I have also introduced (from Dr, Packard's and Dr.
Dohrn's works) figures of the larval stages of Limulus pohipliemus ; and

from that of Barrande figures of the larval forms of certain Trilobites, the de-

velopment of which he has traced often (as in the case of Sao hirsiUa) through

more than twenty stages.
   Having read carefully the arguments of Dr. Dohrn, and subsequently

the views of Dr. Packard, the elaborate papers on the anatomy of Lumdtis

by Alphonse Milne-Edwards and Prof. Owen, I find nothing in these several

memoirs to lead mo to distrust the conclusion at which I had arrived in

1866 (see Brit. Assoc. Reports, Nottingham, and Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.
1867, vol. xxiii. p. 28) as to the correctness of associating the Eurtpterida

and XiPHOsuRA under the Order Merostomata, but much to confirm and

strengthen that conclusion.

   Prof. Owen fully concurs in my general views of the Merostomata, as
an order, although he differs from me in some minor points in reference to

the structure of Limulus.

   For example, he considers the anterior shield, as I do, to be the cephalon,

merely proposing for it the term cephaletron* ; whilst for the posterior shield

(which I demonstrated in 1866 to be the conjoined thorax and abdomen) he

gives the name thoracetron ; and to the telsou, or tail-spine, he apphed Mr.

Spence Bate's name of "pleon."

There can be no objection to the term " cephaletron," as proposed by Prof.

Owen, for the head in Crustacea, in contradistinction to that highly special-

ized  division  of the body,  the  " head "  in the  Vertehrata                                               but  I  think  I have
                                                                                                           ;

shown good grounds (in the paper above referred to) for assuming that the

'posterior shield is not merely the thorax (or " thoracetron" of Owen), but the

combined thoracic and abdominal segments, as attested by the larval or em-

bryonal stages of Limulm, and by the fossil forms of the Coal-measures and

of the Silui'ian.

   I venture also to demur to Spence Bate's term " pleon " being restricted to the

tail-spine in Limulus, because it is calculated, if so used, to cause considerable

confusion. The term " pleon," as applied to the Crustacea by its author,
includes the last seven segments of the body, of which the telson (if reckoned
at all as being a segment) can only be assumed to be the ultimate joint of

--the series.
   The view propounded by Prof. Owen that the great caudal spine in Limulus

represents, either by itself or possibly with the hindmost segments of the
"thoracetron" (Owen), the "pleon" of Spence Bate (or in other words the

--last seven (or abdominal) segments usually seen in other Crustacea) is based

on his examination of the innervation of the tail-spine. From its dissection

he finds that the bifid continuation of the great neural axis is divided within
the triangular tail-sheath into a double plexus of fine nerves resembling the
Cauda equina of anthropotomy. In this fasciculus of ncrvc-threads the author
traces nine nerve-filaments, four ventral and four dorsal, the ninth being the

continuation of the bifid neural axis. From this he concludes that the tail-
spine may indicate as many as four coalesced segments, which with the three
posterior coalesced apodal segments of the " thoracetron "' would account for

the missing abdominal series, or the "pleon" of Spence Bate.

* From Ke^aXr/, the head, and rjrpov, apart of the aklomen, in allusion to the fact that

"a part of such cavity is associated with the 'head' in the first division of the King

crab's body, and with the ' thorax ' in the second division." (Owen, op. cit. p. 463.)

306 REPORT-- 1873.

   But, notwithstanding my profound respect and appreciation of Professor

Owen's comparative anatomical studies and his conclusions thereon, I find
great difficulty in adopting this view, because it does not accord ivith those
generally entertained regarding similar structures in other orders of Crus-

tacea ; neither will it harmonize with the earliest known forms of the Xi-
PHosuRA, nor with the larval development of recent Limulus as made known
by the researches of Packard* and Dohrnf.

   Prof. Owen names the small modified bifid median appendage behind the
mouth o{ Limulus the "chilaria"J; this is doubtless the homologue of the

great metastomial plate of Ptenjgotus^.

   Dr. Packard, when contrasting (in his work on Larval Limulus, oj). cit.) the
Mekostomata with the Trilobita, inadvertently calls the " Metastome " the
" Hypostome," and contrasts it with the Hyjpostome in Trilobites, in which no

lower lip exists.

   Referring to the habits of the Pterygoti, Prof. Owen considers they were

those of burrowers like the Limuli ; but their bodies and broad swimming-
feet seem preeminently fitted for natation.

   On the other hand, he thinks IJmulus could not walk well, but only crawl

and burrow. I have frequently seen them alive in the Aquaria at the
Zoological Gardens ; and they walked with considerable ease and activity on
the tips of their toes. They are, however, true burrowers by habit.

   Prof. Owen is willing to accept the theorj' of development of the Mero-
STOMATA from a typical and common life-form, but by " Secondary causes or

laws," 110^ by Natui'al selection (p. 501 op. cit.).
   Several additions have been made to the Carboniferous Phyllopods, the

species of which I have described in conjunction with my friend Mr. Eobert

Etheridge, jun. (of the Geological Survey of Scotland) ; some notice of these
wiU be found in the Transactions of the Sections (C), in a separate paper.

   Of Cretaceous forms I have examined several new species, among which

are three examples of the carapace of a small Gault Crustacean from Polkestonc
(near to Diaulax Carteri, from the Cambridge Greensand), which I have

named Z>. feliceps, two small forms of Scyllariclia, the genus hitherto only
known in the Eocene Tertiary :

  A small Crangon? of doubtful determination, with two delicately serrated

lines on the anterior half of the carapace in front of the nuchal furrow, and
the hinder part armed with very minute spines, the surface of the carapace
being ornamented with very minute and scattered serrations ; the carapace,
hands, and detached body-segments of which are aU of a glistening black
enamel. I have named this Mesocrangon atra ||.

preserved carapace of a small crustacean under the name of Mitliracites vec-

tensis, from the Greensand, Atherfield, Isle of Wight. I lately obtained six
specimens from the same locality, which upon comparison I found to agree

(so far as the figures and desciiption enabled me to determine) with Gould's
Mithracites ; but when I compared the specimens with the receut Mithrax, I

failed to discover the analogy, although the specimens since obtained appear

to oifer a decided affinity with the genus Hi/as. The discovery of these ad-
ditional examples will necessitate the reconsideration and redescription of the
genus Mithracites.

   Fortunately the abdomen and limbs of both male and female examples are
preserved; and the margins of the carapace are also well seen,

   Erom the Greensand, Isle of Wight, I have also obtained a new species of
Hemioon? (Bell), but larger than H. Cunningtoni. From the Hard Chalk,
Dover, I have received a new form of Enoplodytia, which I propose to call

E. scabrosa.

   Only one new species of Trilobite has to be noticed ; it was found at
Utah, and sent over by Mr. Henry S. Poole, Inspector of Mines, Nova Scotia.
I have referred it to the genus Olenus, under the name of Olenits utahensis.

It shows evidence of a median axis, apparently corresponding with the so-
called straight alimentary canal, noticed by Earraude. The matrix is com-
posed of a hydrated silicate of magnesia.

   This completes the list of new forms examined and determined by me,

some of which are already engraved for publication.

Paet II. On the System of Hyperelliptic Differential Equations adopted by
                                Jacohi, Gopel, and Eosenhain.

In this part the solutions of the hyperelliptic differential equations of

the first order, as given by Gopel and Rosenhain, will form the main sub-

ject which I desire to bring before my readers. They will ever possess

great interest, although surpassed in generality by the later researches of

Weierstrass, and the geometrical methods of Riemanu. The researches of

Gcipel and Eosenhain were nearly contemporary ; as, however, those of

Rosenhain are somewhat more elaborated than those of Gcipel, I shall com-

mence with an account of them, as contained in the ' Memoires de I'lnstitut,

par Divers Savants,' torn. xi. p. 361. Rosenhain begins his investigations

by giving formulse for the multiplication of four functions d appertaining to

elliptic integrals, and uses these as a starting-point for the corresponding

formulae in hyperelliptic functions. He then expresses these new functions d

in terms of two new variables, and shows that from the equations thus ob-

tained we can deduce the hyperelliptic differential equations.

     Hence, combining (1) and (2) together, we obtain

(Eosenhain, p. 405).

   In this way formulae are found for the multiplication of hyperelliptic
functions. Two others of a similar nature are given by Eosei^hain, toge-
ther with the expression just written down ; and they are presented in a
somewhat modified form on page 406. The quantities B^ ^ are expressed

by means of functions (p^^ 3 with constant arguments, by a method analogous
to that by which the constants Q^ were determined previously.

 --Section 6. Having thus discussed some of the properties of f^ ^ (y, w),

Eosenhain proceeds to develop a number of similar functions defined as
follows, p. 499 :

It is a good way to prove form (1) by writing down the fully expanded

forms of <p^^ 3, 03 , and then applying the principles of Section 1. Then
Eosenhain has shown how to deduce (2), (3), (4) by merely changing the

--periods.
   Section 7. By increasing the arguments by semiperiods Eosenhain has

deduced an immense number of formulaj, which he has placed in a table at

Wethe end of his memoir.  shall endeavour, first, to explain how this table

Weis formed, and, secondly, how to iise it.  remark especially that if

V, v, v", v" are each augmented by -^, then i\ is augmented by jV, and
Vj', ?'/', Vj'" remain unchanged ; but, on the other hand, if v, v', v" are

augmented by -^, and v'" diminished by p-, then t\, i\', v^' are also in-

creased each by p- and v"' diminished by -^. Again, if while v, v' re-

main the same v" is increased and v" diminished by -^, then v^, v^ also

remain the same, and v^' is increased, v^" diminished by -^. So that the

four equations of section 6 remain true when the variables are thus changed

Mand the functions transformed. Now, then, we will consider the Table.

Formula la consists of the values of M, M', M", M'" written down as
given in section 6. Formula Id is obtained by augmenting w, iv' , iv" by

-^ and diminishing w'" by -,, , formula 2a from la by augmenting v" by -^ and

diminishing v'" by -^ in la, formula 2d from \d by augmenting v" by -^

Weand diminishing v'" by -^ ·  need make no special remarks respecting

3a, 3rZ, 4«, 4f?, which are proved in a similar manner. But when

we come to 5a we meet with a change. The formulte of page 410

(numbered 80), are then called in, and the arguments augmented by the

quantities which render the ratios of the functions doubly periodic, and

which we have  discussed  at full in the third section in reference to ^3    {v, w).

                                                                           3

We thus obtain 5a, and from this, by changing the arguments as before by

adding and subtracting -^, we arrive at 5cZ, 6a, Qd.
  Now consider Qd particularly. It gives us

  +It is easily seen that if we change uti, into zt+4K, w' 4K', or into
+tt+4L, m' 4L', all these series remain unchanged. Hence they are doubly

Iieriodie. Moreover their ratios are quadruply periodic ; for after removing

the common factor ei't^'+ru-^ gjj ^]^q exponents of e in numerator and deno-

minator are linear in ii'a. Hence it is easy to prove that if u, u are changed

into M+4A, M + 4A' when

, ttL f         it             TrLt

4r(KL' -K'L)'       4/(XL' - K'L/

+or if a', u are changed into m+4B, m' 4B' when we have

B= '^'L-, B = - '^^^
"4;-(KL'-K'L)'      4y'(KL'-K'L)'

the ratios of these functions remain unchanged.

   If we suppose «, v' to be augmented by the semiperiods, the quantities P, Q,
&c. sometimes remain unchanged, sometimes change their sign. The resulting
values are expressed by Gopel in a Table, where the first line gives us the

increments of the argument, the remaining lines the resulting signs, thus :

                    2K,  +:2L, :?Iv 2L.

                    --+

                    +

and so on for the remaining fourteen series (Gopel, p. 282).

   When we suppose «'«' to be augmented by the quarterperiods, P, Q, &c.

are changed into other functions of the series, as is expressed in a Table,
where the first line, as before, gives us the increments of the arguments, the

--remaining lines the quantities into which P, Q, &c. are changed, thus :

with many similar formute (p. 288).
   From formulte (1) we easily see that we have an expression of the form

                         P==aP'= + /3S'HyP"= + gS"^

by putting the arguments u, u' equal to zero and the quarterperiods, we
determine a, fi, y, S, and we find

with similar formulae for S^ P'"^, &c., also in terms of                                                                                                                                                                             (4)

   Gopel next investigates the relations which exist between the products

PS, P'S'. By means of Table 1 he proves very easily that such relation must

be of the form

     + + + =+aPS+ 6P'S' cP"S" -I- dV"'S"' eQR+/Q'R' *7Q"R" hQ"'R"' ;

and then, by the help of the second Table, he proves that this equation gives
rise to the two following:

                    aPS +cZF"S'" + eQR =+7»Q"'R"' 0,

               + +ftP'S' cF'S" +/Q'R' (7Q"R" =0.

  =By putting the arguments u, u' 0, and also, making use of equations (3)

of this section, we obtain the following two equations derived from the second

of those we have just written down :

               =k"'p"'Q'U'               ^"V"'FS'-«rffP"S",

                                         ^trP'S'

vejy beautiful method of integrating a certain system of hyperelliptic differ-
ential equations given by Jacobi in the 32nd volume of CreUe's Journal.

   Let

            Yx"~Y^x-'+Y.^x"-'. . . . ±Y,,='Rf + 2Sy + T=0

be an equation represented in two different ways, where Y, Y^ . . . . are, of

course, of the second, and E, S, T of the nth order in y and x respectively.

Then this equation, differentiated, manifestly gives

or

                       L(l+/)+2M*/ + N(l-/-)=0.

we obtain a system of equations which may be regarded as the complete

strass as follows.

Weierstrass's paper (Crelle, xlvii.), or in the first section of the paper we are
now considering, we see that it will be infinite when one of the quantities
x^, x^. . . ..Vp is infinite, and zero when they become equal to ««.

   From this Konigsberger deduces the two equations corresponding to these

conditions :

                           =0(VjVj, .... Vp)              to the first,

and

                           diy^v^. . . .Vp)a=0 to the second,

which last may be written

                                                                                                   l<r .). .

                                                                                         .. . .

  --Konigsberger then states that, if the symbol (1,3.5. ...2p l, e^e^ep) is

called e-, and S being supposed to be any whole number, y equal to every

=symbol of the form Se, and therefore taking 2*" forms, then 6(v^v^,,Vp)^yyi 0,

when v.v,^. . . .Vp vanish, y' and y" being different. To show this we remark

that  the  increments  of  the  arguments            v^v^                          .  .  .Vp  are  partly    numerical,  partly
                                                                                .

consist of definite integrals. When y and y" are different, the numerical

part becomes entire ; and therefore when v,v., . . . .Vp vanish, d vanishes by a

proposition of Weierstrass for the expansion of 0, when the arguments are in-

creased by semiperiods of definite integrals. (See Crelle, xlvii. p. 30.) When

y and y" are the same, they counteract each other and produce no effect.

From these considerations Konigsberger deduces the values of the coeffi-

cients (a)*.

   I shall illustrate the Table, p. 28, by deducing from the last equation

of p. 27 :--

tion 2). Since we are dealing with hyperelliptic functions of the first order,

Cj and e^ wiU become and 2 ; hence y becomes in succession in the four

=terms of the formula, 5, 0, 2, 02, ya/3 (omitting /3=5 and y 5), 1, 01, 12,

012, or 1, 01, 12, 34, as we shall see, ae'y becomes 145, 140, 142, 1402, or

14, 23, 03, 3 ; fte'y becomes 545, 540, 542, 5402, or 4, 04, 24, 13, which

give the indices required.

   * Konigsberger has been very brief in this paragraph from Weierstrass. I am not sure

of his meaning. I hope to add sometliing in the Supplement.

    I have worked out this theorem for hyperelliptic fimctions of the first
order; and it appears from this that the demonstration for hyperelliptic
functions docs not differ in principle from that for elliptic functions. I shall
therefore confine myself to elliptic functions, as the length for hyperelliptic
functions is extremely great.

consequence that the periods of one set of these functions can be expressed

linearly in terms of the periods of the other, the coefiicients in these linear

relations, however, being subject to the condition

To illustrate the series of equations next following, I observe :

--Hence, substituting v^ ^ iu the value of d(2v^ .... 2t'p, ^ja.j .... Ifip,

4r,,j. . . .4rp,p) just given, the expression becomes

   ...2(-lf20(2t>^....2t;p, iiu,....i/ip, 4r,.,....4rp,p).                              (A)

From this series of equations values are deduced for

             0(2v,....4r,,,....)  and      0(2i»^.  .  .    iyu,.  .  .  .4r,,,)

Modifying this by the equation for 0(2?;^.. -^.Ar^^ j), which we have

   From this formula Konigsberger deduces three modular equations for

as this number is taken with one exception, the number of terras in the first
member of these equations is 2, the four terms in the second member corre-

 --Section 2. For the purpose of solving these equations, a Table similar to

that we have endeavoured to explain at the end of oui- remarks on section 3
of Konigsberger's first memoir is constructed ; using the same notation, we

have

                  elF.Q^ =-p'S +piqU+Flql ~pUq\>

These three equations, combined with the last three equations of section 1,

manifestly give the following :

               + +e(t«', Wj, if'j M'J, d{iv\--n\, iv\--w^\ =0,
              =6(w\+iv^, iv\+wX^^e(iv\--tv^, tf'j-- tfj)i,3 0,

which reduces the problem to the solution of

                         --0(w', ii',, w\--w^\ =0,

                                   e{iv\--iv^, w\--w^^\ =0,

                         =«(w\-- Wj, w',-- w,\ 3 0.

To resolve these equations Konigsberger enunciates the following proper-

ties :

    If e^e^ are quantities which satisfy the three equations

then also the three following equations are true :

+ + ^ + + ^e(u, e^, t(:, e^)l
          epf,, u^y 6(u^                        e^, u^                                        e^)l  e(u^, wjf

+ + + +e(Mi e,, ttj tfjl d{u^, ujf e(u, e^,u^ e^)l d\u^, mjf

These three formulae are fully proved by Konigsberger, and present no diffi-

culty. They are the result of the equations at the end of section 3 of the

Wefirst memoir and of those at the beginning of this section.                                            therefore

pass on to the theorems next enunciated, namely :

stration will be understood, if we remember that

There are two other papers by Konigsberger on the transformation of hyper-

elliptic functions in the seventieth volume of CreUe, which we hope to con-

sider in the supplement.

At the commencement of his paper Konigsberger aUudes to a paper on

transformation by M. Hermite, in the ' Comptes Reudus ' for 1855, from
which I make the following extracts :

then in employing the above relations to express U.(cc, y) hj entire and

   I wish to remark that the proofs of Dr. "Weierstrass's theorems, given in the

Brighton volume, were obtained by me in the course of the year 1867. I

had no assistance, except that derived from the Memoirs themselves.

346 REPORT 1873.

Report of the Committee, consisting of the Rev. H. F. Barnes^ H. E.
   Dresser (Secretary), T. Harland, J. E. Harting, T. J. Monk,
   Professor Newton, and the Rev. Canon Tristram, appointed for the

   purpose of continuing the investigation on the desirability of esta-
   blishing a " Close Time " for the preservation of indigenous animals.

1. The apprehension expressed by your Committee in their last Report, as
to the probable effects of the Wild-Birds Protection Act, has been more than
justified by events ; for, so soon as that Act came to be applied, it gave almost
universal discontent, and your Committee have not found one person who is

satisfied with it.

   2. In the House of Commons, Mr. Auberon Herbert moved and obtained
the appointment of a Select Committee to consider the subject of the Protec-
tion of Wild Birds.

   3. Three members of your Committee, on being summoned, gave evidence
before the Select Committee of the House of Commons.

   4. The Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons has not,

to your Committee's regret, yet been published, but your Committee have
good reason for believing that it will contain the following recommendations :

       " (i.) That the protection of certain wild birds named in the Schedule of
                      the Wild Birds-Protection Act of 1872 be continued.

       "(ii.) That aU other wild birds be protected from 1.5th March to 1st
                       August, provided that owners or occupiers of lands, and persons
                       deputed by them, have permission to destroy such birds on
                     lands owned or occupied by them.

       " (iii.) That one of Her Majesty's Secretaries of State be empowered to
                       except, in any particular district, any bird from the protection
                       afforded, either by the Act of 1872 or by the proposed Act, if

                        he think necessary to do so.
       " (iv.) That, for the sake of giving better protection to the swimmers and

                       waders, no dead bird, if such bird is mentioned in the Sea-
                     Powl Preservation Act, or the Wild- Birds Protection Act of
                      1872, be allowed, from 15th March to 1st August, to be bought
                       and sold, or exposed for sale, whether taken in this country or
                       said to be imported from any other country.
        " (v.) That any violation of this proposed Act, or of the Wild-Birds
                      Protection Act of 1872, be punished by the payment of costs
                        alone for the first offence, except under aggravated circum-
                      stances, and the payment of costs and a fine not exceeding 5s.
                          for every offence after the first."

    5. Your Committee wish emphatically to condemn these recommendations
as a whole, and all but one of them separately, for the following reasons,
numbered as are the recommendations :

       i. The great majority of the birds named in the Schedule of the Act of
                   1872 do not require protection, as has been shown in former

                    Reports of your Committee ; they therefore think that in the
                   present state of pubhc opinion it is inexpedient that such pro-
                     tection should be accorded to them.
        ii. That for the sake of protecting other wild birds, most of which cer-
                   tainly do not want protection, rights would be continued to
                   owners and occupiers of land which would be denied to other
                   --

          ON THE DESIRABILITY OF ESTABLISHING A "CLOSE TIME," 347

                    persons : consequently the principle of privilege, usually urged

                as one of the strongest objections to the Game Laws of this

                  country, would be introduced into the proposed Act, which would
                 thereby be subject to the attacks of all those who are opposed to
                   those laws. Further, that if there be any need to protect such
                    other wild birds, the need is greater, in most cases, to protect
                  them from the owners and occupiers of land than from other

                       persons.

       iii. That the power to be given to the Secretary of State would virtually
                   be that of repealing the Act, either entirely or in regard to any
                   particular kind or kinds of birds, at his sole will and pleasure,
                   without his acting on the opinion of any responsible adviser or
                   expert assessor; and that in consequence of such unlimited

                 power being intrusted to a high officer of State, who cannot be

                   expected to have any personal knowledge of the intricacies of the
                   questions involved, the results wovild in most cases be highly
                     unsatisfactory to all persons concerned, it being also taken into
                   consideration that the state of the law would vary very consider-
                     ably in different parts of the country, even perhaps in different
                   l^arts of the same county. Furthermore, the granting of such
                   power to any authority presumes that some kinds of birds would
                   be at once exempted from protection, which is tantamount to
                   inviting persecution on such kinds of birds as would be included
                  in what has been termed a " Black List."
       iv. With this recommendation your Committee have the pleasure of

                      entirely concurring.

       V. The anticipation of your Committee, that the penalties imposed by
                   the Act of 1872 would be found insufficient, having been proved
                   by experience to be true, your Committee consider that the pro-

          --posed increase of such penalties is quite inadequate to secure

                efficiency to the new Act -regard, however, beiag had to the

                   indefinite phrase, " except under aggravated circumstances," the
                  meaning of which your Committee cannot explain.

Finally, your Committee wish to point out that, so far as they have the

means of knowing the nature of the evidence given before the Select Com-
mittee of the House of Commons, the four recommendations which they
condemn are directly opposed to that evidence.

    6. The increasing interest taken by the public generally in the question
which your Committee have been now for five years appointed to investigate,
is shown by signs too numerous to mention. Your Committee, however,
observe with regret that in the minds of some persons it has been mixed up,

if not confounded, with other questions which are entirely distinct. Two of

--these maybe specified (1) the Utility of Birds to Agriculturists, and (2) the

State of the Law as regards Cruelty to Animals. Tour Committee not having

been appointed to consider these questions, content themselves with remark-
ing that both are doubtless of great importance to the community, the one
from a moral and the other from a material point of view, but are likewise
entirely outside the duty of your Committee.

   7. In order to assist the clearer view which your Committee hope that the
public will in time take of the question of Bird-protection, your Committee
unanimously beg leave to submit for consideration the following remarks as
to any future legislation :
--348 REPORT 1873.

      (1) However much we may desire it, we cannot in practice stop the
                killing of some birds during the breeding-season : if we pass a

                   law totally prohibiting it, that law will either be evaded, or, if
                  enforced, will become so irksome as to be speedily repealed.

      (2) No law, to be eifectual, should pick and choose certain kinds of birds,

                    leaving out nearly aUied kinds.

     (3) An effectual law, dealing with a whole group of birds, may be passed,

                   as witness the highly successful ' Sea-Birds Preservation Act,'

    A(4) law protecting birds which cannot be shown to want protection

                     is a mistake.

      (5) The crucial test of whether a bird wants protection or not, is whether
                 its numbers are decreasing or the contrary.

      (6) With some very few exceptions (nearly each of which can be satis-
                factorily explained), none of what are commonly known as
                " Small Birds " are decreasing throughout the United Kingdom

                      generally.

      (/) Most "Small Birds" are generally increasing in numbers, some
                  remarkably so.

     (8) Setting aside " Sea-Birds," which may now be considered safe, no
               birds have so much diminished in numbers as " Birds of Prey"

                 and " Wild Fowl."

     (9) No law for the protection of " Birds of Prey," if passed, could be at

                    present carried out.

   A(10) law protecting "Wild Fowl," if passed, could be carried out

                  effectually, provided that the penalties are in proportion to the
                 inducement to break it.

   (11) "Wild Fowl" form a group subject to great persecution on account

                  of their marketable value, especially as articles of food : they are

               commonly kiUed (many of them because then more easily killed)
                long after they have paired and have begun to breed ; they, be-
                sides, lie under the same disadvantage as do the few " Small

         --Birds " which are decreasing the diminution, namely, through

                  agricultural improvements, of their breeding-haunts : already

              many kinds of " Wild Fowl," which a few years ago used to breed

                 frequently and regularly in this country, have ceased or nearly
                 ceased from doing so : they are perfectly innocuous ; consequently
               " Wild Fowl " are eminently deserving of protection.
   (12) The principle of what has been called a "Black List," favoured by
                some persons, would be the most fatal step of all in Bird-
                Protection, since it would discourage, if not entirely check, the
                healthy feehng which is steadily, if not rapidly, growing in favour

              of many birds which have long been persecuted.

 8. Your Committee respectfully urge that they may be reappointed.
OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.  349

Report of the Committee, consisting 0/ James Glaisher, F.R.S., of the
   Royal Observatory, Greemvich, Robert P. Greg, F.G.S., and Alex-
   ander S. HerscheLj F.R.A.S., on Observations of Luminous
   Meteors, 1872-73 ; drawn up by Alexander S. Herschel,
    F.R.A.S.

The observ.ations of meteors and shooting-stars collected during the past year
have been of a more than usually interesting and varied character. The
number of lai'ge meteors is more considerable ; and the ajjpearances of ordi-
nary shooting-stars have presented themselves in a more striking manner as

regards the explanation of their origin, than has often been the case in former
years. Of the meteors which have thus appeared, the Committee have ob-

tained much accurate information ; but the extent of the knowledge acquired

oQ all hands of the origin of these bodies has advanced so rapidly with the
increase of such observations, that a smaller space for discussion of the indivi-
dual descriptions can be occupied in their Eeport than the Committee have
hitherto been able to bestow iipon them ; and a more complete reduction of

the separate observatious will accordingly be attempted when the oppor-

tunities of the Committee allow of their closer examination. Those meteors,
however, which have been observed simultaneously at more than one ob-
serving-station, have been selected from the collection for transcription in
suitable columns in this Report ; and a list of large meteors is added, among

which some have occurred that have without doubt been noticed, and may

have attracted attention, in other directions than has hitherto come to the

knowledge of the Committee. Two of the largest fireballs seen in Great

Britain were atrolitic, or bm-st with the sound of a violent explosion, on the
cJrd of November and 3rd of February last, over the interior of Scotland and
over Manchester and its neighboui'hood respectively. The descriptions of
these two meteors are not so accurate and complete as to admit of very
useful repetitions of all their details. Acrolitic meteors and aerolites have also
been noticed in the scientific journals of other countries, which have given
rise to experiments on the composition of aerolitic substances, both chemical
and microscopical, the conclusions of which continue to extend the range of
our speculations regarding the origin of these bodies. Thus the existence of
carbon and hydrogen in the atmosphere from which the largest iron meteorite
yet found (on the shores of Greenland) was projected, confirms the discoveries
of Graham and Dr. Mallet, of the existence of those gases in other meteoric
irons which have recently been examined, and off'ers proofs of a relationship
between meteorites and comets (in whose spectra carbon has been recognized
as an ingredieutj which it will be interesting to pursue with further expe-
riments and observations.

    The past year was distinguished by the occurrence of a most remarkable and
striking star-shower on the night of the 27th of November last, to tlie expected
appearance of which astronomers were looking forward with especial attention,
from the unexplained absence of the double comet of Biela (to which it

belongs) at the time of its expected returns in the last three of its periodical

revolutions. The probability of the comet's path being marked by a meteoric
stream, into which the earth might plunge on or about the i^7th of November
«very year, was already become a certainty by the obsei-vation by Zezioli,
of Bergamo, of such a meteoric shower on the 30th of November, 1867,
no doubt of whose belonging to the path of the missing comet could possibly
be entertained. The exact date of the shower could not be foretold with
350 REPORT--1873.

certainty, from tlie want of recent observations of the comet ; but every pro-

bability of its being seen was favourable to its reappearance last year ; and

those who awaited it, as well as many unexpectant watchers of meteor-showers,

were surprised by the display of shooting-stars which it suddenly presented

at the first approach of darkness, on the evening of Wednesday the 27th of

last November. The cloudy state of the sky unfortunately prevented ob-

servers throughout the south of England from witnessing the sight ; but in

Scotland and north of the Midland Counties in England many uninterrupted

views of it were obtained. In Europe, Asia, the Mauritius, and in North

and South America observers were equally fortunate in recording its appear-

ance ; and few great star-showers have hitherto been more satisfactorily ob-

served, as well as more abundantly described. In an astronomical point of

view, the agreement of the time and other circumstances of its appearance

with the supposed path of the lost comet is so exact as to prove that the

calculations made by astronomers of that comet's orbit cannot be affected by

any errors of a large amount ; and a proof almost certain is thus obtained

that the disappearance of the comet is owing to no unexplained distur-

bances of its path ; but that, like some former comets of variable bright-

ness, it has not improbably faded for a time out of view, and that at some

future time a reasonable expectation may be entertained of rediscovering

the missing comet pursuing its original path in repeated visits to the earth's

neighbourhood and to the field of telescopic observations.

Only partial views of the ordinary periodical meteoric showers of De-

cember, January, and April last have this year been obtained, of which some

descriptions are added to the close of this Report. Reductions of the scat-

tered meteor-observations on ordinary nights of the year are an important

subject of the Committee's inquiries, which have been kept in view in their

operations of the past year. Captain Tupman having obligingly placed a list

of nearly 6000 such observations (made by himself) at their disposal, the

greater part of which he has reduced to their most conspicuous radiant-

points, this special object of the Committee will be most effectually assisted

by the publication of the valuable meteor list which has thus unexpectedly

Acome into their possession.  graphic projection of the radiant-points has

been prepared, which will be printed as an illustration of the copious infonna-

tion that will be gathered by observers from the contents of Captain Tup-

man's list. The catalogue will be distributed this year to observers interested

in the research ; and to enable useful meteoroscopic charts to be added to it,

it is hoped that the Members of the British Association will continue to assist

the Committee with such liberal communications of their observations as

they have hitherto supplied.

                                      APPENDIX.

                                 I. Meteors Doubly Observed.

    In the section of the last Report corresponding to this Appendix, a con-
siderable list of simultaneous observations of shooting-stars in the August and
other meteor-showers of the previous year was presented of which no calcu-
lations had at that time been undertaken. The attention of the Committee

having been much occupied during the past year with the questions and cor-
respondence relating to the unusual meteor-display of the 27th of November

last, their intention of calculating these meteor correspondences has not been

carried out ; and a large addition to the number of duplicate observations of
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I  351

352 REPORT-- 1873.

shooting-stars in subsequent meteor-showers has in the mean time been col-

lected, of which (for the same reason) it is only possible to offer in this Eeport

the materials for such a future computation of their comparative results. The

following list contains the particulars of a great many such observations, of

which the Committee are obliged for the pi'esent to leave the calculation to

a  more  convenient  opportunity                                                     and a few results obtained by a rapid gra-
                                                                                  ;

phical projection of the paths of a few conspicuous meteors of the list at

the moment when the observations were received, are all the results of their

final comparison together which the Committee are now able to present.
   Two bright meteors were seen, one at Glasgow and one in South Wales,

on the night of the 9th of October last ; and again two separate meteors, no

less bright, at Glasgow and its neighbourhood, and at Bristol and Portsmouth

on the night of the 3rd of November, 1872. Of the latter two meteors only,

duplicate observations were received ; and the observations on this night ap-

pear to indicate an extraordinary frequency of bright meteors. Thus at

Milngavie, near Glasgow, " On Sunday evening (November 3rd) a shower of

exceedingly brilliant meteors was observed falling ; one of these was particu-

larly brilliant, &c." It appeared in the north, and left for a second or two

a line of light resembling the tail of a comet. The description of the meteor

is the same at Leshmahagow, where it is added that, after being observed, it

remained in one position and thereafter took an onward course with a rapid

flight westwards until it was exhausted. The pause in its flight and the ac-

companying tail of sparks are well described by Mr. M'Clure in the list

of duplicate observations. The daily newspapers at Glasgow describe it as

passing there from east to north-west or west, appearing as a large bluish

fireball with a long tail consisting of coruscations of red light. The Eev.

A. Johnson, of Cambuslang, near Glasgow, describes it as of yellow colour,

moving about 45° above the horizon from a little south of east to north of

west, throwing out a red tail and brilliant bluish and greenish sparks as it

seemed to curve downwards a little in the latter part of its course. The re-

maining description at Melrose of this meteor's appearance (see the list) is too

imperfect to afford, with Mr. M-Clure's account at Glasgow, a definite conclu-

sion of its height ; but the interrupted speed and curved course which seem

to have marked its motion there, probably signify that the meteor's flight, as

seen at Glasgow, was foreshortened near its radiant-point, and that this point

was accordingly near Perseus, Andi-omeda, and Auriga. This meteor detonated,

being seen and heard to explode at the same time in the north of Scotland.

Tt appeared at half-past five o'clock. The observed paths of the next large

meteor on the same evening at Portsmouth and Bristol at a quarter past nine

o'clock, proceeded from the same radiant-point, and, together with a few ob-

servations of bright shooting-stars on the same date observed elsewhere, mark

the neighbourhood of a point near (3 Pcrsei at about R. A. 45°, N. Decl. 35°,

as roughly representing a region of radiation of the bright meteors recorded

on this date. On the night of the 30th of October Mr. Backhouse noticed a

great many meteors at Sunderland, four of which had a radiant-point in Cas-

siopeia at 0°, 4- 55° ; eight or ten others diverged from near y, \ Ceti (at

about 40°, -t- 6°), and a few others apparently from near e Piscium (at about

14°, -\- 7°), all of their radiant-centres being in the neighbourhood of the above-

mentioned radiant-regions. Besides these. Captain Tupman observed a shower

of ten bright meteors in forty minutes on the night of November 1st, with

three others from the same direction in about the same time on the night of

November 3rd, having a definite radiant-point at 56°, -f-24°, close to the place
assigned to a similar meteor system as seen by Mr. Backhouse on the nights

of the 4tli and Gth of Is^vembcr, 1869 (these Reports for 1870, p. 97), coin-
ciding exactly with Heis's radiant R^, and very nearly with No. Ill of Mr.

+Greg's general list (R G) at G4°, 18°. Several meteors from a radiant-point
+nearer to the latter position, at G4°, 20°, were observed by Mr. Denning at

Bristol, on the nights of the Gth, 9th, and 10th of November last. On the first

of these nights a meteor also proceeded from the direction of a radiant-point
in Auriga, at about 85°, 4-27° ; and on the last date Mr. C. E. Baker, at Bristol,

noted five meteors diverging from a common radiant-point near the Hyades, in
Taurus. The whole of these affiliated radiant-points appear to be connected
AWth the well-known shower from near a Tauri, often noticed by observers

during long watches for the Leonids or meteors of the 14th of November,

having its time of maximum from October 30th to November Gth, or in the

first few days of November.
    The next considerable meteor of which duplicate observations were ob-

tained, appeared at about ten o'clock on the evening of the 3rd of February,
1873. Owing to the cloudy and hazy state of the sky, which nearly con-

cealed the moon at many places, the descriptions of its apparent path were

nowhere sufficiently determinate to indicate its real course with great pre-
cision ; but they combine to show that the meteor moved at a lower elevation

than common amongst ordinary shooting-stars, over the northern part of Staf-

fordshire and Cheshire, passing at a height of less than forty miles above
Crewe, and disappearing at a height of less than thirty mUes over a point
between Liverpool and Chester : at some point of this course a violent explo-
sion was produced, the sound of which was heard like the loud boom of a
distant gun or a low roll of thunder about three or four minutes after the
meteor's disappearance. The accounts of its apparent path, and also of the
time and character of the occurrence of the report, are very discordant; but
there appears no doubt that the meteor was a detonating fireball of the largest
class, illuminating the whole country over which it passed with one or two
prolonged flashes of light at least as powerful as that of the full moon, and the
report diff'ering altogether from that of any signal gun, of which it is said that

one took place at about the time of its appearance. Its course may also have

been rather more nearly from east to west, or from over Chesterfield to above
C'hester, than that above described, the best descriptions at Manchester and
Sheffield stating that it vanished at its extinction near and directly above the
moon, which was then shining in the west. The light of the m.eteor was

bluish, with a train of many brilliant sparks in its track ; and it burst into
many fragments, but without leaving any visible streak of light in its course.
Mr. Greg, Mr. Wood, and Mr. Sorby have collected numerous descriptions of

this meteor's appearance at Manchester, Birmingham, and Sheffield ; but the
definite results to which they all point, scarcely vary sufficiently from the
above general conclusions to make their separate enumeration necessary to
complete this notice. It is remarkable, as observed by Mr. Wood, that on
the same date and at the same local time of the evening, a very brilliant fire-
ball was visible in Australia, of which a description appeared in the ' English

Mechanic ' of May 2ud, 1873, p. 171.

         Ill the ' Monthly Notices of the Astronomical Society ' of the past year

         (vol. xxxiii. ), several interesting instances of very large meteors are recorded.

         The earliest having occurred nearly on the same date of the year as tlie well-

         known fall of the meteorite of Orgenil (on the 14th of May, 1867), it may

         very possibly have been, as its description renders probable, an aerolitic fire-

         ball. It is thus described by Commander BL. P. Knevitt, as observed on

         board of H. M. S. ' Fawn,' on the passage from Manzanilla to Panama.

         " On the IGth of May, 1872, at 2'> 45" a.m. (the weather having been squally

         since midnight), a phenomenon was seen in the heavens at an altitude of about

         50°, and bearing East of compass ; the ship at the time being in lat. 14° 55' N.

         and long. 99° 58' W. I did not see it myself, but the following is the de-

         scription given of it by Lieut. Cecil G. Home, who was the officer of the watch.

         Attention was first drawn by a very bright flash, resembling a small flash of

         vivid lightning, but being much more solid                                                          and      lasting four to five seconds
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

         the passage of the luminous body w^as towards the horizon for a short distance

         (say 3° or 4°) in a zigzag course ; it then appeared to burst and throw ofl^ a

         tail such as a comet has, the tail forming a ring and spreading itself round

         the body till the whole had very much the appearance of a large Catherine-

         wheel ; it then gradually faded out of sight, having been visible from first

         to last about ten or fifteen minutes."

         A large meteor observed at the Mauritius at about 7 o'clock r.]\i. on the 7t]i

         of JSTovember, 1872, by Mr. W. Wright, is described at p. 176 of the same

         volume, being communicated to the Astronomical Society by Mr. Meldrura.

         The appearance of the meteor was exactly like that of the moon in her first

         quarter, the lower quarter only of the disk being illuminated and the upper

         three quarters being of a dull dusky stone-brown colour. The writer's atten-

         tion was drawn to it by a sudden flash above the brightness of moonlight

         and it appeared to him to fall from the direction of Aquarius. In communi-

         cating this observation to ' K'ature ' of January 23rd, 1873, Mr. Mcldrum re-

         marks that the moon was actually at the end of her first quarter, in the posi-

         tion indicated by ^Mr.AVright as the direction in which he observed the meteor;

cannon had been at ouce discharged at a distance of a quarter of a mile.

But the last lighting up of the sky seemed only for an instant, when all was

as dark as before          There must have been a meteor of extraordinary

size travelling from the southern part of Banffshire on towards the centre of

Inverness-shire, and bursting somewhere near the source of the river Nairn.

The brilliancy of the light was as if a brilliant flash of lightning had remained

 --Aerolites. The following extract from a journal of travels in North-west

America, 'The great Lone Laud,' by Capt.W. F. Butler, F.E.G.S. (1872),

deserves attention, as the existence of the mass of meteoric iron which it

describes appears to have been hitherto unknown, or unrecorded.
   " In the mission-house of Victoria (on the Saskatchewan river, not far

from its source) there lay a curious block of metal of immense weight ; it was

rugged, deeply indented, and polished on the outer edges of the indentations

by the wear and friction of many years. Its history was a curious one.

Longer than any man could say, it had lain on the summit of a hill far out

in the southern prairies. It had been a medicine-stone of surpassing virtue

among the Indians over a vast territory. No tribe or portion of a tribe

would pass in the vicinity without paying a visit to this great medicine : it

was said to be increasing yearly in weight. Old men remembered having

heard old men say, they had once lifted it easily from the ground. Now no

single man could carry it ; and it was no wonder that this metallic stone

should bo a ' Manito '-stone, and an object of intense veneration to the

Indian ; it had come down from heaven ; it did not belong to the earth, but

had descended out of the sky ; it was in fact an aerolite. Not very long

before my visit, this curious stone had been removed from the hill upon

which it had so long rested, and brought to the mission of Victoria by some

person from that jjlace. When the Indians found that it had been taken

away, they were loud in the expression of their regret. The old medicine-

men declared that its removal would lead to great misfortunes, and that war,

disease, and dearth of buffalo would affect the tribes of the Saskatchewan.

This was not a i^rophecy made after the occurrence of the plague of small-pox

for in a magazine published by the Wesle}'an Society in Canada there appears

a letter from the missionary setting forth the prediction of the medicine-men

mya year prior to  visit.  The letter concludes with an expression of thanks

that their evil prognostications had not been attended with success. But a

few months later brought all the three evils upon the Indians; and never,

l)robably, since the first trader had reached the country, had so many afflictions

of war, famine, and plague fallen upon the Crees and Blackfect as during the

year whicli succeeded the useless removal of their Manito-stone from the

lone hill-top upon which the skies had cast it."

 --Siderite of Augusta County, United States (see * American Journal of

Science' for July, 1872). Analysis of the gases occluded in the iron, by Dr.

J. W. Mallet, U.S. (' Proceedings of the Royal Society,' vol. xx. p. 365).

Both shavings and a small bar of the iron cut and polished cold, and freed

from oil, from the most solid part of the iron were heated first to redness and

then to whiteness in the vacuum of a Sprcngel pump. The experiment lasted

14^ hours, only a quarter of the whole volume of gas being extracted in the

last two thirds of the time, and a small residue still remaining unextracted

at its close. Tlic quantity of hydrogen and carbonic acid diminished most

rapidly ; and those of nitrogen and carbonic oxide continued to be discharged

Beduced to the standard temperature, 60° F., and barometric pressure, 30

inches, the whole volume obtained was 50-40 cubic centims., or 3-17 times

the volume of the iron, while Grahame found 2-85 times its volume of mixed

gases occluded in the Lenarto iron. The quantity of hydrogen contained in

the Augusta-County iron is 1-4 times its volume, while ordinary terrestrial

iron only occludes about 0-42 or 0-46 times its volume; and the meteoric

origin of the mass is thus confirmed. But the quantities of carbonic oxide and

carbonic acid, especially, are much larger than the corresponding quantities

found by Grahame in the Lenarto iron, and more nearly resemble the pro-

portions found in a sample of a horseshoe nail. It cannot be siipposcd that

the Augusta- County iron has imdergone any artificial process to test or to

improve its quahty ; and hence it may be inferred that the atmosphere in

which it originated as a meteorite was more rich in carbon than that from

--which the Lenarto iron was derived.
   Sidcrite of Ovifak, Greenland. Among the discoveries made by Sir J. C.

Ross in his Arctic voyages, was that of some implements partly made of iron

by the Esqmmaux of Greenland, the metal of which was found on analysis to

be probably of meteoric origin. The ii'on used in their manufacture was

reported by the Esquimaux to exist on the shore of Cape York, some hundreds

of miles north of Disco Island, on the west coast of Greenland. During his

investigations of that coast in the year 1870, Prof. A. E. Nordenskiold, of

Stockholm, by offering rewards for its discovery to the Esquimaux, learned

the existence of such masses of native iron at Ovifak, on the south side of

Disco Isle. Arrived at this indicated spot, Prof. Nordenskiold was there

shown the largest piece of meteoric iron yet known to have been found.

Two other large, and many smaller fragments lay at no great distances from

it. Their site was between high- and low-water mark on the shore, among

sea-worn blocks of gneiss and granite at the foot of a high rock of basalt.

A Swedish vessel transported them to Europe ; and they are now deposited in

the Iloyal Museum at Stockholm. The largest one weighs about 50,000 lbs.,

and the two smaller masses about 20,000 lbs. and 9000 lbs. ; the rest of tho

fragments together weigh about 1500 lbs. Nickel, cobalt, phosphonis, and

sulphur enter into their composition ; and the probability of their meteoric

origin is ably maintained bj' Nordenskiold in his narrative of this expedition

(" Eedogorelse for en Expedition till Gronland." Stockholm: 1871), and in

a later work on the history of the iron. Not many yards from the place of

On heating- the iron strongly in vacuo, carbonic oxide and carbonic acid gas

are given off by the reaction of the free carbon on the magnetic iron oxide
with which it is in contact ; and the amount of oxygen present in the iron is
so great (11-09 of its weight of oxygen,being extracted from it when heated
in hydi'ogen gas), that no lower oxide of iron than that here assumed can be
regarded as its original mode of combination. As octahedra of magnetic
oxide were fovmd by Nordeuskiold in the larger siderites, the highly siliceous
stone appears to be of the same origin as the large iron masses ; and the ad-
mixture of free carbon and magnetic oxide of iron in its composition appears
to indicate that it has never been exposed to a very high temperature, since
its deposition in its present site. (F. Wohler's Analysis of the Ovifak

meteoric iron, Poggeudorff's ' Annalen,' July 1872).

  --Montlivault, Loir-et-Cher, France, 1838, July 22. This and the following

meteorite have lately been added by M. Daubree to the collection in the
Geological Museum of the Jardin dcs Plantes at Paris. The meteorite
weighs 510 grammes ; it has the form of a three-sided pyramid. Its mate-
rial is a finely granular mineral, consisting chiefly of olivine and augite with
grains of niekeliferous iron and magnetic pyrites belonging to the aerolitic

group to wliich the name of leucite has been given. (' The Academy,' May

15th, 1873.)

  --Beuste, Basses-Pyrenees, France, 1859, May. Two pieces of the stone

were found 700 metres apart, the larger weighing 1-4 kilogramme, and the
lesser one 420 grammes. The smaller stone penetrated the ground to the
depth of half a metre ; it is covered with a black crust half a millimetre
thick; and its specific gravity is 3-53. It belongs to the Chantonnite group,
and most nearly resembles the meteorites of Poultousk,. Its grey compact
mass is penetrated in every direction by veins of a black mineral, which
 anastomose and exhibit irregular ramifications. (Ibid.)

  --Shergotty, India, 1865, August 25, 9 a.m. (local time). This stone was

recently analyzed and examined by Prof. Tschermak (' Jahrbuch fiir Mincra-
logie,' 1872, No. 7). The chief mass of the stone is a greyish brown augjtic-
 looking mineral, of which, however, the following analysis shows that it does

 not possess the true augitic composition :

not been observed so definitely hitherto, it has received the name of Maslcelynite

as a new species. Bronzite, magnetic oxide, and sulphide of iron form the

remaining ingredients of the stone, whose mineral and chemical characters
strongly resemble those of the meteorites of Stannern, Juvenas, Jouzac, and
Petersburg, these stones as a class forming a group that is widely separated
from the great majority of ordinary aerolites. (Ibid.)

sections by Dr. 0, Biichuer, of a meteorite which fell in Westphalia in Juno

1870. The principal meteorite, weighing- 2| lbs., struck the earth some

distance from a coimtryman who heard it fall, and, when passing by the same

place two days afterwards, observed the hole where it had penetrated the earth

of a well-trodden footpath to a depth of 2^ feet. It was almost uninjured,

being covered, except at some corners, by the usual black crust. It was

brought, several months after its discovery, to Dr. Heis at Miinster, by whom

small fragment, weighing about 1 oz., was found 300 or 400 paces from the

larger stone ; and no other fragments (the ground having since been tilled)

could be afterwards discovered. The black crust is dull and extremely thin,

its rippled texture and penetration into fine crevices of the stone being only

discernible by means of a magnifying lens. As seen at the fractures, the

interior mass is greyish white, compact, and contains no grains of metallic

iron (which, with ckrome-iron, are absent in this meteorite), but interspersed

yellowish crystalline grains, generally minute, but at one of the exposed sur-

faces reaching to ^ inch, and even to 1 inch in diameter. The microscopic
sections show that this structure is continuous, the whole mass being com-

posed of the same crystalline ingredients in larger or smaller grains. The

specific gravity of the grains is about 3-425, and that of the matrix about

3-405, Chemical analysis also leads to the same conclusion, the separate

crystals being found to have the composition

         Silica.  Iron protoxide.  Magnesia,  Oxides of manga-   Alumina,   Total.

which is also the composition of the matrix. Classing the manganese with
the iron, and the calcium oxide with the magnesia, the mineral substance is

a bronzite, or enstatite (EO, Si 0,), in which the atomic proportion of ii-on
oxide to magnesia is as 4 : 11. This simple composition is almost unique
among meteorites; but the aerolite of Shalka (India, November 30th, 1850),
as analyzed by G. Eose and Eammelsberg, consists mainly of a bronzite

(86-43 per cent., together with olivine 10-92, and chrome-iron 2-11 per cent,),

having almost identically the same composition, viz, :

Silica.  Iron protoxide. Magnesia, Calcium oxide. Sodium oxide.              Total,

55-55             16-53         27-73         0-09        0-92             100-82

The single-silicate composition of the Ibbenbiihren meteorite occurs again
remarkably in the nearly pure bronzite or enstatite materials of the aerolite
of Menegaum (India, June 29, 1843), as determined by Eammelsberg and
Maskelyne, the analysis of the crystalline portion of which (as given by
Maskelyne), fi'om which that of the matrix scarcely differs, was as follows :

         Silica.  Iron protoxide. Magnesia. Calcium oxide.        Total.

         55-70           20-54         22-80        1-32         100-36

atomic proportion of iron-oxido to magnesia, from that of the foregoing

minerals. No examples of terrestrial enstatites present nearly such a high

percentage of iron in their composition as the above specimens of the same

mineral found in meteorites are shown to exhibit by their chemical analysis.

(Tours time). " brilliant meteor j^assed over a spectator stationed betvp'een

Champigny and Bri.say, towards north-east, in the direction of Tours. It

presented the appearance of a spear of flame with two spheres of fire of an

orange colour. The track of one seemed to incline downwards, that of the

other to proceed straightforwards, the whole appearance becoming somewhat

more luminous at the instant that a slight divergence of the course of these

two spheres was first seen. It was lost to sight behind a cloud at St. Maure,

and an explosion was heard at 5'' 26TM. Many observers affirm that they

heard two distinct explosions very near together ; others noticed but one

all testify to the appearance of two meteors pursuing nearly the same path.

A meteorite fell in a field near Lance, Canton of St. Arnaud, and passed a

metre and a half through the light soil into a bed of marl. It weighed

47 kilogrammes [10-i lbs.]. Some fragments separated by the fall were

found near it." (Note by M. de Tastes, presented by M. Ste-Clair Deville,

' Comptes Eendus,' Julv 29th, 1872.)
   " In the last No. of ' Comptes Eendus ' [August 5th, 1872] M. Daubree

records the more recent discovery of a second meteorite at Pont Loisel,

12 kilometres [7| miles] south-east of Lance'. The line joining the two

localities coincides with the direction of the trajectory of the meteors ; and

the Pont-Loisel stone, though much smaller (it weighs 250 grammes [about

|- lb.]) bears the closest resemblance as regards mineral characters to tlio

--Lance stone. The smaller stone fell first [i. e. behind the larger one] a cir-
--cumstance observed in former showers and penetrated the soil to a depth of

only half a metre [about 1|- foot]." (Extract from 'The Academy,' Septem-

ber 1st, 1872.)

   As a phenomenon perhaps connected with the appearance of the Lance
aerolite, it may be added that a large bolide (as described by M. W. de Eon-

vielle, in the ' Eevue des Courses Scientifiqucs ' of Aug. 3rd, 1867) was

visible at Bayonnc on the evening of the 23rd of July in that year ; but no

further particulars of its appearance and of its apparent course were stated.

A11th, and was visible at Home, Velletri, Naples, and Palermo. more remark-

able one was seen at Rome on the morning of the 31st, at 5** 15TM a.m., as a

bright reddish fireball appearing near the S.S.W. horizon, and disappearing in

the E.N.E. It moved slowly at first and then rapidly, expanding as it advanced

to the form of a cone with a rounded base, and flaring up at disappearance

with the emission of several bright lines, which were not seen by all the ob-

Aservers.  train of light lilie smoke remained upon its course, which shone

as if illuminated by the sun's rays, although the sun had not yet risen. The

sound of a violent explosion was heard a few minutes later which shook the

windows of the houses. This was more hke the dull heavy sound of the ex-

plosion of a powder-magazine than like thunder ; and it was followed by a
rumbling sound like that of distant musketry. Father Secchi heard the

noise, but did not see the meteor. It was, however, also seen at Vitcrbo and

AVeroli ; and the explosion was there heard quite as loud as at Rome.

regards the occurrence of this meteor as one of the most interesting appear-

ances of the kind on record. [Several other stones fell, weighing from less

than an ounce to one or two pounds, and the largest were found near Orvinio,

  -- --Italian Observations. 1838, June 23rd. The No. for June 1869 of the

' Bullettino Meteorologico ' of Urbino contains the following citation by Prof.
Serpieri of a passage of the scientific works of Count Joseph Mamiani
(Florence, 1845), where he describes, in six letters to Arago, the meteoro-

Alogy of Pesaro. " few minutes before the occurrence (about 9 p.m.) of a

very violent earthquake in that part of Italy on the 23rd of June, 1838,

many shooting or falHng stars were seen coming from the east ; and they

disappeared, gliding with their accustomed swiftness towards the south.

They were pretty bright, of large volume, and appeared in such unusual
numbers that people in Pesaro asked each other if fireworks were being dis-

charged in some part of the town." Additional observations of this shower,
or of its returns, if they can be traced, will be of great interest and im-

--portance.
   1871, August 9-llth. As seen at most of the Italian stations, it was

observed that the frequency of the meteors in this annual return of the
August shower was nearly equally great on the nights of the 10th and 11th,

and the time of the maximum abundance was variously estimated as having

been shortly before, or at some time after, sunrise on the morning of the
11th of August. Thus, at Cosenza Signer Bassani (assisted on the first night
by Signer Scrivani) counted the following numbers of meteors in the half

If the numbers seen in the first night are halved (having been reckoned by

two observers), it wiU be seen that they were scarcely less abundant on the

second than on the fii'st night of the shower. The numbers seen at other

places on the night of the 9th of August were much less than those counted

Aon the nights of the 10th and 11th.        large number of the meteors seen

were very bright, many descriptions of considerable fireballs occurring in the

long accounts of this August star-shower collected in Padre Denza's ' Bul-

lettino Meteorologico ' of the Moncalieri Observatory for August to November,

1871, from which these notes of the star-shower are extracted. From the

above list of observed hourly numbers. Signer Bassani concludes that the

hour of maximum abundance of the meteors at Cosenza was during daytime,

at about lO* 34'" a.m. (local time) on the forenoon of the 11th. Padre Secchi

at Eome and Prof. Galli at Yelletri also consider it to have taken place

during daytime of the 11th ; and by comparing together all the descriptions.

Padre Denza regarded it as occurring between 2^ and S'' a.m. on the 11th,

irrespective of the effect of the rising moon in greatly diminishing the

Anumber of the meteors visible after that hour.  pecuharity of many of

the brightest meteors was observed that they disappeared, and then again

reappeared further on upon their course. The number of sporadic meteors
was also greater than usual, being about one third of the whole number seen

at Velletri in place of one fourth part, as was recorded in August 1869. The
horary numbers of the shower at Velletri on the 11th of August, 1871, were

greater than on the corresponding night (with an equally clear sky) in the
year 1869, in the proportion of 102-2 to 67-5. The reduction of all the obser-
Tations made for the determination of the radiant-point is being undertaken

    The November Shower in 1871. In the same journal of Italian observations
for December 1871 and January 1873, a few notices of observations of the
November shower in 1871 at Italian stations are described. The sky was in

general overcast, or nearly so, and few extensive watches could be kept. It

was, however, found in Italy, as in England in that year, that the number of
meteors from Leo seen on the nights of the 12th and 13th scarcely exceeded

that of the unconformable meteors seen on the same nights. The time of

central passage of the earth through the stream on the morning of the 15th

(see the last volume of these Reports, p. 96) appears to have escaped obser-
vation at the Italian stations, the sky on that morning having been every-
where overcast.

   Meteor-shower of August 7th-12t7i, 1872.---Observations of this shower were
communicated to the Committee from most of the observers usually recording

their notes of such phenomena for the British Association, by the staff of
Mr. Glaisher's observers at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, and by Pro-

fessor Main's assistants at the Radcliffe Observatory at Oxford. The sky
was completely overcast, with wind and heavy rain, on the night of the 9th

of August ; but with exception of this interruption a long list of observations
of the shower was recorded on the other nights of its duration. The accom-
panying Table shows that the apparent paths of 447 meteors were mapped,

of which nearly the same numbers were seen on the nights of the 10th and

11th by about the same numbers of observers watching for nearly the same

time, in equally favourable conditions of the sky. Many of the shooting-

stars were very bright, but the shower was not so conspicuous in the number

of bolides, and of other meteors of all descriptions, as it was in the previous
year. About twenty-five of the meteors seen were doubly or triply recorded

by observers at distant stations, enabling their real paths to be computed,

and a list of these simultaneous observations wUl be found in the foregoing

catalogue of such residts. The whole of the recorded tracks have been more

or less completely projected upon graphic charts ; but it has not yet been

found possible to determine very clearly the predominating centre of emana-

tion, or the general limits of radiation of the shower from the miscellaneous

groups of evidence which so many valuable independent observations wiU

in the sequel afford. For this purpose a thorough sorting of all the recorded

tracks among the known radiant-points of the epoch wUl be required, for

which sufficient time has not yet been at the disposal of the Committee.

 --Meteor-showers of September-November, 1872. On the nights of the 5th

to 9th of September, 1872, Mr. Clark recorded the paths of several shooting-

stars at York, radiating chiefly from Cygnus and Andromeda, the greatest
number mapped being ten per hour on the night of September 8th.
OBSKBVATIONS OF LUxMINOUS METEORS.  387

    The sky was almost everywhere overcast on the nights of the 18th to 20th
of October, 1872, and the moon shone brightly, so that no useful observations
of the October meteors on this occasion of their annual return could be
obtained, The condition of the sky was equally unfavourable on the annual
date of the November shower of Leonids ; and among the few meteors seen
in this interval, the smaU groujjs noted by Mr. Backhouse at Sunderland on
the night of the 30th of October, and by Captain Jupman at Portsmouth on
the night of the 1st of November*, are the only indications reported to the
Committee of meteors during the mouths of September to November having
been more than ordinarily abundant on any night before the appearance in
the latter month of the bright display of shooting-stars connected with the

recent periodic approach of Biela's comet to the earth.
    The instructions communicated by the Committee to the observers of these

meteoric showers included directions to record any unusual abundance of
meteors observable during the last week from the 23rd to 30th of November,
and to note their radiant-point. The anticipated watch was regarded by all
the observers with attentive interest ; and the first symptoms of an approaching

frequency of meteors was reported by Mr. Jackson of Tooting (Surrey), who,
observing at Hyde Park in London on the evening of the 24th of November,
in four 10"' intervals between 7^ 30TM and 9^ 15TM p.m., saw four meteors as

bright as first -magnitude stars, all diverging from the expected direction of
the Andromedes or Biela's comet meteors. Between 11'' 20" and 12'' 40""
on the night of the 26th of November, the sky being equally clear and star-

light, no shooting-star was visible in an equally attentive watch.
    The occurrence of a distinct shower of the Andromedes on the night of

the 24th of November, 1872, was well proved by the observations of them
obtained in America (' American Journal of Science,' 3rd ser. vol. v, p. 53,
Jan. 1873). They were first seen by Mr. T. Hadley, Prof. Twining, and
Prof. Newton at Newhaven between half-past seven o'clock and midnight on
that night, when their number was about forty per hour for one observer.
Several of their tracks were mapped, and the position of their radiant-point
was estimated by Prof. Newton, at the time, as being two or three degrees north
of the star y Andromedaef- They were also noticed by Mr. Gumniex'e, of

Bethlehem, Pa., on the same night. On the night of the 25th the sky was

more obscured by clouds ; but in comparison with the unconformable meteors
visible at the same time, the frequency of the Andromedes appeared to be
scarcely more than a third of what it had been on the previous night.
During the night of the 26th the sky was quite overcast.

  A correspondent of ' The Field ' newspaper of January 25th, 1873, Mr.

E. L. Layard, adds at the end of an animated description of the Biela comet-
shower, as observed in his vicinity at Para in Brazil, " on the night of the

26th of November [i. e. the 27th, European style] one of my servants
informs me she saw an equally fine display on the 23rd inst." This notice

of the earlier shower in South America evidently relates to the same border-
stream of the Andromedes, observed also by Mr. Maxwell ICaU (' Nature

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ',

March 6th, 1873) in Jamaica, with ahout the same radiant-point on the
night of the 24th. The display of the 27th, Mr. Hall relates was simply a
repetition of a star-shower quite similar to it on the former date.

   The first announcement of the principal display on the night of the 27th of
November was received by Prof. Herschel at Newcastle-on-Tyne, by tele-
graph, from Messrs. Waller and S. P. Thomson at York, and Mr. Backhouse
at Sunderland at about 6 o'clock p.m., when it was also being watched at
most of the observatories and other points of observation in the north of
England and Scotland, whUe an impenetrable veil of cloud unfortunately
prevented all the observers, south of a line drawn from Wisbeach on the
Wash, through Birmingham, from obtaining a momentary view of it in the
south of England. The best series of observations were accordingly only
obtained at a few northern stations, where the sky continued cloudless
throughout the night ; and the rate of frequency of the meteors was thus
counted continuously until the end of the display by Mr. Lowe at Beeston,
near Nottingham, and by Prof. Grant at the observatory at Glasgow. During

     789                10

Hour, P.M. (G. M. T.).

the latter part of the shower a continuous enumeration of the meteors was
also obtained by Lord Ptosse at his observatory at Birr Castle in Ireland.
The numbers counted by other observers in general only applied to very
limited portions of the shower. It was thus observed by Captain Brinkley
and his two sons, near Dublin, that bright meteors were already visible in
fuE daylight on the afternoon, and that about twenty-three per minute could
be counted by one observer as soon as dusk set in on the evening of the 27th,
at about 5^ 20" p.m. Counting alone, Mr. Lowe reckoned that an even
greater number per minute could be counted by one observer at that early
hour. The numbers, however, rose as the hour grew later ; and between
about half-past six and eight o'clock p.m. the shower continued to be visible at
its greatest brightness, declining gradually after this time until an observer
near Dublin, Mr. M. H. Close, looking out for more than a quarter of an

hour immediately after 2 o'clock a.m., with a sky fairly clear for observations

saw not a single meteor in that time. By examining the accompanying

diagram, it will be seen that the curves of meteoric frequency, 1, 2, 3, which
represent the rates of appearance of the meteors observed by Mr. Lowe,
Prof. Grant, and Lord Eosse, all descend towards midnight to the low
average of about five meteors per minute for one observer.

   At about the latter hour (corresponding to 6^ 52"° p.m., Washington mean

time) the shower first began to be visible in the United States of America,
where it was carefully observed by the astronomers at "Washington, by
Profs. Newton and Twining at Newhaven, by Mr. Marsh at Philadelphia, and

by many other observers for some hours, with a view scarcely obscured by
clouds. The following rates of appearance for a single observer are derived
(as nearly as such reductions can be made by the convenient table supplied
for this purpose by Prof. Newton ; see these Eeports for 1867, p. 412) from
the numbers counted by the party of observers at Newhaven, and by Mr.
Marsh at Philadelphia ; and the correspondence, if not complete, yet shows
that the rate of appearance of the meteors at the commencement of the

shower in the United States of America, did not differ very greatly from that

observed nearly at the same absolute time in England, when the most long-

enduring series of observations there of their decreasing frequency towards
midnight were discontinued.

   During the height of the shower various maxima occurred, the principal
of which were seen by the English observers shortly before 7, and shortly
after 8 o'clock p.m., with a less marked maximum between them. The

greatest disagreement and uncertainties of the observations relate to the
commencement of the shower, which set in and was first begun to be
counted during the departing twilight. But as the sun had set nearly three

quarters of an hour in Italy, and about an hour and a half at Athens when
it disappeared in England, the observations begun at dusk in those more

eastern stations supply materials to complete the curve of frequency towards

its commencement, which may be more fully relied upon than the imperfect
observations made at the same time in Great Britain. In the accompanying

diagram, the curves 4 and 5 represent the numbers of meteors per minute for
one observer, as recorded in Italy by Padre Denza at the observatory of

rate intervals as stated in the original list, reduced in each case to the number that would

numbers in the second Hst are similar average rates for the middle points of the intervals

of his watch, as obtained directly from Mr. Marsh's observations.

Moncalieri near Turin, and by Prof. Carlo Bruno at that of Mondovi in

Piedmont. The curve No. 6 is the average rate of frequency per minute,

as given for each hour of Athens time, beginning from about 4 o'clock p.m.

(G. M. T), in the results of his observations of the shower by Dr. J. F.

Schmidt, the director of the Athens observatory. AU the curves thus shown

are drawn in the figure in their proper relative positions in Greenwich time.

The progress of the meteoric shower was intermittent, or composed of

alternate lulls and outbursts of the intensity of the display which almost

defeated attempts to count the meteors when flights of large numbers of them

often appeared almost simultaneously. The mode of counting adopted by

Professor Grant at Glasgow, and by Professor C. Bruno at Mondovi, of noting

the numbers visible in successive intervals of 5 minutes, fails to show the

rapid oscillations of intensity which took place, while it gives very distinctly

the gradual valuations of the shower. The method adopted by Padre Denza

at Moncalieri was to record the minute and second of time at the end of each

interval in which 400 meteors were counted, and the curve of frequency thus

obtained shows all the sudden oscillations of the shower*. The description

of its appearance by Padre Denza suggests that in the clear Italian sky more

remarkable features attended it than have been recorded in any other
meteoric shower. " Frequently small white or yellowish clouds sprang up in

the clear sky, and after remaining visible for a few seconds disappeared.
Some of these as soon as they appeared dispersed themselves in shooting-

stars, in general minute, but sometimes all of considerable brightness,

radiating towards every side like fragments from a bursting shell. The most

remarkable of them made its appearance suddenly near and north-west of the

radiant-point above Capella at 6'* 35"" p.m., in full view of the observer, Signer

Yergnano, without being preceded by any shooting-star. It formed a round

white or yellowish nebular patch of light, about 2° in diameter, in the appa-

+rent position 71°, 45°. It slowly drifted a short distance towards the west,

becoming elongated and assuming various shapes as it gradually grew fainter

and yellower in colour. At 6*" 50TM its position was near a and X Persii at
57°,-)- 53°, and it disappeared at this place at 6*" 56TM p.m., having been con-

stantly visible for not less than 21 minutes." Similar meteoric light clouds

are stated by Padre Denza to have been seen in the November star-showers

of 1868 and 1869 at Madrid and in the United States, and in the August

meteor-showers of 1867 and 1872 by the observers at Modena and Urbino

a substance of unusual tenuity in such cases perhaps entering the atmo-

sphere, and either emitting some denser shooting- stars at its collision, or

remaining luminous alon« at the point where it first encounters the upper

"Astrata of the air.  more singular appearance, not exemplified in any

former star-shower, took place at about 7*" 30"" p.m., during the greatest

Aintensity of the shower.  cloud of faint greyish light, like a thin veil,

spread itself in one instant over the wide space in Cnmclopardus between the

Pole-star and the Lynx, with its centre at about 55°,-|-66°, and with a

breadth of about 20°, hiding the faint stars in that direction. From this

cloud Signer Vergnano and I beheld with surprise a perfect shower of

meteors of the smallest size falling vertically on all sides, like the slenderest

serpent fireworks, differing entirely from the star-shower that occupied the

  A* process of equal-weight reduction, recommended by Mr. Glaisher, for levelling

very abruptly varying observations, was three times applied to the meteoric rate-curve at
Moncalieri before all the extraordinary oscillations which it presents were so considerably
removed as to produce even the very irregular curve of frequency represented on the
accompanying figure.

other portions of the sky, and continuing to appear as long as the principal

shower was at its height until 5 minutes after 8 o'clock. The cloud then

gradually dispersed, and at 8 minutes after 8 o'clock it left the portion of the

sky which it had occupied as clear as it had been at first. So small and

i'requent were the meteors of this group that they could not be counted, and

they were omitted from the enumeration of those which passed across that

region of the sky."

   Although many meteors of great brilliancy were seen, Padre Denza esti-

mates the proportion of first-magnitude shooting-stars not to have exceeded

the fifth or sixth part of the whole number visible. Their courses were short,

Atheir speed moderate, and their colour white or bluish white.  faint aurora

was visible during a great part of the continuance of the shower.

These singular features of the display were not, however, recorded by the

majority of the observers ; but a faint aurora was observed at Palermo and

at other places in Italy, which, owing to commotions of the sun's photo-

sphere on that day, and not in the anticipation of any meteoric shower, Prof.

Tacchini telegraphed to some distant stations would probably be visible during

the night of the 27th. It was seen at Liverpool, and elsewhere in England ;

as well as a much brighter aurora at Bristol on the morning of the 24th.

   The shower was seen at Bombay, beginning at 8 o'clock p.m., and lasting

·with great brilliancy for eight hours ; at the Mauritius passing its maximum

between ll"" and half-past 11 o'clock vm. (where pulsations of the Aurora

Australis were also seen) ; and at Para in Brazil beginning at dusk and con-

tinuing until nearly midnight, besides at numerous places in Europe and

the United States of America where it was carefully observed. From the

nearly vertical descent of the meteors in Europe and America from a radiant-

point overhead, their apparent paths and durations were short, and a few

only of the brightest left very persistent streaks. It was remarked by Prof,
Newton that the bodies themselves were without doubt smaller, and would

therefore in any case be more quickly consumed than the usual August and
November meteors. None were observed at "Washington or Newhaven that

would have appeared notable in either the display of August 10th or of

November 14th. Among the 10,000 meteors counted at Glasgow Obser-

vatory by Professor Grant, only eight are described as having been as bright

as Sirius or Jupiter ; and about the same number were regarded by Mr. Lowe

as sufficiently conspicuous for description among about 14,000 meteors, which
he estimates to have been visible from his point of view. By Padre Denza

about twenty meteors are stated to have been as bright as Jupiter or Venus
among the 33,000 shooting-stars counted by his assistants. In a foggy and

lamp-lit atmosphere on the Capitol at Kome, Padre Secchi reckoned only a

fifth part as equal to second-magnitude stars, and a twentieth part as bright
as first-magnitude stars. Of the latter kind 188 were recorded, and only

thirty-three leaving phosphorescent streaks, among a total number of nearly

14,000 meteors seen there by his observers. One of these bright meteors was

a fine bolide, leaving a bright streak visible for about 3 minutes. Prof. Tacchini
states the numbers of various brightnesses seen at Palermo thus :

                         1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th and 6th magnitudes.

Numbers of meteors seen  10 1 40 53  698 (Total 802)

Of the ten first-magnitude meteors four were unconformable, and radiated

from a point below Orion, leaving very persistent streaks. Among about

8000 meteors seen at Athens, Dr. Schmidt could also not include a single
bolide having a sensible apparent disk. The average magnitude of the
                                                                                  ;

--393 REPORT 1873.

meteors at all the stations where they were carefully described is regarded as

not having much exceeded the fourth magnitude of the fixed stars. Orange,

red, and yellow, and more rarely green, were the predominating colours of

the brightest ; and when thus conspicuous an aureole of red and yeUow sparks

surrounded the nucleus in mid course, while a short white streak was left for

a few seconds, and very rarely for a few minutes, upon the track. The astro-

nomer at Bordeaux, M. Lespiault, however, records (' Comptes Rendus,' 1872,

Dec. 2nd) that " many of the meteors left bright streaks, some of which re-

mained visible 10"" or 15"", changing their shape and position in the sky

slightly before they disappeared." The great majority of the meteors were

mere points of dull white or yellowish light, without sparks or streak, moving

with very moderate speed in short courses of from 4° to 6° only, attaining

greater lengths of 10° or 15° and brighter white or bluish colour only in excep-

tional cases of the larger meteors of the shower ; their extinction was always

without explosion and quite gradual, but a few showed two maxima of
Abrightness or intermittent light.
                                    frequent peculiarity of the meteors was

a curved or wavy course. This was noticed by Dr. Schmidt at Athens, by
Prof. IS'ewton at Newhaven, and by Mr. E. L. Layard at Para in Brazil, who

writes, " Some I saw apparently disappear for a moment and come out again,

and two to my great surprise had a wavy course."

At the Mauritius, on the other hand, where the radiant was nearer the

horizon in the north, the meteors had long courses, and frequently left long

streaks upon their tracks. " The first meteor at 11" 22"" p.m. started from

the tail-stars of Aries, and vanished south of the echptic. The train of this

meteor was distinctly visible for 4 minutes, slowly wheeling from horizontal to

vertical, and remaining 2 minutes vertical to the horizon. The other meteor,

starting from a point at right angles to Aries and the Pleiades, passed through

the Pleiades, Taurus, and Orion, and vanished near Sirius. Its luminous

train was visible for more than a minute. Nearly all the meteors observed

radiated from a point near Aries, at right angles with the Pleiades, and shot

Aeither like the last or transverse to it.  streak as broad as the head in aU

cases, and in 80 or 90 per cent, of them 10" or 20° long, remained visible on

their tracks generally for a second or two. In the last two cases the broad

bright streak was at least 40° long." (Messrs. Bruce and Hon. E. Newton.)

" Erom 10" 15"' to 10" 30", the Hyades, Pleiades, and Orion being about

40° or 50° above the north horizon, the meteors appeared flying from north

to south, and from N.E. to S.E. or from N.W. to S.W. on each side of north.
Their rate of appearance was about one per second, two or three sometimes
appearing together. The nearer ones every few minutes showed trains and

sparks like a rocket, varying from 2° or 3° to 5° or 6° in length, and seldom

reaching 10°. Towards 11 o'clock fewer seemed to be faUing than before."

(Messrs. A. C. M'Pherson and Hon. Robert Stein.)
   In lat. 19° 52' S., long. 50° 25' E., Captain Gaston of S. ' Penelope,' " saw

an extraordinary star-shower beginning at about 7" 30"". The meteors shot

from north towards south-east. Some of them were bright, others leaving

only a slender streak, and this display lasted until 2" a.m." The radiant in

the Mauritius must have been near o ^ Persei, and the time of maximum of

the shower at or soon after 11" p.m. (Mr. C. Meldrum's report on the shower

in ' Nature ' of January 23rd, 1873.)
   The radiation of this star-shower was very scattered, and the positions

assigned to it by various observers often differed very considerably from each

other. Thus the last-mentioned position assigned to it by Mr. Meldrum

+from the observations at the Mauritius, is at about R. A. 54°, Decl. 31°
OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.  393

while an observer near Dublin, Mr. M. H. Close, describes. its position as near

+I Anclroracdae at R. A. 19°, Decl. 45° ; and independently of their geo-

graphical position, such differences are found among the notes of many ob-

servers of the shower. The great majority of the best determinations of its

place are, on the other hand, very near the latter place. The accompanying

diagram shows the recorded positions, from ninety independent determina-

                                                                         E.A. in degrees.

tions of its place, which are described as definite points among the accounts
given by different observers of their observations of the shower. The prin-

cipal region comprises a compact group of about thirty-five observations,
having their centre or average place at R. A. 25°"1, Decl. -|-42°-9. There are

besides many observations of radiant-points on the northern and eastern side of

this group (twenty-two observations) in the same ten-degree square of E. A.

+and Decl. with it, of which the centre is at R. A. 25°- 9, Decl. 46°- 7,

forming an apparent diffuseness of the principal radiant region in that
direction. Lastly, the average position of all the outlying radiant-points
(thirty-three observations) is at E. A. 23°-0, Decl. -(-45°-3, and the average
position of all the ninety observations projected in this map, at E. A. 24°*54,
Decl.-|-44°-74, can scarcely be more than half a degree from the general di-
rection of these numerously recorded centres of divergence of the shower.
The position fixed by Mr. Hind's computation of the radiant-point of par-
ticles of Biela's comet had the shower been visible at the comet's last return
in 1866 is at E.A. 25°-25, Decl. +42°, not quite 3° southward from the

general radiant place, and 1° south of the mean principal or central radiant-
point of the shower as found by these observations of its recent great appear-

ance in Ifovember 1872.

 --Star-sliowers of December 12<7i, 1872, and January 2nd, 1873. From the

effect of bright moonlight and of a cloudy sky, no observations of the
December meteors in 1872 could be obtained. The sky was equally overcast
on the night of January 1st, 1873 ; but accounts in the newspapers (' Daily
Telegraph ') of the 3rd mentioned the occarrence of several bright meteors on

the morning of the 2nd of January between l"" and 2*" a.m. at Wrexham. On

the night of December 31st, Mr. Denning traced the paths of twelve meteors

in 3 hours on a map, without perceiving a distinct radiant-point, the principal
centres of divergence being apparently near 3 Leonis, a Geminorum, and in
Ursa Major. The sky was clear, and the light of an aurora rather bright in

the north.

On the night of January 2nd the sky was clear between storm-clouds at

Bristol, and Mr. Denning saw an intense flash of lightning (which was per-

haps meteoric) from the south, at Bristol. But shooting-stars at this place

and at other stations where the sky was clear were exceedingly scarce until

midnight, not more than two or three small ones appearing in an hour. The

largest number counted was six meteors per hour, by Mr. Wood at Birming-

ham, of which only one diverged from the usual radiant-point of the January

shower. The appearance of the star-shower at Wrexham on the morning of

January 2nd was, however, fully confirmed by Mr. Backhouse at Sunderland,

who in a watch kept between o*" and 7*" a.m. on that morning, recorded the

paths of 31 meteors, the rate of their appearance being 37 per hour for one

observer. The radiant-point, or rather the centre of a radiant area, which

seemed to be 7° or 8° in diameter, was at E.. A. 234°, N. Decl. 48°, within

3° of the position near c Quadrantis, where it was observed by Professor

Herschel on the 2nd of January, 1864 (' Report ' for 1 864, p. 98), and

agreeing well with the bright character of the display, and with the great

scarcity of meteors on each of the adjacent nights, in marking the shower as

a very well-defined reappearance of the January meteors of that periodic date.

On the nights of the 25th and 27th of February, 1873, bright meteors

were seen by Mr. H. W. Jackson at Tooting, who drew attention to their

appearance as perhaps indicating special star- shower dates. On the latter

night several bright meteors were also noted by Mr. Denning at Bristol while

observing Jupiter throiigh a telescope, without paying particular attention to

Arecord their numbers and directions.  bright flash like lightning appeared

behind a cloud in the south at 10" 30", the rest of the sky being clear ; and

a bright shooting-star observed at 7'' 30" was recorded simultaneously by

Mr. Denning and by Mr. Jackson at Tooting (see the foregoing Hst of double

observations).

only, but on the 21st it was generally overcast. In London, and at Bristol,
Street (near Bath), York, Sunderland, and Newcastle-upon-Tyne, observa-
tions of some hours' duration on each night were made ; and a list of shooting-
stars was also recorded on the night of the 21st by Mr. Denning at Bristol.
The number of meteors from Lyra did not exceed that of the unconformable
meteors (amounting together to about eight per hour) on either of these
periodic nights ; but the proportion observable on the 19th was slightly higher

than on the other nights. A long-continued watch was kept by Mr. Lucas at

the Radcliffe Observatory at Oxford from 10 o'clock p.m. until half-past two,
and half-past one o'clock a.m. on the nights of the 19th and 20th of April
respectively, with similar results. The centre of the April meteor-stream

appears from these observations to have been crossed by the earth during the
daytime of April 20th, when daylight intervening between two slender indica-
tions of the shower must have caused the period of its greatest intensity to pass
unobserved. Four double observations of shooting-stars occurred among the

lists recorded on the first two nights, descriptions of which are contained in

--the foregoing catalogue of such identifiable accordances.
   The Aur/ust Meteors in 1873. The observations of this annual shower
were much incommoded by clouds, and the brightness of the full moonlight
concealed a large proportion of the meteors of the shower, which would

otherwise have been visible. On the night of the 10th the sky was every-
where completely overcast, and on that of the 11th so much so that a conti-

nuous record of the numbers seen could not be obtained at any of the ob-
servers' stations. The following are the numbers seen at Bristol by two
observers, looking towards the N.E. and N.W. quarters of the sky, during
successive quarters of an hour, ending on the night of the 9th of August at

   On the night of the 11th Mr. Denning found them to be more frequent

than on the 9th, and the appearance of their display was that of an August
star-shower of somewhat considerable brightness. At the other stations it was

not found possible to count the meteors, as at Bristol, so as to trace the pro-
gress and apparent brightness of the shower on account of the frequent in-
terruptions from the general prevalence of cloudy skies ; but a continuous
watch kept at the Eadcliffe Observatory, Oxford, by Mr. Lucas, for about
four hours on the night of the 9th, and for an hour and a half on that of the
11th, corroborates Mr. Denning's observations. About 50 meteors were

mapped at all the stations in a total watch of about 7 hours on the 9th, and
about 30 meteor-paths in a total watch of about 3| hours on the 11th. Those
meteors of the collected list which were simultaneously observed at two or
more stations in the watch are described in the above catalogue of double
observations. The position of the radiant-point and other particulars of the
appearance of the shower will be examined for comparison with the observa-
tions of the previous year, when the necessary projections of the meteor-

tracks can be completed.

396 REPORT--1873.

  --Meteors of September Ist, 1873. Quite an abundance of bright meteors

(as communicated by Mr. J. E. Clark) was seen at Street, Somersetshire, on
the night of the 1st of September, 1873. Nine meteors, some of them very-
fine ones, were seen between 11'' and 12'' p.m., mostly in the south; but the
directions of their apparent paths were not noted with sufficient accuracy to
determine the place of their radiant-point, or if aU the meteors of the display
diverged very definitely from a common centre.

                       IV. Papers relating to Meteoric Astronomy.

   The discussions relating to the second great star-shower in November, now
known to be connected with Biela's comet, occupy the principal place of in-
terest among the various published papers on meteoric astronomy during the

past year. In the Reports of this Committee for the years 1868 (p. 399) and
1869 (p. 305), the communications of Professors d' Arrest and Galle on the con-
nexion of certain comets with meteor-showers are briefly abstracted from two
Numbers (1633 and 1635) of the 'Astronomische Nachrichten ' of the month of
March, 1867 (the same apparent connexions having already been announced
by Dr. Weiss, of Vienna, in the next preceding No. 1632 of the same Journal),
with some errors and omissions which require correction. The star-shower
indicated by d'Arrest dififers entirely from the principal December star-shower
of December llth-13th, there supposed to be signified, whose radiant-point
is between the constellations Gemini and Auriga. That indicated by Prof,
d'Arrest is a star- shower, having a more north-westerly radiant-point in
Andromeda, appearing in the British Association list of 1868 as A^^ (Nov. 23-
Dec. 18), connected perhaps with A^^^ j^ of an earUer date, and in Dr.
Heis's list of the year 1867 * as A,g and Xj, in the latter half of November and
beginning of December, whose positions are all in or near the constellation
Cassiopeia. It is pointed out by Prof, d'Arrest that meteoric showers having
this direction occurred on the following dates :

          .D. 1741.
OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.  397

auroral light along the north horizon, extending from N.W. to N.E., apparently
equally extended on each side of the true meridian. The meteors were not
watched after 7^; but about 11'', on looking out again, I saw one, the only
one in several minutes in the S.W. ; but it had now no longer a vertical di-
rection, its course pointing now to the N.W." The endeavours of the Com-
mittee to consult an account of the same phenomenon by Mr. Maverly at
Gosport, if it was published as stated by Mr. Webb, have not hitherto been

attended with the success that will, perhaps, await the further continuation

of their search.

   An error of omission is also contained in the above-mentioned abstracts of

the Papers of d'Arrest and Galle ; as it is not observed that the latter as well

as the former astronomer pointed out the probable connexion of such meteoric

showers with Biela's comet. At the close of his note on the cometary cha-

--racter of the April star-shower, Dr. Galle adds : " Amongst other comets

yielding meteor-showers, if some overtake the earth they would appear more
deflected from their real orbits than meteor-streams arriving from the oppo-
site direction. As an example of this kind, I calculated the radiant-point of
the comet of Biela at its descending node, since the date of this (Nov. 28th) is
found to occur in a period of considerable frequency of meteors ; but I have
not found in all the observations to which I could refer that the date of
Nov. 28th is especially distinguished from other days near it ; and it appears
to be connected with the weeks immediately preceding and following it in
the prevalence of meteoric displays. The comet's direct motion makes the
date of its nodal passage less fixed and less certain, and the agreement with

observations accordingly less likely to be so perfect in the case of this comet
as in other cases. Yet renewed observations on. the night of the 27th of
November certainly deserve to be very carefully repeated." (Breslau, March
11th, 1867; 'AstronomischeNachrichten,' No. 1635.) D'Arrest's communi-
cation in the 'Astr. Nachr.' No. 1633, is dated Copenhagen, Feb. 25th, 1867.
The calculations showing the probable connexion of two comets (1861, I., and
Biela's comet) with the April and November to December star-showers by
Dr. Weiss, are contained in an earlier No. (1632) of the ' Astronomische Nach-
richten.' The latter memoir was extended and completed by Dr. Weiss in the
'Astronomische Nachrichten,' No. 1710, and in the valuable paper presented

to the Academy of Sciences at Vienna on the 16th of January, 1868, ' Beitrage

zur Kentniss der Sternschnuppen ' (see these Reports for 1869, p. 304).

   A short review of the above predictions was presented to the Royal Astro-

nomical Society (' Monthly Notices,' vol. xxxii. p. 355) during the summer

of last year in preparation for the expected approach of Biela's comet to the
neighbourhood of the earth's orbit in the latter months of the year ; and the
attention of astronomers appears to have been already drawn to the favour-
able prospect of a meteoric shower from the above-cited papers sufficiently

to make its character at once decided by the majority of the observers when
the abundant star-shower was observed. Prof. Klinkerfues at Gcittingen,
whose observations of the shower were most complete, immediately dispatched
an instruction by telegraph to Mr. N. Pogson, the astronomer at Madras, to

search the portions of the sky opposite to the radiant-point for any cometary
body which might be visible in the direction of the departing and retreating
meteor-group through which the earth had passed. Such a comet was found
by Mr. Pogson on the 2ud of December, about 13° from the place of the anti-
radiant-point, and close to the position pointed out by Di-. Klinkerfues.
Another observation of it was obtained on Dec. 3rd, and there is sufficient
resemblance in the observed track of the comet to that which meteors con-

nected witli Biela's comet might pursue to make it probable that this tele-
scopic body is at least a member of the cometary group, of which it is not
impossible that the double comet of Biela may contain other representatives
 hitherto not detected by telescopic observations*. Should the principal bodies of
Biela's comet have undergone no uncalculable perturbations, it is shown by
Mr. Hind (' Monthly Notices,' vol. xxxiii. p. 320) that up to its expected return
 in the year 1866, no calculable causes depending upon its actual position until
that time have been overlooked, and that if uninvestigated disturbances may
yet explain its presence in the recent meteor-shower at a place of its orbit which

·it should have passed at least twelve weeks before the date of the meteor-
 shower, those disturbances must have affected its course during the last re-
volution (1866-73) which the comet has performed. It appears more pro-
bable that the comet has faded out of sight ; and it is pointed out by Professor

Schiaparelli, in a new volume of three lectures on meteors pubUshed in con-

nexion with these recent discoveries at Florence, that more than one instance
of variability has been observed in comets, of which the two portions of

Biela's comet itself presented a remarkable example at the last return, when
interchanges of brightness were observed between them. It may also be
added that when first discovered to be periodical in the year 1826, it was
found to be identical with a comet observed in the years 1772 and 1805,

having accordingly escaped observation during two previous series of returns

in this and the last century, when it might be expected to have been detected^
had not some diminution of its light, perhaps, rendered it invisible on each of
those occasions. Telescopic and meteoric observations may thus be found, if

perseveringly conducted and comprehensively carried on together, to assist
 each other in tracing the effects of the sudden variations in their physical
condition to which comets, from their small masses and highly eccentric
 orbits, are exposed, more than all other classes of astronomical bodies, in

 their circumsolar revolutions.

    The newly discovered connexion between meteor-showers and comets,
according to which the periodic comet of Biela and the recently observed
star-shower are associated members of a common stream of bodies following
each other in nearly the same path about the sun ; and the question of the pro-
bable nature of the physical connexion between the invisible particles of the
meteor-stream, and the faintly or brightly luminous body of its attendant
 comet, have given rise to considerable discussion respecting the extent and
mode of the connexion in which comets in general, and all the different

forms of meteoric substances may possibly be regarded as allied phenomena.

"With respect to appearances of the latter class, it must be admitted that

many of the grounds for such conclusions regarding detonating fireballs and
aerolites are hitherto verj^ indefinite and uncertain. The directions and real

velocities in space of very few aerolites and detonating meteors have been
 exactly ascertained ; while, on the other hand, the collected proofs derived
from observations of a distinct connexion between star-showers and periodic
 comets are as abundant and precise as the most rigorous process of research
in any kindi-ed subject of scientific inquiry would demand. Eeviewing
 certain instances of hyperbolic velocities of fireballs and aeroli tes that have
been sufficiently well observed to be accepted as examples of their class, and
 contrasting the evidence which they present with the remarkable absence
among comets of very excentric hy]Derbolic orbits. Prof. Schiaparelli is led to
recognize two different original sources of these two classes of bodies, and to
regard comets as cosmical bodies belonging to the same star family, or " star-

OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.  399

drift " as the sun, and some aerolites and fireballs as derived from more
distant regions of the fixed stars, the direction and speed of whose motions in
space (as gathered from the recent researches of Dr. Huggins and Mr. Proctor)
resemble each other, but differ considerably fronl those of the sun. As
examples of hj^Dcrbolic velocities among firebalLs and aerolites are of rather

rare occurrence, it is, however, admissible to regard these instances as
exceptional cases, and not as the normal representatives of their class*. In

that case aerolites, as well as shower-meteors, may be parts of cometarj

systems ; and it is not impossible that the extraordinary meteorological

changes which comets undergo from the excentricities of their orbits, may,

by the process of a kind of ' weathering,' disintegrate their surfaces suffi-

ciently to scatter such bodies in crowds along their pathsf. In this view,

instead of presupposing the existence of cosmical clouds containing all these

several bodies separately formed, comets may be regarded as parent bodies,

from which aerolites and shower-meteors are similarly derived. Adopting a

special theory of the origin and of the physical constitution of comets,

Zcilluer explains the production of such star-showers as that which was wit-

nessed last November, by a process very similar to the lastj:. Supposing the
remnants of a shattered star or planet to be scattered by some catastrophe

into intrastellar space, besides the materials of aerolites and detonating fire-

balls which would result, it may be assumed that fluid masses, as of their

seas (and possiblj^ hydrocarbons) and other easily volatilizable substances

would occur among the debris of such a shock. Among the fluids and easily

vaporizable materials thus ushered into space, and there maintained as

liquids or solids by cold, and by their own attractions, the sun's heat acting
upon their otherwise fixed masses, when first drawn into its immediate

neighbourhood, would effect a surface distillation sufficiently abundant to
detach some vaporous portions from their spheres, or even to volatilize them

completely, and to efface them after many periodic revolutions fi-om the sky.

These vapours might possibly recondense afterwards into solid dust or drops,
to assume the form of meteor-streams along the cometary orbit, producing

on their collision with the earth's atmosphere, the extraordinary phenomena

of star-showers§. In accepting such explanations of their origin, it must be
borne in mind that the streams of meteor-particles with which some periodic

comets are associated are altogether differently constituted from the tails and
envelopes of such comets, in obeying, as far as has yet been discovered,

without any deviations like the extraordinary exceptions which those appen-
dages present, the simple law of imiversal gravitation M'hich governs the

    § Tbat even mineral substances are gradually volatilized at comparatively low tempera-
tures, and sublime or are recondensed in appreciable quantities, is sbown by some remark-

able experiments by the Eev. W. Vernon Harcourt on various minerals placed for many

years imder the hearth of an iron smelting-furnace, as described in the volume of these
Eeports for 1860, p. 175 ef. acq. (with coloured plates). Under the action of a prolonged
heat, in which neither copper, zinc, lead, nor tin were melted, the oxide of copper which
formed a crust upon the plate of that metal, had sublimed, and deposited itself in red
crystals along with sublimed metallic copper, not only upon the surface, but also in the
interior of the neighbouring piece of lead. The adjacent pieces of the other metiils were
similarly calcined, and coated with a thick crystalline crust of their o.xides which bad
diffused itself in a similar manner among the substances of the surrounding blocks (see
the explanation of the experiments and of the plates, at pp. 188 and 192 of that Report).

motions of tlie planets and of the comets in their paths. It is also important

to observe that among the spectra of several telescopic comets which have

been examined, there is a typical resemblance which leads us to infer that the

coma or envelope of such comets is at least in great measure composed of

Ao ases shining, for some reason, with self-resplendent light.  state of

liquid or solid aggregation of vaporizable materials by extreme cold cannot

on this account be regarded as a complete explanation of the original con-

dition of their nuclei, unless, with Zollner, we admit that a feeble electrical

excitation accompanies the development of the vapours from them that pro-

duce the envelope and tail ; and that a restoration of the disturbed electrical

equilibrium among these vapours produces in them (as in the extensive tracts

of auroral clouds) a sufficiently strong illumination to be visible on account

of their great depth ; as even bright auroral beams may be produced by weak

electrical discharges lighting up vast volumes of air through which they pass.

The free electricity with which the vapours are charged would be suffi-

cient, as shown by Dr. Zollner, to account for the rapid projection of the

extremely rarefied materials of the tail in an outward direction from the

sun, if its tension, and that of free electricity similarly present in the sun

itself, is supposed not to exceed the amount assigned by Hankel as the ordi-

nary tension of free electricity in the earth's atmosphere. On account of

their larger masses (compared to the surfaces, upon which electricity resides)

no sensible effect of repulsion is produced by solar electricity on the nucleus,

and on the larger fragments separated from the comet's mass, that appre-

ciably diminishes the force of universal gravitation upon them, to which, in

common with all other bodies coming within the sphere of the sun's attrac-

tion, the separate particles of the cometary cloud are principally subject.

Similar -views to those of Dr. ZoUner on the electrical origin of the sun's

repulsive force on the tails and envelopes of comets (a force whose intensity

was first mathematically investigated by Bessel) were previously entertained

by Olbers, and discussions of some of their principal consequences, with

excellent illustrations derived from cometary observations by M. Faye, will

be found in the ' Comptes Rendus ' (vol. xlviii. p. 421) for 1870, and in a con-
temporary number of the French ' Eevue des Courses Scientifiques.' The

theory of a self-luminosity in comets, and perhaps in the vaporous nebulae,
resembling the glow-discharge in the vacuum of a barometer-tube when the

mercury is shaken, suggests, as shown by Dr. ZoUuer, no insuperable diffi-

culties, when the enormous thickness of the vapour-tracts is considered, in

which a very feeble illumination of this description would be sufficient to

render them very discernibly self-luminous, with all the visible characters

of a glowing gas.

Dui'ing the last two or three years the discovery of energetic forces of

eruption on the sun, and therefore also probably on the surfaces of the stars,
has demonstrated the occasional occurrence of some convulsions so extremely
violent that they would suffice (at least, if they were but Httle stronger, or
equally energetic at an earlier period of the sun's history, when its diameter
was somewhat larger) to project molten and gaseous matters from its mass

to distances beyond the sphere of its own attraction. One of the most violent
eruptions of this description was observed by Prof. Young in America on the
7th of September, 1871, when masses of glowing hydrogen left the sun's
surface with a velocity of projection which cannot have been less than 200

miles per second ; had it started with this velocity from an elevation but
little more than twice its actual distance from the sun's centre, it would have

been projected beyond the orbit of the planet Neptune, and a velocity of

projection from the sun's present surface of 380 miles per second would have
sufficed to carry it beyond the limits of the solar system never to return*.
The existence of such forces, and the evidence wliich the microscope affords
that aerolites have had their origin among mineral masses in a state of
fusion, if not of vapour, combine to support a theory formerly entertained by
other writers, and recently announced most definitely by Mr. Proctor in
England f and Prof. Eirkwood in America as an " astro-meteorological

hypothesis " of the origin of meteors and meteorites. By a still more

remarkable supposition Mr. Proctor proposes to regard the class of periodic
comets with their attendant trains of meteors as originally projected from
the major planets^Jupiter, Uranus, or Is^eptnne, in the neighbourhood of whose

orbits it is well known that the greater number of their aphelia are placed
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

and some peculiarities of the light as well as of the dense atmosphere of the

largest of these planets, Jupiter, renders it probable that it is partially self-

luminous, and that it still continues to be in a more sunlike state than the

Asmaller primary and secondary planets of the solar systemj. close appulso

of the November meteor-comet to the earth is pointed out by Mr. Hind as
having probably occurred in the year 1366, when it was observed in China in
the same month of October with the memorable star-shower recorded in some
parts of Europe in that year. Another visible return of the comet appears
to have taken place in 868, when its path among the constellations was also
recorded in China, and appears to be in good agreement with the orbit of the
present coraet§. It also appears that the November meteor-shower may be
of older date than the period assigned by M. Le Verrier (a.d. 126) to its last

encounter with the planet Uranus, a previous encounter with that planet not
less close having been shown by Prof. Kirkwood (in the journal above quoted,
p. 338) to have taken place in the year b.c. 43, Avhile the next close appulse
of the comet to the planet Avill ha^jpen in the year 1983.

   A general list of approximate agreements between orbits of comets and

those of observed meteor-showers, extracted from the works of Weiss, S(5hia-
parelli, and Schmidt, will be found collected, exclusive of the four well-known
examples of perfect correspondence in the cases of the April, August, and two
great November showers, in the Heport of the Council to the last Annual
General Meeting of the E,oyal Astronomical Society, where the length of the
list, and a due regard for the limited space of this Report, will only permit
its insertion to be noticed l|; but a peculiarity in two of the accordances

appears to claim exception in order to explain the supposed agreements which
they present. In the early parts of April and August two meteor- showers
are found to proceed, the former from a radiant-point between Corona and
Bootes, and the latter from near the north pole of the heavens, agreeing well
with the radiant-points of corresponding comets whose line of nodes the
earth encounters at those dates. But the orbits of these comets falling far

within the orbit of the earth, it is not possible th;it an encounter of tlie earth
with any meteors Ijnng upon their tracks could be produced. These accord-
ances must therefoi'c be rejected, unless, with Weiss and Schiaparelli, it is

supposed possible tliat some parts of the cometary substance, repelled from

their proper orbits by the sun in the form of the tail and other luminous

appendages emitted by the comets near their perihelion passages, may have

extended to such a distance iu their orbit-planes as to intersect the orbit of

the earth. It is knov,Ti that substance repelled in this manner from the

comet, if it consists of materials capable of finally gravitating towards the

sun, -win describe closed orbits round it, and might thus periodically produce

the appearance of a corresponding meteor-shower. For the purpose of an

approximate comparison with the known meteor-showers, the repelled par-
ticles may be assumed to move in orbits which differ little from those of

their derivative comets, excepting iu having a larger perihelion distance.
    In order to complete and facilitate, as far as possible, the comparison of

meteor-streams with the orbits of known comets, lists of observed radiant-

points of meteor-showers continue to be compiled and recorded by observers,
an important contribution for that purpose dui'ing the jiast year being the

" Catalogue of Observed Eadiant-points " obtained by Captain G. L. Tupmau
from his observations of shooting-stars made in the Mediterranean during the

years 1869-71*. This list contains the places of 102 distinct radiant-points,

independently determined, and for the most part confirming the results

presented in the earlier catalogues of other observers. Thus, iu about sixty
cases, the same showers appear to have been recorded by Dr. Schmidt f at
Athens ; and the agreements with the general list of radiant-points for the

northern hemisphere, exclusive of Dr. Schmidt's results (sec the last Report),

compiled by Mr. Greg are equally numerous. Cajjtain Tupman regards

fifty-eight of the meteor-showers described iu his list as identical, and
twenty-one others as fairly in accordance with those of other observers ; of the

remaining twenty-three positions, nearly the whole may be regarded as well
determined and as probably true radiant-points. Among the brightest

showers and the most conspicuous radiant-points were remarkable displays
of about fifteen or twenty shooting-stars per hour on the nights of April 30th

and May 2nd, 1870, from the direction of a point at R. A. 325°, S. Decl. 3°;

and showers of less abundance on March 7th, September 8-10 and 13-15, and
October 5-10, 1869, and November 1-9, 1869 and 1872 : the last was the
well-known shower from Taurus in the eaj'ly part of November ; and a good

average position of its apparently double radiant-point in about R. A. 53°,

N. Decl. 12°, and R. A. 57°, N. Decl. 20°, was obtained by several wcU-

agreeing observations on successive nights.

Dr. Ileis in April 1867 (' Astronomische Nachrichten,' No. 1642), was

                   On the Visibility of the dark side of Venus.
                  By Professor A, Schaparik^ of Prague.

       [A Communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso.']

Ix is well known that the uuillumined side of the planet Yenus has been
sometimes seen shining with a faint grey light, like the dark side of the moon
when illumined by the earth,

   Schrciter in 1806 thought he had made for the first time this remark-

able observation ; but it was found afterwards that Harding had made it
almost simultaneously, and Olbers pointed out an old observation made by
A. Mayer at Gryphiswald in 1759. Arago found a still older observation of
the same kind made by Derham at a date not fixed, but certainly anterior to

1729, the date of publication of the Ereuch edition of his 'Astrotheology.'
 - [Nevertheless this phenomenon is stated in the best text-books of astronomy

to be one of the utmost rarity. Madler knows only two observers of it, the
profoundly learned Humboldt only three, Arago only five ; and even re-
cently Dr. Winnecke, of Karlsruhe, believed that he was the only witness of
that phenomenon in daylight since the time of A. Mayer ; but under these

particular circumstances it has been seen by eleven observers, and by five
of them more than once.

   It was known to me for a long time that there were on record far more

observations of this phenomenon than is ordinarily svipposed ; and when,
some years ago, I happened to be a witness of it myself, I undertook to

collect all existing observations of it.

   This I have now done ; and as I have succeeded in collecting the sur-
prising number of twenty-two observations, many of them repeated more

than once, a short account of what I have found will perhaps be not unin-

teresting to astronomers.

    1. The first observation recorded is that of William Derham, Canon of
"Windsor, referred to in his 'Astrotheology ' as made in the perigeum of Venus,
probably in bright twilight, when he saw the dark side of the planet shining
with a dim reddish light. Arago, who mentions this observation, quotes
from a French translation published in 1729. It would be interesting to
know if this observation is found also in the first English edition published

in 1714.

   2. The second in order was Christian Kirch, first astronomer of the Eoyal

Academy of Sciences at Eerlin. He saw the phenomenon twice (June 7, 1721

and March 8, 1726), both times with moderate optical power and in bright

twilight. He remarked that the bright crescent was apparently a part of a

larger sphere than the faintly shining dark side. (Astrouomische Nachrichten,
No. 1586, vol.lxvii. p. 27.)

    3. Third came Andreas Mayer, Professor of Mathematics in the Gryphis-
wald University, who, on October 20, 1759, obsen-ed Venus, culminating
only 10° from the sun, with an unacliromatic transit-instrument of only
l|-inch aperture, and saw the whole disk "like the crescent moon which re-

flects the light of the earth." (Observationes Veneris Gryphiswaldenses, 1762,

p. 19. Schrciter, Beobachtungen des grossen Cometen von 1807, Appendix,

p. 74.)

   4. The fourth witness is Sir William Herschel, who about 1790 several

times saw a part of the limb of the daik side in a faint light. Neither date
nor time of day is given. (On the planet Venus, Philosop^hical Transactions

for 1793.)

     5. Count rriedrich Hahn, of Eemplin, Mecklenburg, saw the phenomenon
 unusuall}- Avell and often during the spring and summer of 1793, in twilight

 as well as in daylight. He employed excellent instruments, and gives a
 very detailed description of what ho saw ; also two sketches. No other ob-

 server seems to have seen the phenomenon so often and so well. (Berliner
 astronomisches Jahrbuch fiir 17913, p. 188.)

     6. The venerable old selenographer Schroter saw the phenomenon only
 once, February 14, ISOG, in faint twilight, with an excellent telescope, and
 gives a very accurate description and sketch of it. lie remarked an im-
 portant feature in the phenomenon : the limb of the dark hemisphere was
 brighter than its central part. (Berliner astronomisches Jahrbxich fiir 1809,
p. 164, and Beobachtungen des grossen Cometen von 1807, Appendix,

p. 66.)

     7. Simultaneously with Schroter, and independently of him, C. L. Hard-
ing, at Gottingen, succeeded in observing the dark side of Venus on throe

--different evenings January 24, February 28, and March 1, 1806. On the

second of these days the light was reddish grey, and on all of them the
phenomenon was seen with the iitmost sharpness and distinctness. (Berliner
Jahrbuch fiir 1809, p. 169.)

   8. The well-known observer of the sun J, W. Pastorff, at Buchholz in
Prussia, saw the phenomenon (as he reports) many times so distinctly that

he could distinguish bright and dark patches in the faint grey light. Only
one date and a corresponding drawing are given, February 10, 1822, at 5
P.M., when the breadth of the crescent was 0'23 diameter of the whole disk.
(Berliner Jahrbuch fiir 182.5, p. 235.)

    9. June 8, 1825, at 4 a.m., almost in full daylight, the phenomenon was
witnessed by Gruithuisen at Munich. No particulars given. (Astronomisches
Jahrbuch fiir 1842, herausgegeben von Gruithuisen, p. 158.)

    10. The next observation was made by Mr. Guthrie, near Bervie, N.B.
(Great Britain), during the inferior conjunction in December 1842. Mr.
Guthrie saw a narrow fringe of light around the whole disk of the planet.
(Monthly Notices of the Eoy. Astr. Soc., vol. xiv. p. 169.)

    11. G. A. Jahn, at Leipzic, saw the dark side of Yenus on September 27
and 28, 1855, at 11 a.m., in broad daylight. (Jahn's Unterhaltnngen im

Gebiete der Astronomic, vol. ix. p. 320.)

    12. Mr. Berry, of Liverpool, saw the phenomenon on the evening of
January 14, 1862. (Month. Not. vol. xxii. p. 158.)

    13. Mr. C. L. Prince, of Uckfield, observed Venus almost daily during her
inferior conjunction between Sept. 23rd and 30th, 1863, in bright daylight,
and coitld trace on every day the whole disk, or at least a faint fringe of
light around the edge. (Month. Not. vol. xxiv. p. 25.)

  --14. Mr. "VV. Engelmann, of the Leipzic Observatory, saw the phenomenon

repcatcdlj- most advantageously, as it seems, on April 20, 1865, immediately
after sunset. The dark side was greenish grey, a little brighter than the sky.

(Astron. Nachr. No. 1526, vol. Ixiv. p. 223.)

   15. During the inferior conjunction of 1867 Venus was well observed by
Professor C. S. Lyman, of Yale College, Newhaven, U. S. The extension of
the crescent over more than 180° was seen during a period of eleven days
on 10th and 12th of December the thin bri^ght crescent formed an unbroken
ring; on the day of conjunction (11th December) the close proximity of the
sun permitted no observation. (American Journal of Science, 2nd series,

vol. xliii. p. 129.)

   16. Mr. Th. Petty, of Deddington, near Oxford, saw the dark side of Venus
                --

--406 EEPORT 1873.

ou May 23 and June 9, 1868, probably during twilight, (Astronomical Ee-

gister, No. 68, p. 181.)
   17. In the same year I was observing Venus attentively for some months,

chiefly in broad daylight, with a small but good achromatic. I saw spots on
different occasions ; and on July 4, 1868, at 1 p.m., I could see traces of the dark
disk, though unsteadiness of the air and insufficient optical power prevented
ine from becoming certain of what I saw.

   18. On February 5, 1870, the dark side of the planet, then near inferior

conjunction, was seen (in daylight, I suppose) by Mr. R. Langdon, of Sil-
verton, Devonshire. (Month. Not. vol. xxxii. p. 307; Astron. Reg. No. 115,
p. 163, where the year is erroneously stated to be 1872.)

   19. Captain W. Noble, of Leyton, Essex, saw the dark part of Venus very

distinctly on February 22, 1870, only twenty-four hours before conjunction,
in close proximity to the sun. In a later commitnication, Captain Noble adds
that he saw the dark side always darker than the surrounding sky, and that
he rarely failed to see it whenever Venus was in or near inferior conjunction.
(Month. Not. vol. xxx. p. 1-52 ; Astron. Reg. No. 88, p. 74, and No. 130, p. 2.58.)

    20. At the meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society, March 11, 1870,
Mr. Browning stated that, without any special contrivance, he could see all

--the globe of the planet in his 12-inch speculum perhaps on twenty different

evenings, as Mr. Browning told me orally, and always in bright twUight.
 The unillumined side appeared darker than the sky around it. (Ast. Reg.

 No. 88, p. 74, and No. 131, p. 281.)

    21. On August 9, 1870, I was regarding Venus in bright sunshine at
11 A.M., when a lady who was with mo at that time immediately perceived

 the whole disk of the planet. I showed to her Schriitcr'a drawing, which
 she declared to be in perfect accordance with what she saw in the telescope.
 I fancied only at moments that I saw a faint lino of light all round tho

 greyish disk. Illumination unusually large (0-35) ; air much disturbed at

 the time.

    22. Dr. A. "Winnecke, of Karlsruhe, saw the phenomenon twice, on Sep-
 tember 25, 1871, at noon, and November 6, 1871, at 5 a.m. (Astron. Nachr,

 No. 1863, and No. 1866, vol. Ixxviii. pp. 236 & 287.)
    On the day subsequent to Dr. Winnecke's first observation, September 26,

 Captain Noble could not make out the dark hemisphere so well seen by
 him a year before that time, but he adds that the sky was not clear. (Month.

 Not. vol. xxxii. p. 17.)

    From the above conspectus it appears that the unillumined side of Venus

--has been seen by 22 different observers :

              In twUight by 13 (once by 4, many times by 9),
              In daylight by 11 (once by 6, many times by 5).

 4 observers saw a faint line of light encircling the dark disk, 19 of them saw
 the disk itself. Of the 22 cases reported, 12 have been observed during the

 last eleven years, say one per year ; and I am disposed to think that tho

 phenomenon is a normal one, and that with sufficient optical power and
  attention under a favourable sky it is to be seen at every inferior conjunc-
 tion, though I would by no means advance that it is constantly visible,
 which would be a statement directly opposed to facts.

      For the explanation of this remarkable j)henomenon the following causes
 have been suggested :

  --1. Plwspliorescence. This was the idea of Sir William Herschel, Harding,

  and partly of Schroter. It docs not aj^pear clearly whether they under-
. ON THE VISIBILITY OF THE DARK SIDE OF VENUS.  407

stood the word in its modera sense, meaning substances which absorb
sunlight and emit it in darkness without being chemically changed, or
whether they included under that name, like all the elder physicists, slow
combustions also, like that of phosjihorus and rotten Avood, which in modern
terminology do not belong to true phosphorescence. In both cases it is
difficult to imagine the whole surface of the planet to be covered with

such substances as sulphide of strontium, diamond, phosphorus, or rotten
wood.

 --2. Auroral phenomena. This was partly Schriiter's idea; it is supported

by a most extraordinary observation of ITadlcr, who, during the whole
evening of April 7, 1833, saw Venus surrounded by long bright immovable
rays. Professor ZciUner, of Leipzic, strongly advocates this idea, and trusts
that the spectroscope will reveal bright lines in the grey light of the unillu-

--mined hemisphere of Venus.
   3. Proper light. An explication upheld by Pastorff, who supposed the

atmosphere of the planet to be large and self-luminous. Possibly also the
planet might still be incandescent, as is supposed to be the case of Jupiter by
Mr. jS'asmyth; but on this supposition the secondary light should be always

--visible, which is positively not the case.
    4. The light of the Earth. This, as seen from Venus, far exceeds the
greatest brightness of Venus as seen by us; and according to the calculation
of Dr. Pthuinaucr, of ilunich (Grundziige der Photometrie, 1861, pp. 58-77),
the grey light of Venus, if resulting from this cause, should equal a star of
the 14th magnitude. That this explanation is insufficient is so clear as to
need no further proof.

   5. Negative visibiliti/, as it is called by Arago, or projection on the coronal
light of the sun, as suggests Mr. Lynn (Astr. Reg. No. 109, p. 12) and, if

I am right, Mr. Noble (Month. Not. vol. xxxii. p. 17). This explanation

suits only those cases in which the unillumiued side of the planet was seen
darl-er thau the surrounding sky (Messrs. Browning and Noble), but not
those of the majority of observers, who make it brighter than the sky.

  --6. Accidental combustion and other illumining processes. Gruithuisen

suggests large luxuriant forests set on fire, an idea by no means absurd iu
itself; but, indulging in the fantastic cast of his mind, he brings it in
connexion with general religious festivals of the inhabitants of Venus, a
speculation in which it is not quite easy to follow the famous Munich seleno-
grapher. Immense prairies and jungles would do still better ; but even
these will hardly suffice for so frequent and general a phenomenon.

   I wUl suggest another explanation, without laj-ing too much stress on it,
though perhaps it is not a mere fancy. The intense brightness of Venus,
and particularly the dazzling splendour of her bright limb, is deemed by the
late G. P. Bond and by Professor ZoUner, a competent authority in photo-

metric matters, not to be explicable without assuming specular reflection on
the surface of the planet. This Professor ZoUner supposes to be done by a
general covering of water ; and iudeed if the faint grey spots of Venus,
delineated in 1726 by Bianchiui and rediscovered by Vico in 1838, are land,
then nine tenths at least of the surface of Venus are covered by sea. Should
Venus be in a geologically less advanced state, viz. less cooled than our
globe, a supposition rendered not improbable by her considerable size and
her nearness to the sun, then the present condition of Venus would be

analogous to that of the earth in the Jurassic period, when large isolated
islands were bathed by immense seas, blood-warm, and teeming with an

abundance of animal life difficult to be conceived.
--40S EEPORT 1873.

   The intensity of the phosphorescence of the sea, shown not unfrequently
by our tropical seas, gives us some idea of the intensity which this mag-
nificent phenomenon could acquire under such unusual circumstances ; and

it is, I think, not unreasonable to expect that such a phosphorescence could
be seen even at planetary distances. It would explain the fact that the

edge of the dark hemisphere of Venus is seen brighter than its central
part ; for it is demonstrable by calculation and confirmed by observation (as

in the case of the sea near the horizon, or the edge of the full moon), that a

rough surface emitting diffused light is seen the brighter the more obliquely

it is regarded.

myIt is satisfactory to think that  suggestion can be put to the test of

physical inquirj^. M. Pasteur found the spectrum of cucuyos (tropical

phosphorescent beetles) a continuous one ; and, according to Mr. Piazzi Smyth,

the same holds good for the phosphorescent animalculse of the sea (Month.
Not. vol. xxxii. p. 277), so that the spectroscope wiU be able to decide be-
tween Professor Ziillner's hypothesis and mine.

   Since the foregoing note was read before the British Association, Dr. H.
Vogel has published observations of Venus with the large refractor of Baron

Billow (Beobachtungen auf der Sternwarte zu Bothkamp, Heft 2, pp. 118-

132). He saw the secondary light of Venus on seven mornings between

October 15 and November 12, 1871, in bright twilight. The light was

yellowish, faint, brighter near the terminator, fading away on the other
side, and never extended over more than 30° of arc on Venus. On five

other mornings nothing was seen.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. Rolleston, Dr. Sclater,

   Dr. Anton Dohrn, Professor Huxley, Professor Wyville Thom-
   son, and E. Ray Lankester, for the foundation of Zoological
   Stations in different j^orts of the Globe. Braivn vp by Anton

   Dohrn, Secretary.

The Committee beg to report that since the last Meeting the building of the

Zoological Station at Naples has been completed. [A photograph of the

building was exhibited at the Meeting when the Kcport was read.]

The internal, mechanical, and scientific arrangements require two months

for completion ; and though the cost of the whole has exceeded the esti-

mates in no small degree. Dr. Dohrn hopes nevertheless to balance them by

finding new means of income for the establishment. He has succeeded in

obtaining a subsidy of .£1500 from the German Empire, and his scheme of

letting working-tables in the laboratories of the station has met with general

approval . Two tables have been let to Prussia and iiuo to Italy, one to Bavaria,

one to Baden, and one to the University of Strasburg ; a letter from the

Dutch Ministry of the Interior informs Dr. Dohrn that Holland accepts the

offer of one table for the stipulated annual payment of ^'75 ; and, moreover.

Dr. Dohrn has been informed that the University of Cambridge intends to hire

one table for three years. Applications have also been made to the Imperial

Government of Russia, both on the part of Dr. Dohrn and by different

ARussian scientific authorities.  correspondence has taken place between

Dr. Dohrn and Professors Lovcn and Steenstrup about a possible participation

of the Scandinavian kingdoms, but has as yet led to no definite result. The
case with respect to Switzerland and Saxony has been similar ; but hopes are
entertained that these countries may join the others in their endeavour to
support the Zoological Station, and to afford every facility to their naturalists

of profiting by this new and powerful instrument of investigation.
   Dr. Dohrn thinks it desirable to explain once more the leading ideas that

have induced him to request the assistance of all these Governments and

Universities.

   The Zoological Station has sprung up altogether in consequence of the
desire to facilitate investigation in marine zoology, and to enable naturalists
to pursue their studies in the most effective manner and with the greatest
possible economy of money, time, and energy. All zoologists who have

visited Naples during the "last year (amongst whom have been Professors

Gegenbaur, Glaus, Oscar Schmidt, and Pagenstiicher) consider that this end
will be fully attained by the organization and arrangements made or intended
to be made in the station. They all agree that it is in the highest degree

desirable that nobody who cares at all for the progress of zoology should fail

to join Dr. Dohrn's exertions in bringing about a universal participation in

the expense of keeping up the new establishment ; and thus it is due to Pro-
 fessor Oscar Schmidt's influence that the Imperial Government at Berlin have

hired a table for the University of Strasburg, and to the initiative of Pro-

fessor Pagenstacher that the Grand Duchy of Baden has also taken one table,

 whilst Professor Claus has promised his best services to induce the Austrian

 Government to take a similar step.

    As is, we believe, universally known, no money-speculation whatever is
 contemplated by the founder of the Naples Station, in so far as money specu-

 lation means a high interest and the return of the capital invested into the
 pocket of the founder. Nevertheless, every honest means will be used to
 procure as large an income as possible, for more than one reason. There is
 not only the necessity incumbent upon the establishment to repay some of the
 capital to those who have lent money to Dr. Dohrn, in order that he might

 complete the building in its actual enlarged state (a task for which his own
 means would not have sufficed in spite of the German Government's subsidy),

 but, further, there must be provided reserve-funds for the eventuality that the

 income of the aquarium may not cover the outlay for the year's manage-

 ment, thus causing a sudden stand-still of the establishment : and last, but

 not least, it is intended to have every year a certain sum to spend for scien-
 tific pursuits. If, for instance. Professor du Bois Eeymond, as he has ex-

 pressed to Dr. Dohrn his wish to do, should proceed to Naples to carry

  on experiments on the electric Torpedo, it would require no inconsider-
  able means to buy the necessary apparatus and physiological instruments,

  and to provide this famous physiologist every day with fresh material to

  conduct his investigations on a scale large enough to yield a distinct result.
  Or to enable embryologists to carry on an investigation on Comparative
  Selacliian embryology, it would be necessary to buy large quantities of feraale
  sharks and skates, which are by no means so cheap as a foreigner might

  think. And for conducting researches well and accurately, every naturalist
 knows what an amount of money must be spent in dredging-expeditions, how
  much trouble, how much time and work arc necessary to get at the animals
  and to determine their identity or non-identity with the known and described
  species. And this is one of the foremost duties which tbe Zoological Station
  will propose to itself, as it is too well known how great a confusion exists

  with regard to systematic and zoological questions of the Mediterranean
                                                    --

fauna. To bring this confusion to an end, it will require more than one
lustrum and more than one thousand pounds. There may perhaps have
risen a prejudice among Sj-stematists against the new establishment, as one
which, in consequence of the partiality of its leader for Darwinian views,
might dispense altogether with Systematists. Nothing could be more erro-
neous than such an opinion. The leader of the Zoological Station is as little

opposed to Systematists as the Darwinian theory itself. He is of opinion that
zoological battles may be best won, according to Count Moltke's principle, " by

marching separately and fighting conjunctively," thus leaving to Systema-

tists their own route, as well as to anatomists, physiologists, and embryolo-
gists, on condition only that they will, when meeting the enemy (Error and

Ignorance), fight together ; and he desires the Zoological Station to become

such a battle-field, where all the different zoological armies may meet and
fight their common adversaries.

   That such wars need much of the one element, which, according to

Montecuculi, best secures victory, " money, money, money," will be illustrated
by two letters, which Dr. Dohrn has received from Professor Louis Agassiz,
and which he has been authorized to publish.

   The celebrated American naturalist writes, uuder the date " Museum of

Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Mass., 10 June, 1873," the following :

   " It is a great pleasure and satisfaction to me that I can tell you how,
in consequence of the munificence of a wealthy New York merchant, it has
become my duty to erect an establishment whose main object will be similar

--to that of your Naples Station, only that teaching is to be united with it. The

thing came thus to pass : During last winter I applied to our State autho-

rities to secure more means for the Museum in Cambridge (Mass.). Among

the reasons I alluded to the necessity of having greater means for teaching

purposes. I addressed my speech to our deputy, and it was afterwards re-
ported in the newspapers. By chance the report fell into the hands of a rich
and magnanimous tobacco-manufacturer, Mr. John Anderson, of New York.
He sent on the same day a telegram, asking me whether I would be at homo

the following day in order to meet two friends : to which I answered, Yes ! The

two gentlemen came by order of Mr. Anderson, offering me a pretty island in

Buzzard Bayfor the purpose of erecting a zoological school. I accepted this offer,
of course, but added that without farther pecuniary means it would be difficult

to teach there. After two days a sum of .50,000 dollars was handed over to me
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and now I am erecting there a school for Natural History, which at the same

time will be, as a Zoological Station in the immediate neighbourhood of the

Gulf-stream, of the greatest assistance to our zoologists, especially as splendid

dredging-ground exists there. This certainly must greatly promote zoological
study in the United States. Already forty teachers of our normal and high
schools have applied for this summer's lessons ; besides, I shall be accompanied

by my pxivate students.
   " Some of my colleagues are ready to assist me, so that I may hope to

obtain already some results before winter's appi'oach."
   The next letter is dated " Penikese, August 13th, 1873," and contains

some more information.

   " The school was opened on the 8th of July. Some of my friends have
assisted me as teachers ; several other naturalists are occupied with special

studies; the bottom of the sea is very rich, the general situation quite
excellent. The solitude which prevails is a great help for our teaching pur-
poses. As students, forty teachers of our public schools are present, besides

ten younger gentlemen, who are preparing for a scientific career.

   These letters prove that the name of this Committee has not been iU-chosen
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

for though the American Zoological Station has not been founded by its direct

intervention, there can be little doubt that the foundation of the Zoological

Station at Naples has been the signal for a new and powerful movement to

assist zoological research.

Of course the American station has met with such extraordinary advantages

that a competition between it and the Naples Station, as regards means and

favourable circumstances, would be all but hopeless for the latter. Neverthe-

less it may prove a jiowerful instrument in carrying out strictly the self-support-
ing principle, by earning money through the aquarium, and by letting tables
in the laboratory. And though any act of munificence to the Naples Station
is exceedingly desirable and would be heartily welcomed (as the moment has
not yet arrived when any scientific establishment in this world has at its
disposal more money than it can spend), the greatest stress will always be

laid upon these two elements.

The Reporter is further glad to state that the library of the Zoological

AStation has constantly been augmented.      magnificent gift has been made

by the Zoological Society of London, which has presented a complete set of its
illustrated ' Proceedings.' The B-oyal Academies of Copenhagen, Naples, and

Berlin have also granted their biological publications, and promised to continue

to do so in future. The Senckenberg Institute in J?rankfort-on-the-Main,

as well as the Zoological Garden of that city, have sent all their Transactions
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

so has the Smithsonian Institution in Washington with respect to its biological

pubHcations. Well-fovmded hopes are entertained that in a short time many

other Academies and scientific Societies will follow the example of those above

mentioned.

German publishers have continued to send their biological publications

gratis to the library of the Station ; and great quantities of books, pamphlets,
and publications, in separate form, of papers published in periodicals have

been forwarded from all parts of the scientific world through the kindness of

the authors.

   On the part of the Zoological Station, though still in an embryonic state,

considerable activity has been displayed with regard to furnishing continental

zoologists with collections of well-preserved maiine animals. Thiis, Prof.
"Wilhelm MiiUer, indeed, has been supplied with Amphioxus and Tunicata,

Prof. Greeff, of Marburg, with lai-ge quantities of Echinodermata; mixed col-

lections of every kind of animals have been sent to Prof. Oscar Schmidt,

during next winter and work in the Station ; a similar announcement is
made from au Italian zoologist and from Dr. M. Foster ; and I am informed
that two J'oung English biologists -will arrive at the Station in January.

   The Committee hope this Eeport will convince the Association that the

siderable progress for the Zoological Station at j!^aples. The Committee
refrain from making any further proposition to the Association, but express
their wish that every influence may be used to secure to the Station at Naples
such assistance as will serve to promote the eminent scientific ends for which
it has been erected.

   William Jolly, and Dr. James Bryce, appointed for the purpose
    of collecting Fossils from localities of difficult access in North-

    western Scotland. Drawn up by William Jolly, Secretary.

DuEiNG the past j^ear search has been made for fossils at various points along
the great limestone strike of the N.W. Highlands, but, with the exception of
the Durness basin, from which the fossils already collected have been alone
obtained, none have been found at any new locality. The lessee of the
lime-kilns of Loch Eribol has been obliged to give them up. This the Com-
mittee have to regret on their own account, as, from his interest in the
subject, they anticipated good results from the intelligent search he was
making in the large development of limestone in that interesting locality, which
till now has continued barren of organic forms. Special search has been
made by two teachers in the limestone at Inchnadamph on Loch Assynt, but
as yet without success. The Committee have not been fortunate enough to
find any thing in this locality, except one piece found by the Secretary,
which it is hoped may prove to be organic.

    None of the Committee have this year found it possible to prosecute the
search in pei'son ; but this continues to be done by several gentlemen resi-
dent in the district, whose services they have been fortunate in securing.

    The Committee have, during the last two years, gathered a considerable
number of specimens. These fossils, with those obtained for Professor Nicol

of Aberdeen, and deposited in the College Museum there, they think it impor-

tant that the Association should have carefully examined by an adept in
fossil remains, in order to lead to more certain determination of the age and
place of these North-western rocks in the geologic series. They think, how-
ever, that this examination should not be made till a larger collection has
been obtained. As the discovery of fossils at other localities than Durness
is most desirable, especially in order to determine if the fossiliferous Durness
limestone is the same as that in the line of the great .strike from Eribol to
 Skye, they are anxious that the search should still be prosecuted in these
hitherto barren localities. The Committee would therefore propose their
 reappointment by the Association for this purpose.

The Committee, in presentiug its Fifth Report, has to state that it has con-

tinued that part of the inquiry for which it was more particularly reap-

pointed, viz. the examination of the typical case of sewage-farming at

Breton's Farm near Romford; and similar Tables to those furnished last

j'car are again supplied, and are described in the portion of this Report

referring to this subject.

Another analysis has also been made of the soil of the farm, showing a con-

siderable increase in the amount of nitrogen and of phosphoricacid contained

in it.

  A further examination has also been made of the sewage-farm at Earls-

wood, with more satisfactory results than on previous occasions ; and Dr. Gilbert

has again furnished a note on the dry earth system, which he has made a

subject of special investigation.

Whitthread's process, which was described in 'last year's Report, and of

which a short account wiU be found in the subjoined abstract, has been for

Aa few days at work on a considerable scale at Entield.  member of the

Committee, who recently inspected what was going on there, states that an

excellent opportunity for further investigation will now be afforded.

It has been considered advisable at this time, when the Committee has

(Avithin a few pounds) exhausted its funds, to prepare and present with this
Report an abstract of the four previous Reports made by it to the British

Association ; this has been done by Professor Corfield on its behalf, and the

abstract will be found in another part of this Report.

Since the Committee's last Report the Local Government Board has pre-

sented to Parliament a Retui'n moved for in the House of Commons, dated

May 13th, 1873, and entitled a " Return of the names of Boroughs, Local

Boards, Parishes, and Special Drainage Districts which have, through loans,

provided Sewage-Farms or other means for the Disposal of Sewage by Fil-

tration or Precipitation." The various Tables contained in this Return

profess to give information, which, so far as it goes, would be vahiable if

exact. One radical error in the scheme of the Tables is, that there is no

separation of the capital expenditure and working expenses of the year, while

in the case of sewage-farms the cost of purchasing land is not separated from

that of works.

               Section I. Additional Note on the Dry Earth System.

   In former Reports the Committee has given the results obtained by
Dr. Gilbert on the determination of the nitrogen in the soil which had been
tised in a Moule's earth-closet once, twice, and three times. The same soil,
after passing through the closet the fourth time, has been again examined,
and the results of the series of determinations are given below :

                   Section III. jBretoii's Farm, Romford.

The systematic observations hitherto carried on with regard to this farm

(for a record of which see i^rcvious Reports and the following abstract) have

been continued during the past year, and the form of last year's Tables has

been again adopted to set out the results arrived at.

                                                                      tons.

The quantity of sewage received from the town of Romford into

the tanks and pumped on to land from March 25th, 1872, to

March 24th, 1873 (inclusive), is according to the gaugings. . 405,443

The quantity of eiiluent water repuraped on to laud during the

                        Accounted for thus :

As appears by the cropping Table the quantity of

sewage applied to the land is                          523,810 tons.

   Tables I. & II. are continuations of the Tables of last year bearing the same

numbers, and are records of the observations made with regard to the quan-
tity and composition of the sewage and the effluent water. From the organic
nitrogen column in Table II., referring to the effluent water, it will be seen
that an improvement has taken jilace, due probably to the solidifying of the

earth over the drains ; the proportions of total nitrogen in the effluent water
for the two years show a difference of only 0-01 in 100,000 parts.

   Table III. shows the absolute quantities of nitrogen contained in the
sewage and in the effluent water, as calculated from the details summarized
in Tables I. and II.

   From this it will be seen that the volume of sewage distributed was con-

siderably greater than in the previous year ; but the proportion of nitrogen
was smaller, indicating a greater dilution due to the large increase in rainfall.

   It would appear that the total amount of nitrogen distributed on the farm
was 26-9814 tons, while the previous year's total would appear from the Table
to have been only 21-0245 tons ; but the explanation is that during the previous
year a large quantity of undiluted sewage, namely 83,902 tons, " was run
upon a plot of land at the lower part of the farm by gravitation, and simply
filtered during periods when it could not l)e put on the farm, owing to further-
drainage-works being in progress." The amount of nitrogen which must be
added to last year's total to make it compai'able with this year's is 0-1904
tons, which makes 27-2209 tons, or practically the same quantity as this year.
--416 REPORT 1873.

   The quantity of effluent water measured was 470,552 tons as against only
195,536 tons last year. This is to be accounted for partly by the greater
dilution by rain, indicated by a difference of 0-01 of nitrogen per 100,000
parts in the composition of the effluent water, but principally by the fact

that the extra drainage alluded to in the last Report has been carried out.
Although, therefore, the effluent water this year shows less total nitrogen per
100,000 parts, yet the absolute quantity contained in it amounted to i
instead of -^ of the absolute quantity distributed over the farm.

    Tables IV. to VI. are similar to the corresponding Tables of last year, and
are subject to the same qualifications with regard to the quantities of sewage
applied to the various crops and plots ; that is to sa^^ that the means available
for the measurement of the quantities of sewage and effluent water only
rendered possible the actual measurement of the total daily quantities, the
details professing to show approximately the quantities applied to the
individual crops and plots being merely calculated numbers obtained from
the daily totals by breaking these up in proportion to the areas irrigated each
day. The chief value of these figures is to show the desirability of obtaining
such details with precision. This, however, would require a numerous staff
of trained chemical and engineering assistants, and also the expenditure of a
considerable sum of money in apparatus, and in isolating, by means of sunken

barriers of concrete, the individual plots.

   By comparing Tables V. and VI. of this year with Tables V. and VI. of

last year, it will be found that the total produce taken off the farm during the
year ending March 2-lth, 1873, was 1704 tons against 2714 for the pre-
ceding year. This was due partly to the fact that tlie area in standing crop

on March 24th, 1873, was 87-62 acres against 4049 acres on March 24th,

 1872 (see Table VIT.), and partly to the fact that there were 26-18 acres of

cereals in the j'ear now recorded, against 0-9 of an acre in the previous year.
    The nitrogen recovered in the ci'ops taken off the land for the year under

 review is estimated at 15,704 lbs. as against 19,067 lbs. for the preceding
 year. This smaller quantity recovered out of a larger quantity applied is
 obviously due to the same causes which affected the weight of crops.

    The nitrogen escaping in the effluent water is estimated at 11,973 lbs., as
 against 5024 lbs. in the previous year. This increase is due to the additional
 drainage of the farm giving a larger measured quantity of effluent water as
 before explained, namely 470,552 tons as against 195, .536 tons.

    The amount of nitrogen unaccounted for (that is to say, accumulated in
 the standing crops and top soil, washed into the subsoil, or lost) is the differ-
 ence between that applied in the sewage (60,438 lbs.) and the sum of the

--quantities recovered in the crops (15,704 lbs.) and escaping in the effluent

 water (11,973 lbs.) namely, 32,701 lbs., as against 22,404 lbs. unaccounted
 for in the previous year.

     These quantities, expressed in percentages, show that of every 100 parts of
 nitrogen distributed over the farm in the sewage, 26 were recovered and
 taken off the farm in crops, 20 escaped in the effluent water, and 54 remained
 in the standing crops, in the soil, or in the subsoil, or were lost.

     This nitrogen balance-sheet shows that the results of an experiment in
  agricultural chemistry over so extended an area, and with so great a variety
  of crops, can only give true averages if condiicted over a lengthened series of

 years ; for the produce of the farm was in many respects moi-e satisfactory in
 the year now recorded than in the preceding one, liaving regard to the amount
  of cereals grown and the crops left standing, and yet at first sight it appears

  the reverse.

   In the Ecport of the Committee presented at Liverpool it was stated, on
the authority of information furnished by the local authorities, that

       (1) The population of Romford was " about 8000 ;"
       (2) That the refuse of about 7000 persons was discharged entirely into

                 the sewers
        (3) That the whole population is within the area provided with under-

               ground sewers.

   As the Committee had some doubts as to the correctness of these statements,
it was thought advisable to have a census of the town, with particulars of

sewage connexions, &c. made, and the results will be found in Table VIII.
    Samples of soil were very carefully taken on April 30th, 1873, in presence

of Messrs. Corfield, Gilbert, Grantham, Hope, and Williamson, at the same part
of the farm as on the previous occasion (July 15th, 1870), when no sewage had
been applied to that part of the farm. These samples were mixed, and an
average sample was analyzed by Dr. Eussell with the following results :

culated from the original soil) of the more important constituents of the G4-23
parts of undried soil. Comparing these results -nith those given in the Com-
mittee's Second Keport, it will be seen that the phosphoric acid in the soil has

increased from 0-01 to 0-058 per cent., that the loss on ignition of the soil

is much greater (leaving water out of the question), that the amount of am-

monia has been increased from an inappreciable quantity to 0-OlG per cent.,
and that the amount of nitrates has been also increased. The amount of total
nitrogen in the 64-23 parts of soil was estimated by the soda-lime process

       = 0-121 per cent. Nitrogen.

There is therefore no doubt that the quality of the soil has been conside-

rably improved by the sewaging, and that a good deal, both of the nitrogen

and phosphoric acid, is retained in it,

An Ahstract of the Four MepoHs already presented to the Association hy the

           Committee. Prepared for the Committee by Professor Coefield.

    In the following Abstract of the four Eeports already presented to the

Association by the Committee, I have thoiight it best to bring together the

results of the Committee's investigations under a few heads ; so that each

division of the subject may appear in the Abstract complete in itself, and not
split up into portions, as would have been the case had each Report been

abstracted separately.

                                               I. Conservancy Plans.

   A series of Eeports " from foreign countries respecting the practices pre-

vailing abroad for disposing of the refuse of towns, villages, public institutions,

factories, dwellings, &c., and having reference to the sanitary condition of the

dLstricts in which they are situated, the state of rivers, or the support and
increase of the produce of the soil," was obtained by. the Committee from Her

Majesty's Secretary of State for the Home Department ; and from these it

appeared " that in most cases (both in town and country places) the use of

privies is very general, water-closets being rare even in large towns, and

that the usual method of dealing with human excreta is to allow them to

collect in pits (Abtrittsgruben, fosses), which aro sometimes drained either

naturally ;by the permeable character of the soil, or artificially, so that most

or all of the licpid portion of the contents of the pits flows away or infiltrates

the surrounding soil." (lleport I. 1869, pp. 318-321.)
    Information was also obtained from 107 places in the United Kingdom,

Laving an aggregate population of more than four millions. It was found
that in 42 of these the privy and ash-pit system was general, and in 25
partial ; while in 71 places out of the 107 the liquid refuse of the town was
discharged into the adjoining stream or river, and in two instances into pools
of water. (Ecport I. p.. 32.5.)

    In the Second Ecport the returns from 200 towns, " recording the existing

--arrangements of water-supply, sewerage, scaveiigering, and disposal of

refuse," are tabulated the result being that there were 70 of these towns
where " privies very greatly exceed water-closets in number," and 75 in which
" privies are still raueh used," (Eeport II. 1870, p. 53.)

    Privies, both in England and abroad, were found to be frequently built
over rivers (Eeport I. pp. 318-321, and Eeport II. p. 59) ; and in some towns

many houses are without any provision whatever for the removal of the

excremental matters.

    It was found that in only two instances in England, and one in Scotland,
was any profit derived "from the sale of ashes and excretal and other
solid refuse," the losses of some towns being considerable (Eeport II.
p. 55). The Committee specially investigated the ash-pit system as carried

--out at the town o£ Eury in Lancashire, for two reasons " because it is a

town where it may be said there are no water-closets," and because " the

almost total absence of water-closets " would enable the Committee, by exa-
mining the liquid escape into, and discharge from, the sewers, to judge whether
any of the proposed methods of intercepting fsaeeal matter from the sewers
(such, for instance, as the earth-closet) would in themselves be either a solu-
tion of the great sewage question, or even one considerable step towards it.

    It was found that the privy accommodation of the lower classes of houses
was very insufficient--that the removal of the mixed night-soil was found to
be difficult and expensive, so that the quantity obtained from the whole

town only realized ^100 per annum--and that, in spite of the fact that bo
ON THE TREATMENT AND UTILIZATION 01*' SEWAGE.  439

much refuse matter was kept out of the sewers, the sewage during the greater
part of the day was, as shown by chemical analysis, only a little weaker
than that of a water-closetcd town usually is, while during the forenoon it
was invariably " very thick, black, and greasy," and " smelt very bad ;" and

the Subcommittee appointed to consider the matter reported, " that although
the sewage from a town managed on the Bury system is weaker, and there-
fore less valuable, and proportionately more difficult to deal with than the
sewage from a water-closeted town, yet that its purification is just as im-
peratively necessary." The Subcommittee considered that "the figures
obtained in Bury, of the ash-pit system as carried out there, prove that
financially it is, so far as Bury is concerned, a total and complete failure, as
the gross return is only a little over one halfpenny per head of the popula-
tion annually."

   lu many towns, especially abroad, portable or fixed reservoirs (fosses) for
the collection of excretal matters, unmixed with other substances, are iu

general use. Sometimes they are drained into sewers, and sometimes so
constructed as to collect both liquid and solid refuse, contrivances to
separate the solid from the liquid excreta being sometimes employed. These
reservoirs are " frequently ventilated by means of shafts rising above the
house-tops." The fixed reservoirs are emptied periodically, their contents
either being " simply dipped out," or " removed cither by pumping into
closed tank-carts with lift-pumps, or by means of a vacuum jDreviously pro-
duced in the tank-cart." The portable reservoirs are removed bodily with
their contents, and replaced by empty ones. At some towns a profit is realized,
while at others a loss is entailed ; but the communications received from
foreign countries afforded " abundant evidence that, wherever the subject has
been considered, there is a strong though vague sense of the injury to
health resulting from the accumulation of excretal materials iu pits &c.
within populous districts, by the impregnation of the soil, by the pollution of
rivers and well-water with drainage from such accumulations, or from the

discharge of excretal materials into watercourses directly or indirectly."

&(Report I. pp. 321 322.)

                                               JDi'iJ Earth Syxtem.

    In the 200 scheduled towns before referred to, only 446 earth-closets were
reported to exist. The Committee inquired into the results of this system
at several places, but only obtained a return from Lancaster, " the only
place where an attempt has been made to carry out the system on a largo
scale," where it appeared that the system was not thoroughly carried out,
some of the essential conditions to its success being entirely neglected. Thus,
instead of the dried earth being used in detail, " a quantity of soil is thrown
once a day on the matters collected ; and the result is that the product is
removed in a very offensive condition." "When it is stated that about 2| lbs.
of soil were used per head per day, and that the manure was afterwards
mixed with other town refuse, it is uot surprising that it only fetched 5.?. a
ton, and that its analysis showed " that it did not contain more nitrogen
than good garden-mould," and that, on being applied to grass laud at the
rate of about six tons per acre, " the produce of hay was by no means large."

    Dr. Gilbert conducted, on behalf of the Committee, some experiments with
Moule's earth system. The result showed that earth which had been used even.
three times iu the closet could only be considered to be a rich garden-mould ;
and the Committee remarked " that such a manure, even if diajiosed of free
of charge, would bear carriage to a very short distance on)y."

   The following Table shows the results of these analyses, as far as the

nitrogen is concerned :

   Only vague information was obtained about the ventilation of the sewers,
" owing to the fact that very few instances exist in which any thing has been

systematically done." The Committee in their First Eeport stated that this

was a most important matter for consideration, and " that it would be in the

highest degree desirable to institute an inquiry into the nature of the

gaseous emanations from the sewers in various places " (Report I. p. 330).
They consequently instituted some experiments, both chemical and microsco-

pical, on air collected from some sewers in Paddington. Dr. Eussell's analyses

showed that the carbonic acid varied from 0-12 to 0-51 per cent., and the

oxygen from 20-7 to 20-91 per cent. ; while no combustible gases were detected,

and only a trace of ammonia could be discovered in Avater through which a

large quantity of sewer air had been passed. The remark is made that
" these experiments must be looked upon as simply tentative, but certainly

indicate a purer air in these sewers than might have been anticipated." The

microscopical examination conducted by Mr. Cooke showed that the suspended

substances which were collected by passing air through tubes containing

plugs of cotton-wool were very various, and consisted of inorganic matters,

a few starch-granules, and spores of various sizes, together with fragments of

cellular tissue, woody fibre, fibrils of feathers, &c. The general results, how-

ever, indicated " comparative freedom from organic bodies." (Eeport II.

pp. 72-75.)

The Committee made a special investigation into the sewerage arrange-

ments of the town of Cambridge, where water-closets are general, though

not universal. The outlets of all the sewers were found to be under the

level of the surface-water in the Cam, so that " the sewage is backed up in

the sewers for a considerable distance ; and the subsoil is constantly saturated

with both water and sewage in the lowest parts of the town." As many of

the sewers are old and of irregular shape, much escape into the subsoil takes

place. " Inquiries were made into the state of some of the wells belonging

to private houses, and it was found that they were all contaminated by

sewage, owing to their proximity to the sewers in the streets and to the

drains on the premises, so much so, that the water cannot be used for drink-

ing but only for washing." The remarks made on the subject by the Sub-

committee, consisting of Messrs. Grantham (Chairman), Corfield, Hope, and

Williamson, finish as follows :--

" The chief general importance of the inquiry into the conditions of Cam-

bridge is the proof thus obtained of the pollution of Avells, and therefore of

subsoil, by the agency of previous street- or house-sewers constructed in their

vicinity                         and the Subcommittee  desires to give  expression to the  conviction
                              ;

forced upon it in the course of its inquiries, that all sewers, properly so

called (that is to say, drains into which refuse from human habitations is

admitted), ought to be constructed of materials which are altogether imper-

vious, and that a separate system of pervious drains, similar to agricultural

drains, shoiild be constructed where necessary to dry the subsoil. The Sub-

committee is of opinion that the further construction of pervious sewers

should be prohibited by Parliamentary enactment." (Eeport II. p. Gl.)
   The amount of sewage discharged varied in the 200 towns scheduled, partly

with the amount of the water-supply, and partly with the amount of surface

--or subsoil waters admitted into the sewers the largest quantity being in the

case of the town of Hertford, where the discharge per head per diem
amounted to 257 gallons, the water-supply being only 61^ gallons ; and tho

smallest, amounting to only six gallons per head per diem^ being recorded in
one or two instances.

442 REPORT~1873.

                                               Treatment of Seivar/e.

    " Of the 189 towns and districts having systems of sewerage, 143 discharge
their sewage without any treatment whatever ; in 17 instances the sewage
is simply filtered before discharge, in 7 instances it is chemically treated,
and in 17 cases recourse is had to irrigation, whilst in 5 instances the

system of disposal includes more than one of these methods." By " simple

filtration " is generally meant mere straining, a method obviously insufEcient

for the purification of sewage.
    Certain processes for precipitating the valuable materials contained in

sewage were investigated by the Committee with the following results :
   I. The PhospJmte Process of Messrs. Forbes and Price, which consists in the

addition to the sewage of (a) a mixture of native phosphate of alumina and
sulphuric acid, and (6) sufficient milk of lime to neutralize the sewage. The
result was that during its passage through a large tank " the suspended
matters were very completely deposited, and the supernatant water ran over
the sloping edge of the tank at its extreme end bright and clear and almost
odourless." It was found that the water did not putrefy, even after the lapse
of four months, that it contained only the merest trace of phosphoric acid,
no sulphuretted hydrogen, nor any nitrates nor nitrites, but that it contained
" as much actual ammonia as ordinary dilute London sewage, and also a certain
*.' amount of albumenoid ammonia." The precipitate had no offensive smell.
The valuable constituents of sewage, with the exception of the suspended
matters and the phosphoric acid, are not precipitated by this process, and
cannot be utilized unless the effluent water be afterwards used for irrigation,
in which case the milk of lime would not be added, and the clarified sewage
would still contain a quantity of phosphoric acid.

    " The advantage of this use of it, if it were found to answer from an
economical point of view, would be the deodorization of the deposit in the
tanks and of the sewage itself, which is certainly at present a great deside-
ratum, especially as regards the tanks." (Report III. pp. 185-187.)

  --II. WliitthrecuVs Patent. Experiment was made on 100 gallons of Eom-
--ford sewage with one pound of the mixture used in this process a mixture

which was stated to consist of dicalcic and monocalcic phosphate, two equi-

valents of the former to one of the latter, a little milk of lime being after-

wards added. The result was a very rapid precipitation, the supernatant
water remaining nearly clear and quite inoffensive. The precipitate, dried
at 100° C, contained as much as 3 per cent, of ammonia and a considerable
quantity of phosphate of lime. The supernatant water contained rather
more actual ammonia than the original sewage, but scarcely any organic
nitrogen, showing that the organic matters in solution, as well as those in
suspension, had been almost entirely removed by the process. This water con-
tained, however, a considerable quantity of phosphoric acid, which would be
valuable if the water were afterwards used to irrigate land ; " but, unless
means are devised for separating it, it would constitute a serious loss if the
water were thrown away." It must be added that tliis was regarded merely

--as a preliminary experiment.
    III. Gemral Scott's Process. This was investigated at Ealing. It con-
 sists in the addition to the sewage, while in the sewers, of a mixture of lime
 and clay, in the proportion of about 10 cwt. of the former and 5 cwt. of
the latter to 400,000 gallons of sewage. The result was a very complete
precipitation of the suspended matters, which were collected in tanks, tho
supernatant water being passed upwards through filter-bods, and discharged
ON THE TREATMENT AND UTILIZATION OF SEWAGE.  443

 into the river. The sludge from the tanks is cli-awn. off from time to time,
 partially dried by an hydraulic press, and then biu'nt in a kUn, no additional

 fuel being necessary after the firo is once started, as the dried sludge con-

 tains sufficient organic matter to burn the deposit. The result is the pro-
 duction of cement. It was found that the sewage was rendered inodorous
 while in the sewers, and that the whole process was inoffensive.

    The Committee considered that " on the whole this process, when per-

--fected, promises well as a means of treating one of the difficiUties of the

 sewage question the disposal of the sludge precipitated from sewage. It
appears not only possible to destroy the solid matters by fire, but also to
 secure some return from their use in the manufacture of cement."

    They found, however, that the efiiuent water contained organic matters in
 solution as well as ammonia ; so that this process cannot be considered as suffi-

 cient of itself for the purification of sewage, nor for its utilization, but only as
one for satisfactorily getting rid of the offensive sludge which otherwise accu-
mulates in the tanks.

                                                                    Filtration.

  --Upward Filtration. The process of upward filtration through gravel was

examined at Ealing when General Scott's process was in abeyance. It was

found that this process, whether accompanied or not by the addition of a
deodorizing mixture to the sewage in the sewers in the town, " effected only
a very slight purification of the sewage, which left the filter still a sewage of
average strength. It was not even clarified." This observation thus con-
firmed the results of experiments previously carried out by the Rivers' Pol-
lution Commissioners.

  --Weares Process. This process, which is employed at the "Workhouse at

^toke-upon-Trent, where the water-supply is very scanty and the sewage
consequently remarkably strong, consists in the filtration of the sewage
through coarse ashes and charcoal contained in the tanks through which it
passes successively. It appeared to be considerably purified ; but still the
effluent water after passing through the deodorizing tanks is described by
Dr. RusseU as having a strong smell of sewage. It is also to be observed
that no nitrates were found in this water, thus showing that no oxidation

had taken place. Prom the fact that the flow of effluent water was only
about 2000 gallons as against 5000 gallons of sewage in the 24 hours, and
that the chlorine was reduced to nearly half its original amount, the reduc-

tion taking place almost entirely in the first or so-caUed frecal tank, it would

appear that a considerable dilution must in some way have taken place,

accompanied by a very considerable and unexplained escape, which amounted
even supposing there were no dilution, to three fifths of the total amount.

                                         Intermittent clownivarcl Filtration.

    This process was examined at Troedyrhyw, near ITerthyr Tidfyl, where an
area of about 20 acres has been converted into a filter-bed for the purifica-
tion of the sewage of the town of Merthyr Tidfyl. The soU consists chiefly
of gravel and sand, having a vegetable-mould on the surface. It is extremely
porous. The land is drained at a depth of less than 7 feet, the drains bein"
brought together at the lowest corner, where the effluent water is discharged
into an open drain leading to the river Taff. '·' The area is laid out in square
beds, intersected with roads and paths, along which are constructed the main
carriers which receive the sewage from the outfaU-sewcr, and distribute it

over the beds."
--444 KEPORT 1873.

The sewage, after being screened through a bed of " slag," in which the

larger suspended matters are arrested, is turned on to one of the four plots

into which the area is divided, and allowed to run on this plot for six hours,

when it is turned on to another one. Thus each of these four plots has

18 hours for rest and aeration of the soil. The surface of the area is laid

up in ridges, and cabbages and other vegetables planted along them, the

sewage running in furrows between.

   The main results of the examinations which took place in January and in July,

--extending over seven and eight days respectivelj-, were : that the effluent

water discharged was very largely diluted with subsoil- water which had per-

colated through from the river-bed (this was proved both by the gaugings

and by the analyses, and had been already observed by the Elvers' Pollution

Commissioners)                                                                    that the effluent water was very satisfactorily purified, the
                                                                               ;
--nitrogen in solution appearing in the form of nitrates and nitrites a suffi-

cient proof that a considerable amount of oxidation goes on in the filter-beds,

Fpon a comparison of the total nitrogen in solution in the sewage, in the

effluent water, and in the subsoil-water (which was also analysed), it was
found that the amount in the effluent water was almost exactly the amount

that would be present in the sewage if diluted with the amount of subsoil-
water (rather more than its own volume) with which the analyses and the

gaugings showed it to have been diluted ; that is to say, that a quantity

of nitrogen equal to the amount in solution in the sewage escaped in the

effluent water, and was lost (escaping, however, almost entirely in the
oxidized and innocuous form of nitrates, &c.), the amount retained in the soil

and by the plants being, therefore, equal to the amount in the suspended

matters of the sewage. The effluent water was not quite so pure in the

summer as in the winter : in the former case four fifths, and in the latter

twelve thirteenths of the nitrogen contained in it was in the form of nitrates

and nitrites.

   The sewage was cooled by its percolation through the soil ; in the winter
from 48° F. to 46° F. (the temperature of the subsoil-water being 42° F.),
and in the summer from 00° F. to 55° F.

The crops grown on the surface of the filter-beds were successful, and

realized veiy good prices.

                                                                                  Irrigation.

    Iq the First Eeport of the Committee a Hst of fifteen places where irriga-
tion was practised was given, and a list of twelve more where it was con-
templated ; and it was stated that the areas used for irrigation varied from
0-4 of an acre to ten or twelve acres per thousand of the population, the
distance of the land from the lowest outfall sewer of the town vaiying from

100 yards to upwards of a mile.

 --The general result was reported to be as follows : " At most places the

ai^plication of the sewage to land has been found to exercise a most beneficial
influence on the condition of the streams and rivers receiving the drainage of

the district."

    " Generally speaking no objections appear to have been made to the applica-
tion of sewage for irrigation; and where such objections have been urged on the
ground that the appHcation was ofi'cnsive and injurious, they do not appear to
have been supported by medical authority, and in several instances they have
ceased. As regards the sanitary condition of these districts, it appears that
in most cases the application of sewage for irrigation has not been attended
with any apparent change ; but there is said to be a marked improvement at

Braintree.*'

   " It is probable that . . . the application of liquid sewage to land would
become a source of revenue to towns only under specially favourable circum-

stances, and that, in opposition to the opinions which have been somewhat

hastily formed in certain cases, it will more frequently entail some amount

of expenditure on the towns themselves. At the same time the benefit to

land, and the improvement in the condition of rivers, to be realized by the
mode of dealing with liquid sewage, can scarcely be matter of doubt or uncer-

tainty any longer."

Of the 200 towns tabulated in the Second Eeport, 19 had recourse to irriga-

tion either wholly or partially or in connexion with some precipitation pro-
cess ; and in one case, that of Leamington, irrigation was intended, and has
since been carried out.

   Owing to the fact that one of its members is the lessee of Breton's Farm,
near Eomford, in Essex, the Committee has had the advantage of making

continuous investigations of the results of irrigation with this particular farm

for the past three years, results which are detailed in the Annual Reports.

--Special investigations have also been made with the following results : At

the farms at Tunbridgo "Wells, where the sewage is applied to the surface of

the land on the Catch-water System, and where under-drainage has not been

systematically carried out (the drains which already exist having, in fact,
been brought up to the surface to empty into the carriers), the purification of
the sewage cannot be said to be satisfactory ; for althougli a considerable

dilution with subsoil-water takes place, the water which has passed over the
land is still impure, and, moreover, contains scarcely any nitrates, thus
showing that very little oxidizing action takes place.

   The same result was found at the Eeigate Parm at Earlswood, where the
state of the efiiuent water was still more unsatisfactory ; in fact, in one
instance, it was found that sewage which had passed over the fields was
actually stronger, except as regards actual ammonia (?'. e. it contained more

of the total solids in solution with more nitrogenous organic matters), than it

--was after passing over only the first of these fields thus showing that the

ground was so saturated with sewage, that any additional sewage passed on

to it could " only concentrate itself by evaporation or by solution of matters

in the upper layer of the soil." (Eeport III. pp. 181 to 185.)

These farms were again inspected in the following year. It was found

that the efiiuent water was running clear and free from smell. No analyses

were, however, made at this time. The crops included oats, beans, and wheat,

as weU as meadow-grass and Italian rye-grass, and seemed to be in a satisfac-

tory condition; but no general system of subsoil-drainage had been com-

Amenced.              comparison was made in January 1871, during severe frost, of

--the results obtained in the purification of sewage at the three following

farms : Breton's Farm, near Eomford, Beddiugton Farm, Croydon, and

Norwood Farm. It was found that in the latter two cases, where the sewage

was passed over the land on the Catch-water System, it was not satisfactorily

purified, the nitrogen escaping in the efiiuent water being only partially in

the state of nitrates and nitrites ; while in Breton's Farm, where the sewage

passes through the soil, the farm being in eflTect a large filtcr-bcd, " (1) oxi-

dation goes on in winter as well as in summer, and almost all nitrogen lost is

lost in an oxidized and inofi'ensive form, and (2) this loss is very slightly

greater in winter with a very strong sewage than in summer with a weaker

one                   so that sewaging in the winter would  appear to entail no extra loss of
                   ;

manure."

It was also observed that while in summer sewage is cooled by percola-
--446 REPORT 1873.

tion through the soil, and almost always heated (sometimes considerably so)

by surface-flow, as was observed both at Tunbridge WeUs and at Earlswood (the

temperature of the effluent water in the latter case being actually 5° F. higher
than that of the sewage), in winter, on the other hand, the cooling which takes
place is less with percolation thi-ough the soil than with surface-flow in
both instances ; so that " these results are favourable to percolation through

the soil, as opposed to mere surface-flow, both in summer and winter. Per-
colation causes a considerable cooling in the summer, while in winter it does
not cool the effluent water so much as surface-flow does."

 --These results induced the Committee to make the following distinct state-

ment in their Third Report, p. 185 : " It may seem almost superfluous for
the Committee, after so many years of general experience throughout the

country, to argue in favour of the subsoil drainage of naturaUy heavy or
naturally wet land with impervious subsoil for purposes of ordinary agricul-
ture ; but some persons have strongly and repeatedly called in question the

necessity of draining land when irrigated with sewage ; and the two farms at
Tunbridge Wells, to a great extent, and more especially the Eeigate Farm at
Earlswood, have been actually laid ovit for sewage-irrigation on what may be

called the ' saturation principle ; ' so that it appears to the Committee dcsi-
rp.ble to call attention to the fact, that if drainage is necessary where no
water is artificially supplied to the soil, it cannot be less necessary after an
addition to the rainfall of 100 or 200 per cent. But a comparison of the
analyses of different samples of effluent waters which have been taken by the
Committee from open ditches into which effluent water was overflowing off
saturated land, and from subsoil-drains into which effluent water was intermit-
tently percolating through several feet of soil, suggests grave doubts whether
effluent water ought ever to be permitted to escape before it has percolated

through the soil."

    At Breton's Farm, where the sewage of the town of Romford, with a popu-
lation of 6338 (a little more than two thirds of which only discharge their

refuse into the sewers, the previous estimates having been all too high), is

utUized upon 121 acres of land, there are special advantages for accurate in-

vestigation. The soil, which was very poor, consisting in many parts almost
entirely of gravel (as will be seen by the analysis already quoted from the
Committee's Second Report), was laid out in rectangular beds on the Ridge-

 and-Furrow System, the " beds " or "lands," each 30 feet in width, running at
right angles to the main carriers which distribute the sewage. The sewage,

when it arrives on the farm, is received in one of two tanks, where a deposit
takes place and a scum forms on the surface. The liquid is run out between
these into the pumping-weU, and is raised by a pump " to a height of about
25 feet into iron troughs supported on wooden tressels, which convey the

sewage to all parts of the farm, by discharging it either directly into the gut-
 ters or grips formed on the ridges of the ' lands,' and out of which the
sewage is distributed right and left down the slightly inclined slopes of the
lands, or, in the first instance, [into concrete carriers, raised by earth banks
to a height intermediate between the height of the iron troughs and the
level of the ground." (Report II. p. 62.) "About 85 acres of the farm,
 which are above the level of the tank, have been underdrained by pipe-drains
50 yards apart, and from 5 to 6 feet in depth, in such a manner that the water
from the drains can be discharged into the sewage-tank if required in dry
weather, or at pleasure into the river Rom."

     This arrangement afforded excellent opportunities for the gauging of the

effluent water.
        --"

            ON THE TREATMENT AND UTILIZATION OF SEWAGE.  447

   In the Second Report will be found a detailed account of the crops grown
and the prices obtained.

Some of the earliest experiments made by the Committee related to " the

capacity of earth laid out in beds of 30 feet wide for the absorption of liquid."

Three different kinds of gauges were used, and a time was chosen " when the
land was in what may be considered an average state of moisture." From

these experiments " it resulted that land in the state of moisture which

existed on the 19th March [1870] and laid out in beds of 30 feet wide
would only absorb, when consolidated, on the surface about 40 tons of
liquid per acre, and when stirred to a depth of 9 inches on the previous day,
about 90 to 110 tons per acre. By the word 'absorb' is meant that no
more than the above quantities could be applied without the formation of

puddles at the sides of the beds." (Eeport IT. p. 69.) It was considered
that 400 tons per acre was probably the largest quantity that had Qver
been applied in any one dressing, and that the assumption that the first
dressing aU over the farm was at the rate of 400 tons per acre, the second at
that of 200, and the subsequent ones at that of 100 was probably not far from

the truth.

In the Third Eeport, p. 175, will be found a summary of the results of the

gaugings of the sewage and effluent water from June 12th, 1870, to July 15,
1871 (a period of 399 days). It ai^pears that the average quantity of sewage

received from the town per day was 1029 tons, to which something must be
added for night-sewage which was allowed to run on to the meadows between
the farm and the town. After the 15th of April, when the new tanks were
completed and all the sewage received on the farm, the total amount was
found to be 1262| tons in the 24 hours, 621 i tons of which came during the
working day of ten hours, and the remaining 641^ during the night of 14
hours. These quantities, when computed for a day and night of 12 hours

each, give day-sewage 729 tons, night-sewage 533|.
   The sewage as pumped contains a certain amount of effluent water that

has been brought back into the tanks. The average amount of this diluted
sewage pumped was 1182 tons per day. The effluent water discharged, as

far as could be estimated, was about 513^ tons per day. The rainfall during
the 399 days was 22-64 inches, equal to 2287 tons per acre.

    The experiments on the temperatiu'e of the sewage and effluent water are
very important. The temperature of these liquids is very uniform when
compared with that of the air, " being lower during extreme heat, and higher
during extreme cold." " The ranges and variation over the total period have

been :

            " Atmosphere      =2°8-5 to 76    47-5 F.
              Town-sewage     =43 ,, 66 23
              Sewage pumped   =.... 43 ,, 67
              Effluent water                  24
                              =41 ,, 64 23

   In one week during a severe frost, " when the mean noonday temperature
was 28°-5 F., that of the sewage pumped and effluent water was 43° F."

(Report III. p. 176.)

    The Fourth Eeport gave the results of the observations carried on from
March 25, 1871, to March 24, 1872, both days inclusive ; and gave a more

special account of the analyses of the sewage and effluent water during thnt

--period. The analyses were made of average snniplcp. that is to say, of

samples taken in proportion to the rate of flow of the sewage at the times as
iiidicntcd by the gaugings.

448 REPORT--1873.

The general results were :

              Sewage from the town                                                     416,787 tons.
                Effluent water returned to the tanks ....                               52,466 ,,
Therefore Diluted sewage
Of which, Amount utilized                                                              469,253
              Amount merely filtered                                                   385,291

                                                                                         83,962

   As to the composition of the sewage and effluent water, the average amount
of nitrogen for 100,000 tons in the diluted sewage pumped was 5-529 tons

that in the effluent water 1-147.

     As the total amoimt of diluted sewage was . . . 380,277 tons,

     And the total effluent water                                                                        195,536 ,,

it follows that " the proportion of nitrogen escaping in the effluent water to

the total quantity applied is therefore -1067, or about one tenth."

  An estimate was also made of the amount of nitrogen recovered in the

crops ; the general result of the whole being that of 100 parts of nitrogen in

--the sewage pumped, 42 were recovered in the crops, 11 lost in the effluent

water, and 47 not accounted for that is to say, remaining in the soil or esca-

ping into deeper subsoil-waters. (See accompanying Report.)

Some experiments were also made with the view of inquiring into the pos-

sibility of the distribution of entozoic disease by means of sewage-irrigation.

Some " slime and mud " from the bottom and sides of carriers at Earlswood

Farm was examined by Mr. M. C. Cooke, who found that it contained life of

various kinds, especially Annelida, but did not detect any entozoic larvae.

The existence of this slime at the bottom of the carriers here was attributed
by the Committee " to the fact that the subsoil is kept in a saturated condition
by the want of underdraiuing ; " and they were of opinion " that when land is

thus saturated with sewage, certain atmospheric conditions exist which may be

attended by malaria more or less injurious to health." (lloport III. p. 182.)

Dr. Cobbold was requested by the Committee to examine, in conjunction

with Professor Marshall and the writer, the carcass of an ox fed for two years

on sewage-grown grass. It was found to be, as he reports, free from internal

parasites of any kind. All the viscera, together with portions of numerous
muscles, " with their associated areolar and aponeurotic coverings," were

carefully examined. He observed that the conditions were favourable to this

result, inasmuch as (1) the grass &c. was ciit and cari-ied, and the animal was

not  grazed  on  the farm                            (2)  the  soil  is very porous ;  (3)               mollusca,                 so  often  the

found (a species  of Limncea)                             contained     no  cercarian                    larvaa                    (5) the " flaky
                                                                                                                                ;

vegetable tufts '' collected from the sides of the furrows contained " numerous

active free Nematodes, but no ova of any true entozoon ; (6) the sewage pro-
bably contained sufficient alcohol to destroy the larvae. The Committee agreed

with all these observations except the last.

The absence of mollusca is most remarkable, and with it must be associ-

ated the observations recorded by the Committee of the destruction of wire-
worms &c. by the sewage. Thus a crop of American oats was seriously

damaged and in danger of being destroyed by the ravages of the Oscinis vas-

tator, one of the smallest but most destructive of those grubs and wireworms

which at times cause such injury to cereal crops in this country. Two heavy

dressings of sewage were applied to this bed daring two successive days, the

result being that the grubs were entirely destroyed and the greater part of

the crop saved. (Report II, p. 65.)
             ON THE TREATMENT AND UTILIZATION OF SEWAGE.            449

    Again, at Toubridge Wells " it was stated that a large field of turnips,
being infested with the fly, was flooded with sewage, which drowned the fly
and saved the crop, which is expected to turn out well but rather late."

    So far, then, as actual facts at present show, " there is no evidence that
entozoal forms of life are to be found on the farm at all in any stage of their
existence, or in the flesh of an animal fed exclusively for 22 months on sewaged
produce grown on the farm." (Eeport III. p. 189.) As far as the sani-
tary influence of sewage-farming is concerned, the Committee have retiu'ns
from eight places where it is at work. In no instance has any disease what-

ever been traced, either among the labourers on the farm or among the inha-
bitants in the vicinity, or among the cattle, to the sewage-farm. In two

instances it is reported that the health of the neighbourhood has improved,

and in several that the land has very much improved in value, and the pro-
duction of crops is much more certain. The note from Aldershot is, " Sani-
tary state of Camp and Barracks vastly improved. The land produces fair

crops under sewage, which before produced nothing whatever."

             Conclusions arrlvbd at by the Committee.

I. All conservancy plans, including midden-heap and cesspool systems,

dry ash- and dry earth-closets, pail-closets, &c., are quite incompetent as so-

lutions of the general question of the removal of the refuse matters of a

population.

   Such plans deal with only a small part of the liquid manure ; towns which
resort to one of them require, therefore, to be sewered, and the sewage re-

quires to be piu'ified.

The manure produced is in all cases (except in that of simple pails or tubs

where no extraneous materials are added) poor, and will only bear the cost

of carriage to a short distance, taking into consideration the cost of collection.

That produced by the dry earth system is, even after the earth has been used

four times over, but little better than a good garden-mould. Such plans,

moreover, all violate one of the most important of sanitary laws, which is

that all refuse matters which are liable to become injurious to health

should be removed instantly and be dealt with afterwards. With all

these plans it is an obvious advantage on the score of economy to keep

the refuse about the premises as long as possible ; and the use of deodorants

of various sorts, or even of disinfectants, proves that this is the case, and that

these systems all depend upon a fallacious principle. They should therefore

be discouraged as much as possible, and only resorted to as temporary expe-

dients, or with small populations under exceptional circumstances.

II. The water-carriage system, on the other hand, is based upon a sound

principle, that of removing all the refuse matters at once, and in the cheapest

possible manner, by gravitation, and ought to be resorted to in all but the

most exceptional cases.

The opinion of the Committee, that all sewers should be made of impervious

materials, and that separate drains to dry the subsoil should be constructed

where necessary, has already been most emphatically expressed.

The freest possible ventilation of sewers, house- drains, and soil-pipes, in

order to prevent accumulations of foul air, is also essential.

With regard to the utilization of sewage, the Committee has come to the

conclusion that the precipitation-processes that it has examined are all in-

1873.                                                           2G

competent, and necessarily so, to effect more than a separation of a small part
of the valuable ingredients of sewage, and that only a partial purification is
effected by them. Some of them may, however, be useful as methods of
effecting a more rapid and complete separation of the sewage-sludge.

   The upward-filtration process only effects a clarification of the sewage, and

is therefore no solution of the question.
    Weare's charcoal-filtration process, as carried on at Stoke-upon -Trent

Workhouse, did not give satisfactory results, the effluent water being in effect
weak sewage ; an opportunity will, however, soon be given for an examina-

tion of this process in a modified form on a much larger scale at Bradford,

and under more favourable conditions.
   Intermittent downward filtration through soil has been shown at Merthyr

Tydfil to afford a means of purifying the sewage under favourable conditions
but it cannot be said to be a method of utilization except to a very partial
extent, as the investigations made by the Committee showed that the effluent
water contained as much nitrogen as was originally in solution in the sewage,
but mainly as nitric acid instead of as ammonia and organic nitrogen. _ There
can be no doubt that the process would prove useful as an adjunct to irrigation,
or where a sufficient amount of laud for irrigation cannot conveniently be got.

   By properly conducted sewage-irrigation a solution is afforded to the ques-

tion of sewage utilization ; it has already been stated that a precipitation-

process, or some clarifying process, may be found useful. If such process,

however, removes the phosphates from the sewage, it wiU, if employed for
irrigation, require to be supplemented either by the use of the precipitate
produced in the settling-tanks, or by that of some other manure supplying

phosphoric acid.
    In all instances it is essential that the land should be well underdrained,

and that the sewage should all pass through the soil and not merely over it
otherwise, as has been shown, it will only occasionally be satisfactorily

purified.

    The catchwater, or, as the Committee has termed it, the supersaturation
principle, is not defensible either on agricultural, chemical, or sanitary

 principles.

   An irrigation-farm should therefore carry out intermittent downward fil-

tration on a large scale, so that the sewage may be always thoroughly puri-
fied, while at the same time the maximum of utilization is obtained.

    It is certain that all kinds of crops may be grown with sewage, so that the

 farmer can grow such as he can best seU ; nevertheless, the staple crops must
 be cattle-food, such as grass, roots &c., with occasional crops of kitchen vege-

 tables and of corn.

    And it is also certain, from the analysis of the soil, that it becomes very
 much richer under sewage-irrigation, and that some of the manurial consti-

 tuents of the sewage accumulate in it.
     Cattle should be fed on the farm. The result would be a vast increase in

 the production of meat and milk, the great desiderata of the populations pro-

  ducing the sewage.

     Thus the system of farming must be specialized and capital concentrated,
  the absence of which conditions has proved a great barrier to the satisfactory
  practical solution of the sewage question.

     The Committee has not been able to trace any ill effects to the health of
  the persons living around sewage-farms, even when badly conducted ; nor is
  there any proof whatever that vegetables grown thereon are in any way in-

  ferior to those grown with other manure. On the contrary, there is plenty
ON THE BRADFORD WATERWORKS.  451

of evidence that auch vegetables are perfectly suited for the food of man and

beast, and that the milk given by cows fed on sewaged grass is perfectly
wholesome. To give a i-ecent example, Mr. Dyke, Medical Officer of Health
of Merthyr Tydfil, states that since the abundant supply of milk from the
cows fed on irrigated grass the children's mortality has decreased from 48,
50, and 52 per cent, of the total deaths to only 39 per cent., and that, so far
from diarrhoea having been made more prevalent by the use of sewaged cab-
bages, " last year the Eegistrar-General called attention to the fact that
diarrhoea was less prevalent in Merthyr than in any place in England and
Wales ;" and he expressed hisbeKef in " the perfect salubrity of the vegetable
food so grown."

   With regard to the assumption which has been made that entozoic diseases
would be propagated by irrigation, all the evidence that the Committee has
been able to collect, and more especially the positive facts obtained by expe-
riments, are against such an idea ; and the Committee is of opinion that such
diseases will certainly not be more readily propagated by sewage-irrigation
than by the use of human refuse as manure in any other way, and probably

less if the precaution be taken of not allowing the animals to graze, but always
having the grass cut and carried to them.

Report of the Committee for superintending the Monthly Reports of the

   Progress of Chemistry, consisting of Professor A. W. Williamson,

   F.R.S., Professor Frankland, F.R.S., and Professor Roscoe,

    F.R.S.

The Committee have much pleasure in reporting that, during this third

year of their publication, the monthly reports of the progress of chemistry
have given satisfactory evidence of increasing usefulness. Not only has
their circulation in tHs country and abroad increased, but there is every
reason to believe that they supply an important want to the progress of
chemistry in this country, and will conduce to the advancement of the

science.

thus bringing to a focus the rays of light which emanate from the various

   On the Bradford Waterworks. By Charles Gott, M.Inst.C.E.

       [A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso.']

In 1854 the " Bradford Corporation Waterworks Act " was passed. Under
the power of this Act the Corporation purchased all the existing works, and
were charged with the duty of providing the supply of water for the borough
and surrounding districts.

   At this time the old works supplied about half a million gallons of waterper

diem, a quantity altogether inadequate for the necessities of the inhabitants.

                                                                 2g2

--452 REPORT 1873.

   After obtaining their powers the Corporation put them into operation at
once, and commenced the construction of the large system of works from
which the town is now supplied.

   Some of the reservoirs, conduits, and other works which are to form parts
of the same system are not yet completed.

   All the Bradford waterworks are gravitation works ; there are no pumping-
engines or other means employed for raising water from streams or wells.
The water is collected at siich levels that it can be conveyed directly into the
reservoirs for storage and supply. The sources of supply which are available
are therefore more limited in extent than would be the case if the water was
lifted from some lower level ; but, on the other hand, the water is more free
from pollution and is softer and of better quality.

   No filtering of any kind is required ; the water is supplied directly from

the reservoirs into the distributing mains. The reservoirs act as subsiding
reservoirs, and are found to be quite sufficient to render the water clean and

bright.

   The district of supply of the Bradford Waterworks is not confined to the
borough, but includes thirty-four of the surrounding towns and places, viz. :

Addingham.          Heaton.
Adwalton,           Hundsworth.

Allerton.           Idle.
Apperley.           Liversedge.
Bingley.
Birstal.            Morton.
Burnsal.            North Bierley.

Clayton.            Queensbury.
Cleckheaton.
                    Saltaire.
Denholme.           Shelf.
Draughton.          Shipley.
                    Silsden.
Driglinton.
Eccleshill.         Thornton.
Parsley.            Tong.
Gildersome.         Wike.
Gomersal.           Wilsdcn.
                    Windhill.

With an aggregate population at the present time of not less than 280,000.
   The levels of the district of supply vary greatly, viz. from 200 feet

above the sea at Apperley to 1200 feet above the sea at Queensbury, making
a diiference of 1000 feet of elevation to be covered by the distribution of the
water. The supply is given in two separate services, called the high-level
service and the low-level service, the high-level service being again divided
and served by separate mains. All the places at a lower elevation than 500
feet above the sea are included in the low-level, and all the places above that
height are included in the high-level service. The pressure of water in some
of the distributing mains rises to upwards of 200 lbs. on the square inch.

   The sources of supply for the low-level service lie to the north of Bradford
in the valleys of the rivers Aire and Wharfe ; various streams and tributaries
of these rivers are taken into the reservoirs and conduits. The principal
streams taken are the Sand-bed beck, Halton-gill beck, Joy beck. Berry-
ground beck, Gill beck, Howgill beck, Barden beck, Hethness GiU, and the
Marchup beck in the valley of the river Wharfe, and the Fish beck, Holden

beck, Swartha beck, Clougb beck, Spinner beck, and the Judith-Cliflfe beck
in the valley of the river Aire. These streams receive the water from a
drainage area of 9770 acres, 7550 acres being in the Wharfe valley, and
2220 acres in the Aire valley.

    The average rainfall on these gathering-grounds is about 36 inches per
annum.

    There is no storage reservoir in the valley of the river Aire, so that that

part of the gathering-ground cannot at present be fully utilized ; the daily
flow of the streams only can be taken, and none of the winter flow can be

collected for summer use.
   In the vaUey of the Wharfe there are two storage reservoirs, viz. the Barden

reservoir and the Chelker reservoir.
    The sources of supply for the high-level service lie to the west of Bradford

in the valleys of the Denholme beck and the river Worth, both tributaries of

the river Aire.

   The principal streams taken are the Stubdeu beck and the Foreside beck
in the Denhobne vaUey, and the Bond Clough, Rag-Clough beck, Greenholes
Clough, Hardnese Clough, Deep Dyke, Paul Clough, Sun-Hill Clough,

Nan Scar beck, Holden Clough, Harden Clough, Stoney-HiU Clough, and
Foster Dyke iu the valley of the river Worth. None of the works in the
Worth valley have been completed yet ; up to the present time the high-level

supply has been drawn entirely from the Stubden and Foreside becks. The
drainage-area of these streams is 2700 acres, viz. 900 acres iu the Denholme
valley, and 1800 acres in the Worth valley.

   The average rainfall is about 42 inches per annum, and the lowest level at
which water is taken for supply is 1030 feet above the sea.

   Nearly the whole of the gathering-grounds from which the water for supjily
is drawn are high moor lands, above the reach of any pollution from populated
districts ; they range in elevation from 600 feet to 1475 feet above the level

of the sea.

   The total acreage of the drainage-area exclusively appropriated for the
supply of the town is 13,000 acres, viz. :

Wharfe valley          Low Level.            9,770

Aire valley                         7550     2,700

   The water collected from these sources is conveyed to the town by means
of covered stone conduits and large iron pipes. The length of the conduit
from the Heaton-service reservoir at Bradford to tlie Barden reservoir is
18 miles, and from the Barden reservoir to the Sand-bed beck at Burnsal,
the most distant stream taken to the north, 4 miles. The length of the iron

is 5 miles, and of the conduit from the Stubden reservoir to the Bond Clough
at Haworth, the most distant stream taken to the west, 4 miles.

   The whole of the works so far mentioned are exclusively for collecting and

supplying water for the use of the towns.

   Other reservoirs with separate drainage-areas have been made for collecting
and supplying compensation water to the various mills and streams which are

--affected by the taking of the town supply viz. the Gumwith reservoir at

Hartlington for giving compensation water for that which is taken from the
streams in the valley of the river Wharfe, the SUsden reservoir at Silsden for

the low-level works in the valley of the river Aire, the Hewenden reservoir at
Hewenden for the old supply of the Many "Wells spring, the Doe-Park reservoir
at Denholme for the high-level works in the Denholme valley, and the Leeming
and Leeshaw reservoirs at Oxenhope (now in course of construction) for the
streams to be taken in the vaUey of the river "Worth.

   The extent, capacity, &c. of the several reservoirs are as follows, viz. :

are completed, is ten millions of gallons per day, a quantity equal to 36 gallons
per head for the population of the district of supply.
· The sources of supply of these works would, however, if fully developed,
yield more water than the quantity named ; 700 acres of gathering-ground,
on which there is a rainfall of 44 inches per annum, will yield one million
gallons of water per day if a reservoir is made to contain 180 days' supply.
With a rainfall of 36 inches per annum, the drainage-area would require to
be about 900 acres to give the same quantity of water per day. The quantity
of water to be impounded, 180 days' supply, 180,000,000 gallons, is equal
to 11-4 inches in depth on 700 acres, and to 8-805 inches in depth on 900
acres, about one fourth of the total rainfall in each case. These quantities

may vary, however, to some extent with the character of the gathering-

ground ; sometimes it happens that there are large springs within the drainage-

area, whilst in other cases the ground may be so absorbent that part of the
water may pass down to springs below the level of the works.

   The supply is also dependent upon the distribution of rain throughout the
year ; if the rain falls in heavy floods with a long period of drought, so much
of the fall cannot be utilized as during years when the rain is more equally

distributed.

    In determining the value of any given area of gathering-ground after the
average rainfall is ascertained, one fourth is to be taken off to arrive at the
quantity for dry and exceptional years, one third of the remaining quantity
is then to be deducted for loss by evaporation, absorption, discoloured and
turbid water, and unmanageable floods. These quantities show that only one
half of the total average rainfall can be collected and used. These quantities
and particulars, however, apply only to gravitation works in districts similar
to those in which the Bradford works are situated.

    The Bradford reservoirs are formed in the manner usually adopted for large
works i. e, by embankments made across the valleys, such sites being almost
the only practicable ones where reservoirs could be made of sufficient size

for the large quantities of water to be collected.

    The mode of construction adopted for such reservoirs is to make the em-
bankments of earthwork, the earth being excavated from the site of the
reservoir itself. In the middle of the embankment a vertical core or wall of
puddle is made, to render it impervious. This puddle-core must be continued
to such a depth that the water cannot pass uuder it ; and it must also be
contiaued so far into the sides of the hills which form the valley, that the

water cannot pass round the ends.
    The strata underlying the site of the reservoir are not always regular ; in

some cases the bottoms of the valleys have been raised by drift many feet in
thickness. It is necessary to find some stratum or some number of strata
which together wUl make an impervious bottom, and which underlie nearly
the whole of the site, and to continue the puddle-work of the embankment
(by means of open-cut trenches) into them, so as to form a complete basin or

inclosure within which the water is to be contained.
     It is necessary in some cases to continue the puddle-trenches from the ends

 of the embankment up the sides of the valley to some point where the dip of

 the measures brings the impervious stratum to the height required for the

 surface of the water when the reservoir is full : advantage is also to be taken

 of faults and dislocations in the natural strata ; in this district these faults
 are nearly always impervious, and they are sometimes of great service in

 reservoir works.

     In making the deep trenches for the puddle-work, it frequently happens
                    ;

--456 REPORT 1873.

that springs of water are met with, and great difficulties are sometimes
experienced in dealing with them. If the springs run in from the sides of
the trench at a level above the stratum on which the puddle is to rest, they
do not constitiite any permanent difficulty ; the water may be pumped out of

the trench whilst the work is in progress, and may be gradually turned back

with the puddle, which is put into the trench as the work proceeds. If,
however, a spring rises from the bottom of the trench, it cannot be disposed
of in that way. It must be built round in some safe manner by concrete or
stonework and collected, so that it can be brought up in an iron pipe in the
work, or conveyed to one end of the puddle-trench and discharged at the
surface of the ground clear of the embankment. Springs in the ground which
is to form the bottom of the reservoir do not indicate that the site is not a
good one, but generally the contrary; and they sometimes show where the
embankment can be placed with the greatest advantage.

   The existence of the springs may show that there is some impervious

material lying across the valley somewhere below the line along which they
issue ; and on this impervious material, and below the springs, it is probable

the embankment may be most easily formed : at any rate, the springs show

the line immediately above which it would not be desirable to place the
embankment.

   The works for admitting streams into reservoirs are of several kinds. In
cases where the whole stream is taken, a pool or lodge is made by a dam
placed across the stream at the head of the reservoir. This dam arrests the
flow of the stream, and gives time for any solid matter carried on by the
water to fall, and to a great extent saves the reservoir from being silted up
the solid deposit is caught in the lodge, from which it can be easily removed.
The size of the lodge can be regulated to suit the character and requirements

of each case.
   In cases where turbid or coloured water is not to be taken, side channels

for carrying floods past the reservoirs must be made ; and the usual mode of
admitting the streams is by what are called leaping-weirs. This contrivance
consists of a weir built across the stream, to stop the water and cause the
water to flow over the conduit which is intended to receive it and carry it to
the reservoir. The conduit intended to receive the water is built across the
stream inside the weir, and a long narrow opening is made through the crest
of the weir along the top of the conduit. The weir on one side of this
opetaing is made a step lower than it is on the other side, and the stream in

passing has to fall down this step. When the quantity of the stream is small,

it will run close over the edge of the step and fall through the narrow opening
into the conduit below ; but when the stream is swoUen and large, it will run
with greater velocity, and will leap from the toj) of the step over the opening
and pass away down its original course.

   The size of the opening can be adjusted so as to take any given quantity of
water required from the stream. It is self-acting, so far as regards the
passing of dangerous floods ; but it is not altogether so, so far as the rejection
of turbid water is concerned. It does, however, make a selection of water to
some extent, as it usuaUj' happens that when the water is most turbid and
during sudden storms, the streams would be so much increased that they
would overleap the opening through the weir, and so pass ofl' without entering

the works.

   Another mode of taking in streams and obtaining only clean water from

them, is to construct a filtering-conduit under the bed of the stream to receive
the water before it is admitted into the reservoir. These filtering-conduits
ON THE BKADFORU WATERWORKS.  457

 are formed by making an ordinary brick or stone channel a few feet below
 the level at which the stream is to be received. The channel is in section of

Uthe shape of a letter ; over the top open grating or stonework is placed, in

 snch a manner as to allow water to flow freely through it. The ground at
 the sides of the channel is made solid and impervious up to the level of the
 side walls. Over the channel, and for any convenient breadth on both sides
 of it, broken stone, gravel, or other filtering media are placed, through which

the water has to run before it can find its way into the conduit. In this way

any solid matter can be caught and separated from the water, and the water
can be obtained in the reservoir fit for immediate use. The water in the

reservoir is not liable to be discoloured by any sudden flow of turbid water
during heavy rains or thunder-storms, as the excess of water beyond the
quantity which can pass through the filter will flow oif down the side and
waste channels made for the purpose.

    This mode of admitting water to conduits and reservoirs is entirely self-

acting, does not require attention during storms, and the dirt on the filters
will be carried away by floods or can be easily removed.

    The works for drawing water out of reservoirs are not without difficulties

of their pecuUar Idnd. The mode usually adopted is to make a tunnel or
culvert through the embankment at the lowest level at which the water is
required to be drawn ; and at the middle of this culvert, but a little within

the puddle-core, to erect a strong shaft or well in which to place the valves
for di-awing off' the water. The rods and apparatus for opening and shutting
these valves are taken up the shaft to the top of the embankment. This mode

of construction is attended with many difficulties, and often leads to breakage

of the work, and to consequent leakage of water from the reservoir. This
breakage arises from unequal settlement ; for if the foundations of the shaft
are made rigid and secure, the shaft itself stands, whilst the tunnel or culvert
on both sides of it cannot be kept so rigidly in position, and fractures conse-
quently take place, generally on both sides of the vertical shaft. The settle-
nient under the embankment is also necessarily unequal, the middle and

highest part being much heavier than the inner and outer parts. The
settlement of the embankment is often both vertical and lateral, on account
of the spreading of the foundation work of the embankment, which some-
times tears the masonry asunder, and so increases the injury caused by
the unequal settlement round the vertical valve-shaft. To avoid these
difficulties, the tunnel or culvert is now frequently made in the solid ground
at the side of the vaUey, some distance from the middle of the embankment,

and where the distui'bance caused by the unequal settlement is not likely

to reach.

   When the water is drawn through these valves in the midst of the embank-

ment, great vibration is caused by the force of the water passing out. This
vibration is liable to increase the settlement of the heavier parts of the em-
bankment for some considerable distance round the outlet works, especially

when the substrata are of a compressible character, and may cause settlement
of the work which would not otherwise occur.

   These difficulties have been pronded against in some of the later Bradford
waterworks by placing the outlet valves at the outside of the embankment,
and conveying the water tlirough the outer half of the culvert in an iron
pipe. The vertical valve-shaft for the rods and apparatus for opening the
valves are by this means rendered unnecessary, and the unequal settlement
and injury caused by vibration arc altogether avoided. This mode of con-

struction has so far been found to work with advantage ; the valve and outlet
--458
REPORT 1873.

works are easily accessible for examination and repair, and are less costly

than the mode previously described.
    Overflow and waste channels also require special attention in their con-

struction, on account of the difficulty which is sometimes experienced of

passing flood-water from sudden and unusual storms.
   The great height from which the water has to be conveyed renders it diffi-

cult to deal with. The water has to be received above the reservoir, and
conveyed down to the stream in the valley below, a height in some cases
exceeding 100 feet. During this fall it attains considerable velocity, and

passes with great force.

   The mode of construction which has been adopted in some cases is to form
the waste channel in such a way that the water shall be let down by a series
of short vertical falls, the bottom of the channel being so made as to give no
increase of velocity to the water as it flows along. These falls are formed by
walls buUt across the bottom of the channel, circular or otherwise, on plan, the

--tops of the walls being in every case higher than the bottom of the channel the

efl"ect of these walls being that the velocity acquired by the water in passing
one fall is not continued and increased at the next, the water held back by
the wall forming a pool, which simply overflows at the fall next below.
These pools have the further efl'ect of protecting the stonework of the bottom
of the channel from the force of the water falling upon it, and the water is

made to receive its own force when passing along the work.
    The importance and value to Bradford of a supply of soft water is very

great, a large proportion of the water being used far trade purposes, for

washing wool, and for dyeing, &c., for which hard water would be of much

less value.

    The town has had the benefit of a constant service at high pressure for
some years past, and has become rather exacting and particular.

    The intermittent supply of many large towns would be altogether unsatis-

factory here, after the constant supply under high pressure to which the

inhabitants have become accustomed.

   A new use of water is gradually being introduced. The water is being

taken direct from the street mains, and employed for working water-pressure
 engines. These engines are becoming numerous, and are likely to be exten-

sively used for working warehouse cranes, and for many other purposes where
 only light work is required. They appear to have many advantages as com-

 pared with steam, where one or two horse-power at most is wanted : they
 are always ready for work, they require no special buildings or furnaces,
 they can be readily applied in any premises without structural alterations
 and without increasing the danger from fire, and are very simple and easy

 to work.

    The prices at which water is sold for trade are very low. It is sold by
 measure ; and the prices range from Is. down to 2cl. per 1000 gallons.

    The value of the waterworks to the town has been very great. The trade
 of the district could not have been developed to the same extent^ without
 them, and the whole of the property of the town is increased in value

 by them.
ON INSTEUCTION IN ELEMENTARY GEOMETllY.  459

Report of the Committee appointed to consider the possibility of Improv-
   ing the Methods of Instruction in Elementary Geometry, the
    Committee consisting of Professor Sylvester, Professor Cayley,

   Professor Hirst, Rev. Professor Bartholomew Price, Professor
   H. J. S. Smith, Dr. Spottiswoode, Mr. R. B. Hayward, Dr.
   Salmon, Rev. R. Town send. Professor Fuller, Professor Kelland,
   Mr. J. M.Wilson, awf? Professor Clifford [Secretary).

Until recently the instruction 'm elementary geometry given in this country
was exclusively based upon Simson's modification of the text of Euclid. Of
late years, however, attempts have been made to introduce other text-books,
agreeing with the ancient elements in general plan, but differing from it in
some important details of treatment. And, in particular, the Association for
the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching having considered the whole
question with great labour and deliberation, is engaged in the construction of
a syllabus, part of which is already completed. The Committee had thus to

consider, ^rs<, the question of the plurality of text-books; secondly, certain

general principles on which deviation from the ancient standard has been
recommended; and, thirdly, the SyUabus of the Geometrical Association.

                              1. On the Plurality of Text-BooTcs.

    It has already been found that the practical difficulty of examination stands

in the way of allowing to the geometrical teacher complete freedom in the
methods of demonstration and in the order of the'propositions. The difficulty
of demonstrating a proposition depends upon the number of assumptions which
it is allowable to start from ; and this depends upon the order in which the
subject has been presented. When different text-books have been used, it
thus becomes virtually impossible to set the same papers to aU the candidates ;

and in this country at present teaching is guided so largely by the require-
ments of examinations, that this circumstance opposes a serious barrier to in-

dividual attempts at improvement. On the other hand, the Committee think

that no single text-book which has yet been produced is fit to succeed Euclid
in the position of authority ; and it does not seem probable that a good book
 could be written by the joint action of selected individuals. It therefore
 seems advisable that the requisite uniformity and no more shoidd be obtained
by the publication of an authorized Syllabus, indicating the order of the pro-
 positions, and in some cases the general character of the demonstrations, but
leaving the choice of the text-book perfectly free to the teacher ; and the
Committee believe that the authorization of such a syllabus might properly

come from the British Association.

                          2. On some Principles of Improvement.

   The Committee recommend that the teaching of Practical Geometry shoxild
precede that of Theoretical Geometry, in order that the mind of the learner
may first be familiarized with the facts of the science, and afterwards led to
see their connexion. With this end the construction in practical geometry
should be directed as much to the verification of theorems as to the solution

of problems.

  --It has been proposed to introduce what are called redundant axioms that

is to say, assumptions whose truth is apparently obvious, but which are not
460 REPORT-- 1873.

independent of one another. For example, if the two assumptions were made
that two straight lines cannot enclose a space, and that a straight line is the
shortest distance between any two of its points. It appears to the Committee

that it is not advisable to introduce redundant axioms, but that all the as-

sumptions made should be necessary for demonstration of the propositions
and independent of one another.

   It appears that the Principle of Superposition might advantageously be em-
ployed with greater frequency in the demonstrations, and that an explicit
recognition of it as an axiom or fundamental assumption should be made at
the commencement.

   The Committee think also that it would be advisable to introduce explicitly
certain definitions and principles of general logic, in order that the processes

of simple conversion may not be confounded with geometrical methods.

                       3. The Syllabus of the Geometrical Association.
   The Association for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching has issued
(privately) a syllabus covering the ground of the first three books of Euclid
and the doctrine of proportionals. The Committee are of opinion that this
Syllabus is decidedly good so far as it goes, but they do not wish to make a
detailed report upon it in its present incomplete state. AVhen it is finished,
however, they will be prepared to report fuUy upon the merit of its several

parts, to make such suggestions for revision as may appear necessaiy, and to

discuss the advisability of giving to it the authority of the British Association.

For this purpose the Committee request that they may be reappointed.

Interim Report of the Committee apjjoiiited for the purpose of making
  Experiments on Instruments for Measuring the Speed of Ships, ^-c.

Your Committee have to report that, owing to the various engagements of

the members, it has been possible to hold only one meeting during the past
twelve months.

   At this meeting it was resolved to request the loan of instruments of
each of the pressure and other logs to be experimented with, and also to
endeavour to obtain the use of a vessel whereon to carry out the expe-

riments.

   Your Committee have much pleasure in stating that three instruments
have now been kindly placed at their disposal, as well as a steam-launch

for conducting the experiments.

   Your Committee, if reappointed, trust that some actual results may be

anticipated during the next twelve months.

   No expense has been incurred, and no part of the grant of .£50 has

been drawn.

DETERMINATION OF HIGH TEMPERATURES BY REFRACTED RAYS. 461

Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. Crum Brown, Mr. J.
  Dewar, Dr. Gladstone, Prof. A. W. Williamson, Sir W. Thom-

   son, and Prof. Tait, appointed for the purpose of Determinating
   High Temperatures by means of the Refrangibility of the Light

   evolved by Fluid or Solid Substances. Drawn up by James De-

   war, Reporter.

It is well known that as the temperature of a solid is gradually increased,

the refrangibility of the emitted light increases likewise ; and as the result

we find red light emitted first, and gradually the other coloured rays appear
until we reach the ultra-violet rays. This correlation between refrangibility
and temperature was first experimentaUy proved by Draper* ; and it would

be a result of great importance to determine accurately the law of growth

of refrangibility with temperature. If this could be achieved, a very

easily applied and accurate pyrometer could be made of the ordinary spec-

troscope.

   There are various difiiculties, however, that beset this investigation at the

outset. First of all, the rapid gi'owth of the new rays confines the observa-

tions Avithin narrow limits of temperature                                                                                                                                                                                             secondly, the want of equal
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

sensibility of the eye for rays of all wave-lengths ; and, thirdly, the inter-

ference of diffused light preventing exact definition. It thus appears to be

futile to attempt or even expect accurate observations in these circumstances

through registration by the human eye, although, on first considering the

subject, it appears to be a very easy matter. Pinding no means of overcoming

these difficulties, unless by the use of complicated apparatus, involving the

use of rock-crystal prisms and lenses or fine gratings and the employment of

photographic registration, requiring time and thought previous to execution,
a series of observations have been made in the mean time on the increase of

radiation with temperature, an inquiry of vital importance with regard to

this subject.

   Becquerel, in his treatise on Light called ' La Lumiere,' has detailed a great
number of observations on the growth of luminous intensity with increasing
temperature. From these experiments he infers that " the difi'erences between

the logarithms of the luminous intensities are proportional to the differences

of temperature," proving that an exponential function of the form

               I=«(e*(T-e)_l),

where I is the luminous intensity, T the temperature of the body, Q the tem-

perature at which the special ray begins to be evolved, a and h constants, and
c the base of the logarithms adopted. The values of a and 6, as deduced from
the experiment, for the red ray are respectively 0-00743 and 0-005014. The

above formula gives equally the growth of total luminous intensity if we take
   as 500° C, that point at which the light-rays begin to be evolved, and a and

h as now having the respective values of 12053 and 0-00764. From the

last formula Becquerel gives the following values of the total luminous in-

tensity of a solid substance at different temperatures, stating it is probable
the above law does not hold above 1200° C. :

ported by means of a platinum wire in the flame of a good Bunsen burner,

--464 REPORT 1873.

mass at near the temperature required. This latter fact was ascertained by
finding the amount of heat the platinum emitted when thrown into a calori-
meter containing a known quantity of water. As the amount of heat emitted
was very small, special precautions had to be taken in guarding the calorimeter
and in getting the mass of platinum transferred. The calorimeter, containing
about 100 grammes of water, was floated in a cistern (having been pre-
viously placed in the middle of a tin cylinder, leaving an annular space
between), and so loaded that the water in the calorimeter was sunk to the
level of the water in the cistern. The Buusen burner was placed in a tin
vessel loaded with shot, so as to give a flame the upper half of which was
above the level of the water in the cistern. By this means constancy of
temperature was maintained, and the results agreed closely together. It is
easy to be convinced that a mass of platinum like that employed, radiating
freely, is rarely heated above a temperature of 1100° or 1200° C. Compa-
risons were made between platinum in the Bunsen burner and lime in the
oxyhydi'ogen flame, and also between lime in both.

   The photometer employed for comparing the lights was on the principle of

Athat recommended by Bunsen, wooden box, about 8 inches long, 4 inches

broad, and 3 inches deep, containing several diaphragms with circular aper-
tures, thoroughly blackened in the interior, and ha\'ing the aperture of the middle
diaphragm covered with a piece of Swedish filter-paper, marked with one or
two circular spots of paraffin, was employed to exclude extraneous light and

to obtain good definition. By this means it is possible to obliterate com-

pletely the spot of paraffin, and thus gain greater confidence in the results.

   From the mean of a great number of experiments made in this way, the
luminous intensity at about 2000° C. is from 500 to 550 times that at 1040° C.
The calculated amount given by the above formula for the exact temperature
of 2000° C. is 484 times that at the lower temperature. According to the
formula of Becquerel, it would be about 24,000,000 times that at the lower

temperature. This empirical law, therefore, gives with considerable approxi-

--mation the luminous intensity up to a temperature of 2000° C.
    Total Radiation. If the law of Dulong and Petit for the velocity of cooling
was true for temperatures above the range of the actual observations made in
support of the law, the amount of heat radiated per unit of time would be
found by multiplying the velocity of cooling at the temperature considered
into the specific heat at that temperature and into the weight of the substance.

From this may also be calculated the amount radiated per unit of surface.

In fact, for the same substance the relative quantities of heat evolved at two
difl'erent temperatures would be to each other as the velocities of cooling if
the specific heat and the emissive power remained constant. This would give
an extraordinarily rapid rate to the growth of total radiation. For instance,

taking the temperatures of 2000° C. and 700° C, we find, according to Dulong

and Petit's law,

                             Q^--for-« -^l,54o,

where a is the constant 1'0077.
   Thus a substance radiates at a temperature of 2000° C. 21,000 times as

much heat per unit of time as it does at a temperature of 700° C.
   In order to compare the total radiation as given from the law of Dulong

and Petit with that of actual experiment, a series of observations were made,
and the total heat evolved registered by the use of Pouillet's pyrheHometer.
For this purpose, a spherical ball of lime, 8 millims. in diameter, was formed
DETERMINATION OV HIGH TEMPERATURES BY REFRACTED RAYS. 465

by careful filing and polishing on the end of a narrow pencil of the same
substance. This little knob of lime was then gradually heated, carefuUy
turning it round, up to incipient fusion in the oxyhydrogen flame, so as to
allow contraction to take place. With care in this way, it is possible to get
a very uniform sphere having a surface of about one square centimetre. The
pyrheliometer was filled with bisulphide of carbon, for the purpose of
registering minute alterations of temperature. The experiments were made
at two distinct temperatures, viz. at a low visible red heat and at the

maximum temperature of the oxyhydrogen flame. The mean of these

experiments has given, for radiation per square centimetre per minute
at about 700° C, from 20 to 25 gramme-units per minute, and at 2000° C.

--maximum temperature from 2000 to 2500 gramme-units the ratio of the

amounts being as 1 to 100, very difi'erent from the calculated result. The
law of Dulong and Petit, therefore, gives a far too rapid increase for the total
radiation ; and if we assume the law to be true in order to define temperature,

the results arrived at are always too low.

   If the total amount of radiation at different temperatures is tabulated,
using a thermoelectric pile and an apparatus similar to the one employed for

light-intensities, it is found that the curve of increase may be very accurately
represented by a parabolic curve. The empirical formula of this curve is

                        580° + »3 X 46° = «^E,

R +where is the total radiation at 668° C, and 580°C. 7i3 x 46° C. is equal

to the temperature of the substance. If we calculate the total radiation from

the above formida at 2000° C. as compared with that at 668° C, it is in the

ratio of 1 to 112. Regarding these comparisons, they appear fairly within

Wethe limits of experimental errors.  would anticipate that a similar law

would hold alike for heat-rays and light-rays.

Assuming these laws to be approximately correct, it is interesting to find

what hypothetical temperature in the case of a solid or fluid substance would

correspond with the luminosity and total radiation from the sun.

From the experiments of Fizeau and Foucanlt*, the luminous intensity of

Athe sun is found to be 146 times that of the lime-light.  temperature of

13,000° C, according to the formula given above, would give 144 times the

luminous intensity at 2000° C.

From the observations of PouiUet, the total radiation from 1 square centi-

metre of the sun's surface in 1 minute was 85,000 units, and cannot well

exceed 100,000 units. At a temperature of 11,000° C, according to the

above formula for total radiation, the amount would be 50 times that at

2000° C. Now we have found above that a square centimetre of lime at

2000° C. emits 2000 gramme-units per minute, so that a temperature of

11,000° C. would be sufficient to evolve 100,000 gramme-units, as much

heat as is produced by the sun. The recent observations of Soret (' Biblio-

thuque Universelle,' 1872) prove that the total radiation of the sun is between
50 and 60 times that of lime heated to 2000° C. in the oxyhydrogen flame.

the electric arc, by determining the amount of heat evolved when pieces of

carbon, heated between the poles, are thrown into a calorimeter. When a

fifty- cell Bunsen's battery is employed, it is found that 1 gramme of carbon

evolves as a maximum 850 units of heat when cooled from the temperature

it acquires between the poles of the battery. This quantity of heat only

corresponds to a mean temperature of 2000° C. in the heated carbon when

the great increase in the specific heat of carbon is taken into account. In

the experiments made with the battery, no precaution was taken to prevent

the cooling of the piece of carbon between the poles from radiation, and

consequently the substance never attained a uniform temperature. This fact

is easily proved on examining the appearance of the carbon after use, when

the substance is only changed into graphite in a few points. That tempera-

ture at which carbon changes into graphite may, in experiments of this kind,

be used as a fixed point.

The luminous intensity of the electric arc, according to Fizeau and Foucault,

is from 34 to 5G times that of the lime-light when 46 cells are employed, of

small or large surface. According to the empirical formula previously given,

this would correspond to a temperature of from 7000° C. to 8500° C.

   In the course of the experiments with the battery, several determinations

of the total radiation were made by the pyrheliometer. The mean of the

observations, which were remarkably constant, corresponds to a radiation of

7100 gramme-units per minute, being equivalent to a solution of 4*5 grammes

Aof zinc per minute.  concave parabolic mirror 1 yard in diameter, exposed

pei'pendicularly to the sun's rays in this country, concentrates as much radiant

energy as a 50-cell Grove's battery of large surface.

On a Periodicity of Cyclones and Rainfall in connexion with the Sun-
                 spot Periodicity. By Charles Meldrum.

       [A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in exfcnso.']

At the Brighton Meeting (1872) it was stated that the cyclones of the Indian
Ocean, between the Equator and lat. 25° S., were much more freqiient in the
maxima than in the minima sun-spot years.

   Since that time the subject has been more fully examined, and I now beg
to present a Catalogue of all the cyclones known to have occurred in that
part of the world during the last twenty-six years. The Tables given last

year contained only cyclones of sufficient violence to dismast or otherwise
disable vessels at sea, whereas the accompanying Catalogue gives all the

--cyclones of force 9 to 12 that is, "strong gale" to "hurricane."

   The observations for the years 1847 to 1850 are probably not so complete
as those for the subsequent years, during which the Meteorological Society of
Mauritius made it a special duty to collect storm statistics. Still it is evident
that not only the years 1860 and 1872, but also the year 1848, were remark-
able both for the number and violence of cyclones, while the years 1856 and
1867 were quite the reverse.

   By taking the number of cyclones in each maximum and minimum sun-spot
year and in each year on cither side of it, so as to form maxima and minima
periods of thi-ec years each, we obtain the results given in the last column
of the following Table, showing that during the maxima periods 1848 to

1850 and 1859 to 1861 the number of cyclones was 65, whereas iix the
minima periods 1855 to 1857 and 1866 to 1868 it was only 34, or little
more than one half. In 1856 there was only one hurricane of small extent,
and in 1867 no hurricane at aU. Indeed it is doubtful whether several of
the cyclones in the latter year, classed under " storms," should not have been
classed under " whole erales " and " strona- gales."

been examining lists of former hurricanes ; and it is interesting to find that
the evidence from this source strongly corroborates the conclusions deduced

from the observations of the last twenty-six years. From a " Chronological
Table" published in the Mauritius Almanac of 18G9, we obtain the following

list of Mauritius hurricanes :

     Baron Grant, in his 'History of Mauritius' (p. 194), regrets the clestruction
 of the woods near Port Louis, because, he says, the town was thereby " ox-
 posed to the violence of the winds, as well as to the heat of the sun ; " and
 in a footnote it is remarked, " these inconveniences, however, are fully
 counterbalanced, if it be true that tlie cessation of hurricanes since 1789 has
 been caused by the great diminution of the woods."

    As the 'History' was published in or soon after 1801, it would appear
 that during the twelve years (1789 to 1801) no hurricane occurred in the

 island.

   Now since, according to the Tables of sun-spot frequency, the years 1788

"and 1804 were maxima years, and the intervening minimum occurred in

 1798, the theory would lead us to expect a comparative cessation of hur-
 ricanes during the period mentioned.

    If time permitted I would adduce similar evidence respecting the hurri-
 canes of Bourbon (Reunion) and other parts of the world.

    The hurricanes of the Indian Ocean are well known to be attended with
torrential rains. So much is this the case, that the popular belief at Mau-
ritius is that cyclones are the cause of our rains. Heavy rains over exten-

 sive areas are certainly concomitant with cyclones in the Indian Ocean. It
 was therefore determined to examine whether there was also a rainfall perio-
 dicity. As far as the Mauritius observations went, the case was clear

 but it was desii-able to extend the investigation to other localities. The
 Queensland and South- Australian observations gave similar results; and as
 Adelaide is far beyond the limits of tropical cyclones, it was surmised that
there might be a rainfall periodicity generally. The Cape of Good Hope
 observations were afterwards found to support this view. The rainfalls of
England and the Continent of Europe were next examined, and also found

 to be in accordance with the hypothesis.

    It would occupy much more time than I can at present spare to enter
 fully into this question of rainfall periodicity. With the help of researches

 on the same subject by Mr. Lockyer, Mr. Symons, and Dr. Jclinek, of Yienna,

 I have now examined ninety-three tables of the rainfall for various parts

 of the world; and I find that, with few exceptions, more rain has fallen
 in the maxima than in the minima sun-spot years. I beg to append a Table
 showing the general results for the different quarters of the globe. It will be
 seen that, as far as the investigation has gone, Europe, Africa, America, and
 Australia give very favourable results. Asia is represented by only three

 stations, one of which is Jerusalem, where the excess of rain in one minimum
 period exceeds the excess in the maxima joeriods for two stations in India.

 France is the only European country (the rainfall of which has been examined)

 that gives an unfavourable return ; but it must be remarked that we have

 as yet got only five stations in that country, most of which are inland, and

 that they may not fairly represent the whole country.
    By taking tlie longest possible series of observations for several stations

 spread over the globe, a periodicity comes out ; and there is, I think, very

 strong evidence that rainfall is subject to a secular variation, corresponding
 with the sun-spot variation.

     Having given the facts, as far as I have been enabled to do so, I abstain
 from making any theoretical remarks, beyond saying that if cyclone and rain-
 fall periodicities be fully established, a similar (direct) temperature periodi-
 city should also exist, and that sudden variations of solar heat and radiation
 may, by disturbing terrestrial magnetism, be the cause of an increase of
 aurora) and magnetic storms when sun-spots arc most mimcrous.

ON THE STRUCTURE OF CARBONIFEROUS-LIMESTONE CORALS. 479

Fifth Report of the Committee ap2)ointed to investigate the Structure of
    Carboniferous-Limestone Corals. Draivn up by James Thomson,

   Secretary. The Committee consists of Professor Harkness, F.R.S.,

   James Thomson, F.G.S., Dr. Duncan, F.R.S., and Thomas

    Davidson, F.R.S.

During the past year the Committee have continued their investigations with

increased interest. Indeed the longer they continue their investigations in

this branch of pala3ontology, the more they are impressed with its importance ;

and now that they can reproduce in facsimile the internal structures of fossil

corals, they hope that the British Association wiU be convinced of the pro-

priety of continuing these researches.

Within the period embraced by the Report upwards of 200 specimens have

been sliced ; these are from a locality in Fifeshire, which had escaped our

notice. Many of these specimens, in addition to confirming the discovery of
new forms (noticed in a previous Eeport), exhibit structural characteristics

that warrant us in determining two (if not three) new genera.

There are others figured this year in Plates*, upon which we at present

hesitate to decide. They require careful comjjarison before we can feel con-

fident of the group in which they must be classed.

In the Eeport of last year it was stated that the gradations of varieties are

in some cases so constant, and the species pass so imperceptibly into each

other, that we are induced to infer that there has been an inherent tendency

in the polyp to vary independent of, but modified by, the conditions of its
surroundings. It was also stated that it was our intention to figure these

variations, so as to enable us to see what are the essential characteristics that

Wedistinguish the species.  have accordingly prepared six Plates and figured

284 forms, showing in each case the internal structure. The external aspect
is also represented when necessary.

  We have deferred to another occasion our treatment of such forms as

Beamnontia, Alveolites, Favosites, &c. Some palajontologists have doubts as to
whether several genera should be retained among the Eugose Corals, so that
we are the more induced to delay dealing with several forms belonging to
this group ; and we feel convinced that our future researches will bring to
light specimens simpler in organization, but presenting new facts which may

cause considerable alteration in the classification of this group. It is better,

therefore, to wait until these distinctive characteristics are clearly brought

Weout.  have, however, given in (what we provisionally call) Plate I. some

forms which are closely allied to the above.

   Plate I. contains twenty-three figures of the genus Amplexus. Ten of these
forms have not been recorded before, whilst others are now for the first time

recorded as occurring in British strata. These figures represent the develop-

ment of coralline life, passing from the simplest forms to the more complex

structures of the genus, which passes by imperceptible gradations into the
genus Zaphrentls. Prof. De Koninck finds a similar transition in the Moun-

tain-Limestone Corals of Belgium belonging to this genus (Eecherches sur les

Animaux Fossiles Belgique, prem. part. p. 81).
   Pigs. 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, 30, 31, and 32 have not been represented before,

and their structural characteristics are distinctly different from any of the

forms that have hitherto been described.

Plate II. contains sixty-six figures ; twenty-one of these are varieties of

* The Plates referred to in this Eeport will be publisied by Mr. Thomson.
480 REPORT-- 1873.

the genus Zaplirentls. Figs. 8 and 27 represent a new genus ; they are from
Fifeshire. Pig. 8 may possibly be determined as a distinct species. Fig. 7

belongs to the same group, and will form another species. These forms are

readily distinguished from all other corals belonging to this period by the

granular costae.

   Fig. 26 is closely allied to the genvLsLopJiophyllum ; but it differs in structural
characteristics from the species described by Prof. M'Coy in the ' Ann. of Nat.

Hist.,' 2nd series, vol. vii. p. 167, and in ' Brit. Paleeont. Fossils,' p. 90, 1851.
   Figs. 23, 40, 42, and 43 are very much alike in external aspects ; and it is

only from transverse sections that they can be determined as belonging to

distinct species. The other forms figured in this Plate require careful com-

parison before we can determine to what species or even genera they belong.

Plate III. contains thirty-three figures, representing twelve varieties of the

genus Zajphrentls.

   Fig. 1 is Zaphrentis EnnisTcUleni ; and figs. 2, 3, 3 A, 3 B, and 3 C repre-
sent the same coral cut into five different sections, to show the structural

characteristics in the different stages of development.

  Fig. 5 is Zaphrentis Edwardsiana of De Koninck, Fig. 14 is Zaphrentis
Oaerangeri, E. & H.

The internal structures of the other forms upon this Plate have not been

figured before, and therefore we deem it prudent to say nothing about them

until they have been more carefully and closely examined. At some other

time we may return to them,

    Plate IV. represents forty-three species. Figs. 1 to 6 represent varieties

of Amphxus and Zaphrentis. Figs. 3 and 4 have a striking resemblance

externally, but in internal structure they re2)resent two distinct genera, viz.
Amplexus and Zaphrentis ; and this fact confirms the statement made last

year, that we cannot rely upon external aspects for purposes of specific

identification.

Figs. 14, 15, and 26 belong to the genus Lophophyllum. These three forms

have characteristics sufiicient to warrant us in classifying them as distinct

varieties.

Fig. 28 belongs to the same genus, but differs from the others in having

two of the primary septa passing into nearly the centre of the calicular

cavity, and terminating subreniformly at the inner extremity.

   Fig. 21 C is Heterophyllia LyeUii, nat. size. Fig. 21 is the same, magni-

Afied ; 21 is a transverse, and 21 B a longitudinal section of the same.

   Fig. 3G is Heterophyllia grandis. This is the first time that this form has

Abeen recorded from Scotch strata. Fig. 36 is a longitudinal section of the
Dsame, showing the internal structure. Figs. 36 B, 36 C, and 36 are trans-

verse sections, exhibiting structural characteristics at different stages of

development.

Fig. 37 is a new species of the same genus.

AFig. 38 is Heterophyllia anyulata, while figs. 38 and 38 B represent

the structures in longitudinal and transverse sections.

   Figs. 39, 39 A, and 39 B have well-marked specific distinctions. They

must represent forms which differ from the other species of this genus.  The
septal arrangement is quite distinctive. It is certainly a new species.
propose to name it Heterophyllia Phillipsii.                             We

Fig. 40 represents the external aspects of Heterophyllia mirahilis, nat.

size. This is the typical specimen that Dr. Duncan described in the ' Trans-

actions of the Eoyal Society' (1867, p. 643). Fig. 40 B is the same, magni-

fied. This species is distinguished from the other species by a series of

curved spines which are attached to the crown of the costiE. They are
round, and attached to the costfc by a broad, expanded base. The " ball-
and-socket " process alluded to by Dr. Duncan wc have failed to discover.
Fig. 40 C is a transverse section of the same, nat. size.

   Figs. 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 18, 23, 24, 25, 27, 29, 30, 32, 33, 34, and
35 exhibit structural characteristics hitherto unnoticed. Several of these

forms may be seen in many of our museums and private collections named

as Ci/athropsis and Zaphrentis ; but in structure they have no characteristics

common to either of these genera.

   Figs. 21, 38, 40, 41, 42, and 43 are typical specimens of HeteropliyUia,
described by Dr. Duncan in the ' Transactions of the Royal Society ' for

1867.

    Plate V. contains six varieties of genus Clisiopliyllum.
    Fig. 1 represents the external aspect of CUsiophyllam Keyserlingi. This
species is distinguished by the lamellae curving round, and ascending to

the crown of the large conical boss that fills up the centre of the calicular

Acavity. Fig. 1 is a transverse section of the same. Fig. 1 13 exhibits a

longitudinal section, with the columellarian line passing down the centre

of the coral.

   Figs. 3, 3 A, 3 B, and 3 C belong to the same species, and represent the

structures from the earliest to the mature state of development in any

normal specimen.

   Fig. 6 is a transverse section of the largest specimen of the same that has
come under our observation.

   Figs. 2, 4, and 5 are closely allied species, if not varieties.
   Figs. 9, 11, 12, and 13 are distinct species, and illustrate a previous
observation, viz. that specific identification cannot rest on the mere niim-

ber of the lameUse filling up the columellarian space in the centre of the

ealice.

  AFig. 12 is 15 lines in diameter, and has twenty-seven lamella}.

   Fig. 11 is only 6 lines in diameter, and has thirty-seven lamelltc filling up

and forming the conical boss in the centre of the ealice.

    Figs. 7, 8, and 10 are distinct genera. These forms, before being cut,
were classified as genus Cl'mophylUim ; but the transverse sections iiresent

no characteristics in common with that genus. They belong to a genus

quite distinct, and as yet unnamed.

    Plate VI. contains representations of three species of Lonsdcdlui.

   Fig. 1 represents a longitudinal section of LonsdaUia ruyosa. Figs. 1 B
and 1 C exhibit the young coralUtes in their different stages of development.

   Fig. 2 is a transverse section of the same species. In this section we have
delineated the growth from the ovular germ through the different stages of
development to the mature coral. In one stage the embryo coral is seen

passing from the interseptal locula ; in another it is seen semicircular in

outline, and just outside the epitheca. In some it is circular in outline,

Awhilst others exhibit the full development of the septa. Fig. 2 is the

same species, enlarged six diameters.

    Fig. 3 represents LonsdaUia duplicata.

  AFig. 4 is one of the corallites enlarged, with a young corallite attached

to the epitheca, exhibiting the development of the primary septa, which, in

the maturer forms, is seen to fill up the columellarian space.

It wUl thus be seen that we wish to avail ourselves of every fact, and to

delineate the most deUcate structures. To accomplish the latter, our peculiar

Weprocess is well suited.  may thus assist the student and beginner in

identifying specimens; but we may also check tlie superficial and liasty

 generalization and classification of the more advanced.
    In regard to the stratigraphical distribution and duration in time of these

forms, yvG must meantime remain silent ; but by-and-by these will be duly

recorded.

SnoETLY after the last Meeting of the Association I received an intimation

--from the Geographical Society that two expeditions were about to start in

search of Dr. Livingstone the one under Lieut. W. J. Grandy, E.N., by the

--Congo river, and the other, under Lieut. Cameron, from the East Coast and

requesting that anthropological instructions might be furnished to those

officers for their guidance. As not more than a week's notice was given me

of the departure of these expeditions, and it appeared desirable that each

party should be provided with printed instructions, I wrote at once to several

members of the Committee, requesting them to send me a series of questions

for the use of the travellers ; and the following gentlemen having responded

to my appeal without delay, I caused their contributions to be printed in a

small volume having blank leaves for memorandums and answers to the

questions, each of which was numbered ; and a suflicient number were fur-
nished to the officers commanding each expedition, who were requested to

distribute them on the coast to Her Majesty's Consuls, officers of the
Royal Navy, and others who might be in a position to use them, or to place
them in the hands of other travellers who might set out on expeditions

towards the interior from time to time.

   The following Members of the Committee were contributors to this volume,

viz. A. W. Franks, Esq., on General Anthropology; Prof. lloUeston, F.ll.S.,

on  Physical Anthropology                                                                                   Dr. Beddoe, F.ll.S., on  Physical Anthropology ;
                                                                                                         ;

E. B. Tylor, F.ll.S., on llehgions, Mythology, and Customs ; Colonel A. H.

Lane Fox on the Use of Iron in Africa, and on Prehistoric Arcliajology.

    I enclose a copy of these instructions for the information of the General

Committee.

    Although these instructions have been the means of carrying out to a

great extent the wishes of the Council of the Association in appointing the

Committee, and it was important that the opportunity afi'orded by the start-

ing of these expeditions should not be lost, yet as the instructions were
drawn up solely with a view to African exjiloration, and a certain amount of
repetition was apparent in the volume, owing to the hurried manner in
which it was drawn up and printed, so as to be in time for the travellers

before starting, it did not apjiear to me to meet as fully as could be desired

the intentions of the General Committee in placing a grant of £2b at our

disposal, such grant having been intended for the information of travellera
           INSTRUCTIONS FOR TRAVELLERS, ETHNOLOGISTS, ETC.           483

In general rather than for the use of travellers in any one quarter of the

globe. I have therefore defrayed the cost of printing at my own expense,
and the amount has been made up to me by copies purchased by the Geo-

graphical Society, the Anthropological Institute, and bj^ Mr. Franks. This

volume, therefore, although issued under the auspices and with the approval

of the Committee, will not be charged to the Association.

   The Committee for drawing up " General Instructions for Travellers " met

--on the 21st of N^ovember, 1872, when the following resolutions were passed :

1. That the work to be published by the Committee shall consist ot

numbered sections, each section being prefaced by a few lines of explanatory

notes and followed by questions.

2. That the notes and questions shall be expressed as briefly as possible.

3. That the Secretary be requested to draw up the headings of about 100

sections, and submit them to the Committee at their next meeting.

4. That the Secretary be requested to draw up a specimen section or

sections upon half margin, and circulate them amongst the Members of the

Committee for their remarks previously to the next meeting of the Com-

mittee.    , , ., ...

5. Tliat the title of the work shall be " Notes and Queries on Anthropology

for the use of Travellers and Residents in uncivilized lands."

   6. That M. Broca's chromatic tables bo adopted ; and that Dr. Beddoe be
requested to communicate with him for the purpose of ascertaining in what

manner they can be most economically reproduced in this country.

Acting upon these resolutions I drew up a list of 100 sections, which,

having been circulated amongst the members for their remarks, have been

printed in their approved form and are herewith annexed, together with the

names of some of the authors to whom the sections have been submitted for ·
detailed questions. Two specimen sections have also been circulated, and

have been approved by the Committee.

Owing to the large number of contributors there has been some delay in

collecting the contributions of the several authors. The sections have,
however, now been completed continuously up to No. XLII., and some of

the later ones have also been received ; these sections arc now in manuscript
ready for printing. The sections have been divided into three parts,

Part I. relating to the Constitution of Man, Part II. to Culture, and Part

III. to Miscellaneous Questions relating to Anthropology. The List of Sec-

tions will form an index to the volunre ; and for convenience of reference

the sections have been numbered in Koman figures, the questions in italics.
Each section has been submitted to some writer who is known to have

devoted his special attention to the siibject referred to him, and, as far as

possible, the best known authorities have been selected.

   The cost of printing the part already in type amcmnts to ^'3 ; that of
the MS. already in hand has been estimated at ^10.

The probable cost of the whole work, including illustrations and the chro-

matic tables, will be about <£oO.

Viewing the importance of the contributions already received and the scien-

tific status of the contributors, and considering that the work is exhaustive

of its subject and calculated to suffice for the use of travellers for some time,

to come, I would suggest, on- behalf of -the Committee, that the grant o*

.£25 voted at the last Meeting be renewed, and .£25 added to complete the

work. The volume may then be jiublished wiHiont delay.
   It may be estimated that the sale of copica will cover a portion of the

expenses,

                                                                2x2

Preliminary Note from the Ccmmittee, consisting of Professor Bal-
   four, Convener, Dr. Cieghorn, Mr. Robert Hutch isoNj Mr. Alex-
   ander BucHANj and Mr. John Sadler^ on the Influence of Forests

    on the Rainfall.

After some inquiry and correspondence the Committee heard of two
localities, viz. Carnwath, Lanarkshire, and Abernethy, Speyside, Moray-
shire, which seemed likely to be suitable stations for carrying on the
inquiry entrusted to them, owing to wood likely to be cut down soon, and
assistance expected from the proprietors. The station in the Speyside
district the Committee have not yet been able to visit ; but a Subcommittee,
consisting of Dr. Cleghorn and Mr. Buchan, visited. Carnwath on the
11th of July, 1873.
ON THE INFLUENCE OF FORESTS ON THE KAINFALL.  489

   Carnwath has been one of the stations of the Scottish Meteorological
Society since the beginning of 1869, and, through the hberality of Hector F.
M'Lean, Esq., Carnwath House, is sujiplied with a full equipment of
instruments, all of which have been compared. The observer is Mr. AVilliam

Currie, Clerk to Mr. M'Lcan. He was formerly observer at Eallabus, Islay,
and is, in the opinion of Mr. Buchan, in every way one of the best observers

of the Scottish Meteorological Society.

   Three stations were placed at the disposal of the Committee, and
Mr. M'Lean offered most handsomely to cut down the trees at the station
which should be selected, at the time and in the quantity which would, in
the opinion of the Committee, best suit the objects of the inquiry.

   The three localities were visited by the Subcommittee, who had no
difficulty in fixing on one of these as the best. Its situation is shown on
a plan, traced from the Trigonometric Survey. [This plan was exhibited at

the Meeting.]

   At the point marked I. is placed the anemometer of the station, on the top
of a grassy knoll, free to the winds all round. At a distance of 320 yards to
the S.S.W., at point marked II., in centre of patch coloured red, is a wooded
knoll precisely similar and nearly of the same height. Immediately on west
of top of this knoll is a circular patch 50 feet in diameter, quite clear of
trees, covered with a fine, close, grassy sward, containing well-grown
specimens of Veronica officinalis, V. cliamceclrys, Galium saxatile, FotentiUa,
Tormentilla, Ranunculus acris, and a few roots of Lastrca Filix-mas.

   Trees (mixed, but chiefly pines) from 30 to 40 feet high surround this
patch on aU sides. The extent of woodland in which it is proposed to place
the station is 62| acres ; but there is a much greater extent of woodland in

the neighbourhood.

  --The Committee propose to erect two sets of instruments one beside

the anemometer at I., the other in the centre of the open space of the
wooded knoll at II., each set to be in every respect ahke, and to consist of

the following :

        1 Maximum Thermometer.
        1 Minimum Thermometer.

         1 Dry- and Wet-bulb Hygrometer.
          1 Stevenson's Louvre-boarded Box, for holding the thermometers.

     The instruments to be read twice daily, viz. at 9 a.m. and 9 r.ir., in con-

  nexion with those at the station of the Scottish Meteorological Society at the
 point marked III., and always in the same order.

      It is proposed, for one year at least, to compare the observations on the
 wooded and naked knoUs, and to cut down none of the trees ; and it is also

  proposed to delay the planting of rain-gauges at I. and II. until a sufficient
  space has been cleared around II. by cutting, the Committee being of opinion
  that observations from a gauge planted in the small patch of II. surrounded
  with trees 30 to 40 feet high, and at no greater distance than 25 feet, would
  give results worse than useless.

^ The Committee hope, in the course of a few months, to be able to
  make arrangements for the establishment of the second station at Speyside,

  where the forests are pure Scotch fir of magnificent growth, for which
  instruments similar to those procured for Carnwath will be required. To
  meet this outlay and the payment of observers, the Committee will require

  a renewal of the grant of £20 from the British Association for 1873-74.
490  KEi'oiix-- 1873.

                 Appendix added hy the Committee, 2nd March, 1874.

   The Committee are of opinion that the problem of the Influence of Forests
on the Rainfall cannot be directly attacked, but must be preceded by a pre-
liminary inquiry into the temperature and humidity of the air of the forest
itself, as compared with the temperature and humidity of the air outside
the forest. The observations referred to above wiU supply these data. The
Committee also contemplate the placing of underground thermometers and
evaporometers at Stations Nos. I. and II., and the examination of the tem-
perature of the trees by means of thermometers permanently fixed in them,
in the manner adopted at the forest-stations of Bavaria.

Report of Sub-Wealden Exploration Committee, appointed at the

   Brighton Meeting, 1873, consisting of Henry Willett, R. A.
   Godwin-Austen, F.R.S., W. Topley, F.G.S., T. Davidson, lUl.S.,
   J. Pkestwich, F.R.S., W. Boyd Uawkins, F.R.S., and Henry
  Woodward, F.R.S. Drawn up by Henry AVillett and W.

   TOPLEY.

The x'>i'opo.sal to commemorate the visit of the Association to Brighton bj'
some practical effort to extend the bounds of scientific knowledge was
received with unexpected favour, and the support given to the Sub-Wealdeu

Exploration has justified its selection as the most eligible unsolved scientific

problem in the south-east of England. This Report may bo considered a
summary of the transactions more fully detailed in the four quarterly reports

of the Honorary Secretary.
   The original project was for a bore of 6-1- inches ; but this was overruled

by the Committee in London, and the adoption of a diameter of 9 inches was
decided on. The opinion of Prench engineers of eminence was adduced by
Joseph Prest\vich, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S., in favour of this increase, and pro-
bable success to the iiltimate depth required was considered more important
than the increased cost. The bore-hole has reached (at the full diameter of
9 inches) a depth of 300 feet, and the engineer has contracted to increase
it to the depth of 418 feet at the cost only of £1 per foot. The diameter of

9 inches may be considered merely the foundation of the work, and, like
all foundations, it makes but a small show for the money expended.

    The shedding, machinery, tools, and rods for a depth of nearly 1000 feet
have been purchased, but much time and money must be expended before
2000 feet or palasozoic strata are reached.

    300 feet of strata have already been examined : 70 feet are supposed to
represent the known Eounden-Wood beds ; 230 feet are new to science, of
which 50 feet consist of valuable beds of gypsum.

   Professor Eamsay states " no such beds of gypsum have hitherto been
found in Europe;" and Mr. Etheridge considers "that it is the most
important geological discovery made in England for the last twenty years."

    The cores exhibited prove, bj^ their horizontal bedding, that hitherto the
crest of the anticlinal axis has been undisturbed, fully justifying the
selection of the site. Mr. Topley explains more fuUy (in his accompanying

Report) the general geological features.
ON SUn-WJKALDEN EXl'LOKATION.  191

  TIt being found impossible to lore (and that tbo drilling by the chisel in

ordinary use so crushed up the debris as to baffle examination), the Honorary
Secretary designed a novel form of drill possessing the following advantages :

                 1st. It cuts only the circumference,

               2nd. It makes better progress.
              3rd. The central core is left intact.
              4th. The tool not unfrequently extracts the core itself.

   The gypsum shovrn was thus extracted. No such cores have, it is believed,

in this country been brought to the surface from similar deptlis.

  A plan of an ingenious form of electromagnet for the extraction of broken

pieces of steel from the bottom of the bore-hole M'as exhibited. It was suggested
by J. R. Capron, Esq., of Guildford, and designed by Professor John Tyndall,
F.R.S., assisted by Messrs. Tisley and Spiller.

   The question of cost is a serious one. The only definite contract for con-
tinuing the work from a depth of 218 feet to 1500 feet (including the use
of the tools, machineiy, engine, &c. belonging to the Committee) was over

£5000, When an application for a grant was made in 1872 a large sum

was not asked for, and i't was deemed more consistent to await the first
year's report ; not only has the £25 voted been expended, but over =£2000
has been subscribed by other parties, aU of which wiU have been expended
before the expiration of the current year ; large additional subscriptions wiU

therefore be required.

  A reference to the names forming the Central Committee will convince

that the best method for ultimate success will be adopted.
    It is therefore hoped that the Association will consider it advisable to

reappoint the Committee, and to vote an increased grant for the prosecution
of the work.

   In addition to the actual cost of the work of the boring, the expense
incurred has much exceeded the estimate. This excess is attributed to the
foUowiug causes, many of which will not again occur :

         I. The increased diameter of the bore.
       II. The distance travelled by the engineer.
     III. The cost of shelter in so exposed a situation, it being impossible to

               get men to work A^dthout it.
      IV. The cost of carriage, from the inaccessible nature of the roads &c.
       V. The large increased cost of fuel.
      VI. The necessity of providing forge, tools, &c. in anticipation of future

                  demands.
     VII. The original expenses of sui'vey and commencement.
    VIII. Printing and postage in soliciting subscribers.

Geological Bepori, drawn up hy W. Topley, F.G.S., of the Geological Survey

                                        of England and Wales.

   Hitherto almost all borings have been made for the purpose of solving some

probable anticipation, or for the discovery of something definitely required,
as coal or water. In such cases, if the object sought for be found, the boring

is said to be successful ; if not, it is said to have failed. With the Sub-
Wealden boring, however, failure can only arise by a premature arrest of the
492 KEPOKX--Ibra.

work, either by an accident to the bore-hole or from want of funds. Should
the boring be continued, the result, whatever it may be, will be a success. It
is important that this should be once more distinctly stated, for the Sub-
Wealden boring is too often spoken of as a " search for coal ;" so that, should
coal not be found, we shall certainly be told that our project has failed, and that
so much money has been thrown away by ignorant theoretical speculators.

   Now, while the originators of this undertaking, as well as the members of
this Committee, are fully alive to the immense national benefit which would

result from the discovery of coal in the south-east of England, they do not

put this forward as the primary object, nor has any money been solicited with
any such intention. The sole object of the exploration is to discover what
beds underlie the Wealden, and especially to reach the Palteozoic rocks.
This we have every reason to hope will be done ; and whatever those rocks
may prove to be, if we can only reach them, the Sub-Wealden exploration

will then have been a success.
    Should the Association think fit to renew the grant and to reappoint the

Committee, we may confidently hope that future Reports wUl contain impor-

tant additions to our knowledge of the geology of the south-east of England.
The present Report must be regarded merely as a preliminary one ; and it

may be well at this stage to refer to some general questions, and to clear
the way for future Reports.

   Dr. Mantell was the first geologist who carefully studied the interior of the
Weald. He divided the Hastings beds (or Hastings sands, as they were then

called) into four divisions :

Horsted Sand.  "Worth Sands.

Tilgate beds.  Ashburnham beds.

   "WTien the geological survey of the Weald was first commenced, Pr. Mantell's
terms and divisions were adopted ; but it was soon found that they were in-
applicable in some parts. The classification adopted by the Survey is that
proposed by Mr. Drew, whose account of it was laid before the Geological

Society in 1861.

   Unfortunately the Survey retained Dr. Mantell's term (Ashburnham beds)
for the lowest strata, and followed him in considering the limestone beds of
Poundsford to be the same as the mottled clays, which are the lowest strata
seen on the coast. Not only are the limestone beds of Poundsford below the
clays of Eairlight, but neither of these are the equivalents of the strata at
Ashburnham itself, which lie near the bottom of the Wadhurst Clay. Near
the base of this clay, and lying in or near to the nodules of clay ironstone,
which were formerly extensively worked, there is a bed of ferruginous lime-
stone crowded with Cyrcnce. Dr. Mantell thought this to be identical with
the shelly limestone found near Poundsford ; and wherever he met with it

he noted the occurrence of Ashburnham beds. Many of the localities men-

tioned are certainly in Wadhurst Clay.
    In Dr. Fitton's opinion, the strata of Poundsford, Archer's Wood, &c. were

--lower than any others in the Weald ; and he adds : '· From the general

structure of the tract surrounding Brightling, the ravines at the base of the
prominence on which the Observatory stands ought evidently to afford the
lowest strata of the country"*.

   A detailed survey of the entire district has proved that he was correct, and

 that it is just at this spot (in Rounden Wood) that the lowest strata are
brought to the surface. More recent examination of the district has deter-

mined the Director of the Survey to separate these beds. The clays of the

coast are now called " Fairlight Clays '' (Mr. Gould's term), while the lowest

limestone scries of the inland district are coloured as Purbecks.

The difference in the strata rendered such a change in the classification

desirable, and it has been confirmed by the discovery of thick beds of gypsum

in the Sub-Wealden boring. Although found in detached blocks in the
Purbeck beds of Dorsetshire, gypsum was unknown before in the Weald. It

should also be noticed that the Ashdown Sand, which comes between the

Fairlight Clays and the Wadhurst Clay, is only about 150 feet thick at

Hastings ; but the Ashdown Sand of the Brightling district (including under

that term all the strata intervening between the Wadhurst Clay and the

WePurbecks) is 300 or 400 feet thick.            may then fairly assume that the

lower part of these sands (which is much more clayey than the upper part)

represents the Fairlight Clays of the coast.

In classing these beds with the Purbecks we are only repeating the

opinion of Mr. Conybeare (the earliest geological writer on the district).

Subsequently they have been referred to the Purbecks by Sir H. De la Beche,

Prof. Edward Forbes, Dr. Fitton, Mr. Godwin-Austen, and others ; in some

cases even by Dr. Mantell himself.

   The Purbeck beds of Sussex consist chiefly of clays and shales. The lime-

--stones are chiefly found upon two horizons an upper one, called " the

greys " or " the vein-greys," and a lower one, called " the blues." These are

separated by about 100 or 140 feet of shales, interspersed with only a few

thin beds of limestone and a little sandstone. Below the "blues" are impure

limestones (bastard blues). The lowest strata known previous to the boring
were the " dunk shaws," thin flaggy limestones found in Eounden Wood,

crowded with Ctipridea valdensis.

The total thickness hitherto known may be estimated at a little over

300 feet.

The boring at Netherfield began at a point about 250 feet down in the

Purbecks, just below the "blues." Mr. Willett and Mr. AV. Boyd Dawkins

proposed the site ultimately chosen ; and no other spot in the district would,

all things considered, have presented equal advantages.

The strata passed through up to the present time (September 1873) are as

follows :

    The higher beds marked as " limestones " in the horing-scction are
mostly impure. These are the " bastard blues." Below these, in Eounden
Wood, there are other limestones known as the " Eounden greys,"' and then

come the "Dunk shaws." The " greys" and " blues " are easily identified
by the workmen whenever they occur. The " Dunk shaws " are peculiar in

character ; but as neither they nor the " Roiinden greys " have been identi-

fied in the boring, they may be a local peculiarity. The new discovery of
gypsum is an important addition to the Purbeck series of Sussex. The two

principal beds of gypsum consist of perfectly white alabaster. The gypseous
shales are dark in colour, but they contain .so much gypsum that, when
pulverized, they appear almost white. The gypsum is mostly evenly bedded
but that found in the shales is nodular and irregular in structure. It is not
improbable that at or near this horizon gypsum will occur over a considerable
area in the Sussex Purbecks ; and it probably occurs not far below the sur-
face at the bottom of the " rough field " in Eounden Wood.

   With regard to the dci^th at which the Palaeozoic rocks are likely to occur
beneath the Weald, I may remind you that 700 feet has been mentioned as
a probable minimum, and 1700 feet as a probable maximum. It would
seem, from borings already made in other districts, that the depth of the

palaeozoic floor below the present sea-level is to a large extent independent
both of the newer formations above it and of the apparent disturbances which
are supposed to have affected them. The borings at Kentish Town, Harwich,
Ostend, and Calais, all reach the palaeozoic floor at a depth only slightly
exceeding, or slightly less than, 1000 feet below the sea-level ; and in these

cases the higher strata passed through are of very varying character and

thickness. These, however, are all on, or to the north of, the supposed westerly
extension of the "Axis of Artois," and it is possible that ditferent conditions

prevail to the south of that line.

   I may also remind you that, in the Pays dc Bray, Carboniferous Limestone

occurs at a depth of 59 feet from the surface, underlying Kimmeridge Clay.
It is this presence of the Carboniferous Limestone in this position which gives
some slight hope of the occurrence of Coal-measures near Boulogne and in
our Wealden area further west. Mr. Godwin-Austen has pointed out that

                                                                                     i
ON SCIENCE-LKCTURES AND ORGANIZATION.  495

the general dip of the Carboniferous Limestone of the Boulonnais is to the
south ; and this is the di]) where tlicy are last seen passing beneath the
unconformable secondary rocks. As Carboniferous Limestone occurs under the

Pays de Bray, it is not unlikely that some Coal-measures may be preserved in

a palojozoic trough between these places.

                                            [Read at the Brighton Meeting.]

Your Committee endeavoured in the first place to obtain a clear view into

the nature and extent of their possible sphere of action, as defined in the. two
following Resolutions, by which they were appointed at the Meeting at

Edinburgh :--

       1. To consider and report on the best means of advancing Science by

             Lectures, with authority to act, subject to the approval of the Covmcil,
            in the course of the present year if judged desirable.

       2. To consider and report whether any steps can be taken to render
           scientific organization more complete and effectual.

    In this endeavour your Committee have been greatly aided by the follow-
ing statement handed iii by Dr. Joule, clearly pointing out the general
oljjects which should be aimed at in Science Organization in this country.
496 REPORT--1873.

                                          Dr. Joule^s Statement.

    Ill order to render scientific organization as complete and effectual as a

great nation may rightly demand that it should be, it is essential to obtain

the authority of and material assistance by Government. This view is
evidently in harmony with that which has been adopted by the country
respecting national education. Indeed the education of the people in the
rudiments of knowledge will prove comparatively useless if the higher
developments are not fostered with at least equal care.

   The following are some of the principal objects to be obtained by a
more complete organization, for which Government aid is imperatively
demanded :

1. Observatories for the continual watching of

a. Astronomical phases.

b. Meteorological phenomena, including Magnetism of the Earth.

        c. Tides and Sea-level.

2. Museums for permanent collections of

a. Specimens in Natural History.

b. ,,                   Chemistry.

c. ,,                   Geology and Mineralogy.

d. Manufactured products.

e. Machines, tools, &c.

       f. Scientific Apparatus.
3. Libraries of books on Science, comprising the Transactions of British

and Foreign Societies.

4. Publication of complete classified catalogues of scientific researches,

inventions, and discoveries in this and other countries.

5. Scientific researches.

C. Inquiries, at the instance of Government, respecting

a. Artillery, Ships, Fortifications, &c. ; also

b. Mines, Adulterations, Sanitary matters, &c.

7. Scientific Expeditions.

8. Verification and issue of Scientific Instruments.

9. Scientific Instruction by

          a. The Foundation of Chairs.

b. Popular Lectures.

10. Rewards for discoveries, researches, and inventions.

   The first of the above objects has been treated of by Professor Balfour
Stewart. It is most desirable that thoroughly efficient observatories should

be established in various localities of the British empire.

   Complete museums and libraries should be founded and scientific instruc-

tion provided in all the centres of large populations. It is impossible to be
satisfied with national collections in the metropolis only, and with instruc-

tion supplied in a few and sometimes ill-chosen localities, when we regard

the present wants of society.

   The fourth object has been undertaken by the Royal Society. It is, how-
ever, absurd to expect that it can be attained in the completeness which is

absolutely essential to the progress of science without the continuous supply
of ample funds.

   Government has already done something to promote the fifth object, espe-
cially by its grant to the Royal Society. The result has certainly been to
encourage further steps in the same direction. The same remark applies to

the seventh object.

                                                                                i
       ON SCIENCii-LECTUKES AND ORGANIZATION.                             497

   The sixth object is of immediate concern to the State. At the present day,
when war has been raised from an art to a science, it would be the height of

folly not to secure the best theoretical talent that the country can afford.

Under the head (6) it may be remarked that the commonest feelings of

humanity call for authoritative and intelligent interference with arrange-

ments and processes by which the lives and happiness of so many are so

frequently imperilled.

   The verification and issue of scientific instruments is a most important
duty, and ought to be undertaken by a body armed with authority sufficient
to secure the use not only of instruments which are correct, but whose
indications are on a uniform system of units. The duty of verification has

been undertaken by the Kew Observatory with such good results as to

encourage further efforts over a wider field.

   The objects proposed are extensive, and would involve some difficulty in
carrying them into effect. But the benefits to be attained are so immense

that these considerations should not be allowed to weigh. Moreover, existing
Societies, several of which possess a very complete organization, would supply
a great deal of the necessary machinery, so that the chief business of the
Government would be to supervise, give authority, and furnish the necessary
funds *.

   Your Committee, believing that the only mode of making progress in so
wide a field as that described by Dr. Joule was to select some few points upon
which to commence action, determined to appoint three Subcommittees for the
purpose of taking up the discussion of three of the above-named objects.

  --Subcommittee A. To discuss and report on the first of the resolutions

under which the Committee was appointed, viz. the best means of advancing

Science by Lectures.

  --Subcommittee B. To discuss and report on the question of Scientific

Organization as regards Meteorology.

 --Subcommittee C. To discuss and report on the question of Scientific

Organization as regards Local Scientific Societies.
    Reports from the above Subcommittees have been received; their substance

is as follows:

--Subcommittee A. On the best means of advancing Science by Lectures.

    In accordance with the first original resolution, the Council of the Asso-
ciation, on February 28th, 1872, gave permission to the proposed action of

your Committee as regards Science-Lectures. The Subcommittee A was

charged with the preparation for one year of a list of lectures for the con-
sideration of your Committee, and with the task of communicating with the

various towns with the view of establishing a system of Science-Lectures

throughout the country. The necessity of establishing some regulation under
which the names of proposed Lecturers should be selected became at once

--apparent. The following regulations were ultimately adopted: (1) The

names of the Lecturers to be selected (with their consent) from Members of
the General Committee of the Association, or from amongst the Graduates of
any University of the United Kingdom. (2) The subjects of the Lectures

shall be such as are included in one or other of the Sections of the Associa-

tion. Circulars were then sent to a certain number of gentlemen asking for

their cooperation in the delivery of Science-Lectures in various parts of the

* See Lord Wrottesley's Address to tlie Koyal Society, Nov. 30, 1865 ; also Keport of

the Parliamentary Committee to the British Association at Glasgow, 1855.

kingdom. It is clearly understood, aud distinctly stated in the circular, that
neither your Committee nor the Association can be iu any way responsible
for the pecuniary arrangements which must in each case be made between
the Lecturer and the Institution or persons engaging nis services. It is also
not intended to publish the list of Lecturers, but simply to send the same to

the various Institutions who may apply for information. The Subcommittee
have received many promises of assistance from many eminent and well-

qualified lecturers; the list is, ho\vever, not yet completed, and, owing to the
difficulty of getting the several members resident in the country to meet
together, it has not been possible as yet to open any communication with the
various towns or institutions as to the further spread of the Science-Lectures
throughout the country ; it is, however, hoped that speedy action in this

direction may be taken. Your President, Dr. Carpenter, has taken special

interest in this branch of your Committee's proceedings ; and he writes that
he is sure, from applications which he is continually receiving, that an organ-
ization for the promotion of Science-Lectures would do great service by
facilitating arrangements between such as want them and such as can effi-
ciently supply the want, and by making known what experience shows to be
the best method.

   --Subcommittee B. On Science-Organization as regards Meteorology.

   The following statements from Professor Balfour Stewart [embodying
certain remarks of Mr. Baxendell] and from Mr. Lockyer, containing their

opinion as to the present condition of Meteorological Science, have been
received by your Committee.

                                          Prof. Stewart's Statement,

   The subject under the consideration of the Subcommittee is a very exten-
sive one, and I am not prepared at this moment to present any thing like a

complete statement of the subject ; nevciliicless there are two very pressing
wants of observational science to which 1 tiiiuk attention ought to be directed
without delay, and which I therefore beg to bring before the Subcommittee.

The first of these refers to aid in meteorological investigations. There is
probably no science which depends more for its progress upon the patient
and laborious reduction and discussion of numerous and extensive series
of observed facts than that of meteorology. Hundreds of valuable series of
meteorological observations, some of them extending over long periods of
years, have been made and published, at a great cost of both time and
money ; but hitherto no results have been obtained from them at all pro-
portionate to the enormous outlay they have involved, the reason being that
the close application and labour and expenditure of time required to carry
out meteorological investigations are usually much greater than private indi-

viduals can afford to devote to them. It is therefore absolutely necessary
for the interests of the science that State aid should be given to scientific

men who are willing to undertake meteorological investigations of the nature

of reductions, provided they can show that the objects they have in view are

--of sufficient importance to justify a moderate expenditure in endeavours to

attain them this aid to be given in the form of pecuniary grants, to defray
the expense of engaging assistants to make such reductions and tabulations
of observations aud results and such computations as the nature of the
investigations may require. If proper representations were made to Govern-
ment on this subject, there is little doubt that something would be done;

for Government are at this moment largely subsidizing the observational part

of meteorology.

It is, however, very evident that unless the facts so accumulated can be

thrown open sufficiently to men of science their use will be limited. In the

establishment of the Meteorological Office, Government have virtually allowed

that the proper maintenance of a sufficient number of observing-stations

cannot be expected from private means ; but they appear to have forgotten

that it is also necessary to open up these observations to men of science, and

to provide the necessary means for discussing them.

  When it is considered that it is now an established fact that meteorological

changes have more to do with the production of diseases and death than all

other known causes, it will be apparent that, besides its uses for the purposes

of navigation and in the operations of the agriculturist, a knowledge of the

laws and principles of meteorological science has an important bearing upon

the welfare of all classes of the community, and that therefore the advance-

ment of meteorology ought to be an object of anxious solicitude to every

civilized Government.

The second point to which I would direct attention is the bearing of Solar

Physics upon meteorology.

Recent investigations have increased the probability of a physical con-

nexion between the condition of the sun's surface and the meteorology and

magnetism of our globe.

In the first place, we have the observations of Sir E. Sabine, which seem

to indicate a connexion between sun-spots and magnetic disturbances, inas-

much as both phenomena are periodical, and have their maxima and minima

at the same times.

   On the other hand, the researches of Mr. Baxendell appear to indicate a

relation between the daily wind-currents of the earth and its magnetism, and

also between the earth's wind-currents and the state of the sun's surface.

In the last place, the researches of Messrs. De La Rue, Stewart, and

Loewy appear to indicate a connexion between the behaviour of sun-spots and

the positions of the more prominent planets of our system. Whatever be the

probability of the conclusions derived from these various researches, they at

least show the wisdom of studying together for the future these various

branches of observational science.

Now, while a good deal has been done of late years in extending meteoro-

logical and magnetical observations, very little has been done in the way of
taking daily photographs of the sun's surface. Mr. Warren De La Rue has

undertaken, since 1862, the charge of the Photo-heliograph belonging to the

Royal Society at the Kew Observatory ; and the Royal Society have hitherto

contributed yearly funds from the Government Grant for the working of this

instrument ; but this annual grant from the Royal Society is about to expire.

Unless, therefore, these solar autographs shall continue to be obtained at

private expense, we shall, in February 1872, be without a single station,

either in the British Isles or, as far as we know, in any favourable part of the

earth's surface, from which any thing approaching to a sufficiently regular

production and discussion of sun-pictures is likely to proceed.

It has already been acknowledged by Government, in the formation of the

Meteorological Board, that it is beyond the power of private liberality t/t
maintain such regular and long-continued observations ; we therefore trust

that they will once more come forward and establish stations in which the

sun's surface may be regularly mapped, and the positions and areas of sun-

spots regularly measured.

                                                                 2k2
--500 REPORT 1873.

    Again, in connexion with these solar researches, it is of importance to

know both the lieating and actinic effects of our luminary, and how these

vary, not only from hour to hour, but from day to day and from year to year.

   No instrument has, however, yet been devised by which the heating-effect

can be conveniently registered. On the other hand, Dr. Roscoe has perfected

his method of observing the actinic effect so as to make it automatic ; and

thus a series of hourly observations of this element of the sun's activity can

be very easily obtained. This ought to be done at every station where the

surface of the sun is mapped ; and we understand that this plan of Dr. Roscoe's

is about to be adopted in all Russian observatories. It would thus appear
that we are now in a position to define with precision what ought to be done

at a sun-station ; and, as long as the sun-establishment at Kew lasts, ob-
servers may there receive instruction in solar photography through the
courtesy of Mr. De La Rue.

They may also receive instruction in the art of measuring the areas and

position of sun-spots through the same source ; and, finally. Dr. Roscoe will

be glad to give the necessary instruction in actinic observations.

It is hardly necessary to remark that the stations should be so selected as,

taken together, to be independent of weather, and to be capable of giving at

least one picture of the sun's disk every day without the chance of inter-

Weruption.  know enough of the climate of various places to bring about

this result ; and in our dependencies, if not in Great Britain, we have a suffi-
cient area from which to choose our stations.

The influence of weather in causing blank days is particularly detrimental

in solar research. In the observations lately reduced by Messrs. De La Rue,

Stewart, and Loewy, it has been found that a good record of the behaviour of

sun-spots, with regard to increase and diminution, as they pass across the

disk, is of great value ; but that, owing to blank days, this record can only be
obtained for half the whole number of spots observed, and even for this half

in a more or less imperfect manner. And it is of so much greater importance

to select the stations so as to obtain a conluiuous record, inasmuch as such

observations are not like experiments which may be multiplied ad libitum
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

for here we are furnished in a year with a record of a certaiu number of sun-
spots and no more ; and it remains with us to make the best possible use of

the limited information which nature gives us.

In fine it is believed that a daily record of the sun's surface, accompanied

by a record of his actinic power, is, in the present state of science, of the

greatest possible importance.

   In the preceding remarks no allusion has been made to the establishment

--of regular spectroscopic observations of the sun's disk not because it is con-

sidered unimportant, but because it forms a separate branch of inquiry, which

will be best reported upon by Messrs. Janssen and Lockyer, and by Dr. Hug-
gins, gentlemen who have especially devoted themselves to this subject.

   Your Committee have received the following communication on the im-

portance of the establishment of regular Spectroscopic Observations of the
Sun's Disk from Mr. Lockyer.

                                     Mr. Lockyer^s Statement.

   The following are some among the secular inquiries which in my opinion

ought to be undertaken at once on a perfectly definite basis and" with un-

sweiving regularity. Of course I have not named all the secular inquiries,

nor have I alluded to any of the special ones which are suggested almost
ON SCIENCE-LECTURES AND ORGANIZATION.  501

every time one looks at the sun. These must be provided for, of course ; but
the great thing is not to lose time in starting the work in which time plays
the most important part. I think the future will show that in its broad
outline this work is as follows :

                      a. Observations on the Janssen-Lockyer Method.

Prominences at limb :
      1. Number.
      2. Position on sun, with reference to spots and faeulse.
      3. Height and brilliancy.

       4. Materials.

      5. Currents, direction, and velocity.
      6. Thickness of lines at top and bottom.

Prominences on sun :
     7. Number.

       8. Position (as above).
       9. Materials.

    10. Rate of elevation or depression.
    10a. Width of lozenge,
    1 1 Thickness and briUiancy of lines and associated bright lines in spectrum

             of photosphere.

Spots :
    12. Lines thickened.
    13. Thickness of lines.
    14. Alterations of wave-length.
    15. Variations of spectrum near spots, including bright lines.

Faeulse :
    16. Thinning and disappearance of lines.
    17. Bright photospheric lines.

                             b. Observations on Kirchhoff' s Method.

   18. Map frequently suspected regions of spectrum to detect changes in

            Fraunhofer lines.

    19. Determine accurately every three or six months the thickness of the
            principal Fraunhofer lines.

    20. Note changes in bright lines.

    If the Committee wish, I shall be happy to state at length the reasons
which have led me to consider these observations as of high importance and
of a secular nature. I may at once, however, very briefly point out, seeing
that observations of the spots are considered valuable on all hands, that as
the prominences occur in regions where the pressure is less than at the spot-

level, they will be likely to afford better indications of the fact of the solar
forces being at work ; and as there is reason to believe that they are connected

with the spots, we shall get more complete evidence in the same direction as

Wethat given by the spots. But we may get very much more than this.

now know that the sun's atmosphere extends 10' at least above the spot-
level ; we may therefore hope in this way to catch shorter periods than the

sun-spot periods. Again, the spectroscope takes us beyond the fact oiforces
being at work. The bright prominences and the lozenges seen on the sun
itself, the thickening of lines in spots, and the alterations of wave-length are
502 REPORT--1873.

unmistakable evidences of what is going on ; we get an idea of what forces
are at work. But spots are not alone in question.

   I say a few words with reference to some of the proposed lines of obser-

vation.

                                                     Prominences at Limb.

We1. This is clearly necessary.                      must have a prominence-curve as well as

a sun-spot one.

   2. In this way we shall be able to do for prominences what Carrington
has done for the distribution of the spot in latitude, and in time settle another
question about which there is much contradictory assertion among foreign

observers at present.

   3. For this perhaps C and brilliancy at base should be universally adopted.
It will doubtless prove of much importance ultimately to keep to the division

of prominences I have proposed in a paper communicated to the Royal

Society.

   4. Some one line in the case of each element must be taken and kept to.
These observations have already given me much evidence of this kind

                                                     a,

                                                     +a b,
                                                     +a-\-b c,
                                                     + +a b-}-c d;

and the series should be extended as far as possible. The structure of the
solar and stellar atmospheres cannot be got at in a more convenient manner

than this at present ; and as the lines indicate the vapours above the highest

level of the photosphere we may look for secular changes.

    6. I have already evidence, I think, of change since 1868.

                                             Prominences on Sun.

   7, 8, 9, 10, 11. The observations are complementary to those made at

the limb.

    12, 13. I have already detected changes which are probably connected with

the sun-spot period.
    18, 19, 20. I have already detected changes.

I think these observations should be made over one of the 11 -year periods,

under absolutely the same conditions, with the same eyes and instruments, if

possible ; and even after that time I would rather extend the programme than
alter it. The value of each observation will be increased by each additional

similar observation.

Of course I expect the chemical end of the spectrum to be photographed.

Rutherford and Cornu have shown this to be perfectly feasible in the case of

18, 19, 20. I believe that time and money are alone wanted to do part of

all I have put down by photography. It will be an immense gain if this

Gcan be done from F, for the region between F and is terribly trying for

the eye. Up to F the eye must naturally be depended on.

   Of associated work there will be such researches as explain to us what the

various phenomena     mean                           measures of solar diameter                                                                                                                photographs of sun-
                                                  ;                                                                                                                                         ;

spots on a large scale ; and eye-observations with a fine instrument to deter-

mine whether the changes I have pointed out in the spectra and appearance

of sun-spots are connected with the sun-spot period.

I hope my accidental connexion with the new method of work will not

mycause me to be considered presumptuous if I state                                                                                                                                            opinion, that if it is

-- --Considered necessary to study the sun the fountain of all our energies at

all, whether for practical ends or for higher objects, the method of local
spectroscopic observation must not be neglected. I further believe, as I have
before stated, that it helps us where nothing else does, even if the photosphere
be alone considered ; and that, as we have above the photosphere a region of
greater delicacy, the continued study of this will lead us far beyond the
point we could hope to attain by merely observing the spots.

   While I hold these opinions most strongly, I must also add that I see no
way of having the work done by private effort. I have tried hard to continue
the work ; and in the fact that it was begun in this country by myself I had
the strongest inducement to carry it on ; but nothing short of one's whole

time will suffice for such inquiries.

    For the purpose of commencing action in this branch of science, your
Committee directed its Meteorological Subcommittee to put themselves into
communication with the Observational Establishments of the United Kingdom,
with a view of ascertaining from the directors of these establishments what
information besides that which they publish, they are willing to communicate
to men of science, and on what terms. This has been done with respect to

the four followi^nog institutions :

    1. The Royal Observatory, Greenwich.
   2. The Meteorological Committee.

   3. The Kew Observatory Committee.

   4. The Stonyhurst Observatory.

 --The following questions were put to the Astronomer Royal:

   1 Might men of science be permitted to inspect the traces of the Green-

wich self-recording instruments, especially those recording the changes in
terrestrial magnetism and those recording earth-currents, and to take notes
of them 1

    2. Could accurate copies of such traces be procured ? and on what terms 1
    3. Could accurate copies of the hourly tabulated values, taken from such
traces, be procured 1 and on what terms ?

   To these questions the following reply was received from the Astronomer

Royal :

 My --dear Sir, In reply to the questions which yon, acting with the

British-Association's Committee on Science-Lectures and Organization, have

placed before me (received this day), I have to answer as follows :
   1. It will give me great pleasure to offer every facility to any man of

science to see, examine, and take notes on all traces of self-recording in-
struments in this Observatory. I cannot very well allow the sheets to be
taken out of the Observatory, and should be glad if persons inspecting these
sheets would come at an early hour in the morning.

    2. Every facility shall be given for taking accurate copies of the records.
If a small' number only is required, we will at once have them made (when
the specific records are designated) without further trouble to our visitor ; if

a large number is wanted, some further arrangement may be necessary, on

which at present I cannot speak positively.
    3. Copies of the tabulated values shall be furnished to any practicable ex-
--504 REPORT 1873.

--tent limited as above, but not so closely, because copying figures is easier

than copying curves.

                         I am, my dear Sir,

Professor Roseoe.

   The Astronomer Royal was thanked in the name of the Committee for the
facilities which he was willing to give.

 --The following questions were put to the Meteorological Committee:

    1 Could accurate copies of the hourly tabulated values, taken from the

traces of the various self-recording instruments of the Meteorological Com-

mittee, be procured? and on what terms?

gicnl observations, or any other meteorological information in the possession
of the Meteorological Committee, be procured? and on what terms ?

 --Sir, In reply to your inquiries, I am instructed to inform you that the

Committee will be ready to afford to gentlemen recommended by the Council

of any recognized Scientific Body facilities for obtaining accurate copies of
MS. meteorological information which may be in their office.

1. Accurate copies of the hourly tabulated values taken from the traces

of their self-recording instruments can be supplied.

2. Accurate copies of portions of logs relating to meteorological observa-

tions and of other meteorological information in the Meteorological OflSce can

be supplied.
   In every instance the cost of copying must be defrayed by the applicant,

who, in the case of ships' logs, must state whether he prefers to have the

observations corrected, or to receive the correction, and apply them himself.

I am further to draw your attention to the fact that in the first Annual Re-

port of this Committee, at page 11, it was stated that copies of information

in the Meteorological Office could be supplied on the terms mentioned in the

enclosed circular, which are identical with those above mentioned. I may

say that several gentlemen have availed themselves of the opportunities offered,

                                   I am &c.,

   [A circular accompanied Mr. Scott's reply, in which it is stated that in

case of the publication of such information or of results wholly or in part
from it, an acknowledgment of the source from which it has been obtained
must be annexed.]

for the facilities which they were willing to give.

The following answer has been received :

 --Sir, With reference to your letter of March 25th, addressed to the Kew

Committee of the Royal Society, I am instructed to send you the following

reply, which was adopted at their meeting of the 31st ult. :

1 . Resolved, that the Committee will be ready to afford facilities to men of

science to inspect and take notes of the traces of the Self-recording Magneto-

graphs ; application to be forwarded in each case to the Secretary of the

Committee, in order that arrangements may be made for the attendance of a

duly authorized person.

   2 & 3. The furnishing of unpublished results of tabulations not onlv in-

volves considerable expense, but would materially disturb the current work

of the Observatory. The Committee are therefore not prepared at present to

supply copies of such results. They would, however, if necessary, gladly

supply photographic copies of the instrumental traces at the cost of produc-

tion, and they hope that this would meet the requirements of the case. In

all three cases the cost would depend on the amount of time and labour

required.

                                          Your obedient Servant,

                                          Robert H. Scott,

Professor H. E. Boscoe, F.R.S.                                    Hon. Sec.

The Kew Committee were thanked for their communication.

   The following questions were put to the Director of the Stonyhurst Ob-

servatory :

   1. Might men of science be permitted to inspect the traces of the Stony-
hurst self-recording magnetographs, and to take notes of them ?

    2, Could accurate copies of such traces be procured? and on what terms?

   The following reply has been received from the Director of the Stonyhurst

Observatory :

                                          Stonyhurst College, Blackburn.

                                                                                                              April 3rd, 1872.

  --Dear Sir, In answer to the two questions appended to the circular with

which you favoured me this morning, I have little else to say than that I

shall always be most happy to place at any gentleman's disposal the curves

traced by the Stonyhurst instruments. I am at present working systematically

at the tabulation of the magnetograph traces, and I hope to be able in time

to publish the results, but this will not in the least interfere with any man

of science recommended by your Committee taking any notes he may require.

    Accurate copies of the distinct curves can easily be taken photographically
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

the assistant's time and the materials used will be the only things charged

for. I could not undertake any thing that would deprive me of the aid of

myany of   assistants for any considerable time ; but a fair sacrifice I am quite

willing to make, and that is all I am sure you will expect.

                                          Yours sincerely,

Professor Roseoe.                                             S. J. Perrt.
--506 REPORT 1873.

    The Director of the Stonyhurst Observatory was thanked by the Com-

 mittee for the facilities which he was willing to give.

  --Subcommiitee C. On the question of Scientific Organization as regards

                                            Local Scientific Societies.

    Your Committee, believing that much valuable scientific effort is being lost

 throughout the country for want of a system by which the labours of isolated
 workers can be brought forward, appointed a Subcommittee, with Sir Walter
 Elliot as Secretary, for the purpose of discussing and reporting whether some
 means can be taken for establishing closer relations than at present exist
between Local Scientific Societies, which, as a rule, work independently each

in their own circle, with little knowledge of what others are doing. It is
thought that if such means can be adopted it may lead to something like

unity of action amongst them, and to investigations productive of general
 results, as well as to the iuterchange of views and observations advantageous
to Societies individually and to the cause of Science at large. The Subcom-

mittee point out that this end may be accomplished in two ways :
    1 By the publication annually, in a collected form, of observations or dis-

 coveries possessing general interest.

   2. By organizing a system of cooperation by personal or written com-

 munication, or both.

    The Subcommittee also suggest that delegates from certain selected So-

cieties, varying from year to year, together with representatives from such

Societies as may find it convenient to depute them, should meet along with
the British Association, and that to them should be submitted any general

questions of combined action or inquiry ; and that the Councils of Local
Scientific Societies should place in their hands such contributions made to the

Societies during the year as they may think it desirable to publish in a com-
mon volume of Reports, the Court of Delegates being possibly assisted by the
officers of Sections of the British Association acting along with them as a
Committee of Selection. Your Committee think it right here to observe that

all cost of publication and expenses incidental to such suggested Meetings
must be defrayed by the Societies concerned.

    After some preliminary discussions, the Subcommittee determined to com-
municate with as many of the Provincial Scientific Societies and Field Clubs
as possible, explaining the objects for which the Subcommittee was appointed,
and inviting them to consider the means by which the results of their opera-
tions could be made available to each other and to the advancement of

science at large.

    Circulars expressing the above-mentioned views were in June forwarded
to ninety-four English, twenty-two Scotch, and eight Irish Local Scientific
Societies. Replies cordially concurring in the plan have been received from
the following Societies, several likewise engaging to send delegates to Brighton
to deliberate further on its details :

      1. Bath Natural-History Society and Field Club.

      2. Bristol Natural-History Society.
      3. Eastbourne Natural-History Society.
      4. Folkestone Natural-History Society.

     5. Ludlow Natural- History Society.
     6. Ludlow Field Club.

      7. Lunesdale NaturaUsts' Field Club.

     8. Maidstone and Mid Kent Natural-History and Philosophical Society.
ON SCIENCE-LECTURES AND ORGANIZATION.  507

 9. Norfolk aud Norwich Natural-History Society.
10. Tamworth Natural- History and Geological Society.
1 1 Tyueside Naturalists' Field Club.
12. Northumberland, Durham, and Newcastle Natural-History Society.
13. Whitby Literary and Philosophical Society.
14. Largs (Scotland) Field Naturalists' Society.

   Acknowledgments have been sent by many more, promising that the sub-

ject shall receive their early attention.

   The Subcommittee find that proposals of a similar character to those which
they now put forward have previously been made by several Societies and
private individuals who have favoured them with communications. These
plans have, however, for one reason or other, proved abortive. Your Com-
mittee confidently hope that the Subcommittee on its reappointment may

succeed in carrying out the objects aimed at.

    In concluding what must inevitably be a very incomplete first Report,

your Committee have only to request that they may be reappointed, and to
express the hope that, if you see fit to renew their powers, they may be able
in the coming year to make further progress.

Report of Subcommittee A on Organization as regards Science-Lectures.

                                        (Prof. PbOscoE^ Secretary.)

  ASubcommittee on Science-Lectures have to report that a list has been

printed, for private circulation only, of gentlemen who have kindly intimated

to the Committee their readiness to undertake to aid the scheme by deliver-
ing lectures on scientific subjects on terms which are indicated. As certain
Members of the Committee are also wUling to deliver lectures, the names of
the Committee are appended.

  A short Circular, pointing out the aid which the Committee was thus

wUling to give, was forwarded (as a private communication) to about ninety
Scientific Institutions throughout the country, with an intimation that a
copy of the list of lecturers would be sent to any institution requiring assist-
ance of the kind. Owing to the death of Mr. Askham, the late Clerk, the
Secretary has been unable to learn the exact number of Institutions which
have made application for the aid of the Committee ; but, judging from the
numerous letters which he has received on the subject, he believes that the
action of the Committee in this matter has proved useful, and that the aid
which has thus been afforded appears to be generally appreciated.

     Report of Subcommittee B on Organisation as regards Meteorology.

                        (Dr. Balfour Stewart, Secretary.)

   At a meeting of this Subcommittee, held at Albemarle Street, it was re-
solved, " That in the opinion of the Committee it is desirable that the indivi-
dual observations in magnetism and meteorology, which at present exist,
should, as much as possible, be accessible to all those men of science who wish
to make use of them. They therefore request their Secretary (Dr. Stewart)

to put himself into communication with the Directors of the following British
and Colonial observational establishments, with a view of ascertaining,

" (1) What unpublished individual observations in magnetism and mete-

          orology they possess, specifying the most important.

" (2) On what terms, if any, will they consent to open them up to men of

           science desirous of obtaining copies of them.

--" British.  The  Meteorological  Committee ;  the Greenwich Observatory
                                                                                                                                                                           ;

Sir E. Sabine (Magnetieal Superintendent); the Scottish Meteorological

Society ; the Trinity House ; the Hudson-Bay Company.

  --" Colonial. The Observatory at Mauritius ; Cape of Good Hope ; Mel-

bourne ; Sydney ; Toronto ; Bombay ; Calcutta ; Madras."

   The various replies to this communication are given at length in an
appendix to this Report, and this Committee desire to express their thanks to
the Directors of the various establishments, who, in sending their replies,
have not only afibrded much information regarding their unpublished obser-
vations, but have likewise shown their willingness to open up these observa-

tions to men of science as much as possible *.

  * No communications have yet been addressed to foreign observatories.
   It is requested that any observer into whose hands this Keport may fall, and who may

have information he is willing to communicate, will have the goodness to forward the same

to Dr. Balfour Stewart, The Owens College, Manchester

  Report of Subcommittee C on Scientific Organization as regards Local
                  Societies. (Sir Walter Elliot, Secretary.)

    The Subcommittee have given their best consideration to the instructioua

of the Committee, to report as to a plan for the systematic publication of the
proceedings of local societies, with reference to the suggestion adopted at the
Meeting held at Brighton, viz. to incorporate in an annual volume such
papers as the societies considered worthy of reproduction, by means of a given

number of additional copies struck off for the purpose. It was further
added that the responsibility of selecting and publishing such papers as were
offered should not be undertaken by the Association.

    The chief difficulty to the elaboration of any such scheme is the financial
one. It has been found that none of the Provincial Societies are in a posi-
tion to contribute towards the cost, either of editing and publishing such
papers, or even of furnishing additional copies printed of a uniform size,
especially where, as often happens, they are accompanied by plates. It is

also found that the local publications are so irregular in appearing, that it

would be no easy matter to get a sufficient number together, to allow of their
being brought out in a volume simultaneously. Moreover some of the lead-
ing societies, especially those of which the Transactions have attained some

celebrity, object to the proposal, as tending to detract from the value of their

own publications.

    Besides the plan specially referred to them, the Subcommittee have con-
sidered other suggestions ; for example, the issue of a quarterly or monthly
magazine, containing the best papers of the various learned societies, not con-
fined to those of the provinces, with the titles of the rest, and a brief outline of
the proceedings of each. But this appears to go beyond the scope of the
Subcommittee's deliberations, and to belong rather to an independent pub-

lishing speculation.

   The Subcommittee, however, consider that a Handbook or List of Societies
might be prepared annually, showing the names and addresses of the office-
bearers of each, the day and place of meeting, and a list of the articles printed

during the past year.
    It is believed that by this means a closer intercourse would be induced

persons engaged in particular subjects of inquiry would be directed to sources

of information bearing on their own investigations, and those engaged in

similar pursuits would be led to assist each other.

   An intercourse so commenced will, it may be hoped, lead to more intimate

relations, and so bring about that larger cooperation and union which it is
the object of the Committee to promote.

   The Subcommittee beUeve that a Handbook of this description might be
produced at a moderate cost. From the general approval of some plan of
cooperation by the greater number of Provincial Societies, it is believed that
they would readily purchase such an annual, the moderate cost of which would
cover a part of the expenditure ; and it is recommended that the Committee

should apply to the Council for a small grant to cover the remainder.

   At the Brighton Meeting, it was intimated by a member for the Society

for Promoting Useful Knowledge, that if the Society resumed their publica-
tions they would probably aid in bringing out such a work.

   The following replies have been received from the various observational
institutions communicated with.

                     Meteorological Committee.

                                           Meteorological Office,

                                                    9th April, 1873.

Dear Sib,

   In compliance with the request contained in your letter of the 28th of

February, I am directed by the Meteorological Committee to enclose, for the

information of the Observational Subcommittee of the Science-Organization

Committee of the British Association, a list of the principal unpublished

materials in this office. It is understood that an answer to your second

question has been already given in my letter to Dr. Roscoe of April 30, 1872.

(See First Report.)              Yours faithfully,

                                 RoBEET H. ScoxT, Director,

Balfoiir Stewart, Esq., LL.D.,

The Owens College, Manchester.

   The tabulated information received from the Meteorological Committee
will be found at the end of this Appendix.

                     Greenwich Observatory.

                                 Eoyal Observatory, Greenwich, London, S.E.,
                                                         1873, March 3.

My deae Sir,

   In reply to your inquiry (on the part of the British Association) of March 1,
as to the extent of unpublished observations of magnetism and meteorology

preserved in this observatory :

   1. You wiU remark that the Greenwich Observations in extenso are in the

library of the Philosophical Society of Manchester. Referring you to these

volumes for the observations which are published, I will state the following

as the deficiencies, generally.

2. The eye-observations of the three magnetometers (declination, horizon-

tal force, vertical force) for every two hours, and sometimes more frequently,
from 1841 to part of 184S, are printed in full. The indications derived from

the photographic sheets for the salient points of the curves are printed in

full from 1849 to 1867 ; after 1867 they are printed in detail only for the
days of great disturbance, the means of the less disturbed days for useful

purposes being printed. All the photographic curves exist, furnished with

the base-lines and the time-scales, which make the records immediately

available.

   3. The means of numbers for all dips and measures of absolute force are

printed ; the individual readings are not printed.

    4. The abstracts of meteorological observations are printed to an extent

which you will best see in the Greenwich Observations. Few of the indivi-

dual numbers are published; but the sheets of the two anemometers, the

photographic sheets of the two thermometers (wet and dry), and of the

barometer are aU preserved and available.
   5. As to the terms on which observations can be communicated. The

omitted observations «S:c. can only be copied in manuscript at this place, either
           ON SCIENCE-LECTURES AND ORGANIZATION.  511

by the Officers of the Observatory, or by persons engaged to come here for
the purpose. \Micn limited extracts are required, I -will have them made

here at once. When the extracts required are long, T will give every

facility to other persons ; the expense then ought to be borne, I think, by

those who apply for them.

                                              I am, my dear Sir,

                             Yours very truly,

                                                  G. B. AiBT.

                             Edinburgh, 13th May, 1873.

Dear Sib,

Your letter of 28th February last, enclosing the resolution of the Observa-

tional Subcommittee of the Science-Organization Committee of the British

Association, dated 13th of the same month, was laid before the Council of
this Society at their Meeting of 28th ult.

In reply, the Council have instructed me to state that the more important

--of the unpublished individual Observations in Meteorology which this Society

possesses are the following :

   I. Eegular daUy observations made at the Society's Stations, beginning with
January 1857. The Stations at which the observations have been and are

--made are given in the successive Numbers of the Society's Proceedings the

last issued of which I send by this post. The Stations are given on pp. 334-
336 and 339-342. The nature of the observations wiU appear from the
specimen of the Society's Schedule sent herewith. The hours of observation
are 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. At Stykkisholm, in the N.W. of Iceland, the hours are
9 A.M., noon, and 9 p.m.

    In addition to the regular daily observations of atmospheric pressure,
temperature, humidity, wind (direction and force), rain, and cloud, obser-

vations are made at certain Stations on the temperature of the soil, of the
sea, and of wells, and on ozone. The Stations at which such observations
are made will be seen by consulting p. 329 of Journal sent.

    II. Observations for elucidation of special questions :

    1. Daily curves showing for every ten minutes the pressure, temperature
of dry and wet bulbs, and the rainfall from Nov. 1868 to Nov. 1872. The

self-registering instruments with which these curves have been made

were designed under the superintendence of the Marquis of Tweeddale, in
connexion with the growth of agricultural products.

   2. Observations, twelve times daily, at six Stations, on temperature of the
soil (3, 12, 22 inches deep), together with observations of pressure, tempera-
tur(% humidity, wind, rain, &c. during these four months, viz. July and Octo-
ber lb67, and January and April 1868.

    3. Observations on temperature of drained and undrained hill pasture,
and of drained and undrained arable land, at two Stations daily, from 1st
October 1864 to 30th September 1865.

   4. Daily maximum and minimum temperatures as shown by thermometers

(not blackened) fuUy exposed to the sun and weather, at 4 feet over old
grass, at eight Stations, from 1st April 1861 to 30th March 1862.
512 REPORT-- 1873.

  A5. large number of Term-day Observations (hourly) of temperature of

sea (Hebrides), together with observations of pressure, temperature, humi-

dity, &c. during lfe58-63.

   III. Old Eegisters :--

   1. From July 1767 to November 1827, at Gordon Castle, giving pres-

sure, temperature, rain, winds, &c. daily, and for shorter intervals during the
same period at Sion House, Edinburgh, Selkirk, &c.

    2. Daily register of pressure, temperature, and rain at Carbeth-Guthrie,
from January 1817 to December 1859.

    3. Daily register of pressure, temperature, humidity, rain, &c. at Dollar,
from April 1836 to present time.

 --A4. number of other weather registers, Edinburgh, 1820-36, Castle

Newe, 1836-47, &c.

   IV. Monthly Means and Sums :
   Of these may be specially mentioned the rainfall for individual months for
nearly the whole of 290 Stations, discussed in the Papers on the Scottish Eain-

fall in Society's Journal.

   As regards the unpublished meteorological information possessed by the
Society, the Coimcil have hitherto supplied copies of any portion of it to aU
meteorologists or other scientific men who have applied for it, free of charge.
The Council will still be glad to continue to do so in so far as the very limited
means at their disposal will enable them.

                                                                           I am, yours faithfully,
                                                                               Alexander Buchan.

     My DEAK Professor Stewart,

    I ought perhaps to have told you long before this what has been done in
regard to the Trinity House. In accordance with the desire of the Science-
Organization Committee, I put myself in communication with the Elder
Brethren about their meteorological records, and received the reply of which

I enclose a copy. You will see that in fully acceding to our request they
asked me to come and judge for myself as to the value of their records. On the

tirst convenient Tuesday I accordingly went to Tower Hill, and found that
they possessed most voluminous returns from all the Lighthouses, giving the
state of the barometer and thermometer, the direction and force of the vnnd,
with description of fog, cloud, &c. every three hours, drawn out on tabulated
forms, of which I send you one not fiUed up. At the Floating Lights a log-
book is kept, in which is entered very much the same particulars, but not so
frequently during the day, and not in a tabulated form.

    Captain Nisbet, the Chairman of the Light Committee, spoke to me about

the diiferences he had observed between the readings of different barometers

and his endeavour's to obtain the true correction for each. He has also tried

to get " fog-marks " set up at the same distance from the different light-
houses ; but at present there is no accepted definition as to where a " mist
           ON SCIENCE-LECTURES AND ORGANIZATION.                      513

ends and a *' fog " begins. He would be thankful to us for any suggestion

on these or other points.

   Erom the enclosed " Regulations " you will see that every Light-keeper on

being first appointed as a supernumerary has to learn the use of the meteoro-
logical instruments, and to obtain a certificate of competency in that and
other duties.

                                                                 Believe me,
                                                                      Very truly yours,
                                                                                    J. H, Gladstone.

Dear Sir,

Sir Frederick Arrow having placed your note of the 10th instant, with its

enclosed resolution of the Science-Organization Committee of the British

Association, before the Board, I am directed to assure you of the pleasure it

will be to the Elder Brethren to afford any facilities to men of science for the
inspection of the Trinity House meteorological records that may be compati-

ble with their oificial purpose ; and I am to suggest that if you can make it

convenient to attend here about half-past one o'clock on any Tuesday, the

Light Committee will be happy to go fully into the matter with you.

                             I am, dear Sir,

out the cost, and the next to raise the funds. The local government will be

applied to for a small annual grant. If we get the necessary assistance, there

need be no delay, as the greater part of the material is ready, all the meteoro-

logical observations having been reduced.

                                                     Yours truly,

Answers to the Questions of the Subcommittee of the Science Organization.

   (1) The unpublished observations, belonging either to the Mauritius
Observatory or to the Meteorological Society of Mauritius, are as foUows :

(a) Observations of the principal meteorological elements taken since the

1st January, 1853, at 3g and 9| a.m. and p.m., and also for several years at

noon.

Since the 1st January, 1872, the 3g a.m. observations have been discon-

tinued, and others taken at 6 a.m.

(6) Hourly meteorological observations on the 21st of each month, for a

period of nineteen years and also during hurricane weather.

(c) Barographic curves since February 1872.

(d) An extensivp collection of daily meteorological observations taken on

board ships in the Indian Ocean for a period of twenty-five years. Since 1853
these observations have been tabulated in chronological order. They aiford in-

formation respecting the atmospheric pressure and temperature, the direction

and force of the wind, the state of the weather and sea &c., and amount to about

250,676 of twenty-four hours each.

  A(e) separate collection of the details of the hurricanes, storms, and gales

which have taken place in the Indian Ocean since 1847.

  A(/) large number of daUy synoptic weather-charts of the Indian

Ocean for different periods since 1853, and charts showing the tracks of

hurricanes.

   (g) Observations of the absolute values and daily variations of the magnetic
elements since February 1872.

   (h) Sun-spot observations taken three or four times a week since 1869.

All these observations are valuable, but, considering the length of time

and the locality, I think the meteorological observations are the most valu-

able.

   (2) I have little doubt that the Observatory and the Meteorological Society

would consent to open up the observations to men of science, on condition of

their paying the esiiense of copying, and that they would, as far as possible,

give copies gratis. The best and cheapest way in the end, however, would pro-

bably be to publish the observations in extenso, and to distribute copies of
them. The Meteorological Society will do all in its power to accomplish this

object.

       My dear Sie,

   "With respect to your letter requesting copies of magnetical observations

which have been made here. Soon after I came here I hunted these records

up and completed their reductions, but the observations have not received my

final examination. I hope, however, to get them printed this year, when
copies shall be at once forwarded to you. I am sorry, however, to say that the

observations do not appear of great value. However, such as they are, you

will soon have the results.

                             Believe me,

                                                Yours very truly,

       My dear Sir,

I received your note and enclosure (resolution of the Observational Sub-

committee of the B.A.) by last mail, and I am very glad to find a step has

Webeen taken in this most important direction.  shall be only too glad to

make any arrangements we can to meet the end in view. I suppose, of

course, there wUl be some general scheme adopted in which we can join.

In the mean time I enclose a memorandum showing how our observations

in magnetism and meteorology now stand.

Since the beginning of 1872 we have published the results of meteorological

observations at Melbourne, and those of the stations in a more condensed

form ; copies of this monthly Record are, I believe, sent to you every month,

but I post another coi)y now in case I am mistaken. In this pamphlet you
will see we give the results of our monthly observations for the absolute

force of Terrestrial Magnetism.

   The question, how to make all these available to such men of science as may

wish to make use of them, is not easy to answer. Pentagraph or Photo copies
of all the graphic records could be furnished; and MS. copies of such un-

published other observations could also be made to be deposited in any con-

venient place that the Committee of the B. A. may decide upon. This, or

any other plan, I should be glad to adopt in order to render our work of use

and available. I shall be glad to hear what the Subcommittee recommend

myor decide upon, and I shall do  best to faU in with its views.

                                                  Yours faithfully,

   Between 1863 and the end of 18G7 occasional absolute determinations
were made with Lament's instruments, which are unpublished ; from De-
cember 1867 regular monthly absolute determinations were made with the

Kew instruments, which are not published to the end of 1871 ; also the

Magnetograph Curves are complete from December 1867, of which no results

are published.

Deae Sir,

I am in receipt of your letter 6th of March, enclosing a resolution of the

Subcommittee of the British Association.

I shall be glad to assist you in any waj^ I can.

   (1) Our magnetic observations are few; none were taken before Mr.
Smalley's arrival in 1864, and, with the exception of a few determinations

of variation and observations of dip at different parts of the colony, the rest

were found at his death to be wanting in some essentials for their reduction.

At the present time the press of work, astronomical and meteorological

(I have now more than forty stations), renders it impossible to do more than

take the variation, but 1 hope in a few weeks to have a Declination Magne-

tograph at work.

516 REPORT--1873.

   I send you a short paper read before our Eoyal Society, in which I brought

together all the available observations of variation at Sydney. So much may

be of interest to science, but the curves of daily variation were only added

for the use of our local survej'ors.

   I have a great mass of meteorological work, of which only monthly means
have been printed. I wUl by next mail send you a complete set of our pub-

lished results, from which you will be able to see what the means are derived

from, and whether any of the individual observations are likely to be of

service. Generally the country results are taken from one observation (per

day) at 9 a.m., and at Sydney from three observations, 9 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p.m.

   Of self-registering instruments we have an Aaiemometer at work since

1863, from which the direction of wind to sixteen points and the total velocity

and mean daily force of wind have been published.

  A Barograph at work since 1870 : mean daily and highest and lowest

readings published.

   Two Pluviometers, one 65 and the other 7 feet above the ground : monthly

amount from the one G5 feet high published. At work, one since 1867, the

lower one since 1870.

   Two Tide-gauges, one at Sydney since 1867, the other at Newcastle since

1870; no results published.

   (2) I cannot state on what terms they could be opened up to men of science
uutU I know what is wanted, for it may be only a fraction of what I have
mentioned would be of any use. I may say that if fifteen or twenty sets, such

as I vnR send you next month, wiU meet the want, I will be glad to send

them ; and if a portion only of the individual results are wanted, the Govern-
ment here might perhaps grant money to print them if asked to do so by the

British Association.                      Yours faithfully,

                                                 April 10, 1873.

Dear Sir,

I am in receipt of your letter of March 6, enclosing copy of resolution of

Subcommittee of Scientific Committee of British Association. The individual

observations made at Toronto are as follows :

 --Meteorological, from 1853 onwards. Six daily observations of the ordinary

elements  at 6, 8 a.m., 2, 4, 10, 12 p.m. ;  continuous record of the wind
                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

and during 1870-71 bihourly observations of the ordinary elements through

the 24 hours, on three days in the week.

Of the above, the observations at 6 a.m., 2 p.m., 10 p.m., with the means

of the six observations and the daily resultants of the wind for the whole

day, have been always published in the ' Canadian Journal.'

 --Magnetism Besides the regular monthly determinations of Declination,

Dip, and Horizontal Force, six observations of the Difi'erential Instruments

have been taken daily since 1856, at the hours above named. Throughout

the series, tiU recently, the disturbed observations have been sejmratcd and

grouped in the manner adopted by Sir E. Sabine.

tions have been published in three volumes to 1862, and others subsequently
in the Canadian journals. For reasons, chiefly financial, I have been hindered
from utilizing as I would wish the results of the Toronto observations, by

issuing regular and frequent publications of them. I am now, however,

printing a volume which will give the principal results derived from the
Toronto observations from their commencement to the end of 1871. This
^vill be followed, I hope, by regular annual volumes giving results of obser-
vations from all the Canadian stations.

   Though willing to regard it as a duty to do all in my power to meet the

wishes of your Committee, I think that it would be better to postpone any
decision on the second question in the resolution till the first of the volumes
shall have been printed.

                                                            I am, dear Sir,

Deab Sir,

In reply to your letter of the 6th March, I subjoin a list of the unpublished

observations in magnetism and meteorology at present in my possession.

                                             Magnetic Observations.
   Hourly readings of Magnetometers (Declination, Horizontal Force, and
Vertical Force) from 1865-0 to 1873-0.

   Photographic traces from Magnetographs :
                               Declination from 1870-5 to 1873-0.
                               Horizontal Force from 1870-7 to 1873-0.
                               Vertical Force from 1872-1 to 1873-0.

                                              Meteorological Observations.

   Hourly readings of Barometer, Dry and Wet Thermometei-s, Ground

Thermometers, and Eain-Gauges, estimation of wind and cloudiness, and
description of weather phenomena, from 1865-0 to 1873-0.

    Traces from Anemograph, direction and movement, from 1867-5 to

1873-0.

    Photographic traces from Barograph, from 1871-9 to 1873-0.

   Photographic traces from Thermograph (Dry and Wet Thermometers),

from 1872-0 to 1873-0.
   2. There is no present purpose of publishing the above in detail, but com-

pilations of results of meteorological and absolute magnetical observations are
published from time to time, the last volume issued including the years
1865 to 1870 and some discussion of special observations.

   The absolute magaetical observations of Declination, Horizontal Force,
and Dip are given in full detail.

   3. The reduction and discussion of the whole body of observations, mag-
netical and meteorological, collected since 1846, is in progress at the Kolaba

Observatory.
--518 REPORT 1873.

     I should mention too that up to the year 1864 similar hourly observations

  to those described were printed, forming twenty-one large 4to volumes, and
  distributed amongst scientific bodies ; but that little use seeming to have been
  made of them outside this observatory, the expense thus incurred, amounting

. to many thousands of pounds, represents, up to the present day, little more
 than so much waste. This statement I may observe reflects no discredit upon

  scientific men, seeing that the labour of reduction of such multitudinous ob-
 servations is utterly beyond the power of any individual. But I think it

 justifies fully the course which the Government are now pursuing in devoting

  a part of the funds formerly granted for publication to the eliciting, by the
 agency of the observatoiy itself, of some scientific conclusions from the obser-

  vations.

   4. With reference to the Committee's second inquiry, I beg to inform you

that I am jDermittcd by Government to supply copies of observations on the

same terms as those on which the Meteorological Committee of London

furnish copies of their records, viz. on condition that the applicant pays the

expense incurred in producing the copies. Any moderate demands that

would not seriously interrupt the regular work of the observatory, I should
gladly meet under this sanction.

                                              I remain,

Dr. Balfour Steivart, F.E.S.,                 Tours sincerely,

                                                       May 26, 1873.

Dear Sir,

   I understand, from the Report of the Proceedings of the Observational Sub-
committee of the Science-Organization Committee of the British Association,
that the Committee desires information what original meteorological registers
exist in this office which have not been published in detail. I append a list,

but would remark that many of the registers contain some entries which are

evidently erroneous. Copies of any of these that I consider trustworthy can
be furnislied to the British Association for the cost of copying.

   It obviously depends on the nature of the inquirer's object which of these

registers he would hold to be most important. In some respects I am inchned

to regard Darjeeling as the most important, since it affords, what is rare in
most parts of the world, a register (continuous for nearly six years) of a
station at an elevation of about 7000 feet. Goalparah, at the embouchure of
the Assam valley, is interesting for comparison with Darjeeling.

The most complete and detailed register extant in Bengal is that of the

Calcutta Observatory at the Surveyor- General's Office, which consists of
hourly observations recorded continuously since 1853. These are very
valuable, but are not equal to those of Bombay or Madi-as.

                         Believe me, dear Sir,

                                          Yours faithfuUy,

                                              Henry F. Blanford.

MISCELLANEOUS COMMUNICATIONS TO THE SECTIONS.

       MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS.

Address by Prof. H. J. S. Smith, M.A., F.B.S., President of tlie Section,

For several years past it has been the custom for the President of this Section, as

of the other Sections of the Association, to open its proceedings with a brief address.

I am not willing upon this occasion to deviate from the precedent set by my

predecessors, although I feel that the task presents peculiar difficulties to one who

IS by profession a pure mathematician, and who in other branches of science can

only aspire to be regarded as an amateur.

But although I thus confess myself a specialist, and a specialist it may be said

of a narrow kind, I shall not venture, in the few remarks which I now propose to

make, to indulge my own specialty too far.

I am well aware that we are certain in this Section to have a sufficient number

of communications which of necessity assume a special and even an abstruse

character, and which, whatever paius may be taken to give them clearness, and

however valuable may be the results to which they lead, are nevertheless extremely

difficult to follow, not only for a popular audience, but even for men of science

whose attention has not been specially and recently directed to the subject under

discussion. I should think it, therefore, almost unfair to the Section if, at the very

commencement of its proceedings, I were to attempt to direct its attention in any

--exclusive manner to the subject which I confess, if I were left to myself, I should

most naturally have chosen the history of the advances that have been made

during the last ten or twenty years in mathematical science. Instead, therefore,

of adventuring myself on this difficult course, which, however, I strongly recom-

mend to some successor of mine less scrupulous than myself, I propose, though at

the risk of repeating what has been better said by others before me, to offer some

general considerations which may have a more equal interest for all those who take

part in the proceedings of this Section, and which appear to me at the present time

to be more than usually deserving of the notice of those who desire to promote

the growth of the scientific spirit in this country. I intend therefore, while

confining myself as strictly as I can to the range of subjects belonging to this

Section, to point out out one or two, among many, of the ways in which sectional

meetings such as ours may contribute to the advancement of Science.

  We Aall know that Section of the British Association is the Section of Mathe-

matics and Physics ; and I dare say that many of us have often thought how

astonishingly vast is the range of subjects which we slur over, rather than sum up,
Wein this brief designation.
                              include the most abstract speculations of pure

mathematics, and we come down to the most concrete of all phenomena, the

most every-day of all experiences. I think I have heard in this Section a discussion

on spaces of five dimensions; and we know that one of our Committees, a Committee

<* REPORT 1873.

which is of long standing, and which has done much useful work, reports to us
annually on the Rainfall of the British Isles. Thus our wide range covers the
mathematics of numher and quantity in their most abstract forms, the mathematics

of space, of time, of matter, of motion, and of force, the many sciences which we
comprehend imder the name of astroncmy, the theories of sound, of light, heat,

electricity, and, besides the whole physics of our earth, sea, and atmosphere, the

theory of earthquakes, the theory of tides, the theory of all movements of the air,
from the lightest ripple that affects the barometer up to a cyclone. As I have
abeady said, it is impossible that communications on all these" subjects should be

interesting, or indeed intelligible, to                                   all  our  members                                              and  notwithstanding  the
                                                                                                                                      ;

pains taken by the Committee and by the Secretaries to classify the communications

offered to us, and to place upon the same days those of which the subjects are

cognate to one another, we cannot doubt that the disparateness of the material
which conies before us in this Section is a source of serious inconvenience to many
members of the Association. Occasionally, too, the pressure upon our time is
very great, and we are obliged to hurry over the discussions on communications of

great importance, the number of papers submitted to us being, of course, in a direct

proportion to the number of the subjects included in our progi-amme. It has again
and again been proposed to remedy these admitted evils by dividing the Section,

or at least by resolving it into one or more subsections. But I confess that I am
one of those who have never regretted that this proposal has not commended

Itself to the Association, or indeed to the section itself. I have always felt that

by so subdividing ourselves we should run the risk of losing one or two great

myadvantages which we at present possess; and I will briefly state what, in

judgment, these advantages are.

I do not wish to undervalue the use to a scientific man of listening to and

mmdtaking part in discussions on subjects which lie whollv in the direction in which
his own                                                has been working. But I think, nevertheless, that most men who

have attended a Meeting of this Association, if asked what they have chiefly gained

by It, would answer, in the first place, that they have had opportunities of forming

or of renewing those acquaintances or intimacies with other scientific men which,
to niost men engaged in scientific pursuits, are an indispensable condition of suc-

cessful work                                           and in the second  place, that while           they may have heard but little
                                                    ;

relating to their own immediate line of inquiry which they might not as easily have
found in journals or transactions elsewhere, they have learned much which might

otherwise have never come to their knowledge of what is going on in otlier

directions of scientific inquiry, and that they have carried away many new con-
ceptions, many fruitful germs of thought, caught perhaps from a discussion turning
upon questions apparently very remote from their own pursuits. An object just

perceptible on a distant horizon is sometimes better descried by a careless side-
ward glance than by straining the sight directly at it ; and so capricious a gift is

the inventive faculty of the human mind, that the clue to the mystery hid beneath
some complicated system of facts will sometimes elude the most patient and syste-

matically conducted search, and yet will reveal itself all of a sudden upon some

casual suggestion arising in connexion with an apparently remote subject. I

believe that the mixed character and wide range of our discussions has been most

favourable to such happy accidents. But even apart from these, if the fusion in
this Section of so many various branches of human knowledge tends in some degree
to keep before our minds the essential oneness of Science, it does us a good service.
There can be no question that the increasing specialization of the sciences, which

appears to be inevitable at the present time, does nevertheless constitute one great

source of danger for the future progress of human knowledge. This specialization

is inevitable, because the further the boundaries of knowledge are extended in any
direction, the more laborious and time-absorbing a process does it become to travel

to the frontier                                                        and thus the mind has neither  time  nor                          energy  to  spare  for the
                                                                    ;

purpose of acquainting itself with regions that lie far away from the trade over
which it IS forced to travel. And yet the disadvantages of excessive specialization
are no less evident, because in natural philosophy, as indeed in all things on which
the mind of man can be employed, a certain wideness of view is essential to the
achievement of any great result, or to the discovery of any thing reallv new. The
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                                d

twofold caution so often given by Lord Bacon against over-generalization on the

one hand, and against over-specialization on the other, is still as deserving as ever

of the attention of mankind. But in our time, v^^hen vague generalities and empty
metaphysics have been beaten once, and we may hope for ever, out of the domain of

exact science, there can be but little doubt on which side the danger of the natural

philosopher at present lies. And perhaps in our Section, as at present constituted,

there is a freer and fresher air ; we are, perhaps, a less inadequate representation
of '· that greater and common world " of which Lord Bacon speaks, than if we

were subdivided into as many parts as we include, I will not say sciences, but

groups of sciences. Perhaps there is something in the very diversity and multi-

plicity of the subjects which come before us which may serve to remind us of the

complexity of the problems of science, of the diversity and multiphcity of nature.

On the other hand, it is not, as it seems to me, difficult to assign the nature of

the unity which underlies the diversity of om- subjects, and which justities to a

very great extent the juxtaposition of them in our Section. That unity consists

not so much in the nature of the subjects themselves as in the nature of the

Amethods by which they are treated.  mathematician at least (and it is as a

mathematician I have the privilege of addressing you) may be excused for con-

tending that the bond of union among the physical sciences is the mathematical
spirit and the mathematical method which pervades them. As has been said with

profound truth by one of my predecessors in this chair, our knowledge of nature,

as it advances, continuously resolves difi'erences of quality into diflerences of

quantity. All exact reasoning (indeed all reasoning) about quantity is mathe-

matical reasoning ; and thus, as our knowledge increases, that portion of it which
becomes mathematical increases at a still more rapid rate. Of all the great subjects

which belong to the province of this Section, take that which at first sight is the

least within the domain of mathematics ; I mean meteorology Yet the part which
mathematics bears in meteorology increases every year, and seems destined to

increase. Not only is the theory of the simplest instruments of meteorology essen-

--tially mathematical, but the discussion of the observations upon which, be it

remembered, depends the hopes which are already entertained with increasing

confidence of reducing the most variable and complex of all known phenomena to

--exact laws is a problem which not only belongs wholly to mathematics, but

which taxes to the utmost the resources of the mathematics which we now possess.

So intimate is the union between mathematics and physics that probably by far

the larger part of the accessions to our mathematical knowledge have been

obtained by the efforts of mathematicians to solve the problems set to them by
experiment, and to create " for each successive class of phenomena a new calculus

or a new geometry, as the case might be, which might prove not wholly inadequate

to the subtlety of nature." Sometimes, indeed, the mathematician has been

before the physicist ; and it has happened that when some great and new qu.estion

has occurred to the experimentalist or the observer, he has found in the armoury

of the mathematician the weapons which he has needed ready made to his hand.

But much oftener the questions proposed by the physicist have transcended the

utmost powers of the mathematics of the time, and a fiesh mathematical creation

has been needed to supply the logical instrument reqidsite to interpret the new

enigma. Perhaps I may be allowed to mention an example of each of these two

ways in which mathematical and physical discovery have acted and reacted on

each othei". I purposely choose examples which are well known, and belong, the

one to the oldest, the other to the latest times of scientific history.

   The early Greek geometers, considerably before the time of Euclid, applied
themselves to the study of the various curve lines in which a conical figure may

--be cut by a plane curve lines to which they gave the name, never since forgotten,

of conic sections. It is difiicult to imagine that any problem ever had more
completely the character of a "problem of mere curiosity " than this problem of

the conic sections must have had in those earlier times. Not a single natural

phenomenon which in the state of science at that time could have been intelligently

observed was likely to require for its explanation a knowledge of the nature of

these curves. Still less can anj' application to the arts have seemed possible ; a
nation which did not even use the arch were not likelv to use the ellipse in anv

                                                                         i*

work of construction. The difficulties of tlie inquiry, the pleasure of grappling

with the unknown, the love of abstract truth, can alone have furnished the charm

which attracted some of the most powerful minds in antiquity to this research.

If Euclid and Apollonius had been told by any of their contemporaries that they

were giving a wholly wrong direction to their energies, and that, instead of

dealing with the problems presented to them by nature, they were applying their

minds to inquiries which not only were of no use, but which never could come to

be of any use, I do not know what answer they could have given which might not

now be given with equal or even greater justice to the similar reproaches which

it is not uncommon to address to those mathematicians of our own day who study

quantics of n indeterminates, curves of the nth. order, and, it may be, spaces of
n dimensions. And not only so, but for pretty near two thousand years the

experience of mankind would have justified the objection ; for there is no record
that during that long period which intervened between the first invention of the

conic sections and the time of Galileo and Kepler the knowledge of these curves

possessed by geometers was of the slightest use to natural science. And yet,

when the fulness of time was come, these seeds of knowledge, that had waited

so long, bore plentiful fruit in the discoveries of Kepfer. If we may use the

great names of Kepler and Newton to signify stages in the progress of human

discovery, it is not too much to say that without the treatises of the Greek

geometers on the conic sections there could have been no Kepler, without Kepler

no Newton, cand without Newton no science in our modern sense of the term,

or at least no such conception of nature as now lies at the basis of all our

science, of nature as subject in its smallest as well as in its greatest phenomena,

to exact quantitative relations, and to definite numerical laws.

Tills is an old story                                                                                         but it has always seemed to  me  to  convey a  lesson,  occa-
                                                                                                           ;

sionally needed even in our own time, against a species of scientific utilitarianism

which urges the scientific man to devote himself to the less abstract parts of

science as being more likely to bear immediate fruit in the augmentation of our

knowledge of the world without. I admit, howevei", that the ultimate good fortune

of the Greek geometers can hardly be expected by all the abstract speculations

which, in the form of mathematical memoirs, crowd the transactions of the learned

societies ; and I would venture to add that, on the part of the mathematician,

there is room for the exercise of good sense and, I would almost say, of a kind of

tact, in the selection of those branches of mathematical inquiry which are likely

to be conducive to the advancement of his own or any other science.

  I pass to my second example, of which I may treat very briefly. In the course

of the present year a treatise on electricity has been published by Professor Max-

well, giving a complete account of the mathematical theory of that science, as we

owe it to the labours of a long series of distinguished men, beginning with Coulomb,

and ending with our own contemporaries, including Professor Maxwell himself.

No mathematician can turn over the pages of these volumes without very speedily

convincing himself that they contain the first outlines (and something more than

the first outlines) of a theory which has already added largely to the methods and

resources of pure mathematics, and which may one day render to that abstract

science services no less than those which it owes to astronomy. For electricity

now, like astronomy of old, has placed before the mathematician an entirely new

set of questions, requiring the creation of entirely new methods for their solution,

while the great practical importance of telegraphy has enabled the methods of

electrical measurement to be rapidly perfected to an extent which renders their

accuracy comparable to that of astronomical observations ; and this makes it possi-
ble to bring the most abstract deductions of theory at every moment to the test of

fact. It must be considered fortunate for the mathematicians that such a vast field

of research in the application of mathematics to physical inquiries should be thrown

open to them at the very time when the scientific interest in the old mathematical

astronomy has for the moment flagged, and when the very name of physical astro-

nomy, so long appropriated to the mathematical development of the theory of gravi-

tation, appears likely to be handed over to that wonderful series of discoveries

which have already taught us so much concerning the physical constitution of the

heavenly bodies themselves.
                                                     TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                   5

Having now stated, from the point of view of a mathematiciau, the reasons

which appear to me to justify the existence of so composite an institution as Sec-

tion A, and the advantages which that very compositeness sometimes brings to

those who attend its meetings, I wish to refer very briefly to certain definite ser-
vices which this Section has rendered and may yet render to Science. Tlie im-

provement and extension of scientific education is to many of us one of the most

urgent questions of the daj' ; and the British Association has already exerted

itself more than once to press the question on the public attention. Perhaps

the time has arrived when some further eftbrts of the same kind may be desirable.

Without a rightly organized scientific education we cannot hope to maintain our

supply of scientific men, since the increasing- complexity and difficult}' of science

renders it more and more difficult for untaught men, by mere power of genius, to

force their way to the front. Every improvement, therefore, which tends to ren-

der scientific knowledge more accessible to the learner, is a real step towards the

advancement of science, because it tends to increase the number of well quali-

fied workers in science.

For some years past this Section has appointed a committee to aid the improve-

ment of geometrical teaching in this country. The Report of this committee wiU

be laid before the Section in due course ; and without anticipating any discussion

that may arise on that Report, I think I may say that it will show that we have

advanced at least one step in the direction of an important and long-needed reform.

The action of this Section led to the formation of an Association for the improve-

ment of geometrical teaching ; and the members of that Association have now

completed the first part of their work. They seem to me, and to other judges
much more competent than mj'self, to have been guided by a sound judgment in

the execution of their difficult task, and to have held, not unsuccessfully, a middle

course between the views of the innovators who would uphold the absolute

monarchy of Euclid, or, more properly, of Euclid as edited by Simson, and the
radicals who would dethrone him altogether. One thing at least they have not

forgotten, that geometry is nothing if it be not rigorous, and that the whole edu-

cational value of the study is lost if strictness of demonstration be trifled with.

The methods of Euclid are, by almost universal consent, unexceptional in point of

rigour. Of this perfect rigorousness his doctrine of parallels, and his doctrine of

proportion, are perhaps the most striking examples. That Euclid's treatment of

the doctrine of parallels is an example of perfect rigorousness, is an assertion
which sounds almost paradoxical, but which I nevertheless believe to be true.

Euclid has based his theory on an axiom (in the Greek text it is one of the postu-

lates ; but the difference for our purpose is immaterial) which, it may be safely said,
no unprejudiced mind has ever accepted as self-evident. And this uuaxiomatic
axiom Euclid has chosen to state, without wrapping it up or disguising it, not, for

example, in the plausible form in which it has been stated by Playfair, but in its
crudest shape, as if to warn his reader that a great assumption was being made.

This perfect honesty of logic, this refusal to varnish over a weak point, has had its

reward                                for it is one  of  the  triumphs  of modern geometry to  have  shown that the
                                   ;

eleventh axiom is so far from being an axiom, in the sense which we usually attach

to the word, that we cannot at this moment be sure whether it is absolutelv and

rigorously true, or whether it is a very close approximation to the truth. Two of

--those whose labours have thrown much light on this difficult theory are at present at

this Meeting Prof. Cayley, and a distinguished German mathematician, Dr. Felix

Klein                                 and I am sure of their adherence when I say that the sagacity and insio-ht of
                             ;

the old geometer are only put in a clearer light by the success which has attended the

attempt to construct a system of geometry, consistent witli itself, and not contradicted
by experience, upon the assumption of the falsehood of Euclid's eleventh axiom.

   Again, the doctrine of proportion, as laid down in the fifth book of Euclid, is
probably still unsurpassed as a masterpiece of exact reasoning, although the cum-
brousness of the forms of expression which were adopted in the old geometry has

led to the total exclusion of tliis part of the elements from the ordinary course of
Ageometrical education,
                                                              zealous defender of Euclid might add with truth that

the gap thus created in the elementary teaching of mathematics has never been

adequately supplied.
--'6 REPORT 1873.

    But after all has been said that can be said in praise of Euclid, the fact remains
that the form in which the work is composed renders it unsuitable for the earlier
stages of education. Euclid wn-ote for men, whereas his work has been used for

after more than 2000 years the experience of generations of teachers can suggest

changes which may make his 'Elements/ I will not say more perfect as a piece of
geometiy, but more easy for very young minds to follow. The dilficulty of a book

or subject is indeed not in itself a fatal obj ection to its use in education; for to learn

how to overcome difficulties is one gi-eat part of education. Geometry is hard, just
as Greek is hard ; and one reason why Geometry and Greek are such excellent edu-

cational subjects is precisely that they are hard. But in a world in which there is
80 much to learn, we must learn every thing in the easiest way in which it can be
learnt ; and after we have smoothed the way to the utmost of om- power there is
sure to be enough of difficulty left. I regard the question of some reform in the
teaching of elementary geometry as so completely settled by a great concurrence of
opinion on the part of the most competent judges, that I should hardly have
thought it necessary to direct the attention of" the Section to it, if it were not for

the following reasons :

   First, that the old system of geometrical instruction still remains (with but few
exceptions) paramount in our schools, colleges, and universities, and must remain so
until a very great consensus of opinion is obtained in favour of some one definite
text-book. It appears to me, therefore, that the duty will eventually devolve upon
this Section of the British Association, of reporting on the attempts that have been
made to frame an improved system of geometrical education ; and if it should be
found that these attempts have been at last successful, I think that the British
Association would lend the whole weight of its authority to the proposed change.

I am far from suggesting that any such decision should be made immediately. The

work undertaken by the Association for the improvement of geometrical teaching
is still far from complete ; and even when it is complete it must be left to hold its
own against the criticism of all comers before it can acquire such an amount of pub-

lic confidence as would justify us in recommending its adoption by the great teach-

ing and examining bodies of the country.
   Secondly, I have thought it right to remind the Section of the paii; it has taken

with reference to the reform of geometrical teaching, because it appears to me that
a task, at once of less difficulty and of more immediate importance, might now be
undertaken by it with gi-eat advantage. There is at the present moment a very

general agreement that a certain amount of natural science ought to be introduced
into school education ; and many schools of the country have akeady made most
laudable efforts in this direction. As far as I can judge, there is further a general
agreement that a good school course of natural science ought to include some part
or parts of physics, of chemistry, and of biology ; but I thiuk it will be found that
while the courses of chemistry given at om* best schools are in the main identical,
there is the greatest diversity of opinion as to the parts of physics and of biology

which should be selected as suitable for a school education, and a still greater di-
versity of opinion as to the methods which should be pursued in teaching them.

Under these circumstances it is not surprising to find that the masters of those
schools into which natural science has hardly as yet found its way (and some of the

largest and most important schools in the country are in this class) are doubtful as
to the course which they should take, and, from not knowing precisely what they

should do, have not as yet made up theii- minds to do any thing of importance.
There can be no doubt that the masters of such schools would be glad on these
points to be guided by the opinion of scientific men ; and I cannot help thinking
that this opinion would be more unanimous than is commonly supposed, and, further,
that no public body would be so likely to elicit an expression of it as a Committee
appointed by the British Association. I believe that, if such an expression of the
opmion of scientific men were once obtained, it would not only tend to give a right
direction to the study of natural science in schools, but might also have the eflect

of inducing the public generally to take a higher and more truthful view of the

objects which it is sought to attain by introducing natural science as an essential

element into all courses of education. All knowledge of natural science that is im-

parted to a boy, is, or may be, useful to him in the business of his after life ; but the

claim of natural science to a place in education cannot be rested upon its practical

usefulness only. The gxeat object of education is to expand and to train the mental

faculties ; and it is because we believe that the study of natural science is eminently
fitted to further these two objects, that we urge its introduction into school studies.

Science expands the minds of the young, because it puts before them great and
ennobling objects of contemplation ; many of its ti-uths are such as a child can under-
stand, and yet such that, while in a measure he imderstands them, he is made to

feel something of the greatness, something of the sublime regularitj', and of the im-

penetrable mystery of the world in which he is placed. But science also trains

the g^'owing faculties; for science proposes to itself truth as its only object, and it

presents the most varied and at the same time the most splendid examples of the

different mental processes which lead to the attainment of truth, and which make up

what we call reasoning.  In science error                                                                                                                   is always possible, often  close at  hand

and the constant necessity for being on our guard against it is one important part

of the education which science supplies. But in science sophistry is impossible ;

science knows no love of paradox                                                                                                                            science has no skill to make the worse appear the

better reason ; science visits with a not long-deferred exposure all our fondness for

preconceived opinions, all our partiality for views that we have ourselves maintained,

--and thus teaches the two best lessons that can well be taught on the one hand the

love of truth, and on the other sobriety and watchfulness in the use of the under-

standing.

   In accordance with these views I am disposed to insist very strongly on the im-
portance of assigning to physics (that is to say, to those subjects which we discuss
in this Section) a very prominent place in education. From the great sciences of

observation, such as botany, or zoology, or geologj', the young student learns to

observe, or, more simply, to use his eyes ; he gets that education of the senses which
is after all so important, and which a purely grammatical and literary education so

wholly fails to give. From chemistry he learns, above all things, the art of experi-

menting, and experimenting for himself. But from physics, better as it seems to

me than from any part of science, he may learn to reason with consecutiveness and

precision from the data supplied by the immediate observation of natural phe-

nomena. I hope we shall see the time when each successive portion of mathe-

matical knowledge acquired by the pupil will he made immediately available for his

instruction in physics, and when every thiug that he learns in the physical

laboratory will be made the subject of mathematical reasoning and calculation. In
some few schools I believe that this is already the case ; and I think we may hope
well for the future both of mathematics and physics in this country when the

practice becomes universal. In one respect the time is favourable for such a

revolution in the mode of teaching physical science. During the past few years a

number of text-books have been made available to the learner which far surpass

any thing that was at the disposal of former generations of pupils, and which are

probably as completely satisfactory as the present state of science will admit. It is

pleasant to record that these text-books are the work of distinguished men who

Wehave always taken a prominent part in the proceedings of this Section.                                                                                                                         have

Deschanel's 'Physics,' edited, or rather rewritten, by Prof Everett, a book remark-

able alike for the clearness of its explanations and for the beauty of the engravings
with which it is illustrated ; and, passing to works intended for students somewhat

further advanced, we have the treatises of Prof. Balfour Stewart on heat, of Prof.
Clerk Maxwell on the theory of heat, of Prof. Fleeming Jenkin on electricity, and we

expect a similar threatise on light from another of our most distinguished members.
   These works breathe the very spirit of the method which should guide both

research and education in physics. They express the most profound and far-

reaching generalizations of science in the simplest language, and yet with the

utmost precision. With the most sparing use of mathematical technicalities, they

are a perfect storehouse of mathematical ideas and mathematical reasonings. An old

French geometer used to say that a mathematical theory was never to be considered

complete till you had made it so clear that you could explain it to the first man you

met in the street. This is of course a brilliant exaggeration ; but it is no exaggera-

tion to say that the eminent writers to whom I ha%e referred have given something

of this clearness and completeness to such aljstract mathematical theories as those

of the electrical potential, the action of capillaiy forces, and the definition of absolute

Atemperature.    great object will have been attained when an education in physi-

cal science on the basis laid down in these treatises has become generally accepted

in our schools.

I do not wish to close this Address without adverting, though only for one

--moment, to a question which occupies the minds of many of the friends of science

at the present time the question. What should be the functions of the State in

supporting or organizing scientific inquiry ? I do not mean to touch on any of

the difficulties which attend tliis question, or to express any opinion as to the con-

troversies to which it has given rise. But I do not think it can be out of place for

the President of this Section to call your attention to the inequality with which,

as between different branches of science, the aid of Government is afforded. Na-

tional observations for asti'onomical purposes are maintained by this as by every

civilized country. Large sums of money are yearly expended, and most rightly

expended, by the Government for the maintenance of museums and collections of
mineralogy, botany, and zoology. At a veiy recent period an extensive chemical

laboratory, with abundant appliances for research as well as for instruction, has

--been opened at South Kensington. But for the physical sciences such sciences
--as those of heat, light, and electricity nothing has been done ; and I confess I do

not think that any new principle would be introduced, or any great burden

incurred, capable of causing alarm to the most sensitive Chancellor of the

Exchequer, if it should be determined to establish, at the national cost, institutions

for the prosecution of these bi-anches of knowledge, so vitally important to the

progress of science as a whole. Perhaps, also, upon this general ground of fairness>

even the pure mathematicians might prefer a modest claim to be assisted in the

calculation and printing of a certain number of Tables, of which even the physical

applications of their science are beginning to feel the pressing need.

One word fm-ther on this subject of State assistance to science, and I have done.

It is no doubt true that for a gi'eat,. perhaps an increasing, number of pui-poses

science requires the assistance of the State ; but is it not nearer to the truth to say

mythat the State acquires the assistance of science ? It is  conviction that if the

true relations between science and the State are not recognized, it is the State, rather

than science, that will be the gi-eat loser. Without science the State may build a
ship that cannot swim, and may waste a million or two on experiments, the futile

result of which science could have foreseen. But without the State science has

done very well in the past, and may do very well in time to come. I am not sure
that we should know more of pure mathematics, or of heat, of light, or electricity
than we do at this moment if we had had the best help of the State all the time.

There are, however, certain things which the State might do, and ought to do, for

science. It, or corporations created by it, ought to undertake the responsibility of

carrying on those great systems of observations which, having a secular character,

cannot be completed Mathin the lifetime of a single generation, and therefore cannot

be safely left to individual energy. One other thing the State ought to do for
science. It ought to pay scientific men properly for the services which they render

directly to the State, instead of relying, as at present, on their love for their work
as a means of obtaining their services on lower terms. If any one doubts the justice
of this remark, I would ask him to compare the salaries of tlae officers in the British
Musevmi with those which are in other departments of the Civil Service.

   But what the State cannot do for science is to create the scientific spirit or to
control it. The spirit of scientific discovery is essentially voluntary ; voluntarj^,

and even mutinous, it will remain : it will refuse to be bound with red tape, or rid-

den by officials, whether well meaning or perverse. You cannot have an Estab-
lished Church in science ; and if you had, I am afraid there are many scientific men
who would turn scientific nonconformists.

   I venture upon these remarks because I cannot help feeling that the gi-eat desire

which is now manifesting itself on the part of some scientific men to obtain for
science the powerful aid of the State may perhaps lead some of us to forget that it

is self-reliance and self-help which have made science what it is, and that these are

the qualities the place of wnich no Government help can ever supply.

                                     On the Mercator's Projection of a Surface of Revolution.
                                                       By Prof. Catlet, F.B.S.

The theory of Mercator's projection is obviously applicable to any surface of re-

volution ; the meridians and parallels are represented by two systems of parallel lines

at right angles to each other, in such wise that for the infinitesimal rectangles in-

cluded between two consecutive arcs of meridian and arcs of parallel the rectangle

in the projection is similar to that on the surface. Or, what is the same thing, drawing

on the surface the meridians at equal infinitesimal intervals of angular distance, we
may di-aw the parallels at such intervals as to divide the siu-face into infinitesimal

squares ; the meridians and parallels are then in the projection represented by two

systems of equidistant parallel lines dividmg the plane into squares. And if the

angidar distance between two consecutive meridians instead of being infinitesimal

is taken moderately small (5° or even 10°), then it is^easy on the surface or in piano,

using only the curve which is the meridian of the surface, to lay down graphically

the series of parallels which are in the projection represented by equidistant parallel

lines. The method is, of course, an approximate one, by reason that the angular

distance between the two consecutive meridians is finite instead of infinitesimal.

   I have in this way constructed the projection of a skew hyperboloid of revolu-

     _

tion : viz. in one figure I show the hyperbola, which is the meridian section, and

=by means of it (taking the interval of "the meridians to be 10'^) constnict the posi-

tions of the successive parallels ; I complete the figure by drawing the hyperbolas

which are the orthographic projections of the meridians, and the right lines which

are the orthographic projections of the parallels ; the figure thus exhibits the ortho-

graphic projection (on the plane of a meridian) of the hyperboloid divided into

squares as above. The other tigiu-e, which is the Mercator's projection, is simply
two systems of equidistant parallel lines dividing the paper into squai-es. I remark

that in the first figure the projections of the right lines on the surface are the tan-

gents to the bounding hyperbola ; in particular, the projection of one of these lines

is an asymptote of the hyperbola. This I exhibit in the figure, and by means of it

trace the Mercator's projection of the right line on the surface ; viz. this is a ser-

Sentine curve included between the right lines which represent two opposite meri-

ians and having these lines for asymptotes. It is sufficient to show one of these

curves, since obviously for any other line of the surface belonging to the same

system the Mercator's projection is at once obtained by merely displacing the curve

mparallel to itself, and for any line of the other system the projection is a like curve
     a reversed position.

    Mercator's projection mi^ht be made of a skew hyperboloid not of revolution
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

viz. the ciuT^es of curvature might be drawn so as to divide the suiface into squares,

and the cui-ves of curvature be then represented by equidistant parallel lines as

above ; and the construction would be only a little more difficult. The projection
presented itself to me as a convenient one for the representation of the geodesic

lines on the surface, and for exhibiting them in relation to the right lines of the

surface                              but I have not yet worked this  out.  In conclusion, it may be remarked
                                  ;

that a surface in general cannot be divided into squares by its curves of curvature,

but that it may be in an infinity of ways divided into squares by two systems of

curves on the surface, and any such system of curves gives rise to a Mercator's

projection of the surface.

On the Introduction of the Decimal Point into Arithmetic.
                 By J. W. L. GiAisHEE, B.A.

The following is an extract from Peacock's excellent history of Arithmetic in

the ' Encyclopaedia Metropolitana,' which forms the standard (not to say the only)

--work on the subject. Speaking of Stevinus's 'Arithmetique,' Peacock wi-ites:

We" find no traces, however, of decimal arithmetic in this work ; and the first

notice of decimal, properly so called, is to be found in a short tract which is put

at the end of his ' Arithmetique ' in the collection of his works by Albert Girard,

entitled 'La Disme.' It was first published in Flemish, about the year 1590, and

afterwards translated into barbarous French by Simon of Bruges .... Whatever

advantages, however, this admirable invention, combined as it still was with the

addition of the exponents, possessed above the ordinary methods of calculation in

the case of abstract or concrete fractions, it does not appear that they were readily

mperceived or adopted by his contemporaries            The last and final' improvement

this decimal Arithmetic, of assimilating the notation of integers and decimal

fractions, by placing a. point or comma between them, and omitting the exponents

altogether, is unquestionably due to the illustrious Napier, and is not one of the

least of the many precious benefits which he conferred upon the science of cal-
culation. No notice whatever is taken of them in the * Mirifici Logarithmorum

Canonis Descriptio,' nor in its accompanying tables, which was published in 1614.

In a short abstract, however, of the theory of these logarithms, with a short

table of the logarithms of natural mmibers, which was published by Wright,

1616, we find a few examples of decimals expressed with reference to the deci-

mal point ; but they are first distinctly noticed in the ' Rabdologia,' which was

published in 1617. In an ' Admonitio pro decimal! Arithmetica 'he mentions in

terms of the highest praise the invention of StcAdnus, and explains his notation

and, without noticing his own simplification of it, he exhibits it in the follow-

ing example, in which it is required to divide 861094 by 432  The quotient is

1993,273 or 1993,27"3"', the form under which he afterwards writes it, in partial
14 REPORT 1873.

conformity with the practice of Stevinus. The same form is adopted in an ex-
ample of abbreviated multiplication which subsequently occurs .... The preceding

statement will sufficiently explain the reason why no notice is taken of decimals

in the elaborate explanations which are given by Napier, Biiggs, and Kepler, of

the theory and construction of logarithms; and indeed we tiud no mention oi
them in any English author between 1(319 and 16.31. In that year the 'Loga-
rithmicall Arithmetike ' was published by Gellibrand and other friends of Briggs
(who died the year before), with a much more detailed and popular explanation
of the doctrine of logarithms thau was to be found in the ' Aritlimetica Loga-
rithmica.'. . . .From this period we may consider the decimal Arithmetic as fully

established, inasmuch as the explanation of it began to form an essential part of
all books of practical arithmetic. The simple method of marking the separation
of the decimals and integers by a comma, of which Napier has given a solitary
example, was not, however, generally adopted."

  --De Morgan ('Arithmetical Hooks,' 1847, p. xxiii) writes : " Dr. Peacock mentions

is the person who first made this distinction a permanent language, not using it
merely as a rest in a process, to be useful in pointing out afterwards how another

process is to come on or language is to be applied, but making it his final and
permanent indication as well of the way of pointing out where the integers end
and the fractions begin, as of the manner in which that distinction modifies opera-
tions. Now, first, I must submit that Napier did not do this ; secondly, that if
he did do it, Richard Witt did it before him."

   De Morgan then states that he has not seen Wright's translation of 1616 ; but he
proceeds to examine Napier's claim as resting on the two examples in the ' Rab-

--dologia,' in the first of which a comma is used, but only in one place. After

this examination he proceeds : " I cannot trace the decimal point in this ; but if

required to do so, I can see it more distinctly in Witt, who published four years
before Napier. But I can hardly admit him to have arrived at the notation of

the decihial point. ..." *

   I agree with De Morgan in all that he has stated in the above extracts, and
do not think that the single instance of the comma used in the course of work,

and replaced immediately afterwards by exponential marks, is a sutlicieut ground
for assigning to Napier the invention of the decimal point, or even afibrds a pre-
sumption that he made use of it at all in the expression of results.

    StiU one of the objects of this paper is to claim (provisionally, of course, till
evidence of any earlier use is produced, if such there be) the invention of the
decimal point for Napier, but not on account of any thing contained in the ' Rab-

dologia.' The mathematical works published by Napier in his lifetime (he died
in 1617) were his 'Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio,' 1614, containing
the first announcement of the invention of logarithms, and the ' Rahdologia,'
1617, giving an accoimt of his almost equally remarkable (as it was thought at
the time) invention of numbering rods or "bones." In 1619, two years after his
death, the ' Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Constructio,' containing the method of
construction of the canon of logarithms, was published, edited by his son ; and in
this work the decimal point is systematically used in a manner identical with
that in which we employ it at the present day. I can find no traces of the decimal
point in Wright's [translation of the ' Descriptio,' 1616 ; and, as De Morgan says,
the use of the decimal separator is not apparent in Witt. The earliest work,
therefore, in which a decimal separator was employed seems to be Napier's

--posthumous work the ' Constructio' (1619), where the following definition of the

point occurs on p. 6: "In numeris periodo sic in se distinctis, quicquid post
periodum notatur fractio est, cujus denominator est unitas cum tot cyphrispost se,

   * In an essay "On some points in the history of Arithmetic" (Companion to the

Almanac for 1851), De Morgan lias fiu-ther discussed the invention of the decimal point,
but in the same spirit as regards Napier. He seems never to have seen Napier's ' Con-
structio' of 1619 ; and the work is very rare. The only copy I have been able to see is

that in the Cambridge University Library.

and tlie result found to be 33-774432 ; and on pp. 23 and 24 occur decimals not

attached to integers, viz. -4999712 and -0004950. These show that Napier was

in possession of all the conventions and attributes that enable the decimal point

to complete so symmetrically our system of notation, viz. (1) he saw that a point

or separatrix was quite enough to separate integers from decimals, and that no

signs to indicate primes, seconds, &c. were required                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         (2) he used  ciphers after the

decimal point and preceding- the first significant figure ; and (3) he had no objec-

tion to a decimal standing by itself without any integer. Napier thus had com-

plete command over decimal fractions, and understood perfectly the nature of the

decimal point ; and I believe (except, perhaps, Briggs) he is the first person of

whom this can be said. When I first read the ' Constructio ' I felt some doubt

as to whether Napier really appreciated the value of the decimal point in all its

bearings, as he seemed to have regarded it to some extent as a mark to separate

figures that were to be rejected from those that were to be retained ; but a careful

examination has led me to believe that his views on the subject were pretty nearly
identical with those of a modem arithmetician. There are perhaps 200 decimal

points in the book, afibrding abundant evidence on the subject.

The claim of Napier to the invention of the decimal point is not here noticed

for the first time, as both Delambre (' Hist, de I'Astron. mod.,' t. i. p. 497) and
Hutton allude to the decimal fractions in the ' Constructio ' (though the latter
claims priority for Pitiscus), and Mr. Mark Napier (' Memoirs of John Napier,'

p. 454) devotes a good deal of space to it.

Briggs also used decimals, but in a form not quite so convenient as Napier.

Thus  he writes 63-0957379  as  630957379                                           viz.                                         he prints a bar under                                                                                                                                                    the decimals
                                                                                 ,

this notation first appears, without any explanation, in his ' Lucubrationes,' ap-
pended to the * Constructio " *. Briggs used this notation all his life (he died in
1631), and he explains it in the ' Arithmetica Logarithmica ' of 1624. Oughtred's
symbol, first used (as far as I know) in his ' Arithmeticse in numeris . . . Clavis,'

1631, dittered only from Briggs 's in the insertion of a vertical bar to separate the

--decimals from the integers more completely thus, 63j 0957379. Oughtred's and

Briggs's notations are essentially the same, the improvement of the former being

no doubt due to the uncertainty that sometimes might be felt as to which was

the first figui-e above Briggs's line. From an inspection of MSS. of Briggs and

Oughtred (the Birch MSS. contain abetter of Briggs to Pell ; and the Royal Society

has a Peter Ramus, with many of his MS. notes, while the Cambridge University

copy of the ' Constructio ' is annotated in MS. by Oughtred) it is apparent that,

in writing, Briggs and Oughtred both made the separating rectangle in exactlv

the same way ;  viz.  they wrote it 6t: 095 7379,                                                                                the  upright                                                                                                                                                mark  usually being  just
                                                                                                                              [

high enough to fix distinctly what two figures it was intended to separate, and they

rarely took the trouble to continue the horizontal line to the end of the decimals

if there were many. Thus Oughtred was a follower of Briggs, and only made an

improvement in the printed notation. It is clear that, in writing, Briggs's rect-

angle was pretty nearly as convenient as Napier's point ; and there is every proba-

bility that Briggs appreciated all the properties of the " separatrix " as clearly as

Napier ; but in his 8 pp. of ' Lucubrationes ' he has left much less to judge by than
has Napier. In 1624, as we can see from his ' Arithmetica Logarithmica,' he had

full command over decimal arithmetic in its present form (except that he used

the rectangular " separatrix " instead of the point. Gunter was a follower of

Napier, and employed the point (but see De Morgan). In his 'Description and

use of the Sector' (1623) he uses the point throughout pretty much as we do at
present (e. g. p. 40 of the ' First Booke of the Crosse-Staffe,' "As 4-50 unto 1-00 : so

1-000 unto 0-222 "), except that he called the decimals parts in the text. In Roe's

   A* curious blunder is made in Bartholomew Vincent's reprint of the ' Constructio,'

Lyons, 1620 (of which there is a copy in the Royal Society's Library). The printer, un-
aware that the position of Briggs's subscript rules had any meaning, has disposed them
symmetrically under all the figures.
16 REPORT 1873.

< Tabulae Logarithmicae, or Two Tables of Logaritlimes ' (1633), the explanatory-

portion of whicli was written by Wingate, decimal points are used everywhere

thus we have (p. 29) " As 1 is to "OZOSTS : so is the square of the circumference to

the superficiall Content;" and he takes the case of circumference 88*75, and

obtains by multiplication (performed by logarithms) 626-8 for the result. Wingate

refers for explanation on the decimal point to his 'Arithmetic ; ' but I have not seen

any edition of this work that was published previously to Roe's tables (Watt gives

one 1630). In his ' Construction and Use of the Line of Proportion,' 1628, Wingate

also uses decimals and decimal points.

On the whole, therefore, it appears that both Napier and Briggs saw that a

mere separator to distinguish integers from decimals was quite sufficient without

any exponential marks being attached to the latter--but that Napier used a simple

point for the purpose, while Briggs employed a bent or curved line, for which in

--print he substituted merely a horizontal bar subscript to the decimals that Gunter

and Wingate followed Napier, while Oughtred adopted Briggs's method and made

an improvement in the mode of printing it. Napier has left so many instances

of the decimal point as to render it pretty certain that he thoroughly appreciated

its use ; and there is every reason to believe that Briggs had (in 1619) an equal

command over his separator, although there are not enough printed instances of

that date to prove it so conclusively as in Napier's case (there is no instance in

the * Lucubrationes ' in which a quantity begins with a decimal point ; and there

could not well be one). Napier did not use the decimal point in the 'Descriptio'

(1614), nor in his book of arithmetic, first printed under the editorship of Mr.

Mark Napier in 1839 ; and there is only the single doubtful case in the ' Rabdo-

logia,' 1617 ; so that there is reason to believe that he did not regard it as generally

applicable in ordinary arithmetic. The only previous publication of Briggs's that

I have seen is his ' Chilias,' 1617, which contains no letterpress at all. The

fact that Napier and Briggs use different separating notations is an argument

against either having been indebted to the other, as whoever adopted the other's

views would probably have accepted his separator too. It is doubtful whether, if

Napier had written an ordinary arithmetic at the close of his life, he would have

used his decimal point. Wingate employed the point with much more boldness,

and regarded it much more in the light of a permanent symbol of arithmetic

than did (or could) Napier. The Napierian point and the Briggian separator

differ but little in writing ; and as far as MS. work is concerned it is quite easy to

see why many should  have  considered the  latter  preferable                                                 for  it was clear, and
                                                                                                           ;

Ainterfered with no existing mark.      point is the simplest separator possible ; but

it had already another use in language. In all the editions of Oughtred's ' Clavis *

(which work held its ground till the beginning of the last century) the rectangular

separator was used ; and it is not unlikely that it was ultimately given up, for the

same reason as that which I believe will lead to the abandonment of the similar

sign now used in certain English books to denote factorials, viz. because it was

troublesome to jrrint. But be this as it may, it is not a little remarkable that the

first separator used (or, more strictly, one of the first two) should have been that

which was finally adopted after a long period of disuse. All through the seven-

teenth century exponential marks seem to have been common, on which see the

accounts in Sir Jonas Moore's * Moor's Arithmetick,' London, 1660, p. 10, and

Samuel Jeake's 'Compleat Body of Arithmetick,' London, 1701 (written in 1674),
p. 208, which are unfortunately too long to quote in this abstract.

In his account Peacock is inaccurate in saying that the ' Logarithmicall Arith-

metike' was published by Gellibrand and others, the mistake having arisen no

doubt from a confusion with the ' Trigonometria Britannica,' ] 633 ; and in any

case the reference is not a good one, as the ' Arithmetike ' of 1631 shows (for

reasons which must be passed over here) a less knowledge of decimal arithmetic

than do any of the chief logarithmic works of this period. Also Briggs died in

1631, not 1630.

There is no doubt whatever that decimal fractions were fh'st introduced by Ste-

vinus in his tract ' La Disme.' De Morgan (' Arithmetical Books,' p. 27) is quite

right in his inference that it appeared in French in 1585 attached to the 'Pratique

Ad'Arithm^tique.'    copy of this work (1585) with 'La Disme' appended is now

in the British Museum. On the titlep.age of the 'Disme ' are the words "Preniiere-
ment descripte en Flameng, & maintenant conuertie en Francois, par Sinidn Stevin

de Bruges." These words, appearing also in Albert Girard's collected edition of

Stevinus's works (1634), no doubt gave rise to De Morgan's inference that " the

method of decimal fractions was announced before 158o in Dutch." The Cambridge

University Library possesses a 1585 copy entitled " De Thiende . . . Beschreven

door Simon Stevin van Brugghe  Tot Leyden, By ChristoHel Plautijn,

M.D.LXXXV " (privilege dated December 20, 1.584) ^ and there seems every reason

to believe, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that this was the first

edition of this celebrated tract. Peacock's statement that " it was first published

in Fleniish about the year 1590, and afterwards translated into Ijarbarous French

by Simon of Bruges," is also, I suspect, founded on no other evidence than the

sentence on the titlepage of the 'Disme,' which appears also in Girard. De

Morgan rightly remarks that Simon of Bruges is Stevinus himself, but he cannot

tell whence Peacock derived the date 1-590. It is probable that it was merely a

rough estimate obtained bj^ considering tlie dates of the other works of Stevinus.

Stevinus's method involved the use of his cumbrous exponents : thus he wrote

27-847 as ^1  8 (T) 4 (V) 7 (¥) , and read it 27 commencements, 8 primes,

4 seconds, 7 thirds ; and the question chiefly noticed in tliis abstract is the conside-
ration of who first saw that, by a simple notation, the exponents might be omitted,
and introduced this abbreviation into arithmetic.

   Napier's ' liabdologia ' was translated into several languages soon after its ap-
pearance ; and I have taken some pains to examine the different ways in wliich the
translators treated the example which Peacock regarded as the first use of the

decimal point, as we can thereby infer something with regard to the state of

decimal arithmetic in the different countries. Napier (1617) wrote 199.3,273 in
the work and 1993,2'7"3"' in the text. In Locatello's translation (Verona, 1623)

this is just reversed, via. there is 1993.2'7"3"' in the work and 1993,273 in the text.

The Lyons edition (1626) has 199-3,273 in the work and 199-3,2 (T) 7 (s) 3 (s)
in the text, while De Decker's edition (Gouda, 1626) has 1993,273 in the work,

and in the text 1993 (o^ 2 (T) 7 (2^ 3 (S^ , the last being exactly as Stevinus

would have written it. Ursinus's ' Rhabdologia Neperiana,' Berlin, 1623, is not an
exact translation ; and the example in question does not occur there.

              On the Theory of Differentvd Resolvents.
                By the Rev, Robert Haklet, F.It.S.

In the earlier development of the theory of differential resolvents attention was

confined almost exclusively to certain trinomial forms of algebraic equations, and
Athe resolvents were calculated for these forms.
                                                  connexion not before noticed

was found to exist between algebraic and differential equations ; and results re-

markahle for their simplicity and elegance were obtained. Some of these results

have been laid before the Section at former Meetings (see Reports of the Asso-

ciation, ' Transactions of Sections,' 1862, pp. 4, 5 ; 1865, p. 6 ; 1866, pp. 2, 3).

   Every differential resolvent may he regarded under two distinct aspects: it

may he considered either (first) as giving in its complete integration the solution

of the algebraic equation from which it has been derived, or (.secondly) as itself

solvable by means of that equation. The two equations, the algebraic and the

differential, are in fact coresolvents. The subject was first considered in the former

aspect by Sir .lames Cockle, the originator of the theory, and bv Mr. Harley : and
their researches will be found emhodied in various papers published in the ' Phi-

1873.                                                   2

losophical Magazine,' the 'Quarterly Journal of Mathematics,' the _' Manchester
Memoirs,' and the ' Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society.' It has
been shown that every dilierential resolvent is satisfied, not only by each of the
roots, but also by each of the constituents of the roots of the algebraic equation to
which it belongs, and that these constituents are in fact the particular integrals of
the resolvent equation. In the latter aspect every differential resolvent of the form

in which is a variable parameter, and u considered as a function of 6 is a root
+ Uof a certain algebraic equation of the (« l)th degree, gives, when
                                                                                                   is of an

--order higher than the second, a new primary form that is to say, a form not re-

cognized as primary in the late Professor IBoole's theory. And in certain cases in

which the dexter of the defiuina: equation does not vanish, a comparatively easy

transformation  will  rid  the equation  of  the  dexter  term                           and  the  resulting  dif-
                                                                                      ;

ferential equation will be of a new primary form. The same transformation which

deprives the algebraic equation of its second term will deprive the dift'erential

equation of its dexter term.

   Boole, in his last paper before the Roj'al Society, entitled " On the Differential

--Equations which determine the form of the Roots of Algebraic Equations,'' re-

marks : " While the subject seems to be more important vnih relation to differ-
ential than with reference to algebraic equations, the connexion into.which the

two subjects are brought must itself be considered as a very interesting fact.
As respects the former of these subjects, it may be observed that it is a matter
of quite fundamental importance to ascertain for what forms of the function

^(D), equations of the type

Weadmit of finite solution.  possess theorems which enable us to deduce from

each known integrable form an infinite number of others. Yet there is every

reason to think that the number of really primary forms (of forms the knowledge

of which, in combination with such known theorems, would enable us to solve all

equations of the above type that are finitely solvable) is extremely small. It will
indeed be a most remarkable conclusion, should it ultimately prove that the forms
in question stand in absolute and exclusive connexion with the class of algebraic
equations here considered." (Phil. Trans, for 1864, p. 733 ct seq.)

    In his later researches the author of this paper has sought to determine the
form of the differential resolvents of algebraic equations whose terms are complete,

and whose coefficients are unmodified. Mr. Spottiswoode has also considered the
question in this its most general aspect; and in a short paper on "Differential
Resolvents," printed in the second volume of the third series of the ' Manchester
Memoirs,' pp. 227-232, he has exemplified a method of finding the resolvents in
the cases of quadratics and cubics, which is directly applicable to all degrees.
This method, considered as a working process, possesses some advantages over that

employed by Sir James Cockle and Mr. Harley in dealing with trinomial forms.
Its chief peculiarity consists in effecting all necessary eliminations by means of

determinants.

Beginning with the quadratic

which gives                          (fl, b, c) {X, iy-=o,

where differentiation with respect to the parameter is indicated by accents, Mr.
Spottiswoode forms a system of equations from which by the elimination of all
powers of .v higher than the first, he deduces

of the identical equation  +b{cd) c(db)+d{bc)=0,

we find that

only in it d' takes the place of (bd), and c' of (be). Finally, if we also make c'=0,
we have

Remarks on Professor Evans's Method of solving Cubic and other Trinomial

            Sur TIrrationalite de la Base des Logarithmes Hyperholiques.
                                           Par Ch. Hekmite.

   On reconnaitra volontiers que dans le domaine math^matique, la possession

d'une verite importante ne devient complete et detinitive qu'autant qu'ou a rcSussi

a I'etablir par plus d'uue methode. A cet egard, la tbeorie des fonctions eUiptiques

oft're un example ceiebre, present a tons les esprits, mais qui est loin d'etre unique

dans I'analjse. Je citerai encore le tbeoreme de Sturm, reste comme envelopp^
d'une sorte de mj'stere jusqu'a la memorable decouverte de M. Sylvester, qui a

ouvert pour penetrer au coeiu- de la question, une voie plus facile et plus feconde
que celle du premier inventeur. Telles sont encore dans I'aritbmetique superieure,

les lois de reciprocitiS eutre deux nombres premiers auxquelles est attache le nom a
jamais ilhistre d'Eisenstein. Mais dans cette meme science et pour des questions

du plus haut iuteret, conime la determination du uombre des cla.^ses de formes

quadratiques de meme invariant, on a ete moius beureux, et jusqu'ici le merite de

la premiere decouverte est rest^ sans partage a Diricblet. Lntin et pour en venir

a I'objet de cette note, je citerai encore dans le champ de I'aritbmetique, la pro-
position de Lambert sur I'irrationalite du rapport de la circonfereuce au diametre,
et des puissances de la base des logarithmes hyperboliques. Ayant ete recemment
conduit a m'occuper de ce dernier nombre, j'ai Thonneur de soumetire a la reunion
de I'Association Eritannique une demonstration nouvelle du tbeoreme de Lambert,
oil n'intervient plus le calcul integral, et qui, je I'espere, paraitra entierement 6l&

mentaire. Je pars simplement de la serie :

                                                                                                               ,, i»

il suffira comme on va voir, de prendre les derivees d'ordre n des deux membres de

cette relation. Effectivement, on obtient d'abord :

On the Calculation of Logarithms. By tlie Rev. Henry "VVacb, M.A.,

                 Brasenose College, Oxford, Chaplain of LincoWs Inn.

   Fertile purpose of any further extension of oui- power of logarithmic computation,
the author thinks attention should be recalled to the principle of the method pro-

posed in 1845 by Mr. Weddle. An account of this method and of its history may

be found in Mr. Peter Gray's preface to his ' Tables for the formation of Logarithms
and Antilogarithms to twelve places,' published in 18G5. It combines with great
directness and simplicity the advantage of increasing in facility of application as

the number of places is increased to which the computation is carried. It may be

briefly described as a means for expressing all numbers, of whatever magnitude, in
terms of certain factors to any required degree of accuracy. These factors are of the

+form l 'l^.w, where wj is any integer and n any simple integer. When tabulated

they present the following series :

                                         09,-999 9099 99999

                      1-9 1-09' 1^009l 1^0009

For convenience the author proposes to call these the Constituent Factors, and

the former the negative, the latter the positive factors; and the tables of their

logarithms may be called positive and negative Constituent Tables. To find the

logarithms of numbers we use the negative table ; to find antilogarithms, the pos-
Aitive table.
                   single example will show how numbers may be expressed in terms

of the negative factors and of the integers up to 11.

  A number on which Borda and Delambre have operated, viz. 543839, working to

twelve places of decimals, may be taken as an example. DiA'ide by 10^ and 5, and

the number becomes

                      1-087678.

Om- next object is to desti'oy the significant figure 8 in the second place of decimals.

--For this purpose multiply the number by 1 ^08 or ·92. This is the same thing as

to subtract from the number eight times itself advanced two places ; and the work
--is as follows :
                   .

The next factor required would be 1 - -0000003 ; but it is evident that multiplica-
tion by this factor would not aftect the twelfth place of decimals, and consequently
the last six significant figures tlius obtained represent, without any further work,

the remaining factors required.

   It is thus shown that

or that, to the requisite degree of accuracy, 543839 can he expressed as a fraction,
the numerator of -which is

   The method of applying the positive table to find antilogarithms is better known,

and need not here be explained.

   It is further evident that we may by similar means express in terms of the neo-a-
tive factors the concluding figm-es of any number, or any decimal addition made to
a given number. Thus, suppose we know the logarithms of 543 to 12 places, and
wish to know that of 543-839, we operate on the latter number as follows :

   After working to half the number of figures, we proceed by simple division ; and

the multipliers corresponding to the successive quotients are

                  ·999,999,7, -999,999,999, &c.

This process may be regarded as a method of intei-polation, and it appears to the

author simpler and more direct than that of diflerences. It enables us, in short, by a

direct operation to express differences in terms of a limited number of known factors.

The logarithms of these factors are determined with great facility from the fun-

damental series,

                  log (l±!/) = ±y-iy'±-y'-i'/±S^c;

miory being of the form ·!'", this series converges with great rapidity as increases,

so much so that for the latter half of tlie number of columns required in a consti-

tuent table only the first term of the series is required. Suppose, for instance, we
are working to twenty places, then the hyperbolic logarithm of 1 -- -1" x 7 or of

                  ·99999,99999,3= --00000,00000,7.

The determination of h'N'perbolic logarithms by this method is therefore peculiarly
easy, the logarithms of the last half of the factors being written down for inspection

without reference to the tables.

  A fuller development of this method, embodying perhaps some improvement in

its working, will be found in a paper contributed by the author to the ' Cambridge
Messenger of Mathematics,' which will appear in the September and October
Numbers of this year. The author has there furnished constituent tables for both
hyperbolic and denary logarithms to twenty figures and he has discussed the rela-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

tion of the method to some modifications of it proposed by Mr. Gray and others. It
would occupy too much space to enter here on these collateral points ; but the author
doss not think any modification of the method hitherto proposed retains its elasticity.
It affords, at all events, a valuable means of calculating and testing isolated logarithms,
and of extending partial tables of logarithms, such as are given in Callet, to a high
number of figures. The principle, moreover, of reducing numbers to the form l-Q
.... or 1 00 ... . might be employed to facilitate the printimj; of tables of ten or
twelve figures. If the logarithms were tabulated of the integers up to 11 and
of the numbers between 1 and I'Ol or I'OOl, a short table of auxiliai-y constituent
factors would furnish the logarithms of aU other numbers by very simple calculations.
Such a plan would probably be an improvement on that of the partial ten-figure

tables published ten years ago by Pineto.

--AOn a Geometrical Solution of the followiwj problem  quiescent rigid bochj

possessing three degrees of freedom receives an impulse ; determine the in-

stantaneous screw about which the body commences to twist. By IIobekt

Stawell Ball, LL.D., F.B.S.

                                                                                                     I.

   For an explanation of the language used, and for proof of several theorems, re-
ference must be made to " Theory of Screws," Transactions of the Royal Irish
Academy, vol. xxv. p. 157.

   All the screws about which the body can be twisted form a coordinate-system
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

one screw of the coordinate system can be found parallel to any given direction.

   An ellipsoid can be found such that the radius vector, from the centre to the

surface, is proportional to the twist velocity with which the body must twist
about the parallel screw, so that its kinetic energy shall be one unit. This is the
ellipsoid of equal kinetic eneripj.

   Let s be the screw about which an impulsive wrench, F,, constitutes the given
impulse. All the screws belonging to the coordinate-system which are reciprocal

to s lie upon a cylindroid, the principal plane of which is called the reciprocal
jdanc. Then the required instantaneous screw u is detei-mined ; for it is parallel to

that diameter of the ellipsoid of equal kinetic energy which is conjugate to the

reciprocal plane.

  --Ihe demonstration is as follows: Any three conjugate diameters of the ellip-

soid of equal kinetic energy are pai-allel to three screws of the system, which are
conjugate scretcs of kinetic energy. The property possessed by three conjugate

Cscrews of kinetic energy A, B, C, is that if A', B', be three impulsive screws

corresponding respectively to A, B, C as instantaneous screws, then A' is reciprocal

A C ABto and C, B' is reciprocal to and C, is reciprocal to and B.

   If u be one of three conj ugate screws of kinetic energy, the two others must be
parallel to the reciprocal plane, and therefore reciprocal to s. Hence an impulsive
wrench about s must make the body commence to twist about u,

                                                                                          II.

   The same construction may be arrived at in a different manner.

    Let q be the screw of the coordinate-system which is normal to the plane reci-

procal to s.

  M--V--LetF,= ' be the impulsive wrench which acts about s for the infinitel}'

small time t.

   Let £0^ be the twist velocity with which a body must twist uniformly round q

in order to do one unit of work against F in the time t.
   Draw a plane parallel to the reciprocal plane at a distance a>q from the kinematic

centre.

   Draw the cone from the kinematic centre to the intersection of this plane with

the ellipsoid of equal kinetic energy.

   Then all the screws of the coordinate-system which are parallel to the gene-

--rators of this cone possess the following property : That if the body be constrained

to twist about any one of these screws it will, in consequence of the impulsive

wrench F^, move oft' from rest with the unit of kinetic energy.

   The screw s being given, F^ will vary inversely as a> ; consequently when the
plane touches the ellipsoid, and when the cone has shrunk to one right line, a

smaller impulse about s will give the body the unit of kinetic energy about the
screw of the system parallel to that line, than if the body had been constrained
about any other screw of the system.

   Applying Euler's theorem, that a body will always move off" with the maximum

kinetic energy, -we arrive at the construction already given.

                         III.

Converseh', given the instantaneous screw u, about which the body will com-

mence to tvsdst, selected from the general coordinate-system with three degi-ees of

freedom, determine the corresponding impulsive screw s.

This problem is  really  indeterminate                                                                    the  conditions  to  be fulfilled  by s  are
                                                                                                       ;

thus proved. Draw the plane in the ellipsoid of equal kinetic energy, conjugate

to the direction of «<. Construct the cylindroid of screws belonging to the system

which are parallel to this plane, then s may be any screw reciprocal to this cylin-

droid. For example, through any point a cone of screws can be drawn, any one

of which, as an impulsive screw, corresponds to u as an instantaneous screw.

On the Kinematics of a Rigid Body*. By Professor J. D. Everett, F.R.S.E.

   The object of the paper is the investigation of the instantaneous movement of a
rigid body (having no point fixed). Such investigation has usually been confined
to properties depending on the consideration of two consecutive positions ; and the
investigation is here extended to properties depending on three, and in the case of
motion in one plane to four and five consecutive positions.

   The most general motion of a rigid body may, as is well known, be represented
by a succession of small screwings about successive lines called central axes ; and

--these successive central axes generate two ruled surfaces one in the body, and the

--other in space these two surfaces being perfectly determinate in the case of any

given motion.

   Two cones of determinate shape can be constructed by drawing through an arbi-

trary point of the body lines parallel to the successive central axes in the body,
and by drawing through an arbitrary point of space lines parallel to the successive
central axes in space. It is shown in this paper that the most general motion of a
rigid body can be represented by giving to the cone in space a motion of pure
translation, and causing the cone in the body to roll upon the cone thus translated.

    Expressions are obtained for the curvatures of the two cones coiTesponding to a
given instantaneous motion, the data being derived from the consideration of four
consecutive positions of the body. ^Yhen only three consecutive positions are
given, the curvatures of the two cones are indeterminate, being merely connected
by one equation of condition. Hence, so far as regards properties depending on
three consecutive positions, the instantaneous motion of a rigid body can always
be represented by the rolling of a right circidar cone in the body upon a plane
which has a movement of translation in space. In this representation the curva-

ture of the circular cone is determinate, but its vertex is an arbitrary particle ot
the bod}'.

    The locus of those particles which at the instant considered have straight
motion, is investigated, and is found to be in general a cubic curve.

    The cuiwatures of the two ruled surfaces at points on their respective lines of
striction are investigated ; and it is shown that the tangent plane to either of the

 ruled surfaces at a point on the line of striction is perpendicular to the correspond-

ing tangent plane of the cone. The forms of the two ruled surfaces, at points very

distant from the lines of striction, are investigated and shown to be ultimately

identical with the forms of the two cones.

   The condition of intersection of successive central axes is investigated and ex-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

pressions are obtained for the curvatures of the two cuspidal edges which are then

generated, one in the body and the other in space.

Througliout this investigation the motion is supposed to be specified with refer-

ence to rectangular axes tixed in space--the specifying elements being the three

component velocities of translation, the three component velocities of rotation, and

the differential coefficients of these six velocities with respect to time.

The latter portion of tlie paper deals with motion in two dimensions. It is

shown that, in the most general motion of a plane rigid figure in its own plane,

the locus of points which at a given instant have straight motion is a circle

traversing the instantaneous centre ; but one singular point on this circle is to be

excepted from the locus, namely the instantaneous centre itself, which, instead of

being (like other points on the circle) at a point of inflection of its path, is at a

cusp, and is moving with infinite curvature, v^'hereas all other points on the circle

are moving with zero curvature. This startling result is confirmed by a com-

parison of the cycloid witli the trochoid. Wlien a circle rolls along a straiglit

line, a point just within the circumference describes a trochoid having two points

of inflection very near together, and the short connecting arc has a total curvature

of nearl}'  180^                         whereas in the case of a point on  tlie circumference, these features
                                      ;

are replaced by a cusp.

The instantaneous curvatures of the patlis traced b}' the particles, of a moving

figure depend on three consecutive positions only. Four consecutive positions of

the figure are sufficient to determine two consecutive "circles of straight motion."

Those two particles of the body which are situated at the intersections of these

two circles might at first sight be deemed to be points of double straight motion

that is, to have straight motion for two consecutive instants ; but on examination

it turns out that one of tliese two points is not a point of straight motion at all,

being, in fact, the singular point above mentioned. There is therefore in general

only one point of double straight motion. The position of this point is investi-

gated in the general case of one circle rolling on another, and its connexion with

the subject of " apparently neutral " equilibrium of a heavy body is pointed out.

On the Final State of a System of Molecules in Motion subject to Forces of any
                             lind. By J. Clerk Maxwell.

   Since reading Principal Guthrie's first letter on this subject ('Nature,' May 22,

1873), I have thought of several ways of investigating the equilibrium of temperature
in a gas acted on fjy gravity. One of these is to investigate the condition of the
column as to density when the temperature is constant, and to show that when this
is fulfilled the column also fulfils the condition that there shall be no upward or
downward transmission of energy, or, in fact, of any other function of the masses
and velocities of the molecules. But a far more direct and general method was

suggested to me by the investigation of Dr. Ludwig Boltzmann * on the final dis-

tribution of energy in a finite system of elastic bodies ; and the following is a
sketch of tliis method as applied to the simpler case of a number of molecules so

great that it may be treated as infinite.

   Principal Guthrie's second letter is especially valuable as stating his case in the
form of distinct propositions, every one of which, except the fifth, is incontrover-

tible. He has himself pointed out that it is here that we ditter, and that this
difference may ultimately be traced to a difference in our doctrines as to the distri-

bution of velocity .amon^ the molecules of any given portion of the gas. He

assumes, as Olausius (at least in his earlier investig-ations) did, that the velocities

of all the molecules are equal, vrhereas I hold, as I tirst stated in the Philosophical
Magazine for .January 1860, that they are distributed according to the same law as

errors of observation are distributed according to the received theory of such en-ors.

It is easy to show that if the velocities are all equal at any instant they will
become unequal as socn as encounters of any kind, whether collisions or " perihelion
passages," take place. The demonstration of the actual law of distribution was

given by me in an improved form in my paper on the " Dynamical Theory of Gases,"

Phil. Trans. 18(36, and Phil. Mag. 18iJ7 ; and the far more elaborate investigation

of Boltzmann has led him to the same result. I am greatly indebted to Boltzmann

for the method used in the latter part of the following sketch of the general

investigation.

   Let perfectly elastic molecules of different kinds be in motion within a vessel
with perfectly elastic sides, and let each kind of molecules be acted on by forces

which have a potential the form of which may be different for different kinds of

molecules.

   Let X, y, s, be the coordinates of a molecule, M, and ^, rj, ( the components of
its velocity, and let it be required to determine the luuuber of molecules of a given
kind which, on an average, have their coordinates between .r and x-\-dx, y and
y-^dy, z and s+ffc, and also their component velocities between ^ and |+(/^, v and
r}+drj, and f and C+d(. This number must depend on the coordinates and the
components of velocities and on the differences of the limits of these quantities.

We may therefore write it

           <?N=/(jr, y, s, ^, v, f) dx dy dz d$ dr, d(.                      (1)

  We _shall begin by investigating the manner in which this quantity depends

on the components of velocity, before we proceed to determine in what way it

depends on tlie coordinates.

   If we distinguish by suffixes the quantities corresponding to different kinds of
molecules, the whole number of molecules of the first and second kind within a
given space, which have velocities within given limits, may be written

           fi{ki,nuQdix,(kx,<Ki=ni,                                          (2)

   The effect of the force whose potential is \f/i is therefore to cause the molecules
of the first kind to accumulate in gi-eater numbers in those parts of the vessel
towards which the force acts ; and the distribution of each different kind of
molecules in the vessel is determined by the forces which act on them in the

same way as if no other molecules were present. This agrees with Dalton's
doctrine of the distribution of mixed gases.

    On Ethereal Friction. By Professor Baifour Stewart, LL.D., F.R.S.

   Prof. J. G. ^laxwell has made a series of experiments on the friction of gases.
In these experiments a horizontal disk was made to oscillate in an imperfect va-
cuum near a similar disk at rest, and it was found tliat the motion of the oscilla-
tino- disk Wiis carried away by the residual gas of the vacuum at a rate depending
on the chemical character of "the gas, and depending also upon its temperature, but

nevertheless independent of its density.

   While the temperature of the arrangement remained constant, it was found by
Prof. Maxwell that this flLud friction was rather greater for atmospheric air than
for carbonic acid, while for hydrogen it was about half a-s great as for air.
                                          TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                     33

On the other hand, when the temperatiu'es were made to vary, the result was

found to be proportional to the absolute temperature.

These experiments do not show that there is no such thing as fethereal friction

that is to say, friction from somethinjj which fills all space and is independent of

air; but we may argue from them that such an jethereal friction must either have

been nearly insensible in these experiments, or it must, as weU as the friction from

the gas, have -\-aried with the absolute temperatures, in which case the two frictions
would not be separable from one another by the method of the experiment.

   Prof. Tait and myself have made some experiments upon the heating of a disk
by rapid rotation in vacuo. In these experiments we found a mere surface-heating

due to air, which vaiied not only with the quality but also with the quantity of the

residual   gas                   and  we  also  found  a  surface-etiect  (more  deeply  seated,  however,  than
                              ;

the former) which appeared to be a residual effect, and which it is possible may be
Wedue to sethereal fi-iction.
                                                made no experiments at varying temperatures ; but

we made use of various residual gases, and found that' the heating-effect for

carbonic acid was perhaps a tride less than for air, while that for hydrogen ap-

peared to be about four times less than that for air. Now, comparing Prof. Max-
well's experiments with ours, we ha^·e in the former a stoppage of motion, which is

rather less for carbonic acid than for air, and about half as large for hvdrogen as

for air. In the latter, again, we have a heating-effect rather less for carbonic acid
than for air, and only about one fourth as large for hydrogen as for air. Thus it

appears that the stopping effect of hydrogen in Prof. Maxwell's experiments is re-

latively greater in comparison with a'ir than is its heating-effect in our experiments

when compared with that of air. The effects of these various gases would bear to

one another more nearly the same proportion in both experiments if we might

suppose that in Prof. Maxwell's experiments there was mixed up with gaseous

friction a very sensible ajthereal friction; but in that case it would be necessary to

suppose that the nethereal friction was proportional to the absolute temperature.

  MDuring the eeting of the British Association at Edinburgh, I brought before the

Association reasons for imagining that if we have a body in visible motion in an

enclosure of constant temperature the visible motion of the body will gradually be
changed into heat. The nature of the argument was such as to render it probable

(although not absolutely certain) that in such a case the rapidity of conversion will
be greater the higher the temperature of the enclosure.

   1 will now refer to some experiments of Prof. Tait, which formed the subject of
the last Rede Lecture. These experiments were suggested to Prof Tait by an

h_^T3othesis derived from the theory of the dissipation of energy, which led him to

think that the resistance of a substance to the conduction of electricity, and also of
heat, would be found proportional to the absolute temperature. Matthiessen and

Von Bose in the case of electricity, and Principal Forbes in the case of heat, had

already proved that, as a matter of fact, the law was not very different from that
imagined by Prof. Tait. The result of these experiments has"^ been to confirm the

truth of this law.

   The following considerations, also connected with the dissipation of euergv, point
to the same conclusion.^ Perhaps we may regard the nsthereal medium as "that
medium whose office it is to degrade all directed motion and ultimately convert it

into univei-sally difliised heat, and in virtue of which all the visible ditierential

motion of the universe will ultimately be destroyed by some process analogous to

friction.

Now in order to imagine the way in which aether may possibly act in bringing

about this result, let us imagine some familiar instance of directed motion, as, for

instance, a railway-train in motion. The train, let us suppose, and the air in it,

Noware both in rapid motion, while the air outside is at rest.                           as the train pro-

ceeds, suppose that a series of cannons loaded with blank cartridges are fired
Atowards the train.
                                          series of violent sounds will go in at the one window and

out at the other of each carriage. Each sound will push some air from the stratum

of air at rest into the carriage on the one side, and it will push some air from the

Nowcarriage into the stratum at rest on the other side.                          in this operation it would

seem that part of the visible motion of the train must be taken from it. To make

a comparison, it is as if a series of individuals were jumping into the train at the

l'^73.                                                                                            3
34 REPORT-- 1873.

one side and out of it at the otlier, the result being that each carries away so much

of the motion of the train, and therefore renders it difficult for the engine to drive
the train. Each individual comes to the ground with an immense forward impetus

and rubs along the ground till this is lost, in fact he carries with him so much

motion of the train and converts it into heat by friction against the ground.

  Now something similar to this must happen to a substance in visible motion in

an enclosure of constant temperature. The rays of light and heat will play very
much the same part as the waves of sound, or as the crowd of people in the above
illustration, at least if we except those which fall perpendicularly upon the surface
of the moving body. The moving body is like the train, and the rays of light and
heat are similar to individuals entering the train from a stratum of aether at rest,
and leaving the train into a stratum of sether at rest again, each probably transmu-
ting into heat a certain small portion of the visible motion of the train as it were
by a species of friction. Of course the intensity of such an influence would depend

upon the intensity of the rays of light and heat. Now it matters not what the

particular kind of motion be which constitutes this train, and we may assert that

all directed motion will suffer from such a cause, and possibly according to the
same laws. Visible motion, such as that of a rotating disk or of a meteor is of

course one form of such motion but a current of electricity or of heat may equally
                                                                                                                                                                             ;

represent some form of directed motion. In fine we may perhaps suppose that all
forms of directed motion are resisted by this peculiar influence, which evidently
depends upon what we may term the temperatm-e of the ajther, or at least upon the

intensity of those vibrations which the aether transmits.

                   By William Htiggins, D.C.L., LL.D., F.B.S.

   There are three kinds of motion which we may expect to exist in a nebula, which,

if sufficiently rapid, might be detected by the spectroscope :

  A1. motion of rotation in the case of the planetary nebulaB, which might be dis-

covered by placing the slit of the spectroscope on opposite limbs of the nebula.

  A2. motion of translation in the visual direction of some portions of the nebu-

lous matter within the nebula. Such motion might possibly oe detected by com-

                 a spectroscope of sufficient dispersive power, the spectra of different parts
of a large nebula such as that in Orion.

   Aq motion of translation in space of the nebula in the line of sight.

   The observations to be described were undertaken with the view of searching for
this last kind of motion, namely that of the whole nebula in the line of sight. For
this purpose it is necessary to compare the lines of the nebula with those of a ter-

restrial substance which has been found to be in the nebula. Now the coincidence

of the third and fourth line of the nebular spectrum with lines of hydrogen was
available in the case of a few only of the brightest nebulfe.

    I had found that the apparent coincidence of the brightest line of the nebulae with

the brightest line in the spectrum of nitrogen was not maintained when a more
powerful spectroscope was used. The nebular line was then seen to be thin and

 defined, while the line of nitrogen appeared double and each of its components
 nebulous at the edges. The thin line of the nebula coincides very nearly with the
 less refrangible of the two lines forming the double line of nitrogen.

    Fortunately I fovmd a line which appears under some conditions of the spark in
 the spectrum of lead, which is single, defined, and occurs exactly at that part of
 the spectrum. This line is represented in Thalen's map by a short line, to indicate
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                               35

that under ordinary conditions of the spark, when the characteristic lines of lead
are strong, this line is seen only in the part of the metal vapour which is close to

the electrode. I found, however, that under other conditions of the electric dis-
charge this line extends across the spectrum, and becomes bright, at the same time
that the principal lines of the lead-spectrum are very faint.

  A simultaneous comparison of this line with the brightest of the lines of the

nebulffi showed that, if not truly coincident, it was sufficiently so, under the powers
of dispersion which can be applied to the nebulas, to serve as a fiducial line of com-
parison in the observations which I had in view.

   I need not say that the coincidence of the lines does not indicate the presence

of lead in the nebula.

   I found that in the spectrum of the great nebula in Orion, at the same time that
the third line was seen to be coincident with H;8, the first line appeared to coincide
with the line in the spectrum of lead. There was a very slight apparent excess of
breadth in the nebular line, due possibly to its being in a small degree the brighter
of the two, which appeared to extend towards the red, so that the more refrangible
sides of the lines were in a right line.

   The lead line could now be used as a fiducial line for the examination of the

motion of the nebulae which are too faint to permit of direct comparison with hy-

drogen.

   By this method the following nebulae have been carefully examined. In all

these nebulae the relative position of the first nebular line with the lead line was
found to be exactly the same in a spectroscope containing two compound prisms
which together give a dispersion about equal to that of four single prisms of dense

flint of 60°.

   The results, though negative, are, however, not without interest, as they show
that these nebulae were not moving toward or from the earth with a velocity so

great as thirty miles per second.

  A point of lig'tt, viewed at a distance throiio;]! plates of glass ·with ooncentric

circles ruled tliereou, is seen to be suiTounded b}' rings of brilliant colours. The
author tried the experiment of introducing the ruled glass into a beam of sunlight
^ an inch in diameter, and viewing the rings on a screen placed 10 feet from the

ruled plate, with the following results :

   With 2500 lines to the inch there appear two rings of colour, the diameters of

the red rings (which are always outwardj being 1 foot 5 inches and 2 feet 10 inches,
the width of the rings from the outside of the red to the inside of the violet in each
case being respectivelv 31 inches and 6} inches.

   With 3500, 1 foot 8 inches and 3 feet 3 inches, width 4^" and 8".
   With 5000, only one ring 3 feet in diameter, width 8".
   With 10,000, one ring 5 feet in diameter, width 11".

    There are other rings visible, but they are faint and indefinite.
    The coloured rings are also seen by reflection from the outer glass, with the same

On some Abnormal Effects of Binocular Vision. Bij W. S. Davis.

While using a Herapath blowpipe a short time since, and having my eyes fixed

intently on a bead held in the flame, I was suddenly startled by seeing the papered

wall, which was about three feet in front of me, make its appearance close up to

the point of the flame, the patterns of the paper being at the same time much
diminished in size. Casting my eyes from side to side, and upwards and down-

wards, the appearance still remained as distinct as in ordinary sight ; on moving

my eyes beyond the boundary of the wall the appearance immediately vanished.

I afterwards succeeded in reproducing the appearance by simply looking at the wall

and converging the optic axes of my eyes.

  It occurred to me that the phenomenon I had seen was due to the crossing of the
optic axes of my eyes, the angle being such that each eye received the impression

of a precisely similar figure. Under these circumstances a single figure would be

seen, as when a single flat object is viewed with both eyes in ordinary sight. In

order to satisfy myself that this was the correct explanation I made a geometrical

construction, traced the relations which should hold, and verified them by actual

measurements.

Continuing my experiments, I succeeded by a further convergence of the optic

axes to combine alternate patterns, and pairs stiU more widely separated, up to

twelve or more. It is a very interesting experiment to combine a given pattern

with, say, the fifth or sixth from it, and then by a peculiar effort, more easily made

than described, to let one pattern slip at a time, the waD retreating by steps as each

pattern is slipped.

   On one occasion, when I had combined two patterns at some distance apai-t, 1
happened to shut one eye, when, to my surprise, the combinational figure remained

as distinct and at the same distance as before. I can only account for this by sup-

posing that the muscles of the eye which was closed were still acting in sympathy

with those of the open eye                                                                                                                            and subsequent experiments favoured this view.
                                                                                                                                                   ;

The results of the foregoing experiments led me to think that it would be possible

to optically combine two patterns without crossing the optic axes, provided the

distance between the centres of the patterns was not greater than that between the

centres of the eyes. This I succeeded in doing, and the result was very remarkable :

the wall appeared to retreat and take up a fixed position at some distance beyond its

actual position; on looking slowly upwards and sideways along the wall" the di-

mensions of the room ajjpeared to be enormously increased, while on looking down-

wards I appeared to be perched on a sort of gallery, the wall appearing to be several

yards from me, and descending many yards below tlie floor on which I was standing.

This appearance was as \ivid and distinct as in the case of ordinarv vision.

   Witli patterns on a liorizontal surface, such as a carpet, the results were verj' cmioua.

On comtDiniug; pairs of patterns with the optic axes crossed, I appeared to be stand-
ing in a hole with the level of the floor up to my waist, while on combining pairs

of patterns with the optic axes uncrossed, I was apparently standing on a pedestal

with the widely expanded floor far below me ; and so strong was the delusion, that
I could scarcely venture to move for fear of falling over.

   Colours I found could be fairly well combined by painting two patterns diflereut
colours and then causing the two to coalesce, with or without crossing the optic

axes.

   I have also succeeded in combining two solid bodies of the same size and shape,
but of different colour, both with the optic axes crossed and with them uncrossed.
Perhaps one of the most curious experiments I have made of this kind is to opti-
cally combine the heads of two persons, thereby producing' a combinational figure

of the two.

                     On a Refraction-Spectrum without a Prism.

                        By Professor J. D. Everett, F.R.S.E.

It was pointed out by WoUaston in the Philosophical Transactions for 1800, that

triple images can be obtained by looking at real objects through the stratum of

intermixture of two liquids of different refractive powers, one of which has been

gently poured on the top of the other.

Having set up an arrangement of this kind last spring, in a cubical vessel (raea-

siu-ing 6 inches each way) with plate-glass sides, a strong solution of common salt

beiug the lower liquid and pure water the upper, I observed such decided colour-

effects, that the idea occurred to me of trying whether a spectrum could be obtained.

I accordingly placed the vessel of liquid on a high stool in the centre of a dark room,

and looked through the stratum of intermixture at a horizontal slit in the window-

shutter, which was about 10 feet distant, and was below the level of the said stra-

tum. The following were some of the phenomena observed, about a week having

elapsed since the liquids were placed in the vessel. When the eye was at any dis-

tance less tlian about 3 feet from the vessel, one image of the slit was seen. It was

highly coloured, forming a very impure spectrum, with blue above and red below.

Its apparent position was above the real slit, and at about the same distance from

the observer.

  When the eye was at a distance of 3^ feet or upwards from the vessel, three

images of the slit were visible. At some distances they could all be seen at once.
At other distances two could be seen at once, and the third came into A'iew on rais-

ing or lowering the eye. AU three of them were above the true direction of the

slit, and all were highly coloured. The highest and the lowest were virtual images,

and were almost precisely alike and similar to the single image above described.

They were erect images, and had accordingly blue above and red below. Between

them, when the eye was at a proper height, was seen another image with more

colour than either, and with the colours in inverted order, that is to say, with

red above and blue below. It was in fact a real and inverted image, formed at

the distance of about 3 feet from the vessel ; and a screen held,there received the

image in the form of a horizontal line of light with coloured edges, the action of

the liquid being somewhat similar to that of a cylindrical lens. All the images

were very impure in colour, being nearly white in their central portions.

The colours were improved by lowering the eye so as to make the middle image

move up to the highest. Red was the first colour that appeared at the junction
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and it showed extremely well. Violet (or when the light was feeble, blue) was

the last colour tliat was seen before both images became extinct by the descent of

the observer's eye.

The largest sheets of colour were seen when the eye was exactly at the place

where the real image was formed. It was easy to obtain a long vertical strip of

blue by holding the eye at the distance of about 3 feet, and a long vertical strip of

Ared by holding the ej'e at the distance of about 4 feet.  long vertical strip of rich

yellow could be obtained at an intermediate distance.

The experiment was varied by holding close in front of the eye a card with a
38 REPOKT-- 1873.

fine horizontal slit, the observer of course looking tlirough the slit ; and in some
of the observations this card was fixed in an adjustable stand, and the slit brought

into coincidence with the real image before looking through. The red and blue

were not much altered by the introduction of the card                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              but yellow could with diffi-

culty be obtained, the yellow previously obtained having in fact been a highly com-

posite colour.

The apparatus was left to itself for several days ; and its focal length was found

to be continually increasing ; that is to say, the real image receded further and

further from the vessel, the average recess (estimated very roughly) being about a

foot per day, till it reached the wall, which was 10 feet distant.
   The experiment was repeated, first with solution of sugar of lead, and secondly

with solution of alum, in place of solution of salt ; but the original experiment gave
the finest displays of colour.

   There is no difficulty in explaining the phenomena above described. They are
mainly due to the bending of rays towards that side on which the index of refrac-

tion is greatest (which in the above instances is the lower side), and to the fact

that this bending is greatest for the rays of shortest wave-length. The magnitude,

however, of the chromatic effiBct is very startling ; and I am not aware that any

such residts have been previously recorded.

   Possibly the increase of focal length in such an arrangement as is above described

may be found to furnish a convenient test of the rapidity of liquid diflusion.

Photographs of Fluorescent Substances. Exhibited by Dr. Gladstone, F.R.S.

   These photographs were of the same nature as those exhibited at the Meeting in
1859, to show that the alteration of the refrangibility of the extreme rays of the
spectrum by fluorescent substances reduces their chemical activity. But as it had
been objected that the lessened photograpliic eflect might be due to a change of
surface through wetting the paper and coating it with a salt, a crucial experiment
was made by writing on a piece of white paper with black ink, bisulphate of qui-

nine, bisulphate of potash, common salt, and pure water. When this was photo-

graphed, the writing in water or in the non-fluorescent salts was not perceptible,
but the fluorescent quinine was strongly rendered, though not so strongly as the ink.
In another photograph, however, two glasses filled respectively with ink and with
a very sti-ong but colourless solution of quinine, came out equally almost black.

 On the Relation of Geometrical Optics to other Branches of Mathematics and
                      Physics. By Professor Cleek Maxwell.

   The author said that the elementary part of optics was often set before the student
in a form which was at once repulsive to the mathematician, immeaning to tlie phy-
sical inquirer, and useless to the practical optician. The mathematician looked for
precision, and found approximation ; the physicist expected unity in the science,
and foimd a great gulf between geometrical and physical optics ; and the optician
found that if he had to design a microscope, he was expected to combine the ana-
lytical power of a Gauss with the computative skill of a Glaisher before he could
make head or tail of the formulae. The author maintained that elementary optics
might be made attractive to the mathematician by showing that the correlation
between the object and the image is not only an example, but the fundamental tj'pe
of that principle of duality which was the leading idea of modern geometry. The
object and image were homographic figures, such that every straight line or ray in
t-he one was represented by a straight line or ray in the other. The relations between

pairs of figures of that kind formed an important part of tlie geometry of position,
an excellent treatise on wliich had been brought out by M. Theodor Reye. To the
physicist he would exhibit the unity of the science, by adopting Hamilton's cha-
racteristic function as explained in his papers on systems of rays, and using it in the
most elementary form fi-om the very beginning of the subject, leading at once to the

undiUatory theory of light. At the same time the practical optician would learn what

were the cardinal points of an optical instrument, and would be able to determine
them without taking the instrument to pieces. Helmholtz and Listing had pointed
out the advantages of the method to the oculist ; and Beck had recently placed some
of the elementary points in a clear light. Casorati had also exemplified some of the
advantages of the method of homographic figui-es in elementary optics ; but though
Gauss, the modern founder of that method, and several others, had made honourable
mention of the name of Roger Cotes, and of that theorem with respect to which

Newton said that " if Mr. Cotes had lived we should have known something," no

one seemed to have suspected that it would form the meeting-point of all the three
methods of treating the science of optics.

On a Natural Limit to the Sharpness of the Spectral Lines.

On the Injiaence of Temperature and Pressure on the Widening of the Lines
              in the Spectra of Gases. By Arthur Schtister, Ph.D.

   The question has often been discussed whether it is temperature or pressure which
causes the widening of the lines in the spectrum of hydi'ogen. Some spectroscopists
are of opinion that this widening of the lines is caused by the clashing together of
the gaseous molecules, while others seem to think that the forces which maintain
the molecule in vibration are altered by the temperature, and now allow the mole-

cule to vibrate in different or less-defined periods. It is difficult to decide the

question by experiment. The only means we have to render the gas luminous is to

pass an electric current through it. But we know not in what way this current

influences the velocity of the molecules, and therefore the number and force of the

Weshocks.  cannot alter the temperature of the spark without altering the pressure

within it ; and therefore we cannot decide the question, as has been tried, by merely
changing the mode of discharge. The following considerations seem to me to be

strongly in favour of the ^^ew that each separate molecule would show at all tem-

peratures the narrow lines, but that the shocks of the other molecules cause the

widening. Frankland and Lockyer have found that if we increase the pressure of

hydrogen while an electric current is passing through it, the lines begin to expand,

all the spectrum becomes continuous, and, finally, the resistance becomes so large

that the electric current will not pass at all. On the other hand, Gassiot and Pliicker

have observed that if we diminish the pressure of hydrogen its electric resistance

diminishes, attains a minimum, then increases again ; and if we keep on exhausting

the tube, it becomes so great again that the current cannot pass. Pliicker says that

a tube exhausted to its utmost limits shows the lines of hydrogen and siUca. He

says at one place, "I think that the lines are very fine and distinct." If there

had been any widening, he would have been sure to mention it. Now it is not

too much to assume that the resistance of the gas at the moment when the

discharge just ceases to pass is the same whether the increase of resistance is pro-

duced by too great a pressure or too great an exhaustion. At this moment, there-

fore, the current is the same, and the same energy must be converted into heat by

resistance. But in the case in which the current does not pass on account of the

excessive diminution of pressure, there is only a much smaller quantity of gas to be

heated than in the other case ; it must consequently be heated up to a much higher

temperatm-e ; and yet the spectrum is not continuous ; the lines are not even

Wewidened.  are therefore compelled to accept Frankland and Lockyer's original

conclusion, that pressure, and not heat, is the cause of the widening of the lints.

years ago on the top of Snowdon. He saw his own shadow surrounded by five

concentric coloured bows, which seemed to approach as the fog came nearer, until

Similar phenomena have often been observed ; but so great a number of bows has
never been seen.

  Notes of some Expenments on tlie Thermal Conductivities of certain Hocks.

                      By Prof. A. S. Herschel, B.A.,F.R.A.S.

   The paper read was an abstract of the physical portion of that communicated to
the Geological Section by Professor Herschel and Mr. G. A. Lebour. It was re-
marked that the principal difficulty in determining thermal conductivities from

experiments with thin plates, is to ascertain the real temperatures of their faces
during the transmission of the heat. The measurements of temperature were

made with thermoelectric couples of tbin platinum and iron wires connected with
a Thomson's reflecting galvanometer ; and it was found that although enclosed
between two metallic plates differing as much as 80° or 90° C. from each other
in temperature, the corresponding range of temperature between the two surfaces
of the half-inch rock plates employed in the experiments only amounted at most
to between 3° and o° C, while the amount of heat transmitted with this range
corresponded very nearly to the approximately known thermal conductivities of
the rocks. The thermal resistance between the surfaces of solid conductors and
air or other fluids in which they are immersed having been shown by Peclet to
arise from an adhering film of the badl}' conducting fluid with which they are in
contact, it is proposed in another series of experiments, by varying the thicknesses

of the conducting plates, to ascertain the laws of this resistance, and, if they admit of
a convenient interpretation, to an-ive at some simple means of eliminating the effects
of its influence upon the calculated results of experiments like those to which the

various rock-specimens now examined have hitherto been provisionally submitted,

and to obtain exact determinations of their real powers of conducting heat.

On Symmetric Conductors, ami the construction of Licjhtning -conductors
                           By Prof. Cn. V. Zekger*.

   It is an experiment very well known in physics, to place two insulated metallic

hemispheres in contact with an insulated sphere of brass. If the former he charged
with electricity and removed from the inner brass sphere, no trace of electricity is
found on its surface. The electricity is shown to be accumulated only ou the s"ur-
face of the outer spherical conductor, with equal tension at every point of that

surface.

    The author shows that if the outer hemispheres be replaced by two circular
wires, no action whatever will be found ou the inner conductor. This fact may be
best illustrated by the apparatus shown, which consisted of a very sensitive electro-

scope placed on a brass plate, supported by a well-insidated stand. If a charged

ebonite rod be brought near to the electroscope when protected by two circular
wires placed round it, in such a manner as to be in connexion with its gold leaves,

or even if it is brought into contact with the ball of the electroscope, there is no
action upon the leaves; and if the electrified rod be brought between the two
wires and the electroscope itself, only a small action is observed. The author has

tried this experiment with a powerful electric machine (a Holtz machine), and
finally with a large induction-coil of Kuhmkorlf ; and the result was, that sparks
of 35 centims. length produced no effect ou the electroscope.

   At the request of M. Faye, Ruhmkorff made similar experiments with his largest

electric machines, putting a workman in the space between the protecting wfres.
There was no sensation of electric shocks on using the most powerful electric
machine, though a shock was felt on the head of a workmnn when a large induc-
tion-coil was used. The author showed that the effect produced by the action of
the pointed needle,^ though greatly diminished by the wires, is yet sensible, and
that in Ruhmkorfi's experiment a discharge produced by the interference of a
pointed body may account for the diflerence observed by him.

It is easy to see that this experiment may prove useful in regard to the construc-

tion of electric apparatus and of lightning-conductors. The author, therefore, has

examined the action of other forms of symmetrically-arranged conductors. In the

first instance he tried parabolic wires, joined in the same manner to the electroscope

to be protected from the action of electricity, with the same effect; next rect-

angular wires. If the electroscope is placed exactly in the middle of the rectangular

wire, no action is observed; placing it excentrically, there is small but increasing

action, at least if electric sparks of great intensity are striking the ball of the elec-

troscope.                                            If a  needle or any  other sharp -pointed body is placed between the pro-

                                                  _

tecting wire and the electroscope, it is easy to observe the different actions produced

by placing the electroscope in an excentrical position.

Symmetrical wires placed on buildings or over entire cities in this way, would

probably give complete protection from                                    atmospheric electricity                                                                                                          for if the  electric

clouds were even to enter between the objects protected and the protecting vrires,

their activity would be gi-eatly diminished, as shown by the experiments described;

for the wires would become immediately charged, and nearly all the electricity

would be accumulated on their surface, without any danger to the protected build-

ings of being struck by lightning.

               On the Undercurrents of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles.

                  By William B. Caepenter, MD., LL.D., F.R.S.

   In continuation of his communication last year on the Gibraltar Undercurrent
and General Oceanic Circulation, Dr. Carpenter gave the following summary of the
results of the experiments recently made, under direction from the Admiralty by
Capt. Wharton of H.M.S. ' Shearwater,' to put to the test the correctness of I)r.
* Vide Comptes Eendus de I'Academie des Sciences ,Sept. 8, 1872; Le Monde, Sept. 1872.
42 REPORT--1873.

Carpenter's theoretical conclusion that a strong undercurrent must exist between

the ^gean and the Black Sea.

   Although it is commonly supposed that the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus

s««r/rtce-currents are overjlow-cuxienta, carrying ofl' the excess of fresh water dis-

charged by rivers into the Black Sea, yet it is now clear that they are in great
measiu'e tcind-cuxients. During about three quarters of the year the wind blows
pretty steadily fi'om the N.E. (that is, down the Straits) ; and, as a rule, the stronger
and more continuous the wind, the stronger is the surface out-current. On calm

days, the out-cm'rent of the Dardanelles is usually slack ; and if, as sometimes

happens, a strong wind blows from the S.W., its ilow may be entirely checked.

It requires a continuance of strong S.W. wind, however, to reverse its direction;
and its rate, when reversed, is never equal to that of tlie out-current. The speed

--of the Dardanelles cun-ent varies at different parts of the Strait, according to its

breadth being usually about one knot per hour at Gallipoli, and three knots in the
" Narrows '' at Chanak Kaleksi, where, with a strong N.E. wind, it is sometimes as

--much as four and a half knots, the average of the whole being estimated by Oapt.

Wharton at one and a half knots. The Bosphorus current has not been as care-
fully studied as that of the Dardanelles ; but Capt. Wharton states that its rate is
greater, averaging about two and a half knots per houi', apparently in consequence
of the limitation of its channel, which is scarcely wider at any point than is the
Dardanelles at the "Narrows." It continues to run, though at a reduced rate,
when there is no wind ; and it is onlj' in winter^ after a continued S.W. gale of

long duration, that a reversal of the Bosphorus current ever takes place.
   It might have been supposed that, as the greatest depth of these two Straits

does not exceed fifty fathoms, the determination of the question as to the existence
of an undercm-rent would be a comparatively easy matter. But it is rendered
difficidt by the very rapidity of the movement, alike in the upper and the lower

stratum ; and the results of the earlier experiments made by Capt. Wharton, in
which he used the cm-rent-drags that had been found to work satisfactorily in the
Strait of Gibraltar, were not conclusive. But perceiving from the very oblique
direction of the suspending line, that the undercurrent must be acting on the
current-drag at a great disadvantage, Capt. Wharton set himself to devise a drag
which should hang vertically, even when the suspending line was oblique, so as to
expose a large surface to the impact of a current at right angles to it. This worked
satisfactorily, and gave the most conclusive evidence of the existence of a powerful
undercurrent, by dragging the suspending buoy iinvards against the sui-face-cur-
rent ; the force of which, aided by wind, was sufficient on several occasions to

prevent the row-boats from following the buoy, only the steam cutter being able
to keep up with it. The following, which is the most striking of all his results,
was obtained in the Bosphorus on the 21st of last August, with a surface-current
running outwards at the rate of three and a half knots per horn-, and a N.E. wind

of force 4. " When the current-drag was lowered to a depth afterwards assumed

to be twenty fathoms, it at once rushed violently away against the sm-face-stream,
the large buoy and a small one being pulled completely xmder water, the third alone
remaining visible. It was a wonderful sight to see this series of floats tearing
through the water to windward. The steam cutter had to go full speed to keep
pace with it." It is obvious that the real rate of the undercurrent must be very
much greater than that indicated by the actual movement of the float, since the
 current-drag impelled by it had to draw the large suspending buoys and the upper
 part of the line against the powerful surface-current running at three and a lialf

 knots an hour in the opposite direction, tlieir motion through the water therefore
 being nearly four and a half knots an hour.

    The difference in the specific gravity of water obtained from different depths was
 usually found in Capt. Wharton's investigations (as in the author'sj to afford, imder
 ordinary circumstances, a very sure indication of the direction of the move-
 ment of each stratum ; the heavy water of the iEgean ffowing ?V(wards, and the
 light water of the Black Sea 02</wards. And it was indicated alike by both modes
 of inquiry, that the two strata move in opposite directions, one over the other,

 with very little intermixture or retardation, the passage from the one to the other
 being usually very abrupt. In a few instances there was a departure from the

middle stratum was moving inwards, though the water of both these strata had the
lensity of the ^Egean. These anomalies are considered by Capt. Wharton to pro-
ceed from the prevalence of opposite winds at the two ends of the Strait.

   As a general rule, the strength of the wward undercurrent was proportioned
to that of the o«<<ward surface-current ; and this was very remarkably shown in
cases in which, both having been slack during a calm, an increase of wind aug-

mented the rates of both cuiTents alike. That a vdnd blowing o«<iwards should

promote the flow of an undercm-rent wjwards, may at first sight appear anomalous
but it is veiy easily accounted for. Suppose that a moderate S.W. wind, by
checking the surface-outflow, keeps the level of the Black Sea just so much above
that of the ^gean that the greater iceicjht of the latter column is counterpoised

by the greater height of the former ; then, as the hottoin pressures of the two are

equal, their lateral pressures will also be equal, and there will be no undercurrent
so long as this condition lasts. But so soon as, on the cessation of the S.W.

wind, the level of the Black Sea is lowered by a surface-outflow, the ^gean

column comes to be the heavier, and its excess of lateral pressure produces a deep

inflow. And when this out^o-w is further aided by a N.E. wind, so that the levels

of the two seas are equalized, or there is even an excess of elevation at the yEgean
end, the greater weight of the vEgean column will produce a greater lateral pres-
sure, and will consequently increase the force of the i/(ward undercurrent.

   The result of this experimentum crucis may be fairly considered to have clearly

--shown that a slight excess of dowmvard pressure whether arising from difference
--of specific gravity, or from difference of level is quite adequate to produce move-

ment in great bodies of water, which movement may have the rate and force of a
cwrent when restricted to a narrow channel. And the " creeping-flow " of Polar

water along the Ocean-bottom, which, on Dr. Carpenter's theory of Oceanic

circulation, brings a glacial temperature into the Intertropical zone, is thus found
to have an adequate vera causa in the excess of deep lateral pressure exerted by the
Polar column, whose density has been augmented by cold, over that of the Equa-

--torial column, whose density has been diminished by heat, the levels of the two

columns being assumed to be the same.

     Lunar Influence on Cflouds and Rain. Btj J. Park Hakeison, M.A.
   On tabulating the mean quantities of cloud at Greenwich in 1871 according to
the age of the moon, the results agreed generally with the mean rainfall on certain

days of the lunation as ascertained by Mr. Chase, an American savant, and Mr.
Hennessj', at Mussoorie, in India. The author pointed out the necessity of obtain-
ing special observations, not only of the amount of cloud, but also its height above
the earth, before any certain conclusions as to the fuU extent of lunar influence on

the atmosphere, and consequently on air-temperature, can be arrived at. He had

shown in former communications that temperature is sensibly afiected by the moon.

                    On the Passage of Squalls across the British Isles.
         By G. M. Whipple, B.Sc, F.R.A.S., of the Keiv Observatory.

   After exhibiting the uncertainty attendant upon investigation of meteorological
laws by the aid of observations made over a small part of the earth's surface like
the British Isles, owing to tlie want of well-marked characteristics which would
serve to identify and track out masses of air moving over the couutiy, the author
calls attention to squalls which, occurring abruptly and presenting certain definite
features, are recorded in a conspicuous manner by self-registering meteorological
instruments when they pass over them.

   The appearance of the instrumental curves at the time of a squall was described
and illustrated by means of tracings from the Quarterly Weather Reports of the
Meteorological Committee ; and a table was given showing a brief history of twenty-

three squalls, registered in the Reports from 18G9-73.

   From this it appeared that their motion is almost invariably in a direction from

westward to eastward, with a velocity diminishing as they progress.
   The velocity of the easterly motion is sometimes as high as 100 miles per hour,

and falls as low as 10 miles, the average rate given by the whole series being 38

miles per hour.

   Refen-ing to other papers which have appeared on these phenomena, the author
suggests that use might with advantage be made of a better knowledge of squalls
in issuing storm warnings.

 On an Improvement in the Sextant. By Capt. J. E. Davis, B.N., F.E.G.S.

    This small adaptation to the sextant is intended principally to facilitate the taking
observations of heavenly bodies, of course with the view of fixing positions, rating
chronometers, &c. It consists of two parts, viz. the micrometer and the indicator.

The micrometer is simply a toothed wheel attached to the tangent-screw ; and to
the arm of the sextant is attached a pawl or click, adapted to the toothed wheel.
Each tooth represents one tenth of the circumference or turn of the tangent-screw
so that (presuming the tangent-screw to be correct) whatever alteration one turn
of the screw makes in the reading on the arc, each click represents exactly one
tenth of that movement ; thus, if one turn of the screw moves the vernier 20
minutes, each click moves it exactly 2.

   The indicators are two movable brass slides, one placed before the arm, the

other behind the arm of the sextant, and capable of being clamped firmly. By

means of these there is no necessity to read off the observations at the time of

observing.

   The micrometer movement can be disconnected at pleasure by means of a small
eccentric, which lifts the pawl.

   In using the sextant, if the heavenly body is rising, the indicator behind the arm
is moved with the arm in bringing the reflected image down ; and before it comes
into contact either with the horizon or its own reflection in the artificial horizon, the
arm is clamped, and the indicator also. The first contact is the first observation. The
tangent-screw is then quickly turned one or two clicks ; this opens or separates the
two images, which; on coming into contact again, form the second observation ; and

so on.
                                                                                  TRANSACTIONS OF THE SliCTIONS.                                                                                                              45

--The advantages claimed for this little invention are :

1. Simplicity in the mode of observing-. The author maintains that observations

can be more perfectly made with a sextant by allowing the objects to come into con-

tact, and noting the moment of contact, than by bringing them into contact and

noting that time                                                                  thus the observations of the traveller inexperienced in                                                                                the  use
                                                                               ;

of the instrument will prove of more value by this mode of observing than by that

usually followed.

 --2. In star observations. Every observer knows full well the difficulty attending

taking star observations, the trouble in keeping the lamp trimmed, then that of bring-

ing the focus of the light on to the vernier in reading off, and the delay consequent.

There is also a phj'sical difficulty                                                                                                                                                                                     viz., in obsen'iug, the pupil of the eye has to be
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

dilated to take in the greatest possible quantity of light, and suddenly contracted to

exclude it in reading off, to be as suddenly changed again. These difficulties, the

author believes, are avoided by this simple adaptation. If circummeridian alti-

tudes are being_ observed, all the altitudes before and after crossing the meridian

are equal                                             and if it be necessary to record the meridian altitude itself (which may
                                                   ;

occur between the clicks), it can be done by the indicator before the arm ; but the

meridian altitude is not absolutely necessary.

   3. Two sets of star observations can be made by the same sextant without reading

--off, provided their altitudes are not the same. Having taken the iirst set Csay the

one with the lowest altitude), the indicator behind the arm is left to record it, and

the indicator before the arm will record the other.

 --4. In equal altitudes of the sun, before and after noon, for time. After taking

those in the forenoon, the sextant may be left until the last observation taken comes

--on in P.M., and the altitudes respectively worked back to the first of the forenoon.
   5. In lunar observations. Every observer of limar distances on board ship knows

the difficulty attending taking these observations. When there is much movement

in the vessel it takes some time to get the sextant on ; but when once it is got on

the proper angle, he can keep the objects in contact. By means of the micrometer

he is not necessitated to remove the sextant from the eye, and can go on taking his

distances ad libitum.

6. In thick or cloudy, or even rainy weather, when a heavenly body can only be

seen for a short time, the observer is not dependent on one observation, but can

--Atake a set in less time than he could one or two by the ordinary process.
7. The check on the time-taker.                                                                                                                                                                                          good observer has a difficulty in checking

his time-taker. The process to detect error is rather long and complicated ; but the

measurements of arc being equal by the micrometer, an error in time is at once

detected.

 --8. In nautical surveying. The indicator attached to the ordinary sounding quin-

tant will prove useful by enabling the two angles, to tix a position, being taken

without removing the sextant from the eye, and thus avoiding the necessity of

having two obseners (often necessary), or the use of a double sextant.

          On an Instrument for the Composition of two Harmonic Curves.
            By A. E. DoNKiN, M.A., FeJhiv of Exeter College, Oxford.

   Sincea simple harmonic curve may be regarded as the cm-ve of pressure on the
tympanic membrane when the ear "is under the influence of a simple tone, a
curve compounded in the ordinary way of two such harmonic curves will be the
curve of pressure for the consonance of the two tones which they severally

represent.

    Hence a machine which has for its object the composition of two harmonic
"curves, possesses the means for rendering distinctly visible to the eye the effect on the
ear of the consonance of auA' two simple tones.

    If a pencil-point performs rectilinear harmonic vibrations upon a sheet of paper
moving uniformly at right angles to the direction of these vibrations, it describes a

simple harmonic curve. If there be now given to the paper, in addition to its con-

tinuous transverse motion, a \ibratory motion similar and parallel to that which
the pencil has, a complicated curve will be the result, whose form will depend on
--46 REPORT 1873.

tlie ratio of the numbers of vibrations in a given time of the pencil and paper, and

which will be the curve of pressure for the interval corresponding to this ratio.
The way in which the machine combines these three motions is as follows. There

are two vertical spindles capable of revolving in a horizontal plate. At the lower

end of each a crank is fixed ; and at the upper end of each a toothed wheel can be

screwed on : this pair of wheels can be connected by a third intermediate one.

The paper upon which the curve is to be drawn is carried upon a rectangular

frame, capable of sliding horizontally up and down. The frame has a pair of hori-

zontal rollers at each end, between which the paper passes as the rollers turn ; and

a uniform motion is given to them by means of a long pinion working into the

teeth of a wheel fixed on one of them, and up and down which the frame slides.

AThis long pinion is turned by one of the vertical spindles.  connecting-rod is

carried from the crank of this spindle to the frame, by means of which a vibratory

motion is communicated to the latter, which motion, though not truly har-

monic, is, owing to the length of the connecting-rod and small radius of the

Acrank, quite sufficiently so for practical purposes.  similar and parallel motion is

given to a small glass pen Ijy means of a connecting-rod from the other crank.

This pen is so arranged as to rest upright with its point upon the paper. If the

intermediate wheel be now put into gear with those on the spindles, and either of

them tm-ned by a winch provided for the pm'pose, a curve corresponding to the

ratio of the numbers of teeth on the spindle-wheels will immediately be dra'wn.

The general form of equation to the curves which the instrument can produce

will evidently be

                   y=a sin {jnx-\-a)-\-h sin (/M'-|-i3).

Here a and h are the radii of the cranks, which can be altered at pleasure from to
half an inch ; in and n are limited by the numbers of teeth of the wheels with which

the instrument is provided, while a and /3 depend on the phases of the cranks, i. e.
the relative position they are in with respect to the vertical plane passing through

their axes when the intermediate wheel is brought into gear with them.

  As an example, by taking =7h .54, «=27, « = J=half an inch, the curve drawn

will be that corresponding to an octave. Substituting a wheel of 55 teeth for that

of 54, the curve alters its form to that representing an octave out of tune. Again,
the numbers 48 and 45, which have the ratio \j, woidd give the curve corresponding
to a diatonic semitone. The form of this curve, as of all others where the ratio
approaches unity, shows very distinctly the beats which would ensue upon sotmding

the corresponding consonance.

    Since it is possible to vary the radii of the cranks at pleasure, the curves corre-

sponding to the consonance of two tones of unequal intensity can also be drawn.
The length of paper within which the period of any curve is contained depends on
the rate at which the rollers tm-n. Since this can be regulated at pleasure, by means

contrived for the purpose, the curves may be either extended or compressed ; that
is, the period may be made either long or short. The general form of any curve,
however, is better seen in the latter case. The maximum width of contour in any
curve is equal to twice the sum of the radii of the cranks. Thus when these are

each half an inch, the curve will be two inches wide.
    The instrument is constructed by Messrs. Tisley and Spiller, of Brompton Road,

to whom several improvements on the original model are due.

On an Improved Form of Aneroid for determining Heights, with a means
  of adjusting the Altitude-scale for various Temperatures. By Rogers

   Field, B.A.

   The author begins by stating that the object aimed at in designing this improved
form of aneroid was to simplify the correct determination of altitudes in cases such
as ordinarily occiu- in England, and that the instrument is therefore arranged to
suit moderate elevations, say of 2000 feet and under, and is not intended for consi-

derable elevations.

   The table which is adopted in graduating the aneroid described is that given
                    TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              47

by tlie Astronomer Royal in the ' Proceedings of the Meteorological Society,' vol.
iii. page 406, and gives results which lie between those of other authorities.

 --Aneroids constructed for tlie determination of elevations by readings from analti-

tude-scale consist of two classes one in which the altitude-scale is fixed and the
other in which it is movable. The first class of aneroid, with a fixed scale, is

accurate in principle ; but the scale only allows for one of the conditions which
have to be taken into account, viz. the varying pressure of the atmosphere ; and the

other condition or temperature of the atmosphere has to be allowed for by calcula-
tion. The second class of aneroid, that with a movable scale, is radically wrong
in principle as ordinarily used, inasmuch as the movable scale must be graduated
for one fixed position of the zero ; and when the zero is shifted at random, accordino-
to the position of the hand of the instrument, the scale necessarily becomes inac-

curate.

In the improved aneroid the scale of altitudes is movable, but, instead of being

shifted at random according to the position of the hand of the instrument, it is

moved into certain fixed positions according to the temperature of the atmosphere
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

so that the shifting of the scale answers the same purpose as if the original scale

were altered to suit the various temperatures of the atmosphere. The aneroid is

graduated for inches in the usual way on the face                                                                                                                                                                                                                          but the graduation only extends
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

from 31 to 27 inches, so as to preserve an open scale. The outer movable scale is

graduated in feet for altitudes; and the graduation is laid down by fixing the zero

opposite .31 inches. This is the normal position of the scale ; and it is then correct

for a temperature of 50° Fahr. For temperatures below 50° the zero of the scale is

moved below 31 inches ; and for temperatures above 50° the zero of the scale is

moved    above  31  inches                                 the  exact  position of the                                                                                                                                                                                     zero for diiferent  temperatures

has been determined partly by calculation, and partly by trial, and marked on the

rim of the aneroid. In order to ensure the altitude-scale not being shifted after it

has once been set in its proper position, there is a special contrivance for locking it

in the various positions. The altitudes are in all cases determined by taking two

readings, one at each station, and then subtracting the reading at the lower station

from that at the upper.

   The movable scale requires to be set for temperatures before taking any obser-
vation, and not shifted during the progress of the observations. This wiU practi-
cally not give any inconvenience in the case of moderate altitudes, as small
variations of temperature will not appreciably affect the result ; and so long as the
temperature does not vary during the course of the observations more than 5°
from that at which the instrument is set, the result may be accepted as practically

correct.

   In conclusion the author states that the principle of allowing for the variations

of temperature of the atmosphere by shifting the altitude-scale, does not profess to

be theoretically accurate, but simply sufficiently accurate for practical purposes. In

order to satisfy himself that this was the case, the author carefully compared

the readings obtained for diilerent temperatures from the shifted scale with the
correct readings as given by calculation from the normal position of the scale

and found that the maximum error was 2 feet and the average error under 1 foot'
errors which are perfectly inappreciable. The instrument was constructed by

Mr. Casella, of Ilolborn Bars, London.

  On Eckhold's Omnimeter, a new Surveying-Instrument. By G. "W. Hope.

     On Negretti and Zambia's Test-gauge Solar-Radiation Thermometer.
                                       By G. J. Stmons.

   Meteorologists have long been endeavouring to obtain an instrument whereby
comparable observations of the amount of solar radiation could be made. Various

experiments and observations by the Rev. F. W. Stow, the late F. Nunes, Esq.

M.A., and the author have shown that this object is attained by the use of a mer-

curial maximum thermometer, of which the bulb and one inch of the stem are
--48 REPORT 1873.

coated with dull black, which thermometer is enclosed in a glass jacket, the bulb
being in the centre of a sphere of not less than two inches diameter, and fi-om
which jacket nearly all the air has been exhausted. To all thermometers thus
mounted the title of vacuum thermometer has been applied. It has, however, been
found that the amount of exhaustion varies considerably, and that the indications
of the thermometer are thereby greatly affected. Yet the instruments hitherto
made have been indiscriminately sold and used, and no ready means have been
available for determining the amount of air left in.

   The speciality of the instrument now exhibited is, that a small vacuum-gauge is

inserted in the jacket, so that the precise extent to which the exhaustion has been
carried can be seen at any time, and strict comparability in this important respect

ensured.

On a Oomjyound-Pendulum Apparatus. By S. C. Tisley.

This apparatus was originally designed for the purpose of recording the figures

shown in Lissajous's experiments vdth. tuning-forks.

The method of obtaining the vibrations is by means of two pendulums, which

work upon knife-edges, the supports being secured to two sides of a piece of maho-

gany, so that the pendulums swing at right angles to eiich other. The pendulums

are about 3 feet long, and are continued above their supports about 8 inches,

finishing at their tops in ball-and-socket joints. \\'we arms are screwed into the

ball-and-sockets, and connected with a pen or tracer. When at rest, the two pen-

dulums and tracer are at three corners of a square. One pendulum has two sliding

pans for holding weights, one above the point of suspension and one below ; the

other pendulum has two sliding pans, but both below the point of suspension ; four

weights are generally used, each weighing about "2^ lbs.

  When a single weight is placed on eacli of the bottom pans and properlj^ ad-

justed, the vibrations of the two pendulums being equal, the figure formed by the

tracer wiU be an elliptical spiral, gradually dying out so as to produce a watch-

Aspring-shaped curve.  small sliding weight is attached to the first pendulum  ;

and by moving this up or down, the viljrations can be brought perfectly into unison,

or thrown slightly out of time, thus producing through the tracer a variety of com-
plicated and interesting figures. The second pan is used for varying the rates of

vibration of the two pendulums in certain ratios, so as to produce curves of diflerent

Acharacters.  variety of tracings illustrating this were exhibited.

The use of the pan above the point of suspension is of great value, as it gives a

ready means of altering the proportions. Thus by moving the weight {21 lbs.) from
a pan below to one above the point of suspension, and placing a balance-weight of
A lb. on the lower pan, the pendidums having originally been adjusted for unison,

the resulting vibrations will be in the ratios of 3 to 1 ; and if they had been ad-
justed to 3 to 2, the result would be 2 to 1, and so on.

In the table under the tracer a glass plate is let in, so that, by placing a reflector

below and above, a light can be thrown through the object, and a magnified image

produced on the screen during its formation; in that case blackened glass and a

needle-point for tracer are used.

                         Bij Professor A. S. Heeschel, B.A., F.R.A.S.

   The contrivance exhibited originally presented itself to the author at the Obser-
vatory of R. S. Newall, Esq., Gateshead-upon-Tyne, where the observing-chair is
supported bv a counterpoise consisting of a horizontal iron bar loaded with weights,
and fastened at its two ends to wire ropes, which, passing over two pulleys, support

the chair. When the chair-frame was moved, the two ends of this pendulum

--showed themselves to be capable of three modes of vibration one longitudinal (in

the direction of the bar's length), and two transversal ones proceeding from the
bar's displacement either angularly about its middle point or parallel to itself.
The combination of the first two of these movements together made the end of the

swinging bar describe compound vibration-curves of the form known as Lissajous's,

of great regularity and distinctness, and was suggested to the author by Mr.

WNewall as a new means of tracing them. In the new instrument the horizontal

bar is hung by four strings forming a ; and the outer pairs are nipped together

at equal distances from the rod at whatever height above it gives the desired

period of its longitudinal vibrations. Its transversal vibrations are of two kinds,

either of bifilar torsion, or of simple lateral oscillation about the three upper points

of suspension. The points of attachment on the bar are a little above its axis, which

passes through the centre of gravity of a large fixed weight at its middle point

two smaller sliding weights, moved along it, regulate the rate of its angular oscilla-

--tions. The new pendulum possesses a fourth mode of vibration of rotation round

--the line of attachment in the bar, like the rolling of a ship at sea a condition of

oscillation very similar to one which was lately ingeniously employed to illustrate

that problem by Sir William Thomson. If the bar " rights " quickly round this

axis, these small rolling oscillations do not accumulate very greatly, and soon dis-

appear ; but if they are nearly of the same period as the principal transverse vibra-

tion, thej' are so large and persistent as entirely to disturb the regularity of the

Acurves.      glass pen fixed to the end of the bar traces Lissajous's cm-ves by com-

bining the longitudinal with either of the two transversal vibrations. When both

of the latter act together, wavy modifications of Lissajous's cun'es are produced,

which present cusps, stationary points, and other interesting varieties of form [of

which some illustrations were exhibited]. Their general expression is given oy

the equations

               = Ax\ cos (a -\- at)
               = B(«/ sm{b+^t) + Csm(c+yt),

which only differ from those of Lissajous's curves by the addition of a second in-
dependent term at the end of the last equation.

On the Influence of Temperature on the Elastic Force of certain forms of Springs.
                                   By F. H. Wenham,

The author stated that the value of springs in the form of elastic plates or rods

subject to deflection or torsion, in the construction of instruments for measuring

and regulating force, temperature, and time, depends upon the law that the degrees

of motion are equal to the forces, and that this equality of force and motion is

identified with the tiine in which those motions are performed ; for the vibration of

certain forms of springs is performed in the same time, whether the degi-ee of motion

is great or small : such a spring will give the same musical note at all ranges, and

have the important property of isochronism, as illustrated in the balance-springs of

chronometers, meaning that the time is the same at all ranges in the arc of \'ibration.
The author pointed out that the form of balance-spring commonly used in time-

pieces is not strictly isochronal ; for bej'ond one revolution the forces are unequal,

increasing during winding and decreasing in the opposite extreme of uncoiling, but

that in the acting range of vibration of these instruments the differences were not

appreciable.

Instruments for measuring force, temperature, or time, such as aneroid barometers,

thermometers, or chronometers, the accuracy of whose indications depends upon the

uniform elasticity of springs, require a compensation to counteract the loss of elas-

Aticity by increase of temperature. number of experiments were tried and detailed

by the author, in order to determine a law to enable the compensations to be

effected definitely. The materials experimented upon were steel, hardened and

tempered, crown-glass, brass, and germau silver highly condensed by hammering.

These materials, while under various degrees of compression, were subjected to

temperatures ranging up to 500° ; but it was found that the loss of elasticity did not

correspond in a regular ratio with the increase of heat; for example, in a steel

spring each hundred degrees from 100° to 500° caused deflections in the ratio of 13,

16, 40, and 52 ; and, in first experiments, when the springs had cooled they did not
return to their normal point with the pressure remaining the same, but had acquired

a permanent set, wliicli was great at first (in an untried material), but became less
by repetitions of the experiments.

   With hard lianuuered german silver the set at Jirst much exceeded that of steel,

being equal to one-third of the compression, but after four repetitions of the expe-
riment amounted to only one twenty-seventh. This metal, unlike steel, indicated
equal deflections -with equal degrees of heat, showing that, in instruments where it
could be used, no secondary compensation would be required, because the ratio is

6 ;£ual for mean aud extreme temperatures.
    These experiments demonstrate, in regard to any instrument for indicating and

registering weight, pressure, temperature, or time by means of the law of elasticity,
the importance of subjecting the material (whether steel, glass, or particularly any
metal in which this property is obtained by condensation or hammering) to an
excess of temperature before the graduations and adjustments are made.

On a New Form of Rutherford's Minimum Tliermometer, devised and con-
   structed hy Mr. James Hicks. By G. M. Whipple, B.Sc, I.B.A.S., of
   the Kew Observatory.

    INIany different kinds of thermometers have been constructed for the purpose of
indicating the lowest temperature of the air during a given time ; but none has been

found to fuliil the desired object so well as the common or Rutherford spirit-

thermometer.

   The chief objection to the use of this instrument is found to be in the fact that
the spirit-thermometer cannot follow sudden variations of temperature so quickly
as the mercurial thermometer ; hence, on occasions when rapid changes occur, the
indications of the two instruments are not accordant.

    In the thermometer exhibited Mr. Hicks has in a great measure succeeded in
overcoming this difficulty by the device of largely increasing the surface of the bulb
exposed to the air, whilst at the same time he greatly reduces its cubical contents.

    In 1862 Mr. Beckley suggested the formation of thermometer-bulbs on the pat^

tern of certain bottles, in which the bottom is forced up a long way into the body,
and Mr. Hicks constructed a mercurial thermometer, which was shown in the In-

ternational Exhibition. Practical difficulties, however, obstructing the manufacture
of this kind of thermometer, very few have been made. Recently Mr. Hicks

endeavoured to make spirit-thermometers upon the same principle, and having
succeeded can now construct bulbs in the form of a hoUowed-out cylinder, with the

film of spirit reduced to any degree of tenuity.
    In order to determine the relative advantages of the old- and new-pattern ther-

mometers, experiments have been made at the Kew Observatory, which show that

the time Hicks's minimum thermometer requires to fall through 25° Fahr. is
55 seconds, whilst a common spherical-bulb minimum takes 2 minutes 25 seconds

to fall through the same extent of scale ; and Hicks's rises 25" in 57 seconds, the
other thermometer occupying 2 minutes 24 seconds to rise through the same in-

 terval.

   An improved form of the instrument has the bulb in the form of a double tube

open at both ends, allowing free passage of the air through it.

                            Oyi a New Electrical Anemograph.
          By G. M. Whipple, B.Sc, F.R.A.S., of the Kew Observatory.

    Amongst the numerous instruments which have been devised for recording con-
tinuously and automatically the velocity and direction of the wind, none has met
with more general adoption than the form known as the Beckley or Kew-pattem
 Anemograph.

    This instrument was originally constructed in 1857, by a grant from the British
 Association ; and a detailed description of it, with Plates, is to be found in the Report

 of the Association for the year 1858.

    Some minor modifications found necessary having been introduced into the in-
 strument, it was accepted by the Meteorological Committee ; and it is now employed
             TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.    51

by them in their observatories, its essential features being- identical with the 1858

instrument.

Experience has shown that under most circumstances the working of this instru-

ment leaves but little to be desired, but that in situations where it is necessary

to place the recording-apparatus at a considerable distance from the external

driving parts of the instrument its action is subject to irregularities, due principally

to the yielding of the long, light shafts which have then to be employed ; and it is

to meet such cases that the modification now brought before the Association has

been devised by me.

  No originality is to be found in the adaptation of electricity to the purpose of

registering the ^vind numerous arrangements have been made by which it can be
                                                                                                                ;

accomplished. I need only allude to Secchi, Crossley, Gordon, Hall, and others

who have constructed instruments which do it.

  myIn plan for the velocity-recording apparatus, where rotation in one direction

only is required, I employ, first, a simple contact-making key, on the shaft car-

rying the Robinson's cups, which transmits a short current every time the cups

complete a revolution. This current is then led by means of a wire to the

recording-apparatus placed at any distance ; and there, by means of an arrangement
of electromagnets and escapement similar to that employed in the step-by-step

telegraph instrument, successive currents produce the continuous rotation of a

wheel.

   This wheel being put into connexion with the train of wheelwork at present
existing, eventually drives the pencil round and recoi'ds the wind's movement

upon the paper.

  --The Direction-apparatus. Registration of the wind's direction by means of

electricity is somewhat difficult of execution by reason of the fact that rotation of

the wind-vane occurs sometimes in a positive or right-handed direction, veering

from and through E. and S., and sometimes vice versa, or from N. through W. to 8.

   Various plans have been devised for accomplishing the thing desired, requiring

wires varying in number from four to thirty-tsvo. In the instrument now described

two only are needed, one of which is employed to transmit the rotary motion of tlie

vane to the recording-pencil, the other determining the direction in which the

rotation is to take place.

  A toothed wheel in electrical communication with a battery is fixed upon the

vane-spindle, and a contact-breaker so arranged that a current is sent to the re-

cording-apparatus every time a tooth passes.

Every current transmitted causes a wheel in the registering-apparatus to rotate

through a small arc, always of course in the same direction.
   In order to record buckinr/ of the wind, the second wire must be made use of.

Above the contact-making wheel on the vane-spindle, and turning loosely in it, a

small insulated metallic collar is fitted, immediately over which there is a metal

disk fastened to and turning with the shaft; a stud projecting from the underside

of this disk plays between two stops on the collar, one of which is a conductor, the

other being an insulator.

The play of the stud between the two stops is merely sufficient to make and

break the electrical contact.

The wire from the metallic stop is led to an electromagnet fixed above the

Arecording-apparatus.      lever-clutch, moved by the armature of the magnet, acts

upon the driving-spindle of the pencil cylinder, raising it when a current passes, and

so bringing the lower of two mitre wheels fixed iipon the spindle into gear with

the mitre wheel turning the cylinder, on its under side, and causing it to rotate

when the spindle is turned. When the current is discontinued, a spring draws the

spindle downwards, and the top mitre wheel is brought into gear with the upper

side of the pencil-wheel, whilst the lower one is set free; continued rotation of the

spindle has now the effect of turning the pencil in the reverse direction to that

in which it was previously moving.

Under ordinary circumstances this will be the position maintained ; the vane-stud

being in contact with the insulating stop, no current passes ; should, however, the

wind veer against the sun, the movement of the vane will make electrical contact,

the sliding shaft be lifted, and, the lower wheel coming into gear, the rotation of
                                                                                                         4*
--52 REPORT 1873.

the shaft under the action of the second wire and contact-breaker will be trans-

mitted to the pencil, and cause it to turn in the direction W. through S. to E.

instead of the reverse.

   It is necessary to make the fittings so exact that no movement of the shaft

can occur without a corresponding motion of the pencil ; otherwise the orientation
of the instrument would be rendered incorrect.

   The instrument above described has not yet been constructed ; hence no informa-
tion can be given as to battery power necessary to work it. Probably very little
would suffice ; for as tlie rotation of both shafts is continuous and in the same sense,
the whole actual work of moving the pencils over the paper could easily be per-
formed by a small weight or spring suitably arranged.

On an improved form of OxyJiydrogen Lantern for the use of Lecturers.

                           By C. J. WooDWAKD, jB./S'c.

   The author stated that the form of oxyhydrogen lantern generally used by
lecturers was merely the old magic lantern, and this was not sufficient for the many

requirements of the lecturer of the present day. What was required was a light

lantern which would direct a beam in any direction whatever, and which would

not only serve to show photographs and slides, but would do also for exhibiting

experiments such as electrolysis of liquids, magnetic curves, cohesion-figures, &c.

The instrument the author exhibited consists of a small lanteni swinging between

two uprights. It can be clamped at any angle ; and as the stand is one capable of
rotating, the lantern can be made to project a beam of light in any direction. The

stool of the lantern is constructed on the principle of Willis's apparatus for lecturers

on mechanics ; and to this is fastened carriers for a table to support a prism or other

Apiece of apparatus.  projecting bar serves to hold the lenses, which slide on the

bar and can be turned out of the way in a moment. The lantern was made for the

author by Messrs. E. Field & Co., of Birmingham.

  A description of the Instrument, -with woodcuts, will be found in the ' Engineer,'

vol. xxxvi. p. 284.

      Address by W. J. Russell, Ph.D., F.B.S., President of the Section,

Of late years it has been the custom of my predecessors in this chair to open

the business of the Section with an address, and the subject of this address has
almost invariably been a review of the progi-ess of Chemistry during the past year
I purpose, with your leave, to-day to deviate somewhat from this precedent, and

to limit my remarks, as far as the progress of Chemistiy is concerned, to the his-

tory of one chemical substance. The interest and the use of an annual sun-ey at
these meetings of the progress of Chemistry has to a certain extent passed away
for the admirable abstracts of all important chemical papers now published by the
Chemical Society has in a great measure taken its place, and otiers to the che-
mical student a much more thorough means of learning what progress his science
is making than could possibly be done by the study of a presidential address.
Doubtless these abstracts of chemical papers are known to others than professional
chemists; but I cannot pass tliem over without recording the great use they have
proved to be, how much they have done already in extending in this country an
exact knowledge of the progress of science on the Continent, and in helping and
in stimulating those who are engaged in scientific pursuits in this coimtry. I
believe few gi-ants made by this Association have done more real good than those
which have enabled the Chemical Society to publish these abstracts.

   I dwell for a moment on the doings of the Chemical Society for I believe in the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

progress of this Society we have a most important indication of the progress of

chemical science in this country. The number of original papers communicated to

the Society during the last year has far exceeded tliat of previous years ; during

last year fifty-eight papers were read to the Society, whereas the average number

for the last three years is only twenty-nine. Fm-ther, I may say there is every

appearance of this increased activity not only continuing but even increasing.

Another matter connected with the Society deserves a passing word : I mean its
removal from its old rooms at Burlington House, which afforded it very insufficient
accommodation, to its new ones in the same building. This transference, which is
now taking place, will give to the Society a great increase of accommodation, and

thus admit of larger audiences attending the lectures, of the proper development
of the library, and of the full illustration, by experiment, of the communications

made to it. These improvements must act most beneticially on the Society, and
stimulate its future development. Even now it numbers some 700 members, and
certainly is not one of the least active or least useful of the many scientific societies

in London.

   Since our last Meeting at Brighton we have lost the most renowned of modern

chemists, Liebig. His intiueuce on chemistry through a long and most active life

has yet to be written. Publishing his first paper fifty years ago, it is difficult for
chemists of the present day to realize the changes in chemical thought, in chemical
knowledge, and in chemical experiment which he lived through, and was, more

than any other chemist, active in promoting. His activity was unwearied; he
communicated no less than 317 papers to difierent scientific journals; and almost

every branch of chemistry received some impetus from his hand.
   Liebig took an active interest in this Association ; and I believe the last paper he

wrote was one in answer to a communication made at the Inst Meeting of this
Association. On two occasions he attended Meetings of the British Association,
and has communicated many papers to this Section. The Meeting at Liverpool in
1837 was the first at which he was present ; he then communicated to this Section
a paper on the products of the decomposition of Uric Acid, and, further, gave an
account of his most important discovery, made in conjunction with Wohler, of the
artificial formation of Urea. At this JNleeting Liebig was requested to prepare a
report on the state of our knowledge of isomeric bodies. This request, although

often repeated, was never complied with. He was also requested to report on the

state of Organic Chemistry and Organic Analysis; thus our Section was evidently
desirous of giving him full occupation. At the Meeting in 1840, at Glasgow, a
paper on Poisons, Contagions, and Miasms, by Liebig, was read ; it was, in fact, an

abstract of the last chapter in his book on Chemistry in its applications to Agi-icul-
ture and Physiology ; and the work itself appeared about the same time, dedicated

--to this Association. In his dedication Liebig says: "At one of the meetings of

the Chemical Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, -
the honourable task of preparing a Report upon the State of Organic Chemistry
was imposed upon me. In this present work 1 present the Association with a part

of this Report."

   At the next Meeting, which was at Plymouth in 1841, there was an interesting
letter from Liebig to Dr. Playfair, read to our Section ; in it, among other matters,

Liebig describes an " excellent method," devised by Drs. ^Vill and Varrentrapp, for

determining the amount of nitrogen in organic bodies: he also says, "we have re-
peated all the experiments of Dr. Brown on the production of silicon from paracya-
uogen, but we have not been able to confirm one of his results ; what our experi-

ments prove is, that paracj'anogen is decomposed by a strong heat into nitrogen
gas and a residue of carbon,' which is exceedingly difficult of combustion,"

   To the next Meeting (which was at Manchester, and Dalton was the President
of this Section) Dr. Playfair communicated an abstract of Prof. Liebig's report on

Organic Chemistry applied to Physiology and Pathology : this abstract is printed in
our ' Proceedings ;' and the complete work is looked upon as the second pait of the

report on Organic Chemistry. This Association may therefore fairly consider that

it exercised some influence on Liebig in the production of the most important
works that he wrote. Playfair's abstract must have been listened to with the greatest
interest ; and I doubt not the statements made were sharply criticised, especially

by the physiologists then at Manchester. Playfair concludes his abstract in these
--54 REPOHT 1873.

--words, thus summing up the special objects of these reports: "In the opinion of

all, Liebig may be considered a benefactor to his species for the interesting dis-
coveries iu agriculture published by him in the hist part of this report. And
liaving in that pointed out means by which the food of the human race may be
increased, in the work now before us he follows up the chain in its continuation,
and shows how that food may best be adapted to the nutrition of man. Surely

there are no two subjects more fitted than these for the contemplation of the phi-

losopher                                    and by the consummate sagacity with which Liebig has applied to their
                                         ;

elucidation the powers of his mind, we are compelled to admit that there is no

living philosopher to whom the Chemical Section could have more appropriately

entrusted their investigation."

At the Meeting at (jlasgow in 1855 Liebig was also present; but he then only

communicated to this Section a short paper on fulmiuuric acid, and some remarks

on the use of lime-water in the manufacture of bread.

   Such, I believe, is the history of the direct relationship which has existed

between Liebig and this Association. Indirectly we can hardly recogTiize how

3niich we owe to him. Interested as he ever was iu the work of this Association, I

could not but to-day record the instances of direct aid and support which this

Section has received from him.

   I pass on now to the special subject to which I wish to ask your attention. It

is the histoi-y of the vegetable colouring-matter found in madder : it has been in

use from time inimemoiial, and is still one of the commonest and most important of
(lyes; it is obtained from a plant largely cultivated iu many parts of the world for
the sake of the colour it yields ; and the special interest which now attaches to it is

--that the chemist has lately sliown how this natural colouring-matter can be made

in the laboratory as well as iu the fields how by using a bj'-product which for-

merly was without value, thousands of acres can be liberated for the cultivation of

other crops, and the colouring-matter which they formerly produced be cheaper

and better prepared iu tlie laboratory or in the manufactory. That a certain

colouring-matter could be obtained from the roots of the Rtibia tinctorum and other

species of tlie same plant has been so long known that apparently no record of its
discovery remains. Pliny and Dioscorides evidently allude to it. The former, re-
ferring to its value as a dyeing material, says :--" It is a plant little known, except

--to the sordid and avaricious and this because of the large profits obtained from
--it, owing to its employment in dyeing wool and leather." He further saj's : " The

madder of Italy is the most esteemed, and especially that grown iu the neighbour-

liood of liome, where and in other places it is produced iu great abundance." He

fiirther describes it as being grown among the olive-trees, or in fields devoted

especially to its growth. Tlie madder of Ravenna, according to Dioscorides, was

the most esteemed. Its cultivation in Italy has been continued tiU the present

time ; and in ISOo the Neapolitan provinces alone exported it to the value of ni'ire

than a quarter of a million sterling. At the present daj' we are all very familiar

with this colouriug-matter as the commonest that is applied to calicoes ; it is
capable of yielding many colours, such as red, pink, purple, chocolate, and black.
The plant which is the source of this colouring-matter is nearly allied, botanically

and in appearance, to the ordinary Galiums or Bedstraws. It is a native pro-

bably of Southern Europe as well as Asia. It is a perennial, with herbaceous

stem, which dies down every j'ear; its square-jointed stalk creeps along the ground

to a considerable distance ; and the stem and leaves are rough, with sharp prickles.
The root, which is cylindrical, fleshy, and of a pale yellow colour, extends down-

wards to a considerable depth ; it is from this root (which, when dried, is known as
madder) that the colom-ing-matter is obtained. The ])lant is propagated from

suckers or shoots ; these require some two or three years to come to full maturity

and yield the finest colours, although in France the crop is often gathered after

only eighteen months' growth. From its taking so long to develop, it is evidently

a crop not adapted to any ordinary series of rotation of crops. The plant thrives
best in a warm climate, but has been grown in this country and in the north of

Europe.

   In India it has been grown from the earliest times, and, as before stated, has
been abundantly cultivated in Italy certainly since the time of Pliny ; he also
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  00

mentions its cultivation in Galilee. In this country its culture has often been
attempted, and has been carried on for a short time, but noA'er with permanent

success. The madder now used in England is imported from France, Italy, Hol-
land, South Germany, Turkey, and India. In 18.57 the total amount imported
into this country was 4.34,056 cwt., having an estimated value of £1,284,989;
and the average annual amount imported during the last seventeen years is
310,042 cwt., while the amount imported last year (1872) was 283,274 cwt.,
valued at £922,244. In 1861 it was estimated that in the South Lancashire dis-

trict alone 150 tons of madder were used weekly, exclusive of that required for
preparing garancine. I quote these figures as showing the magnitude of the

industry that we are dealing with. Another point of much interest is the amount

of land required for the cultivation of this plant : hi England it was found that an
acre yielded only from 10 to 20 cwt. of the dried roots ; but in South Germany and
in France the same amount of land yields about twice tliat quantity. The madder-
cultivator digs up the roots in autumn, dries them, in some cases peels them by
beating them with a flail, and exports them in the form of powder, whole root, or
after treatment with sulphuric acid, when it is known as Garancine.

   The quality of the root varies much ; that from the Levant, and Imown as Tur-

key-root, is most valued. According, however, to the colour to be produced is
the madder from one source or another prefen-ed. To obtain the colouring-matter
(which is but very slightly soluble in water) from these roots, they are mixed, after
being ground, with waterin the dye-vessel, and sometimes a little chalk is added.
The fabric to be dyed is introduce"d, and the whole slowly heated ; the colouring-
matter gradually passes from the root to the water, and from the water to the
mordanted fabric, giving to it a colour dependent of course on the natm-e of the

mordant.

   To trace the chemical history of this colouring-matter we have to go back to
the year 1790, when a chemist of the name of Watt precipitated the colouring-

matter of madder by alum from neutral, alkaline, and acid solutions ; he obtained
two diflerent colouring-matters, but could not isolate them, and many different
shades of colour. Charles Batholdi asserted that madder contained much magnesic

sulphate ; and Hausmann observed the good effect produced on madder by the
addition of calcic carbonate. In 1823 F. Kuhlmann made evidently a careful
analysis of the madder-root, and describes a red and a fawn colouring-matter. But
the first really important advance made in our knowledge of the chemical consti-

tution of this colouring-matter was by Colin and Robiquet in 1827 ; they obtained

what they believed to be, and what has since really proved to be, the true colour-

ing principle of madder, and obtained it in a state of tolerable purity. Their
piocess for preparing it was very simple : they took Alsace madder in powder,
digested it with water, obtained thus a gelatinous mass, which they treated with
boiling alcohol, then evaporated off A of the alcohol, and treated the residue

with a little sulphuric acid to diminish its solubility ; then, after washing it with

several litres of water, they got a yellowish substance remaining. Lastly, they

foimd that, on moderately heating this product in a glass tube, they obtained a
yellowish vapour formed of brilliant particles, which condensed, giving a distinct
zone of brilliant needles reflecting a colour similar to that from the native lead

chromate. They named this substance alizarin, from the Levant name for madder,
alizari, the name by which it is still known there.

  A few years later we find other chemists attaclring this same subject. In 1831

Gaultier de Claubry and J. Persoz published the account of a long research on the
subject. They describe two coloiu'ing-matters, a red and a rose one : the red one

was alizarin ; and the rose one was another body nearly allied to it, and now well
known as purpurin. Runge also made an elaborate examination of the madder-

--root; he found no less than five different colouring-matters in it madder-red,

madder-purple, madder-orange, madder-yellow, and madder-brown. The first

three he considers to be suited for dyeing-purposes, but not so the last two. Rimge's

madder-red is essentially impure alizarin, and his madder-purple impure purpu-

rin. He does not give any analysis of these substances.

    During the next ten years this subject seems to have attracted but little atten-

tion from chemists; but in 1846 Shiel prepared the madder- red and madder-purple
--56 REPORT 1873.

of Runge by processes very similar to those employed by Runge, and analyzed
these substauces : for madder-red he gives the formula C^g Hi^ Og, which differs

only by H^O from the formula now adopted ; for the madder-purple he gives the

formula C^^HjoOu, and for the same substance after being sublimed CjHgO^. The

chemist who has worked most on this subject, and to whom we are principally

indebted for what we know with regard to the different constituents contained in

the madder-root, is Dr. Schunck, of Manchester. In Liebig's 'Annalen' for 1848

he gives a long and interesting account of his examination of madder; he isolates

and identifies several new substances, which are most important constituents of the
root, and has since that time added much to our knowledge of the chemical constitu-

tion of madder. In the paper above alluded to he confirms the presence of the alizarin,

and gives to it the formula CnHj^O^. The principal properties of this body may

best be sketched in here. Its volatility and brilliant crystalline appearance have

already been mentioned ; it is but slightly soluble in cold water, but much more so
in alcohol, in ether, and in boiling water. The colour of its solution is yellow
and when it separates out from a liquid it has a yellow flocculent appearance,

differing thus greatly from the red, brilliant, crystalline substance before described.

In order to obtain this latter body, heat had always been used ; so, until the ela-
borate experiments of Schunck, it was a question whether the heat did not produce
a radical change in the substance, whether, in a word, these two bodies were
really identical. Schunck's experiments proved that they were, and consequently

that this beautiful colouring-matfer, alizarni, existed as such in madder. If, how-
ever, we go one step further back and examine the fresh root of the Subia tinc-
torum (that is, as soon as it is dravra from the ground), we shall find no trace of alizarin
there. On slicing the root it is seen to be of a light carroty colour, and an almost

colourless liquid can be squeezed out of it; but this is entirely free from the
colouring-matters of madder. Let the roots, however, be kept, if only for a short
time, and then they will give abundant evidence of the presence of alizarin ; if

simply heated, alizarin may be volatilized from them. It appears, then, that the

whole of the tinctorial power of this root is developed after the death of the

--plant. Schunck explains this curious phenomenon as follows: In the cells of

the living plant there is a substance which he has isolated and has named
Rubian ; it is easily soluble in water and in alcohol : the solution is of a yellow
colour, and has an intensely bitter taste ; when dry it is a hard brown gum-like
body. It has none of the properties of a dye-stuff'; but if we take a solution of it,
add some sulphuric or hydrochloric acid to it, and boil, a yellow flocculent sub-

stance will slowly separate out, and on filtering it off" and washing it, it will be
found to have the tinctorial properties of madder, and to contain alizarin. In the
liquid filtered from it there is, with the acid added, an uncrystallizable sugar ; so

that in this way the original product in the root, the rubian, has apparently been
split up into alizarin and into sugar. To apply this reaction to what goes on in
the root after its removal from the ground, we have to find if any other substances
can take the place of the boiling dilute acid ; and Schunck has shown there exists in

the root itself a substance which is eminently fitted to produce this splitting-up of

the rubian. He obtained this decomposing agent from madder simply by digest-
ing it in cold water and adding alcohol to the liquid ; this threw down a reddish

flocculent substance ; and if only a small portion of this was added to an aqueous

solution of the rubian and allowed to stand for a few hoiu-s in a warm place, it

was found that the rubian was gone, and in place of it there was a thick tenacious
jelly ; this, treated with cold water, gave to it no colour, no bitter taste, but much
sugar. From the jelly remaining insoluble, alizarin could be extracted; in fact,
of all known substances this very one found in the madder itself is best suited for

eflecting this decomposition of the rubian.

   It has long been known to dyers that the amount of colouring-matter in madder

will increase on keeping it ; even for years it will go on improving in quality : and
an experiment of Schunck's shows that the ordinary madder, as used by the dyer,
has not all the rubian converted into colouring-matter ; for on taking a sample of
it and extracting with cold water, he got an acid solution devoid of dyeing proper-
ties; but on allowing this solution to stand some time it gelatinizetl, and then
possessed dyeing properties.

   It appears, then, that there must exist in the root two substances kept apart

during the life of the plant in some way of which we know nothing ; but as soon

as it dies they begin slowly to act on one another, developing thus the colouring-

matters in madder.

   Coincident with the appearance of Schunck's first paper was one by Debus on

the same subject. He looked upon alizarin as a true acid, and gave it the name of
lizaric acid ; but, as far as the composition of it was concerned, the percentage num-

bers he obtained agreed closely with those given by Schunck. One other investi-

gation concludes all that is important in the history of alizarin as obtained from

madder. This last investigation is of great interest ; it was by Julius Wolff and

Adolphe Strecker, and published in 1850. They confirm the results of others so far,

that there are in the madder-root two distinct colouring-substances, this important

one alizarin, and the other one purpurin. They prepare these colouring-matters

much in the same way that Schunck did, and very carefully purify and analyze

them. The formulse which they give for them differ, however, from Schunck's : for

alizarin they give the formula C^gtl^^Og, and for purpurin CjgHjjO,,; further, they

suggest that, by the process of fermentation, the former is converted into the latter
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

and they show that by oxidation they both yielded phthalic acid. Since the pub-

lication of this research, until the last year or two, this formula for alizarin has been

generally adopted by chemists ; and in most modern books we find it given as ex-

pressing the true composition of that body. It was not only the careful and

elaborate work which they devoted to the subject, but also the ingenious and

apparently well-foimded theory on the subject which carried conviction with it.

Laurent had shown, not many years before, that when naphthalin, that beautiful

and white crystalline substance obtained from coal-tar, was acted on by chlorine

and then treated vdth nitric acid, a body known as chloraaphthalic acid, and having

the composition CooHjoCljOg, was obtained; and on comparing this formula with the

one they had obtained for alizarin, Wolff and Strecker at once concluded that it

really was alizarin, only containing two atoms of chlorine in place of two of

hydrogen ; make this replacement, an operation generally easily performed, and

from naphthalin they had prepared alizarin. Further, this relationship between

chlornaphthalic acid and alizarin is borne out in many ways : it, like alizarin, has the

power of combining with different basic substances, has a yellow colour, is insolu-

ble in water, melts at about the same temperature, is volatile, and when acted on

by alkalies gives a strongly coloured solution. Taking, then, all these facts into con-

sideration, can we wonder that these chemists feel convinced that they have esta-

blished the composition of alizarin, and have shown the source from which it is

to be obtained artificially ? Apparently but one very simple step remains to crown

their work with success, that of replacing the chlorine by hydrogen. Melsenshad

only shortly before shown how this substitution could easily be made in the case of

chloracetic acid, by acting on it with potassium amalgam ; and Kolbe had used the
battery for the same purpos? : both these processes, and doubtless all others that the

authors can think of, are tried upon the chlornaphthalic acid ; but chlornaphthalic
acid it remains, and they are obliged to confess they are unable to make this sub-

stitution ; stiU they are strong in the belief that it is to be done and will be done,
and conclude the account of their researches by pointing out the great technical

advantage will be the getting alizarin from a worthless substance such as naphthalin.

One cannot help even now sympathizing with these chemists in their not being able

to confirm what they had really the strongest evidence for believing must prove to

Webe a great discovery.  now know, however, that had they succeeded in effect-

ing this svibstitution, or had they in any other way obtained this chlornaphthalic
acid without the chlorine, if I may so speak of it, which since their time has been

done by Martins and Griess, alizarin would not have been obtained ; but a body

having a remarkable parallelism in properties to it would have been. This body, like

alizarin, is of a yellowish colour, but slightly soluble in water, easily in alcohol and

in ether, is volatile, and on oxidation yields the same products ; it is, in fact, an

Weanalogous body but belonging to another group.  also now know that the formula

firoposed by Wolff and Strecker, and so long in use, is not the correct one. But

 ittle more remains to be added with regard to the history of alizarin, as gathered

mro the study of the natural substance. Schiitzeuberger and Paraf suggested
58 REPORT--1873.

doubling Wolff and Strecker's formula for alizarin ; and Bolley suggested the formula

CjjHjg 0,., which, owing to the uneven number of hydrogen atoms, was soon rejected.
If we compare our present knowledge of alizarin with what it was when these re-

searches on the natural product were completed, it is as light compared with

darkness ; and we may well ask, whence has come this influx of knowledge ? The
answer, I hope to show you, is undoubtedly that it has come from the careful and
accm-ate study of abstract chemistry. I know of no history in the whole of
chemistry which more strikingly illustrates how the prosecution of abstract science

lays the foundation for great practical improvements than the history of alizarin

does.

  My object now is, then, to show you, as shortly as I can, how by indirect means

the composition of alizarin was discovered, how it has been built up artificially,
and how it is superseding for manufacturing-pui"poses the long- used natural

product.

   To trace this historj' from its source we must go back to 1785, when an apothe-
cary of the name of Hofmann obtained the calcium salt of an acid called quinic acid
from Cinchona- bark. This acid is now known to be of common occurrence in plants;

it exists in the bilberry and in coffee, in holly-, ivy-, oak-, elm-, and ash-leaves,

and probably many other leaves. Liebig also prepared the calcium salt, and was

the iirst to give a complete analysis of it ; the formula he gave for it was Cjj H^^ O,^.
I5aup, on repeating Liebig's experiments, arrived at a somewhat different conclu-
sion, and gave the formula C,, il^o ^*io- ^^ 1835, at Liebig's suggestion to determine
which formula was correct, Alexander Wosla-ensky, from St. Petersburg, then a
student at Giessen, imdertook the further investigation of this subject, and esta-

blished the formula 0,^11,4 0,2, the one in fact now in use. In the course of this

investigation, which he carried further than merely settling the percentage composi-

tion of this acid, he describes what to us now is of most interest, a new substance
having peculiar and very marked properties. He says that when a salt of quinic

acid is burnt at a gentle heat he gets aqueous vapour, the vapour of formic acid,
and a deposit of golden needles, which are easily sublimed. Afterwards he describes

how this same golden substance may be obtained from any salt of quinic acid by

heating it with manganic dioxide and dilute sulphuric acid ; it then distils over,

condensing in golden-yellow needles on the sides of the receiver, and may be
rendered pure by resublimation. The composition of this body he finds to be
C3 IIj O, and namts it quinoyl, a name strongly objected to by Berzelius, as
conveying a wrong impression of the nature of the body ; he proposed in place of it
the name quinone, by which it is still known. Far as this body would seem to be

renx)ved from alizaiin, yet it is the study of its properties which led to the arti-

ficial production of alizarin.

   Some years afterwards Wcihler also examined the decomposition of quinic acid
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

he prepares again this quinone, and follows exactly the process described by
Woski-ensky : he states that, with regard to the properties of this remarkable body,
he has nothing particular to add ; however, he proposes a different formula for it,
and discovers and describes other bodies allied to it ; among these is hydroquinone,
Cg Hg O^. Laurent afterwards shows that the formula proposed by Wohler is incon-
sistent with his and Gerhardt's views, and by experiment confirms the former
formida for this bodj'. Although many other chemists devoted much attention to
this substance, still its real constitution and relation to other compounds re-
mained long unknown. Thus Wohler, Laurent, Hofmann, Stiideler, and Hesse all
had worked at it; and much experimental knowledge with regard to it had been
acquired. One important point iu its history was, first, the discovery of chloranil
by Erdniann in 1841, and then Hofmann showing that, by heating quinone with
potassic chlorate and hydrochloric acid, chloranil could "be obtained from it
that, in fact, chloranil was quinone in which all the hydrogen had been replaced
by chlorine. Perhaps the most general impression among chemists was, that
in constitution it was a kind of aldehyde ; certainly its definite place among
chemical compounds was not knowTi. Kekul(5 suggests a rational formula for it
but it is to Carl Graebe that we owe oiu' knowledge of its true constitution. In
1868 he published a remarkable and very able paper on the quinone group of com-
pounds, and then first brought forward the view that quinone was a substitution-
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                   59

derivative of the hydrocarbon benzol (CjUg). On comparing the composition of

these two bodies, it is seen that the quinone contains two atoms of oxygen more
and two atoms of hydrogen less than benzol ; and Graebe, from the study of the
decomposition of quinone and from the compounds it forms, suggested that the two

atoms of oxygen form in themselves a group which is divalent, and thus replace
the two atoms of hydrogen ; this supposition he very forcibly advocates, and shows
its simple and satisfactory application to all the then known reactions of this body.
This suggestion really proved to be the key, not only to the explanation of the
natural constitution of quinone and its derivatives, but to much important discovery

besides.

   At this time quinone seemed to stand alone ; no other similarly constituted body

was known to exist : but what strikingly confirms the correctness of Graebe's views,

and indicates their great value, is that immediately he is able to apply his lately

gained knowledge, and to show how really other analogous bodies, other quinones
in fact, already exist. He studied with great care this quinone series of com-

--pounds and the relation they bore to one another the relation the hydrocarbon

benzol bore to its oxidized "derivative quinone, and its relation to the chlorine
substitution-products derivable from it. At once this seems to have led Graebe

--to the conclusion that another such series already existed ready formed, and that

its members were well known to chenusts that, in fact, Daphthalin(C,(, H^) was the
parent hydrocarbon, and that the chloroxyuaphthalin chloride (C,oH^ Cl^O^) and

the perchloroxyuaphthalin chloride (CioCljO^) were really chlorine substitution-
compounds of the quinone of this series, corresponding to the bichloroquinone and

to chloranil--that the chloroxynaphthalic acid, CioH^ 01 (HO) O^, and the per-
chloroxynaphthalic acid, Ok, CI, (HO) O^, all comjDoimds previously discovered by

--Laurent, were really bodies belonging to this series and, further, that the sup-

posed isomer of alizarin discovered by Martins and Griess was really related to this
last compound, having the composition CioH5(HO)02. Further, he was able to
confirm this by obtaining the quinone itself of this series, the body having the
formula Ci,,Hg(02)", containing also two atoms less of hydrogen and two atoms
more of oxygen than the hydrocarbon naphthalin ; and to this body he gave the
characteristic name of naphthoquinone. The chlorine compounds just named are,
then, chloruaphthoquinones or chloroxynaphthoquinones, and correspond to the
former chloroquinoues ; and Martius and Griess's compound will be an oxynaphtho-
quiuone : many other compounds of this series are also known. Another step confir-
matory of this existence of a series of quinones was made by Graebe and Bergmann :
 as the chloranil could be found by treating phenol with potassic chlorate and hydro-
 chloric acid, and quinone derived from it, they showed that in the next higher series
 to the phenol series, viz. with cresol, the same reaction held good ; and by treat-

ing it in the same way, they obtained a di- and a trichlorotoluquinone, 0,

C,, I (O.j", which in physical properties very closely resembled the corresponding

compounds in the lower series : other compounds have also been prepared.
   In the next step we have the application which connects these series of disco-

veries with alizarin. FoDowing the clue of a certain analogy which they believed

to exist between the chloranilic acid i^a^hkiO) ) ^^^ ^^^ chloroxynaphthalic

acid (c,o H^ 01 '[iK ) , which they had proved to be quinone compounds and alizarin,

believing that a certain similarity of properties indicated a certain similarity of consti-
tution, Graebe and Liebermann were led to suppose that alizarin must also be a deri-

vative from a quinone, and have the formida (o^ H^ J^^'^. j . This theoiy they were

able afterwards to prove. The first thing was to find the hydrocarbon from which

the quinone might be derived. This was done by taking alizarin itself and heating
Ait with a very large excess of zinc powder in a long tube, closed at one end.
                                                                                pro-

duct distilled over, and condensed in the cool part of the tube. On collecting it and
purifying it by recrystallization, they found they had not a new substance, but a
hydrocarbon discovered as long ago as 1832 by Dumas and Laurent, and obtained
by them from tar. They had given it the formula C^Hj^; and as apparently it
thus contained once and a half as many atoms of carbon and hydrogen as naph-
thalin did, they named it Paranaphthalin. Afterwards Laurent changed its name

to Anthracene, by which it is still known. Fritzsche, in 1857, probably obtained the
same body, but gave it the formula OnHj^. Anderson also met with it in his re-
searches, established its composition, and formed some derivatives from it. Limprich
in 1866 showed it could be formed synthetically by heating benzol chloride (C^H^Cl)

with water; and Berthelot has since proved that it is formed by the action of heat

on many hydrocarbons. This first step was then complete and most satisfactory :

from alizarin they had obtained its hydrocarbon ; and this hydrocarbon was a body
already known, and with such marked properties that it was easy to identify it.

But would the next requirement be fulfilled ? would it, like benzol and naphthalin,

yield a quinone P  The experiment had not to be tried for when they found that
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

anthracene was the hydrocarbon formed, they recognized in a body already known

the quinone derivable from it. It had been prepared by Laurent by the action

of nitric  acid on anthracene,  and called  by him Anthracenuse                                                                                                            and the same
                                                                                                                                                                        ;

substance was also discovered by Anderson, and called by him Oxanthracene. The

composition of this body was proved by Anderson and Laurent to be 0,^ H^ 0^, and

thus bears the same relation to its "hydrocarbon anthracene that quinone and

naphthaquinone do to their hydrocarbons. Graebe gave to it the systematic name of

Anthraquinone.

  We have, then, now three hydrocarbons (CgHg, Ck,!!^, and Ci^H,,,) differing by

C4 Hj, and all forming starting-points for these different quinone series. Anthra-

quinone, acted upon by chlorine, gave substitution-products such as might have

been foretold. It is an exceedingly stable compound, not acted upon even by

fusion with potassic hydrate. Bromine does not act upon it in the cold ; but at

100° it forms a bibromanthraquinone. Other bromine compounds have also been

formed.

Now, if the analogies which have guided them so far still hold good, they would

seem to have the means of forming alizarin artificially. Their theory is that it is

C^dioxyanthraquinone (  Ilg !'tt'({n  )  , and if so, judging from what is known to take

place with other quinone derivatives, should be formed from this dibromanthra-
quinone on boiling it with potash or soda and then acidulating the solution. They

try the experiment, and describe how, contrary at first to their expectation, on boil-

ing dibromanthraquinone with potash no change occurred ; but afterwards, on
using stronger potash and a higher temperature, they had the satisfaction of seeing

the liquid little by little become of a violet colour. This shows the formation of

alizarin. Afterwards, on acidifying this solution, the alizarin separated out in

yellowish flocks. On volatilizing it they get it in crystals like those obtained

from madder; on oxidizing it with nitric acid, they get phthalic acid; and

on precipitating it with the ordinary mordants or other metallic solutions, they

get compounds exactly comparable to those from the natural product. Every trial

confirms their success ; so, by following purely theoretical considerations, they have

been led to the discovery of the means of artificially forming this important organic

Acolouring-matter.  special interest must always attach itself to this discovery

for it is the first instance in which a natural organic colouring-matter has been built

up by artificial means. Now the chemist can compete with nature in its produc-

tion. Although the first, it is a safe prediction that it will not long be the only

one. Which colouring-matter will follow next it is impossible to say ; but, sooner

or later, that most interesting one, scientifically and practically, indigo, will have to

yield to the scientific chemist the history of its production.

   Returning for a moment to the percentage composition of alizarin, now that we

portant colouring-matter in madder, purpurin, which so pertinaciously follows ali-

zarin, is in constitution very nearly allied to it, and is also an anthracene derivative.

    Scientifically, then, the artificial production of this natural product was complete
but the practical question, Can it he made in the laboratory cheaper than it can he
obtained from the root ? had yet to be dealt with. The raw material, the anthracene,
a by-product in the manufacture of coal-gas, had as yet only been obtained as a
chemical curiosity ; it had no market value ; its cost would depend on the labour
of separating it from the tar and the amount obtainable. But with regard to the
bromine necessary to form the bibromanthraquinone it was different ; the use of
such an expensive reagent would preclude the process becoming a manufacturing
one. But could no cheaper reagent be used in place of the bromine, and thus crown
this discovery by utilizing it as a manufacturing process ? It was our countryman

Mr. Perkin who first showed how this could be done, and has since proved the very

practical and important nature of his discovery by carrying it out on the manufac-
turing scale. The nature of Perkin's discovery was the forming, in place of a
bibromanthraquinone, a disulphoanthraquinone ; in a word, he used sulphuric acid in

place of bromine, obtaining thus a sulpho-acid in place of a bromine substitution-
compound. The property of these sulpho-acids, containing the monovalent group

H SO3, which is the equivalent to the atom of bromine, is that on being boiled with

an alkali they are decomposed, and a con-esponding alkaline salt formed. Thus the
change from the anthraquiuone to the alizarin was effected by boiling it with sul-
phuric acid. At a high temperature it dissolves, becoming a sulpho-acid,

HCi4 Hj < SO3 ; and then the further changes follow, as they did with the bromine

           (HSO.,

compound. The sulpho-acid boiled with potash is decomposed, and a potash salt
of alizarin and potassic sulphite are formed ; acid then precipitates the alizarin

as a bright yellow substance.

While Perkin was carrying on these researches in this country, Caro, Graebe, and

Liebermann were carrying on somewhat similar ones in Germany ; and in both

countries have the scientific experiments developed into manufacturing industries.

it is not often that purely scientific research so rapidly culminates in great practical

undertakings. Already has the artificial become a most formidable opponent to the
natural product ; and in this struggle, already begun, there can be no doubt which
will come off victorious.

In the manufactory is rigidly carried out the exact process I have already

described to you. In tar there is about one per cent, of anthracene ; this, in a

crude impure state, is obtained from it by the tar-distiller and sent by him to
the colour-works. Here it is purified by pressure, by dissolving from it many of
its impurities, and, lastly, by volatilizing it. Then comes the conversion of it into
the anthraquinone by oxidizing agents, nitric or chromic acid being used, then the
formation of the sulpho-compound by heating it with sulphuric acid to a tempera-
ture of about 260° C. The excess of acid present is then neutralized by the addi-
tion of lime, and the insoluble calcic sulphate is filtered off. To the filtered liquid

sodic carbonate is added, and thus the calcic salt of the sulpho-acid is changed into

                                         (0,)"                                                            This is afterwards heated to about 180° 0. with

                                                                                                       (

caustic soda,' thus decomposing the sulpho-acid and forming the soda salt of
alizarin and the sodic sulphite. The alizarin salt so formed remains in solution,

giving to the liquid a beautiful violet colour. From this solution sulphuric acid

precipitates the alizarin as an orange-yellow substance. It is allowed to settle in
large tanks, and then is run, in the form of a yellowish mud, which contains either

10 or 15 per cent, of dry alizarin, into barrels, and is in this form sent to the

print-works, and used much in the same way as the original ground madder
was used.

This alizarin mud, as I have called it, containing but 10 per cent, of dry alizarin,
--63 REPORT 1873.

is equal in dyeing-power to about 8 times its weight of the best madder, and is the

pure substance required for the dj'eing, in place of a complicated mixture containing

certain constituents which have a positively injurious effect on the colours produced.

The scientilic knowledge and energy which Mr. Perkin has brought to bear on

the manufacture of this colouring-matter seem already to have worked wonders.

The demand and supply     for artificial  alizarin                 are  increasing  at a most rapid rate
                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

and yet the manufacture of it seems hardly to have commenced. The value of

madder has much decreased ; and in fact, j udging by what occurred in the year of

revolution and commercial depression (1848), when the price of madder fell for a

time to a point at which it was considered it would no longer remunerate the

growers to produce it, that point has now been again reached, but certainly from

very different reasons. Last year * artificial alizarin equal in value toabout one

fourth of the madder imported into England was manufactured in this country.

This year the amount vtIII be much larger.
   Thus is growing up a great industry, which, far and wide, must exercise most

important effects. Old and cumbrous processes must give way to better, cheaper,
newer ones ; and, lastly, thousands of acres of land in many different parts of the

world wiU be relieved from the necessity of growing madder, and be ready to
receive some new crop. In this sense may the theoretical chemist be said even to

have increased the boundaries of the globe.

                          By Henry E. Armstrong, Ph.D., F.C.S.

AVhereas in the fatty series of organic compounds two classes of bodies of the

form Il'(^CN) are known, viz. the sulphocyanates and the so-called mustard-oils

or isosulphocyanates, in the aromaric series the compounds of the latter class alone

have been obtained. Thus all attempts to prepare plienylic sulphocyanate, for

example, by distilling a salt of benzenesulphonic acid with potassic sulphocyanate

have been unsuccessful. It appeared possible that the desired compound, altiiough

formed in the first instance, was produced at a temperature so high that it at once

underwent decomposition, and that better results might be hoped for from the

employment of sulpho-salts more easily acted upon tlian the benzenesulphonates.

A dry" mixture of the potassic salt of alpha-naphthalenesulphonic acid and potassic

sulphocyanate was therefore submitted to distillation; and a semisolid product

was thus obtained, which could be purified bj' recrystallization from a solution of

carbonic disulphide in alcohol. On analysis numbers were obtained which show

salt of beta-naphthelenesulphonic acid and potassic sulphocyanate behaved similarly

most metals that are capable of being precipitated by substitution may be obtained

in a black condition. The allied metals platinum, palladium, and iridium are

generally, if not always, black when thus prepared ; and bismuth and antimony form

black fringes, and little else.                    Similar  fringes are also formed by gold                                                                                                                       but 'it also

yields green, yellow, or lilac metal according to circumstances. Copper when first

deposited on zinc, whether from a weak or a                    strong solution,  is black                                                                                                                         but  in  the

latter case it becomes chocolate-coloured as it advances, or red if tlie action be

more rapid. Lead in like manner is always deposited black in the first instance,

though the growing crystals soon become of the well-known dull grey. Silver

and thallium appear as little bushes of black metal on the decomposing plate, if

the solution be very weak, otherwise they gi-ow of their proper coloui-. Zinc and

cadmium give a black coating, quickly passing into dark grey, when their weak

--solutions are decomposed by magnesium. The general result may be stated

thus : If a piece of metal be immersed in the solution of another metal which it

can displace, the latter metal immediately makes its appearance at myriads of

points in a condition that does not reflect light ; but as the most favourably

cii'cumstanced crystals grow they acquire the optical properties of the massive

metal, the period at which the change takes place depending partly on the nature

of the metal, and partly on the rapidity of its growth.

   In the production of the black deposit of the copper-zinc couple lately employed
by the author and Mr. Tribe to break up various compound bodies, there are several

stages that may be noted. At first an outgrowth of copper forms on the zinc

then while this action is still proceeding the couple itself acts upon the water or
the sulphate of zinc in solution, the metallic zinc being oxidized, and hydrogen
gas or black zinc being formed against the copper branches. This deposit" of zinc
was originally observed by Dr. Russell. The arrangement of the particles between
the two metals in connexion is supposed to be somewhat thus :

Cu ZnSO, ZnSO, H,0 H,0 Zn,
                        I I |||

which by the conjoint polar and chemical force becomes

64 REPORT-- 1873.

   If there is still copper sulphate in the solution, this deposited zinc may in its turn

become coated with copper ; but if it remain exposed to water it is sure to become
oxidized. The black deposit often assumes a brownish colour when this is the
case. The copper on which zinc has been deposited gives a brassy streak when
rubbed in a mortar ; but the presence of oxides tend to prevent the sticking
together of the detached pieces of metal, and thus the formation of a streak on
pressure. If, however, the oxide be removed by acetic acid, the clean ramifications
of metal, whether black or otherwise, conglomerate of their own accord in a re-
markable way, and little pressure is I'equired to obtain a yellowish metallic streak
while, if hydrochloric acid be used, the zinc itself also dissolves with effervescence,
and the conglomerating pieces of metal when rubbed give a coppery streak.

     On the Spectra of certain Boric and Phosphoric Acid Blowpipe Beads.
                                   By Charles Hoknee.

   This memoir is intended to show the importance of studying coloured phosphoric
and boric acid beads with the spectroscope, and that much valuable knowledge
may be derived from a careful observation of the various spectra, since certain
constituents in complex minerals may be often recognized in the same bead. The
author then explains how in phosphoric acid beads didymiuni, uranium, cobalt,
chromium, &c. may be detected in fractional quantities bj"^ their characteristic
absorption-bands and lines in the presence of other substances like iron, nickel, &c.,
which give no such positive spectra.

   The author also furnishes new tests for tungsten, molybdenum, and cadmium,
by which the two former more especially may be determined in infinitesimal

quantities of at least O'OOOl of a grain by means of their remarkable absorption-
spectra. To produce these results the author adopts the somewhat novel method
of fusing the substance along with boric acid simultaneously, at a very gentle heat,
until the bead is tolerably clear. Tungsten, molybdenum, vanadium, and titanium
oxides all yield brown beads when cold, nickel reddish purple, and cadmium a
bright yellow by reflected light.

   The subjoined Table gives the positions of the bands and lines according to Mr.
Sorby's scale and notation.

carbamide to form acids which are homologous with oxaluric acid. Thus, by
heating a mixture of succinic anhydride and urea in the proportion of their mole-
cular weights to 130° C, the succino-carbaminic acid is produced, as expressed

On Artificial Magnetite. By John Spillee, F.C.S.

   The object of this communication was to point out an error in the statement of
a chemical reaction occurring in several standard works of reference, and, in the

second place, to indicate the formation of cry.^tallized magnetic oxide of iron
(magnetite) in the ordinary process of manufacturing aniline from nitrobenzol by

the reducing action of metallic iron.

   Reference was made to Reimann's ' Aniline and its Derivatives,' and to Wagner's
' Chemical Technology,' where the action of iron upon nitrobenzol in the presence
of acid (B^champ's process) is stated to give ferric oxide or a " hydrated oxide
of iron." The author pointed to the fact that the ordinary residual product in this
operation was blade, and could be so far purified by washing and elutriation from

the excess of iron usually remaining in admixture as to give a fine black pigment,
which appeared under the microscope as minute octahedra, and was strongly
magnetic. Chemical analysis showed this to consist almost entirely of magnetic
oxide of iron, with such impurities as were inherent to the process or previously

existed in the cast iron. The physical properties of this form of oxide were
fiu"ther described, and its analogy to the native varieties of magnetic ore (Cornish
and Dannemora) shown by the followinog analyJsis of the substance dried at
110° C.:-

            On a form of Gas-generator. By C. J. Woodward, B.Sc.

   What are required in a gas-generator are a ready means of bringing the acid

into contact with the zinc, marble, &-c., and, what is of even greater importance, a
ready means of removing it when the supply of gas is no longer wanted. The
generator devised by Dobcreiner is theoretically perfect ; but, owing to slight leakage,
it win not remain in action for any length of time.

  Two forms of generator were described. The first consists of a stoneware vessel

somewhat similar to a Woulfe's bottle. To one of the tubulures is fastened a glass

cylinder containing the zinc, marble, &c. ; to the other tubulure is attached a tube

through which a plug of wood passes loosely. To bring the apparatus into action
             TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                              67

the wooden plunger is depressed, when, from displacement, the acid rises and is

thus brought into contact with the zinc. When the plug is down the supply of gas is

self-regulating, Just as in the apparatus of Dobereiner. The other form of generator,
and the one which the author generally uses, is made from a wide-mouthed bottle
containing acid. Into the mouth of this bottle fits a glass cylinder containing the

materials for generating the gas. At the shoidder of the bottle is a hole admitting
a small india-rubber tube, on which is placed a pinch-tap.

    Supposing the apparatus is wanted in action, the pinch-tap is opened and air
forced into the bottle by means of the mouth. The pressure of air forces acid up
the cylinder, when immediately the gas is given off. The apparatus is put out of
action in a moment by opening the pinch-tap, when the confined air escapes and
the acid falls. Instead of using the mouth to compress the air, a small india-

rubber ball may be used.

Neiu Derivatives from Codeine and Morpliine. By CR. A. Weight, D.Sc.

        Lond., Lecturer on Chemistry in St. Mary's Hospital, London.

    Since the last Meeting of the Association the following further residts have been
obtained, partly in conjunction with ISIr. E. L. Mayer, of Glasgow.

   Some of the polymerides of morphine corresponding to the di-, tri-, and tetra-
codeine described in last year's paper are obtainable by the action of sulphuric acid
diluted with its own bulk of water on morphine at 100°. Although dicodeine is

readily obtainable from codeine in this way, dimorphine does not appear to result in
any appreciable quantity ; trimorphine and tetramorphine, on the other hand, are

readily producible, the physical properties of these two bases and their derivatives

corresponding exactly with those of tricodeine and tetracodeine respectively. The
derivatives of the four series of polymerides may be thus characterized :

Mono-series (non-polymerized).  Bases crystalline                                                                   salts crystalline.
                                                                                                                 ;

Z)j-series (polymerized). Bases amorphous and soluble in ether ; salts crystalline,

TV-t-series (polymerized). Bases amorphous and soluble in ether; salts amorphous.

2e</-a-serie3 (polymerized). Bases amorphous and insoluble in ether; salts

amorplious.

   On account of their physical properties, the bases hitherto provisionally termed

"apomoi-phine," " deoxycodeine," and " deoxymorphine " are viewed as being

derivatives of (hypothetical) dimorphine or of dicodeine respectively.

   Trimorphine, when administered subcutaneously to cats, produces excitement

and salivation, with slight hypnotesia, but no vomiting ; tetramorphine, on the
other hand, is a most energetic emetic, its action being (so far as cats are con-
cerned) much more marked than even that of " apomorphine."

   Trimorphine is acted on by hydrochloric acid, producing a chlorinated base ; in
this respect trimorphine is not analogous to tricodeine, which only loses the
elements of water by this treatment ; thus,

Tricodeine   C3 =6H.,0+(C3-6H2 0),
Trimorphine
             M3 -f- 2H01 = 2PI, O + (M3 + 2HC1 - 2H, 0).

   The occurrence of this reaction proves that the base termed trimorphine (and
hence also by analogy tricodeine) is actually the treble polymeride of morphine

a conclusion hitherto only deduced from the physical properties of the series of
polymerides.

   Tetramorphine, like tetracodeine, is not acted on by hydrochloric acid.
   The so-called " sulphomorphide " of Arppe and of Laurent and Gerhardt,
supposed by the latter to be a kind of amide, is found to be nothing but the
sulphate of tetramorphine ; its formation is accompanied by the production of
minute quantities of "apomorphine."
   The action of hydrochloric acid on morphine appears to give rise, first, to

--chlorinated bases derived from non-polymerized morphine a mixture of sub-
--stances of compositions (M-l-IICl), (M-(-H01-H, O), and (M-(-2HGl-2H2 O)

being produced, and secondly, by the further alteration of these just formed

substances, to "apomorphine " and a chlorinated tetra-base (M^+2HC1).

The action of hydrochloric acid on codeine is in some respects analogous to, in

others   different  from, that  on  morphine                                         the first products formed                    are    derived

mononiorphine is G^^ Hg^ N^ 0^, and not C,, H^ NOg);

In just the same way the first action of hydrobromic acid on codeine is found to

+give rise to (C IlBr), (C-|-2HBr-- 2H,0) or " bromocodide " being subsequently

produced.

   The further action of hydrochloric acid on " chlorocodide " has been shown by

Matthiessen and the author to consist in the elimination of methyl as chloride, and

the abstraction of the elements of water, forming " apomorphine," the reaction

taking place at 140-150° in sealed tubes. When the action is allowed to take place

at 100°  however, it follows a slightly different                                       course                            methyl  chloride is formed
                                                                                                                       ;

and water is eliminated, but the resulting substance is not " apomorphine," but a

bodv which may be regarded as standing intermediate between dimorphine and

"apomorphine" (tetrapodimorphine); its physical characters are those of a di-

derivative, and it much resembles apomoiiihine in all respects save composition and

physiological action ; the recrystallized pure hydrochloride gave numbers leading

to the formula (Mg-- 2H2 O), "apomorphine" being (Mj - 4H2O) ; and hence the name

cliapodimm-pkine is given to this substance. Simultaneously with diapodimorphine,

abase isomeric therewith, but belonging to the teti-a-series, is produced ; this, being

indicated by the formula (51^--411; O), may be termed tetrapoMvamorpUne.

   The alteration in the physiological action (on cats) of the nioi-phine polymerides
produced by successive abstraction of the elements of water is well exemplified by
the following Table. The last-mentioned base, odapotetramorphinc, is obtained as
the final product of the joint action of concentrated zinc chloride and hydrochloric
acid on morphine; its formauon is preceded by that of "apomoi-phine," the base

(M+HCl-- 1L,0), and a tetra-base (M.j-|-IICl-4H2 0), the one or the other being

formed according to the temperature employed and otlier circumstances.

   It hence appears that the emetic action (on cats) of di-derivatives becomes much

increased as the abstraction of the elements of water goes on, whilst the oppo-

site holds in the case of the tetra-derivatives. Isonierides in different series may

or may not have the same kind of physiological action ; thus diapodimorphine

and its isomeride tetrapotetramoi-phine are not far apart in their effects, whilst

--tetrapodimorphine and its isomeride octapotetramorphiue are very dissimilar just

as morphine, trimorphine, and tetramoi-phine, or codeine, dicodeine, tricodeine, and

tetracodeine are different in physiological action.

   The differences in chemical reactions -between the four series of polymerides and

their derivatives are as well marked as are their physiological properties; thus
when either " apomorphine," diapomorphine, or " deoxymorphine " (all of which
are di-derivatives) is dissolved in caustic potash solution, a liquid is obtained which
rapidly absorbs oxygen from the air : on acidifying this liquid with hydrochloric
acid and agitating with ether, a substance is dissolved out which communicates to
the ether a magniticeut pm-ple tint. This colouring-matter is possessed of the some-
what remarkable property of giving solutions of very different colours and shades
with various solvents, the same quantity being dissolved to the same bulk in each
case : thus alkalies dissolve it, forming a bright green liquid ; water containing

ammoniacal salts, a beautiful blue ; whilst alcohol, chloroform, bisulphide of carbon,

ether, and benzene dissolve it, forming liquids of shades varying ti-om violet-blue
to red -purple, but differing in each case. The puie substance is indicated by the
formula C^g H31 N.^ O.. It is insoluble in acids, and forms an indigo-blue powder

exhibiting traces of crystallization.

   Only di-derivatives are capable of giving rise to this colouring-matter ; mono-,

tri-, and tetra-derivatives of morphine and codeine do not yield a trace of it, provided
the substances used are perfectly free fi-om all admixture of di-derivatives.

   Again, the action of heat (15()°-180°) on the hydrochlorides of monomorphine de-
rivatives causes them to decompose ; and on distilling with potash the resulting

substance, a mixture of methylamine and jn/ridine is obtained. On subjecting tetra-

morphine derivatives to the same treatment, methi/lamitie only is produced ; whilst
" apomoi-phine " (the only di-derivative available in sufficient quantity for the ex-

permient) yields no volatile base at all by this treatment.

It would hence seem probable that the relations of the nitrogen to the other ele-

ments present are different in the different series of polymerides. Experiments are

contemplated with a view to estimating the different amounts of " Intrinsic Chemi-

cal Energy " present in equal weights of isonierides in the different series.    Vide

                                                                               (

The derivatives of morphine and codeine (upwards of forty in number) that have

been obtained during the last few years may, with only one or two inconsiderable excep-

tions, be all regarded as derived from one or other of the polymerides, M, M^, M3, Mj,

or C, Cj, C3, Ci, by addition or subtraction of hydrogen, addition of the elements of
hydrochloric (hydrobromic or hydriodic) acid, and elimination of the elements of
water ; all consequently are expressible by the general formulae

More than half the life of an octogenarian separates us from the birthday of the
British Association in Yorkshire ; and few of those who then helped to inaugurate

a new scientific power can be here to-day to estimate the work which it accom-
plished, and judge of the plans which it proposes to follow in future. Would that
we might still have with us the wise leading of Ilarcourt, and the intrepid advo-

cacy of Sedgwick, names dear to Geology and always to be honom'ed in York-

shire !

   The natural sciences in general, and Geology in particular, have derived from the

British Association some at least of the advantages so boldly claimed at its origin :
some impediments have been removed from their path society looks with approba-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

tion on their efforts ; their progress is hailed among national triumphs, though
achieved for the most part b}' voluntary labour ; and the results of their discoveries

are written in the prosperous annals of our native industry.

In most cases scientific truth is established before that practical application is

possible which constitutes a commercial revolution and is welcomed with applause

by the community. What a change has happened within forty, nay, twenty years,

in the ironworks of this country ! But long before the foundations of furnaces were

laid at Middlesborough, the ferruginous bands in the Yorkshire cliffs had been

often explored by geologists, and waited only for the railway to yield millions of tons
of ore. The occurrence of good ironstone in the Liassic strata of England is a source

of profit as far to the south as Oxfordshire ; Northamptonshire yields it in abundance

at the base of the Oolites,                     and Lincolnshire  above             them                             while  on the  Yorkshire
                                                                                                                  ;

coast, in addition, we have smaller beds in the midst of the Oolites, through nearly

the whole range, associated with poor and thin coal.
   To determine the extent of the British coal-fields, and the probable duration of

the treasures which they yield, and to discover, if possible, other fields quite un-
dreamed of by practical colliers, are problems which geology has been invited to
solve ; and much progress has been made in these important inquiries by private re-
search and the aid of a public Commission. The questions most interesting to the

--community the extent to which known coal-fields spread beneath superior strata,
--and the situation of other fields having no outcrop to the surface can often be an-

swered on purely geological grounds, within not very wide limits of probability.

If, for example, we ask how far to the eastward the known coal-strata may extend

under the Vale of York, a reasonable answer is furnished by Mr. HuU and the Govern-

ment Commission. The whole great coal deposit, extending from Bradford to

Nottingham, passes under the Magnesian Limestone, and may be found for at least

a few miles in breadth vsdthin attainable depths. It passes under a part of the

Vale of York, probably south of the city. But before attempting to give a practical

value to this opinion, it may be well to remember that, fully tried, the experiment

would be too costly for individual enterprise, while if successful it would benefit

more than a county, and that not only a large outlay must be provided for it, but

arrangements made for persevering through several years in the face of many diffi-

culties and perhaps eventual disappointment. Still, sooner or later, the trial must

be made                                    and  geology must direct the operation.
                                        ;

Considerations of this kind invest with more than momentary interest the great
     TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                                                    -7!

undertaking to which Mr. Godwin-Austen called attention in his address to the

Geological Section at Brighton. Not to dig gypsum, not to open a new supply of

salt, not to discover coal in Sussex, bnt to find out what is below the ^^^ealden,

and thus contribute to solve a great practical problem for Loudon and all the south

of England, have geologists undertaken the deep boring near Hastings. What is
below the Wealdeu? Do the oolitic rocks continue beneath it with their usual

characters and thickness ? or do they suffer that remarkable diminution which is

observed in their eastward declination through the midland counties ? Do they
occur at all there .'' may they lie only in separate patches amidst older rocks ? may

these older rocks, contiuued from Belgium, appear at once or at no great depth

below the Wealden, and bring with them, if not coal, some sure knowledge of the

way in which the great subterranean anticlinal passes from the Rhineland through

Belgium to Somerset, South Wales, and Ireland ? Such an experiment must not

be allowed to come to a premature end.

   Turning, however, from these topics, which involve industrial interests, to other

lines of geological research, we remark how firmly since 18.31 the great facts of rock-

stratification, succession of life, earth-movement, and changes of oceanic areas have

--heen established and reduced to laws laws, indeed, of phenomena at present, but

gradually acquiring the character of laws of causation.

  Among the important discoA^eries by which our Icuowledge of the earth's

structure and history has been greatly enlarged within forty years, place must be

given to the results of the labours of Sedgwick and Mm-chisou, who established the

Gambro-Silurian systems, and thus penetrated into ancient time-relies very far

toward the shadowy limit of palreontological research. Stimulated by this success,

the early strata of the globe have been explored with unremitting industry in

every corner of the earth ; and thus the classification and the nomenclature which
were suggested in Wales and Cumberland are found to be applicable in Russia and

India, America and Australia, so as to serve as a basis for the general scale of

geological time, founded on organic remains of the successive ages.

This great principle, the gift of William Smith, is also employed with success in

a fuller study of the deposits which stand among the latest in our history and

involve a vast variety of phenomena, touching a long succession of life on the land,

changes of depth in the sea, and alterations of climate. Among these evidences of

physical revolution, which, if modern as geological events, are very ancient if

--estimated in centuries, the earliest monuments of man find place not buildings,

not inhabited caves or dwellings in dry earth-pits, not pottery or fabricated metal,

but mere stones shaped in rude fashion to constitute apparently the one tool and

one weapon with which, according to Prestwich, and Evans, and Lubbock, the

poor inhabitant of northern climes had to sustain and defend his life.

  Nothing in my day has had such a decided influence on the public mind in

favour of geological research, nothing has so clearly brought out the purpose and

scope of om' science, as these two great lines of inquiry, one directed to the

beginning, the other to the end of the accessible scale of earthly time ; for thus has

it been made clear that our purpose can be nothing less than to discover the history

of the land, sea, and air, and the long sequence of life, and to marshal the results

--in a settled chronology not, indeed, a scale of years to be measured by the

rotations or revolutions of planets, but a series of ages slowly succeeding one

another through an immensity of time.

There is no question of the truth of this history. The facts observed are found

in variable combinations from time to time, and the interpretations of these facts

are  modified in different directions                                                                                                                                                 but the facts are all natural phenomena, and
                                                                                                                                                                                   ;
--the interpretations are all derived from real laws of those phenomena some'

certified by mathematical and mechanical research, others based on chemical

discovery, others due to the scalpel of the anatomist, or the microscopic scrutiny of

the botanist. The grandest of early geological phenomena have their representa-

tives, however feeble, in the changes which are now happening around us ; the

forms of ancient life most surprising by their magnitude or singular adaptations can

be explained by analogous though often rare and abnormal productions of to-day.

Biology is the contemporary index of Palaeontology, just as the events of the nine-

teenth century furnish explanations of the course of human history in the older times.
72 REPORT--1873.

To forget, in referring to this subject, the name of our great and veteran leader,

Sir Charles Lyell, would be difficult for any who have profited by the perusal of

his masterly works, is impossible for those who, like me, have been witnesses of that

life-long zeal and energy which carried him to explore distant regions and make

fi-iends for English Geology in every quarter of the globe.

Keeping our attention on Pleistocene Geology, we may remark that the famous

cavern of Kirkdale, with the equall}^ celebrated rock den of bears and hyseuas at

Torquay, receive no small help toward clearing up the history of mammalia in

Britain from the explorations now going on in the limestone cliffs not far from this

place of meeting. In Kirkdale Cave no trace of human ai't appeared ; Kent's Hole
has given proofs of the presence of man from the earliest period characterized by

the remains of the gi-eat bear; and both there and in the Victoria Cave near

Settle, at much later periods, domestic occupation is fully established.

It will be readily conceded that for gathering good information regarding the

aborigines of our land the British Association has wisely appropriated some por-

tion of its funds probably we shall agree in thinking that the additional data
                                                                                ;

which may be expected are worthy of further expenditm'e and the employment of
valuable labour. And this leads me to remark how real is the obligation of this

Association to some of its members who have directed these researches, and how

large a debt of gratitude is due to one in particular, who, not content with tm-uing

every day his intelligent eyes on the remarkable phenomena disclosed by excava-

tion in the Torquay caverns, has with his own hands cleared and washed thousands

of bones and teeth, studied, labelled, and arranged them, and year by year has de-

lighted this Section with careful narratives of what he and Mr. Vivian, following

the steps of MacEnery, have surely observed and recorded. Labom- of this kind

the Association cannot purchase ; nor would the generous spirit of my friend con-

mysent to such a treaty. I may, however, use the privilege of  temporary office,

and suggest to j'ou to consider whether the time is not come for the friends of the

Association, and especially the members of this Section, to unite in a general effort,

and present to Mr. Pengelly a substantial proof that they highly appreciate his disin-

terested labours in their service, and the ample store of new knowledge which he

has had so large a shai-e in producing.

   During the long course of geological time the climates of the earth have changed.

In many i-egions evidence of such change is furnished by the forms of contemporary

life. Wai-m climates have had tlieir influence on the land, and favoured the gi'owth

of abundant vegetations as far north as within the arctic circle ; the sea has

nourished reef-making corals in Northern Europe during Palaeozoic and Mesozoic

ages ; crocodiles and turtles were swimming roimd the coasts of Britain, among

islands clothed with Zamia and haunted by marsupial quadrupeds. How have we

lost this primpeval warmth ? Does the earth contribute less heat from its interior

stores ? does the atmosphere obstruct more of the solar rays or permit more free

radiation from the land and sea ? has the sun lost through immensity of time a

sensible portion of his beneficent influence ? or, finally, is it only a question of the

elevation of mountains, the course of oceanic currents, and the distribution of land

and sea?

The problems thus suggested are not of easy solution, though in each branch of

the subject some real progress is made. The globe is slowly changing its dimen-

sions by cooling ; thus inequalities and movements of magnitude have arisen and

are still in progress on its surface : the effect of internal pressure, when not resulting

in mass-movement, is expressed in the molecular action of heat which Mallet applies

to the theory of volcanoes. The sun has no recuperative auxiliary known to
Thomson for replacing his decaying radiation ; the earth, under his influence, as
was shown by Herschel and Adhemar, is subject to periods of greater and less

warmth, alternatelj' in the two hemispheres and generally over the whole surface

and finally, as Hopkins has shown, by change of local physical conditions the

climate of northern zones might be greatly cooled in some regions and greatly
warmed in others.

   One is almost frozen to silence in presence of the vast sheets of ice which some of

my fr'ends (followers of Agassiz) believe themselves to have traced over the moun-

tains and A ales of a great part of the United Kingdom, as well as over the kindred
             TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                     73

regions of Scandinavia. One shudders at the thought of the innumerable icebergs

with their loads of rock, which floated in the once deeper North Sea, and above the

hills of the three Ridings of Yorkshire, and lifted countless blocks of Silurian stone

from lower levels, to rest on the precipitous limestones round the sources of the

Kibble.

Those who, with Professor Ramsay, adopt the glacial hypothesis in its full extent,

and are familiar with the descent of ice in Alpine valleys where it grinds and

polishes the hardest rocks and winds like a slow river round projecting cliffs, are

easily conducted to the further thought that such valleys have been excavated by

such ice-rubbers, and that even great lakes on the course of the rivers have been dug

out by ancient glaciers which once extended far beyond their actual limits. That

they did so extend is in several instances well ascertained and proved ; that they did
in the manner suggested plough out the valleys and lakes is a proposition which

cannot be accepted until we possess more knowledge than has yet been attained

regarding the resistance offered by ice to a crushing force, its tensile strength, the

measure of its resistance to shearing, and other data required for a just estimate of

the problem. At present it would appear that, under a column of its own substance

1000 ft. high, ice would not retain its solidity ; if so, it could not propagate a greater
pressure in any direction. This question of the excavating effect of glaciers is

distinctly a mechanical problem, reqmring a knowledge of certain data ; and till

these are supplied, calculations and conjectures are equally vain.

  A distingmshing feature of modern geology is the great development of the doc-

trine that the eartli contains in its burial-vaults, in chronological order, fonns of

life characteristic of the several successive periods when stratified rocks were depo-

sited in the sea. This idea has been so thoroughly worked upon in all countries,

that we are warranted to believe in something like one universal order of appear-

ance in time, not only of large groups but even of many genera and species. The

Trilobitic ages, the Ammonitic, Megalosaurian, and Palseotherian periods are familiar

to every geologist. What closed the career of the several races of plants and ani-

mals on the land and in the sea, is a question easily answered for particular parts of

the earth's surface by reference to " physical change ; " for this is a main cause of the

presence or absence, and in general of the unequal distribution of life. But what

brought the succession of different races in something like a constant order, not in

one tract only, but, one may say, generally in oceanic areas over a large portion of

the globe ?

   Life unfolds itself, in every living thing, from an obscure, often undistinguishable

--cell germ, in which resides a potential of both physical and organic change

change which, whether continual or interrupted, gradual or critical, culminates in

the production of similar germs, capable under favourable conditions of assuming

the energy of life.

  How true to their prototj'pes are all the forms with which we are familiar, how

correctly they follow the family pattern for centuries, and even thousands of years,

is known to all students of ancient art and explorers of ancient catacombs. But

much more than this is known. Very small differences separate the elephant of
India from the mammoth of Yorkshire, the Waldheimia of the Australian shore

from the Tcrebratula of the Cotswold oolite, the dragonfly of our rivers from the

Lihelhda of the Lias, and even the Rhyndionellce and Lingulce of the modern sea
from the old species which swarm in the Palseozoic rocks.

But concurrently with this apparent perpetuity of similar forms and ways of life,

another general idea comes into notice. No two plants are more than alike ; no two

men have more than the family resemblance ; the offspring is not in all respects an
Aexact copy of the parent.
                                 general reference to some earlier type, accompanied

by special diversity in every case (" descent with modification "), is recognized in

the case of every living being.

Similitude, not identity, is the effect of natural agencies in the continuation of

life-forms, the small differences from identity being due to limited physical con-

ditions, in harmony with the general law that organic structures are adapted to the

exigencies of being. Moreover the structures are adaptable to new conditions ; if

the conditions change, the structures change also, but  not suddenly                                                      the  plant or

under critical inversions. These adaptations, so necessary to tlie preservation of a

race, are they restricted within narrow limits ? or is it possible that in the course of

long-endiu'ing time, step by step and grain by grain, one form of life can be

changed and has been changed to another, and adapted to fulfil quite different

functions ? Is it thus that the innumerable forms of plants and animals have been

" developed " in the course of ages upon ages from a few original types ?

This question of development might be safely left to the prudent researches of

Physiology and Anatomy, were it not the case that Palseontology furnishes a vast

range of evidence on the real succession in time of organic structures, which on the

whole indicate more and more variety and adaptation, and in certain aspects a

growing advance in the energies of life. Thus at first only invertebrate animals

appear in the catalogues of the inhabitants of tlie sea ; then fishes are added, and

reptiles and the higher vertebrata succeed ; man comes at last, to contemplate and

in some degree to govern the whole.

The various hyjjothetical threads by which many good naturalists hoped to

unite the countless facts of biological change into an harmonious system have

culminated in Darwinism, which takes for its basis the facts already stated, and

proposes to explain the analogies of organic structures by reference to a common

origin, and their differences to small, mostly congenital, modifications which are

integrated in particular directions by external physical conditions, involving a

" struggle for existence." Geology is interested in the question of development, and

in the particular exposition of it by the great naturalist whose name it bears, be-

cause it alone po.ssesses the history of the development in time, and it is to incon-

ceivably long periods of time, and to the accumulated effect of small but almost

infinitely numerous changes in certain directions, that the full effect of the transfor-

mations is attributed.

For us, therefore, at present it is to collect with fidelity the evidence which our

researches must certainly yield, to trace the relation of forms to time generally and

physical conditions locally, to determine the life-periods of species, genera, and

families in different regions, to consider the cases of temporary interruption and

occasional recurrence of races, and how far by uniting the results obtained in dif-

ferent regions the alleged " imperfection of the geological record " can be remedied.

The share which the British Association has talcen in this great work of actually

reconstructing the broken forms of ancient life, of repeopliug tlie old land and older

sea, of mentally reviving, one may almost say, the long-forgotten past, is considerable,

Weand might with ad\'antage be increased.  ask, and wisely, from time to time, for

the combined labour of naturalists and geologists in the preparation of reports on

particular classes or families of fossil plants and animals, their true structure and

affinities, and their distribution in geological time and geographical space. Some

examples of this useful work will, I hope, be presented to this Meeting. Thus have
we obtained the aid of Agassiz and Owen, and have welcomed the labours of Forbes,

and Morris and Lycett, and Huxley, of Dawkins and Egerton, of Davidson, Duncan,

and Wright, of Williamson and Oarruthers and Woodward, and many other emi-

nent persons, whose valuable results have for the most part appeared in other volumes

Among these volumes let me in a special manner recall to your attention the price-

less gift to Geology which is annually offered by the Palseontographical Society, a
gift which might become even richer than it is, if the literary and scientific part of
our community were fortunate enough to know what a perpetual treasure they

might possess in return for a small annual tribute. The excellent example set and

the good work recorded in the Memoirs of the Society referred to have not been

Wewithout influence on foreign men of science.     shall soon have such Memoirs

from France and Italy, Switzerland and Germany, America and Australia ; and I

trust the effect of such generous rivalry will be to maintain and increase the

spirit of learned research and of original observation which it is our privilege and

our duty to foster, to stimulate, and to combine.

On all the matters, indeed, which have now been brought to your thoughts the

one duty of geologists is to collect more and more accurate information ; the one

fault to be avoided is the supposition that our work is in any department complete.

We should speak modestly of what has been done ; for we have completed nothing,

         Additional Remains of Pleistocene Mammals in Yorlcshire.

The bones referred to were discovered in the recent working of an old marl-pit

at Bielbecks near North Cliff, whence mammalian remains have been previously

obtained. The first discovery was recorded by the Rev. W. V. Vernon Harcom-t in

the ' Philosophical Magazine ' for 1829. More remains were deposited in the York

Museum when the excavations were renewed about twenty years later ; and this last

summer many more have been exhumed. These latter were exhibited. The com-

belong to river or marsh species. The bones were mostly found in one spot, but

some of the mammoth at a little distance away. It is noteworthy that no Hippo-

potamus bones have yet been found. The age is probably later Pleistocene, though

there is little to indicate it in the fossils ; but it is in all probability postglacial,

being a tranquil deposit ; and there are glacial beds at nearly the same level in the

neighboui-hood, so that if it had been preglacial it would probably have been earned
away.

On some Evidence of Olacial Action in Tropical India in Palceozoic (or the
      oldest Mesozoic) times. By W. T. Blanfoed, F.G.S., C.M.Z.S.

The author in the year 1856, when describing some rocks in Orissa, suggested

that a very peculiar association of large boulders with fine shales might have been
Adue to the transport of the boulders by gi'ound-ice.
                                                       similar deposit has been

traced throughout a very large area in Bengal and the Central Provinces in India,

and is always characteristic of the base of the Talchir group, the lowest member of

the great series of plant-bearing rocks, for which the name of Gondwana series has

recently been suggested. Quite recently Dr. Oldham, the Superintendent of the

Geological Survey of India, has found scored and striated blocks in this Talchir

boulder bed, the surface upon which the bed rests being also polished and

gi-ooved.

   The theory (of boulders, sand, and clay slipping downwards on low slopes during
the gradual elevation of laud above the sea) put forward by Mr. Mallet to accoimt
for similar phenomena, and which was considered by General Portlock in 1857 to

explain the peculiar association of large boulders and tine silt, does not appear

satisfactory ; for, amongst other difficulties, it leaves the fact of many of the boulders
having come from a distance entirely unexplained. Mr. Blanford, whilst aware

of the apparent incongruity involved in invoking the aid of ice to explain pheno-

mena occurring in a tropical coimti-y, can suggest no other explanation of the

facts.

   The exact age of the Talchir is still doubtful ; but there can be but little doubt of

their being pre-Triassic.

     On Archaediscus Karreri, a New Type of Carboniferous Foraminifera.
                         By Henry B. Bkadt, F.L.S., F.G.S.

   This paper contained a detailed description of certain minute imsymmetrical
lenticular fossils Jy of an inch in diameter and ^^ of an inch in thickness, from the

"Main Limestone " of the Lower Carboniferous Limestoue series of Lanarkshire,
and the Mountain Limestone of Great Orme's Head, Caernarvonshire.

   They were shown to be Foraminifera closely allied to A'^M«?H^^//««, and differing
primarily from that genus in beiug composed of a non-septate tube coiled on itself in

varying directions, and thickened on the exterior (especially near the centre of the
disk) by the deposit of shell-substance, instead of the symmetrical, regularly coiled
spiral line of chambers characteristic of the more highly developed type. The par-
ticulars entered into concerning the minute structure of the type would be unin-
telligible without the figures by which the paper was illustrated *.

   The generic term ArcJicedisciis was proposed for the new type.

   On such of the Industries of Bradford as relate to its Geologic-al Position.
                                      By John Brigg.

   After briefly pointing out the geological position of Bradford, the author pro-
ceeded to notice the excellent quality of the building-materials of the district,
drawing special attention to the rough sandstone rocks which are technically

termed Grits. The extreme durability of this stone was pointed out, also the
appropriateness of its use for engine-beds, floors of dock-gates, and the base-
ments of large buildings. Its power of withstaudiug the injurious effects of
constant exposure to water was also mentioned. The laminated rocks which
underlie some parts of the town of liradford were next dwelt upon, and their suit-
ability for roofing-slates, flags, and paving-stones, as well as for ordinary building
stones, was described.

  The New Town Hall, and particularly the Statues of the Kings, which form its

chief architectural ornament, were instanced as examples of the finest sandstone
that can be used for public buildings. The author then spoke of the Calliard or
Gannister beds in the Grit and Coal series, pointing out their position as being the

same, and containing: the same fossils as the fireclay which is the usual seat of
the coal. The use of Calliard for producing the fine sand used in the moulding of
iron and brass was explained, as also the pi'ocess by which the stone is reduced.

   The manufacture of firebricks, sanitary tubes, and domestic pottery from tlie
fireclay of the Halifax coal-seam was explained, as also the process by which
sulphate of iron is made from the pyrites contained in the same seam. The author
proceeded at some length to describe the position and quality of the irregular
seams of coal which are found beneath the Rough Rock, and also pointed out the
peculiarities of the two seams of coal called the Halifax Hard and Soft beds,
which are usually classed as the lowest of the true Coal-measures. The line of
their outcrop was also pointed out.

   The paper also contained a short description of the ancient bloomeries in the

disti'ict, and concluded with a notice of^ the seams of iron and coal found at

Bowling and Low Moor.

      On the Discovery of a Species of Starfish in Devonian Beds of South
                            Devon. By A. Champernowne.

   The only record hitherto, so far as I know, of the occurrence of Starfish in
British Devonian rocks, is that given by Mr. Etheridge in his list of Devonian
Fossils (Q. J. Geol. Soc. vol. xxiii. p. 619), viz. Protaster, sp., and ralceastcr, sp.,
from the Pilton beds of North Devon ; therefore the discovery of a species in South-
Devon rocks may not be without interest.

   The localit}' which jdelded the few specimens in question is ft small quarry at
Inglebourne House near Ilarbertonford (about three miles S.S.W. of Totnes), in
slates with one or two thin gritty layers, on one of which, forming part of the floor
of the quarry, were the impressions.

   The dip is about S.E. (20° east of south magnetic) at 15°, crossed by cleavage
at a higher angle towards the south.

   Viewed in connexion with the Harbertonford limestone, and the slate-quarry at
Roster Bridge, the beds would appear to belong to the Upper South-Devon series.

   In the old quarries at Harbertonford the limestone and shale dip north at 10°,
the angle heightening to 25° close to the Vicarage ; and in the adjoining cutting
of the Kingsbridge road, the slates, rising to the south with undulations, are
apparently below the limestone. This woidd seem to produce the line of the lime-
stone to the north of the Ilarber at Woodcourt, and probably to the north of
Roster-Bridge slate-quarr}' (where iSpirifers and other fossils are numerous), and
hence to trough some slates in the neighbourhood of Inglebourne which contain
the Starfish *. At Roster-Bridge quarry the cleavage is the predominant feature,

the bedding being at variance with the S.S.E. dip shown on the map north of

Dolling, half a mile to the west.

   [The impression of the body-plates is unfortunately wanting in the specimens of

Starfish which were intrusted to my friend Mr. Lee ; but I venture to hope they
may be described by some more experienced palseontologist than myself, the object

of this paper being merely to record the fact of their occurrence, and to describe the

locality.]

      Note by Henry "Woodavard, F.B.S., on A. Champernowne's Paper.

  Two Devonian Starfishes have been notedf by Mr. Etheridge, F.R.S., in the

Devonian of North Devon, which he refers to the genera Protaster, sp., and Pales-
aster, sp., ft'cm Middle and Upper Devonian of Pilton J.

* I revisited the spot in company with Mr. J. E. Lee and Mr. Paige-Browne, of

Inglebourne House, and owner of the  quarry                                 and  this was  the view taken by tlie latter,
                                                                         ;

wlio considered the roofing-slates of Roster-Bridge quarry deeper in the series than

the slates around liis house, and the last nearly on the horizon of the limestone of
Harbertonford. Our search for Starfish, however, was fruitless.

Asterias asjjerula, A. sinnosissima, Helianthaster rhenamis) from the DeTonian of
Bundenbach bei Birkenfeld *.

   Prof. Morris informs me he has no knowledge of any other species from these

beds.

   Fifteen genera and fifty species of Starfishes have been recorded from the Silurian.
Of these various forms the Helianthaster rhenanus, Birkenfeld Devonian, and the
Lepidaster Grai/i, from the Wenlock Limestone, Dudley, offer the nearest analogy
with the fossil Starfish found by Mr. Champeruowue in South Devon. All three
forms belong to the family of the Sulasteria, or many-rayed sun stars.

   Bearing in mind that the Asteriadse were preceded in point of time, as also in
point of development by the Crinoidea, the discovery of so many additional forms
of Palajozoic Starfishes, shows us how far we are from the beginning of this

group in time.

  Only lately Dr. Hemy Hicks, F.G.S., has discovered a new Crinoid in the Lower

Cambrian Rocks of St. David's, carrying back the class to an extremely di.stant

point in palasozoic time.

       On (lie Oeology of part of Craven, By J. E. Daktns, M.A.

The type of millstone-grit prevalent in Derbyshire undergoes considerable

changes north of Bradfield ; the second grit becomes merely a basement-bed to

the Kough liock ; the third grit loses its massive character ; and other beds of
sandstone begin to show themselves in the shales overlying the Kinder-Scout

grit.

   In the valleys of the Colne and Calder there are four separate sandstones be-

tween tlie Rough Rock and the Kinder-Scout grit.

 --In the basin of the Aire the series consists in descending order : first, of the

Rough Rock, which maintains its usual marked character throughout ; secondly,
of a very variable basement-bed to the last, consisting, when well developed, of
valuable fiagstoues. These are extensively quarried at Nab, above Oxenhope Moor,

and also in an outlier at the Penistone quarries near Ilaworth. Below tbis bed
comes a series of A'ariable sandstones and shales. There may be in places as many
ag fifteen or sixteen distinct sandstones between the basement of the Rough Rock

and the Kinder-Scout grit.

But this set of beds may conveniently be divided into two by means of a conspi-

cuous grit, which is continuous with the third grit of Lancashire. This grit forms

Wethe bold escarpment of HaUan hiU and Earl crag.  may conveniently speak

of it as the middle grit. It generally has three grits between it and the base of

the Rough Rock ; and these fom- beds are presumably the four gi-its of the Calder

and Colne valleys.

 --The general run of the rocks in the basin of the Aire is as follows : The Rough

Rock runs in a nearly unbroken manner from the latitude of Penistone, and enters

the basin of the Aire above Oxenhope Moor : its basement flags form the Nab

Aescarpment.  large fault, crossing 1 hornton Moor in W.N.W. direction, throws

down the Coal-measures of Denholme on the north, fi'om beneath which the

Rough Rock rises to form Black and Brow moors. Another W.N.W. fault throws

the beds up again near CuUingworth, so that Harden Moor, between Bingley and

Keighley, consists of an outlier of Rough Rock, while various members of the

third grit series form the flanks of the hill. West of the river Worth a dip slope

of Rough Rock forms Keighley Moor ; but at Exley Head another W.N.W. fault

throws up the beds to the north, so that an outlier of Rough Rock forms the hiU

on which is situated Keighley Tarn. Going N.W. from the tam one passes suc-

cessively over the various members of the third grit series. The middle grit,

clearly marked by its massive character, rims down to the valley south of Hawk-

clift' cottage ; it ascends on the north side of the Aire, somewhat broken by faults,

and forms Brunthwaite and White crags, and the escarpment of Addingham Moor,

It is this rock which forms the Brimham rocks near Pateley Bridge. Below the

middle o;i'it there is no conspicuous rock south of the Aire ; but north of that river

several heds of sandstone appear, one of which becomes important further north

as the hard siliceous " homestone " grit with gaunister, which forms the top of

Great Whernside. The Kinder-Scout grit is brought in south of the Aire by a

W.N.W. fault containing galena. North of the Aire it rises up regularly from

beneath tlie overlying beds at Kildwick. Near Cononley the beds are repeated

by a N.E. fault throwing down on the N.W. The Kinder-Scout grit is imme-

diately underlain by a variable set of sandstones with shale partings, usually called

Yoredale grit. Below these are found, at Skipton, shales and limestones. The

strike of the beds hitherto described is N.E. and S. W. ; but about the latitude of

Skipton the strike changes to E. and W., with a dip of 20° to the south along

Skipton Moor. The whole coimtry, in fact, between the latitudes of Skipton and

Grassington has been much disturbed and thrown into a series of east and west

rolls. Thus a strong anticlinal ranges up the Skibeden valley from Skipton to

ABolton Ab'oeJ^ mass of moimtain-limestone, forming Haw Park, is thus brought

up in the Skibeden valley between two ranges of miUstone-giit hills, viz. the

Skipton Moor and Embsay Moor. The mountain-limestone here is a dark thin-

bedded limestone. It is much quarried for road material at Haw Bank and at

Thornton. The beds are much contorted along the south side of Skibeden. Two

limestones are seen on the north side above the mountain-limestone. On the south

side of the Skibeden anticlinal the Kinder-Scout grit strikes E. and W. along Skip-

ton and Draughton moors, and descends to the Wharfe north of Addingham. The

southerly dip carries it up the slope of Langbar Moor, its base running below

Beamsley Beacon                                                                                      it  then plunges  down  northward to Kex beck, where the beds
                                                                                                  ;

bend up again and rise northward to Hazlewood Moor and Bolton Park : here the

beds bend over northward and recross the Wharfe below Laund House. South of

this, as far as Bolton Abbey, limestones and shales of the Yoredale series are seen

along the river. These beds are cut off opposite Bolton Abbey by a N.E. fault

bringing in the upper beds. The Yoredale grits run along the slopes of Skipton

Moor to Fairfield Hall, and east of the Wharfe are found about Beamsley and

AStoniths. They have not been everywhere identified north of Skibeden.                                                                  set

of bold crags marks the escai-pment of the Kinder-Scout grit along Halton and

Embsay moors, Rilstone, Burusall, and Thorpe fells. Beneath the western escarp-

ment of the Kinder-Scout grit the Yoredale gi-it is found, forming at intervals

promontories on the side of the fell. It has not been traced further east than the

northern extremity of BurnsaU Fell. The Kinder-Scout grits lie in the shape of

a synclinal trough dipping east, and thus occupy the whole extent of Burnsall Fell

and Barden and Embsay moors. On the east of the Wharfe these grits rise up in

a sort of broken dome, with a quaquaversal dip to form the summit of Barden Fell

marked by the crags of Simon's Seat, near which some pot-holes indicate the pre-

sence of limestone at no great depth. In Howgill and in Fell Plantation the beds

are dipping steeply to the N.W. into the valley ; but north of SkjTeholme beck

they dip steeply to the S.E., underlain by shales, from beneath which massive

white scar limestone rises regularly with a similar strike, as far as the Ordnance

Station, 1350 feet above sea-level, where the beds are cut off by the Craven fault.

The position of this fault is also shown by the abrupt termination of Fancarl crags,

and by distm-bance of beds at Thruskell Well, Hebden, and by disturbed beds on

the banks of Wharfe near Lyth House ; thence the fault runs b}' Skirethorns to

the cliffs which mark the line of the fault from Malham to Settle. East of the
river Dibb we have north of the Craven fault massive white limestone dipping

north at 19°, closely overlain by the grits of Grimwith Fell, the upper part of the

limestone containing a band of mixed shales, limestones, and calcai'eous sandstones.

Between the Dibb and Grassington the miUstone-grits seem to be separated from

the limestone by a great thickness of shales, with but poor limestone bands. At

Grassington the limestones swell out ; and, with the exception of a band of hard

sandstones (the Dirt-Pot grits), there is solid limestone from the grits of Gras-

sington Moor to the Wharfe. Northwards the limestone gradually breaks up, and

finally takes on the Yoredale type.

     Observation on the Rate at which Stalarjmite is heing accumulated in the

     Inglehorough Cave*. By W. Boyd Davvkins, M.A., F.R.8., F.G.S.

   The only attempt to measure with accuracy the rate of the accumulation of
stalagmite in caverns in this country, is that made by Mr. James Farrer in the
lugliTborough Cave, in the years 1839 and 1845, and published by Professor
Phillips in ' The Rivers, Mountains, and Sea Coast of Yorkshire ' (second edition,
18-55, pp. 34, 35). The stalagmite, called " the Jockey Cap," rises from a crystal-
line pavement to a height of about 2^ feet, and is the result of the deposit of

carbonate of lime.
   For the sake of ensuring accuracy, three holes were bored at the base of the

stalagmite, and three gauges of brass wire (gilt) inserted, to mark the points where
the measurements were taken.

                               By the Rev. John Guxn.

   This paper was supplementary to one read at the Brighton Meeting upon the
same subject, in which the author dwelt principally on the evidence of repeated
successive elevations and depressions in the Anglo-Belgian basin since the Car-

boniferous epoch ; and he thence inferred that similar depressions may be ex-
pected to have occurred during it, when the coal may have been deposited in

troughs and hollows, and have escaped subsequent denudations. The author dwelt
upon the westerly upheaval of the beds .wliich has brought the whole of the
Cretaceous rocks to the surface and has exposed the Kimmeridge clay near Lynn
and Hunstanton; he therefore thought that the Coal-measures, if present at all, of
which he felt very sanguine, would be reached at a less depth there than else-

where.

   The author would not propose to press the boring in the west of Norfolk in
preference to that proposed by Mr. Godwin-Austen in the south of Essex ; but
when the latter is completed, he will have no doubt of raising the necessary
funds if the site which he proposes be approved by geologists.

On the Occurrence of Faults in the Permian ItocJcs of the loiver ^wrtion of the
    Vale of the Eden, Cumberland. By Professor Haekness, F.B.S., F.G.S.

The Permian rocks occupying the vale of the Eden have their southern limit

at Kirkb}' Stephen in Westmoreland ; thence they extend, over the more level

country through which the river flows, to near Carlisle. .

   The strilce of these Permian rocks from Kirkby Stephen to near Armathwaite is

--nearly N.N.W. and S.S.E. They consist of : first and lowest, light red-coloured

sandstones very false-bedded (Penrith sandstones) ; second, red clays having

--gypsum frequently associated with them and in one instance, near Hilton in

Westmoi-eland, light drab shales with plant-remains (marl slate), and a limestone

at their base ; the third member of the series is composed of fine-grained dark

red sandstones, very regularly bedded with red claj's intercalated in them.

Had these Permian rocks followed their ordinary strike along the whole of

the vale of the Eden, the gypsiferous red clays would have crossed the river a

short distance above Armathwaite liridge. They do not, however, occur in the

bed of the river near this spot, although rocks are hero abundantly exposed

the last spot where they have been recognized with their ordinary strike being

at Cross Ilouse near Ruckcroft, about three miles south of Armathwaite.

The area where they might have been expected to occur in the neighbour-

hood of Annathwaite, is occupied b_v the underlying Penrith sandstones ; and these

spread themselves eastwards into the parish of Ainstable, into a district in which

the Upper Permian rocks (the Corby sandstones) would have been seen had the

range of these rocks been such as is exhibited in the vale of the Eden south of

Armathwaite.

The great development of the Penrith sandstones at Armathwaite and Ain-

stable, and the absence here of the gypsiferous clays and overlying Corby sand-

stones, the author regards as resulting from a fault having a nearly S. W. and N.E.

course, with an upthrow on the N.W. side.

Still further down the Eden there are seen, in consequence of a cutting re-

cently made at Eden Brows on the Carlisle and Settle Railway, exposing the rocks,

strata of purplish white sandstones having interbedded gi-ey shales. These sand-

stones and shales appertain to the Carboniferous formation ; and their occurrence

here appears to result from another fault, which has also an upthrow on the N.W.

side. The position of these sandstones and shales in the Carboniferous series can-

not be well made out at Eden Brows. There are, however, exposures of Carboni-

ferous rocks (which seem to result from the influence of the same fault) a fdw miles

t« the west ; and these Carboniferous rocks belong to the lower portion of the group.

   Immediately north of Eden Brows the Permian rocks are again seen. As they

occur on the east side of the river, in Fishgard Wood, they consist of the higher

members (the Corby sandstones) ; and on tlie west side of the Eden the gypsiferous
 red clays have been extensively worked. Another fault gives rise to the presence

of these strata, which have a strike nearly E. and W. This latter fault, having a

direction nearly parallel to the strike of the strata, can be well seen in Shalk beck
near Curthwaite Station, on the Maryport and Carlisle Eailway, where it exhibits
a downthrow on the north side.

On the Areniij and Llandeilo Bocks of St. David's. By Henry Hicks, F.G.S.

    The author mentioned that the object intended in the paper was to follow out
the succession of the rocks in the neighbourhood of St. David's, commenced in pre-

vious papers communicated at various times to the British Association. By the

present paper the section was completed to the top of the Llandeilo series.
    The author divided the Arenig group into an upper and lower series, and the

Llandeilo gi'oup also in the same manner, believing that in each case there was
suiBcient evidence to enable him to do so.

    The Loiver Arenig Series, it was stated, occur as black slates and flags, about
1000 feet in thickness, and exposed at the north end of Ramsey Island and at
 Whitesand Bay, resting conformably in the former place on Tremadoc rocks, but
separated from them in the latter by a fault. They are characterized by a large
number of species of dendroid Graptolites, as well as by numerous species of trilo-

bites entirely restricted to the series.

    The Uj}per Arenig Series occur <is fine-grained, soft, black shales, also about 1000
feet in thickness. They are found at the south end of Ramsey Island and at White-
 sand Bay, where they rest conformably on the Lower Arenig series, and again on
the north coast of Pembrokeshire, where they support the Lower Llandeilo rocks
 of Aberiddy Bay. The Graptohtes of this series are totally distinct from those
 found in the lower beds, as are also all the other fossils. Didymograptus hijidus,
gemintis, and affinis are characteristic of this zone.

    The Lmver Llandeilo Series, the lowest rocks recognized by Sir R. Murchison in
the typical Llandeilo district, and hence called by him Lower Llandeilo, occur at
 St. David's as black slates and hard grey flaggy sandstones with siliceous schist and
beds of felspathic ash at the lower part, and as dark slates and flags, with nume-
rous calcareous bands in the upper. They are about 1500 feet in thickness, and are
 chiefly found on the south coast of Aberiddy Bay, resting conformably on the upper
 Arenig rocks. The most characteristic fossils of these beds are I)idgniograptus
 Mu7-chisoni, Diiilograptus pistis, Asaphus tyrannus, Calymene camhrensis, and Illesmis

perovalis.

    The Upper Llandeilo Series occur as black slates and flags several thousand
 feet in thickness, forming several folds of strata in a direction north of Aberiddy
 Bay, at which place they rest conformably on the Lower Llandeilo series. The ty-
 pical fossils are Ogygia Buchii, Barrandia Cordayi, Calymene dnplicata, Chei)-ttrus

Sedgwickii, Trimwleus Jimlriatus, Ampyx nudics, and Lingula Bamsayi.

    The author doubted whether any other spot hitherto examined in Britain could
 show so continuous a section of these rocks ; still he believed that there was ample
 evidence to prove, from researches made in other parts of Wiiles and Shropshire,
that the succession here made out was in most of its important details capable of
being applied to many other districts.

 On some Graptolitesfrom the Upper Arenig Bods ofBamsey Island, St. David''s.
                       By John Hopkinson, F.G.S. , 'F.BM.S.

    At the Meeting of the British Association at Brighton last year the author had
announced the discovery of a considerable number of Graptolites in the Ai-euig
rocks of Ramsey Island and Whitesand Ba}', near St. David's, and had shown that
these rocks were more nearly allied by their Graptolites to the Quebec rocks of
Canada than to their British representatives, the Skiddaw slates of Cumberland and
the Arenig rocks of Shelve.

   Since then a new series of fossiliferous beds had been discovered on Ramsey
Island ; and the Graptolites collected in them had been intrusted to the author for
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                    83

determination. Owing to their fragmeutaiy condition the following species only

could be determined :

Didymogi-aptus afRnis, Nich,   Diplo^-aptus dentatus, Brong, sp.
                                   (=i). pristiniformis, Halt);
          bifidus, ILill.               mucronatus, Hall,
         geminiis, His. sp.
         patiilus, Hull.       Climacograptus sealaris,X/»m. sp.

   The evidence aftbrded by these species was considered to be decidedly iu favour
of the view that these new Eamsey-Island beds were of UppeT Arenig age, and
therefore higher than those previously known.

   Comparing the Graptolites of the Sldddaw slates of Cumberland and the Arenig
roclis of Shelve with those of the Lower and Upper Arenig rocks of Kamsey Island,
there appeared upon the whole to be a parallel succession of species in the Shelve
and Ramsey-Island rocks ; while the Skiddaw series seemed to be more nearly re-
lated to the upper than to the lower Ramsey- Island beds ; and it was inferred that
the Skiddaw slates, which have hitherto been considered our oldest graptolite-
bearing rocks, are of more recent age than the lowest graptolitiferous rocks of St.

David's.

   On tlie Occurrence of numerous Sjyecies of Graptolites in the Ludlow HocJcs

             of Shropshire. By John HopiciKsojsr, F.G.S., F.Ii.M.S.-

   Until recently only two species of Graptolites, 3Ionograptus (Graptolitkus) priodon

and M. culomts, were believed to occur in the Ludlow rocks of Shropshire. In 1868
Dr. Nicholson added to these a new species of Ptilof/rapivs, and mentioned the pre-

sence of an additional species of 3Ionograptvs. These had been collected by Ml".

Lightbody of Ludlow, who had also found a few other species in these rocks.

    In the course of an excursion of the Geologists' Association to the Silurian rocks
of Shropshire in July 1872, and during a subsequent visit which the author had
paid to Ludlow and its neighbourhood, several other species had been found, and
some information on the distribution of the species had been elicited.

   While, however, the number of species known to occur in the Ludlow rocks has
been greatly augmented by these researches, one or two forms, hitherto supposed
to be characteristic of one or the other division of these rocks, had not been found in
them. Not a single specimen of Monograpt'us priodon had been seen in the Ludlow

rocks, all that were found being from the "Wenlock shale ; and not a single Grap-

tolite had been detected in the Upper Ludlow rocks, although two species, M. co-
lonm and M. ^n-iodoii, had been stated to be of common occurrence in both the Lower
and Upper Ludlow. The Graptolites, with the exception of a species or two of the

Dendroidea, appeared to have died out for ever in the Aymestry limestone, in

which a few indeterminable fragments only have been found.

   The following species had been detemiined :

                              Hhahdojjhora,

Monogi'aptus bohemicus, Barr.  Monograptus incurvus, sp. nov.
         eapula, sp. nov.

          colonus, liarr.               Salweyi, sp. nov.

   These species were found to be restricted in their range in time, and to charac-
terize the same zones at distances wide apart. Some progress had been made to-
wards working out this interesting question ; but a more lengthened investigation
of the Lower Ludlow rocks in the Ludlow area was considered to be necessaiy

before any definite conclusion could be arrived at.

On the British Pidceozoic Arcadte. By J. Logan Lobley, F.O.S.

    In this paper the results of an examination of the described species of Lamelli-

brauchiata attributed to the familj' Ai'cadie, and occurring in British Palaeozoic
roclcs, were given.

   After proposin"; that the sinupallial genera which have hitherto been included
in Arcadoe should be removed from that family and constitute a separate group,
the author discussed the claims of the various generic distinctions which authors
had sought to establish, and thought the following genera might be admitted as
having representatives in the Palajozoic strata of the British Islands : Area (L.),
Cucullcea (Lam.), Macrodon (Lvcett), Nucula (Lam.), Cte)iodonta (Salter), Ch~

--cuUella (M°Coy), Glyptarca (Hicts), Palaiarca (Hall.) the species of ArcadiB which

had been assigned by various authors to Bi/ssoarca, Cbidophorus, Cypricarditls,
Cyrtodonta, Meyamhonia, Pallastra, Tdlinomya, Vanuxemia, &c. being given to one
or other of the before-mentioned genera.

   The following summary gives the number of species admitted in each genus, with

its stratigraphical range in the Palseozoic rocks :

On a Horn and Bones found in a Cuttinq in a Street in Maidenhead, BerJcs.
                              By T. Moffat, M.D., F.G.S.

   The horn and bones were found imbedded in flint gravel about six feet from the
surfece. They appeared to be much mineralized. There are cuts upon the horn,
apparently made when it was fresh and for the purpose of separating it from the
skull. The cuts seem to have been made with an edged metallic tool.

 On Geological Systems and Endemic Diseases. By T. Moffat, M.D., F.G.S.

   The author stated that the results given in this confirmed what he had stated
in his former papers, viz. that goitre and anaemia are endemic on the Carboniferous

system, while they are absent on Cheskire or New Red Sandstone. He wished it

to be understood, however, that the observations were made only in the district la
which he resided.
TBANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  85

   Refening to a suggestion made by ^h: Lebour, of the Geological Survey, in a
paper " Ou tlie Geological distribution of goitre in England and Wales," that the

cause of goitre "is the metallic impurities in the water," and a statement "that it

prevailed most where ferruginous water occurred," the author states that iron
medicinally administered produces beneficial effects, but when fen-uginous water is

taken daily it produces a low state of health, and in that way might predispose to
the formation of goitre ; but such water would not cause anremia. He observes

that it is very doubtful, however, if water containing iron is ever used as a potable
water or for culinary pui-poses, one grain per gallon rendering it unfit for making

an infusion of tea.

   In the neighbourhood in which he lives such water is avoided. In the per-
formance of his duties as Medical Officer of Health, he had chemically examined

ten public wells in his district ; and he did not detect a trace of iron in one of them,

from which he concludes that goitre, which is very prevalent in the locality, can-

not be caused by ferruginous water.
   As anfemia is a state of the system in which oxide of iron is deficient in the

blood, and as goitre appears at a time of life and under conditions of the system

when a maximum quantity of nutritious food is required, he concludes that where

there is a deficiency of iron and phosphates, or nutritive salts in the food, these

forms of disease will prevail.

   By chemical analysis he has shown that iron and the phosphates are deficient in

wheat grown upon the Carboniferous system compared with that grown upon the

New Red Sandstone. Soils, he observes, are formed by the disintegration of the rocks

or formations upon which they lie, and consequently they consist of the same in-
gredients. The colouring-matter of the Cheshire sandstone is oxide of iron ; and
the soil upon it is thoroughly impregnated with that oxide. The Carboniferous

SJ^stem is not impregnated with it ; oxide of iron is not so thoroughly diffused

throughout this system as it is in the New Red Sandstone ; so, compared with

the latter, there is a deficiency of iron in the soil upon the former.
   To the above rule he states there are, however, exceptions, as soils do not

alwaj's consist of the disintegrated rocks upon which they rest. In a district with
which he is well acquainted the geological formation is Millstone-grit, yet the soil

upon it is as highly coloured with oxide of iron as that upon New Red Sandstone

at no great distance from it. In this district goitre and anaemia are unknown.

He concludes that goitre and antemia do not occur in a district having a soil con-
taining a maximum quantity of oxide of iron and phosphates, no matter what the

system is upon which it rests.

On the Ainmonitic Sjyircd in reference to the power of Flotation attrihxUed to

   the Animal. By John Phillips, M.A., F.Ii.S., D.C.L. Oaon., LL.D.

    Cambr. and Dublin, Professor of Geology, Oxford.

   The author, while considering the subject in connexion with the recent Nmdihis
pomjjiHt(s and Spirrila and with many fossil genera, found a deficiency of data as
to the proportion of the supposed air-chambers to the whole volume of the shell
and the part of it occupied in life by the animal. To obtain such data he examined
the spiral structure by means of principal sections on the plane of volution, and
found that, omitting the earliest small volutions, the growth of the ammonite shell
was in manj' species uniform, so that the proportion oif the last chamber to the sum
of all the preceding ones was nearly uniform ; but among different species the
character of the spiral difi'ered. In one group the breadths of the volutions measured
on a radius vector increased in geometrical proportion ; in another the increase was
in arithmetical proportion ; between these two forms all ammonitic spirals appeared
to be contained. The author then showed how, in the former group, the power of
flotation, if it existed, would be uniform through life, but in the latter continually

increasing. In order to see the exact bearing of this on the question of flotation, it
would be necessary to determine some other points as to the thickness of shell and

number of septa.
   With respect to the further function attributed to these animals, that cf

sipliuncle, tliat sucli a power of adapting- the specific gravity of the shell must
have been very limited ; and he was disposed, on the whole, to believe that the
old Cephalopods, in rising and falling, trusted more to their strong arms than to
the filhno' and emptying of the pipe which connected the chambers. The subject
is under investigation.

On the Ammonitie Septa in relation to Geological Time. By John Phillips,
   M.A., F.B.S,, D.CL. Oxon., LL,D. Cambridge and Dublin, Professor of

     Geologg, Oxford.

    The author, viewing the Ammonitidje as a family extending in time from the
Devonian to the Cretaceous period, proposed to examine into the genealogy of the

proper genus called Ammonites. He showed that from a supposed ancestral origin

--in Goniatites, two lines of real or imaginary descent might be traced one through

 Ceratites of the Muschellvalk to the Cassianic ammonites, another through the

Arietes and other species of Lower Lias to the Upper Oolite and Cretaceous groups.
In neither case is the genealogy proved between the Carboniferous and later

families ; but in each case the change of septal outline (or " suture ") is from simple
Undulations to very complicated foliations. Such change, then, is only indicative of
 successive time as it is characteristic of successive physiological change. Instead of
 one development from Gonidtites, the most convenient form of hypothesis, at present,
 would be to assume separate systems of development, each limited in time to

 different periods, but following the same course of physiological change. The
 same order of change occurs in the embryonic, yomig, and old shell of each species.
 (The author hopes to make a further communication.)

 The Loess of Northern China, and its Relation to the Salt-basiiis of Central
                   Asia. B>j Bakon von Bighthopen, Ph.D. (Berlin).

    Northern China is covered with a yellow earth which resembles the Loess of
 the valley of the Rhine in all essential properties. It is fine-grained and fusible,
 yet so solid as to form vertical clifis and bluffs several hundred feet high, and dis-
 tinguished by the complete absence of planes of stratification as well as a marked
 tendency to vertical cleavage. It resembles loam in composition (its chief ingre-
 dients being an argillaceous and ferruginous basis which contains very fine sand
 and carbonate of lime in varying proportions), but differs from that earth by
 possessing a highly porous and tubular structure. The tubes, which are very thin
 and usually incrusted with a fine calcareous film, occupy in general a vertical posi-
 tion, and ramify like the roots of grass. They cause the Loess to absorb water
 like a sponge, and prevent the existence of any lakes on its surface, or the issuing
 of springs from the body of the formation, although these are copious where the
 earth rests on rocks or stratified soil. The Loess encloses bones of land-animals
 and an abimdance of well-preserved shells of terrestrial mollusca, but no marine
 or freshwater fossils. Calcareous concretions are always disseminated through it,
 and mostly arranged in well-defined layers, in which, as a rule, the longer axis of
 each nodule occupies a vertical position.

    The Loess is peculiar to Northern China, no trace of it occurring in the southern
 firovinces; it is observable on the side of Mongolia and Central Asia, just to the
  imit of the headwaters of those rivers which flow towards the sea, covering
 altogether an area of about 240,000 square miles. Within this area it spreads
 alike over low and high ground, from the level of the sea to altitudes of 8000 feet,
 its thickness varying from very little to upwards of 1500 feet. It smooths off" the
 irregularities of the surface, and, by connecting with each other the crests of
 distant mountain-ranges, created between them large trough -like basins with gently
 inclined slopes, the bottom of each'of which is made up of stratified earth which
  otherwise resembles Loess in appearance and is strongly impregnated with
.alkaline salts. The sides of each basin are furrowed by innumerable and infinitely
 ramified gullies, which frequently attain the depth of 1500 feet. With the exception
 of the great alluvial plain adjoining the lower Hwangho, human habitations and

agriculture are confined in Northern China to the Loess, millions of people living

in caves dug in that earth.
   As regards the mode of origin of the Loess of China, it can neither be a fresh-

veater deposit, which Pumpelly supposed it to be, nor a marine formation, which

--Kiugsmill attempted to make it not so much on account of the absence from it of

either freshwater or marine fossils and the want of stratification, as because lacus-
trine strata could not possibly be deposited on the crests of the highest mountain-
ranges and the most elevated portions of plateaux, while the theory of a marine
origin woidd force us to presuppose Eastern Asia to have been submerged
at least 8000 feet beneath the present sea-level in very recent time, an assumption
against which there exists a great deal of direct evidence. The author next
attempted to prove that the Loess is a subaerial deposit, and drew attention to
the close similarity in the character of the surface between the Loess-basins of
Northern China and the salt-basins of the steppes of Central Asia. From Pamir
and the Karakorom to the headwaters of the large rivers fiowing towards the seas
which surround Asia on the north-east and south-east, a vast extent of country
(exhibiting diflereuces of altitude as great as any which occur in Europe) is made
up of numerous basins without outward drainage, the surface of each of which slopes
gently down from the crests or declivities of the sm-roimding mountain-ranges
towards the lowest portion, which is filled with a salt lake or marsh. Each basin

exhibits now the surface of an accumulation of debris, which smooths off the
inequalities of the rocks below, but is unknown equalty as to composition,

structure, and thickness, because no portion below the smooth surface is exposed
to view. Everywhere the soil is impregnated with salts, and therefore allows only
of the growth of a steppe vegetation. Neither the salt lakes nor the steppe
deposits have originated (as has been suggested) in the former submergence of the
whole area beneath the sea, but are of subaerial origin. The products of decom-
position of the mountain-ranges which constitute the skeleton of Central Asia, not

being able to make their way to the sea, are deposited in the adjoining basins,
partly by rain-water, which washes them ofl" the rocks and distributes them equally
over the gentle slopes, and partly by winds which carry large amounts of them
away and, in the present time, frequently obscure for many days the atmosphere
by the ingredients they carry in suspension, depositing them finally as fine dust
over the surface. The substances which are thus mechanically distributed over
the soil by either agency are retained there by the vegetation, and cause, in the

course of centuries, the gradual raising of the surface ; while the soluble products of
decomposition are mainly collected in the central pool, where the evaporation of
the water causes the gradual concentration of the solution ; and at the same time

stratified soil, similar in composition to the soil of the steppes, is deposited. If now

in any one basin the rains, in consequence of slight climatal changes, cause a
greater increase in the quantity of water than is lost by evaporation, the basin will
gradually be filled and the water finally seek an outlet at the lowest place of the

margin. With the gradual deepening of the channel the basin will be di'ained, and

the affluents converging towards its lowest portion will cut deep gullies into the
soil of the previous steppe, thus exposing its nature, and at the same time carrying
oft" the salts with which it was impregnated.

  A short sketch was then given of the evidence collected to show that the Loess-

basins of Northern China have formerly been basins without outward .drainage, and
were provided, each of them, with a salt lake in its lowest portion, that they were
gradually drained, one by one, towards the sea, and that this process, consequent

 on slow climatal changes, is still going on along the eastern limit of the salt-lake
plateaux. In the Loess of Northern China is therefore exhibited the nature of the
subaerial deposits which fill the salt basins of Central Asia j but, the salts being
extracted from it, it yields all the conditions required for agriculture and the exist-
 ence of civilized man.

    Baron von Eichthofen finally wished it to be distinctly understood as his opinion

that Loess may have originated in different ways, and that he does not believe the

 theory which he has advanced as to the origin of the Loess of Northern China to
 be applicable in every case where Loess occurs.

. The country which the author described lies between the river Wharfe and
Calder on the north and south, the towns of Leeds and Halifax on the east and

west, having Bradford in the centre.

   The measures included within this area belong to the Carboniferous series,
together with a few patches of drift clay, and gravel, and the alluvial deposits in the

river-valleys.

   The Carboniferous rocks may be divided as follows :

                                                                                                                                                        feet.

Beginning with the lower beds, the author shortly described the lithological cha-

racter of each gi-oup in chronological order.

   The lower part of the Middle Grits consists of shale alternating with bands of
sandstone. The upper portion is principally sandstone with thin bands of shale ; and
the lowest bed of this division is the thick and massive rock which forms Ilkley

Crags and Otley Chevin.
  The flags at the base of the Upper Grit are fine-grained and regularly bedded ; but

they are not always present.

   The Upper Grit itself is a coarse-grained massive sandstone, varying from 80 to
180 feet in thickness. It generally occurs in one bed ; but northwards it lies in two

or three distinct beds.

   The Lower Coal-measures contain five workable seams of coal, ten thin coals

which occasionally attain a thickness of 1 ft. 2 in. and 1 ft. 8 in., and several beds of
sandstone, the principal of which are known under the names of the Elland Flagstone

and the Oakenshaw rock.
   The five principal coals and two sandstones maj' be described thus :

   The Halifax Soft-bed coal maintains a very constant thickness of 1 ft. 4 in., to 1 ft.
8 in. from Halifax northwards, but eastwards it diminshes to a band a few inches

thick.

    The Halifax Hard-bed coal varies from 2 ft. 3 in. in the south to 1 ft. 4 in. in the
north, and like the Soft Bed thins out eastwards to a thin band.

    The Fireclay below the Gannister, on which the coal lies, is often worked along

with the coal, being from 3 to 6 ft. thick.

   The Elland Flagstone includes a group of sandstones, which, being in general thin-
bedded and flaggy, give the name to the rock. It forms large spreads on the higher
ground around Northowram ; and west and north of Bradford the CO- yards rock of
Thornton seems to unite with it and form the thick sandstone at Gaisby Hill.

   The Better-bed coal is one of the most important and valuable coals in the
neighbourhood, attaining a thickness of 3 feet at Horton ; but the average thickness
is about 1 ft. 8 in. ; much value is set on this coal by the Iron Companies in the

district.

   The Black -bed coal is of a .softer nature and inferior qualitj', 2 ft. 4 in. to 2 ft. 6 in.

thick at Low Moor ; but at Farnley and Beeston the lower part of the seam is

converted into an impure stone coal. The value of this coal is enhanced by the

iroq^tone-bearing shale which overlies it. The layers of ironstone are imbedded in

a carbonaceous shale                                                                                                  and  the  average  thickness  of  good ironstone will be  about  5
                                                                                                                   ;

or 6 inches, that portion of it known as the " middle balls " being the richest in

metallic iron.

   The Oakenshaw rock is a well-marked and distinct sandstone over the whole

district from Mirfield toHunsworth, coarse iu grain, thick, and in many cases false-

 bedded.

    The Beeston-bed coal is the representative of an interesting series of coals, which
 occur in the south as the Shertclifte-bed coal and two coal bands, and then as the

 Churwell Thick and Thin coals, and finally as the Beeston bed, uniting the qualities

 as well as the thickness in one seam.

    The Middle Coal-measiu-es contain eleven principal coal seams and two sandstone

 rocks, which are worthy of notice.

    The Blocking coal, the horizon of which indicates the division between the Lower
and Middle Coal-measures, is a coal which has been most extensively worked over
a great portion of this area ; it varies in thickness from 1 ft. 3 in. to 1 ft. 8 in., and

is of a very good quality.

    The Three-quarters or Middleton 11-yards coal is a constant coal, but it is thin
and of an inferior quality within our present limits.

    The Cromwell or Middleton Main coal is a valuable coal, and is generally a soft

coal, but at Birstall part of the seam is converted into Cannel coal. The thickness
is from 1 ft. 7^ in. to 4 ft. G in.

    The Green-Lane or Middleton Little coal, near Dewsbury, is only about 9 inches

or 1 foot thick ; but northwards it improves both in quality and thickness, being as

much as 2 ft. in. to 3 ft. in the district around Morley, and contains a band of semi-

anthracitic coal which is used as a steam coal.

   The Brown-metal coals, three in number, continue constant, though the manner

of their occurrence is varied.

   At Dewsbury we have the series complete, while at White Lee the two upper

beds unite and form the 2-5'ards coal, a parting of about 1 ft. G in. intervening be-
tween the two seams. These two coals are again separated at Bruntcliffe by about
28 feet of shales, while the lowest seam is represented by a band of black shale.

   The Birstall Rock is contained in the measures which lie between these coals
and the Flockton Thin coal. It is a very irregular sandstone, but is largely
developed at Batley Carr, Carlinghow, and Birstall, where it attains a thickness of
100 feet. Much good building-stone is obtained from this rock.

   The Flockton Thin or Adwalton Black bed is about 3 feet thick, and contains a
layer of clay from 2 to 4 inches thick a few inches from the top of the seam. The
seam is very regular, and the quality of an average kindj and it is used as a soft

coal for gas-making.

   The Adwalton Stone coal : the upper portion of this seam is a good cannel coal 6
to 10 inches thick, the total thickness of the bed being from 3 ft. to 3 ft. 6 in.
The roof shale of this coal is recognizable throughout the whole of the Yorkshire
coal-field, being a black shale containing ironstone nodules which are one mass of
Anfhracosia, and is locally known in this district as the " Cockle-shell bed."

   The Joan coal varies from 2 ft. 3 in. to 1 ft. in thickness, but has not been much

worked, though it is of good quality.

   The measures which lie between this coal and the Haigh-Moor coals contain the
sandstone known as the Thornhill rock. This sandstone is regular and uniform in
occurrence and thickness, and will compare in this respect with the sandstones of the
Lower Coal-measures. Good and durable building-stone is obtained from it.

   The Low and Top Haigh-Moor coals are separated from each other at Pildacre
by about 30 feet of shales; northwards the Low coal becomes deteriorated and the

Top coal continues as the Haigh-Moor coal of the country to the north and north-

west.

   The Warren-house or Gawthorpe coal is only present over a very small area near
Chidswell, and is from 7 to 8 feet thick.

                                              The Lie of the Measures.

  By the aid of certain natural lines which occur within this ai-ea, such as the lines of
faults and features of the countrj', we are enabled the more easily to describe the lie

of these beds.

  Beginning with the country on the south-west of the fault from Clifton Common

through Bailiff Bridge to Denholme Clough, the Rough rock stretches away

westwards from under the Coal-measures, while between the top line of that rock
90 KEPOHT--1873.

and tlie fault we have measures as high as the Crow coal, the coals above the
Elland Flagstone putting in a little way west of the fault. This area is broken up
by a number of smaller faults. The Bailiff-Bridge fault begins at Clifton Common,
increases to 62 yards at Norwood Green, and to 150 or 200 yards at Denholme

Clough.

   On the north-east side of the Bailiff-Uridge fault and south of the Bradford

southerly and Harper-Gate faults to the river Calder, there is a tract of country
which is crossed by a number of large faults running nearly north-east and south-
west and north-west and south-east, and a set of smaller faults the direction of which
is approximately east and west. Between the Bradford southerly and Tong faults
and one of these north-east and south-west faults, viz. the Birkenshaw fault, uU the
beds crop out from the Better-bed to the Middleton Main coal which caps the top

of Westgate Hill. On the downcast or south-east side of this fiiult we have mea-
sures up to the base of the Thornhill rock ; and this is again thrown down on the

south-east by the Bruntclifte fault, the amount of throw being about 80 yards ; and
the Haigh-Moor coal is brought in at Soothill by the Upper-Batley fixult, but is
thrown out again at Hanging Heaton on the upcast side of the Staincliffe fault, once
more occurring over the Thornhill rock at Pildacre Hill east of Hewsbury.

   On the north side of the Bradford southerly and Harper-Gate faults, the countiy
is also intersected by many faults, which would require too much space to describe

in any detail ; but between these faults and the top line of the Upper Grit from
Wilsden to Thacldey we liave the beds from the Better-bed coal to the Halifax

Soft coal, while measures nearly as high as the Shortclitfe bed occm* in the trian-
gular space between the Egypt, Fairweather-Green and Leventhorpe-Mill faults,
and in the trough between the Bradford northerly and the Throstle-nest faults, ex-
tending from Chellou Dean to Fagiey.

   The Upper Grit, rising from under the northern edge of the Coal-measures,
stretches away over the high ground to Yeadon and Rumbles moors, surmounted

at Baildon Common and Rawdon by outliers of the Lower Coal-measures, wliile the

Middle Grits, consisting of alternating bands of sandstone and shale, run along the
lower slopes of the valleys.

   The outlier at Baildon contains beds up to the base of the flagstone group, which
lie in regular succession over the Rough rock at Baildon Bank, and are brought

against the grit on the north by the continuation of the Row faiUt.

   The Rawdon outlier is connected with the main portion of the coal-field by the

extension to the north-east of the belt between the Bradford northerly and southerly
faults, the beds cropping out on the east and west sides of this belt above the Upper

Grit, and bounded on the north by a fault running westward through Rawdon
Common.

   The Middle Grits rise to the surface north of Yeadon and Rumbles moors, form
the magnificent escarpnient from Addingham Crag by Ilkley Crags and Otley
Chevin to Bramhope Bank, giving a grandeur to this portion of the Wharfe valley

which, in scenery of this kind, is hardly to be surpassed.

  -- --Boidder-heds. These deposits consist of Boulder-clay and gravels the gravels
--being of two kinds, those found on the high grounds, and those found in the

valleys together with a stiffish clay containing fragments of local stones and which
is probably lacustrine in its origin.

   The Boulder-clay is composed of blackish, bluish, and yellowish clay containing
fragments and blocks of sandstone, grit, limestone, and shale, the blocks of limestone
being in many cases scratched, polished, and angular, though in other cases they

are well rounded as well as striated ; but it is hardly possible to separate the one

from the other. The drift in the Aire basin contains no fragments which may not

--have come from the rocks within the watershed with one exception so far as the

author is aware ; and that is in the valley at and just south of Bradford, where he
found a few pebbles of trap and ash rock as far up towards the watershed between
the Aire and Calder as Rooley and Great Horton, and one block of coarse granite
out of the drift clay on the east side of Bowling Lane between Bowling House and
The Oaks.

    The normal condition of the Boulder-clay in the valleys of the Aire and Wharfe
being as previously described, would lead us to infer that it has been formed by
                                                               TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                        91

some cause acting locally, thougli it miglit probably be due to a universal ice-

sheet.

   The fact of these beds being thickest in the main valleys and extending into the
tributary valleys, the high laud being usually free from them, shows the general
contour of the country to have been much the same in preglacial times as it is now.

   The long ridges of gravel which extend in a somewhat broken and curved line
from Burley Moor to Hawkesworth, are composed of limestone gravel, forming a
bank about CO yards wide and 10 to 20 feet high, being at the north end 1150 feet
and at the south GOO feet above the sea-level, thus running across the gi'ound
irrespective of contour, and seem to be imdoubted Eskers.

   The mounds of gravel which occur in the valley of the Aire at Bingley are
composed of limestone gravel and boulders, the greatest proportion of which are
well-rounded pebbles veith faint traces of strife upon them ; this would point to re-
arranged di-ift, or drift which was subjected to tides and cun-ents dm-ing deposition.
This is further exemplified by the stratification being both up and down the valley,
and might have been formed when the land stood 300 or 400 feet below its present

level, the valley of the Aire being then an inlet of the sea up which the tide ebbed

--and tiowed, and by its action formed these mounds from previously existing material.
   Hiver Deposits. Gravel occurs at Exley Hall and Kirklees Park, 150 feet above
the present river, and is supposed to be of river formation.

   The river-terraces consist of sand, gravel, and clay, and occur in many places

along the course of the main rivers, as at Thornhill Lees in the valley of the

Calder, Oalverley in the valley of t)ie Aire, and in the valley of the Whai-fe almost
continuously from Burley to Poole.

   The recent alluvium is composed of fine loamy clay, sand, and gravel. Many

large trees have beenfoimd imbedded in this alluvium" in the valley of the Calder,
some of them being from 2 to 3 feet in diameter, and 60 feet in length.

    On the Occurrence of Elephant-remaim in the Basement Beds of the Bed
                       Crag. By J. E. Taylor, F.L.S., F.Q.S.

   The author exhibited a tooth from the basement bed of the Red Crag, where
Mastodon and other early Pliocene or late Miocene mammalia are met with. It had
been contended that the elephant-teeth did not come from this bed ; but the author
denied this from personal experience. The tooth in question was very peculiar, from

the width between the ridges, and its singular resemblance to the Mastodon type.

On the Correspondence hetiveen some Areas of ajiparent Upheaval and the

   Thickening of subjacent Beds. By W. Toplet, F.G.S., Geological Survey of

    England.

   The author first referred to some known facts as to the thinning of strata in
certain directions, and he drew attention to the coincidence between the direction

of this thinning and the direction of the general dip. The south-easterly attenua-

tion of the Oolites of Central England (long since proved by Prof. Hull) and the
thinning-out of the Lower Cretaceous rocks under London, were the cases most
fully dwelt upon. Illustrations were also drawn from the Carboniferous rocks of
Yorkshire and Derbyshire, and the Lower Cretaceous rocks on the west of the

Paris basin.

It was shown, as regards the areas described, that the rise of the beds is in that

direction in which the underlying beds obtained their greatest thickness. It has

hitherto been assumed that the rise and dip of strata is due to movements of the

earth's crust                                         but the  author  pointed out that, in  the instances alluded  to, this is
                                                   5

an erroneous conclusion. Only a small portion of tlie apparent upheaval could be

due to this cause, whilst in some cases it seemed that the whole of it could be ex-

plained by the thickening of subjacent beds. The author concluded by pointing

out the important bearing of these facts upon some ciun-eut geological theories, re°

ferring especially to the supposed connexion between the " upheaval " of the Weald
and the existing valley-systems of that area.

                           On ilie Whin Sill of Northumherland.
                By W. TopLET, F.G.S., and G. A. Leboub, F.Q.S.

 . This paper gave the results of work by the authors during the progress of the
Geological Survey, and it was communicated to the Section by permission of the

Director-General of the Survey.

   The Whinstone or Basalt of the north of England occurs in two forms, either as
chjhes cutting through the rocks, or as beds lying amongst them. The intrusive

character of the fonner is undisputed ; but there has always been considerable un-
certainty as to the character of the latter. The authors affirmed that in Northum-

berlandthere could be no doubt whatever that the sheet or sheets of ba.salt known
as the " Whin Sill " were intrusive, and that the trap had been forced through the
rocks long after their deposition and consolidation. The evidence of this was
found in the altered nature of the rocks above the whin, especially when they
consist of shales, and in tlie fact that the whin does not lie at one uniform level
amongst the sedimentary strata, but frequently comes up in bosses, cutting through
the rocks, and shifting its relative position amongst them to the extent of 1000 feet
or more in short distances.

  An account of the literature of the subject was given; and reference was parti-
cularly made to a paper by Sir W. C. Trevelyan, published in 1823 in the ' Werne-

rian Transactions,' in which the intrusive nature of the basalt of North Northum-
berland was clearly shown.

  A note by Mr. S. AUport, F.G.S., was appended to the paper, giving an account

of the microscopic structure of the basalt, showing it to be precisely similar in
character to the intrusive sheets of trap which occur in the coal-field of the midland

qounties.

Note on ihe Occurrence of Thanet Sand and of Cracf in the S. W. j^art of Suffolk

   (Sudbury), ByW. Whitakeb, B.A. (Loud.), of the Geological Survey.

    The author had observed near Sudbury some sections proving the existence of
Thanet Sand in that district. None had previously been observed on the northern
outcrop of the London basin. The sand is fine and loamy, just like that of West
Kent. The author also noticed the occurrence of Crag at Sudbury, at many miles
froiU; and at a higher level than, any previously known.

  Notes on their Geological Position ^c. By Hekey Woodwakd, F.R.S.,

   F.G.S., and IIobeet Etheeidge, jun., F.G.S.

The authors described nine specimens of Phyllopodous Crustaceans, eight of

which are from the Carboniferous series of East Kilbride, and the remaining fonu

from the Old Eed Sandstone (?) of Lanarkshire. They are all referable to the

genus  Dithyrocaris                                                 and  the  authors  described  four  new  species,  namely  :

   The other examples are referred to Dr. Scouler's Bifhyrocaris tricomis and D.
tesiiidinea, both of which were also obtained from the Carboniferous Limestone

series of East Kilbride.

   With regard to D. tricomis, one of the authors (Mr. Woodward) had made the
interesting discovery that the carapace in Dr. Scouler's specimen was folded
together, and that Dr. Scouler had mistaken the true anterior border of the cara-

--pace the three spines, on which the specific diagnosis was founded, being really at

Lesmahagow (see ' Siluria,' 4th edit. 1807, p. 230, Fossils (CK3), fig. 1, and footnote
thereon). The maxillse, which are preserved in situ in Dr. Scouler's specimen,

indicate the true anterior end of the carapace.

New Facts hearinr/ on the Inquiry concerning Forms intermediate between Birds

  and Reptiles. By Henry Woodward, F.B.S., F.G.S., of the British

   Museum.

In this paper the author drew attention to the great hiatus existing at the present

day between Birds and Keptiles, and referred to the researclies of Prof. Huxley and

others in order to show tliat both the Ornithic and Reptilian types were super-

structures raised on the same ground-plan, and that the Chelonia, Ichthyosauria,

Plesiosauria, Pterosauria, and Lacertilia differ fully as much from one another aa

they do from the class Aves.

To associate all these forms together under one great Class, the Sauhopsida, as

proposed by_ Prof. Huxley, is therefore fully justified by the common structui-al

aflinities which they present.

Among existing birds the Ratitce or Struthious birds come nearer to Reptilia than

any other  gi-oup                          and their wide  distribution  attests  their  great antiquity, whilst
                                        ;

their fossil forms occur as low down as the Eocene. The author pointed out that

the Pterosauria only presented an adaptive modification of Avian structures, but

did nothelp to bridge over the gap which exists between these two divisions.

   He cited the remarkable Mesozoic bird (the Arch(sopte)-i/x) as aftbrding a more

generalized type of structure than any other known genus of Aves, the tail being
composed of twenty free vertebrae, and the digits of the wings being armed with

claws.

Two birds had also been described by Prof. 0. C. Marsh from the Cretaceous

shales of Kansas, remarkable for possessing numerous teeth in both jaws, implanted

in distinct sockets, and also biconcave vertebraj.

Lastly, Prof. Owen had just described a new and remarkable bird from the Lon-

don Clay of Sheppey, the Odontopten/x toliapicus, having very prominent denticu-

lations of the alveolar margins of the jaws, which, although not true teeth, no

doubt subserved the function of those prehensile organs.

   From the extreme rarity of all terrestrial-animal remains preserved in a fossil
state, it may be justly concluded that many more such archaic birds with reptilian

modifications actually existed in the Mesozoic epoch, although they may never be

discovered by geologists.

 --The author then referred to the instances of fossil Reptilia which show remark-

able ornithic modifications as, for example, the singular CompsognatAtis loiiffipes
from Solenhofen, a lizard which, from its peculiar conformation, must have hopped

or walked in an erect position, after the manner of a bird, to which its long neck,

small head, short and diminutive anterior limbs gave it an extraordinary resem-

blance.

From the researches of Mantell, Owen, Phillips, Huxley, and Hulke in England,

Cope, Leidy, and other anatomists in America, it would appear that the huge

Dinosauria, the Iguanodon, Megalosaurus, &c., had also diminutive fore limbs and

largely developed hind limbs, whilst from the form of the pelvic bones and the

--anchylosis oi the sacral vertebrae, there can be little doubt they walked in an almost

erect position a conclusion which the bipedal tracks discovered by Mr. S. H.

Beckles tend to confirm.

The author then described a remarkable lizard, the Chlamgdosaurus Kingii from

Australia, which habitually runs upon its hind legs, a mode of progression which

its disproportionately short fore limbs at once suggest as its natural position ; and

as its habits are known to have been observed by Mr. Gerard Krefft and other

naturalists, it affords a most valuable living illustration of a Mesozoic tvpe ap-
proaching birds on the Reptilian side, as the Struthious Birds approach reptiles on

the Avian side.

Some singular tracks from Solenhofen were referred to, which must have been
--94 EEPOET 1873.

made by a bipedal reptile, like Compsof/natlms, or by a reptilian-like bird, sucK

as Archaopteryx, having a long rat-like tail.

Address hy Geoege J. Allman, M.D., LL.D., F.R.S., F.R.S.E., M.B.LA.,

                                     F.L.S., President of the Section.

For some years it has been the practice at the Meetings of this Association for the

special Presidents to open the work of their respective Sections with an Address,

which is supposed to differ, in the greater generality of its subject, from the ordi-

nary communications to the Sections. Finding that dui'ing the present Meeting

this duty would devolve on myself, I thought over the available topics, and con-

cluded that a few words on the Present Aspect of Biology and the Method of

Biological Study would best satisfy the conditions imposed.

myI shall endeavour to be as little technical as  subject will allow ; and thouo'h

I know that there are here present many to whom I cannot expect to convey any

truths with which they are not already familiar, yet in an Address of this kind

the speaker has no right to take for granted any large amount of scieutific know-

ledge in his audience. Indeed one of the cliief advantages which result from

these Meetings of the British Association consists in the stimulus they give

to inquiry, in the opportunity they afl'ord to many of becoming acquainted for

the first time with the established truths of science, and the initiation among

them of new lines of thought.

And this is undoubtedly no small gain ; for how many are there who, though

they may have reaped all the advantages which our established educational systems

can bestow, are yet sadly deficient in a knowledge of the world of life which

surrounds them. It is a fair and wonderful world, this eai-th on which we have

our dwelling-place ; and vet how many wander over it unheedingly ! by how many

have its lessons of wisdom never been read 1 how many have never spared a

thought on the beauty of its forms, the harmony of its relations, the deep meaning

of its laws I

And with all this there is assuredly implanted in man an undying love of such

knowledge. From his imshaken faith in causation he yearns to deduce the

unknown from the known, to look beyond what is at hand and obvious to what is

remote and imseen.

       Coiicejition of Bioloyy and Function of the Scienti/ic Method.

Under the head of Biology are included all those departments of scientific

research which have as their object the investigation of the living beings, the

plants and the animals, which tenant the surface of our earth, or have tenanted it

in past time.

  --It admits of being studied under two grand heads Morphology, which treats of

Fomi,  and     Phj'siology, which  treats  of Function                                                              and  oesides  these  there are
                                                                                                                 ;

certain departments of biological study to which both Morphology and Phy.siology

contribute, such as Classification, Disti'ibution, and that dep.irtment of research

which is concerned with the origin and causes of living and extinct forms.

   By the aid of observation and experiment we obtain the elements which are to

be combined and developed into a science of living beings ; and it is the function of

the scientific method to indicate the mode in which the combinations are to be

eflected, and the path which the development must pursue. Without it the

results gained would be but a confused assemblage of isolated facts and die-

connected phenomena; but, aided by a philoaophic metlicd, the observed facta
become scientific propositions, what was apparently insignificant becomes full of
meaning, and we get glimpses of the consummate laws which govern the whole.

   I shall leave the consideration of Biology in its purely physiological aspect to
the President of the Physiological Subsection, and shall here confine myself to
those departments which are more or less controlled by morphological laws.

              Importance of Anatomy.

The first step in our morphological study of living beings is to obtain an

accurate and aclequate knowledge of the forms of the individual objects which

present themselves to lis in our contemplation of the animal and vegetable

kingdoms. For such knowledge, however, much more is needed than an acquaint-

Weance with their external figure.  must subject them to a searching scrutiny;

we must make ourselves familiar with their anatomy, which involves not only a

knowledge of the forms and disposition of their organs, internal as well as external,
but of their liistology or the microscopic structm-e of the tissues of which these
organs are composed. Histology is nothing more than anatomy carried to its
extreme term, to that point where it meets with the morphological unit, the ulti-
mate element of form, and the simplest combinations of this out of which all the

organs in the living body are built up.

  Among the higher animals Anatomy, in the ordinary sense of the word, is

suificiently distinct from Histology to admit of separate study ; but in the lower

animals and in plants the two become confounded at so many points as to render

their separate study often impracticable.

  Now the gi-eat prominence given to Anatomy is one of the points which most

eminently distinguish the modern schools of Biology.

              Development,

Another order of morphological facts of no less importance than those ob-

tained from anatomical study is derived from that of the changes of form which

Wethe individual experiences during the coiu'se of its life.  know that every

organized being commences existence as a simple sphere of protoplasm, and that

from this condition of extreme generalization all but the very lowest pass through

phases of higher and higher specialization, acquiring new parts and differentiating

new tissues. The sum of these changes constitute the development of the

organism ; and no series of facts is more full of significance in their bearing on

biological science than that which is derived from the philosophic study of

Development.

              Classification an H.ipression of Affinities.

   Hitherto we have been considering the individual organism without any direct

reference to others ; but the requirements of the biological method can be

Nowsatisfied only by a comparison of the various organisms one with the other.

the grounds of such comparison may be various ; but what we are at present con-

cerned with will be found in anatomical sti-ucture and in developmental changes
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and in each of these directions facts of the highest order and of great significance

become apparent.

   By a carefully instituted comparison of one organism with another, we discover

the resemblances as well .as the difl'erences between them. If these resemblances be

strong and occur in important points of structure or development, we assert that
there is an affinity between the compared organisms, and we assume that the

closeness of the affinity varies directly with the closeness of the resemblance.

It is on the determination of these affinities that all philosophic classification

Aof animals and plants must be based.  philosophic classification of organized

beings aims at being a succinct statement of the affinities between the objects so

classified, these affinities being at the same time so set forth as to have their

various degrees of closeness and remoteness indicated in the classification.

    Affinities have long been recognized as the giounds of a natural biological

classification; but it is only quite lately that a new significance has been given to
them by the assumption that they may indicate something more than simple
--96 REPORT 1873.

--agreement with a common plan that they may be derived by inheritance from a

common ancestral form, and that they therefore afford evidence of a true blood-

relationsliip between the organisms presenting them.

   The recognition of this relationship is the basis of what is known as the Descent
Theory. No one doubts that the resemblances we notice among the members of
such small groups as those we name species are derived by inheritance from a
common ancestor ; and the Descent Theory is simply the extension to the larger
groups of this same idea of relationship.

    If this be a true principle, then biological classification becomes an exposition

--of family relationship a genealogical tree in which the stem and branches indi-

cate various degrees of kinship and direct and collateral lines of descent. It
is this conception which takes classification out of the domain of the purely

morphological.

               Affinity determined hy the study of Anatomy and Devidopment.

   Prom what has just been said, it follows that it is mainly by a comparison of

organisms in their anatomical and developmental characters that their affinities
are discoverable. The structure of an organism will, in by far the greater number
of cases, be sufficient to indicate its true affinity ; but it sometimes happens that
certain members of a group depart in their structure so widely from the characters
of the t3'pe to which they belong, that without some other evidence of their affi-
nities no one would think of assigning them to it. This evidence is afibrded by
development.

  An example or two will serve to make the subject clear; and we shall first take

one from a case where, without a knowledge of anatomical structure, we should

easily go astr.ay in our attempts to assign to the forms under examination their

true place in the classification.

   If we search our coasts at low water we shall be sure to meet with certain

plant-like animals spreading over the rocks or rooted to the fronds of sea-weeds,
all of which present so close a resemblance to one another as to have led to their
being brought together by the zoologists of a few years ago into a single group,

to which, under the name of " Polypes," a definite place was assigned in the
classification of the animal kingdom. They are all composite animals, consisting
of an association of buds or zooids which remain organically imited to one another
and give to the whole assemblage the appearance, in many cases, of a little
branching tree. Every bud carries a delicate transparent cup, within which is
contained the principal part of the animal, and from which this has the power of
spontaneously protruding itself ; and when thus protruded it will be seen to pre-
sent a beautiful crown of tentacles surrounding a mouth, througli which food is
taken into a stomach. As long as no danger threatens, the little animal will
continue displayed with its beautiful coronal of tentacles expanded ; but touch it
ever so lightly, and it will instantly close up its tentacles, retract its whole body,
and take refuge in the recesses of its protecting cup.

   So far, then, there is a complete agreement between the animals which have
been thus associated under the designation of Polypes ; and in all that concerns
their external form no one point can be adduced in opposition to the justice of

this association. When, however, we pass below the surface and bring the micro-
scope and dissecting-needle to bear on their internal organization, we find that
among the animals thus formed so apparently alike we have two totally distinct

--types of structure : that while in one the mouth leads into a simple excavation of

the body on which devolves the whole of the functions which represent digestion,
in the other there is a complete alimentary tract entirely shut oft' from the proper
cavity of the body and consisting of distinctly difterentiated oesophagus, stomach,
and intestine ; while in the one the muscular system consists of an indistinct
layer of fibres intimately imited in its whole extent with the body-walls, in the

other there are distinctly differentiated free bundles of muscles for the purpose of

effecting special motions in the economy of the animal ; while in the one no dif-
ferentiatect nervous system can be detected, in the other there is a distinct nervous
ganglion with nervous filaments. In fact the two forms are shown, by a study of
their anatomical structui-e, to belong to two entirely different primary divisions
       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.     97

of the animal kingdom ; for while the one has a close affinity with the little
freshwater Hydra, and is therefore referred to the Hydroida among the sub-
kingdom Crelenterata, the other is referable to the group of the Polyzoa, has its
immediate affinities with the Ascidians, and belongs to the great division of the

Molluseoida.

  We shall next take an example in which the study of development, rather than

of anatomy, affords the clue to the true affinities of the organism.

   Attached to the abdomen of various crabs may often be seen certain soft fleshy
sacs, to which the name of Saccidina has been given. They hold their place by
means of a branching root-like extension, which penetrates the abdomen of the

crab and winds itself round its intestine or dives into its liver, within which its

fibres ramify like the roots of a tree.

   Now the question at once presents itself, What position in the animal kingdom

are we to assign to this immovably-rooted sac, destitute of mouth and of almost
every other organ with which we are in the habit of associating the structm-e of

an animal ?

   Anatomy will here be powerless in helping us to arrive at a conclusion ; for the
dissecting-knife shows us little more than a closed sac filled with eggs, and fixed
by its tenacious roots in the viscera of its victim. Let us see, however, what we
learn from development. If some of the eggs with which the Sacculina is filled

be placed in conditions suited to their development, they give origin to a form as
different as can well be imagined from the Sacculina. It is an active, somewhat
oval-shaped little creature, covered with a broad dorsal shield or carapace, and
furnished with two pairs of strong swimming-feet, which carry long bristles, and
also with a pair of anterior limbs or antennae. It is, in fact, identical with a form

known to zoologists by the name of " Nauplius," and which has been proved to
be one of the young states of the Barnacle and of other lower Crustacea ; while
even some of the higher Crustacea have been observed to pass through a similar

stage.

   After a short time the Nauplius of our Sacculina changes its form ; the carapace

folds down on each side and assumes the shape of a little bivalve shell, while six
new pairs of swimming-feet are developed. The little animal continues its active

natatory life, and in tliis stage it is again identical in all essential points with one

of the .young stages of the Earnacle.

   In the mean time a remarkable change takes place in the two antennae ; they
become curiously branched and converted into prehensile organs. The young
Sacculina now looks out for the crab on which it is to spend parasiticaUy the rest

of its life ; it loses its bivalve shell ; the prehensile antennae take hold of its
victim, and penetrate the soft skin of its abdomen, in order to seek within it the
nutriment which is there so plentifully present ; locomotion is gone for ever, and
the active and symmetrical Nauplius becomes converted into the inert and shape-

less Sacculina.

   The nearest affinities of Sacculina are thus undoubtedly with the Barnacles,
which have been proved, both on anatomical and developmental grounds, to belong

to the gi-eat division of the Crustacea.

         A philosophical classification cannot form a single rectilineal series.

  A comparison of animals with one another having thus resulted in establishing

their affinities, we may arrange them into groups, some more nearly, others more
remotely related to one another. The various degrees and directions of affinity

will be expressed in every philosophical arrangement ; and as these affinities ex-
tend in various directions, it becomes at once apparent that no arrangement of

organized beings in a straight line, ascending lilve the steps of a ladder from lower
to higher forms, can give a true idea of the relations of such beings to one another.
These relations, on the contrary, can be expressed only by a ramified and complex

figure, which we have already compared to that of a genealogical tree.
   The following diagram will approximately express the affinities of the leading

groups of the animal kingdom :

                                                         Homology.

In the comparison of organized beings with one another, certain relations of

great interest and significance become apparent between various organs. These

are known by the name of Homologies ; and organs are said to be homologous

with one another when they can be proved to be constructed on the same funda-

mental plan, no matter how different they may be in form and in the functions

which they may bo destined to execute. Organs not constructed on the same fun-

damental plan may yet execute similar functions ; and then, whether they do or

do not resemble one another in form, they are said to be merely analogous ; and

some of the most important steps in modern Biology have resulted from attention

to the distinction between Homology and Analogy, a distinction which was entirely

disregarded by the earlier schools.

The nature of Homology and its distinction from Analogy will be beat under-

stood by a few examples.

Compare the wing of a bird with that of an insect ; there is a resemblance be-

tween them  in  external  form                           there  is  also  an  identity  of function,               both  organs
                                                      ;

being constructed for the purposes of flight : and j-et they are in no respect homo-

logous ; for they are formed on two distinct plans, which have nothing whatever in
common. The relation between them is simply that of analogy.

On the other hand, no finer illustrations of Homology can be adduced than

those which are afforded by a comparison with one another of the anterior limbs of

the various members of the Vertebrata. Let us compare, for example, the anterior

limb of man with the wing of a bird. Here we have two organs between which

--the ordinary observer would fail to recognize any resemblance organs, too, whose

functions are entirely different, one being formed for prehension, and the other for

flight. When, however, they are compared in the light which a philosophic ana-

tomy is capable of throwing on them, we find between the two a parallelism which

points to one fundamental type on which they are both constructed.

There is, first, the shoulder-girdle, or system of bones by which in each case the

Nowlimb is connected with the rest of the skeleton.                            this part of the skeleton in

man is very different in form from the same part in the bird ; and yet a comparison

of the two shows us that the difference maiuly consists in the fact that the coracoid,

which in man is a mere process of the scapula, is in the bird developed as an inde-

pendent bone, and in the further fact that the two clavicles in man ai-e in the bird

united into a single V-shaped bone or " furcula." Then, if we compare the ami,

forearm, vrrist, and hand in the human skeleton with the various parts which

follow one another in the same order in the skeleten of the bird's wing, we shall

find between the two series a correspondence which the adaptation to special func-

tions may in some regions mask, but never to such an extent as to render the

fundamental unity of plan uudiscoverable by the method of the higher anatomy.

As far as regards the arm and forearm, these in the bird are nearly repetitions of

their condition in the  human skeleton                                                                             but the parts  which follow  appear at  first

yet a common type can be traced with great distinctness through the two. Thus

the wi-ist is present in the bird's wing as well as in the anterior limb of man but
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

while in man it is composed of eight small irregularly shaped bones, an-anged in

two rows, in the wing it has become greatly modified," the two rows being reduced

to one, and the eight bones to two. Lastly, the hand is also represented in the
wing, where it constitutes a very important part of the organ of fiight, but where

it has undergone such great modification as to be recognizable only after a critical

comparison ; for the five metacarpal bones of the human hand are reduced to two,

consolidated with one another at their proximal and distal ends ; and then the five
fingers of the hand are in the wing reduced to three, which represent the middle

finger, fore finger, and thumb. The fore finger in the bird consists of only one

phalanx, the middle of two, and the thumb forms a small stylet-like bone spring-

ing from the proximal end of the united metacarpals.

In the case now adduced we have an example of the way in which the same

organ in two different animals may become very differently modified in form, so as

to fit it for the performance of two entirely different fmictions, and yet retain suffi-

cient conformity to a common plan to indicate a fimdamental unity of structure.

Let us     take  another  example                                           and  this                              I  shall  adduce  from  the  Vegetable  King-

occupied.

There are the parts known as tendrils, thread-like organs, usually rolling them-

selves into spu'als, and destined, by twining round some fixed support, to sustain

Weclimbing plants in their efforts to raise themselves from the ground.                                                                                    shall

their homological significance.

there is given oft' a pair of tendrils, by means of which the Smilax clings to the

surrounding vegetation in an inextricable entanglement of flexile branches and

bright glossy green foliage.

With the tendrils of the Smilax let us compare those of the Lathyms aphaca, a

little vetch occasionally met with in waste places and the margins of corn-fields.
The leaves are represented by arrow-shaped leaf-like appendages, which are placed

opposite to one another in pairs upon the stem; but instead of each of these

carrying two tendrils at its origin, like the lea\'es of the Smilax, a single tendril

springs from the middle point between every pair.

   The tendrils in the two cases, though similar in appearance and in function,

--diff'er thus in number and arrangement ; and the questions occur : Are they homo-

logous with one another, or are they only analogous ? and if they are only analo-

gous, can we trace between them and any other organ homologous relations ?

   To enable us to decide this point, we must bear in mind that a leaf, when typi-

--cally developed, consists of three portions the lamina or blade, the petiole or leaf-

stalk, and a pair of foliaceous appendages or stipules placed at the base of the leaf-

Nowstalk.  this typical leaf affords the key to the homologies of the tendrils in

the two cases under examination.

   Take the Smilax. In tliis case there are no stipules of the ordinary form ; but
the two tendrils hold exactly the position of the stipules in our t^'pe leaf, and must

                                                                                                                                                7*
100 REPORT-- 1873.

Webe regarded as representing them.     have only to imagine these stipules so

modified in their form as to become reduced to two long spiral threads, and we shall

at once have the tendrils of the Simla.v. On the other hand, let the stipules in our

type remain as leaf-like organs, and let the rest of the leaf (the lamina and petiole)

lose its normal character and become changed into a spiral thread, and we shall

then have the stipules of our type leaf retained in the two opposite leaf-like organs

of the Lathyrus, while the remainder of the type leaf will present itself in the con-

dition of the irt^/«/r«s-tendril which springs from the central point between them.

The tendrils of the Smilax and of the Lathyrus aphaca are thus not homologous

with one another, but only analogous ; while those of the Smilax are homologous
with a pair of stipules, and those of the Lathyrus homologous with the lamina and

petiole of a leaf.

Besides the homology discoverable between the organs of different animals and

plants, a similar i-elation can be traced between organs in tlie same animal or
plant, as, for example, tliat between the different segments of the vertebral column

(which can be shown to repeat one another homologically), and that between the

parts composing the various verticils of the flower and leaves in the plant.

The existence of homological relations such as have been just illustrated admits

of an easy explanation by the application of the doctrine of Descent, according to

which the two organs compared would originate from a common ancestral form.
In accordance with this hypothesis, Homology would mean an identity of genesis

in two organs, as Analogy would mean an identity of function.

                    Distribution and Evolution.

Another very iniportant department of biological science is that of the distribu-

tion of organized beings. This may be either Distribution in Space (Geographical

Distribution) or Distribution in Time (Palfeoutological Distribution). Both of these

have of late years ac((uired increased  significance                                                       for we  have  begun to get more
                                                                                                        ;

distinct glimpses of the laws by which they are controlled, of the origin of Faunas

and Floras, and of the causes which regulate the sequence of life upon the earth.

Time, however, wnll not allow to enter upon this subject as fully as its interest and

importance would deserve ; and a few words on palseontological distribution is all

that I can now venture on.
   The distribution of organized beings in time has lately come before us in a new

light, by the application to it of the hypothesis of Evolution. According to this

hypothesis, the higher groups of organized beings now existing on the earth's sur-

face have come down to us, with gi-adually increasing complexity of structure, by a

continuous descent from forms of extreme simplicity which constituted the earliest

life of our planet.

   In almost every group of the animal kingdom the members which compose it
admit of being arranged in a continuous series, passing down from more specialized
or higher to more generalized or lower forms ; and if we have any record of ex-
tinct members of the group, the series may be carried on through these. Now,

while the Descent hj'pothesis obliges us to regard the various terms of the series

as descended from one another, the most generalized fonns will be found among
the extinct ones ; and the further back in time we go the simpler do the forms

become.

   By a comparison of the forms so arranged we obtain, as it were, the law of the

series, and can thus form a conception of the missing terms, and continue the

series backwards through time, even where no record of the lost forms can be

found, untU from simpler to still simpler terms we at last arrive at the conception
of a term so generalized that we may regard it as the primordial stock, the ances-

tral form from which all the others have been derived by descent.

This root form is thus not actually observed, but is rather obtained by a process

Weof deduction, and is therefore hypothetical.                                                             shall strengthen, however, its

Em-claims to acceptance by the application of another principle. The study of

bryology shows that the higher animals, in the course of their development, pass

through transitory phases which have much in common with the permanent con-

dition of lower members of the type to which they belong, and therefore with ite
                      TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                                   101

Weextinct representatives.   are tlius enabled to lay down the further principle,

that the individual, in the course of its own development from the eg^ to the fully

formed state, recapitulates within that short period of time the various forms which

its ancestry presented in consecutive epochs of the world's history ; so that if we
knew all the stages of its individual development, we should have a key to the

long line of its descent. Through the hypothesis of Evolution, palteontology and

embryology are thus brought into mutual bearing on one another.

Let us take an example in which these two principles seem to be illustrated.

In rocks of the Silurian age there exist in great profusion the remarkable fossils

known as Graptolites. These consist of a series of little cups or cells arranged

along  the sides  a  common  tube                          and the whole fossil  presents  so  close  a resem-
                                                        ;

blance to one of the Sertularian hydroids which inhabit the waters of our present

seas as to justify the suspicion that the Graptolites constitute an ancient and long

since extinct group of the Hydroida. It is not, however, with the proper cells, or

hydrothecEB, of the Sertulariaus that the cells of the Graptolite most closely agree,

but rather with the little receptacles which in certain Sertularinre belonging to the

family of the Plumularidte we find associated with the h3'drothec8e, and which are
Aknown as " nematophores."
                             comparison of structure, then, shows that the Grap-

tolite may, with considerable probability, be regarded as representing a Plumu-

laria in which the hydrothecse had never been developed, and in which their place

had been taken by the nematophores.

  Now it can be shown that the nematophores of the living Plumularidse are filled

with masses of protoplasm which have the power of throwing out pseudopodia, or

long processes of their substance, and that they thus resemble the Rhizopoda,

whose soft parts consist entirely of a similar protoplasm, and which stand among

the Protozoa, or lowest gi-oup of the animal kingdom. If we suppose the hydro-
thecfe suppressed in a Plumularian, we should thus nearly convert it into a colony

of Rhizopoda, from which it would differ only in the somewhat higher morpho-
logical differentiation of its ccenosarc, or common living bond by which the indi-

viduals of the colony are organically connected. And just such a colony would,

under this view, a Graptolite be, waiting only for the development of hydrothecse

to raise it into the condition of a Plumularian.

   Bringing, now, the Evolution hypothesis to bear upon the question, it would

follow that the Graptolite may be viewed as an ancestral form of the Sertularian

hydroids, a form having the most intimate relations with the Rhizopoda, that

hydranths and hydrothecEe became developed in its descendants, and that the

Ilhizopodal Graptolite became thus converted in the lapse of ages into the hy-

droidal Sertularian.

   This hj'pothesis would be strengthened if we found it agreeing with the pheno-

mena of individual development. Now such Plumularidse as have been followed

in their development from the egg to the adult state do actually present well-

developed metamoi-phoses before they show a trace of hydrothecse, thus passing in

the course of their embryological development through the condition of a Grapto-

lite, and recapitidating within a few days stages which it took incalculable ages to

bring about in the palseontological development of the tribe.

   I have thus dwelt at some length on the doctrine of Evolution because it has
given a new direction to biological study, and must powerfully influence all futtire

researches. Evolution is the highest expression of the fundamental principles

established by Mr. Darwin, and depends on the two admitted faculties of living

beings heredity, or the transmission of characters from the parent to the offspring,

and adaptivity, or the capacity of having these characters more or less modified

in the offspring by external agencies or, it may be, by spontaneous tendency to

variation.

   The hypothesis of Evolution may not, it is true, be yet established on so sure a
basis as to command instantaneous acceptance ; and for a generalization of such

vast significance no one can be blamed in demanding a broad and indisputable

foimdation of facts. Whether, however, we do or do not accept it as a necessary

deduction from established facts, it is at all events certain that it embraces a greater

number of phenomena and suggests a more satisfactory explanation of them thau
any other hypothesis which has yet been proposed.
102 REPORT-- 1873.

   With all our admiration, however, for the doctrine of Evolution, as one of the
most fertile and comprehensive of philosophic hypotheses, we cannot shut our eyes
to the difficulties which lie in the way of accepting it to the full extent which has

been sometimes claimed for it. It must be borne in mind that though among
some of the higher Vertebrata we can trace back for some distance in geological
time a continuous series of forms which may safely be regarded as derived from

one another by gradual modification (as has been done, for example, so success-

fully by Prof. Pluxley in the case of the Horse), yet the instances are very few in
which such a sequence has been actually established ; while the first appearance

on the earth's crust of the various classes presents itself in forms which by no

means belong to the lowest or most generalized of their living representatives. On
this fact, however, I do not lay much stress ; for it will admit of explanation by

referring it to the deficiency of the geological record, and then demanding a lapse
of time (of enormous length, it is true) diuing which the necessary modifications

would be in progress before the earliest phase of which we have any knowledge

could have been reached.

   Again, we must not lose sight of the hypothetical nature of those primordial
forms in which we regard the branches of our genealogical tree as taking their
origin ; and while the doctrine of the recapitulation of ancestral forms has much

probability, and harmonizes with the other aspects of the Evolution doctrine into
a beautifully symmetrical system, it is one for which a sufficient number of actually

observed facts have not yet been adduced to remove it altogether from the region

of hypothesis.

   Even the case of the Graptolites already adduced is an illustration rather than a

proof; for the difficulty of determining the true nature of such obscure fossils is so

great, that we may be altogether mistaken in our views of their structure and

affinities.

   To me, however, one of the chief difficulties in the way of the doctrine of evolu-
tion, when carried to the extreme length for which some of its advocates contend,

appears to be the unbroken continuity of inherited life which it necessarily requires

through a period of time whose vastness is such that the mind of man is utterly

incapable of comprehending it. Vast periods, it is true, are necessary in order to
render the phenomena of evolution possible ; but the vastness which the antiquity
of life, as shown by its remains in the oldest fossiliferous strata, requires lis to give

to these periods may be even greater than is compatible with continuity.

  We have no reason to suppose that the reproductive faculty in organized beings

is endowed with unlimited power of extension ; and yet, to go no further back than
the SUm-ian period (though the seas which bore the Eozoon were probably as far

anterior to those of the Silurian as these are anterior to our own), the hypothesis of

evolution, when carried to the extreme length of which it seems susceptible,
requires that in that same Silurian period the ancestors of the present living forms
must have existed, and that their life had continued by inheritance through all the

--ramifications of a single genealogical tree down to our own time the bi'anches of

the tree, it is true, here and there falling away, with the extinction of whole genera
and families and tribes, but stUl some always remaining to carry on the life of the

base through a period of time to all intents and purposes infinite. It is ti'ue that

in a few cases a continuous series of forms, regularly passing from lower to higher

degrees of specialization, and very probably connected with one another by direct

--descent, may be followed through long geological periods as, for example, the gra-

duated series, already alluded to, which may be traced between certain mammals of

the Eocene and others living in our own time, as well as the very low forms which

have come down  to  us, apparently unmodified, from the epoch of  tlie  Chalk                                 but
                                                                                                           ;

incalculably gi-eat as are these periods, they are but as the swing of the pendulum

in a millennium, when compared with the time which has elapsed since the first

animalization of our globe.

   Is the faculty of reproduction so wonderfully tenacious as all this, that through

periods of inconceivable dm'ation, and exposed to influences the most intense and

the most varied, it has still come down to us in an unbroken stream ? Have the
strongest, which had survived in the struggle for existence, necessarily lianded

petual heirloom, the life which they had themselves inherited ? Or have there

--Deen many total extinctions and many renewals of life a succession of genealo-

gical trees, the earlier ones becoming old and decayed and dying out, and their
place taken by new ones which have no kinship with the others ? Or, finally, is
the doctrine of evolution only a working hypothesis, which, like certain algebraic

fictions, may j'et be of inestimable value as an instrument of research ? For as the

higher calculus becomes to the physical inquirer a power by which he unfolds the

laws of the inorganic world, so may the hypothesis of evolution, though only an hy-

pothesis, furnish the biologist with a key to the order and hidden forces of the world
of life ; and what Leibnitz, and Newton, and Hamilton have been to the physicist,
is it not that which Darwin has been to the biologist ?

    But even accepting as a great truth the doctrine of evolution, let us not attribute

to it more than it can justly claim. No valid evidence has yet been adduced to

lead us to believe that inorganic matter has become transformed into living other-

wise than through the agency of a preexisting organism ; and there remains a

residual phenomenon still entirely unaccounted for. No physical hypothesis,

founded on any indisputable fact, has yet explained the origin of the primordial
protoplasm, and, above all, of its marvellous properties, which render evolution

 possible.

    Accepting, then, the doctrine of evolution in all freedom, and with all its legiti-
 mate consequences, there remains, I say, a great residuum unexplained by physical
 theories. Natural selection, the struggle for existence, the survival of the fittest,

will explain much, but they will not explain all. They may offer a beautiful and

convincing theory of the present order and fitness of the organic universe, as the
 laws of attraction do of the inorganic ; but the properties with which the primordial
protoplasm is endowed (its heredity and its adaptivity) remain imexplained by
 them ; for these pi'operties are their cause, and not their effect.

    For the cause of this cause we have sought in vain among the physical forces
which surround us, until we are at last compelled to rest upon an independent voli-
 tion, a far-seeing intelligent design. Science may yet discover, even among the

--laws of physics, the cause it looks for ; it may be that even now we have glimpses

 of it that those forces among which recent physical research has demonstrated so
gi-and a imity (light, heat, electricity, magnetism), when manifesting themselves
 through the orgauizable protoplasm, become converted into the phenomena of life
iind that the poet has unconsciously enunciated a great scientific truth when he

 tells us of

                                            " G-ay lizards glittering on the walls
                               Of ruined shrines, busy and bright,
                                As though they were alive with lights

   But all this is oxAj carrying us one step back in the grand generalization. All
science is but the intercalation of causes, each more comprehensive than that
which it endeavours to explain, between the great primal cause and the ultimate

efiect.

   I have thus endeavoured to sketch for you, in a few broad outlines, the leading
aspects of biological science, and to indicate the directions which biological studies

must take. Our science is one of grand and solemn import ; for it embraces man

himself, and is the exponent of the laws which he must obey. Its subject is vast
for it is life, and life stretches back into the illimitable past, and forward into the
illimitable future. Life, too, is everywhere. Over all this wide earth of ours, from
the equator to the poles, there is scarcely a spot which has not its animal or its
vegetable denizens--dwellers on the mountain and on the plain, in the lake and on

--the prairie, in the arid desert and the swampy fen from the tropical forest, with its

strange forms and gorgeous colours and myriad voices, to the ice-fields of polar
latitudes and those silent seas which lie beneath them, where living things un-
known to warmer climes congregate in unimaginable multitudes. There is life all

over the solid earth ; there is life throughout the vast ocean, from its surface down

to its great depths, dLeper still than the lead of sounding-line has reached.

   And it is with these living hosts, unbounded in their varietj', infinite in their
numbers, that the student of biology must make himself acquainted. It is no light

                            By Professor Gulliver, F.R.S.

   The author, remarking how much microscopists have of late been interested by

the diverse appearances on the surface of certain seeds, expresses his opinion that

the value of observations of this kind might be much increased if they were carried

a little deeper into the texture of the seed-coat and pericarp. In one or other of these
parts he finds short prismatic crystals, apparently of oxalate of lime, constantly present

in many plants, and as constantly absent from the same parts of other plants ; and,

as regards the frequent and true remark that such crystals occur in numberless plants,
he submits that this is no answer to the rational question as to the orders or species
which are or are not characterized by certain saline crystals in the testa or other
part of the plant. Illustrative drawings were exhibited of the crystals in Geranium
and Ribes and of the crystals in Ulmus and Compositne engravings had been pub-

                                                        ;

lished in the ' Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science,' July 1873, and 'Science

Gossip,' May 1873. In the present paper he describes the crystals in Tiliacese, Ace-

racese, Geraniacese, Grossulariacese, Composites, PrimulaceiB, and Dioscoreacese.
   The crystals occur regularlj' studded in plainly defined cells and, though, very

variable in size, have an average diameter of about -^-^-^^-^ of an inch, and in form
are square, oblong, lozenge-shaped, commonly belong to one or other of the pris-
matic systems, but often are merely granular or otherwise iiTegular like certain starch-
granules, though easily distinguishable therefrom by the iodine test. The author,
in conclusion, expressed the hope that both neophytes and experts would pay more
attention to this branch of phytotomy, especially as such observations, and the
minute structure of plants generally, have been and still are sadly neglected in
even the most comprehensive books of descriptive, botany and micrography.

the district. He then showed the course of the various riversheds, and the work

which has been done in each. The Wharfe, Upper Aire, and Calder are the best
worked for mosses, the others having been scarcely touched upon yet.

   Many rarities have already been found; and when the other more southern dis-

tricts have been thoroughly examined, the author was of opinion that the list of

Mosses would be largely increased. He then described a few of the principal new

and rarer species, and concluded by recommending the West-Kidiug botanists to

direct their studies to the Mosses.  ^_^

On some of the Changes going on in the South-African Vegetation through the
                Introduction of the Merino Sheep, By John Shaw.

   The author commenced by referring to the fact that civilization and Merino
sheep had introduced one obnoxious plant (the Xantldum spinosicm) into the
sheep-walks of South Africa. As its achenes get into the wool and seriously

injure its value, the Government have legislated for its compulsory destruction.
In the Orange-River Free State, where there was no legislation on the weed until
lately, wool had become so filled with these that its value was deteriorated nearly
50 per cent. Sheep also, in conseqiience of the overstocking of farms in the inland
districts of the Cape, are doing very serious injury directly by eating down the
better and more agreeable plants, giving range to poisonous and bitter ones, and
even so changing the climate as to make the country better suited to the plants of
the neighbouring regions, which march into the sheep-walks to aid the sheep in

thrusting out and extirpating the indigenous flora.
   After sketching the distribution of plants in South Africa, the author went on

to particularize the character of the prairie-like midlands of the Cape, -wdth their
luxuriant grass and vegetation. Since sheep have been introduced the grass has
fast disappeared, the ground (by the hurried march of the sheep for food amongst
a scattered bush) has become beaten and hardened, and the seasonable rains which
do come are accordingly allowed to run off the surface without soaking into the

ground to the extent formerly the case. The country is thus drying up, the foun-
tains becoming smaller and smaller, and the prospect is very clear that the midland

regions will turn into a semi-desert. Indeed the plants of the singular regions

known as the Karoo, in the south-west of the Cape (which from its position is
locked in to the north and south by mountains, and is favoured little by rain), are
travelling northwards rapidly and occupying this now similar dry tract of country.
The herbage is essentially a Karoo one already. It contains most prominently

Karoo plants, such as the Chrysocomas and the Mytroj)appi.
    The author further referred to the great increase of poisonons and bitter herbage.

It is dangerous to have stock in many farms, which formerly were free from any in-

                   On Fern-stems and Petioles of the Coal-measures.
                       By Professor "W. C. Williamson, F.R.S.

   The author described the structui-e of several stems of Calamites and Lycopodia-
ceous plants from the Coal-measures, in which a thick vascular zone intervened
between a central pith and an outer hark, and which zone increased in thickness
by successive additions made to its external surface through the genetic agency of
the innermost layer of the bark. Adopting these plants as typical representatives
of a condition wholly unknown amongst living Cryptogams, he called attention to
a series of stems from the Coal-measures which bore the appearance of being the
petioles and rhizomes of ferns. One of these, to which he had previously assigned
the provisional name of Edraxylon, he now showed to be an undoubted fern, since
he has obtained it with leaflets attached to it. This plant proves to be one of the
species oi Pecopteris in which the rachis and petiole is covered with minute tubercles,
as in some recent Cyatheas. After examining a series of other stems, including the
Stauropteris of Binney and the Zygopteris Lacatti recently described by M. Renault,
he examined the Palmacites carbonigcmis of Corda, and which latter has generally
been regarded as a palm. The avithor rejected this view, and came to the conclu-
sion that the plant was a fern allied to the Marattiacere of the present day. In none
of the above plants was the slightest trace of the exogenous growth so common
amongst the Lycopods and Calamites to be found. But the author thought it pro-
bable that the Heterangimn Grievii, recently described by himself in a memoir
now being printed by the Royal Society, and in which a very feeble attempt at the
development of such a growth was observable, might prove to be a fern. But even
in that case the instance was such an isolated one, so far as our present knowledge
extends, and the growth was so feebly developed, that it merely appeared like one
of those exceptions which prove the rule. It only indicated the aJjsence in nature
of those sharply defined boundary lines which the systematist is ever seeking to
establish, but within which nature refuses to be restrained.

                                                               1. Mitraria.

   Only a single specimen was obtained of the little Mitraria which formed the
subject of the present communication ; and neither its structuie nor development was
made out as completely as could have been wished. From the Mediterranean species
described in a former communication (British Association Report for 1872), it differs

--in some points of structure and in the mode of annulation of the developing woim.

It possesses the usual Miiraria-iorm that of a hemispherical dome, having its
base encircled by a band of long vibratile cilia. In the side of the dome, a little
above the ciliated band, is the moiith, which leads into a rather wide pharynx
clothed with a ciliated epithelium. The pLnrynx runs through the dome parallel
to its base, and opens into a capacious stomach, which continues in the same direc-

tion until it joins the intestine. This then turns down abruptly at right angles to
the previous portion of the alimentary canal, and then projects for a short distance
beyond the base of the dome, caiTying with it, hernia-like, the walls of the base.

   The true body-walls of the future worm, of which the Mitraria is the larva, seem
as yet confined to the intestinal segment of the alimentary canal. They already
present the commencement of annulation, which, however, exists only on the
dorsal and ventral sides ; while two broad bands of very distinct fibres may be seen,
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  107

 one on tlie right and the other on the left side, extending transversely from the

 dorsal to the ventral surface.

    The ciliated band which runs round the base of the dome possesses a rather

--complex structure. It consists of two concentric rings an outer one composed of

 large, oral, distinctly nucleated cells ; and an inner one of a granular structure and
yellowish colour, in which no distinct cells could be demonstrated. The cilia form

--two concentric wreaths borne by the underside of the band an outer wreath con-

 sisting of very long cilia, and borne by the inner edge of the outer portion of the

band 5 and an inner wreath of much shorter cilia, borne by the inner edge of the
inner portion. The band, with its cilia, is inteiTupted for a very short space at the

aboral side of the dome. There is probably at this spot an entrance into a water-

vascular system. No such system, however, was observed in the specimen, though

the author had described in another species of Mitraria a system of sinuses which
appear to exist in the walls of the dome, and which he regarded as representing a

 water-vascular system (Brit. Assoc. Report for 1872).
    Occupying the very summit of the dome is a large, somewhat quadrilateral

ganglion, from which two distinct filaments are sent down, one on each side of the
alimentary canal ; but he was not able to follow these filaments to their destina-
tion. The bilateral symmetry of the ganglion suggests its formation out of two
lateral halves. Though its very superficial position gives it the appearance of
being a mere thickening of the walls, the view here taken of its being a nervous
ganglion seems to be the only one consistent with its relations to the surrounding

parts.

   On each side of the pharynx, a little behind the mouth, is a small oval ganglion-
like body, from which a filament runs to the ciliated band. Some delicate filaments
may also be seen lying between the pharynx and the walls of the dome on which
they seem to be distributed but the author could not trace them to any distinct

                                                                                                                    5

ganglionic centre.

   The great apical ganglion carries two very obvious black ocelliform spots, and,
besides these, two clear vesicles enclosing each a clear spherical corpuscle. The
two vesicles may probably be regarded as auditory capsules.

   The further development of this larval form has not been observed. It probably

consists chiefly in the continued prolongation of the alimentary canal bej'ond the
base of the hemispherical dome, the completion of the annulation by its extension

to the right and left sides, and the gradual contraction of the dome and final

absorption of the ciliated band.

                                                                      2. Toi'naria,

   Two specimens of the larval fonn originally discovered by Johann Miiller, and

described by him under the name of Tornariu, were obtained ; but these unfortu-
nately perished before a sufficiently exhaustive examination of them could be
made. On the whole, their structure agrees closely with what has been pointed
out by Alex. Agassiz, in his valuable and elaborate memoir on Tomaria and
liahnwglossus. The species appears to be different from those hitherto described.
The gills had not begun to show themselves, and there were but traces of the

" lappets " described in other species as appended to the posterior extremity of the

stomach.

   The author believed that he could distinguish a minute ganglion on each side of
the oesophagus ; filaments were sent off from it to the neighbouring parts, and the
two were connected to one another by a suboesophageal commissure. The water-
vascular chamber was very distinct, but the so-called heart was not observed
wliile within the body-cavity, lying close to the dorsal pore and over the canal by
which the great water-sac communicates with the external medium, was a small,
closed, rather thick-walled vesicle, containing numerous oval corpuscles. Of the

nature of this vesicle the author could not ofter any opinion.

   The cushion-like body which occupies the summit of the larva, exactly as in
Mitraria, and supports the two ocelliform spots, was very distinct ; and so also was
tlie contractile cliord which extends from this to the walls of the water-sac. The
author, however, could not here, any more than in Mitraria, regard the cusliion-like

body as a mere thickening of the walls : he believed it to be a nerve-mass, and
                                                                                                    8*
108 REPORT--1873.

thought he could trace two hue filaments proceeding from it and running down, one

towards the right and the other towards tlie left side of the alimentary canal ; but

he was not able to follow them for any distance, and he does not regard their

existence as confirmed. The extremely superficial situation of this body, which

makes it resemble a mere thickness of the walls, is paralleled by that of the great

ventral nerve-mass in Sayitta.

The contractile chord which runs to the water-sac is probably attached to a

capsular covering of the ganglion, rather than directly to the ganglion itself. This

chord, though showing strong contractions by wliich the summit of the larva is

drawn down towards the water-sac, is of a homogeneous structure, presenting no

appearance of distinct fibrillin or of other contractile elements.

WeThe author instituted a comparison between Tornaria and M'ttraria.  have

' in both the external transparent pyramidal or dome-shaped body, with a lateral

oral orifice and a basal anal orifice, enclosing an alimentary canal which is divisible

into three regions, and takes a partly horizontal and partly A'ertical direction in its

course from one orifice to the otlier*; we have in both, near the base of the body,

the circular band which carries loiig vibratile cilia, accompanied by a row of pig-

ment spots, and in both the cushion-like ganglion-carrying ocelli.

From Mitraria, Tornaria chiefly differs in the presence of the thick sinuous and

convoluted bands which give it so close a resemblance to certain Echinoderm

larvre, and which are entirely .absent from Mitrnria, and in its water-vascular

system, with the contractile cliord which extends from this to the apical ganglion.

If a water-vascular system is present in Mitraria, it consists thei-e of a system of

sinuses excavated in the walls of the dome, but without any representative of the

great central sac. In Mitraria the great apical ganglion carries not only the two

ocelli, but also two capsules, probably auditory; these capsules do not exist in

Tornaria. In Mitraria the two nerve-chords which the apical ganglion sends down

one on each side of the alimentary canal are very distinct ; in Tornaria, if they

exist at all, thej^ are by no means obvious. Finally, the ciliary circlet is simple in

Tornaria, wliile in Mitraria it is double.

According to Alexander Agassiz's account of the development of Tortiaria into

Bulanor/lossiis, the great transverse circlet of cilia becomes, by the elongation of the

body, gradually pushed baclcwards, so as to form the anal ciliated ring of the young
worm. In Mitraria the great ciliary circlet remains unchanged in position, and is

pi'obably ultimately absorbed, the worm during its development acquiring a new anal

wreath of cilia,

                             3. Ametrangia hemisjihcerica (uov. gen. et sp.).

   Among the most abundant products of the towing-net was a little hydroid

Medusa, remark.able for the want of symmetry in the distribution of its gastro-

vascular canals. It is of a hemispherical form, with the base about half an inch in
diameter, and provided with very numerous (more than 100) marginal tentacles,

which are very extensile, and may at one time be seen floating to a length of three

or four inches, and at another coiled into a close spiral against the margin of the

Umbrella. Each tentacle originates in a bulbous base with a distinct ocellus. No

lithocysts are visible on the margin. The velum is of moderate width.
   The maiiftTjriuni forms a small projection from the suunnit of the umbrella, and

terminates in four rather indistinct lips. From the base of the manubrium three

rather wide offsets are sent off at equal intervals into the walls of the umbrella.
These gradually contract in diameter, and then, as three narrow tubes of uniform
diameter, run towards the margin, where they open into the circular canal. The

Symmetry of the radiating canals is confined to these three primary trunks. From
their wide proximal ends each sends oft" branches, some of which may be traced to

the margin, where, lilce tlie three primary canals, they enter the circular canal ; while
others can be followed for various distances in the umbrella-walls, in which they
terminate by blind extremities without ever reaching the margin. These branches
are very irregular in the number sent off from each primary canal as well as in
their length and directions.

    The generative elements are formed iu oval sporosacs, developed cue on each of
the tliree primary canals at the spot where the wider base passes into its narrower
continuation. The ova may be seen within them iu various stages of development
they increase considerably in size before the commencement of segmentation, always
showing up to that period a large and distinct germinal vesicle with germinal spot,
and with a distinct nucleolus in the interior of the germinal spot. The development
of the ovum proceeds within the sporosac to the segmentation of the vitellus and
the formation of the planula, which now breaks through the outer walls of the
sporosac and remains for some time adhering to their external surface. The planula
differs remarkably from the typical hydroid planvda. It remains of a nearly sphe-
rical form, ne\ev acquiring cilia, and possesses little or no power of locomotion.
The gastric cavity, however, is fully formed. The author was imable to follow the

ova in their further development.

   The little jMedusa now described departs iu several important points from the
typical hydroid ^ledusa. From this it differs in the tei-nary disposition of the pri«
mary radiating canals, and iu the irregular non-symmetrical arrangement of those
which are subsequently formed. Among the very many specimens examined, the

author never found any in wliich the canals had become regular in their disposi-
tion, even in those which had discharged the contents of their sporosacs, and had
evidently attained the term of their existence. It diiiers also from the typical
Medusa in the form and non-ciliated condition of the planula ; and still further in
the fact tliat while the generative elements are borne on sporosacs, developed on
the radiating canals, the marginal bodies are ocelli and not lithocysts.

                                                  4. Circe inveiiens (nov. sp.).

   Among the hydroid Meduste captured in the towing-net were two or three spe-

cimens of a species referable to the genus Circe of Mertens. It measures about

half an inch in its vertical diameter and about a quarter of an inch transversely. It
is cylindrical from its base upwards for about two thu-ds of its height, and then
contracts abruptly and arches dome-like towards the truncated summit, which is

surmounted by a solid cone of the gelatinous umbrella substance. From the
summit of the umbrella-cavity, a solid somewhat fusiform extension of the roof
hangs down in the axis of its cavity for about two thirds of its depth, and at its free
end carries the manubrium, which extends nearly to the codonostome. The margin
of the umbrella carried eighty very short and but .slightly extensile tentacles, which
were connected at their bases by a very narrow membranous extension of the

margin, with rather irregular free edge. Lithocysts are situated at irregular
intervals upon the margin. There are about sixteen of them ; they consist each of
a minute spherical vesicle with a single large spherical concretion. There are no

ocelli. There is a moderatel}^ wide velum.
   The radiating canals are eight in number. They spring from the base of the

manubrium, run up tlie sides of the solid process which hangs from the summit of
the umbrella, pass from this to the walls of the umbrella, and then run down to-

wards the margin in order to open into the circular canal.
   The generative elements are borne in pendent sporosacs, which spring from the

radiating canals close to the summit of the umbrella-cavity.
   The motion of the Medusa takes place by means of sudden jerks, reminding us of

the way iu which certain Diphyidte dart through the water.
   The Medusa possesses also a very singular habit of partial inversion. This takes

place along the line which separates the dome-like poilion of the umbrella-cavity
from the lower cylindrical portion, and consists in the withdrawal of this dome-like
summit and the lower portion of the cavity. "When thus iuverted, the little animal
presents a drum-shaped form, with the manubrium hanging far out of the

codonostome.
    Alexander Agassi z considers the genus Circe of Mertens synonymous with

 Trachyncma, Gegenbaur, and points out that the name of Circe has been already
UHcd for a genus of MoUusca. He further removes it from among the_ true hydroid

MedusEe, and, regarding it as closely allied to the uE(iinid(e, places it along with

tliose in the HaplostomcBf Agassiz, a suborder of the Biscojihora.
--110 KEPORT 1873.

   The author, however, could not see sufficient grounds for the removal of Mertens's
genus from the true Hi/clroida, with which the Medusa now described agrees in all
essential points, including the form and disposition of the gastrovascular and
generative systems and the structure of the marginal lithocysts. Neither could he
aoree with Alexander Agassiz in identifying it with Trachi/iwma. The greatly
developed solid peduncle by which the manubrium in Circe is suspended frorn^ the
summit of the umbrella-cavity (in a way, however, which has its parallel in Tinia
among others), is of itself a character of generic importance by which Circe must be
kept apart from Trachynema. It is true that Gegenbaur's TracJti/nema has the
character of a young form ; and until we have further evidence of its adult state its

affinities cannot be regarded as established.
    Ge"-enbaur believes that he has established the direct development of Trachy-

wem«°from the egg without the intervention of a hydriform trophosome ; but

unfortunately we have no data by which to compare in this respect Circe with

Trachynema.
    It must be admitted, too, that in the imperfect contractility of the marginal ten-

tacles and in the somewhat greater firmness of the umbrella-walls the little medusa
described in the present communication possesses characters which look towards the
yEyinicke ; but these are by no means sufficiently strong to j ustify its separation from
the ordinary hydroid Medusae.

                                                               5. Tomopteris.

   A few young specimens of this beautiful little worm were obtained ; and the

author was enabled to confirm the statements of Grube and of Keferstein, who

describe in it a double ventral nerve-chord, though other observers have failed to
discover this part of the nervous system, and throw doubt upon its existence. In
 adult specimens examined some years previously by the author no ventral chord
 could be detected.

    The ventral portion of the nervous system consists of two flat ribbon-shaped
 chords, which are given oft' from the inferior side of the nerve-ring which sm-roimds
 the pharynx just behind the mouth. These run parallel to one another, separated
by a narrow interval ; they lie on the ventral walls of the animal, and may be
 traced through the narrow tail-like termination of the body as far as its extremity.
 They present no ganglionic swellings ; but opposite to every pair of feet each sends
 ofl" a filament which passes to the foot of its own side, in which it is distributed.

   Dr. Anton Dohm has just informed the author that he, too, has distinctly seen

 the ventral chord of Tomopteris.

        On the Fauna of Persia. By W. T. Blanford, F.G.S., C.M.Z.S.

     Persia being situated on the limit of the region occupied by the Palsearctic fauna,
  presents in dilferent parts of the country several peculiarities, in consequence of
 types belonging to the Indian and desert faunse being largely intermixed with each
 other, and with those peculiar to the Palsearctic province.

     In the extreme north the animals are identical with those of the neighbouring
 parts of Europe and Asia, the steppe fauna of Southern Russia being met with in
  the open parts of the country ; whilst the dense forests of the shores of the Caspian
  are chiefly inhabited by the same animals as occur in the woods of South-eastern
 Europe and Asia Slinor, mixed, however, with a few Asiatic types, as the tiger, the

 common pheasant, and a crotaline snake (Halys). Throughout the greater portion

  of the Persian territory the fauna is of the desert type, marked by the prevalence of
  such forms as Eqmis hemiunus, Gazella, Gerbillus, tlnfeo ferox, Gyps ftilvus, Buca-
  netes yithayineus, Pterocles, and Houhara, Eremias, Psammophis, Eryx, &c. ; whilst in
  the south the purely Palfearctic forms either disappear entirely, or are represented by
  winter migra,nt3 only, and several Indian fonns make their appearance, e. g. Gazella

Passer {Gijmnoris)Jlavicullis, P. indicm, Ortijgornis pondiceriana, Acanthodacti/lus

the Persian Gulf, tut they rarely occur above elevations of 3000 feet above the sea.

With the above are associated some animals hitherto only found in Baluchistan and

Sind, and a few forms previously only known from North-eastern Africa or Arabia.

The whole of Persia may thus be divided into three principal regions,--the forest

countries of Ghilan and Mazendaran on the Caspian, and probably the wooded slopes

on the eastern border of Mesopotamia, extending south to the neigbbourhood of Shi-

raz, the fauna of which is essentially European ; the plateau of Persia, wMch is

          Some BemarJcs on the, Mollusca of the Mediterranean.

                        By J. Gwr:sr Jeffreys, F.B.S.

After noticing the numerous writers on this subject, &om Aristotle to modern

authors, Mr. Jefli-eys remarked that the Mediterranean had long been debatable

ground with respect to the division of the European seas into zoological pro-

vinces. He referred to ' The Natural History of the Eiu'opean Seas,' by the late

Professor Edward Forbes and Mr. Godwin-Austen, and said that he agreed vrith

tlie latter in his view that the Mediterranean is " a vast lateral expansion
of the Atlantic," and not only in its physical aspects, but in most of its
natural-history productions ; and he believed that the missing links would sooner

or later be discovered. The newest and most complete list of the Testaceous
Mollusca of the Mediterranean is that by the Marquis de Monterosato, which

gives 758 species. Mr. Jefii-eys proposed to deduct 31 of these species for probable

varieties, and to add 39 species from the ' Porcupine ' and ' Shearwater' expe-
ditions, making altogether 766 Testaceous or shell-bearing species. The Nudi-

branchs and other naked or shell-less Mollusca described by Philippi (33 species),

as well as the Cephalopoda described and figured by Verany (43 species), being
added to the Testaceous species, there results a total number of 842 Mediterranean

species. Of these no less than 622 species inhabit also the North Atlantic, so that

only 222 species are at present supposed to be peculiar to the Mediterranean.

Lists of the 39 and 222 species are subjoined ; and the author fully expected that
most if not all of those in the latter category would be hereafter found in the

North Atlantic. According to the author's work on 'British Conchology,'_ there

are 562 species in our own seas, exclusive of those dredged beyond the line of
soundings in the ' Lightning ' and ' Porcupine ' expeditions.^ One of the most

interesting results of the ' Porcupine' expeditions consisted in the discovery at

considerable depths of living species of Mollusca which had been previously known

as fossils only and were regarded as extinct. Many of these species occm- in the newer

Tertiary beds of Sicily, and a list of them is likewise subjoined. The author said
                        all profess to study the great book of Nature. But before we
Wein conclusion :--"

study we must be able to read ; and who can say that he has read a single page,
much less a whole chapter, of this mysterious volume ? The sole knowledge we
possess of the deep-sea Mollusca of the Mediterranean (those which inhabit depths
mexceeding 500 fathoms) is derived from a few casts of the dredge made
                                                                                                                            the

' Porcupine ' expedition of 1870. The space thus partially explored was not much
larger than this room, while the area of the Mediterranean contains many hundred

thousands of square miles. Let us therefore compare the extent of om- researches

in this small nook or oftset of the Atlantic with that of the work yet to be under-
                                                                                                                            having made

                                                                                                                    ;

the comparison let us reflect, and then humbly confess our ignorance."
   In repljang to questions, Mr. Jeffreys said that the Suez Canal might hereafter

lead to an interchange of the Mollusca ; but he was not satisfied that more than

one species {Ringicida awiculata) was common to the Mediterranean and the

Red Sea.

taking naturalists. From the above sources of information we may get an idea of

the birds noticed in the West Biding within the recollection of living observers

and in present times.

  We may form an estimate of them thus. Taking the ' Zoologist's' List, compiled

--from Yarrell, of resident birds, migrants, and occasional visitants out of 29 raptorial

birds On that list, we have had 23 recorded ; of 1.35 insessorial birds, 91 ; of 13 raso-

rial birds, 10 have been recorded : thus of 177 generally designated Land Birds, we

have  had 124                                   of G4  grallatorial birds, 43                                                                                              of 90 natatorial birds, -57 have been re-
                                             ;                                                                                                                          ;

corded : thus of 154 wading or swimming birds we have a total of 100.

Another mode of showing the comparative numbers strikes us. Take the List in

Mr. Harting's excellent 'Ornithological Handbook of Besidents and Migrants,'

separated by him from the List of rare and accidental visitors to Great Britain,

--The species there enumerated are : of raptorial birds 20, of insessorial 105, of raso-
--rial 12, of grallatorial 64, of natatorial 90 making totals of land birds 137, of

water birds 124, totals of both divisions 261. Here is shown a greater proportion

for the West Riding, 224 (including a few on the List of rare or accidental visitors)

having been recorded out of the 201 considered as British birds. This is a large

number considering the wanton extermination to which many of the feathered

tribes are doomed. It shows the capabilities this Biding possesses to gratify the

field ornithologist, which would be greatly increased if half the care were taken in

preservingourpersecutedbirds, after the manner otWaterton and other landowneTS

following to some extent in his steps, as there is excess of zeal manifested to capture

or destroy every rare bird that visits or resides within the limits of this extensive

Biding. Our county presents great variety in physical formation, from the Pennine

range of Moimtain-limestone and Millstone-grit west, over the Coal-formation with

undulating slopes, valleys, streams, canals, pools, line woodlands, and noble parks,

over the Magnesian limestone to the Lias, Oolite, and Chalk cliffs of the East and

North Biding, which (though not within the limits to which this paper is confined)

afford suitable breeding-haunts and places of resort to many birds which frequently

favour the inland parts of Y'orkshire with their presence.

On a new Insect Iclovginr/ to tlic Family Eplictncriclae, vjith Notes on tlie
     Natural History of that Family. By E. MacLachlan, F.L.S.

  The author gave an account of a new species of the family recently received from

Canterburj', Kew Zealand, remarkable for its abdomen, which was very robust, and

the seventh to the ninth segments had broad, horny, acute, wing-like expansions

on each side, so that this part of the body resembled that of some Myriopod or

Crustacean. He proposed for it the name Oniscijjaster WalefieJdi, after its captor,

Mr. C. M. Wakefield. Although the earlier stages were unknown, he considered

it probable that the abdominal formation was reproduced in the imago ; and hence

Athe latter might be looked upon as a degraded form.                                                                                                                       somewhat analogous ab-

dominal structure was to be seen in the immature condition of the American

Batisca ohesn, as demonstrated by Walsh, though this latter possessed an enormous

tboracic development, forming a carapace under which the rudimentai-y wings were

concealed. And in connexion with this, the author alluded to the so-called

crustaceous genus Prosojnstoma of Latreille, which the French entomologists

MM. Joly, father and son, had recently asserted, with much appearance of truth,

indications of tracheal respiration in it.

                Address to the Department of Anatomy and Physiology.

                        By Professor EuTiusEyoRD, F.R.S.E.

   In addressing you upon the subjects of anatomy and physiology, I Avould invite
your attention to some of the features which characterize these departments of
biology at this present time, and to some recent advances in physiology, the con-
sideration of which you will find to be possessed of deep interest and importance.

                                                  State of Anatomy.

   Anatomy, dealing as it does merely with the structure of living things, is a far
simpler subject than physiology, whose province it is to ascertain and explain their
actions. It was not a difficult thing to handle such instruments as a knife and
forceps, and with their aid to ascertain the coarser structure of the body. Accord-

ingly, the naked-eye anatomy of man has been fully investigated ; and although the
same cannot be said of that of many of the lower animals, it is nevertheless, as far

as this kind of inquiry is concerned, a mere question of time as regards its comple-
tion. But minute or microscopic anatomy is in a different position. Requiring, as
it does, the microscope for its pursuit, it could not make satisfactory progress until

this insti'ument had been brought to some degree of perfection. Doubtless much

advantage is still to be derived from improvements in the construction of this
instrument ; but probably most of the future advances in our knowledge of the

structure of the tissues and organs of the body may be expected to result from the
application of new methods of preparing the tissues for examination with such
microscopes as we now have at our disposal. This expectation naturally arises from
what has been accomplished in this direction during the last fifteen years. For
example, what valuable information has been gained regarding the structure of
such soft tissues as the brain and spinal cord by hardening them with such an agent
as chromic acid, in order that these tissues may be cut into thin slices for micro-

scopical study. How greatly has the employment of such pigments as carmine,

aniline, and logwood facilitated the microscopical recognition of certain elements of

the tissues. What a deal we have learned regarding the structure of the capil-

laries and the origin of lymphatics by the eil'ect which nitrate of silver has of

rendering distinctly visible the outlines of epithelial cells. What signal service

chloride of gold has rendered in tracing the distribution of nerves by the property
which it possesses of staining nerve-fibrils, and thereby greatly facilitating their
recognition amidst the textures. Moreover of what value osmic acid has been in
enabling us to study the structure of the retina. In the hands of Lockhart Clarke,
Eecklinghausen, Cohnheim, Schultze, and others, these agents have furnished us

with information of infinite value ; and those who would advance microscopical
anatomy may do so most rapidly by working in the directions indicated by these
investigators. In human microscopical anatomy, indeed, there only remain for

--investigation things which are profoundly difficult such as, for example, the struc-

ture of the brain, the peripheral terminations of nerves, the development of nerve-
tissue, and other subjects equally recondite. But in the field of comparative

anatomy there is far greater scope for the histological investigator. He has only

to avail himself of those reagents and methods which have recently proved so useful
in the microscopical anatomy of the vertebrates ; he has only to apply those more
fully than has yet been done to the invertebrates, and he will scarcely fail to make
discoveries. For the lover of microscopical research there is, moreover, a wide field

--of inquiry in the study of comparative crabiyology that is to say, in the study of

the development of the lower animals. Since it has become clear that a Iniowledge
of the precise relations of living things one to another can only be ai'rived at by
watching the changes through which they pass in the course of "their development,
research has been vigorously turned in this direction ; and although an immense
mass of facts has long since been accumulated regarding this question, Parker's
brilliant researches on the development of the skull give an indication of the great

things which we may yet anticipate from this kind of research. Speaking of micro-

scopical study before this audience, I cannot but remember that in this country
more than in any other we have a number of learned gentlemen who, as amateurs,

eagerly pursue investigations in this department. I confess that 1 am always sorry

to'witness the enthusiastic perseverance with which they apply themselves to the
prolonged study of markings upon diatoms, important though these be in many
respects, seeing that they might direct their efforts to subjects which would repay
them for their labours far more gratefully. I would venture to suggest to such

workers that it is now more than ever necessary to abandon all aims at haphazard
discoveries, and to approach microscopy by the only legitimate method, of under-

going a thorough preliminary training in the various methods of microscopical

investigation by competent teachers, of whom there are now plenty throughout the

country.

State of Physiology.

With regard to physiology, the present standpoint is not so high as in the case
of anatomy. Physiology, resting as it does upon a ti-ipod consisting of anatomy,
physics or mechanics, and chemistry, is many-sided. The most minute anatomy,

the most recondite physics, and the most complex chemistry have all to be taken

into account in the study of the physiology of living things ; so that it is not sur-

prising that it should, in its development, lag behind the comparatively elementary

subject anatomy. Until not so very long ago anatomy and physiology were,_ in

most of our medical schools, taught by the same professor, who, although professing

to teach both subjects, was generally more of an anatomist than a physiologist.
This arrangement gave to physiology a bias which was eminently^ anatomical; and

this bias continued in many quarters, notwithstanding the separation of the physio-

looical from the anatomical tuition, I am aware that there are still some distin-
guished anatomists who intermingle physiological with anatomical teaching. I am

not questioning the usefulness of the practice when carried to a moderate extent.

I wish merely to point out what appears to me to have been a result of the practice,

and I believe that the result was to give to physiologj^ an anatomical tendency. It

was natiu-al for the anatomist who dealt with visible structure to constantly refer

to this in explaining physiological action or function. Tlie physiologist with the

anatomical tendency always tried to explain a difference in the action or function

of a part by a difference in its evident structure ; and when his microscope failed to

show any structural difi'erence between the cells which form saliva and those which

produce pancreatic fluid, between the egg of a rabbit and that of a dog, he, baffled

on the side of anatomy, was too ready to adopt the conclusion that, inasmuch as the

microscope i-eveals 7io diffcrmice in the structure, there is really no structural differ-

ence between them, and that the only way in which the difference in action can be

explained is by having recourse to the old hypothesis, that the metamorphoses of

matter .and the actions offeree are in the living world regulated by a metaphysical

entity termed a vital principle, and that dissimilar actions by similarly constructed

farts are only to be explained by referring them to the operations  of this  principle.

  After alluding further to the "hypothesis of the vital principle  and its  supposed

actions, and after stating that he did not follow the teaching of those who still

adhere to this doctrine, the author said that, viewed from the physical side, there

appears to be no reason for supposing that two particles of protoplasm, which pos-

sess a similar microscopic structure, must act in the same way ; for the physicist

knows that molecular structure and action are beyond the ken of the microscopist,

and that within apparently homogeneous jelly-like particles of protoplasm there

may be differences of molecular composition and arrangement which determine

widely different properties.]

  A gi-eat change is now taking place in physiological tuition in this country---a

superabundance of physiological anatomy and an almost entire absence of experi-

ment are no longer its characteristic features. Tlie study of physics, too much

neglected, is happily now being more and more regarded as important in the pre-

liminary training of the physiologist as the study of anatomy and of chemistry

and I trust that the day is not far distant when in our medical_ schools the thorough

education of our students in mathematics and physics will be insisted upon as abso-

siology will not advance in this country so rapidly as we could wish. I would not

in this place have alluded to a question concerning- medical education, but for the

fact that the progress of physiology will always greatly depend upon the education

of medical men ; for only those who are conversant with physics and chemistry, and
who, in addition, are acquainted with the phenomena of disease (that is to say with

abnormal physiological conditions) can handle physiology in all its branches. Phy-

siology owes not a little to a study of pathology--that is, of abnormal physiological

states. The study of a diseased condition has on several occasions given a clue to

the discovery of "the function of an organ. Nothing was known regarding the
function of the spleen until the pathologist observed that an increase in the number

of white corpuscles in the blood is commonly associated with an enlargement of

this organ. Hence arose the now accepted doctrine tliat the spleen is concerned in

the formation of blood-corpuscles. The key to our knowledge of the functions of

certain parts of the brain has also been supplied by a study of the diseased condi-

tions ot that organ. The very singular tact that the right side of the body is

governed by the left, and not by the right, side of the brain, was ascertained by

observing that palsy of the right side of the body is associated with certain diseased

conditions of the   left  side of the  brain                         that  the corpus striatum is concerned     in
                                                                  ;

motion, while the optic thalamus is concerned in sensation, and that intellectual

operations are manifested specially through the cerebral hemispheres, are conclusions

which were indicated by the study of diseased conditions. Moreover, by the pur-
suit of the same line of 'inquiry, the key has been given to the discovery of many
other facts regarding the brain functions. Some years ago M. Broca made the

remarkable observation that, when a certain portion in the front part of the left

side of the brain becomes disorganized by disease, the person loses the power of

expressing his thoughts by words, either spoken or written. He can comprehend

what is said to him, his organs of articulate speech are not paralyzed, and he
                                                                                                                but when
retains his  power  of writing,  for  he can  copy                   words  when  told  to  do  so
                                                                                                             ;

he is asked to give expression to his thoughts by speaking or by writing, or even

to tell his name, he is helpless. With a palsy of a portion of his brain, he has lost

his power of finding words; but although he has lost this power, his intelligent

perception of what passes around him and what is said to him is not lost. It is
true that this condition of aphasia, as it is termed, has been found to exist when

various parts of the brain have been diseased ; for example, it has been found to co-

exist with a diseased state of the posterior instead of the anterior part of the cere-

brum. This fact renders it very difficult as yet to assign a precise locality to the

myfaculty of speech. It is not, however,                             intention to discuss this question, for iny

object is merely to show how the studv of disease has given a clue to the physio-

logist. Broca's observation led to the" thought that, after all, the dreams of the

phrenologists would be realized, in so far as they supposed that the various mental

operations are made manifest through certain definite territories of the brain.

   It has until lately been supposed that the convolutions of tlie cerebruui are

entirely concerned in purely intellectual operations ; but this idea is now rendered

doubtful. It is probable, from recent researches, that in the cerebral convolutions

(that is, in the part of the brain which was believed to minister merely to intel-

lectual manifestations) there are nerve-centres for the production of voluntary

muscular movements in various parts of the body. It has always been taught that
the convolutions of the brain, unlike nerves in general, cannot be stimulated by

means of electricity. This, although true as regards the brains of pigeons, fowls,

and perhaps other birds, has been shown by Fritsch and Ilitzi^ to be untrue as

regards mammals. These observers removed the upper portion of the skull in the
dog, and stimulated small portions of the exposed surface of the cerebrum by means

of weak galvanic currents ; and they found that when they stiinulated certain

definite portions of the surfixce of the convolutions in the anterior part of the

cerebrum, movements are produced in certain definite groups of muscles on the

opposite side of the body. By this new method of exploring the functions of the

convolutions of the brain, these investigators showed that, in certain cerebral

convolutions, there are centres for the nerves presiding over the muscles ot

the neck, the extensor and adductor muscles of the forearm, for the flexor and ro-
tator muscles of the arm, the muscles of tlie foot, and those of the face. They,

moreover, removed the poi-tion of the convolution on the left side of the cerehrum,

which thej' had ascertained to be the centre for certain movements of the right fore

limb, and they found that after the injury thus inflicted, the animal had only an
imperfect control over the movements of the part of the limb in question. Re-

cently, Dr. Hughlings Jackson, from the observation of various diseased conditions

in -which peculiar movements occur in distinct groups of muscles, has adduced

evidence in support of the conclusion that in the cerebral convolutions are loca-

lized the centres for the production of various muscidar movements. Wilhin the

last few months these observations have been gi-eatly extended by the elaborate

experiments of my late pupil and assistant, and now able colleague in King's Col-

lege, Prof Ferrier.

Adopting the method of Fritsch and Hitzig (but instead of using galvanic he

has employed Faradaic electricity, with which, strange to say, the investigators

just mentioned obtained no very definite results), he has explored the brain in the

fish, frog, dog, cat, rabbit, and guineapig, and lately in the monkey. The results

of this investigation are of great importance. He has explored the convolutions of

the cerebrum far more fully than the German experimenters, and has investigated

the cerebellum, coi-pora quadrigemina, and several other portions of the brain not

touched upon by them. There is perhaps no pai't of the Drain whose function has

been more obscure than the cerebellum. l)r. Femer has discovered that this
ganglion is a great centre for the movements of the muscles of the eyeballs. He

has also very carefully mapped out in the dog, cat, &c. the various centres in the

convolutions of the cerebrum which are concerned in the production of movements

in the muscles of the eyelids, face, mouth, tongue, ear, neck, fore and hind feet,

and tail. He confirms the doctrine that the coi-pus striatum is concerned in

motion, while the optic thalamus is probably concerned in sensation, as ai-e also the

hippocampus major and its neighbouring convolutions. He has also found that in

--the case of the higher brain of the monkey there is what is not found in the dog or

eat to wit, a portion in the front part of the brain, whose stimulation produces

no muscular movement. What may be the function of this part, whether or not

it specially ministers to intellectual operations, remains to be seen. These re-

searches mark the commencement of a new era in our knowledge of brain fvmction.

Of all the studies in comparative physiology there will be none more interesting,

and few so important, as those in which the various centres will be mapped out in

Athe brains throughout the vertebrate series.  new, but this time a true, system

of phrenology will probably.be founded upon them; by this, however, I do not

mean that it will be possible to tell a man's faculties by the configuration of his

skull ; but merely this, that the various mental faculties will be assigned to definite

ten-itories of the brain, as Gall and Spurzheim long ago maintained, although their

geography of the brain was erroneous.

I have alluded to this subject, not only because it affords an illustration of the

service which a sthdy of diseased conditions has rendered to physiology, but also

because these investigations constitute the most important work which has been

accomplished in physiology for a very considerable time past.

                     Hevival of Physiology in JEnglamh

We may, I think, term this the renaissance period of English physiology. It

seems strange that the countiy of Han-ey, John Hunter, Charles Bell, Marshall

Hall, and John Reid should not always have been in the front rank as regards
physiology. The neglect of physics must be admitted as a cause of this ; it is also

to be attributed to the, until a few years ago, almost entire absence of experimental

teaching ; but it would be unjust not to attribute it, in gi'eat measure, to the limited

appliances possessed by our physiologists. It is to be remembered that physiology

could not be successfully cultivated without proper laboratories, with a supply of

expensive apparatus. "Without endowments from public or private resources, how

can such institutions be properly fitted up and maintained hymen who can, for the

most part, only turn to physiological research in moments snatched from the

busy toil of a profession so laborious as that of medicine ? In defiance of these diffi-

Aculties we are now striving to hold our place in the physiological world.  new

system of ph3-siological tuition is rapidly extending over tlie country. In the

London schools, in Edinburgh, Cambridge, Manchester, and elsewhere, earnest

etibrt3 are being made to give a thoroughly practical aspect to the tuition of our

science; and, notwithstanding the imperfect results which must necessarily ensue in

the absence of suitable endowment, we can nevertheless point to the fact that the

effect of these efibrts has been to awaken a love for physiological research in the
mind of many a student ; and the results of this awakening are akeady apparent in

the archives of the Iloj'al Societies, in the ' Journal of Anatomy and Physiology,'

and elsewhere. But physiological research is most expensive and laborious, and it

is, moreover, unremunerative. The labours of the physiologist are entirely philan-

thropic                          all  his  researches  do  nothing  but  contribute to  the increase  of human

happiness by the prevention of disease and the amelioration of suffering ; and I

would venture to suggest to those who are possessed of wealth and of a desire to

apply it for the benefit of society, that, in view of the wholly unselfish and philan-

thropic character of physiological labours, they coidd not do better than endow

laboratories for the prosecution of physiological research.

  We anticipate great benefit to the community not only fi-om an advance of

physiology, but from a difl'usion of a knowledge of its leading facts amongst the

people. This is now being carried out in our schools on a scale which is annually

increasing. Thanks to the eftorts of Huxley, the principles of physiology are now

presented in a singularly palatable form to the minds of the young. The instruc-

tion communicated does not consist of technical terms and numbers, but in the

elucidation of the principal events which happen within om- bodies, together with

an explanation of the treatment which they must receive in order to be maintained

in health. Considering how much may be accomplished by these bodies of ours if

the_y be properly attended to and rightly used, it seems to be a most desirable thing

that the possessor of the body should know something about its mechanism, not

--only because such knowledge affords him much material for suggestive thought not

only because it is excellent mental training to endeavour to imderstand the why and
--the wherefore of the bodily actions but also because he may greatly profit from a
Aknowledge of the conditions of health.
                                                                    thorough adoption of hygienic measm-es

(in other words, of measures which are necessary to preserve individuals in the highest

state of Iiealth) cannot be hoped for until a knowledge of fundamental physiological

principles finds its way into every family. This coimtry has taken the lead in the

attempt to diffuse a sound knowledge of physiological facts and principles among

the people, and we may fairly anticipate that this will contribute not a little to

enable her to maintain her high rank amongst nations ; for every step which ia

calculated to improve the physiological state of the individual must inevitably

contribute to make the nation successful in the general struggle for existence.

                            By AiFEED W. Bexnett, F.L.S,

   The glands which fringe the margin of the leaf and cover the upperside of the leaf
of Drosera have been shown by previous observers not to be hairs in the true sense
of the term, t. e. mere cellular expansions of the epidermis, but to be integi-al parts

of the leaf, with a fibro-vascular Dundle containing spiral threads (in other words,
'a vein or nerve of the leaf) running through them, and even to be furnished with

stomata. The glands excrete at all times, when in a healthy condition, a white
viscous gluten, which quickly entraps any small insect that settles upon the leaf,
gradually holding it down more and more as it struggles, till escape is hopeless. The
glands soon begin to move towards the imprisoned insect ; btit this movement is not
very conspicuous at first, and is very much more decided after the insect has almost

completely ceased to struggle, thus appearing not to be due to any "contractile tissue"
in the leaf which is irritnted by the movements of the insect. After the lapse of some
time the whole of tlie glands of the leaf, even those which are at a considerable

distance from the insect, are found to ba bending over towards it, and to be almost
in contact with it. After a time the insect is to all appearance digested, actually
supplying- the tissue of the leaf with nourishment. Very nearly the same effect
was produced by substituting for the fly a piece of raw meat, the movements
of the glands being somewhat slower, but ultimately almost as complete, the

meat being apparently digested in the same manner. On other leaves were
placed a minute piece of wood and a small piece of worsted ; and in neither of

these cases was the least change perceptible, after a considerable time, in the posi-
tion of the glands nor of the object itself.

Phi/siolor/ical Ri'secu-ches on thi Nature of Cholera. Bij Dr. LitroER Bruntox.

   The search after a true remedy for cholera, the author thought, had hitherto been
fruitless. Tlie cause of the disease was now generally admitted to be a poison of
some sort which could be transmitted from one person to another ; but there must

--also be a proper soil for the development of the poison in other words, the blood

and tissues must be in such a state that it can act upon them.

In the state of collapse there was constant vomiting and purging, and the intestinal

canal was speedily washed  clean  out, the  stools consisting of the  secretion alone
                                                                                                                                                         ;

the blood stagnated in the great veins of the thorax and abdomen, and left the skin

shrunken, pale, and cold, the interior of the body being hotter even than in a state of

liigh fever. That blood which filled the small cutaneous veins being no longer

driven forward by fresh supplies from the arteries, became completely deoxidized
and black, imparting to the surface a livid hue. It still retained its power to take up

oxygen and give olf carbonic acid ; but, notwithstanding this, it passed so slowly

through the pulmonary vessels that only about one third of the usual quantity of

carbonic acid was given oft' from the lungs ; and little oxygen being taken in, there

was a distressing feeling of want of breath. At the same time the voice was hoarse,

low, and weak ; but this seemed to be simply a consequence of the general exhaus-

tion of the patient.

The symptoms of cholera all arose from disturbance of the circulation .and altera-

tion of the intestinal secretion ; and it might be thought that the only means of re-
moving those conditions would be to eliminate from the body that poison which was

producing these effects, and that so long as it was still circulating in the blood,

any remedy which was simply intended to counteract it would be administered
in vain. Eut the researches of Fraser and others on antagonism had shown that

the elimination of a poison was not required in order to prevent its injurious or fatal

action the administration of an antidote would deprive it of its hurtful power ; and
                                    ;

as it was with other poisons so might it be with that of cholera. It occurred to Dr.

Brunton that if any poison should possess actions similar to those of cholera-poison,

an antidote to it might possibly pro^e to be a remedy for cholera. He therefoi-e

began to look for a drug which woidd produce the same chancres in the circulation

which occurred in cholera. These were, he believed, first attributed by Dr. Parkes

to spasmodic contraction of tlie pulmonary vessels, which prevented the blood from

passing through them ; and this opinion had found a warm supporter in Dr. George

Johnson. Most of the symptoms, though not all, could be explained on this

hj-pothesis.

    Professor Schmiedebevg, in investigating the physiological action of a poisonous

mushroom the (Ainaiiifd muscaria or Af/aricus viuscarius), noticed that when

given to animals it caused great dyspnoea, and at the same time the arteries became

--empty, so that when cut across hardly a drop of blood issued from them the very

condition which existed in cholera. Administering atropia to the warm-blooded

animals suffering from these symptoms, Professor Schmiedeberg found that they at
once recovered. lie had not thought at all, however, of contraction of the pulmo-

nary vessels as a cause of dyspnoea. He attributed it rather to excitement of the

nervous centre in the paeduUa oblongata, which regulates the respiratory move-
                                 TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                             125

ments                            but as the effect of atropia itself is to excite  the nervous ceutre, it  ought,
                              ;

according to his supposition, to have increased instead of removing the hreathlessness.

When the idea that the dyspncea was due to contraction of the puhnonary capil-

laries suggested itself to Ur. Brunton, he proceeded to test it by experiment.

He first gave a rabbit such a dose of chloral hydrate as to deprive it of all sensibi-

lity, then put a tube into the windpipe and connected it with a pair of bellows. lie
was thus able to inflate the animal's lungs at regular inter^als nnd keep up respira-

tion artificially when the animal could no longer breathe itself. He next opened
the thoracic cavity so as to observe the slightest change in the lungs or heart. He

injected a little niuscarin into the jugular vein, when the lungs which had been pr^-
viously rosy became blanched, the right side of the heart swelled up, the veins

passing to it became enormously distended, and the left side of the heart almost
empty. Shortly afterwards he injected a little atropia into the jugular vein. At
once the effects of the muscarin disappeared, and every thing assumed its normal

appearance. From the want of muscarin he had not pursued his investigations, but

hoped shortly to do so.

   Hitherto he had proceeded on the assumption that Drs. Parkcs's and Johnson'.s
theory of cholera was correct, and that the stoppage of the circulation in cholera was
due to contractions of the arterioles of the lungs, as it was iir muscarin-poisoning. In

poisoning by muscarin the great veins of the thorax and abdomen and the right side

of the heart seemed to be almost equally distended, and exactly the same condition

was found in persons who had died of cholera. But it was not certain that the right

side of the heart was always so much distended during life, even when the symptoms
of cholera were present in their most pronoimced form. It would almost seem that
the veins dilated still more in cholera-collapse than they did in muscarin-poisoning.

Nitrite of amyl has the power of dilating the arterioles throughout the body, and iu
those of the lungs also ; but it was found practically to be of no use in cholera. The
pulse might become a little stronger and the surface a little warmer, but the improve-
nient was so slight tliat it is hardly worth mentioning, and the patient felt no better

for the medicine either when inhaled or when injected subcutaneously. If the weak-

ness of the pulse depended only on contraction of the vessels in the lungs, this result
would be astonishing ; but if they supposed it to be caused by dilatation of the great

veins, it was just what they would expect. From these and other facts. Dr. Brunton

concluded that the veins were dilated, and that therefore some remedy must be em-

ployed which would make them contract. Tliere were very few experiments on

the contractility of the veins ; but in the condition of depression or shock following

severe injuries, in which the veins were much dilated, digitalis had been found

useful, and it might prove useful in cholera also. Atropia had been lately tried in

cholera by an American practitioner with considerable success, and it seemed

deserving of a more extensive trial.

It would not do, however, to consider the action of any proposed remedy for

cholera on the circulation alone, and to leave out of account its effect upon the in-

testinal secretion. He therefore set to work to discover the action of atropia upon

the intestinal secretion. Since the effect of cholera upon the intestine was the same

as that of division of its nerves, which was one cause of secretion, tliey were justified

in believing that if any drug could stop the secretion in Moreau's experiment of

dividing the intestinal nerves it was likely to have a similar effect on cholera.

Now atropia had remarkable power to stop secretion from the salivating and sweat

glands when their nerves are irritated, rendering the mouth and slcin quite drj'.

"What its effect on paralytic secretion in the salivating glands might be he did not

know ; but thinking that it might arrest the flow of fluid into the intestine, he

repeated Moreau's experiment and injected some solution of atropia into the vein

of the animal. On killing it some hours afterwards, he found that there was fluid

iu that part of the intestine the nerves of which had been divided. The

dose, however, was not large ; and he comforted himself with the hope that a large

dose might do, though a small one would not. He afterwards tested the power of

atropia to check the secretion induced by injection of sulphate of magnesia into the

intestine, both by injecting a mixture of sulphate of magnesia and atropia into the

intestine and by injecting sulphate of magnesia alone into the bowel, and a solution

of atropia into the veins. In both cases he used very large doses of atropia, but
--126 REPORT 1873.

they had not the slightest eftect upon the secretion. The result was disappointing,
and rendered the use of atropia in cholera somewhat doubtful. It was, however,
difficult to foretell the eflfect of any drug under particular circumstances, and he

should therefore continue his experiments.

   The points to which he wished to direct particular attention were these :
    (1 ) That, assuming Parkes's and Johnson's theory to be correct, and the impeded
circulation in cholera to be due to obstruction in tlie pulmonary vessels, atropia waa
likely to prove beneficial to a certain extent ; and since it had been empuically
found to be usefid in the disease, it ought to receive a fair trial at the hands of the

medical profession.

    (2) The fact that the right side of the heart was not dilated during life in cholera
patients, as well as the uselessness of nitrite of amyl, which dilated the pulmonary
vessels, showed that Parkes's and Johnson's theory was imperfect, and that one of
the most important pathological conditions in cholera-collapse consisted in an

active dilatation of the thoracic and abdominal veins. Any remedy, to be usefid

in cholera, must have the power of counteracting this condition ; and the adminis-
tration of digitalis in cholera-coUapse might be useful.

   (3) The profuse secretion from the bowels in cholera was due to paralysis of some
of the intestinal nerves j and a remedy which will ai-rest it was still a desideratum.

     The Localization of Function in the Brain. By David Ferkiee, M.D.,

                Professor of Forensic Medicine, Kinfs Colleye, London.

    In his paper on this subject, Dr. Ferrier alluded to the various theories at present

--held in regard to the possibility of localizing specific functions in definite regions

of the brain mentioning especially the various facts of disease, such as extensive
abscesses, which appear to negative the idea of localization; and, on the other hand,
those in favour of localization, such as the facts of aphasia, and the peculiar localized
and unilateral epileptic and clonic spasms, which the researches of Hughlings
Jackson seemed to connect with irritation of definite regions of the brain-centre.

    The great difficulty had hitherto l:>een the want of a method which would lead to
positive results, instead of the usual negative phenomena resulting from the ordi-
nary methods of investigating the functions of the brain by means of mechanical or
similar destruction of the brain-substance. The researches of Fritsch and Hitzig
and the theory of discharging lesions, advocated by Hughlings Jackson as the
cause of the different epilepsies, formed the starting-point of the investigations which
Dr. Ferrier communicated to the Association.

    The results at which he ai-rived, from experimentation on the brains of rabbits,
cats, and dogs, have already been partly published in the West-Riding Lunatic
Asylum Report for 1873 ; but the experiments on monkeys and other animals, which
were likewise brought before the Association, as well as the further elucidation of
the experiments already published in the West-Riding Reports, are reserved for
the Royal Society, under whose auspices the late experiments have been con-
ducted. The following was the general scope of the paper The author, after a
general sketch of the surface and convolutions of the brain in animals experimented

 on, pointed out on a series of diagrams the centres in the different convolutions,

   The homologous parts were pointed out in the braius of the rat, guiueapig,
rabbit, cat, dog, jackal, and monke}', and indicated in the human brain according to
the convolutional homology existing between it and the simian brain.

   In particular the complex movements of the hands and feet were described,
and the situation of the centres of these yaiious movements definitely localized.
In addition to these centres for movements, which the author described as

evidently volitional, purposive, or expressive, other regions of the brain, the

posterior, were pointed out as probably the cerebral centres in connexion with some

of the special senses, such as sight, hearing, and smeU. On the same plan as before,
the homologous parts and convolutions were indicated in the human brain.

Certain anterior regions at the frontal exti'emity of the cerebral hemispheres in

the monkey, and also the posterior or occipital lobes of the monlcey's brain, yielded

no results which could yet be laid hold of.

  A comparison was instituted between the corresponding parts in the brains of

the lower animals and of man, and some speculations were oft'ered as to the sig-

nification of the development of these parts in their relation to intelligence.

   Several facts in relation to combined expressional movements, such as the mouth

and hand, were sho^vn to be dependent on the close cerebral relation of the centres for

these movements, with powerful stimulation, one gradually radiating into the other.
   The key to the psychological aspect of the facts presented by the experiment was

indicated to be the condition of aphasia, which is usually found associated with

disease of the posterior part of the inferior frontal convolution on the left side.
   This region Dr. Ferrier showed, in the brain of the monkey, to be that part which

governed the movements concerned in articulation ; and the homology was also
pointed out in the brains of the cat, dog, jackal, and other animals. Stimulation

of this region in cats and dogs frequently elicited vocal speech in the form of

memng and barkiiig ; and it Avas the homologue of this part in the brain of man,

disease of which was followed by the loss of articulate speech and the memory

of words.

   The two hemispheres of the brain, however, were shown to be symmetrical ; and,
in regard to the mouth, the action of the brain was also bilateral, and not, as usually

the case, crossed and unilateral.
   The explanation adopted was that the loss of the power of voluntarily recalling

words was due to the fact of the left hemisphere being the leading side, just as in
most people the right hand is most commonly used. The loss of speech was there-

fore due to the inability of the other side of the brain all at once to get at the

proper word, even though they existed, as shown by the fact that the individual

can recognize the word when mentioned.

The results of experiments on the hemispheres and optic lobes of fishes, frogs,

and birds were also alluded to, but not entered into fully. The corpora striata were

shown to be motor, and the optic thalami evidently sensory.

   The cerebellum wa.s shown to have a function not hitherto allotted to it, viz. the

coordination of the ocular muscles. In the rabbit the various lobules were
described as moving the eyes in different directions ; and similiu' experiments
with similar results had been obtained in the case of cats, dogs, and monkeys.

   The relation of the cerebellum as an oculo-motorial and general equilibrium
coordinating centre was slightly discussed, and their mutual interdependence

indicated.

   These latter subjects, however, are imder investigation, as well as many other

points in connexion with the ceretiral hemispheres, and therefore the author con-

tented himself with only a general sketch of the results.

        Heart and Brain. By J. Milxee Eothergiil, M.D., M.B.C.P.

   The qualities of endurance are rather cardiac than cerebral. Ability and deter-
mination bear no relation to eacli other ; but the expressions " faint-hearted " and

" stout-hearted " fall in with some of our most modern physiological views. When

the blood-pressure on the brain is too great and the roots of the vagus (the restraining
--128 REPORT 1873.

nerve) are flooded with blood, the inhibitory fibres ai'e thro'W'n into action and the

heart's contractions lowered. In hypertrophy of the heart the OTerjrroNvn organ is not

so readily reined in , and so apoplexj^ is commonly found along with this heart-change.

In otlier cases, again, the blood-supply of the brain is defective, and then the brain is

crippled. This was well seen in the case of a youth with congenital heart-disease,

who came under the writer's notice, where the horizontal posture, so as to fill the

head with blood, was necessary in order that the youth niiglit learn or repeat his

pieces of poetry. In medical practice the intimate association of heart and brain

is well known, and in a large proportion of the cases of insanity distinct changes

in the circulatory system are found. Where there is great cerebral hyperemia, the

ordeal bean of Calabar, which stimulates the inhibitory fibres of the vagus, and so

holds back the heart, is found to be the most efic;ctive agent in controlling the

violent mania of high cerebral vascularity. On the other hand, in cases of heart-

disease the character commonly becomes altered, the resolute person becoming

A'acillating and capricious, the even-tempered person growing irritable and sus-

picious. The effect of heart-disease on character is well seen in old Peter

Featherstone  in  ISIiddlemarch                                                      and the vacillation of that obstinate old man

betwixt his two wills shows how the brain halts and lacks its wonted determination

when its arterial blood-supply is defective. The sensations of a patient in the

great hospital of Vienna, whose heart stood still at intervals from the pressure of a

tumour on the inhibitory nerve (the vagus), were described. Such is a part of the

negative evidence of the relation of heart and brain; for tlie positive evidence we

must turn to the records of the sporting world. Eclipse, the famous racer, and

Master Magratli, the noted courser, two animals reno^vned for their tremendous

endurance even more than for their speed, were both examined after death to see if

any thing could l^e found to explain their peculiar prowess. In each an unusually

large heart was   found                               and  to                        this  were  attributed, and  rightly so, their  extra-

ordinary ])owers. "We may say, then, without hesitation, that a brain can no more

give out efficient manifestations of force without a sufficient blood-supply, than an

army can fight or mancBuvre effectively without a proper commissariat, or aa

engine work up to its full power without a liberal supply of coal and water.
Finally, we may conclude that the waves of nerve-force, which resolve themselves

into either psychical resolution or sustained muscular effort, are dependent in their

turn upon a well-maiutained succession of blood-waves supplied hj a firm and

vigorous heart.

On the PJiysioloffical Action of Crystalline Aconitia and pseudo-Aconitiu.
                                Bij Dr. TnoMAs E. Fraser.

The experiments were made with the nitrates of crystalline aconitia and pseudo-

aconitia, prepared by Mr. Groves, F.C.S., who first separated aconitia in a crystal-

line form in I8C4. Both alkaloids powerfully influence the cardiac contractions

and respiratory movements. Their toxic power is very great, entitling them

Aprobably to be regarded as the most active poisons as yet known.                                                 very re-

markable and exceptional difference of toxicity for different species of animals was

found to exist ; for while aconitia \& for frogs about five times more powerful as a

toxic agent than pseudo-aconitia, the latter substance is for rabbits about twice as

powerfid as the former. It was ascertained that this difference depends on aconitia

possessing a more energetic action on the heart, and a less eneigetic action on the

respiratory movements, than pseudo-aconitia.

  The condition of the laiynx and other vocal organs in persons who have reached
the age of ICO years is of especial interest when determined during life, and
presented some new facts necessitating a modification of the views generally enter-

one occasion, the results Avere satisfactor}', and less difficulty was experienced than

was at tirst anticipated. The thyroid cartilage was more distinctly prominent in

the two males than the females ; in all nine it -was freely movable, and not hard

and unyielding, as is sometimes seen in persons of the ago of 60 and 70.

On slight compression there "was a resiliency that pointed to cartilaginous llexi-

bility, and lateral movements gave the sensation of cartilage gliding upon car-

tilage, showing absence of calcareous transformation in the articulating surfiices.

The hyoid hone, readily felt in all, gave no enlargement or other alteration of the

thyro-hyoid ligaments                                                                                                          nor -were  the  pulsations  of the  carotids                                                                unduh'   felt,  as

The cjv'coiVZ cartilage on rotation gave the cartilaginous gliding already mentioned,

and the rings of the trachea were compressible in any direction.

The laryngeal mirror had to be used with expedition, and revealed a vertical

towards the tip and sides, aiibrding a ready view of the interior of the larj'nx.

The vocal cords mostly formed a triangular glottis ; they were longer in the males

and in one of the females than in the others, whilst their colour in the latter was

mostly of a greyish white : in one of the males it was yellow. The voice varied,

being mostly smooth, soft, clear, and melodious ; in the "female with the long cords

it was louder and more masculine than in the others, and so was it in one of the

males, being at the same time somewhat cracked in tone. The chest capacity was

fairly good in all, and the breathing of the most healthy character ; the cartilages

of the ribs were not ossified in any, for the movement of the ribs and their car-

tilages was wholly unimpeded, thus resembling persons of 25 or 30. Every organ

in the body was normal, and the special senses as a rule were perfect. The con-

clusions arrived at were that there was an absence of these changes that are usuallv

looked upon as senile, such as calcification of the laryngeal cartilages or of the

coats of the blood-vessels, and ossification of the                                                                                                        costal cartilages                                                               and  as  all    the

persons over 95, or who reach the age of 100 years, must henceforth be considered

to be free from such changes as are believed usually to bring life to a close between

70 and 80. As relates, however, to the epiglottis, its vertical position (the normal

one) is common to all persons over the age of 70, as the author's researches have

proved in an examination of 5000 healthy persons of both sexes and all ages ; but
the perfection of the cartilage is to be seen in centenarians.

White Coriiusdes, their Nature and Origin in the Animal Organism.

                              By Dr. J. Goodmas^.

In the prosecution of his experiments upon the development of fibrin by the

action of water upon albuminous substance, the author discovered that sometimes

instead of fibrin thousands of corpuscles presented themselves *.

The development of corpuscles was ultimately discovered to be the result of the

employment of old eggs or of long-drawn serum, or, in other M'ords, of albumen of

low vital power, that from fresh albumen developing fibrin, that from old albumen

Acorpuscles.  low temperature just above the freezing-point, even with fresh

eggs, produced the same effect, and the substance thus formed was of lighter spe-

cific gravity than that which developed fibrin.

The exterior of the substance produced was discovered to form, generallv under

the influence of cold, a coating of a dark and coaguluni-liko material, sometimes

enclosing well-formed fibrin, which, seen under the microscope bv the reflected

solar ray, was found to be constituted entirely of coi-puscles. Thus corpuscles

were seen to be produced in like manner with fibrin. When separate these little

bodies always evinced a tendency to coalesce and unite together, and, like fibrin,

thus to manifest a force of attraction, particle for particle, but in a minor degree.

This power was greater or less in proportion to the degree of vital energy of the

albumen employed.

Sections, 1870, p. 139, and 1871, p. 72.
130 E13P0RT--1873.

It was also proved, by frequently repeated experiment, tliat corpuscles by

coalescing and uniting together develop librinous rods and other structures of this

material. The substance thus formed, when subjected to compression between

two plates of glass under the microscope, actuall}' had its cohesive power over-

come, and became resolved  into  corpuscles                                                  and when  the  pressm-e was  removed
                                                                                          ;

sometimes these again united, and developed filjrinous rods and other structures.

Moreover corpuscles were the last products witnessed duriug the decomposition and

disintegration of librin.

It was therefore rendered evident that corpuscles are identical in their nature

with fibrinous substance, corpuscles and Hbrin being mutually convertible into

each other.

   These two great coagulable and structm-e-forming components of the blood are

--thus seen to derive their origin from like substances, conditions, and agencies viz.

the subjection of albuminous material to the agency of water, both which ingre-

dients are discovered in abundance in tlie lacteals and absorbents of the body.

   As shown b}' some of our most eminent physiologists, excess of hbrin or of
corpuscles in the human frame indicates a healthy or morbid state of the organism

--the preponderance of fibrin being held by them as the symbol of the highest con-

ditiou of health, whilst the predominance of corpuscles is equally maintained as

indicative of a cachectic or otherwise unhealthy state of body ; so in these experi-

ments the corroborative voice of Nature declares that a liigh state of vitality in the

albumen is associated with the development of librin, whilst a low vital energy in

the substauce employed has always a tendency to produce corpuscular products.

                        Oil the Mode of Formation of Renal Calculi.

                    By George Haiiley, M.D., F.R.S., F.B.C.P.

   In tills communicatiou the author laid down several general laws as beiug
a])plicable to all kinds of calculi, a few of which are the foUov/iug :

   1st. Calculi may occur at every period of lite from the cradle to the grave.
   2nd. In all cases of constitutional concretions the amount of renal solids must

be disproportionate to the amount of liquids excreted.
   3rd. Tluit the deposition of a calculus iu any part of the renal system is in every

case due to some special local cause. Tlie cause may be trifling and temporary;

but still it must exist. Once, however, the concretion has begun to form the
original exciting cause is soon lost sight of, and the calculus goes on forming
round its nucleus, quite independent of the local condition which called it into

existence.

   4th. The vast majority of constitutional calculi, be their nature what it may

(oxalate of lime, phosphate of lime, uric acid, xauthin, or cystin), have their origin

in the Iridueys.

   oth. The colour of the concretion does not always depend upon the nature of
the substauce whicli is composed, but upon the presence of other colouring-matters

in the renal secretion. Uric acid calculi, for example, vary iu depth of colour
according as the quantity of urohtematin is small or great just as crystals of sugar-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

candy owe their pink, yellow, or other tints to the pigment present in the water
out of which they are crystallized. Phosphatic and cystmic calculi form an
exception to this rule by refusing to combine with extraneous pigments.

   6th. There are three perfectly distinct modes in which crystalloid material

is deposited iu the formation of calculi.

   The fii'st aud rarest form of calculi are those which consist of a monster crystal,
or an aggregation of monster crystals, aud are only to be met with iu the case of
triple phosphates, oxalate of lime, and uric acid. The second is that in whicli a
certain amount of colloid is xmited with the crystalloid material ; one iu which
it may be said that small ciystals separating from the supersaturated renal
secretion become entangled in mucus, tube casts, epithelium scales, or other colloid
material, and by fresh aggregations around them gradually become closer aud closer
packed together, until they assume the appearance aud properties of a compact
concretion. The last mode of formation is by the aggregation of moleculai- atoms,

Oil tlie priuciple of molecular coalescence from the uuiou of viscid or colloid material

witli earthy or organic crystalloid matter, in the maimer of the formation of the

dental tissues and shell-structures described by Mr. George Rainey.

 To    these  three different  modes of  constitutional  calculus formation                           the  author

_

gives the respective names of Crystalline, Ciystallo-coUoid, and Molecular coales-

cence. In concluding, the author remarked that the calculi he had been describing

must not be confounded with those which, for the sake of distinction, might bo
termed " accidentally acquired," such as vesical, which frequently have for their

nucleus foreign substances, such as a pea, a barleycorn, a piece of bone, hair, wire,

a fragment of sealing-wax, or a portion of catheter, the irritation of which excites

the presence of tenacious mucus, blood, or even pus, with which the foreign body

itself becomes coated, and in and around which crystalloid molecules and actual

crystals are deposited and form the calculus.

Lastly. Calculi are not always of uniform composition throughout. Their com-

position varies at different times with the different states of health of the patient.

The centre of the concretion may be composed of uric acid, then may come a layer

of oxalate of lime, and over that another layer of uric acid or of phosphate, so that

in a section of a calculus the clinical phases through which a patient has past may

be read as truthfully as the geologist can read the earth's history in the strata

forming its crust.

0)1 the Structure of the Egr/, and the early Development of the Oephahpod

      Loligo. By E. Eat Lankesteh, M.A., Exder College, Oxford.

The author discussed some points as to the nature and mode of formation of

eggs, in connexion %vith his observations on the &g^ of the cuttlehsh, Loliyo.
Every egg is originally a small corpuscle of protoplasm, like those which btuldup

the tissues of animals ; but it acquires additional substance, and in some animals

(for instance, birds) becomes very large before it is laid. The additional substance

differs in its character in different animals. In Apus fom- original egg-corpuscles

fuse and form one egg, from which one embryo develops. In most cases the eoo*

grows  in  the  ovary by receiving nutrition from  the blood                                  but in  many cases  (In
                                                                                           ;

birds, fishes, and in cuttlefish) the egg is contained in a capsule, which is lined

with living corpuscles, and these are continually multiplying by division, and

pass from the capside into the e^^^ to increase its bulk. "Tliis Mi\ Laukester had

demonstrated by sections in the case oi Loliyo. So far he agreed with Prof. His;

but he did not find that these corpuscles remained alive and helped to form the

embryo cuttle fish. The egg of Loligo when laid was a perfectly homogeneous

mixture of albuminous matters of («) the original egg-corpuscle, {h) the corpuscles

from the capsule, and (c) the male spermatozoa. From this mixture there segre-

gated at first to one pole plastic matter, which broke up into corpuscles (" klasto-

plasts ") forming a cap (yelk-cleavage). Outside this cap of cleavage-corpuscles

other large corpuscles (" autoplasts ") then made their appearance by a new and

independent process of segregation (free cell-formation) ; and these became branched,

forming a deep or middle layer in the embryo, whilst the cleavage-corpuscles spread

over them at a hi'gO*her level.

Note on Huizinga's Experiments on Ahiogenesis. By Dr. Burdon Sandebsox.

   Under the title of a " Contribution to the question of Abiogenesis," Prof.
Huizinga has very recently published (Pfliiger's Archiv, vol. vii. p. 649) a series of
experiments which deserve notice, as conslituting a new and carefully worked out

attempt to support the doctrine of spontaneous generation.

   Prof. Huizinga begins his paper with the words " Multa reuascentur quae jam
cecidere," using them as an expression of the recm-ring nature of this question.

He then proceeds to say that he was induced to undertake his inquiry by the
publication of the well-known work by Dr.- Bastian (whom ho compliments as
--133 REPORT 1873.

lia^iiig' awakened the exhausted interest of physiologists in tlie subject), his special

object being to repeat the niuch-discussed tuvnip-cheese experiment.

Every one knows what Dr. Bastian's observation is. It is simply this, viz. that

if a glass flask is charged witli a slightly alkaline infusion of turnip of sp. gr. 1015,

to which a trace of cheese has been added, and is then subjected to ebullition for

ten minutes and closed hermetically while boiling, and finally kept at fermentation

temperature, Bacteria develop in it" in the course of a few days. This experiment

has been repeated by Iluizinga Avith great care, and the accuracy of Dr. Bastian's

statement of fact confirmed by him in every particular ; yet, notwithstanding this,

he thinks that the evidence aflbrded by the"se results in support of the doctrine so

inadequate, that be, desiring to find such evidence, has thought it necessary to

repeat the observation under what he regards as conditions of greater exactitude.
   Huizinga's objections to Bastian's experiment are two. First, that when a flask

is boiled and closed hermetically in ebullition, its contents are almost entirely
deprived of air ; and, secondly, that cheese is a substance of mixed and uncertain

composition. To obviate the "first of these objections he closes his flasks, after ten
minutes' boiling, not by hermetically seahug them, but by placing over the mouth

of each, while in ebullition, a porous porcelain plate which has first been removed
from the flame of a Bunsen's lamp. The hot porcelain plate is made to adhere to

the edge or lip of the flask by a layer of asphalt, with which the edge has been

previously covered. The purpose of this arrangement is to allow air to enter the

flask at the same time that all germinal matter is excluded. It is not necessary to

discuss whether this is so or not.

To  obviate  the  second  objection  he  alters the  composition of  the liquid used
                                                                                                                                    ;

he substitutes for cheese, peptone ; and for turnip-infusion, a mixture of the fol-

lowing composition in 1000 parts :--

                  Grape-sugar            ....        25 grammes.
                  Potassium nitrate
                                                      2,,
                  Magnesium sulphate                   2,,
                  Calcium phosphate                   0-4 gramme.

The phosphate is prepared by precipitating a solution of calcium chloride with

ordinary sodium phosphate, taking care that tlie chloride is in excess. The preci-

pitate of neutral phosphate so obtained is washed and then added to the saline

solution in the proportion given. On boiling it is converted into soluble acid

phosphate  and insoluble basic salt, of  which  the  latter is removed by infiltration
                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

consequently the proportion of phosphate in solution is less than that above indi-

cated. To the filtrate, peptone is added in the proportion of 0-4 per cent.

The peptone is obtained by digesting egg-albumen at the temperature of the

body in artificial gastric juice, made by adding the proper quantity of glycerine

extract of pepsin to water acididated with hydrochloric acid. The liquid so ob-

tained is first rendered alkaline by the addition of liquor sodfe, then slightly

acidulated with acetic acid and boiled. The syntonin thus precipitated is sepa-

rated by infiltration from the clear liquid, which is then evaporated to a sirup and

pouredin a thin stream into strong alcohol with constant agitation. The preci-

pitated peptone is separated after some hours and washed with alcohol, and re-

dissolved in a small quantity of water. The solution is again precipitated by

pouring it into alcohol in the same way as before, and the precipitate washed and

dried.

   Flasks having been half filled with the liquid thus prepared (in 1000, two each
of nitre and Epsom salts, a trace of phosphate of lime, twenty-five parts of grape-
sugar, and four parts of peptone), each is boiled for ten minutes, closed while boil-
ing with the earthenware plate as above described, and placed as soon as it is cool

in the warm chamber at 30° 0. The experiment so made gave, without any

exception, a positi^-e result in every case. After two or three days the fluid was
crowded with actively moving JBaderhnn termo.

   In June last I published in ' Nature ' a repetition of Dr. Bastian's experiments,
with a variation not of the liquid, but of the mode of heating. Instead of boiling
the flasks for ten minutes over the open flame and closin^' them in ebullition, I

boiled them, closed them hennetically, and then placed tliera in a digester, in
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  133

which they were subjected to ebullition under a pressure of 2 inches or more of
mercury. The result was negative. There was no development of Bacteria.

   Since the publication of these experiments Huizinga s have appeared. His

result, regarded as a proof of spontaneous generation, is clearly not superior to

Bastian's. His substitution of a soluble immediate principle for an insoluble mixed
product like cheese, and the use of a definite solution of sugar and salts, are not
material improvements. The question is not whether the germinal matter of
Bacteria is present, but whether it is destroyed by the process of heating. Conse-
quently what is necessary is not to alter the liquid, but to make the conditions
of the experiment, as regards temperature, as exact as possible. In this respect
Iluizinga's experiment is a confirmation of Bastian's, and nothing more.

   I have recently repeated Huizinga's experiments with the same modifications as

regards temperature as tliose employed in my repetition of the turnip-cheese experi-

ments. The result has been the same. In all essential respects I have followed
the method described by him in his paper. I have prepared the solution of salts,
grape-sugar, and peptone in exact accordance with his directions. To obviate his

objection as to the absence of air, I have introduced the liquid, not into flasks, but
into strong glass tubes closed hermetically at each end and only half filled with
liquid, the remainder of the tube containing air at the ordinary tension. Each of
these tubes, after having been subjected to the temperature of ebullition under 2
inches of mercury for half an hour, has been kept since September 10 at the tem-

perature of fermentation (32° C). Up to the time of my leaving London for

Bradford no change whatever had taken place in the liquid.
   As a control experiment I opened one of the tubes immediately after boiling, and

introduced a drop of distilled water. It became opalescent in twenty- four hours.

On the Electrical Plienomemt, wliich accompany the Contractions of the Leaf of

                       Dionaea muscipula. Bi/ Dr. Btjrdon Sanderson.

   It is well known that in those structures in the higher animals which are
endowed with the property of contracting when stimulated, viz. nerve and muscle,
this property is associated'with the existence of voltaic currents which have defi-

nite directions in the tissue. These currents have been the subject of very carefid
observation by physiologists. They require delicate instruments for their investi-
gation, but the phenomena dependent on them admit of the application of the most

exact measurements. The constant current which can be shown to exist in a
muscle is called the normal current. The most important fact with reference to it
is that it exists ouly so long as the muscle is alive, and that it ceases during the
moment that the muscle is thrown into action. Other characteristics of the
muscle-currents were referred to, which we have not space to mention.

    In certain plants said to possess the property of irritabilit}-, contractions of cer-
tain organs on irritation occur which strikingly suggest a correspondence of func-

tion between them and the motor organs of animals. Among the most remarkable

are those of Drosera and some other plants belonging to the same natural order,
particularly the well-known "\"enus's Flytrap (Dionati viuscipulu). The sensitive

plant, the common monkey flower, the rock CiHus, afford other examples.
    Strange as it maj' seem, the question whether these contractile movements are

accompanied with the same electrical changes as those which occur in the con-
traction of muscle and in the functional excitation of nerve has never yet been

investigated by vegetable physiologists. Mr. Darwin, who for many years has
devoted much attention to the animal-like functions of Dioncea and Drosera,

kindly furnished plants for the purpose of the necessary experiments, which have
been made by Dr. Sanderson in the laboratory of University College, London. The
result has been that the anticipations he had formed have been confirmed as to the
 existence of voltaic currents in these parts, and particularly in the leaf oi Dionaa.

By a most remarkable series of experiments, made with the aid of Sir W. Thomson's

 galvanometer, he has shown that these currents are subject, in all respects in which
 they have been as yet investigated, to the same laws as those of muscle and nerve.

                   Address to the Department of Anthropology.

                          By John Beddoe, M.D., F.R.S,

   The position of Anthropologj' in the British Association, as a pennanent depart-
ment of the Section of Biology, being- now fully assured, and its relations to the

allied and contributory sciences beginning to be well understood and acknowledged,

1 have not thought it necessary, in opening: the business of the department, to

follow the example of my predecessors. Professor Turner and Colonel Lane Fox.

The former of tliese gentlemen, at our Edinburgh Meeting, devoted his opening

address to the definition, history, and boundaries of our science ; the latter, at

Brighton, in the elaborate essay which many of you must Imve listened to, not

only discussed its relations to other sciences, but gave an illustrative survey of a

great portion of its field and of several of its problems.

   But while, on the one hand, I feel myself incompetent to follow these prece-

dents with success, on the other I am encouraged to take a difii^reut line by the

--consideration that if, as we are fond of saying in this department, " the proper

study of mankind is man" if, that is, anthropology ought to interest every body,

then assuredly the anthropology of Yorkshire ought to interest a Yorkshire

audience.

Large as the county is, and sharply marked oft" into districts by striking

diversities of geological structure, of climate, and of surface, there is an approach

to unity in its political and ethnological history which could scarcely have been

looked for. Nevertheless we must bear in mind the threefold division of the

Weshire-- not that into ridings, but that pointed out by nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          have, first, the

western third, the region of Carboniferous limestone and Millstone-grit, of narrow

valleys and  cold  rainy moorlands                                                      secondly, the  great  plain                                                                                                                                                                                                   of  York, the  region,

roughly speaking, of the Trias, monotonously fertile, and having no natural

defence except its numerous rivers, which, indeed, have sometimes served rather as

a gateway to the invader than as a bulwark against him                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                to this plain Ilolderness
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

and the Vale of Pickering may be regarded as eastern adjuncts. Thirdly, we have

the elevated region of the east, in the two very dissimilar divisions of'the moor-

lands and the wolds ; these are the most important parts of Yorkshire to the

prehistoric archajologist, but to the modern ethnologist they are comparatively of

little interest.

   The relics of the palssolltliic period, so abundant in the south of England, are,
I believe, almost wholly wanting in Yorkshire, where archasology begins with
the neolithic age, and owes its foundations to Canon Greenwell of Durham, Mr.

Mortinier of Drifileld, Mr. Atkinson of Danby, and their predecessors in the ex-

mploration of the barrows of Cleveland and the Wolds, whose results figure largely
    the ' Crania Britannica ' of Davis and Thuruam, themselves, by the way, both
\atives of the city of York.

  The earliest inhabitants we can distinctly recognize were the builders of certain
TKANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  135

long liarrowi?, such as that of Scamridge in Cleveland. There is still, I believe,

some diiference of opinion among the anthropologists of East Yorkshire (where,

--by the way, in the town of Hull, the science flourishes under the auspices of a

local Anthropological Society) still, I say, some difference of opinion as to

whether the long-barrow folk were racially diverse from those who succeeded
them and who buried their dead in roimd barrows. But Canon Greenwell at

least adheres to Thurnam's doctrine, and holds that Yorkshire, or part of it, was

occupied at the period in question, perhaps 3000 years ago, by a people of moderate

or rather short statm-e, with remarkably long and narrow heads, who were ignorant
of metallurgy, who buried their dead imder long ovoid barrows, with sanguinary

rites, and wlio labour imder strongly founded suspicions of cannibalism.

   Of the subsequent period, generally known as the bronze age, the remains in
Yorkshire, as elsewhere, are vastly more plentiful. The Wolds especially, and the
Cleveland hills, abound with round barrows, in which either burnt or unburnt

bodies have been interred, accompanied sometimes with weapons or ornaments of

bronze, and still more often with flint arrow-heads. Where bones are found, the

.skull presents what Barnard Davis considers the typical British form ; i. e. it is

generally rather short and broad, of considerable capacity and development, with
features harsh and bonj-. The bodily frame is usually tall and stalwart, the
stature often exceeding (5 feet, as in the well-known instance of the noble savage of
Gristhorpe, whose skeleton is preserved in the Scarborough Museum.

   Though certain facts, such as the known use of iron in Britain before Csesar's

time and its extreme rarity in these barrows, and some little diiference in pro-

portion between the skulls just described and the type most common among our
modem British Kelts, do certainly leave room for doubt, I have little hesitation in
referring these round barrows to the Brigantes and Parisii*, the known occupants
of Yorkshire before the Boman conquest.

   Both what I will term provisionally the pure long-barrow and the pure round-
barrow types of cranium are represented among our modern countrymen. But the
former is extremely rare, while the latter is not uncommon. It is probable enough
that the older type may, in amalgamating with the newer and more powerful one,
have bequeathed to the Kelts of our own time the rather elongated form wliicli
prevails among them. Whether this same older type was really Iberian is a point

of great interest, not yet ripe for determination.

   Another moot point is the extent to which the population of modem England is
derived from the colonists introduced under the Roman occupation. It is my own

impression that the extent, or rather the intensity of such colonization, has been

overestimated by my friend Mr. Thomas Wright and his disciples. I take it that,
in this respect, the Roman occupation of Britain was somewhere between our

own occupations of India and of Soiitli -Vfiica, or perhaps still more nearly like
that of Algeria by the French, who have tlieir roads, villas, and military esta-
blishments, and even considerable communities in some of the towns, but who
constitute but a very small percentage of the population, and whose traces would
almost disappear in a few generations, could the communication with the mother

country be cut oft".

   If, however, any traces of the blood of the lordly Romans themselves, or of that

more numerous and heterogeneous mass of people whom they introduced as

legionaries, auxiliaries, or colonists, are yet recognizable anywhere' in this countv,

it may probably be in the city of York, or in the neighbourhood of Ciitterict.
The size and splendour of ancient Eburacum, its occupation at various times as a
sort of military capital by the Emperor Severus and others, its continued existence
through the Anghan and Anglo-Unnish periods, and its subsequent comparative

freedom from such great calamitiesf or vicissitudes as are apt to cause great and
sudden changes of population, might almost induce us to expect to find such vestiges.

If Greek and Gothic blood still assert themselves in the features and figau-es of the

people of Aries, if Spanish characteristics arc still recognizable in Bruges, why not
Italian ones in York ? It may be so ; but I must confess that I have not' seen

them, or liave failed to recognize them. Catterick, the site of ancient Cataracto-

nium, I have not visited.

Of the Anglian conquest of Yorkshire we know very little, except that it was

accomplished gradually by successive efforts, that the little district of Elmet, in

the neighbourhood of Leeds, continued British for a while, and that Carnoban

--(which is almost certainly Craven) is spoken of by a Welsh writer as British after

all the rest of the country had ceased to be so a statement probable enough in

itself, and apparently corroborated by the survival of a larger number of Keltic words

in the dialect of Craven than in the speech of other parts of Yorkshire.

Certain regulations and expressions in the Northumbrian laws (among others the

less value of a churl's life as compared with that of a thane) have been thought to

indicate that the proportion of the British population that remained attached to

tlie soil, under Anglian lords, was larger in the north than in some other parts of

England.  The premises are, however, insufficient to support  the conclusion                                                          and,
                                                                                                                                   ;

on the other hand, we are told positively by Bede that Etiielfrith Fleisawr drove

out the British inhabitants of extensive districts. The singular discoveries

of Boyd Uawkins and his coadjutors in the Settle Cave, where elaborate orna-

ments and enamels of Romano-British type .are found in conjimction with indica-

tions of a squalid and miserable mode of life long endured, attest clearly the

calamities of the natives about that period (the early part of the seventh century),

and show that even the remote dales of Craven, the least Anglian part of York-

shire, afforded no secure refuge to the Britons of the plains, tlie unfortunate heirs

of Roman civilization and Roman weakness. The evidence yielded by local names

does not differ much from that of the same kind in other parts of England. It

proves that enow of Welshmen survived to transmit their names of the principal

natural features (as Ouse, Derwent, Wharfe, Dan, Roseberry, Pen-y-gent), and of

certain towns and villages (as York, Catterick, Beverley, and Ilkley), but not

enow to hinder the speedy adoption of the new language, the renaming of many

settlements, and the formation of more new ones with Anglian names. The sub-

sequent Danish invasion slightly complicated this matter ; but I think it is pretty

safe to say that the changes in Yorkshire were more nearly universal than in

counties like Devonshire, where we know that the descendants of the Welsh con-

stitute the majority. If the names of the rivers Swale and Hull be really Teutonic,

as Greta undoubtedly is, the fact is significant ; for no stream of equal magnitude

with the Swale, in the south of England, has lost its Keltic appellation.

  We do not know much of the Anglian type, as distinguished from the Scandi-

navian one which ultimately overlaid it almost everywhere to a greater or less

depth. The cranial form, if one may judge of it by the .skulls found in the ancient

cemetery of Lamel Hill near Y'ork, was not remarkably fine, certainly not superior

to the ancient British t^i'pe as Icnown to us, to which, moreover, it was rather in-

ferior in capacity. There is some resemblance between these Lamel-Hill crania

and the Belair or Burgundian type of Switzerland ; while the Sion or Helvetian

type of that coimtry bears some likeness to our own Keltic form.

" The group of tumuli called the Danes' Graves, lying near Driffield, and described

by Canon Greenwell in the ' Archseological Journal', have yielded contents which

are a puzzle for anthropologists. Their date is subsequent to the introduction of

the use of iron. Their tenants were evidently not Christians ; but they belonged to

a settled population.  The mode of interment resembles nothing Scandinavian
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

and the form of the crania is narrower than usual, at least in modern times, in

Norway and Denmark. It is hazardous to conjecture any thing about them ; but
I shoidd be more disposed to refer them to an earlj' Anglian or Frisian settlement

than to a Danish one.

  We come now to the Danish invasions and conquest, which, as well as the

Norman one that followed, was of more ethnological importance in Y'orkshire than

in most other parts of England. The political history of Deira from the ninth
century to the eleventh, the great number of Scandinavian local names (not

greater, however, in Yorkshire than in Lincolnshire), and the peculiarities of the

local dialect, iudicate that Danes and Norwegians arrived and settled, from time

to time, in considerable numbers. But in estimating those numbers we must

make alln^\'auce for their energy and audacity, as well as for the very near kinship
                    TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.      137

between the Danes and the Northumbrian Angles, which, though it did not pre-

vent sanguinary struggles between them at first and great destruction of life, must

have made amalgamation easy, and led the natives readily to adopt some of the

characteristics of the invaders.

Whatever the Danish element in Yorkshire was, it was common to Lincolnshire

and Nottinghamshire and to the north-eastern part of Norfolk, and it was com-

paratively weak in Northumberland and even in Durham. In Yorkshire itself it

was irregularly distributed, the local names in by, toft, and thwaite and the

like being scattered in a more or less patchy manner, as may be seen on Mr.

Taylor's map. They are very prevalent in Cleveland, as lias been shown by Mr.

Atkinson. Again, the long list of the landowners of the county under Edward

the Confessor, given in Domesday book, contains a mixture of Anglian with

Scandinavian names, the latter not everywhere -preponderating. Here, again,

Cleveland comes out very Danish. I am inclined to believe that the Anglian

population was, in the first fury of the invasion, to some extent pushed westwards

into the hill-country of the West Riding, though even here distinctly Danish

names, such as Sowerby, are quite common. Beverley and Holderness perhaps

remained mainly Anglian.

The Norman conquest fell upon Yorkshire, and parts of Lancashire and Durham,

with uaexampled severity. It would seem that the statement of William of

Malmesbury, that the land lay waste for many years through the length of 60 miles,

was hardly, if at all, exaggerated. The thoroughness and the fatal effects of this

frightful devastation were due, no doubt, partly to the character of William, who,

having once conceived the design, carried it out with as much completeness and

regidarity as ferocity, and partly to the nature of the couatry, the most populous

--portion of which was level and devoid of natural fastnesses or refuge but also, in

some degree to the fact that the Northumbrians had arrived at a stage of material

civilization at which such a mode of warfare would be much more formidable than

while they were in a more barbarous condition, always prepared for fire and sword,

and living, as it were, from hand to mouth. Long ages afterwards the Scots told

Froissart's informants that they could afford to despise the incursions of the English,

who could do them little harm beyond burning their houses, which they could soon

build up again with sticks and tui'fj but the unhappy Northumbrians were already

beyond that stage.

In all Yorkshire, including parts of Lancashire,Westmoreland, and Cumberland,

Domesday numbers only about 500 freemen, and not 10,000 men altogether. This

great destruction, or rather loss of population (for it was due in some measure to

the free or forced emigration to Scotland of the vanquished), did not necessarily

imply ethnological change. Let us examine the evidence of Domesday on this

point. It agrees with that of William of Malmesbury, that the void created by

devastation remained a void, either entirely or to a great extent. Whole parishes

and districts are returned as "waste." In one instance IIG freemen (sockmanni)

are recorded to have held land in King Edward's time, of whom not one remained;

in another, of 108 sokemen only 7 remained. But foreigners did settle in the
county to some extent, either as military retainers of the new Norman lords, as their

tenants, or as burgesses in the city of York, where 145 francigense (Frenchmen)

are recorded as inhabiting houses.

   Of the number maintained by way of garrisons by the new nobility, one can

form no estimate ; but considering the impoverished and helpless condition of the
surviving natives, such garrisons would probably not be large. But from the

enumeration of mesne tenants, or middlemen, some inferences may perhaps be

drawn. On six great estates, comprising the larger part of Eastern aud Central

Yorkshire, sixty-eight of these tenants are mentioned by name, besides 11 milites,

or men-at-arms. Only 11 of the 68 bear names undoubtedly English ; and none of
them have large holdings, as is the case witli some of those bearing Norman names.

On the lands of Drogo de Bevrere, about Holderness, several of the new settlers

were apparently Flemings.

   The westernpart of the county, however, or the greater part of it, had been
granted to two lords who pursued a more generous policy. Alan, count of Bretagne,

the founder of Richmond, had twenty-three tenants, besides twelve milites, men-

at-arms with very small holdings. Of the twenty-three, nine were Englishmen, in

several instances holding as dependents the whole or part of what had been their

own freeholds. The Breton ballads and traditions seem to favour the supposition
that Count Alan's Breton followers mostly returned home ; and Count Hersart de
la ViUemarqu(5e, the well-known Breton archaeologist, informed me that his
ancestors returned to Bretagne from Yorkshire in the twelfth century. On the

whole, I do not think it probable that the Breton colony was nimierous enough to

leave distinct and permanent vestiges ; but if any such there are, they may be
looked for in the modern inhabitants of Richmond and Gilling.

 --Ilbert de Lacy, again, had a great domain, including most part of the wapentakes

of Morley, Agbrigg, Skyrack, and Staincross extending, that is, far to the north

and south of our present place of meeting. Bradford, by the way, was then hardly

it in the time of Edward the Confessor, when it was valued at four pounds yearly

but at the time of the sm-vey it was waste and worth nothing.

  Sixty -seven mesne tenants under Ilbert de Lacy are mentioned, of whom no less

than forty-one bore English names, and only twenty-six foreign ones. It is pro-

bable therefore that in this important part of the county the ethnological change

wrought by the Conquest was not greater, if so great as in England generally, but

that in the centre, east, and north-east it was of some moment, and that the

Scandinavian element of population suflered and lost more than the Anglian.

It might be a matter of some interest to a minute ethnologist or antiquarian to

trace out fully the local history after the Conquest from an ethnological point of

view, investigating particularly the manner and source of the repeopling of the

gi'eat plain of York.

After this had been completed, no further change of ethnological importance took

place during several centuries. The Flemings and Frisians, who, in considerable

numbers, settled at various times in Leeds, Halifax, and Wakefield, whether drawn

hither by the course and opportunities of trade, or driven by the persecutions of

Philip II. and the Roman Catholics, brought in no new element, and readily

amalgamated with the kindred race they found here.

The more recent immigrations into the West Riding and Cleveland from all parts

of Britain, and even from the continent of Europe, have interest of other kmds.

Vast as they have been, they have not yet obscured in any great degi-ee the local

types, physical or moral, which still predominate almost everywhere, though

tending of course to assimilate themselves to those of the mixed population of

England in general.

   In describing these types I prefer to use the words of Professor Phillips, who, in

his ' Rivers of Yorkshire,' has di-awn them in true and vivid colom's. He speaks

of three natural groups :

   " First. Tall, large-boned, muscular persons ; visage long, angular ; complexion
fair or florid ; eyes blue or grey ; hair light, brown or reddish. Such persons in all

parts of the county fomi a considerable part of the population. In the North

Riding, from the eastern coast to the western mountains, they are plentiful.

" Second. Person robust ; visage oval, full and rounded ; nose often slightly

aquiline ; complexion somewhat embrowned, florid ; eyes brown or grey ; hair
brown or reddish. In the West Riding, especially in the elevated districts, very

powerful men have these characters.

" Third. Person of lower stature and smaller proportions ; visage short, rounded

complexion embrowned; eyes veiy dark, elongated; hair very dark. Individuals

having these characters occur in the lower grounds of Yorkshire, as in the valley

of the Aire below Leeds, in the vale of the Derwent, and the level regions south

of York."

   I have chosen to quote from Professor Phillips rather than to give descriptions

of my own, both because his acquaintance with the facts is more extensive than
mine, and bocause I desire to pay my small tribute to the genius and insight of the

author of a work so unique and so admirable as his upon Yorkshire.

  He ascribes the first and second of these types mainly to a Scandinavian, the last

to a Romano-British, or possibly Iberian origin ; and appears to think that the

first, the tall, fair, long-faced breed, resembles the Swedes, and that the second}
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                                                                      139

the brown burly breed of the West Riding, is more Norwegian in character. He

probably selects the Swedes as the purest or most typical of the Scandinavian

nations. For my own part, I am disposed to treat the first as Norwegian more

than ^Vnglian, the second as Anglian rather than Norse, and Norse rather than

British. The tall fair type engrosses most of the beauty of the north, having

often an oval face, with a fine straight profile nearly appro.aching the Greek, as

Knox and Barnard Davis, two close observers, have both remarked. And it is

markworthy that it reappears in force almost everywhere in Britain where Norse

blood abounds, e.g. in Shetland, Orkney, Caithness, in the upper class of the

Hebrideans, in Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lonsdale, about Lincoln (where

Professor Phillips also noted it) .and the Vale of Trent, and about the towns of

Waterford and Wexford. The second type, on the other hand, much resembles a

Aprevailing form in Staftbrdshire, a very Anglian county.                                                                                                                       notable point about it

is the frequency of eyes of a neutral undecided tint, between light and darlc, green,

brown, and grey, the hair being comparatively light. The third is of more doubtful

and of more manifold origin. Iberian, Britokeltic, Roman, Breton, Frenchman,

may all or any of them have contributed to its prevalence. I am inclined to think,

though on rather slender grounds, that it is common in some of the districts de-

populated by the Conqueror. Professor Phillips speaks of its smaller proportions
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

but it includes many robust men. It is probably far from well representing the
Brigantian type, which seems to me to have influenced the other types, but rarely

to crop out at all purely.

The breadth of the head is on the average somewhat greater in Yorkshire iJian

in other parts of Britain                                                                                            so we are informed by the hatters.                         In this the natives

of Yorkshire agree with those of Denmark and Norway, who have rather broader

heads than those of Sweden and Friesland.

I have already spoken of the colours of the eyes and hair. The latter is on the

whole lighter in Yorkshire than in most parts                                                                        of England                                                 but  dull  rather  than

bright shades prevail. In the east, at Whitby, Bridlington, and Beverley, in Tees-

dale and Middle Airedale, light hair is particularly abundant ; in Craven, as might

have been expected, it is less so : other parts of the county are not so well known

to me ; and in this matter I have to trust to my own observation.

   As to the stature and bulk of the people, however, I have much and accurate

information, through the kindness of numerous obser\'ers, some of them of repute

as naturalists. These are Mr. Atkinson of Danby, Mr. Tudor of Kirkdale, Dr.

Wright of Melton, Dr. Christy of the North Riding Asylum, Drs. Kelburne King

and Casson of Hull, Mr. Ellerton of Middlesborough, Mr. Wood of Richmond, Mr.

Kaye of Beutham, Mr. Edy of Grassington, Dr. Paley of Ripon, Dr. Ingham of
Haworth, Messrs. Armitage of Famley, Dr. Wood of Kirkby Overblow, Dr. Aveling

Mand Mr. Short of Sheffield, Mr. ilner, late of Wakefield Prison, and a clergyman
on the Wolds, whom the prejudices or fears of his parishioners will not allow me

to name. "A Yorkshireman," complained this last gentleman, " is a difficult animal

to catch and weigh and measiu:e ;" but a very large niunber of them have been

subjected to these processes by my obliging con-espondents. The general result is

that in the rural districts they are remarkably tall and stalwart, though not, except

--in parts of the west, so heavy as their apparent size would indicate but that in the

towns, and especially in Sheffield, they are rapidly degenerating ; and I conclude

from the Haworth report that the same is the case in the manufacturing villages.

In many of the rural districts the average ranges between 5 feet 8 and 5 feet 9 inches,

and about Richmond and on the Bentham Fells is considerably higher ; while at
Sheffield, and even at Haworth, it may hardly reach 5 feet inches. The causes
of this great degeneration are manifold : some of them may easily be traced ; but

either the will or the power to remedy the evil is wanting.

   Of the moral and intellectual endowments of Yorkshiremeu, it may perhaps

appear presumptuous or invidious to speak ; but the subject is too interesting to be
passed by in silence, and I will endeavour to treat it without either " extenuating,

or setting down aught in malice." In few parts of Britain does there exist a more
clearly marked moral type. To that of the Irish it has hardly anv affinity ; but
the Scotchman and the Southern Englishman alike recognize the difl'erences which

distinguish the Yorkshire character from their own, but are not so apt to appre-

ciate the numerous respective points of resemblance. The character is essentially

Teutonic, including the shrewdness, the truthfulness without candour, the perse-
verance, energy, and industry of the Scotch, but little of their frugality, or of

the theological instinct common to the Welsh and Scotch, or of the imaginative

genius, or the more brilliant qualities which sometimes light up the Scottish

character.

   The sound judgment, the spirit of fair-play, the love of comfort, order, and
cleanliness, and the fondness for heavy feeding are shared with the Saxon
Englishman but some of them are still more strongly marked in the Yorkshire-

man, as is also the bluff independence a very fine quality when it does not degene-
rate into selfish rudeness. The aptitude for music was remarked by Giraldus
Cambrensis seven centuries ago ; and the taste for horseflesh seems to have
descended from the old Norsemen, though it maj' have been fostered by local
circumstances. The mind, like the body, is generally very vigorous and energetic,
and extremely well adapted to commercial and industrial pursuits, as well as to the
cultivation of the exact sciences ; but a certain defect in imaginative power must,
I think, be admitted, and is probably one reason, though obviously not the only
one, why Yorkshire, until quite modern times, was generally behindhand in politics
and religion, and why the number of her sous who, since Cajdmon, have attained

to high eminence in literatm'e is not above the average of England.

 The Ser])ent in connexion lulth Primitive Metallurffj/. By A. W. Bcckland,

    In considering the innumerable serpent legends which have descended to us from
an immeasurable antiquity, wc cannot fail to be struck with the remarkable fact
that by far the larger number represent the serpent either as the guardian of hidden

treasure and revealer of hidden knowledge, or as in some way connected with gold
and gems. Pursuing our inquiries further, we find almost invariably that all the

heroes and gods with whom the serpent is associated are also credited with some

mysterious power over riches, agriculture, and atmospheric phenomena : they are
always the pioneers of civilization, the teachers of agriculture and of mining : their

age is the golden age of the people over whom they reign ; and in all these instances

the serpent is the Agathodasmon, the good and benevolent deitj^ sometimes the
creator, almost always the first and oldest of gods or demigods, and in this character
is generally accompanied by an %g§ as an emblem of the world, or a cone symbolical
of the sun or fire, these serpent races being invariably worshippers of the sun and earth.

But we find that this character of the serpent is confined to Turanian races, or to those
nations who have at some time or other passed under Turanian influences. Among

the Aryans and Semites the serpent is looked upon as a form of evil, although this

idea is modified in many cases by a survival of primitive belief, so that in Hindostan

he is still regarded with veneration, although the origin of that veneration can
generally be traced to aboriginal tribes. It would therefore appear that the serpent

may yet become a very important ethnological guide ; and being traced back to the

age of totemism, and read by the light of legends confirmed by early monuments,
it may probably be assumed that the primitive tribe or tribes bearing the serpent
as a totem were also the first metal workers, and had acquired their knowledge of

metals in some way through the instrumentality of the totem, for this reason so

highly and so widely venerated. It would also appear that these early serpent
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  141

tribes carried tlieir knowledge from the parent hive (probabl}' in Central Asia or
India, where the precious metals abound) across Asia, Africa, Europe, and even to
America, leaving traces of their presence everywhere in serpent symbols, serpent
mounds, megalithic monuments, and the earliest traces of metallm-gy, confined,

however, to the use of the three precious metals in their pure unsmelted form. And

it would further appear that the connexion with America was broken before smelted
metals and iron became known, the art of smelting having probably been an acci-
dental discovery of the Aryan successors of the early serpent tribes. This serpen-
tine origin of metallurgy the author has endeavoured to set forth at some length
in this paper, believing it to be a matter worthy of further investigation, being
apparently confirmed by the present veneration of the serpent existing among
Turanian races, and the absence of serpent traditions among savages living in a
purely stone age, excepting in the Fiji Islands, where the inhabitants bear traces
of great admixture witn Asiatic tribes.

Observations on Professor Gennarelli's Pajoer " On the Existence of a Race of
   Med Men in Northern Africa and Southern Europe in Prehistoric Times'^

   By C. H. E. Caemichael, M.A.

   This communication gave an analysis of a paper recently read before the Anthropo-
logical and Ethnological Society of Italy by Prof. Gennarelli. The arguments ad-
duced rest partly on the exposition of various myths, and partly on so-called histo-
rical evidence furnished by the hieroglyphics of Egypt and the pottery of Etruria,

where representations of men are coloured red, and those of women of a lighter shade.
As a consequence of the discussion of Gennarelli's hypothesis, an Italian Committee

has been formed for the study of the primitive races of Italy.

                On Prehistoric Names of Weapons, 5?/ Hyde Clarke.

   This was a first attempt to apply the evidence of philological science to the con-
sideration of the distribution of tlie names of weapons in illustration of the distri-
bution of the weapons themselves among various races. Examples were taken from
the Indian region, West Africa, North America, South America, and Australia, of

the roots BK, BN, KN, and DM, applied to arroio and dart, knife, axe or hatchet,
spear or lance. Of one of these an example was given in Naga (India) of hipi and

takoaha, and in Houssa (Africa) of kebia and takobi. In the latter triliteral epoch,
the fanciful reference of weapons to the tongue as darting was mentioned in degen
and tongue, lancea and lingua, gladius and glotta. Examples were also given from

Australia.

    On the Comparative Chronology of tlie Migrations of Man in America in
              relation to Comparative Philology. By Hyde Ciaeke.

   The object of this paper is to show tliat, so far as the evidence of language is aa
yet available and so far as probabilities go, the languages and culture of 'America
are connected with those of the Old World, and that there is no exclusive or
indigenous American language, grammar, or culture. The inference drawn is that
there is an original community of races and of culture, but that the culture was
arrested in its development by the stoppage of migration of the advanced races.

Successive migrations are declared to represent successive geological formations,

and the essay is made to lay the foundation of the comparative chronology of man.
The earliest migration determined by philology is that of the three languages of
the Negi'itos or Pygmeans, allied to the Mincopies of the Andamans. To the austral
branch are assigned the Natchez and Muskogulge, or Creek of North America, the
Alikulip and Tekeenika of Tierradel Fuego ; to the septentrional belong the North-
American Shoshoni, Utah, Comanch, &c., the Netela and Kij, the Central American
Bayano and Darien, and the South-American Mayoruna andlviriri ; and to the polar

the Eskimo.

   To the Lenca of Honduras are joined the Coretu of South America as allied to
--142 REPORT 1873.

the Kouri of West Africa. The great^ Carib group is connected with those of
Dahomey and Whydah.

   The close connexion of the Guarani and Omagua with the Abhaas of Caucasia and
the Agaw of the Nile, in grammar and roots, embraces the Guarani, Tupi, Om-agiia,
Mundrucu, Apiaca of Brazil, the Movima Saraveca &c. of the Missions, the S. Pedro
and Coretu of the Orinoco. More distant are the Skwali, Sekumne, and Tsamak

of California.

   The want of better knowledge was accounted for by imperfect information as to

the languages of the Old and the New World, and by the disappearance of whole

formations of languages, leaving only surviving a few detached and ill-connected

members, much altered by subsequent influences.

  A tradition of the Americas and Australia was attributed to the Greek, Roman,

and mediaeval geographers.

 kingdom and repulsed European forces.

    On the Report concerning Bushman researches of Dr. W. U. Bleeic, Ph.D.
                                    By Hyde Clarke.

    Dr. Bleek had been supplied by the authorities of the Cape of Good Hope with
 a large munljer of Bushmen convicts. From these he had written down more than

 four thousand columns (half pages quarto) of text, besides a dozen genealogical

 tables, and other genealogical, geographical, pathological, &c. notices. An English-

 Bushman vocabulary of 142 pages and a Bushman-English one of (100 pages have
 been formed. The mj'thology in which animals and heavenly objects are personified

 is largely illustrated. It is expected that the Cape legislature will authorize the
 publication of these important materials for anthropological investigations.

                    On the Northern Ratige of the Iberians in Europe.
                         By W. Boyd Dawkins, M.A., F.ll.S.

    The range of the Iberian Basque, or Euskarian peoples, characterized b)' their
 small stature, dark complexion, jet-black hair and eyes, oval face, and orthognathic
 skull, Avas examined from the point of view offered by history. In the earliest
 records the population of the Iberic peninsula was composed of two elements, the
 northern, to which its name is due, and the southern or Celtic, the fusion between
 the two being proved by the name Celtiberi, or Castilians. In France, at the time
 of the conquest by the Ivomans, the Iberic element was represented by the Aquitani
 in the region boimded by the Garonne and Gironde, but whose north-eastern frontier
 was subsequently extended to the Loire (Ligur). Between them and the allied
 Ligmian tribes on the borders of the Mediten-anean a broad band of Celtse inter-
 posed, marking that the eastern Pyrenees was the route by which the Celtic invasion
 of Spain took place. The Beiges pressed on the Celtae, occupying the valley of the
 Bhine. The same sequence of peoples was maintained in Britain. In the west of
 Wales the Iberians were represented by the Silures ; the Celtse occupied the greater
 part of the island, and the Belgw had taken possession of the maritime region. The
 dark-haired inhabitants of South-west Ireland were of Iberian descent, and the
 Celta3 possessed most of the island. These " ethnological islands " of Iberians, in
 Ireland, in Wales, in South-east France, and it may be added in Sicily, isolated by
 a sea of Celt from the mainland of Basques, proved that the Iberic peoples were
 once distributed through the area under consideration before the Celtaj had driven
 them away to the west.

     This conclusion is confirmed by an examination of the contents of ossiferous
 caves and of tumuli, by which they were shown to have extended as far north

as Oban, and as far to the east as Belgium in the Neolith age, the human remains
described by himself, Busk, Thumam, Broca, Dupont, and others being of the same
type as those from Basque cemeteries in the museum of the Anthropological Society
of Paris, and the associated works of art being for the most part the same. The

mcaves of the Iberic peninsula were also occupied by Basques the neolithic stage

of culture.

   The Basque population was probably derived from Asia, and the route by which
they passed into Europe was probably the same as that by which the Celtae, Belgas,
and Germans advanced to the west rather than by way of Africa. It is also very
likely that the Basques stood in close relation to their neighbours the Etruscan, and
the two non-Aiyan peoples may have been identical in race, related to eacli other

as Celt to Belgian.

Soms Eemarl-s on Etlinic Psychology. By Egbert Duxx, F.R.C.S.

The comparative psychology of the typical races of man presents a subject for

investigation of great "interest" to many an ethnological inquirer and to all physio-

logical anthropologists, but at the same time is of a character so wide and compre-

hensive, that the author confines his remarks principally to the physiological bearings

--of the subject to cerebral psychology. He observes that, while comparative psy-

chology, in its widest sense, eiiibracesthe study and strict interpretation of all those

living experiments (to use the happy expression of Cuvier) which nature presents

to us in an ascending series in the wide domain of animal life, from the lowest

up to man himself, ethnic psychology restricts the inquiry to the genus Homo

sapiens and its typical varieties. He refers to a paper which he read at the

Cambridge Meeting of the British Association in 1862, " On the Psychological

Differences which exist among the Typical Races of Man," in which he dwelt upon

the importance of carefully studying and of contrasting and comparing the cerebral

organizations of the typical races, with the view, and as the most efficient mea,ns,

to the better understanding and elucidation of the psychological diflereuces which

exist among and characterize them. Believing as he then did, and as he still does,

that the distinctive psychical diiierences which exist among the tj'pical races will

be found to be engi-aven on their brains, he here again enforces the paramount

importance of this duty, and indicates a field of investigation and inquiry which,

if fully explored, cannot fail, as he thinks and believes, of throwing a fiood of light

upon the subject of ethnic psychology. He dwells on the labours of Gratiolet in
France, quoting the emphatic language of Professor Rolleston, of Oxford, "what

Blax Miiller had done for language and Adams for astronomy, that Gratiolet had

done for the anatomy of the brain ; " regretting at the same time that, notwithstan-

ding the labom-s of Gratiolet and the chart which he may be said to have provided

for our guidance as a standard of comparison, the brains of the typical races have

yet to be carefully examined, compared, and contrasted with each other. This

remains to be done, and is still a desideratum. He strives to impress stronyly on the
minds of others his own conviction of the necessity and importance of a more

exact knowledge than that to which we have yet attained of the cerebral structm-al
difierences which exist among the typical races. The basis of his own conviction of

the paramoimt importance of the duty of studying, contrasting, and comparing in all
the dift'erent races the nervous apparatus and organic instrumentality through which

their varying psychological phenomena are manifested, rests on the postulates that
the genus Jfomo is one, and that the brain is the instrument of the mind; and on the

consequent and legitimate corollary from these, that the distinguishing psychical

difierences which exist among the typical races are greatly ,_ if not altogether, de-
Hependent upon structural differences "in their cerebral organizations.
                                                                         says all

physiological psychologists are agreed that the vesicular matter of the great henii-

sphericaf ganglia of the brain is the sole and exclusive seat of all intellectual action

and volitional power, but that his own mind rests in the conviction, as a well-

established fact, that different parts and portions of the vesicular matter of the
cerebral hemispheres are the seat of special psychological activities and of different

kinds of mental action. He says the type of the brain is the same in all the different

races, and that in its evolution and ascensive development it passes through the

characters of the typical races of mankind are virtually and simply representations

of particular stages of the highest or Caucasian race. As the anterior lobes of the

brain are the seat of the intellectual activities, fulhiess of development and com-

plexity of structure are sure indications of the elevation of the racial type ; while,

on the other hand, the converse, as seen in the Negi'o or Bushman, is equally true, viz,

that simplicity of structure and perfect symmetry of type and arrangement of the

convolutions on both sides of the hemispheres are indisputable marks of degTadation

of function and inferiority of race. He says Gratiolet has dwelt on the importance

of studying with scrupiilous care and attention the complexities, relations, and ar-

rangements of the convolutions on the inferior, frontal, and coronal stage in all the

typical races, with a view to their psychical significance, and to the elucidation

and advancement of the study of ethnic psj'chology. In conclusion, he says that

the fact is indisputable that the large-brained European differs from and far sur-

passes the small-brained savage in the complexity of his manifestations, both intel-

lectual and moral ; but then he asks. Is not all this in strict accordance with and

--what a priori might be expected to result from organic differences in the instruments

of the higher psychical activities in other words, in the nervous apparatus of the

perceptive and intellectual consciousness ?

Notes on Coral- Caves with Human Bones in Stalagmite on Mangaia, South
                   Pacijic. By the Eev. "VV. "VYtatt Gill, B.A.

The author has resided for many years on the little island of Mangaia, one of the

seven islands constituting the Ilervey group. Mangaia is in 21° 57' south latitude,

and 158° 7' west longitude. It is nearly 20 miles in circumference, and not more

than 800 feet above the sea-level, with an unbroken fringing reef. The interior of

the island is formed of dark volcanic rock, rising in low hills striking from a single

Hat-topped centre. There is no lagoon. Streams of water from the centre por-

tion, after fertilizing some thousands of taro-plantations, find their way to the

ocean through a remarkable belt of uplifted dead coral, which, like a Cyclopean

waU, surrounds the inner part of the island. This mass of coral rock begins to rise

gradually about 200 yards from the rugged beach and slopes up to a ridge, but

towards the interior is pei-pendicular. It is from one to two miles across. In some

places the surface bristles with jagged rock sharp as spear-points. Many are the

ghastly wounds to the passenger occasioned by footslips. Numerous sea-shells,

similar to those on the present beach, are imbedded in this reef, even in the

highest parts. It is everywhere perforated by caverns and galleries. Mangaia

thus remarkably displays both the ordinarj' foi-ms of coral islands, the reef of dead

--coral upraised on the land, and the fringing reef at sea denoting elevation first and

then suDsidence both requiring a very long period of time for growth. The caves

in the dead coral have been used as habitations, as refuges, and as cemeteries.

Scores of them are filled with desiccated human bodies ; stalactite and stalagmite

abound, and form thick and fast-growing layers of limestone rock, of which the

author exhibited some specimens. In the waters lying in the hollows were nume-

rous limestone balls.

Soon after arriving in Mangaia in 1852, the author explored a great number of

--caverns on the southern part of the island. The great " cave of Tevaki " divides

into two branches the one communicating' with the sea, the other with a glittering

stalactite roof terminates in an awful chasm. Pursuit of a tribe entrenched in such a

natural fortress was   out of the  question                                    the plan adopted                                                                                                                                                                     in  such circumstances
                                                                            ;

was to starve them out. Opposite to this great cave is a lesser one with a low en-

trance. At the further end of this the author found a quantity of detached human

bones, and, close by, a number of others imbedded in the solid limestone wall of

the cavern.

mTwo years ago the rumour of the great interest felt in Europe the antiquity

of the human race reminded him of these cave-remains                                                                                                                                                                                                                and so vivid were his first
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

tached the few specimens from the rock which were exhibited.

   If any ordinary native of Maugaia were asked about these relics of humanity, he
would merely say, they were " taito, taito rava " (" old, very old "), and this would
probably delude the European inquirer into the belief that they were of remote

antiquity.

   The tradition of the " wise men " in relation to the matter is, that the sacerdotal

clan of Mautara, about the year 1718 a.d., surprised and destroyed Ruanae's can-
nibal tribe at Pukuotoi, a spot about a mile from the grotto. This event has been
celebrated in song by the chief Potiki in his ' Lament for Vaiaa,' beginning thus :

Solo  r The clan of Buanae has perished,
      \ As the reef covered with dead fish
      [ Is the ground where they fought.

The entire victorious f Let their carcases rot there !
   clan in chorus ...\ Let their carcases rot there

The bodies of some of the most distinguished were conveyed by their friends to
the neighbouring caves and piled up there on wooden platforms. As the wood
decayed, the bones were scattered over the damp floor.

  The author procured some human bones of a more remote date, but in a much better

state of preservation, a circumstance owing to the dryness of the cave in which

they were found. These relics are stated by the " wise men " to be the remains
of invaders from Tubuai, who effected a landing, and at first overran the island in

tlie reign of Anne, but were eventually deceived cind destroyed by the aborigines
of Mangaia. Anne was the fourth sovereign chief of the little island; the battle

which sealed the fate of the invaders was the fourth ever fought on Mangaia. At
first sight the bones chipped out of the rock seem to be of much higher antiquity

than the relics of the invaders from Tubuai ; yet this is not the case.
   The author concludes that the Hervey islands have been peopled in compa-

ratively recent times; and so, too, of the Eastern Pacific islands. Tahiti and
the neighbouring islands were all peopled some generations previous to the

Hervey islands, the first island colonized in that neighbourhood being Raiatea,

the centre of a widely extended and most sanguinary worship. Those islanders

speak of their ancestors as having come up from the "po " = " darkness," or from
" Hawaii " = " Savaii." By "coming up out of darkness," no doubt the lands

where the sun sets are intended ; and " Hawaii " is Savaii, the largest island in
the Samoau group. Of course "Hawaii " naturally reminds one of the great island

in the Sandwich group ; but the traditions of the Eastern islands all point west-

ward, not northward.

  A close study of the question for several years past induces the .author to believe

that the Hervey group was colonized about five or six centuries ago. The grounds

of his belief are :

   1. The fact that when in 1823 Rarotonga was discovered the twenty-fourth
" Makea " * was reigning. Allowing to each " Makea " a reign of twenty-five
years, we have a total of 600 years. Another chief on Rarotonga, named " Tino-
mana," was in 1823 the nineteenth in direct descent fi'om " Makea Karika," who

came from Samoa. Allowing, as in the former instance, twenty-five years to each
chief of this tribe, we obtain a total of 475 years.

   2. The " wise men " of Atiu confessed to the writer that the ancestors of the

present chiefs sprang from the regal IMakea family of Rarotonga.

   3. The well-known succession of priests of the three principal gods of Mangaia
supplies us witli nine very long lives. Allowing each priest to discharge his
functions during the long (probably too long) period of fifty years, we get a result
of only 4o0 years. The Mangaians themselves trace their origin to Anaiki, or

" netherworld." Now " Avaiki," " Hawaii," and " Savaii " are but slightly different

forms of one icorcl. In their songs and myths are many references to " the hosts
of Ukupolu," undoubtedly the " Upolu" of Samoa. The other islands of that group
are all mentioned in ancient Mangaian song.

   But whence did the Samoans spring ? Many words in their dialect are identical
with that spoken on the south-eastern peninsula of New Guinea. Of the Asiatic

          * "Makea" is a regal title, like "Pharaoh" and " Candaoe" of Scripture.
146 . REPORT--1873.

and Semitic origin of the Samoans and Eastern Pacific Islanders generally, the
author has no doubt.

   The instruments produced were not from the cave, but were actually used by
the present or last generation. The author pointed to a remarkable oval sling-stone
of stalagmite limestone, to the axes of jade, basalt, and greenstone, to the hafted
axes of basalt, as illustrating by recent examples the history of the extinct stone

age of Europe.

               On tlie Passage of Eastern Civilization across the Pacific,

                             By J. Paek Haeeison, M.A.

   The fact that a drift-current from the west deposits wood and other light mate-
rials upon the shores of Easter Island, and then, turning northwards, joins the

Chilean stream in its course towards the equator, goes far to support the tradi-
tions of the Eastern islanders, as well as the inhabitants of the coast of Quito, that

strangers arrived amongst them many centuries ago from the west. The author
mentioned that there is a tall race, with marked aquiline features, who formerly

--followed sun-worship and artificially elongated the lobes of the ears, that can bo

traced across the Pacific in two directions one through the islands of Sancta Crux
to California, the other through the Tonga Islands, Oparo, and Easter Island to
Peru. Numerous distinctive analogues along both routes appear to connect the
people alluded to with our east. Both in stature and profile they differed from the
races with which they mingled, and became more or less amalgamated.

                     On a hitherto undescrihed Neolithic Implement.
                   By J. SiNCLAiE HoLDEN, M.D., F.G.S., M.A.L

   This implement is a flint saw, which seems peculiar to the primitive dwellers
of the Glens of Antrim in the later stone period. It has been found in several
dolmens by the Earl of Antrim and the writer. That it is rare and local is con-
firmed by its absence from the stone-implement collections in our museums, and
its also not being mentioned by Mr. Stevens, Mr. Evans, and other writers on this
subject. It is formed from a flat flint flake by chipping a curved portion out of

its thin margin, the edge of which is bevelled and finely serrated. When held in

the hand and semirotated, it would be an excellent tool for sawing notches in a

round stick or bone, and may have been thus used to notch arrow-shafts in order

to securely tie on the barbs, and would also serve for marking tallies.
   Being found so purely local puts aside the suggestion of it having been used for

any religious rite. It is much too delicate to have been employed as a scraper,
and the manner in which old ones are -worn and fractured negatives this opinion.
Though very imlike every flint saw hitherto met with and described, this genuine

implement seems to admit of no other designation.

            A true Cerebral Theory necessary to Anthropology *.

                       By J. Kaines, D.Sc, M.A., Tr. L.A.S.

   Dr. Kaines began his paper by stating that anthropology, the science of mankind,
cannot be more than instituted as a science while physiology, or the science of
individual life, is incomplete. To render human and comparative physiology com-
plete, cerebral physiology must acquii-e positivity.

   Further, the aim of the author was to show that phrenology was the only cle

facto science of mind, it being based on physiology ; while certain pseudo-sciences
of niind, based on theological and metaphysical data, were unscientific. Dr. Kaines

briefly reviewed the labours of Gall and others who had founded and established
organology, and asked why it was that the science of cerebral physiology had fallen
into apparent disrepute. He went on to show in what way the strength and weak-

ness of the system were regarded by eminent thinkers and physiologists, such as

               * The above paper is printed in extenso in ' Anthropologia,' No. II.

G. H. Lewes, Broussais, De Blainville, and A. Bain, nearly all of whom agreed

that the fundamental position of phrenology was demonstrated. The author

--quoted freely from A. Comte's ' Philosophie Positive,' tome iii. " Biologie "

philosophical exposition and criticism of Gall's doctrine, and the means whereby it

might become, physiologically and .anatomically, scientific. He said, " Phrenolo-

gical analysis has, then, to be reconstituted, first in the anatomical, and then in
the physiological order ; and finally the two must be harmonized ; and not till

then can phrenological physiology be established upon its true scientific basis."
" If our existing phrenology isolates the cerebral functions too much, it is yet more
open to reproach for separating the brain from the whole of the nervous system."
" Phrenology has too much neglected the great influence to which the chief intel-

lectual and moral functions are subject from other physiological phenomena, as

Oabanis pointed out so emphatically while preparing the way for the philosophical
revolution which we owe to Gall."

   The paper concluded by showing that anthropology could benefit nothing from
old systems unscientifically based, and that anthropologists could only prosecute
their studies successfidly by discarding as idle all questions of origins of species,
whether human or animal, and of first and final causes, these questions being be-
j'ond settlement by such knowledge and such powers as we have.

                         On an Age of Colossi.

By John S. Psen^, F.S.A., F.G.S., F.E.G.S., F.RJ.B.A.

This paper commenced with a slight sketch of the theory of the ages of stone,

bronze, and iron, as generally recognized by anthropologists, for the purpose of

bringing forward a feature which, in the author's opinion, would at a future period

--considerably modify present ideas on this subject the geographical feature, the

eftsct of which, he thought, could be hardly understood till we were able to cor-

Herelate more perfectly the antiquities of distant countries.  argued that, as-

suming a wave of emigration from a common centre to bear forward any distinct

characteristic, whether of these recognized features or of colossi, or otherwise, such

wave might, in prehistoric times, while portions of it terminated abruptly near its

source, upon desirable spots being attamed, travel indefinitely by other sections

over an enormous area, even giving rise to secondary or subwaves of exodus.

This, in result, might produce the strange features, discovered by subsequent

travellers, of a civilized or historic age setting in, either from a succeeding wave

or some other cause, which would reach to the settlements from which the sub-

exodus proceeded, but not follow the offshoots ; hence, in an age highly historic

and civilized in a given geographical area, there might be found people with the

same features, traditions, myths, and roots of language in a barbarous or prehistoric

age or condition outside that geographical area ; and in consequence any par-

ticular age so identified might be, or seem to be, indefinitely long from the retainers

of its characteristics wandering beyond the reach of communication. That such

waves had passed over distant lands, he argued by illustration and analogy, throuo-h

various architectural features, special and peculiar, foimd in remote and distant

countries. After drawing attention to the inhabitants of what he termed the

three great centres of colossi, and which he designated as Egj-ptian, Malayan, and

pre-Mayan, or Mexican, he illustrated by diagrams and drawings the favourite

emblems of those creators of colossi, fi-om which it appeared that on a broad basis
there was both an architectural and emblematic similarity in their works the

pyramid, the monolith, the obelisk, and the elevated platform being prominent

features in each ; the worship of the sun apparently common, and colossal em-
blems of the human figure, reptilia, .and birds abounding. Easter Island, as repre-
senting Polynesia, was included, and the physical featm'es and climatic conditions

were found .approxim.ating in these different centres. He expressed a belief that

a careful study of the poetic language of the Singhalese would aid and stimulate

researches in the forest-covered cities of Ceylon, and those of the ancient Maya (if
possible) and of the Quiche peoples would unravel the mystery of the now impene-

trable cities of Mexico and Central America. While these cities, with their colossi
--148 REPORT 1873.

were so buried, we had much to learn of the history of the human family, and the

age in which their colossi were executed.
    This part of the question was (he considered) too extensive for a single paper,

and he would confine himself, by way of illustrating his argument, to what seemed
to him the result of an offshoot from such a preceding wave as he had supposed,
which he considered had laved its final billow on the shores of Britain. He first
pointed out that the highly civilized nations of Greece and Rome were not origi-

nators of colossi, but elaborators of the raw material ideas (if he might so express
himself) of the Egyptians and other earlier nations, as shown by their exquisite
symmetry, and the costliness of the materials (gold and ivory) of which some of
their most gigantic colossi were constructed, as quoted by Pliny, Pausanius, Strabo,

and other ancient writers. He then gave a number of examples of similar accom-
panying features in Britain, Egypt, Mexico, and Mala3'a. He found parallels of design

in the plans of some Oriental cities (as Rhodes), in those of some of the Chinese and
Sardinian tombs, and the horseshoe device of Stonelienge, all of which assimilate
in the circle of Copan and those of Avebury, the Giant's Ring near Belfast, and
others; and finally argued that we had not only these collateral evidences, but
actual colossi of the ancients in these lands, in enormous monoliths, in venerated

--ic\ols as, amongst others, the celebrated rock, the traditional goddess Andras, and

the enormous Wilmington giant, both in Sussex ; and the latter, as the result of

his attracting attention to it, is now being restored, with the consent and kind
assistance of the Duke of Devonshire. This figure, he quoted Ctesar and Strabo

to show, agi-eed identically with the description given by those wi-iters of the vast

Celtic deity, to which were sacrificed human victims, wild beasts and cattle, and
of which Ceesar says " they had many images."

Ifotes on Stone Implements from British Guicoia. By F. "W. Eitdlee, F.G.S.

   The specimens exhibited to the department and described in this communi-
cation were collected by Mr. C. B. Brown during his recent survey of British
Guiana. One of the implements, formed apparently of diorite, presented the form

of an acute cone, 6 inches high, with a flat circular face, about 2 inches in diameter :
this face seemed to be well adapted for grinding or pounding. Mr. Franks had
pointed out the similarity between this implement and others from the north-west
coast of America, where they are used as hammers. This specimen was found

on the Burro-burro river. Among the other implements was an adze in diorite,

found on the site of an ancient Indian village at Sheldon, at the mouth of the
Corentyne river. It was accompanied by a small carved image in a green steatitic
mineral, by fragments of coarse pottery, and by a large number of bones, including

those of the tapir.

  On the Relation of Moralit}/ to Eeligion in the Early Stages of Civilization.
                             By Edward B. Ttlor, F.B.S.

   Investigations of the culture of the lower races of mankind show morality and
religion subsisting under conditions differing remarkably from those of the higher

barbaric and civilized nations. Among the rudest tribes a well-marked standard

of morality exists, regulating the relations of family and tribal life. There also

exists among these tribes some more or less definite religion, always consisting of
some animistic doctrine of souls and other spiritual beings, and usually taking in
some rudimentary form of worship. But, unlike the higher nations, the lowest
races in no way unite their ethics and their theology. As examples, the Austra-
lians and Basutos of South Africa were adduced. The Australians believe spiri-
tual beings to swarm throughout the universe : the Basutos are manes-worshippers,
considering the spirits of deceased ancestors to influence all the events of human
life ; wherefore they sacrifice to the spirits of near relatives, that they may use their
influence with the older and more powerful spirits higher in the line of ancestiy.
Yet these races and many others have not reached the theological stage at which
man's good or evil moral actions are held to please or displease his divinities, and
to be rewarded or punished accordingly. The object of the present paper is to
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  149

trace the precise steps through which the important change was made which con-

verted the earlier unethical systems of religion into ethical ones. Thia change

appears to have been a gradual coalescence between the originally independent

schemes of morality and religion.
   In order to show the nature of such coalescence between religion and other

branches of culture not originally or not permanently connected with it, the author

traced out, on an ethnological line, the relations between religion and, on the one
hand, the rite of marriage, on the other hand the profession of medicine.

   First, as to marriage. The evidence of the lower races tends to show that

at early stages of civilization marriage was a purely civil contract. Its earliest
forms are shown amongst savage tribes in Brazil and elsewhere. The peaceable

form appears well in the custom of the marriageable youth leaving a present of

fruit, game, &c. at the door of the girl's parents ; this is a clear symbolic promise

that he will maintain her as a wife. Another plan common in Brazil is for the

 expectant bridegroom to serve for a time in the family of the bride, till he is con-
sidered to have earned her.

   The custom of buying the wife comes in at a later period of civilization, when
property suited for trade exists. The hostile form of marriage, that by capture,
has also existed among low tribes in Brazil up to modern times, the man simply

--carrying off by force a damsel of a distant tribe the antiquity of this " Sabine

marriage " in the general history of mankind being shown by its survival in coun-
tries such as Ireland and Wales, where within modern times the ceremony of
capturing the bride in a mock fight was kept up.

   Now in none of these primitive forms of marriage, as retained in savage culture,

did any religious rite or idea whatever enter. It is not till we reach the high

 savage and barbaric conditions that the coalescence between marriage and religion
takes place, as where among the Mongols the priest presides at the marriage feast,

 consecrates the bridal tent with incense, and places the couple kneeling with their
 faces to the east, to adore the sun, fire, and earth ; or, as where among the Aztecs,

 the priest ties together the garments of the bridegroom and bride in sign of union,
 and the wedded pair pass the time of the marriage festival in religious ceremonies
and austerities. So complete in later stages of culture did this coalescence become,

that many have come to consider a man-iage hardly valid unless celebrated as a
 religious rite and by a priest.

     Second, as to the relation of the profession of medicine to religion. In early
 animistic philosophy, one principal function of spiritual beings was to account for

 the phenomena of disease. As normal life was accounted for by the presence of a soul
 operating through the body in which it located itself, so abnormal life, including
 the phenomena of disease, was accounted for in savage and barbaric culture as
 caused by some intruding spirit. Thus the belief in spiritual obsession and possession
 becomes the recognized theory of disease, and the professional exerciser is the
 doctor curing disease by religious acts intended to expel or propitiate the demon.

 Since the middle period of culture, however, this eai-ly coalescence has been gi-a-

 dually breaking away, till now in the most civilized nations the craft of healing

 has become the function of the scientific surgeon or physician, and the belief and
 ceremonies of the exorcist survive in form rather than in reality.

    By these cases it is evident that coalescence between religion and other matters
 not necessarily connected with it may take place at difterent periods of culture,
 and also that this coalescence may terminate after many ages of adhesion. Having
 shown this, the author proceeded to ascertain exactly when and how in the history

 of civilization the coalescence of morality and religion took place.

    First, where manes-worship is the main principle of a religion, as among some
 North-American tribes and the Kafirs of South Africa, the keeping up of family
 relations strongly affects the morality. It is, for instance, a practice among tlie

 rude races to disinter the remains of the dead or to visit the burial-place, in order to
 keep the deceased kinsman informed as to what takes place in his family, in which lie
 is often held to take the liveliest interest. Thus it is evident any moral act of an in-
 dividual damaging to his family would be offensive to the ancestral manes, whose

 influence must therefore strengthen kindly relations among the living members of
 the tribe. Higher in the social scale this ethical influence of manes-worship takes
150 REPORT--1873.

more definite form, as when in China the divine ancestors of an emperor will re-
proach him for selfish neglect or cruelty to his nation, and even threaten to induce
their own highest divine ancestor to punish him for misdeeds. Thus among the
ancient Romans the Lares were powerful deities enforcing the moral conduct of the

family, and punishing household crime.
    Second, the doctrine of the Future Life begins at the higher levels of savagery

to afiect morals. In its first stage the doctrine of metempsychosis is seen devoid

of moral meaning, men being re-born as men or animals ; but when the distinction

appears in the higher savagery between migration into vile or noble animals, it is
not long before this distinction takes the form of reward or punishment of the good
.and wicked by their high or low re-incarnation, an idea which is the basis of the
Buddhist scheme of retributive moral transmigration through successive bodies.
In its earlier stages this doctrine was one of mere continuance, as where South-
American tribes expected the spirits of the dead to pass to another region where
they would live as on earth. Here the distinctions of earthly rank are carried pn,
the chief's soul remaining a chief, and the plebeian's soul a plebeian, but no sign
of moral retribution appears. The first stage of this seems to be where warriors
slain in battle are admitted to the paradise of chiefs in the land of the Great
Spirit. This idea, which comes into view in several districts, leads to the fuller
moral scheme in which goodness of any kind, valour, skill, &c. are more and more

held to determine the difierence between the next life of the good man in happy
lumting-grounds, or of the bad man in some dismal wilderness or subterranean

Hades. In the higher nations this element becomes more and more distinctly
marked, till the expectation of futm-e reward and the fear of future punishment
becomes one of the great motives of human life.

   Third, when theology among the rudest tribes is mostly confined to considera-
tion of ghosts, demons, and nature-spirits, the intercourse with these leads to little
inculcation of moral action. It is when ideas of the great deities become pre-
dominant, when men's minds are turned to the beneficent action of the Sun, or
Heaven, or Earth, or to a Supreme Deity yet above these, that it is conceived that
the order of nature includes moral order of human conduct. Then, as in the reli-
gion of ancient China, the universe and its Supreme Deity are regarded as furnish-
ing the model and authority regulating man's actions towards his kindred and his
subjects. Thus there presents itself, not at the beginning but the middle of the
development of religious ideas among mankind, the leading principle of a moral
 government of the world and its inhabitants.

    In these three ways it appeai-s, from the evidence of ethnology, that the vast
transition was made fi'om the earlier unethical to the later ethical systems of

religion.

GEOGEAPHY.

Address hy Sir Euthebford Aicock, K.C.B., President ofiJie Section.

I CANNOT help feeling that my claim to the title of a Geographer is much too

slight to wai-rant my appearance here as President of the Geographical Section

Myof the British Association.  misgiving as to the fitness of the choice wouW,

indeed, have precluded my accepting the honour, had I not believed that the main

object of this Association is to receive and give ventilation to any new ideas or

scientific contributions, to secure the attention of a larger audience of scientific

men than could otherwise be easily obtained for any special subject, and to pro-

mote the free interchange of opinions between persons of various pursuits and

qualifications. For this end it is not necessary that the President should himself

be competent to take a leading part in discussing the many interesting and scientific

subjectswhicharelikely to be brought forward. It is enough, I conceive, that he

should appreciate at their just value the studies of those who are willing to com-

inunicate the results of their labours, and be ready to promote the candid and im-

 artial consideration of any papers to be read and discussed. With this assurance

! will throw myself upon your indulgence for any shortcomings, and proceed with

tlie business before us.

The admirable review of geographical progi-ess during the past year presented

to the Geographical Society at its last Anniversary in May by Sii* Henry Rawlinson,

must be too fresh in the memory of those of my hearers who are interested in geo-

mygi-aphical pursuits, to require any attempt on  part to go over the same ground.

It has been published in the volimie of the Society's Transactions for the year, and

it would be superfluous, if not presumptuous, on my part, therefore, to occupy

your time by any repetition on the present occasion.

If I ventui-e at all upon this field of geographical achievements it will be

rather with a view to draw your attention to the wide scope and application of

Geography as a science, and to the mode in which geographical explorations and

discoveries lead to important results in various directions. Geography, in a popular

sense, is apt to be too much associated with a mere description of the configui-ation

of the earth, with its seas and continents, illustrated by maps. But before

--Geogi-aphy could fulfil even this very narrow and restricted conception of its

proper functions before, indeed, it could exist in any but the rudest and most im-

--perfect shape, such as we seejn mediaeval maps great progress had to be made in

astronomy and mathematics. Without these two sister sciences. Cartography, or

the process of depicting relative distances and places on the earth, either on maps

or globes, could not be carried out with any approach to certainty or accm-acy.

Explorations with a compass, and measure of distance estimated by the number

of days' journey, gave little more than such results as we find recorded in Pto-
lemy's works. The map of the world preserved in Hereford Cathedral is a cmious

sample. There the history of our race, as well as the distribution of countries, are

given on pm-ely theologic and historical or legendary data. Beginning at the

top of the circle with Paradise, it presents nearly every thing in nature and

fiction, but Geography, to the gaze of the cmious. Until the discoveiy of the
gnomon, and the means of fixing the latitude and longitude of any place by ob-

servations of the celestial bodies had been perfected, Geography could have no

existence as a science. It owes much, also, to its intimate connexion with various

branches of knowledge, and investigations into the nature and mutual relations of

objects on the earth, or forming a part of its crust, which seemingly had, at the

time of their prosecution, no direct bearing on Geogi'aphy or its objects. In
modern times only it has been fully recognized that Descriptive Geography is of

little value apart from Physical Geography ; and these, again, lose much of their

interest without their relation to Political and Historical events are traced.
   Astronomy had, in efiect, to supply the means of reducing to a systematic and

available form the accumulated materials which must now constitute Geography,

by first enabling geographers to determine with accuracy the relative position of
places, with their distance from each other, and their exact latitude and longitude.
But this power once gained, the importance of GeogTaphy and its influence over
the material interests of mankind soon became apparent, and its progi-ess as a
science has gone on increasing at a proportionately rapid rate. It was in vain
that Marco Polo twice traversed Asia in its whole breadth, from the Mediterranean
to the Great Wall of China, and lived to return and recount all the wonders he
had seen to his countrymen within the prison walls of Genoa. It only earned for
him the derisive sobriquet of Marco Millione, from the supposed fabulous nature

of the statements he made ; and although he contributed so vast an amount of new
facts to the knowledge of the earth's surface, it does not appear, even when his book
was printed a centm-y and a half later, that it had any material effect upon the science
of Geography, for want of the higher knowledge required to systematize and assi-

milate the whole.

   Later (as Colonel Yule has well pointed out in his admirable edition of Marco
Polo's book), when Vasco de Gama, doubling the Cape of Good Hope, reached

the Malabar coast, and " the great burst of discovery eastward and westward took

place," the results of all attempts to combine the new knowledge with the old
Tivere most unhappy. The first and crudest forms of such combination attempted
153 REPORT--1873.

to realize the erroneous ideas of Columbus regarding the identity of his discoveries

with the regions of the Great Khan's dominion. It was, in consequence, some time

before America could vindicate its independent position on the surface of the

globe ; while Jerusalem long remained the central point of the map, because it was

so described in the book of Ezekiel. Down nearly to the middle of the 15th

century the map of the world was, in its outline, as it had been handed down by

Biblic and other traditions sanctioned by some Fathers of the Church, " sprinkled

with a combination of classical and mediaeval legends."

  How important geographical science has become since that date, and how each

day brings fresh materials and illustrations of the importance, I need hardly point

out. The discovery by the Portuguese of a sea-route to India entirely changed the
Awhole course of commerce between Europe and Asia,
                                                    trade which had first

--enriched Tyre and the Phoenicians, and in Solomon's reign tempted the Jews to

build fleets on the Red Sea which, stiU increasing, made Alexandria the great em-

--porium of Indian wares, while in more modern times it helped to create a city

of merchant princes in Venice, abandoned from that date the caravan routes of

Asia. The Adriatic ceased to bear rich argosies from the East, and Nuremberg,

with other free cities of Germany, equally lost a source of wealth in distributing

Eastern merchandise.

This was the first and most pregnant of the great changes caused by the geo-

graphical discoveries of the 15th century. The planting of the European race in
North and South America, and especially of our own stock in the North, was a

second result, which promises to make English the predominating language of the

world, and to spread British institutions and love of liberty over the four quarters of

Howthe globe.  it has affected the destiny of the Aborigines over the new world

laid open by geographical discoveries is a less satisfactory subject of reflection;

but whatever the estimate may be of relative good and evil following in the wake

of such explorations, the influence exercised on the destinies of nations cannot be

questioned ; and amidst all the workers who contributed to these results, great and
lasting as they have been. Geographers may rightly claim a foremost place.

   Few things in the retrospect of past intercourse and knowledge of each other among

nations widely separated are more remarkable than the continuous communication
across the whole breadth of Asia between east and west, which seems always to

have been maintained for purposes of traffic, from the earliest periods. No dangers

of the way, no physical oDstacles of luountain-ranges and great rivers or deserts,
no length of time nor ignorance of the geogTaphical bearings of any portion of this

area of so many thousand miles, seemed to have acted as deterrents. Even the
softly nurtured Venetian merchants were undismayed ; and Marco Polo's book of
his father's travels and his own abundantly proves that time must have borne a

very different value in those days to that which prevails in this century. In the

first journey to China we find they stayed one year at Sarai, on the Volga, and

another at Bokhara. It is true they found it difficult to get either backward or

forward, owing to the unsettled state of the country ; but this did not in any way

militate against their accepting an invitation, under a safe escort from the Envoys

--of Alan, the " Lord of the Levant," to proceed to the court of Kubliir Khan, in

China a journey which occupied.them a whole year. Whether the profits of any

successful venture were so enorm(jus as to afford adequate return for the time, or

the merchants of those days were so fond of adventure and exploration that they

were content -with less profit than modern commerce expects, I am not prepared to
say. But whatever may be the true explanation of this apparent diversity, we
may congratulate ourselves that each year many geographical explorations, accom-
panied as these now are by careful and scientific observations, and the immediate

registering of new facts in accurate collation with ,ill previously acquired data,
sensibly diminish the extent of unknown territory, and by so much not only facili-

tate the development of a constantly increasing commerce, but largely contribute to

the diminution of causes of national contention, in the application of treaties and

the determination of boundaries.

AVe have had several very striking examples of this within the past year ; and

although this is not the place to enter into the merits of the disputed questions

as to limits in any of the cases, I may be permitted to refer to them in general

                                                                                         i

terms as illustrations of the important service which geographical science is

enabled to render to Nations and to States in the higher Held of political combi-

nations and diplomatic negotiations. It has been well said that the surveyor is

likely to do more in future than soldiers to prevent war ; and the more frequently

the scientific geographer precedes negotiations, the less ground there will be for

--doubt or disputes about boundaries a most fertile subject of quarrel in all ages.

Is it not quite certain, for instance, that if accurate and complete surveys had been

made of the Straits between Vancouver's Island and the American coast, and

appended to the treaty of 1846, which was intended to settle the Oregon boundary,

with a line drawn exactly where it was intended the delimitation should take place

by the two negotiators, no dispute could have arisen ? It may have seemed enough

to define the north-west water boundary to be " a line drawn from the middle of the

channel which separates the Continent from Vancouver's Island southerly through

--the middle of the said Channel and of the Fuca Strait to the ocean," more espe-

cially, perhaps, as the existence of the De Haro and Rosario channels, about which

the dispute has arisen, was known to the negotiators. Yet how long and fierce the
contention has been between two great powers ! and though now peacefully decided,
we all know that it has for more than 25 years been one of those qitestions which

--might at any time have been a cause of war between two kindred nations, the

greatest calamity that could well befall either the one or the other.

The result of Sir Frederick Goldsmid's geographical labours in the east of Persia

during the past year has added another example of the inestimable political value

of accurate geographical surveys. In Asia more than any other country perhaps is

this necessity felt. Papers have been read at the Geographical Society describing

the journey of the Arbitration Commission from Bunder Abbas, through Kerman to

Seistan, and reporting fully on the districts which have been so long in dispute

between the Persian and Afghan governments. The line of delimitation between

the two coimtries has been decided by the labours of the Commission, and the last

Mymail from India announces its acceptance by both parties.  chief object in refer-

ring to it is to show the great and important services which not only may be, but

are actually rendered by geographical labours under able direction, and how much is

to be gained, both in the interests of peace and of science, from the adoption of a

practice of avoiding political complications by determining disputed lines of frontier

through the agency of mixed commissions and professional engineers. That it

should be generally adopted in the East must be the earnest desire alike of

feographers and statesmen, and converts to the principle are rapidly increasing,
  'he latest news from Constantinople brings the gratityiug intelligence that the

Sultan of Turkey and the Shah of Persia have mutually agreed to refer their

contentions about the boundaries between the two States to a mixed Commission

of this kind. The delimitation fixed by the British Government on the Upper
Oxus by similar action is a pledge of peace with Russia. These are so many

triumphs of an enlightened policy, by which disputed boundaries are settled, not by

the sword, but by geographical observation, the accuracy of which cannot be

contested. In this case it was rendered difficult, and all the more important

politically, because, as Colonel Yule has recently demonstrated, the whole geography

of the region of the Upper Oxus and surrounding country had been falsified

by Klaproth. In all the pseudo-travels that he invented he had imposed alike

upon the British and the Russian Governments ; and the consequences of such

falsification might have been most fatal, for it vitiated the maps of the Russian
Government, and with it their diplomacy. Fortimately our own information of

the geography of the trans-llimalayan regions had so much improved since Klap-

roth exercised his ingenuity, that it became possible not only to show where the
falsification existed, but how one great source of error had arisen. Colonel Yule
has proved, in a paper now published in the ' Transactions of the Geogi-aphical
Society,' how, by a certain square of the Chinese Map constructed in 1759 (which

was the groundwork of Klaproth's geographical knowledge) having been acci-

dentally turned round through an angle of 90", the mistake originated by which

the district of Wakhan for instance, instead of being laid down in the same parallel
as Badakhshan, was placed in the map (^100 miles to the northward, and thus

appeared to Prince Gortchalcoff to be conterminous with Kara-fef/iii.

   There is no nation, perhaps, which has so much reason to value geogi*aphical

science and the art of map-making at a high rate as the Russians. In their rapid
advance across the steppes and mountain-ranges of Northern Asia southward into
the valley of the Amoor and Manchuria on the east, and to Khiva and Samarcand
in the west, they have taken many courses ; but in all they have had the im-

mense advantage of not only knowing^ the territories they coveted, but being able
to place them accurately on maps. The late Mr. Atkinson, a great traveller in

Siberia and Central Asia, gives more than one graphic and, there is every reason to

believe, perfectly veracious account of how negotiations for territory with Asiatics
may be successfully and even peacefully conducted, at a very small cost when thus
aided and prepared. First an exploring party starts for some unknown region,
ostensibly, it may be, for hunting, well armed and prepared to note accurately the
physical features of any country they may traverse. The first exploration accom-

plished, a second follows, better provided for an actual survey and geological and
mineralogical researches. These being completed, negotiations are opened with

the chief of the tribe to whom the territory in question belongs. One of these

transactions in 1848 ended in a considerable district in the Kirghis Steppe, lying

between the Targ Abatai and the Irtisch, already ascertained to possess valuable
silver- and lead-mines, being transferred from the Sultan and chiefs of the Great
Horde of Kirghis to the Emperor of Russia (or, as he is better known to the

Kirghis, the " Great White Khan ") for a sum of 250 roubles, a gold medal, a sword

of honour, and half a dozen handsome khalats or robes for the Sultan, Mulla, and

the five or six head chiefs.

   In these mysterious and hitherto inaccessible regions of Inner or Central Asia,
geographical knowledge is almost a necessary qualification in any Power which

seeks further intercourse and access. To Russia, of course, it is matter of primary
importance, situated as she is in direct contact along all her southern border with

the nomade races which occupy the vast regions stretching across the continent

between her and all the southern ports and seas ; but scai-cely more so, perhaps,

--than to Great Britain, as another great Asiatic Power, the only one of equal

pretensions, strength, and influence in the East by its command of Western

Aresources and Asiatic territory.  knowledge of the geogiaphv of the regions

lying between the Caspian and the Amoor is, indeed, power of the most valuable

Innd. When the Russians secured possession of the upper portion of the Zarafshan

valley about Saware, they commanded the waters on which Bokhara depends for

its fertility and existence, and of com-se obtained a means of easy conquest. Thus,

whether for conquest or for commerce, Geography is the best ally and a necessary

pioneer. If we look again at the map, showing the complex systems of mountains

separating the plains of India from Eastern Turkestan and the upper tablelands

and valleys of Central Asia, we shall find that they are not simple ranges, like the
Alps or the Pyrenees, which can be crossed by a single pass, as Mr. Shaw has so
well shown, but are composed of many chains, enclosing considersible countries

within their valleys. Thibet and Cashmere are examples of this. Eleven passes,

we are told, have to be crossed in travelling from India to Turkestan ; and of these,
only two are lower than the summit of Mont Blanc. Yet, thanks to the labours
of many geographic explorers, impassable as these mountain-barriers seem, we

mknow now that they are penetrated such a manner by rivers, and so accessible by

comparatively easy routes, that they form no insurmountable obstacle to peaceful

commerce, although capable of a complete defence against force. Take, again, that

range of the Thian Shan to the north and the Himalayan system to the south,

which converge together as they run westward, and unite in a vast boss supporting
the high plateau of Pamir, which the natives call the Bam-i-dunya, or " Upper

floor of the World." Numerous valleys penetrate into it from east and from west,
  peculiarity which makes it far easier to traverse from east to west than from north

--to south a fact which you wiU see at once has a most important bearing on the

trade-routes.

The latest advance in this direction of Russia is fixed at present at Kulja, where

she has established an important trading centre. This has been obviously dictated
by a knowledge of geographical features giving her access to Eastern Turkestan

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

for although Kulja appears to be separated by difficult snowy mountains, yet these
Transactions of the sections.                                      155

are foimd to die away to the east ; and from that point Mr. Shaw tells us Russia

has it in her power to push her advance or her trade in two directions over level

country, either eastward to China, or westward to Turkestan.

Geography, it is clear, therefore, in these regions, is the right hand of Rulers and

of Generals, and determines alike the march of armies and the advance of merchants.

Nothing can be done by either without its aid. It is impossible, however, not to

admire the energy and indomitable spirit with which Russia, claimiog and freely

using all the assistance scientihc geography can give, utilizes the knowledge thus

secured. Mr. Shaw relates how the Muzat Pass, leading between Aksu and Kulja,

lies over a formidable glacier; and he was assured that forty men were kept at

work in the summer roughing the ice for the passage of the caravans. With such

a rival it must be evident, if we are to compete in the same iield with any success,

that both Government and merchants must put forth all their strength, and neither

be scared by physical obstacles nor daunted by expense and risks. This seems to

me the great lesson which all these accumulated facts convey. Geography has

shown the way, it is for merchants to follow, and Government, if need be, to aid

in removing olDstacles not otherwise to be overcome.

The connexion between historj' and geography, and the important bearing of

each upon the other, was scarcely recognized until the second half of the last cen-

tury, when several historical travellers gave, with their researches into the ancient

history of Greece and Western Asia, many details of physical geograph}', and

showed how essential a knowledge of these were to any perfect understanding of

the events taking place in the several localities. They must be studied together,

as the nature of the ground on which a battle has been fought, or a campaign

conducted, must be studied, to understand the movements of the contending forces

and the design of the leaders.

The late Dr. Arnold, in his lectures on history, insisted much upou the mutual

relations of history and geography, and the important light which a study of

physical geography throws upon the national conditions of life, social and political.

" The whole character of a nation," he observes, " may be influenced by its geology

and phj'sical geography. Again, geography holds out one hand to geology and

physiology, while she holds out the other to history. Both geology and physiology

are closely connected with history. The geological fact of England's superior rich-

ness in coal over every other country lay at the bottom of the corn-law question.

The physiological fact that the tea-plant was uncultivated in any other climate or

coimtry than China gave a peculiar interest to our relations with it." And it would

be easy to give many examples of this intimate connexion between geography and

history, and the mutual aid they afford.

  We have seen how possession of the head sources of the water supplies could

determine the fate of a country like Bokhara. And the distribution of river-courses

mainly determines the location of great populations, and the development of trade

and civilization by facilities of traffic and intercourse. Dr. Arnold, in the lectures

already quoted, gives an admirable illustration in dealing with the map of Italy,

which I cannot resist bringing under your notice.

The mere plan-geography of Italy shows a semicircle of mountains round the

northern boundary, and another long line stretching down the middle of the

Apennines. But let us look a little further, and give life and meaning to these

features, as Arnold delighted to do.

" Observe, in the first place, how the Apennine line, beginning from the southern

extremity of the Alps, runs across Italy to the very edge of the Adriatic, and thu8

separates naturally the Italy proper of the Romans from Cisalpine Gaul. Observe

again how the Alps, after running north and south, where they divide Italy from

France, turn then away to the eastward, running almost parallel to the Apennines,

till they too touch the head of the Adriatic on the confines of Istria. Thus,

between these two lines of mountains there is enclosed one great basin or plain,

enclosed on three sides by mountains, opening to the east to the sea. One great

river flows through it in its whole extent, and this is fed by streams almost un-

numbered descending towards it on either side, from the Alps on the one side and

Whofrom the Apennines on the other.   can wonder that this lai'ge and rich and

well-watered place should be filled with flourishing cities, or that it should havQ

                                                              11*
--156 « EEPORT 1873.

been coutended for so often by more poor invaders ? Then, descending into Italy

proper, we find tbe complexity of its geography quite in accordance with its

manifold political divisions. It is not one central ridge of mountains, leaving a

broad belt of level country on either side between it and the sea ; nor yet is it a

clear rising immediately from the sea on one side, like the Andes in South America,

leaving room therefore on the other side for wide plains of tableland, and for

rivers with a sufficient length of course to become at last great and navigable. It

is a backbone thickly set with spines of unequal length, interlacing with each other

in a maze almost inextricable. Speaking generally, then, Italy is made up of an

infinite midtitude of valleys pent in between high and steep hills, each forming a

country to itself, and cut off by natural barriers from the others. Its several parts

are isolated by nature, and no art of man can thoroughly unite them. Even the

various provinces of the same kiugdom are strangers to each other. The Abruzzi

are like an unknown world to the inhabitant of Naples." This is what Dr. Arnold

meant by a " real and lively knowledge of geography," which brings the whole

character of a country before our eyes, and enables us to understand its influence

upon the social and political condition of its inhabitants.

But such is the rapid progress of science and man's triumphs over nature, that

the tunnel through Mont Cenis, or Fell's railroad over it, and the railroad which

now pierces the Apennines and imites the eastern and western coasts of Italy,

aided by telegraphic wires, already falsify Arnold's conclusion that no art of man
can thoroughly unite regions so separated. And the infjuence these achievements

must have over the unification of Italj', and the progress of civilization throughout

the peninsula, can hardly be exaggerated.

Persia at the present day offers another striking illustration of the influence of

physical causes on the progress of civilization and the destiny of nations. Apart

irom the consequences of ages of misrule, its physical geography has exercised a

very adverse influence upon the country. Persia suffers from a great deficiency

of rainfall ; and although an immense supply of water comes from the mountains

by the rains and the melting of the snow, it is lost in the plains and wasted, if not

before, at least as soon as it reaches the great salt desert about twenty miles frona

Teheran. With the prevailing insufficiency of the rainfall on the plains them-

selves the whole country is becoming sterile ; but if the abundant supply from the

mountains could be intercepted before it reached the lower ground and collected

into reservoirs, it might then be distributed by irrigation over the whole face of

the land and play the same part as the Zarafshan or " Gold-scatterer" (so called for

its fertilizing powers) in the rich cidtivation of Bokhara. Perhaps this may not

prove beyond the power of Baron Renter to accomplish, aided by aU the science

and some of the capital of Europe. What further changes he may be enabled to

efl'ect by the introduction of railroads and telegraphic lines for facilitating trade

and rapid communication, we may soon be in a position to speak from actual

experience ; for it is stated in the public prints that the proposed railway between

Teheran and Resht is to be commenced at once, and that the plant has already
left England. More extended operations are, it is understood, contemplated to

--the south of Teheran to Ispahan, and from thence to the Persian Gulf perhaps

also to the Turkish frontier. The former will open a direct line to India, and the

latter to the Mediterranean, should the Turkish Government be willing to work in

Whoconcert.  can calculate the revolution in the whole aspect of the countiy

and its life-sustaining powers, if a whole series of such measures should be carried

through at once ?

   The part which Russia plays in the history of Europe and Asia, and the future
which may yet be reserved for that Empire, is more a matter of physical geo-

graphy than of politics or of policy, if we look to determining causes. What

cpuld Russia do, frozen in between two seas and with closed ports for more than
six months in each year, but, guided by an infallible instinct (often exemplified in

nations as in individuals), stretch out feelers towards the open waters and more
Wegenial climates ?
                     have heard much of Russia's destiny driving her southwards

to the B:isphorus, and eastward in the same parallel over the rich valleys of Central
and Tropic Asia ; but is it not a geographical necessity, far more than a political
ambition, which has thus far driven her across the whole breadth of Asia until she
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  157

gained the Chinese ports on the Pacific, and southwards towards the mouths of the
Danube, the sunny ports of the Mediterranean, and the head of the Persian Gulf?

Until unfrozen rivers and ports could be reached, how could her people make any pro-

--gress or develop their resources ? It not only was a natural tendency, as natural

as the descent of the glacier to the valleys, forging downwards by a slow but irre-

sistible pressure, but as inevitable. Obstacles may retard the progress, but not

arrest it ; and Russia is but following the course of nature as well as history in
f)ouring down nomade hordes and hardy Scythians on the cultivated territories
 ying in a more genial climate. Railroads and telegTaphic wires supply her with
means of transport and quick transit over vast spaces never enjoyed by her great
predecessors in this line of march. Let us hope, too, that more civilizing influ-
ences will follow her track, through regions never highly favoured in this respect,

than marked the passage of a Genghis Khan or a Timor. ' The Times ' observed
recently that it was one of the happiest coincidences in history that, just at the
time when the natural course of commercial and political development brings

Central Asia into importance, there should still exist in the eastern border of
Europe an empire retaining suflaciently the character of a military absolutism to

render it especially adapted for the conquest .and control of these semibarbarous

communities. I am not altogether prepared to accept this high estimate of Russian

ability and peculiar fitness for its self-imposed task, without qualification. That
Russia, Asiatic in origin and type, autocratic, and armed with all the power
which military science and discipline give, has some special fitness for the mission

it seems to accept as a destinj', I am not inclined to deny. But whatever may be

the decision arrived at on this head, it seems quite certain that as her progress in
arms gives her control over Central Asia, so will be the exclusion, by protective
or prohibitive tariffs, of all commerce but her own. It is only necessary to follow
on the map, and in the history of the successive advances southwards, the progress

made and the trade-routes established or extended within the last twenty years,
to be convinced that trade and exclusive rights of commerce are among the prin-
cipal objects which dictate the present policy of the empire. And, whatever may
be the designs of Russia in her advances on Central Asia, it must be clear by this
time that it is with her, and not with the nominal rulers of the States her armies
have overrun, that we must count in any steps we may take for the peaceful
prosecution of commerce. Strange and unexpected as are the reverses of fortune
which have befallen nations and empires in all ages, and great and complete as has
been the fall of many, there are few more striking than the interchange of parts
between the Muscovite and the Mongol dynasties. The time was, as Colonel Yule
remarks, when in Asia and Eastern Europe scarcely a dog might bark without
Mongol leave from the borders of Poland and the coast of Cilicia to the Amoor
and the Yellow Sea. As late as the 13th century the Moguls ravaged Hungary
and conquered Russia, which they held in subjection for many generations. Sarai
on the Volga was the scene of Chaucer's half-told tale of Cambuscan, when

                                " At Sarra in the Londe of Tartarie
                                  There dwelt a King that werried Eussie."

   The times have changed indeed since then, and the successors and descendants of
those same Moguls and Tartars have another tale to tell now, at Khiva and Peking.

   Before I pass from this part of my subject, I would draw your attention to the

vast field which yet remains in Asia for geogTaphical research and exploration.
The intimate connexion between such labours and the development of our commerce
in the trans-Himalayan countries must have been made abundautly evident ; and

I would fain hope there will never be any want of competent volunteers (who may
rival ]\Ir. Shaw and Mr. Ney Elias, both distinguished and adventurous pioneers
taken from mercantile pursuits) to show the way for others. Notwithstanding all

difficulties and opposing influences, physical and political, there appears to be a
large field for our commerce, and one capable of almost infinite expansion, where

enterprise, skill, and industry may fairly count upon a good return.
   As regards costly efibrts in opening roads, it may perhaps seem doubtful to the

Indian as to the Imperial Government, how far either would be justified in any

large outlay. Nothing, however, is more to be regretted than doubt or hesitation

for the markets once monopolized by tlie Russians, we may seek in vain to open

them to general trade at any later period. It is difficult to calculate how much we

should lose ; for the distance from the Indus to Vernoje and Kopal, two of the most

recent markets of Central Asia founded bj' the Russians, is about one third of tliat

from these places to the gi-eat fair of the Volga. Commercially this is of great

importance, as these towns will become the centres whence the Tartar merchants

will send forth ,their agents to disperse the goods among all the Kirghis of the

Steppes. From these points they wiU also go to the Mongolian tribes, on the north
of the Gobi ; and this region, Mr. Atkinson assures us, contains a vast population. He

even anticipates that, should such a trade be established, the merchandise mil find

its way through the country of the Kalkas into Davuaria, and to the regions beyond

the Selenga and the sources of the Amoor, where it may advantageously compete

with goods brought up the latter river ; nor will the Siberians fail to avail them-

selves of its advantages. Whenever there shall be fairs on the Indus or beyond

the passes of the Himalayas on the borders of Sikkim or Thibet, the Kirghis wiU

send into India vast numbers of good horses annually. Silver and gold, the same

traveller saj's, is pleutifid in their countrj', and their other resources will in all pro-

bability be rapidly developed. The best mode of opening such a trade with Central

Asia beyond question will be by fairs, or great marts, similar to Kiachta on the

frontier between China and Russia, Irkutzk and Urga, and more recently at Irbit

by the Russians. On this point we have also Mr. Atkinson's very decided opinion.
He says, speaking of such fairs, " This I deem preferable to the English plan of

consigning goods to agents either in Yarkand, Kokhan, or Tarshkend. Once these

fairs are established, the Tartar and other merchants will attend and purchase

the necessary articles for the people among whom they vend their wares. These

men are thoroughly acquainted with the tribes and know all their wants. Tliey are

industrious and energetic in their calling, travelling over thousands of miles. They
know every part of the country, and where to find the tribes in all seasons of the

year ; and it is by them that Russia distributes her merchandise over Central Asia.
Wherever trade can be carried on at a profit, experience has shown that all natural

obstacles have been sunnounted by these hardy sons of the Steppe. It is well to

have such commercial agents and distributors as allies and customers, whereas any

attempt to locate English agents in their midst would create jealousy and excite

fears lest thej' should lose their legitimate profits. Far greater dangers are encoun-

tered by caravans which travel from Kulja into the interior provinces of China than

they will meet with between Yarkand, Kashgar, and the Indus." All that is re-

quired is to bring the goods from the plains of India through the passes to the

border                                   and steps to this end are being actively taken in more than one direction.
                                      ;

In 1850 Lord Dalhousie sanctioned the commencement of a road, which, leaving

the plains in the neighbourhood of Ivalka, 36 miles from Umballah, should ascend

to Simla and thence towards Thibet, through the temperate valley of the Sut-

ledge, to Shipki on the Thibetan border. In the next five years this Hindostan

and Thibet road, which was to unite India with Central Asia, had made such

progress, that 115 miles of six-feet road  had been  completed                                                    and  it was  anti-
                                                                                                               ;

cipated that by the following spring but 25 miles would remain of unfinished

v/ork between Simla and China, and 60 between Simla and the frontiers of

C!hina._ I regret to state that later accounts show the work to have been stopped;
and this seems to be matter for deep regret, both on account of the large unproductive

expenditure incurred for a work stopped short of completion, and the urgent necessity

there is for secure access to the trans-Himalayan regions, while there is yet room

for competition with Russian trade and influence. One of the great questions of
the hoiir is, how best and most expeditiously to open up practicable roads from

the plains of India to Central Asia, on the west to Turkestan, and eastwards to

the borders of Thibet, and perhaps by British Burmah across the Shan States to the
western provinces of China. But access to the markets of Central Asia is by far the
most urgent and important ; for, as I will presently show, the southern route through
Burmah, were all difficulties overcome (and they are neither few nor slight), pro-
mises little in comparison vrith a more direct outlet for the Assam teas, and an

interchange of goods and produce with the popidations of Thibet, Tm-kestan, and
Central Asia generally. Across the Himalayan barrier it appears there is a choice
                                                                     TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  159

of more than one or two practicable passes ; that through Sikkini to the vicinity
of Thibet offers the fewest difficulties, and in every respect promises the most

speedy results with a moderate outlay. Other routes to the west, leading to

Badafeshan, and one by Ladak to Turkestan (where we have already an energetic

and enterprising British representative in Mr. Shaw), and through the valley and

passes of the Chitral, are beset by many difficulties, physical and political, though not
more than a powerful Government like India may surmount. It has been said

that if the Russians had such a question to deal with, the solution would not be

long delayed                                                    and  no doubt  they have solved some more arduous problems in the

present generation. The enterprise, vigour, and perseverance which mark all their

proceedings where the extension of their commerce or their dominion and influ-

ence over Asia from Peking to Constantinople (and especially towards the Khanates

of Central Asia) are concerned, may leave us far behind in the race, and render
them formidable adversaries, notwithstanding their merchants are weighted with

distances so vast, that the 700 miles from the Indus to the other side of the

Himalayas sink into insignificance. But I am not inclined to join in any con-
demnation of our own Government, without taking into consideration the inherent

difficulties of the task, because they have not moved hitherto more rapidlj' in this

direction. As regards access by Sikkim there ought to be both decision and

prompt action. It is a protected state, and a late despatch of the Lieut.-Governor

of Bengal to the Secretary to the Government of India expresses a hope to be

able to connect the frontier mart at Dewangiri, once a very active trade-mart for

the Tibetans and other adjoining districts, with the plains of India by a good

road this next cold season. He considers it possible "to have a much easier,
pleasauter, and more profitable communication with High Asia by this way than

further west;" and speaks very decidedly as to the uselessness of any right of

passage or trade through Nepaul or Bhootan. There seems every hope, therefore,

that within a few months something effective will be done to open a trade-route

through Sikkim and make the passes practicable. All that seems to be required is

a branch railroad from the other side of the Kooshteen, where the Eastern Bengal

Railway touches the Ganges, on through fertile Rimgpore to the foot of the hills,

and a road through the pass to the border, where a fair could be established and a

trading station maintained.

   Any direct access beyond the Thibetan border can only, in the present con-
dition of affairs, be obtained by diplomatic action at Peking. The Chinese

Government have hitherto created all the obstacles ; and there is the greater

reason for pressing a less restrictive policy upon the Chinese, that at the head of

the Assam valley the Mishmi country communicates with Batang, a dependency of
tlie Szechuen Province of China ; and access to this point thi-ough the border would
be a much more effective mode of tapping the south-western pro\'inces of China

than any routes through Burmah to "i unnan. Now that the Emperor's minority

is at an end, and the Regency with it, the time would seem favourable for a strong
and decided eflbrt at Peking to remove the obstruction created by the jealous and
restrictive policy of the Chinese rulers. But while Chambers of Commerce and
Merchants are urging Her Majesty's Government to incur both outlay of money
and grave political responsibilities for the furtherance of trade and the opening of

new markets for om- manufactures, it is necessary that they should be prepared to

--do their own part, and push boldly forward with their goods as soon as access can

be gained ^because any doubt on this head must necessarily tend to paralyze the
efforts of a Government by the fear of working in vara. One cause of hesitation
about the continuance of the magnificent work commenced by Lord Dalhousie in
·1850, by which a great road was to be made from the plains to Shipki on the

borders of Thibet, may have been certain doubts expressed by merchants as to any

trade taking that route.

   But I must not detain you longer. I will only glance at the projects for opening
a trade by railway between Burmah and South-western China. The one route, so
long advocated by Captain Spry, would cross over from Rangoon to Kianghung on
the Meikong; and another, recommended by Colonel Fytche when Chief Com-

missioner of British Burmah, would extend from Rangoon to Prome, with a view

to opening a trade ma Bhamo.
--160 REPORT 1873.

Many memorials have "been sent during past yeais to the Home Government to

urge tlie  undertaking  of the first  of  these  for  the  benefit  of  trade                        but I am not
                                                                                                  ;

aware that, important as the merchants liave deemed it, the matter has ever been

pressed on the Government by any Member of Parliament in the House of Com-

mons, and I doubt very much such a line proving remunerative. Yunnan, so

far from being, as described by some of the memorialists, both populous and pro-
ductive, has been reduced to a desert waste by the civil war and the destruction

of the Mahomedans, and for long years to come there can be little hope of com-

mercial activity. It can scarcely be expected, therefore, that either the Imperial

or the Indian Government will imdertake to make such a railroad themselves, or
to guarantee the interest for others. A« regards the Government of India, it has

always held, I think, of late years that the Indian revenue could not justly be

charged with the cost of an enterprise which, however successful, could only

benefit English trade, and very indirectly, if at all, Burmah. If any guarantee is

necessary, therefore, it seems clear it must come from the Imperial and not from
the Indian Government. There is one other consideration : recent news show that

the French in Cochin China have by no means given up the hope of drawing. any
trade to bo developed with the south-west of China by a much more direct and

river-route to a port in the Gulf which they have recently secured for their own

benefit. Although the French have not usually proved formidable rivals in Eastern

trade, it is possible that, with such advantage of geographical situation, water-

carriage, and proximity, they might seriously check any development of trade in a

less favoured course.

Before concluding I must give you some information as to the papers which are

likely to occupy your attention during this session.

Dr. J. McCosh will read a paper on an overland communication between India

and China, a subject which he is qualified to pronounce an opinion upon, having

made it his study for upwards of thirtj^ years. As long ago as 1836, whilst

serving in Assam, he furnished the Government with an official report, in which

he pointed out the facility of connecting India and China by a grand trimk road

and he read a paper on the same subject before the Royal Geographical Society

in 1860. He advocates the Munnipore route.
   Mr. Ney Elias contributes a paper " On Trade-Routes through Mongolia and

Zungaria." He gained the Royal Medal of this year from the Royal Geographical

Society for his adventurous journey in 1872, as a private traveller, over the countries

described in his paper, and is well known as an accomplished traveller, taking

observations for laying down his route with rare completeness. He states in his
paper that the only trade-route now open between Central Asia and Western China

is that through Mongolia.

   Mr. J. Thomson will read a paper on the Yang-tsze as an artery of communi-
cation. Mr. Thomson has been long before the public as a successful traveller and

accomplished photographer of the scenery of distant countries. Some years ago he

visited the marvellous ruins of temples and cities in Cambodia, and published a
magnificent work on the subject, illustrated by photographs. Since then he has

visited China and Formosa, and is publishing, in parts, a work of a similar cha-

racter to his former one on Cambodia.

   I believe Mr. Thomson will bring a set of photographs for exhibition.
   Baron Eichthofen will read a paper " On the Distribution of Coal in China."

  He will perhaps read a second paper on the general subject of his travels. He

is one of the most accomplished of Chinese travellers, and has traversed pro-

bably the largest extent of country. His published Report to the Committee of
the Shangai Chamber of Commerce on his Explorations in the Provinces of Chili,

Shansi, Shensi, and Sz'chuen is fidl of the most interesting information regarding

Hethe physical geograph}-, resources, and products of the interior of China.

is present at the Meeting, one of the distinguished foreign savcms invited by the
town and the Association.

   Capt. J. E. Davis will read a paper on the results so far of the voyage of the

' Challenger.' Capt. Davis was a member of Ross's great expedition towards the

South Pole, and by his position in the Hydrographical or Scientific branch of the
Admiralty is well qualified to deal with such' a subject. The public have been
          TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  161

informed from time to time of tlie results of the deep-sea soundings and dredgings of

tlie ' Challenger,' but Capt. Davis will supply by far the completest information.

  The Kev. W. Wyatt Gill will give us an account of " Three visits to New

Guinea." Mr. Gill, after twenty-two years spent in missionary life in the South

Pacific, spent a short time at the mission stations in Torres Straits, and visited the

--mainland of New Guinea.
   Recent Arctic Explorations. The Spitzbergen and the Smith Sound routes are

tlie two great rival highways of exploration towards the arctic basin, and discovery
has alternately pushed nearer the pole by the one and the other. Till recently the
Spitzbergen route held the palm, for by it ships had reached to beyond the 81st
parallel, whilst on the American side no ship had been able to force a passage
higher than the 79th degree of latitude ; but in 1872 the American expedition, led
by Capt. Hall, who has perished in the cause, making its way northward by Smith
Sound, attained the highest point yet reached by ships, the latitude of 82° 16' N.,

or to within 420 miles of the North Pole. Two expeditions, one from Austria the

other from Sweden, are also in progress on the Spitzbergen side. The Austrian,
under the leadership of Weybrecht and Payer, has passed beyond the limits of the
remotest traffic into the unknown seas to the north of Siberia, and it is probable
that no news of this voyage may reach civilized Europe for many months. The
Swedish voyage had for its object to move northward by sledges from the Parry

group of islands in the north of Spitzbergen, but has failed completely in this often-
tried scheme, and spent the past winter at Morrel Bay, on the coast of the chief
island of Spitzbergen. Early in the spring of this year another fruitless attempt

was made to go north over the hummocked ice. Desisting unwillingly from these

useless cllbrts, the sledge party turned along the coast of the north-east land of
Spitzbergen to its extreme eastern point, and thence ascending the high inland ice,

made a difficult passage across to Ilinloper Strait, from whence the winter-quarters

of the ship were again reached.

   With regard to British enterprise in the Arctic regions there is little to report.

Since the termination of the long series of brilliant exploits in the Polar regions at

the end of the search after Sir John Franklin, England seems to have abandoned

Athe field to rival nations.  few private expeditions to the Spitzbergen seas,

notably those of Mr. Leigh Smith, who has again visited those regions this summer,

alone represent British activity in tlie Arctic seas. However, the Roj'al Geo-

graphical Society does not allow the matter to .slumber. An endeavour was

made last winter to induce the Government to send out another expedition;

and at the present time a joint Committee of the Royal and the Royal Geo-

graphical Societies is at work formulating a plan of action with a view to

representing to Government the urgency of despatching an expedition in 1874.

 --Africa. Of Dr. Livingstone and Sir Samuel Baker no fresh news has been

received beyond what has been before the public. Two expeditions are now

on their way to Central Africa in search of Livingstone and to cooperate with

him. The Congo Expedition at last date (April 3) had reached Bembe, ].30 miles

from the coast, in admirable order. The East Coast Expedition had reached
Rehenneko, 120 miles, but -(\dth the loss of one of the party, Mr. ISloftat, who died

near Simbo. Their plan was to reach Tanganyika, and finish the exploration of

that lake, until Livingstone was met with. I had hoped to have seen Sir Samuel

Baker here, that we might hear from his own lips and in fuller detail what he

has accomplished. I do not quite despair yet; but up to the present hour I have

had no communication from him since his arrival at Cairo on his homeward

journey.

           On the true Position and Physical Characters of Mount Sinai.

                       By Chakles T. Beke, Ph.D., F.E.G.S.

   The identification of Mount Sinai is still uncertain. Though the great mountain-
mass within the peninsula between the Gulfs of Suez and .^kaba is generally
looked on as containing the " Mount of God," it has hitherto been found imprac-
162 REPORT-- 1873.

ticaMe to fix on any one of its lofty peaks as being incontestably the true Mount

Sinai. The Ordnance Survey of the peninsula recently completed, however ahly

performed, has failed to remove the doubts and difficulties attending the subject,

which have thrown discredit on the truth of the Bible history ; for, though the

topography of the peninsula has thereby been definitively settled, the relative

importance of the various localities and their bearing on the Scripture narrative

continue just as uncertain as ever.

According to Dr. Beke, the cause of this uncertainty is obvious. The primary

question ought not to be whether this peak or the other peak within the penin-

sula has the greater claim to be considered the true Mouut Sinai, but whether

they are any of them entitled to that distinction. In his work ' Origines Biblicpe,'

published in 1834, he contended that Mount Sinai is nowhere within that penin-

sula ; and in the present paper he adduces proofs that this mountain is in reality a

Harmvolcano, now extinct, situate within the  Riuljld, a region of igneous origin,

situate on the western side of the Scriptural " Land of Midian," now the great

Arabian desert, and at no great distance to the east of the head of the Gulf of

Akaba, or Sea of Edom, which (and not the Gulf of Suez) he looks on as the Red

--Sea through which the Israelites passed on their exodus from the Lantl of

Bondage the Mitzraim of Scripture not being identical with the Egypt of the

Ptolemies, but lying altogether towards the north-east of it, in proximity to the

country of the Philistines.

At the time of the Exodus Mount Sinai was in a state of eruption, the smoke

and flame from its crater being described by the sacred historian as " by day a

pillar of a cloud, and by night a pillar of tire," just as the poet Pindar speaks of
Mount Etna as pouring forth " by day a burning stream of smoke, but by night a

ruddy eddying flame ; " and the volcano was not extinct in the time of the prophet

Elijah, six centuries later.

   Dr. Beke traces the route of the Israelites from Rameses to Succoth, and thence

to Etham, which he identifies with the Wady Yetoum or Ithem of the present
day, a side valley of the Wady Arabah, at the head of the Gulf of Akaba. From

Etham the Israelites turned, and (as Dr. Beke reads the Hebrew text of Exodus
xiv. 21) they encamped " before the mouths of the caverns, between the castle

and the sea, over against its north end," the Castle thus mentioned being now

represented by the Castle of Akaba at the north end of the Gulf. And after the

Israelites had passed through the sea, their further route is traced to jNIarah, Elim,

and again to the sea-coast at the entrance to the Gulf of Akaba ; whence they

proceeded in the direction of JMount Sinai, being guided by the pillar of a cloud

and the pillar of fire during this portion of their journey, as they had been in that
between Succoth and Etham. For a detailed statement of his views Dr. Beke
referred to his pamphlet, ' Mount Sinai a Volcano,' recently published. In con-
clusion he expressed his desire to visit the volcanic region to the east of the head
of the Gulf of Akaba, where he places the true Mount Sinai, for the purpose of

verifying and completing his identification of that " holy ground," and so putting
an end, once and for ever, to the doubts and difficulties that have so long existed

respecting this the most venerable spot on the face of the earth ; and it not being

in his power to perform so costly a journey at his own expense, he expressed his
confident hope of support from those interested in the settlement of so momentous

a question.

      On the Physical Geociraphy of the Deserts of Persia and Central Asia.
                        By W. T. Blanfoed, F.G.S., C.M.Z.S.

   The deserts of Persia consist of vast plains of aUuvium, usually much longer than

they are broad, sm-rouuded on all sides by higher OTound, and "in several instances

having a portion of theii- surface covered "by salt. No river emerges from any part

of the Persian plateau. All the rain which faUs is evaporated or absorbed. Most
of the streams from the hills which sm-round the central plateau terminate in salt
marshes. or salt lakes ; but there are two remarkable exceptions, the lake or marsh
of Seistan receiving the Helmund river and the lake of Jotcha, which is in Russian
territory : both of these are fresh;
                   TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                      1:6S

   It appears probable that the alluvial desert plains have been formed in lakes which

existed -when the rainftxll was greater than it now is. Around the borders of the de-

serts are remarkable slopes of coarse gravel, formed probably of material washed from
the surrounding hills. But the great depressions of the country must have been
formed under diflerent meteorological conditions, and were probably at one time

river-valleys closed by the elevation of ranges of hiUs in the later Tertiai-y period
accompanied by a decrease in the rainfall. The desiccation of the coimtry has pro-
bably been gradual ; it is possible that in historic times the rainfall was greater than
it now is, and that the former population of the country was larger. The change
has in all probability been gradual from river-valleys to enclosed lakes and from

lakes to deserts.

It appears probable that a similar change has taken place throughout a large por-

Ation of Central Asia.  large part of Central and Western Asia, from the Black

Sea to Thibet, closely resembles Persia in its physical characters ; and the diying-up

of the lower course of the Oxus may have been primarily connected with the

diminution of the river due to the decrease in the supply from rain.

On the Physical Geogmpliy of the Mediterranean, considered in relation to
  that of the Blade Sea and the Caspian. By William B. Cakpenxer,

   M.D., LL.D., F.E.S.

   Taking as his datum the equality between the evaporation from the surface of

the Caspian Sea, and the amount of fresh water returned to it by rain and rivers
(see p. KJo), the author showed the applicability of this datum to prove the

cori'ectness of Dr. Halley's doctrine, that the surface in-current of the Strait of

--Gibraltar is due to the excess of evaporation in the Mediterranean area a doc-

trine which has been recently called in question by Prof. Huxlej^, who has ex-

pressed the opinion that, looking to the enormous amount of fresh water poured
into this basin by the rivers which discharge themselves into it, " the sun must
have enough to do to keep the Mediterranean down." The area of the Black Sea
(including the Sea of Azov) and that of the Caspian are nearly equal, each being
estimated at about 180,000 square miles. They lie for the most part between the

same annual isotherms of 60° and 50°, the extensions of the Caspian to the south

of the former and to the north of the latter being nearly equal ; and hence we may
conclude that the evaporation from the two seas is nearly the same. Now, as the

whole water of the \olga and of the other rivers that empty themselves into the
Caspian is only sufficient to make up for its evaporation, it is obvious that the con-

tribution of the Danube, the Dnieper, the Dniester, the Don, and other rivers that

empty themselves into the Black Sea, towards the supply of the MediteiTanean, is

--only the excess which remains after compensating for the evaporation of the Black

gea or (assimiing the equality of this with the evaporation of the Caspian) the
excess of the volume of the Black-Sea rivers over that of the Caspian rivers, which
 (as will presently appear) must be a very insignificant contribution to the Medi-

terranean in comparison with the area of the latter.

   How small that excess reallj^ is, may be gathered from the experiments on the

Dardanelles and Bosphorus cm-rents, of which the particulars have elsewhere been

given (p. 41). For not only is the outward surface-current extremely variable

in its rate, and liable to occasional reversal, but, when it is at its strongest, its
effect is most counteracted by the inward vmdercurrent. The proportional force
 and volume of the two currents cannot be estimated from these experiments with
anv thing like certainty; but Captain Wharton thinks that the undercm-rent
sometimes carries in as much as two thirds of the water that the suri'ace-cm-rent
 carries out. That it ordinarily returns at least half, may be fairly inferred from

 the constant maintenance of the average salinity of the Black-Sea water at about
 half that of Mediterranean water ; since it is obvious that this proportion could

 not be kept up unless as much salt re-enters the basin by the undercurrent as
 passes out of it by the upper. Hence, as the salinity of the undercurrent is twice
 that of the upper, its volume may be taken at about one half; so that the actual

 excess of outflow will be only about one half of the volume of water that forms the
--164i
REPORT 1873.

surface-current. And thus the whole contribution of the great rivers th.at discharge

themselves into the Black Sea, to the maintenance of the level of the Mediterra-
jiean, is represented by an outflow through the Dardanelles by no means exceed-

ing the amount brought down by a single considerable river.
   AVe now turn to the Mediterranean, and shall again use the Caspian as a basis

on which we may form some kind of approximative estimate as to the proportion

between the evaporation from its surface and the return by river-flow.
   In the first place, the area of the Mediterranean, including the JEgQ&n and the

Adriatic, is between four and Jive times the present area of  the Caspian                                                 so that,
                                                                                                                       ;

taking the evaporation over equal areas of the two seas to be the same, the quan-

tity of return that would be needed to keep up the level of the Mediterranean

would be between four and five times as great as that which suffices to maintain

that of the Caspian. But looking to the fact that the principal part of the area

of the Mediterranean lies east and west between the parallels of 32° and 40° N. lat.,

whilst that of the Caspian lies north and south between the parallels of 36° and

46°, it seems obvious that this difference alone would cause the evaporation of the

Mediterranean to be much greater for equal areas than that of the Caspian. The

ordinary summer temperature of a considerable part of the eastern basin of the

Mediterranean is not much below 80° : Dr. Carpenter has himself seen it ranging

from 75° to 80° between Malta and jVlexandria in the early part of October. And,

notwithstanding the curious northern bend by which the summer isotherm of 80°

is carried through Greece"and Asia Minor, along tlie southern shore of the Black

Sea, it only just touches the southern basin of the Caspian, the summer tempera-

ture of nearly the whole of this sea being below that of the northernmost parts of
the Mediterranean. The difference is far greater, however, during the winter

months. Taking the lowest winter temperature of the Mediterranean at Prof.

Huxley's aver.ige of 48° (and Dr. Carpenter has reason to believe that this is some

degrees too low for the eastern basin, whilst it is not at all too high for the

western), we find the January mean of the Caspian to range from 40° at its

southern extremity to 30° in its middle basin, while its] northern b.asin is crossed

by the January isotherm of 20°. Hence, as regards temperature alone, the mean

--annual excess is largely on the side of the Mediterranean. But there is another

element not less important the extreme dryness of the hot winds which blow over

the Mediterranean ( especially its eastern basin) from the great African deserts, and

which take up an enormous amount of moisture in their course.

  We should not be far wrong, then, in assuming that, to counteract this enormous

evaporation, the volume of river-water poured into the Mediterranean ought to be
at least six times that received by the Caspian. But what is the actual amount of
that supply ? Along tlie whole Africancoast, from the Strait of Gibraltar to the
Nile, there is nothing that can be called a large river. Around the whole Levant

there is the same deficiency. And thus, with the exception of the Nile and of the
Po (a slow-flowing river of very moderate volume), no great body of water is

poured into the eastern basin of the Mediterranean, save the overflviv of the Black

bea, which comes down through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles. How small a

contribution is made by this overflow to the maintenance of the general level of

the MediteiTanean, seems apparent from the fact that the specific gravity of the

water of the ^gean, with which it first mingles, is scarcely, if at all, lowered by
the intermixture of the half-salt stream which discharges itself into the part of it
most remote from its communication with that larger basin. Into the western

basin of the Mediterranean no other considerable rivers discharge themselves than

the Rhone and the Ebro. Thus the sum total of the supply brought into the
whole Mediterranean area by great rivers may be expressed by the Nile, one half
of the Dardanelles surface-current, the Po, the Rhone, and the Ebro. And if we
add to these the " ten submarine springs of fresh water which are known to burst
up in the Mediterranean," it seems perfectly clear that we cannot make that total

any thing like six times the amount which is brought into the Caspian by the
Volga, the Ural, and the Transcaucasian rivers, and which has been shown to be

cntireJy dissipated hy evajmration. It has been estimated by two French officers,

MM. Regy and Vigan*, who have recently compared the probable evaporation of

tlie Mediterranean with the rainfall over its area, that the annual excess of the

former represents a stratum of 4^ feet ; and the largest estimate of the amount

brought in by rivers cannot make up a third of this quantity*.      "l

With such an adequate vera causa as this enormous excess of evaporation, there

is no occasion to go in search of any other explanation for the Gibraltar in-current.
For it is obvious that if the " marine water-shed " between Capes Trafalgar and

Spartel were to be raised 1000 feet, so as to cut off the Mediterranean basin from

the Atlantic, the excess of evaporation from its surface would produce a pro-

gressive reduction of its level (as has happened with the Caspian), until its area

came to be so far restricted as to limit its evaporation to the amount returned to it

by rain and rivers. But so long as this communication remains open, so long will

an in-current through the Strait of Gibraltar maintain the present level and area

of the Mediterranean. That this in-current persists through the winter (which is

advanced by Prof. Huxley as an objection to the received doctrine) is easily

explained. The temperature of the surface, though reduced to 50 degrees or there-

iibouts, is still sufficiently high (especially under dry African winds) to maintain a

considerable amount of evaporation ; and it is during the season of this reduced

evaporation that the river-supply is least ; for all the great rivers which dis-

charge themselves into the Mediterranean basin are at their lowest during the

winter months, their upper sources being then frozen up, and it is with the

melting of the snows that they become filled again.

On the Physical Geography of the Caspian Sea, in its relations to Oeologyf.

               By William B. Carpenter, M.D., LL.D., F.R.S.

The object of this communication was to make known the most important of

the fticts contained in the Report of Prof, von Baer on the Physical Geography of

--the Caspian these facts having a special interest for Geologists, and affording also

a reliable datum in regard to the relation between the amount which is lost by

surface-evaporation and that which is returned by rain and rivers.

The Caspian, which is the largest existing Inland Sea without any outlet, is a

" survival " of that gi-eat central sea which, at no remote geological period,

covered a large part of Northern Asia ; the gradual upheaval of the land having

separated it from the Euxine on the one side, and from the Sea of Aral on the

other, as well as from the Arctic Sea, Avitli which this marine province was

Howformerly in communication.        small an elevation has sufficed to cut off this

communication on the northern side, is shown by the fact, that the connexion of

the Dwina with the Volga by a system of canals has opened a way for vessels to

pass between the Caspian and the White Sea. Thus remaining isolated in the

midst of land, the Caspian has undergone a series of very remarkable changes,

which can be distinctly traced out.

In the first place, it is evident (as was long since pointed out by Pallas) that

the former extent of the Caspian was much greater than its present area. Tlie

southern portion of its basin, which lies among mountains whose escarpments

extend beneath the water, is by far the ^deepest, a large part of its bottom lying

between 2000 and .3000 feet below the present surface of the water. The middle

portion has also a considerable depth on the Caucasian side. But the northern

portion is nowhere more than 50 feet deep ; and this depth is continually being

reduced by the alluvial deposits brought down by the rivers which discharge them-

selves into this part of the basin, notably the Volga and the Ural. These rivers

run through an immense expanse of steppes, the slope of which towards the

Caspian is almost imperceptible ; so that if the level of its waters were to be

raised even very slightly, an expanse of land at least equal to its present area

would be covered by it. Now, as the present level is about SO feet helorj that of

the Black Sea, whilst ample evidence that the steppes were formerly overflowed

by salt water is afforded by beds of marine shells, as well as by the persistence of

   * Sir John Herschel, adopting somewhat different data, came to a conclusion essentially
the same (' Physical Geography,' p. 27).

166 REPORT--1873.

numerous salt lakes and salt marshes, there can be no question that the northern

basin of the Caspian formerly extended over the whole plain of the Volga below

Saratov ; and no other cause can be assigned for its contraction, than the excess of
evaporation over the ret\irn of water hy rain and rivers.

   But such a reduction in the volume of water as must have taken place in order

to produce this lowering of level would have shown itself, it might be supposed,
in an increase of its salinity ; whereas the fact is that the proportion of salt (which

varies in different parts of the basin, and also at different seasons) is on the average

only about owe fourth of that which is found in oceanic water, and does not much

exceed one half of the proportion contained in the water of the Euxine. This

reduction, however, is fully explained by the observations of Von Baer, who traces

it to the number of shallow lagoons by which the basin is surrounded, every one

of which is a sort of natural " salt pan " for the evaporation of the water and the

deposit of its saline matter in the solid form. This process may be well studied in
the neighboui'hood of Novo-Petrosk on the eastern coast, where what was
formerly a bay is now divided into a large number of basins, presenting every

degree of saline concentration. One of these still occasionally receives water from

Athe sea, and has deposited on its banks only a very thin layer of salt.  second,

likewise full of water, has its bottom hidden by a thick crust of rose-coloured

Acrystals like a pavement of marble.  third exhibits a compact mass of salt, in

which are pools of water whose surface is more than a yard below the level of the

sea. And a fomlh has lost all its water by evaporation, and the stratum of salt

Aleft behind is now covered by sand.  similar concentration is taking place in the

arm of the sea termed Karasu (Black Water), which nms southwards from the

nOrth-east angle of the Caspian ; for, notwithstanding the proximity of the mouths
of the great rivers, the proportion of salt there rises so gi-eatly above that of the

ocean, that animal life, elsewhere extremely abimdant, is almost or altogether

suppressed.

This process goes on upon the greatest scale, however, in the Ivaraboghaz

a shallow diverticulum from the eastern part of the middle basin, which is pro-
bably a " survival " of the former communication between the Caspian and the Sea

of Aral. This vast gulf communicates with the sea by a narrow mouth, which is

not more than about 150 yards wide and 5 feet deep ; and through this channel
a current is always running inwards with an average speed of three miles an hour.

This current is accelerated by westerly and retarded by easterly winds; but it

never flows with less rapidity than a mile and a half per hour. The navigators of
the Caspian, and the l\irLoman nomads who wander on its shores, struck with the

constant and unswerving course of this current, have supposed that its waters pass

down into a subterranean abyss (Karaboghaz, black gulf), through which they

reach either the Persian Gulf or the Black Sea. For this hypothesis, however,
there is not the least foundation. The basin, being exposed to every wind and to
most intense summer heat, is subject to the loss of an enormous quantity of water

by evaporation ; and as there is very little direct return by streams, the deficit can
only be supplied by a flow from the Caspian. The small depth of the bar seems to

prevent the return of a coimter-cm-rent of denser water, none such having been

detected, although the careful investigations made by Von Baer would have shown
its presence if it really existed. And thus there is a progressively increasing con-

centration of the water witliin the basin of the Karaboghaz ; so that seals v/hich

used to frequent it are no longer found there, and its borders are entirely destitute

of vegetation. Layers of salt are being deposited on the mud at the bottom ; and
the sounding-line, when scarcely out of the water, is covered with saline crystals.

Taking the lowest estimates of the degree of saltness of the Caspian water, the

width and depth of the channel, and the speed of the cm-rent, Von Baer has shown

that the Karaboghaz alone daily receives from the Caspian the enormous quantity

of three hundred andfifty thousand tons of salt. If such an elevation were to take
place of the surface of the bar as should separate the Karaboghaz from the basin

of the Caspian, it would quickly diminish in extent, its banks would be converted

into immense fields of salt, and the sheet of water which might remain would be

either converted into a shallow lake, like Lake Elton, which is 2C0 miles from

--the present northern border of the Caspian or a salt marsh, like those which

--<5over extensive tracts of the steppes or might altogether disappear by dn'ing

lip, as seems to have been the case with a depressed area lying between Lake
Elton and the River Ural, which is 79 feet below the level of the Caspian, and
about as much more below that of the Black Sea. It is impossible that a more
" pregnant instance " could be adduced of the eifect of evaporation alone in main-

taining a powerful current, than is afforded by this case of the Karaboghaz.

   That when the basin of the Caspian had been once completely isolated, the level
of its water was rapidly lowered by evaporation, until its area was so far reduced
as to keep down the amount of evaporation to that of the return of fresh water by
rain and rivers, is shown by Von Baer to be an almost inevitable inference from
facts of two independent orders. At the height of from 65 to 80 feet above the
present level, the rocks which formed the original sea-shore of the southern basin

have been furrowed out into tooth-shaped points and needles ; lower down, on the

contraiy, the rocks now laid bare show no trace of the erosive action of the water

so that its level would seem to have sunk too rapidly to allow the waves sufficient
time to attack the clifl-walls effectively. Again, along the shallow border of the

northern basin, the shore for a space of 250 miles is gashed with thousands of
narrow channels, from 12 to 30 miles in length, separated by chains of hUlocks,
which pass inland into the level ground of the steppes. In the neighbom-hood of

the mouths of the Volga, which brings down a greatly increased volume of water

at the time of the melting of the snows, the excess flows into these channels, and

thus tends to keep them open ; so that, when the inundation is over, the sea again
passes up them. Further to the south, on the other hand, the channels, like the

intervening hillocks, are not continuous, but form chains of little lakes separated
by sandy isthmuses. Although these channels run nearly parallel to each other,
yet they have a somewhat fan-like arrangement, their centre of radiation being

the higher part of the isthmus which separates the slope of the Caspian from that

of the N.E. portion of the Black Sea. It is difficult to see how these channels can

have been formed, except by the furrowing of the soft soil during the rapid

sinking of the level of the Caspian water, as happens on the muddy banks of a

reservoir in which the water is being rapidly lowered by the opening of a sluice-

gate.

   Now since, in the area of the Caspian as at present limited, an equilibrium has

been established between the qviantity of water lost by evaporation and that
 returned to it by rain and rivers (for there is no reason to believe that any con-

 tinuous change of level is noio going on), we can arrive at a better idea of what
 the amount of such evaporation really is, from what is needed to make it good,
than we have any other means of forming. The Volga is, next to the Danube, the

 largest European river, and its drainage-area is enormous ; the Ural is a consider-

able river, probably not bringing down much less water than the Don ; whilst the
Kur and the Araxes, which drain a large pai't of Transcaucasia, cannot together be
much inferior to the Dnieper ; and yet the whole mass of water brought down by

these four rivers serves only to keep the present level of the Caspian from being
further lowered by evaporation.

                       By Captain J. E. Davis, E.N., F.E.G.S.

    Captain Davis having briefly described the circumstances that led to the
Government imdertaking to send the ' Challenger ' on a voyage of scientific
discovery round the world, and also the ship herself and her fitting for the
voyage, which, he said, were most perfect in every particular, he proceeded :
The * Challenger ' sailed from Portsmouth on the 21st of December, and on her

passage down Channel and across the Bay of Biscay encountered the weather

usually met with at that season of the year.

The first deep sounding, in 1125 fathoms off, but to the southward of, Cape

Finisterre, was not very successful. The second trial proved more successful, and

some bright-coloured starfishes and other animals were brought to light. Another

attempt at dredging was made in nearly 2000 fathoms, but whether it fouled the

Gibraltar and Lisbon cable or a rock it mattered little, for after trying seven hours

to extricate it, the rope broke and the dredge was lost. The ' Challenger ' reached

Lisbon on the .3rd of January.

On leaving Lisbon the 'Challenger' sounded in the vicinity of two rocks of

870 and 423 fathoms, and obtained 1270 fathoms near them and 1380 fathoms

between them; aud although the presumption is that they do not exist, still,

from what I shall have to remark as I go on, it would be almost presumption

to assert it; and an instance occurred the next day to bear me out in this,

as in dredging off Cape St. Vincent, where the dredge was let down in 525

fathoms, the ship drifted quickly into 900 fathoms, so steep was the incline.

Gibraltar was reached ou the 18th ; and on leaving it a few days after, pi"o-

ceeded in a westerly direction, in order to get on the direct line between Lisbon

and Madeira, as a telegraphic cable was to be laid between the two places. It

"will be observed that much deeper water was obtained ou the way out than at the

exti'emity of the line. In 1(P west longitude 2500 fathoms were obtained, while

60 or 70 miles west of it only 1500, with still shoaler water outside.

The 'Challenger * reached Madeira on the 3rd of February, aud Tenerifie on the 5th.

Leaving Tenerifie for Sombrero Island on the 14th, a course was shaped to the south-

east, aud when 57 miles from the peak, 1890 fathoms were obtained. The weather

being fine, the opportunity was a good one for trjdng Mr. Siemens's ingenious

differential resistance-coil. It was tested in comparison with the Miller thermo-

meter at 100, 200, 500, 700_, 800, and 1000 fathoms respectively ; the difference at
100 fathoms was 2° ininus in the Siemens, which gradually changed to 2^ jjlus at

1000 fathoms. With any motion in the ship the difficult}' in reading off a delicate

galvanometer appears to be an insurmountable objection to this otherwise valuable

instrument, and in the absence of regular thermometers could not be depended on.

The serial observations of the temperature of the ocean at various depths were now

commenced. Captain Davis here described the modus operandi of obtaining these

--observations, and then proceeded as follows : As might be expected in the vicinity

of volcanic islands, there were gi-eat inequalities in the bottom, and 50 miles out-

side, a depth of 1945 fathoms, 1225 were obtained, and near that, to the southward,

2220, showing some steep acclivities and depressions. The bottom specimens

brought up coincided -s^dth the soundings ; from the shallower sounding, stones,

sand, aud shells were obtained ; whilst from the deeper waters, Globif/erma-ooze.

The water deepened to 3150 fathoms at two fifths the distance on the section, and

then shoaled to 1900 at three fifths the distance, deepening again gradually to 3000

fathoms 300 miles from Sombrero, Thus there appears to be two deep' basins or

valleys with a rise between them, and agreeing in contour with a few soimdings

obtained more to the southward. The section from Cape Verdes to Bahia will be

most interesting in connexion with this part of the voyage and the two deeps

ound.

Another point of observation in tliis line of soundings is in the nature of the

bottom. In all the soundings exceeding about 2700 fathoms, the bottom is red

clay, while in the shoaler water of the bank between it is ooze. The ' Challenger

anchored at St. Thomas on the 16th of March and sailed again on the 24th for

Bermuda, first taking some soundings and dredging in the immediate vicinity of

the islands, and then stretching away to the northward towards Bermuda.

   On the 2Gth, when only 80 miles from the land, a sounding was taken of the

--greatest known depth in the world, viz. 3875 fathoms nearly 4h miles. Not ima-

gining that so near the islands so great depth of water could be found, only 3 cwt. of

sinkers were used with  the  hydra machine                                                             two thermometers  and a water-bottle
                                                                                                    ;

were attached to the line : the line was 1'' 12'" running out, the last 100 fathoms

taking 3TM 18^ The small dredge was let down and this extraordinary depth

dredged with 5 miles of rope ; the dredge on coming up brought a small quantity

of mud, but with little sign of animal life. The thermometers were both broken by

the enormous pressure, the pressure at that d»pth being equal to about 704 atmo-

spheres, or 10,600 lbs. to the square ineh. (The thermometers so broken were

exhibited at the Section.)

   From this deep sounding the water shoaled 1000 fathoms at a distance of 110

miles, and then continued without any great alteration until close to Bermuda, at

which place the ' Challenger ' arrived on the 4th of April.
   The several deep soundings taken round Bermuda prove it to be a peak on which

the coral animals have built the islands ; and from the fact of there being con-

siderable magnetic disturbance at difierent stations on the island, it may be inferred

that, unlike the coral formations of the Pacific, there has been no subsidence of the

--mountain. There are two or three other peaks similar to that of Bermuda for

instance, the Sainthill and Milne banks, one with 100 fathoms, the other with

80 fathoms on it.  These are well authenticated soundings and had the peaks
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

been a few fathoms nearer the sm-face, doubtless we should have had two islands

similar to Bermuda.

   The ' Challenger ' left Bermuda on the morning of the 21st April. Proceeding

to the north-west towards New York, the deepest water, 2800 fathoms, was found

about midway between Bermuda and the southern edge of the Gulf-stream. Soon

after noon on the 30th the southern edge was crossed, the temperature of the

surface-water changing suddenly from 65° to 72°.

Great exertions were made to obtain a sounding in the strength of the Gulf-stream,

but the strength of the cun-ent prevented its accomplishment ; but conclusions were
drawn from the observations made, that at this section of the Gulf-stream it is

57 miles wide and 100 fathoms deep, that the rapid part of the current did not

exceed a breadth of 15 miles, and that the rate of the current is 3| to 4 miles an

hour, and that the temperature of this belt of rapid current exceeded by 3° the

other parts of the stream.

   On the return voyage from Halifax to Bermuda Captain Nares sounded close
to the position of the Hope Bank, on which there is said to be 49 fathoms, but

he found no indications of its existence.

   On the voyage across the ocean from Bermuda to the Azores there is not much
to comment on. The water suddenly deepened to 2360 fathoms at a distance of

60 miles from Bermuda ; and the deepest water on the section was 2875 fathoms,

being one third the distance from Bermuda, and then shoaled gradually towards

Fayal.

The 'Challenger' reached Fayal on the 9th of July, and then went to St. Michael's,

from which place she went directly to Cape-Yerde Islands, and arrived at St.

Vincent on tne 27th of July.

        Three Visits to New Guinea. By the Rev. W. Wyatt Gill, B.A.

  My first visit was in October 1872, when I landed on Tauan, a lofty island sepa-
rated from the mainland of New Guinea by a strait 4 miles wide. Near to Tauan,

and formerly considered to be a part of it, is the low, fruitful, unhealthy island of

Saibai, 10 miles in length. The interior of Saibai is a vast morass, with myriads

of snipes, curlews, &c. The inhabitants are a fine Negrillo race, very suspicious of
strangers. On both this and the adjacent island the houses of chiefs and warriors

are ornamented with strings of skulls of New-Guinea Bushmen. In the principal

village of Saibai stands a lofty cocoa-palm, with two branches growing out of the

parent stem at the same point.

  A few days afterwards we steamed on to Katau, a village on the south-western

coast of New Guinea. The coast was covered with stately melancholy mangroves,

very unlike the scrub bearing the same name in Q,ueensland. A conical hiU some

miles inland alone relieved the monotony of the scene. The navigation of this

unsurveyed coast is most critical, owing to the presence of coral-reefs and sunken

rocks. The dwellings composing the village of Katau are but few in number, but

of immense length. They are built on piles, with end verandahs, and thatched

with the leaves of the sago-palm. In one village we entered a dwelling with

sleeping accommodation for upwards of sixty couples ! Tobacco is largely culti-

vated. The pipe was 33 inches in length, consisting of a piece of bamboo with a

movable bowl. The fumes are inhaled. Our interpreters secured a good reception

for us wherever we went.

  A second or eastern mouth of the Katau river was discovered as we pressed on

to the village of Torotoram, which is larger than the village we had left. To get

to it we had to wade more than half a mile over a bank of fine black sand. On

our arrival we found that the entire population had tied into the bush with all
their valuables, excepting four or five men, who stood doubtfully in front of a house

watching the movements of the strangers. As soon, however, as it became evident

to these scouts that no hostility was intended, the whole male population returned.

Not a woman, a child, or a decrepit man was seen during our visit.

  This part of New Guinea, from the western limits of the Katau district to Bris-

towe Island, is called Mauat by the natives and by the Torres-Strait Islanders.

Opposite Bristowe Island is a deep navigable river, half a mile across, supposed to

be a branch of the Fly. The aborigines of this part of New Guinea call their great

island Daudai. Torres-Strait Islanders corrupt this into Daudi. Australia is

known as Great Daudai, New Guinea as Little Daudai. Although upwards of
seven weeks were spent in New Guinea waters, never once did we hear this famous

island called "Papua."

Two small rivers empty themselves into the Straits opposite to two islets not

marked on any chart.

A' second visit was paid to Mauat about a week afterwards. The same feeling

of cordiality prevailed as at the first. One of our party walked into the bush for

two miles amongst luxuriant plantations of bananas and taro. The country was a

dead level, the soil of the richest description. The bread-fruit-tree grows luxu-

riantly. Kangaroos, a peculiar species of hog (<S'«s 2m2ntensis), dingos, opossums,

and cassowaries abound. At first sight we mistook several highly polished leg-

bones of the "Samu" (cassowary), used for hu.sking cocoa-nuts, for human bones.

Some miles to the west of Mauat lies Baigo, or Talbot Island. The inhabitants

of the mainland near Baigo are numerous, but by no means to be trusted.

On the 19th of November, 1872, we started from Mer for the eastern peninsula

Weof New Guinea.        sailed through Flinder's Passage into the open Gulf of

Papua, thus leaving awhile the most extensive coral-reef in the world, inside of

which we had been sailing for two months. Two days afterwards we sighted the

lofty mountain-range which forms the backbone of the peninsula, affording a

Astriking contrast to the low south-western coast.  great number of palms were

seen drifting with the current, the stems and fronds covered with sea-birds. The

appearance of Yule Island was very park-like, clear grassy spots alternating with

picturesque clumps of trees. The island is 4 milss in length, and of considerable

height. Early on the following morning we anchored in Redscar Bay, close to the

islet of Varivara (the Parivara of the charts).

The inhabitants of the little hamlet of Kido were timid, but very pacifically

inclined. On the following day we discovered the river and village of Manumanu.

The village consists of ninety-four houses, with a population of about 1000. The

houses are two-storied, and are all built on high stakes. The women are exqui-
sitely tattooed, but the men not so extensively. The complexion of these people is

nearly the same as that of the Samoans and Rarotongans, but in stature and

physical strength they are much inferior. Many words are identical in all three
dialects, proving them to be essentially one. It is impossible for any one who has
seen these pleasant, gentle, light-skinned natives of Manumanu to doubt that they

are of Malay origin.

Manumanu river (erroneously called the "Towtou" in the charts) is over a

Wemile across at its mouth in the driest month of the year.  ascended the river

to a distance of 7 miles, but found the country everywhere to be an immense

swamp. Just beyond is the first interior native village, named Koitapii.

  A most interesting fact is now for the first time ascertained, viz. that Mantcmanu

Notes of recent Travel in Persia. By Colonel Sir Fkedeeic Goldsmid, K.S.I.

The paper comrnenced with a review of Persia at the present day, according to

geographical limits, as compared with Persia of the past, arguing that it may he

said to comprise now quite as much settled aud consolidated territory as at any
period of its political existence of which we can speak with the authority of

intimate acquaintance. If she has less extent of land than before her latest disas-

trous war with Russia, there is, at least within her recognized limits, less rebellion

and more allegiance. Allusion was made to the various works of reference on the

country, from those of Tavernier and Chardin up to the existing time ; and it was
asserted that to the nineteenth century we were indebted for the most important

additions to our knowledge of the geography and people of this part of Central

Asia. As regiirds the diplomatic relations between Persia and the European states,

Wethere was practically none of these had more to do with her than England.

no longer sent our commissioned officers to teach her the art of war, but we had

for nearly ten years supplied her with commissioned and non-commissioned officers

of engineers to direct and maintain her lines of telegraph. By Convention of No-

vember 1865, this number was raised to fifty. Since that period the number was

increased. In the very recent Convention no specification of numbers of emi>loyes

is made at all; and a plain straightforward agreement for maintaining and working

the line has been accepted on both sides for a further term exceeding twenty years.

The routes more particularly described were those traversed by the writer from

Resht to Tehran, from Bushahr to Tehran, and from Mash-had to Tehran. The

first might be stated generally as one fourth low forest, one fourth mountainous,

and one half a tolerably level plain. To Kazvin the scenery is very varied but
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

the latter town, although it has a telegTaph-office and post-house, and is interesting

in its history and remains, as an abode of civilized life is orderless and methodless.

From Bushahr to Tehran, the first section of the road, or 170 miles, conimences

with a low marshy coast, and rises to a height above 7000 feet among noble

mountains, ending at a lower but still respectable elevation at Shiraz. The second

section is of 265 miles, to Ispahan, and is interesting from the ruius of Persepolis

and other monuments of antiquity, as well as mountain scenery and the presence of
" Iliats " or wandering tribes. The third and last section of 250 miles, to Tehran,

has for its attractions the charming mountain-station of Kohrud and the cities of

Kashan  and  Kum                              but  between  Kum  and  Tehran  is a desert not inaptly termed
                                           ;

that of " the Angel of Death," so utterly blank and desolate does it appear. From

Mashhad to Tehran there are here and there pleasant or interesting halts ; but the

gi-eater part of the 540 miles is monotonous, and some 60 to 100 miles are infested

by the Turkman hordes.

Some account was also given of the cities of Tehran, Ispahan, Mashhad, and

Kazvin, and the following extracts may have interest as conveying recent and

original impressions :

" 1 should not say that life in Persia was generally suited to Europeans ; but it

promises, at least, to be more so as intercourse progresses, for the drawbacks are

rather social than physical or external. In the north, except for two or three

summer months, the climate is agreeable enough, aud even at tlie hottest time it is
seldom that the nights are oppressive. To those who come from India direct, or

to whom Indian heat is habitual, the change is most delightful. There are days in

autumn, winter, and spring which leave the impression of unequalled temperatm-e
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and the blue sky, with its tempering haze, as it were a veil of reflected snow

gathered from the higher peaks or ridges of continuous mountain-chains, is too

exquisite a picture to be readily forgotten. In the late spring Fashion moves out a

few miles from Tehran to the cooler residences near the mountains, returning in

the late autumn to the precincts of the capital. These, it may be noted, have been

considerably extended of late years, and are designed for yet further extension. . . .

    " Persian houses are not comfortable, in the English sense. Although the cha-
racter of native Persian domestic relations involves separate suites of rooms, there

is no privacy in any department ; for the women's part is as much frequented by
women and children as the men's by the ruder sex of all ages and classes. Servants,
unless kept away by order (a dangerous process with the idler ones), are apt to be

ubiquitous, and turn up at all hours of the day about the house, noisily bickering,
listlessly squatting, or moving with silent solemnity. Visitors used to give notice
of coming, but are gradually and tacitly abrogating the practice ; and natives and
Europeans will soon, it is presumed, call upon each other in Persia with as liUle
ceremony as elsewhere. Nor is it unlikely that the habit of bringing tea, coll'ee,
and pipes to every visitor will also faU into disuse. The old orthodox custom of a
threefold supply is, to say the least, inconvenient ; for strict fidfilment of a dozen

visits would necessitate the absoi-ption of thirty-six cups of wami liquid and thirty-

six * sets ' of tobacco inhalations."

disastrous famine, gathered during the last two of the three journeys above

mentioned.

             On Assam, and an Overland Communication tvith China*.
                   By J. M'CosH, M.D., late H.M. Bengal Army.

   The subject of this paper is an overland communication between India and
China, between Assam and Yunan, between a navigable branch of the Brahma-
pootra and the Yang-tsi-kiang, between the two most populous empires in the
world--the one numbering 200,000,000 inhabitants, the other 300,000,000. The
author spent the earl}' part of his service in India, in Assam ; and wrote its topo-
graphy, a book published by order of Government. After giving a bird's-ej-e
view of Assam and its suiTOundings, its people and climate, of the discoveiy of tea
in the province, and the rise and fall of its tea-plantations from want of labourers,
he proposes a route direct across from the Brahmapootra through Munnipoor aud
Upper Burmah to Bliamo, aud thence on through Momien and Talifoo to the
Yang-tsi-kiaug. Such a road, even a footpath, if protected by the Chinese, the
Burmese, and the Indian Governments, would afford a ready outlet to the surplus
population of China, and be the means of restoring prosperity to the bankrupt tea-
plantations. Moreover, he expresses a hope that at no distant day the North-
eastern Railwaj' of Bengal shall be extended across from the Brahmapootra to the
Yang-tsi-kiang in the same direction, when the immense trade of the Indus, the
Ganges, and the Brahmapootra, the Ningtee, the In-awaddy, and the Yang-tsi-
kiang, shaU be hoisted on trucks, and rolled from East to West and from West to
East in one gi-and tide, and that the British mercliants shall fill their pitchers from
the stream, and deal out its bounty to the people of the land.

                                By J. TnoMsow, F.B.G.S.

   Mr. Thomson ascended the Yangtsze in the beginning of 1872, having for his
companions two gentlemen, Captains of steamers in the China trade. The party

left I-Chang (a city on the left bank of the river, about 1100 English miles above
Shanghai) on the 7th of February. They engaged a native boat with a crew of

twenty-four men, and proceeded to ascend through the gorges of the Upper
Yangtsze. The river was at its lowest, and in the I-Chang gorge (which is entered
foui'teeu miles above the city) the great river was left, in many places, with a
waterway of only 100 yards wide between gigantic walls of rock. Mr. Thomson

next pi'oceeded to describe the appearance of the I-Chang, Lupan, Mitan, and

Wushan gorges, and the difficulties and dangers to be encountered in the future
steam-navigation of this section of the Upper Yangtsze, where there are many
rapids interspersed with jagged rocks, on which the native trading-boats are
frequently worked. The most formidable rapid was below the village of Isingtan,
at the mouth of the Mitan gorge, where it was customary with the Chinese traders,
before making the ascent, to unload their boats and have the cargo carried overland
to the top of the rapid. The grandeur of the mountain- and river-scenery at this

part of the journey was minutely described, as well as the appearance presented by
the rapid. The author was here aided by the valuable accessoiy of a large photo-
graph, which he had taken on the spot. This and other pictures were obtained at
some personal risk, as Mr. Thomson was stoned and otherwise treated as a veiy
rare and dangerous tj'pe of " Yang-quitsz " (foreign devil), who had come among
them with his picture-taking instrument to extract the secrets out of heaven and
earth. Fond mothers seized their children and carried them awav, as it was popu-
larly believed that the solutions used in taking the pliotographs were made out of
the tender eyes of Chinese childi-en. In the open spaces between the gorges the
temperature was found to be several degrees lower than in the mountain-clefts
which form the gorges. The rapid of Isingtan was running about nine knots, "and
yet the Chinese traders iiud no obstacle in this, or indeed in any of the other
rapids of the Yangtsze, to the carrying on of a lucrative trade with large-sized
cargo-boats." These boats, and their appliances for warding oft" danger, were badly
constructed. Mr. Thomson argues that if the Chinese can do all this, we, with
science, suitable steamers, and pluck, can do more. . " Let the river be opened, and

its successful steam-navigation will follow."

   Some interesting details were furnished regarding the working of coal-mines in
the province of Hupeh. Several mines were visited ; and Mr. Thomson succeeded
in taking a series of photographs of Chinese coal-mining The paper concluded
with au account of the ascent of the Wushan gorge.

ECONOMIC SCIENCE AND STATISTICS.

Address by the Right Hon. W. E. Forstek, M.F., President of the Section.

[Spoken on Monday, September 22nd.]

Your Council have asked me to take the responsible and honourable position of

being the President of one of your Sections. I am quite sure that that honour
cannot have been conferred upon me owing to any special fitness on my part, but

--rather from two facts the one that I do happen to have taken an interest in the

questions that have come before this Section for many years, and the other that 1

am a Bradford townsman and a Bradford Member. As a Bradford man I was so

glad to do what I could to welcome the Association, that I felt I could not refuse

ot try to perform any duty that wns imposed upon me ; but I must acknowledge
that in attempting to do so I have found special grounds of unfitness. The fact is

that my time and thoughts are so occupied with other pressing matters that I

really have not been able to prepare this address with that care and thought, or to

bestow that pains in expressing what I have to say, that I know is due to so

distinguished an audience. I merely make this remark (for I do not want to take

up your time by apologies) to explain why I have not followed the usual course

and brought forward a prepared written address, and why I have thus been obliged

to ask you to let me make a speech instead of reading a paper. I do not deny that
the accident of my being connected with the Government does not specially tit me

for this duty. In this Section we deal, and we must deal, with politics. Under

our title, that of Economic Science and Statistics, there is hardly any question of

political discussion, hardly any immediate question of pressing legislation, which

may not be brought within its deliberations.  iVnd that has been proved by you
                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

for if you look at your own ' .Jom-nal ' you will see that such political questions

(pressing questions, and I may say burning questions) have been successively

brought before you, as the question of the income tax, the amalgamation of rail-

ways, education (of which last I am not unconscious of the difllcidties), and many
other matters that excite great interest and might be made use of, but I am quite

sure they wiU not at this Association be made use of, for party purposes. But it

certainly, as a general rule, does not become any man who happens to have the

honour of being a member of the Ministry to make suggestions with regard to

political measures, unless he is prepared to bring them forward, and press them

upon the responsibility of Government. It rather becomes such members of the

AMinistry to hear suggestions, to listen to them, and carefully consider them.

man who is a member of the Cabinet must also recollect that he must consider his

colleagues, and must be very careful to say nothing that will commit them.

However, care in these matters may be pushed too far ; and as I am here now all I
can do is to ask you to forget, as I have tried to do, that I am connected with the

Government, and to remember that in what I now say I commit no one but myself.

--I think this question will occur to many of you, as it did to me Why, in this

Association, do we deal with politics ? What business have we to have such a

Section as this ? why should we discuss political matters ? what has the discussion

of politics to do with the meetings of a scientific congress ? There is an immediate

answer to this question ; and that is, that after all there is a science in politics. If

-- --the political theorist and I do not use the word as a word of reproach but if the

political thinker misconceives or misstates or mistakes his facts or his statistics, he

as surely fails in evolving any thought of value as does the student of physical

science who generalizes from a partial or imperfect series of experiments. In like

manner, if the practical politician, in attempting to apply the principles of economic

science, breaks the laws of that science (for instance, the laws of political economy),

the result will be that he will pay the penalty in the failm-e of his political

measures, as certainly as does the practical mechanic or chemist who ignores the

laws of chemistiy or those regulating the application of mechanical forces. But it

may be said that although this is true, such is the immense range which our Section
would extend over, that there would be a danger in its taking up too much of our

attention, and that these subjects had better be loft to the kindred Association
            TKANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                       175

--which was started as the great development of our Section the Social Science

Association, of which my noble friend Lord Houghton will be chairman on an

early day. But I do not think there is any dan<j:er of our monopolizing too much

attention. After all, a very large number of members of our Association are those

who act with great knowledge and interest in phj'sical science, and who with great

power give information and show anxiety to hear what their fellow members have

to tell them. But L should be sorry to see this Section omitted from our pro-

gi-amme. I think there is great advantage in bringing together men of science and

politicians. Perhaps one result of this may be that we shall obtain higher scientific

culture. I wish that this may be the case. Over and over again in the work I

my myhaAe felt it                                                                                                                                                                                           own scientific ignorance. 1
            dutj- to try to do, I have lamented

have felt, and I have no doubt others who have attempted it have also felt, that we

could act more successfully if we knew more of the laws of nature. There is hardly

any fact in human intercourse, hardly any influence which a man can bring to bear

--on his fellow men that might not be explained, illustrated, and enforced by some

analogy of outward nature that has not, as it were, its counterpart in the workings

of nature, in the eyes of the man who is fortunate enough to have some real know-

ledge of both men and things. Again, there is undoubtedly an advantage in sub-

jecting political questions to the conditions of scientific debate. It is well that they

shoidd sometimes be treated and debated in that temper and with that simple desire

for the discovery of truth which ought to characterize all scientific discussion.

Then, again, as regards this special Section there is an advantage in the political

theorists or thinkers beiug brought into contact with the practical politicians ; for

when they come together I think the theorist would perhaps learn to appreciate

and estimate more fairly than he sometimes does the immense friction, if I may use

the term, with which the practical politician has to deal, and which he finds to

clog and interfere with his efibrts. It is not sufficient to enounce and explain the

laws of economic science. In outward nature you have to deal with dead facts.

In economic science, affecting the political and social condition of men, you have

to deal with persons who have free will and the power of exercising it and of

refusing to obey the laws which you explain ; and we none of us can forget that we

have to contend with and to take account of the likes and dislikes of men, and the

passions and even the prejudices of men, and that it is not enough for a State to

-- Wedeclare the laws of economic science of political economy, for example.

must not forget that many men will not obey these laws, however clearly we may

explain them and point out the penalty of their transgression. Sometimes they

disbelieve in the penalty ; often they ignore it ; and not seldom, knowing its exis-

Wetence, they prefer to incur it.  must take into account the existence of this
--friction, and we must be prepared for this result a very disappointing result, and

a result of which I am sure experimental philosophers would greatly complain if

they were beset with it in physical science                                                                                                                                                                 and that is, that though  just  in  pro-
                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

portion as in any political measure the laws of economic science are broken, there

wiU be weakness, and probably failure in that political measure, it by no means

follows that just in proportion as the law is kept and adhered to there will he

success. It is not seldom the case that by its very truthfulness a measure excites

so mucli opposition that it ensures its own defeat. Well, that is a reason, which

thinkers ought to bear in mind when they sometimes accuse political men of

delaying to bring forward measures of which they are convinced. It is a ground,

and a reasonable and proper ground, very often for the postponement of a political

measure based upon true principles. Those who are most in favour of such a

measure and most advocate it, feel that they are doing it harm by prematurely

bringing it forward ; but some persons push that doctrine too far, and say that it is

a reason and an excuse why a measure should be brought forward upon false prin-

Nowciples.  that I do not admit. I believe that nothing really is gained, though

something may sometimes seem to be gained, by any man bringing forward a
political measure upon principles in which he himself disbelieves. He may bo

quite sure that in the diflerent opinions of men, if it be at all desirable that such a

measure should become law, there are plenty of people (if he wiU simply drop
behind and not do that of which he disapproves) who will come for\vard and
advocate it who do really approve of it.

But I must now, after these prefatory remarks, go to the special work of tliis

Section. I believe it is usual for the President to refer in his address to the pro-

gress of Economic Science for the past year. Well, I think you will hardly expect

me to do that. If I were to refer to the progress of Economic Science, I should

have to show to what extent, amongst other ways, it has been put forward or not

in legislation ; I should have to defend the Government against charges that might

perhaps be made of its not having been put forward. Well, I believe Ihat you will

feel that I should be taking a very unfair advantage of the post I occupy, and of

the duty you have kindly imposed upon me, if 1 were to make this an opportunity

of defending the Government. And, in fact, I cannot forget that one very impor-

tant branch of Economic Science would be considered to be that witli which I am

--myself connected that of education ; and if I were to attempt such a review it

would necessarily partake of a much more personal character than I should desire.

I therefore resist the temptation, although I do not deny that it is a temptation

when I have before me such an audience as this, to vindicate the principles upon

--which, on behalf of the Government, I have acted or, at any rate, to explain (and

I think I should be able to explain with success) the fact that we have acted upon

principles, and not upon motives of expediency. But, talking of a review of pro-

gress, I should be exceedingly glad if I were able to make any full statement of the

progi-ess which has been made in the economic condition of the English people

not for the last year only, for we cannot judge by such a short period, but for a

longer time, say from the time when this Section was first formed, which I believe

Nowto be about forty years.  what, after all, is the gi-eat object of our delibera-

Whytions in this Section ?  do we collect and test and analyze statistics ? and why

do we study the principles of economic science, and the mode in which those prin-

ciples are and ought to be applied ? Many would reply mainly in order to promote

the economic well-being of the great mass of the community. Well, I should be

exceedingly glad if some member of your Association, well qualified to do so, would

consider whether, at some forthcoming opportunity, a careful comparison could not

be made as to the economic condition of the great mass of the English people at

this time as compared with what it was forty years ago. I have not made that

comparison, I have not had time to collect the necessary statistics ; but I think this

statement will hardly be challenged, that (take for example the condition of the

manual labom-ers of the country, which is after all the largest class of the com-

munity, and must continue to be so) there has been progress the most hopeful for

the future, and the most remarkable as compared with like periods in the past. 1

do not think it will be denied that the great body of manual labourers throughout

the country have a greater share of the comforts and enjoyments of life than they

had forty years ago ; that they are able to obtain more of the necessaries and com-

forts and even of some of the luxuries of life : that their wages are higher (on

--which point I would refer you to the paper read j'esterday by Professor Leone

Levi, bearing in some measure on this matter) not only higher in themselves, but

also as compared with the cost of living. There was great reason that they should

be higher. The higher rate, too, is earned with shorter hours, and by labour, gene-

-- --rally speaking 1 won't now speak of everj' trade, but generally speaking under

improved conditions from those which existed at the former period.

Passing from these purely material conditions, much as there is yet to do in

education, no one will deny that there has been progress in education. No one, I

think, will deny that there has been progTess in general culture ; and, speaking

generally, I believe there has been great progress in better and more kindly rela-

tions between this large and important class and other classes of the community.

Well, now, I should be very sorry if these remarks were misapprehended. Do not
suppose me to think that in stating my belief that there has been progress that we

have got to that point at which we can rest and be thankful. I should be very

sorry to be supposed for a moment to be suggesting apathy to ourselves in our

endeavours to improve the condition of the manual labourer, or suggesting or

--advising content to him if by content be meant a cessation of efibrts for his own

improvement. I believe there is much in the conditions of labour and the state of

manual labourers throughout the coimtry to which the word content would be by-

no means applicable. There is much for others to do for them, and still more for

them to do for themselves. I merely mention this progress as a stimulus for the

future, not as any ground for rest. This is not the place or the time to dilate upon

what labourers can do for themselves                                                                                                                                               and  all  I  would say on that  matter is that
                                                                                                                                                                                ;

when any of us are advised or speak against what we may think to be the besetting

sins of the labouring class, we ought never to forget what are the besetting sins of
Weour own class.
                                       must also recollect that in the present state of civilization we
--must make a great distinction between crime and vice remembering that crime
Weand vice cannot be attacked in like manner.
                                                                                                                                                                                                must continue to punish crime,

to bring force to bear upon it ; but as regards vice (and I include in it that gi-eat

and terrible vice of di'imkenness) I believe we shall be obliged to admit that

the time has long passed (indeed I doubt when it ever existed) in which we can

attack vice with success by force, or by any means but persuasion. As regards,

however, what can be done by others, by such a Section as this, by the Legislature,

for the condition of the manual labourers, I believe that, notwithstanding what has
been done, very much more may be done.

 --I alluded to what appears to be, speaking generally, the improved condition of

the labourer that is to say, by the help of scientific discoveries man fights nature

with less suffering to himself There are many of us who can detail the beneficent

results of scientific discovery in one case after another. All I will say is that I

belie\ e these conquests over nature are but the prelude to futm-e triumphs, and that

I look forward to these great and beneficent results being still more apparent in the

--futiu-e than thej' have been in the past, from the thought and experiments of scientific

men that they will enable the products of natm-e to be realized for the good of
men with less sutieriug to the individual worker. Take, again, the advantages of

free  trade                            and what,  after  all,  is  free  trade but                                                                                                           the  simple  carrying out  of scientific
                                    ;

laws? It means nothing else. There was a dispute in old time as to whether the

manual labourer would gain by free trade. No one would now raise that dispute

for a moment. Not only English labourers have gained, but, from our having learnt

the lesson and having adopted the principles of free trade, even the labourers of

other countries where they have not learnt these principles have shared in the

advantages of free trade, which we in these great centres of commerce have made

our own. I do trust we may now see grounds for supposing that other nations are

learning from om- example ; and as their working men have gained by what we have
done, so our working men may gain by what they will do. I can hardly avoid

--making one allusion to an event of the past year ^to the very encouraging support
of free trade shown by the action of the French Government. To the Emperor
Napoleon we have all been grateful for using his power for the encouragement of
free trade, and we have to acknowledge his patriotism and his fidelity to knowledge,

and to truthful political philosophy, in establishing some encouraging principles of

free trade in France ; but we know that they were forced upon the French people, and
we did not know what they might do when they had freedom. But in that matter

they have had freedom to do as they thought best, but in conditions of disadvantage

to free trade. The Government (though they had a great statesman who was not
himself convinced upon the matter, and who "had great infiuence) in the past year

declared themselves decidedly in favour of free trade. I cannot doubt that that

fact will have taken hold upon men both in the United States and elsewhere.

But economic science does not apply merely to the interchange of commodities

between nations, but to the interchange of all matters of value. I think we feel

that its principles must be enforced and cai-ried out both with regard to land and

to labour. There should be nothing in law whatever which should prevent the

most entire freedom in selling and bu}dng land ; this principle can hardly be dis-

puted, and its mere statement is almost sufficient to encourage us in the reforms that

will be necessary to carry it out. The same principle applies to labom- ; there must

be freedom to sell it and freedom to buy it. Then, again, I suppose sanitary im-

provements must be considered to come within the range of our Section. Well,

there is much, very much, to do in that matter. I think our aims in this direction

Weare higher (and I take comfort from the fact) than they used to be.                                                                                                                                                   are

aiming not only at preventing death, but at making life better worth living, by
making it more healthy ; and we no longer forget that in fighting our battle against

disease it is not those only who are killed that are to De considered, but also

the wounded. In the terrible inflictions of preventible disease throughout the
178 REPORT-- 1873.

coimtry tLe loss of life is very sad ; but even more sorrowful, to iny miud, are the

numbers of our fellow creatures (fellow countrj'men and women) who are doomed

to struggle and fight the battle of life under the most severe conditions because of

the wounds they have received from preveutible diseases. And on a matter like

this you will at once see the advantages of this Section. It is most desirable that

all those projects for sanitary improvement which are proposed by political thinkers

or by practical politicians should be at once tested by scientific laws, and by men
who are accustomed to make these laws their special subject. I will not say any

thing more about my own particular Section ; I would merely refer to what I

ventured to say after the able address of your President on Wednesday evening.

I would, however, refer to the discussion yesterday on the papers read by my

friends Mr. Morris and Professor Leone Levi with reference to our expecting in the

increased well-being of the community a greater diminution in the pauperism of

the coimtry than we yet see. I believe there is a diminution, and I am hopeful

that it will be shown to a greater extent in a short period. But I am rather

anxious (I may be thought bj' some rather heretical in what I am going to say)

that in our objection to the evils that accompany a poor law we should not carry

that objection to the extent of imagining that we could do without any poor law.

The objections to the poor law lie upon the surface. I fear it is true that it does

encourage a want of thrift, and to some extent does deaden or weaken and make

less likely the performance of domestic duties. And there ought to be very great

reason for the poor law if it be possible to make this charge. I think there is great

reason. I do not believe that in the present state of civilization it is safe or right

--not to acknowledge the principle of the poor law namely, that a man shall have a

right to live, and that absolute destitution shall be prevented. Very few of us are

aware of the advantage that the acknowledgment of this principle lias been to us.

In comparing our social struggles (our political convulsions) in England with those

of the Continent, I believe that the one great reason why we have got through

them with comparative safety, and have had reform instead of revolution, has been

that the large Dody of our people have known that this right is acknowledged

the right to live.

Going back to the progress to which I have referred, we must bear in mind two

facts. Those of you who have studied political economy and are familiar with the

writers on that subject of twenty, thirty, and forty years ago, will remember that

they almost all supposed that there would be no great improvement without an

increase in the population, or at any rate without a great decrease in its in-

crease, if I may so put it. ]\Ir. Malthus, Mr. Mill, and many other most able and

excellent political economists, advocated very strongly what they called a pru-

dential check on population as the only means, or the most probable means, of

making progress in prosperity. Well, but our progress has been made without this

check and in spite of the great increase in population. I am a bad statistician, but

I believe the increase during the last forty years has been greater than in almost

any other previous term of forty years. The increase in the population of England

and Wales, in round numbers, has been from sixteen and a half millions in 1831 to

twenty-one and a half millions in 1871, and yet the population is more prosperous.

Again, if there has been great progress on the whole in the well-being of the

labourer, there has also been progress in the well-being of the capitalist. I am not

going to speak of the special profits of special trades, but I believe it would be easy

to prove that the increase of capital in this country has been much more than has

kept pace with the increase of population. Well, if both classes, capitalists and

labourers, have on the whole bettered their condition, I am not at all surprised to

myfind that there is, as I believe, a better feeling between the two. I hope                                                    friend

Mr. Morris, if he is here, will let me make some allusion to his able paper of yester-

day.  I do not agree with  all  his views                                                but  I wish  to  treat  them  in  the  same
                                                                                      ;
--spirit with which he treated the views of others a spirit of fairness and wilHng-

ness to appreciate what could he said on the other side. I am aware it is by no

means a rare feeling, but a very common feeling at this time, that the disputes

between labour and capital are more dangerous and more fierce than they were at

former periods. I must demur to this statement. I think it may be true that

these disputes are sometimes carried on upon a larger scale than formerly, because
        TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                               179

the number of labourers is greater now, aud the power of communication is much

easier ; but what I venture to say is this, that these disputes are conducted with
much less herceness and acrimony than in former times. I also believe that

they, generally speaking, do not last so long. For instance, there are some

Bradford men, I suppose, who can remember the fierce struggle there was against

--the introduction of machinery into Bradford the violent fights that there were at

that time, though it would be almost impossible to have any thing of that kind in

Bradford now. Again, I can recollect almost as a boy I was learning a manufac-

turing business at Norwich, and there was a dispute, and the masters had to walk

through the town looking with suspicion at almost everybodj' that was coming

near them for fear of having vitriol thrown into their eyes. That, again, is a state

of things that has long passed away. Again, take the Preston strike of twenty

years ago, which I studied somewhat keenly. That was a struggle that lasted longer

than almost any dispute of modern times ; and I must add my conviction that there
is not now that foolish struggle against the laws of science that there was in former

times.

Well, then, as I demur to my friend Mr. Morris's statement, he will not be sur-

frised if I say that I demur to the remedy he proposed at the close of his paper,

think he oven-ates the evil ; but whether he does so or not, his remedy (a league

of capitalists and capital throughout the country) is one which I should be most

grieved to see any attempt to apply. Whatever individual labourers may advise

their fellows, I believe that in this country, where the interests of the labouring

men are so varied, however it maybe advised, a league of labour against capital is
impossible. There may be talk about it at meeting.s, and there may be talk about

it in the newspapers, but I do not believe in its possibility, though, if any thing
could make it possible, it would be a league of capitalists against labourers. I

think we shall agree that two such opposing leagues would be one of the gi-eatest

calamities from which the coimtry could suffer. I should tremble at the thought

of om- industry being divided into hostile forces, and all the industrial workers of
England being distributed into opposing camps. Some persons woidd say it is

--impossible, because the capitalists aud labourers would be so unequally matched in

power that now you have given votes to the labourers, their numbers and the
Sower of their votes would make them so much stronger than the capitalists,

  'ow, I cannot take that ground myself I think if the two parties were unwise
enough to band themselves in opposition (a thing which I believe they never will
do) they woidd not be so unequally matched. I believe that money will always
buy men, and capital always find support amongst labourers. I beUeve they would

not be unmatched in power; and although I know very well that my friend and

others only mention such a remedy for extreme occasions, and would advocate it

on the fairest principles, I believe that if the contest once took place it would be
conducted with equal recklessness on both sides. Under these circumstances I
take some additional comfort from one political measiu-e with which I ha-\-e had
something to do. If there was any thing like such a struggle between classes

throughout the coimtry, there would be such a disposition on the side of each

party to clutch the power of the law, and to aim at legislative measures as

cannot but make me feel glad that the Government of which I am a member

have done somethiug towards bridling the power of the leaders on each side by

giving to the voters the protection of the ballot. And this brings me to one re-
mark which perhaps you will allow me to make, aud it is this : that, putting aside
the nossibility of these opposing leagues (and I dismiss them from my mind), I
think that on both sides (those who advocate the rights of labom- and those who

advocate the protection of the rights of capital) there is a little too much anxiety

to make use of the law. No doubt there should be perfect freedom in selling

labour, and that implies that there should be perfect freedom in combination.

I believe there was no greater mistake than the attempt to prevent a man from

agreeing with his fellow workmen as to the conditions upon which he should

like to sell his labour. But, of course, we should also say that there should be

perfect freedom to refuse to combine, and that such right should be respected and

f)rotected. But in our effort to secure that freedom we must not try to get the
Weaw to do that which it cannot rightly or in fact effectually do.
                                                                    can make use

of the law to protect the Queen's subjects against bodily harm and physical

violence, but it is no use attempting to protect men against persuasion or even

against moral iutimidation. They can only protect themselves. And if the law-

attempts or strives to do that it will surely faU, and probably lead those against

whom the attempts are exercised to think that there is a desire to interfere by

recom-se to the law with their reasonable freedom. And I think, in dealing with

this^ question of the law, we should not have recourse to exceptional legislation.
To illustrate that I may say that very few things have been done by the House of
Commons that I so much regi-et as the way in which we dealt with trades unions

at Sheffield. I think the law we passed (in order to get at iufonnatiou with re-

gard to trades imions at Sheffield) to obtain an available blue book as to what had

Webeen done at Sheffield was one much to be regretted.                                     issued a Commission,

and we .stated that eveiy man, whatever he had done, might come before that

Commission and give evidence perfectly fi-ee from any of the consequences of the

crime he had committed. What was the result ? That we had men who had

been engaged in the plotting and planning of deliberate murder, who came forward

and stated what they had been guilty of, and then there was the declaration of the

law which saved them from the consequences of their crime. That did not apply

merely to the case of King's evidence, where the least guilty would be saved, and

the more guilty punished ; but it was a paltering with the law, applying as it did to
all who were giiilty, aflbrdiug as it did protection to the murderer, and that in

order that we might acquire information on which to found exceptional legislation.

Such a step will, I hope, never be repeated. Our real hope in this matter must be
that which has caused wliat I conceive to be the progress that has been made,

--namely, the effect of public opinion and education the slow result of the pro-

clamation of truth as to the relations of labour and capital. By these means alone
we can hope to solve the difficulties which exist ; and I cannot but think that such a

Section aa this wUl be a most useful aid in this important work. I may be told that

this hope is rash when we see the extraordinary ideas which are propagated in Con-

gresses, and reported day by day in the newspapers. Well, I have read with great
interest what lias been said in Geneva at both these Congresses, and I have observed

this encouraging fact, that hardly any Englishmen have taken part in them and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

that, when they did, it was on the side oif good sense, and to denounce wild and

impracticable ideas. But this is not the first time that we have had these notions

declared before us.

  My noble friend Lord Houghton and myself, in 1848, were in Paris, where we

amused and interested ourselves by trying to learn what we could of French notions

at that time about the relations of society, especially of labour and capital ; and I am
sure the ideas which we now think strange were then stated with even more ex-

travagance, and I think with much more agreement among the general public than

at this moment. The Commune of Paris may be quoted ; but I do not think it is

a fair illustration. The Commune had its sad crimes ; of that I fear there can be no

doubt                               but  these  crimes  and  its very existence were  not  so  much  the eff'ect  of
                                 ;

French notions with regard to Communism. They were rather a reaction against

the central and severe despotism which had prevailed in France, destroying, as it

were, all local powers and trving to crush out local life. I believe that a vastly

larger number of working men are admitting now what we consider to be the

Wefundamental facts of political economy than was formerly the case.                                 find they

will now generally acknowledge that there are after all only three ways by which

--labour can be better remunerated. The first is by the increase of capital of the

wages fund. The second is by the diminution of labourers, either by emigration

or by a diminution of population, and that not simply by the diminution of labourers

in a special trade : that is a mistake which they still sometimes fall into ; it may

--appear to relieve a trade for a time, but it only does so by drivins- more labourers

into some other trade making that trade unremunerative or less remunerative

to the labourer, and thus bringing him back to the trade which is more so. The

only way in which they can hope for a remedy under the second head is by a

diminution of labourers generally. The third way in which the conditions of

labour may be improved is that by which the labourer may himself become a

capitalist. Our recent progress has been made almost entirely in consequence of
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                        181

--the action of the first principle I have named, viz. by the effective industry of

the country the capitalist and labourer working successfully together, and thereby

making an immense increase in the capital and in the labour fund : but I think
that all attempts to better the conditions of labour in the third way (that of the

labourer becoming capitalist) are most interesting, most hopeful ; and it seems to

be a special business of such a Section as this to watch the attempts to carry out

these experiments, and to tind out year by year how far they have been successful.

With regard to cooperation, just let me make one remark. There are two kinds

of cooperation, and if we attempt to consider it scientifically we must not mix them

up together. There is that fomi of cooperation in which the capitalist or em-

--ployer pays the labourer not altogether in wages, but by giving him a share of

the profits. I was very hopeful that by such means the relations in question might

be made better ; and I am still hopeful, but perhaps not quite so much so as I was,
because I see clearly two accompaniments of this. One is that we cannot, and

must not, expect tlie labourer to take both sides of the bargain. We_ must not
expect him to suffer loss, for sometimes there is loss. He cannot, if he is working

from week to week, unless he has himself become a capitalist by saying, do with-

out his daily and weekly wages. Therefore we have to pay him his share of the
profits while we cannot make him responsible for a share of any loss. He cannot,

then, be said to be a sharer in the profit and loss ; he is only a sharer in the profit.

Then, again, I think if this were generally done we should find that it would be
merely a mode of payment, though perhaps a more satisfactory mode ; but we might

again have disputes as to the slmre of the profits he ought to have. This does not

prevent us from watching these experiments with great care and anxiety, and with

--great hope. Then tliere is the other mode of cooperation, which may be called co-

operation proper that is to say, the cooperation in which labour is counted as

capital, and the labourer becomes a shareholder, and, putting in some little savings

also, is an actual sharer in the enterprise. Allusion has been made in our discus-

Wesions to the growth of this kind of cooperation in this district.  know it verj'

Wewell in Bradford, and especially in the neighbouring towns.    have seen, for

instance, the enormous and most satisfactory success of the Rochdale Cooperative

Store. It is more difficult to apply this principle to production ; but I am most

anxious to see the experiments in that direction scientifically observed. I am

told, though I do not know whether the statement is altogether borne out, that

cooperative mills have been tried, and, to a great extent, have succeeded in Lan-

cashire, and that cooperative mills, where established, passed the commercial

crisis with great stability. Experiments of this kind are most interesting, and I

can only say that I welcome them with great hopefulness. As an emploj^er of

labour (for I cannot forget that I am still an employer) I think there is great

advantage in working men thus employing themselves and finding out the position

of the capitalists, and also discovering that there is not always a profit, but some-

times a loss, and that we must not, when we look to men who have made large

fortunes, altogether forget that fortunes have been lost. Again, though I cannot

aspire to be a statesman, yet as a politician and as a member of the Government

of the countr}', 1 hail the success of these experiments still more hopefully. It

is said that one of the great causes of stability in America, and even in France,

notwithstanding its many convulsions, is the large number of peasant proprietors

and I think we should have some share of the same kind of stability in this country

by having a large number of working men with their own stake in the country and

their own interest in its prosperous government. One or two facts have come out

even in our discussion which have shown pretty clearly that it is not at all fair,

nor true, to suppose that the wages of the working man are in all cases, or I may
Ksay even generally, so lavishly spent as some persons suppose.
                                                                 we could only

get a really dependable statistical statement of the increase in the savings of the

working classes in one form or another in the last few j'ears I believe we should

be astonished and delighted. The success of benefit building societies (upon

which we have had a paper in our Section) is only one instance illustrative of this

fact. I feel, however, that I cannot leave this labour question (the condition of the

labourer in England) without one further remark, and that is some allusion to the

movement amongst the agricultural population. There, again, what a progress will.
183 REPORT-- 1873.

after all, be acknowledged by any person however much opposed to the movement.
The progress we have made is shown in Mr. Arch's meetings and Mr. Arch's

speeches : what a progress compared with the rick-burning in the southern

counties wlien I was a boy, some forty years ago ! I cannot enter into the

question now ; but I confess I am not sorry that there is a movement amongst

the agricultural population. I do not in the slightest degi-ee, in making these

remarks, blame their employers. I believe they have acted as other employers

would have done, and in some cases better, for they have been brought more

into contact with their people ; but I do think the fact of it being supposed that

no agiicultural labourer could combine with his fellow labourers did do some-

thing towards making their wages lower than those of other classes of the

community.

But in watching this movement I think we who, by our position, are not much

interested in it, should watch it with very great sympathy for both sides. The condi-
tion of the agricultural labourer is in many cases that which ought to excite our

sympathy                                                   but the position of the farmer also  is  a very dilftcult  one.  His profit
                                                        ;

is not of that nature that he can make a large increase of money payment without

a good deal of difficulty ; and I therefore think it is a favourable feature in this
movement that there is a third class somewhat connected with it (the landlords)

who are in a position which enable them to act as moderators on both sides,
and whose interests are to some extent involved in the matter. May I just throw

out a hint to the Section, that I think it would be a very good thing if a paper

--could be produced before it really bringing the laws of political economy to the

solution of this question how far the rent that is paid for land affects the question

of the wages of the agricultural labourer ?

There are only two other remarks that I would make on this matter before I

leave it, which concerns not so much the condition of England as what has

happened outside of England, but which cannot but have an effect upon Eng-

land                         and, first, it                is  this, that  if there was  an         attempt to  describe progress  in
                          ;

economical well-being for the last thirty or forty j'ears, there would be one great

fact which would be preeminent before all others--the abolition of slavery in the

United States. I am not now entering into the moral evils of slavery but it may
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

not be out of place in me to allude to what would have been the consequences to

economic science if the slave power of the South had succeeded, and in that great

country, the United States, compulsory rather than free labour had been acknow-

ledged to be the corner stone of the social system. I believe that historians will

hereafter admit that the failure of that bold and v.'ell-planned attempt to seize hold

of power in the United States in order to promote slavery was almost the greatest

escape which civilization ever had. But however much we may rejoice over that

escape, we must not forget that the spirit of slavery still exists. ^Ve hope we

may have struck some blow against slavery this year on the East Coast of Africa

but I am made more sorrowful than hopeful from what I have seen of the matter
during the last year or two. The efforts made by men of our own tongue, and,

I fear, by men of our own race, to carry on what is practicall}' a slave trade in the
Pacific Islands, are most dispiriting, and demand our earnest endeavours to check
them in every way we can. I will onlj' just allude to the attempt which is being

made in many western countries, in which there is a demand for labour, to forcibly

import Chinese coolies wherever it is possible to do so. I have, however, some hope

in regard to both these matters. I believe the moral sense of England has deter-
mined that her name shall not be shamed by the slave trade in the Pacific, and I

hope we shall do our duty in regard to this Eastern traffic. I entertain this hope

because the inhabitants of Eastern nations are becoming more and more able to

take care of themselves.

   This brings me to the other fact which, I think, we ought not to forget, and that
is the remarkable intellectual movement which is now taking place among Eastern

--nations a change which must result in great material advancement. I may allude

to the wonderful reforms in Japan, which have so far appeared to have been carried
out in real substance and with vitality of action, and which would seem to show that

--this country is waking up from the dead sleep of ages a fact which will, I think, be

hereafter acknowledged as the most extraordinary phenomenon of the last two or
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  183

three years. I tliiDk we also see something of the same tendency in China, and I
shall be surprised if we do not see some similar movement iu our own Indian posses-
sions before long. Even the recent visit of the Shah of Persia (although there was
much in it of not much reality) is, nevertheless, of itself a very interesting fact.
It is a matter of some interest to us to hnd that the despotic ruler of an Eastern
nation has thought it necessary to pay a visit to the West. It would be hard to
foresee what will be the economic results of this intellectual movement, if it
should go on increasing in extent and activity. It may cause to some extent com-

petition with our labourers ; but I believe that the general result of it will be that it

will tend enormously to the advantage of both labour and capital.
   Well, ladies and gentlemen, I have only one more remark to make before I sit

down. There was one event (one sad event) that occurred last year to which I

must allude. It would ill become me to close this address without making some

reference to the irreparable loss which economic science has sustained in the death
of Mr. Mill. That man, from whose lucid wi-itings most of us have learnt what
political economy we know, has been struck down in the full vigour of his thought,

with his power of expression undiminished. I think there is no one who would
dispute that vigour, or who would deny that in his remarkable faculty for the expo-

sition and the illustration of a trutli, John Stuart Mill was unrivalled in our time,
and hardly excelled in any other. But his loss cannot be measured by that faculty

of exposition. He was one of those who not merely explained and declared prin-
ciples, but who endeavoured to apply them. He was not content with stating
problems ; he did not shrink from the attempt to solve them. I know that many
of us would not iu all cases accept his solutions ; but who of us is there who would

--not acknowledge the perfect sincerity of his motive the absolute truthfulness of

his action ? Many of you knew him well : I had not that privilege ; but I knew
him well enough to feel that the spirit with which, in attempting to apply his

principles, he dealt with social and political questions, was so pure and noble, so

sincere and single-minded, that he spread, as it were, an ennobling atmosphere
around him, and for the time shamed away all mean intrigue and personal preju-

dice or vanity. I hope that those of us who in future try to study or to apply
those principles will alwaj's keep before us the example of the author of ' The

Principles of Political Economy.'

0)1 the Use and Abuse of Peat. Bij Major-General Sir James Alexander, C.B.

   The author described the waste of the valuable supply of peat in the county of
Perth, in Scotlaud, by floating it down the river Forth in order to obtain the use
of the clay subsoil for corn. The store of peat yet untouched was enormous, and
the facilities for dealing with it were profitable. The peat in Shetland was said to
be hard as coal, and the varieties of the Blairdrummond peat were described. The
great consumption of coal was alluded to, and the danger of exhausting the supply,
unless the export was checked by duty. The author next proceeded to describe
the Falkland Islands peat, which was used for ships of war, and noticed the uses
to which peat-charcoal was put for smelting iron. The method of working peat
by peat-a achine in Canada was shown by drawings, and a description given of the
manner of working. The author referred to the stores of peat in France which were
as yet unworked, and alluded to a peat-factory which had been forciblj' closed in
Ireland, but remarked that one was about to be erected at Dumfries.

On some of the Economical Aspects of Endounnents of Education and Original
                        Research. By C. E. Appleton, D.C.L.

   Endowments may be classified according to source, object, or extent.

    Questions arising from the consideration of the sources of these are mainly extra-
economical. Possible sources are private bequest, taxation, or a private bequest
taken in hand and reapplied by the community.
--184 REPORT 1873.

   The ohject of an endowment is always one of importance to the community, or           I

believed to he so.

   It is always an industry or employment. Institutions are only the means of

industry.

   The economical condition of the employment upon which endowment is spent

--may be: (1) self-supporting, or capable of being made so; (2) partly or tempo-

rarily incapable of maintaining itself; or (-S) wholly and permanently incapable.
   Political economy does not necessarily involve non-interference with the law of

supply and demand, but studies the effects both of interference and non-interference.

   What then are the effects of the interference with the action of supply and de-
mand involved in endowment in each of the three cases just mentioned ?

   1. Where the industry is self-supporting, or may be made so, it is to diminish

the amount of production of the particular industr}'. This is the main gTOund upon

which Adam Smith decides that the endowment of the higher education in uni-

versities is to be condemned.

 --Criticism of his views question whether secondary and university education are

or can be made self-supporting.
   Endowment running to waste where it is tmnecessary, affects also injuriously

general production. Delicate economical calculations may aiise out of this.

   2. Instances of partly self-supporting industries are primary education and tech-

nical education.

   Effect of partial endowment may be to stimulate production within the industry
endowed ; whereas without endowment it might fall to the ground altogether.

   Primary education is a condition of public security, and therefore of a healthy

economical state.

   Technical education, like improved machinery, directly increases the capacities

of producing wealth.

   It is probable, therefore, that the return of the outlay in partial endowment of
them will be greater than the diminution of wealth caused by the diversion from
self-supporting industries of the endowment fund.

  K pnmaiy or technical education ever became, by an alteration of the industrial

state of the country, self-supporting, the continued endowment of them would

then, as in the former case, involve a waste.

   It may be questioned also whether the effect of the "ladder of endowment," by

which persons are enabled to rise from lower to higher and the highest gi'ades of

education (however advantageous it may be politically to draw the elite of every
class in the community up to the top), is economically advantageous; for it tends
to draw off the best minds from particular industries, and thus to impair the power
inherent in the latter of improving themselves. The soundest economical condi-
tion, it may be contended, is when the best minds are distributed throughout the

community, and can act beneficially upon every form of production, instead of

being centralized in a single class.

   3. An industry is permanently incapable of supporting itself when the com-

modity which it produces is unsaleable. This is the case with original research in

science.

    Distinction of useful and liberal studies.

   Mill's statement that the labour of the savant is a part of production, and its en-

dowment a productive part of public expenditure, seems strictly to apply only to
those researches which render inventions and improvements of the means of pro-

duction .or distribution possible.

    Mr. George Gore's enumeration of these shows that they are mainly confined to
researches in Physics and Chemistry.

   The other physical sciences, such as Natural Histoiy, Botany, Ethnology, &c.,
and the study of letters, of language, or of history, however important in themselves,
are not in the same sense industries which have any effect upon the increase of

wealth-producing power.

   They supply, it is true, the materials of education, which, as we have seen, is a

remunerative industry ; but science, of whatever kind, is essentially an end in itself,
and therefore not in the majority of cases or necessarily a commodity, i. e. means to
any thing else.
                  TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                           185

The idea of an end in itself does not fall properly within the science of political

Aeconomy.  form of well-being, such as knowledge or culture i^er se, is one of the

ends for which all commodities or utilities exist as means.

The inference that if we endow means we should a fortiori endow the ends for

which those means exist, is a strictly valid one, but an inference not falling- within

the province of economical discussion. But the proposition from which it is an

inference may be said to be taken from political economy.

The Poor-law and its Effect on Thrift. By S. C. T. Bartley.

       0)1 Benefit Building Societies. By J. Arthur Binns,

These Societies are defined by the writer as agencies for the collection of money

to be advanced upon real securities, and 'not for the purpose of building in their

corporate capacity. There are "terminating" and "permanent" Societies, tlie

former passing out of use, the latter growing continually in influence and usefulness.
Terminating Societies labour under difficulties in equalizing the income and the

outflow of their funds, from which the permanent Societies are free.

Members may join a permanent Society, or leave it, at any time. If an investor,

a member may withdraw his money, with interest and profits ; if a borrower, lie
may repay the amount he owes. In either case his connexion with the Society is
determined by himself. There are differences in the mode of management, but not
very important ; and the " Bradford Third Equitable " may be taken as, upon the

whole, a fair representative of those successful institutions.

   This Society has 5800 members, who pay regular monthly contributions after the

rate of 10s. per share, and who receive 4^ per cent, and profits (usually 1 to I5 per
cent, more) for their money. Ten shillings per month amounts, without profits, to
£120 in 14 years and 3 months. The amount invested, or any part of it, may be
withdi-awn at any time on a month's notice, or the member may suspend his con-

tributions, and permit his money to remain at interest. This saves fines, and often
preserves money which enforced withdrawal would cause to be wasted. The fines

in 1872, on an income exceeding half a million sterling, were only £94.

  A second class of members (about 1400), who pay not less than £0 at once, pay

when they please, and are not subject to fines at all. They receive interest and

profits like the first class. Both are subject on withdrawal to a charge of one
shilling for every £5 taken out. Out of the fund so raised the management ex-

penses are paid.

  A third set of investors are "loan " depositors. They have special facilities for

withdrawal ; they receive 4 per cent, interest without profits, and they are not

charged with expenses of management.
   The Society is managed by nine Directors, a Secretary, and a Treasurei*. There

are also Solicitor, Surveyors, Auditors, and Stewards. All contributors in the first
and second classes vote in the election of these officers annually, and all are eligible

for appointment. The loan-holders, who number about 7000, are not members,

and do not vote.

The money collected is first used to meet withdrawals, and the remainder is

advanced to borrowers on security of real property. More than £'i'00,000 was so

lent in 1872. At the end of that year, the total amount actually owing to tlie

Society, and secured by 1642 mortgages, was £835,000. The total income in 1872

was £537,000, which was received in nearly a hundred thousand separate sums, and

its separate payments for withdrawals and advances numbered 16,000.

The Bradford " Second Equitable " has 6277 members, and an income of £205,000.

The "Leeds Permanent" and "Leeds Provincial" have together 17,280 members,

and an income of £565,000 ; the " Halifax Permanent " has 6167 members, and re-

ceives annually £174,000. The whole of the Societies in England and Wales are pro-
bably 2500, and the total number of members 1,000,000. The Eoyal Commissioners

Aon Building Societies describe them as " group of bodies with a subscribed capital

of over £9,000,000: a loan and deposit capital of over £6,000,000, over £17,000,000

1873.                                                                 13
186 heport--1873,

total assets, having over £10,000,000 advanced on uioitgage, and an income of over
£11,000,000."

   These Societies have grown spontaneously, rather in the absence than under the
protection of legal enactments. It is the province of Parliament to consolidate into
law the existing practice, which experience has tried and proved to be safe, in-
stead of attempting to remodel it into something altogether different, foreign to the
purpose for which the Societies have been instituted, and not adapted to meet the
wants of their members.

           Dwellinrjs for the Industrial Classes. By William Botlt.

   The author discussed sites, plans, and sanitary effects, &c. of cottages, also the
pecuniary advantages of some extensive operations, deduced from observations in
various localities and statistical returns, showing the great requirement <and its easy

accomplishment. He noticed and particularized many of the model cottages and

villages in England and Wales, those of the Society of Arts and the Prince Consort's
at the Exhibition in 1851, those of the Society for the Improvement of the Dwellings
of the Working Classes, the various companies, amongst others that of Sir Sidney
Waterlow and " The Artisans, Labourers, and General Dwellings Company," ob-
ser-\dng that the latter had propounded a scheme solving the problem long wished
for, that of erecting artisans and labourers' cottages on a plan and cost to remunerate
the builder, without being oppressive in the amount exacted from the tenant. They

--do aw.ay with the evils of overcrowding, imperfect ventilation, bad drainage and con-

Btruction not only so, but they show that a profitable return is secvired on the outlaj'.
The author then gave full particulars, illustrated by di-awings of plans, elevations, &c.
Amongst other things, he makes the following almost imperative :

    1st. South aspect (as most healthy, and in illness contributing to earlier conva-

lescence).

   2nd. The offices to be in the rear.
    3rd. No_ cottage to be allowed to be built less than 15 or 20 feet above any

neighbouring watercourse or sea-side high tide.
    4th. That each cottage should have an allotted space for a good vegetable garden,

as the cottager growing his own vegetables will teach his childi'en to weed, hoe,
&c., and will not spend his hard-earned money at a beer-house.

 On the Influence of Large Centres of Po2mlation on Intellectual Manifestation,
                                     By Hyde Claeke.

    After considering how far town populations are a means of exhausting those

 portions of the rural populations by which they are supplied, an examination was
 made of the towns, showing that there was a greater manifestation of intellectual
 vigour than in the country. This was assigned to two chief influences, one the
 extent of the population, and the other the continuous effect of educational institu-
 tions, as shown in collegiate and cathedral towns. Thus the establishment of
 large towns with adequate educational provision was treated as contributing to the
 national advancement. The gTadual development of communities in prehistoric
 times and among the lower races was referred to as illustrative of the influence
 Avhich the foundation of towns exercises in the history of civilization.

    By Frank P. Peilows, F.S.S.

    This paper gave statistics of our National Debt from the time of its commence-
ment in 1691, when it was £3,130,000, the interest being £232,000, or about 71 per

cent. ; that it rose to its highest point in 1815, when it was £861,039,000; that it

was in 1868-09 £749,314,000, since which it lias been reduced to iDetweeu

£720,000,000 and £730,000,000.
   The given Income and Disbursement for Civil, Military, and Naval expenditure

--and interest on debt were, as given in Government Account : 1832 to 1837 about

£50,000,000 yearly ; 1839 to 1843 about £52,000,000 yearlv ; 1844 to 1854 about
£57,000,000 yearly; 1855 to 1873 about £70,000,000 yearly. Since 1854 the
llevenue Departments, which up to that time only paid into the Exchequer the
net amounts earned, after paying therefrom salaries and expenses, have by Peel's

Act paid the whole amount received to the Exchequer, thus swelling the stated

income, and the salaries and expenses have been voted from the public purse.
Hence about £6,000,000 must be added to the income and disbursements of years
previous to 1854, or the figures must be raised in 1844 to 1854 from £57,000,000
to £63,000,000 in order to compare them fairly with the fiigiu-es given since Peel's
Act. Errors constantly arise from this not being known.

   Unless, however, we know also (what we do not know and what it was the object

of the paper to urge) the value of the property of the Government in land, buildings,

shops, and stores, &c., how it has increased or decreased during this period, and
how it stands year by year, these figures give no real information as to the state

of our national assets and liability or of our national current expenditure ; and the
paper was read in continuation oi' other similar papers read before this Association
and the Statistical Society of London with the view of urging that a Capital and
a Current Account should be kept in each Government Department similar to that

now being introduced at the Admiralty, so that we may know year by year what

is the real expenditure of the' Government both for investment or capital and also

for current purposes, neither of which we know now.

The Scivings-Banlc in the School. By J. G. Fitch, one of the Assistant En~

    doived Schools Co77imissioners, and Her Majesty's Ins^mtor of Schools*.

This paper consisted mainly of some facts which the author had recently gleaned

in the course of a visit to Belgium respecting the working of the " Caisses d'epargne"

in the Communal Schools of Ghent. It appeared that without any Government

influence, but merely through the energetic initiation of one of the professors in

the University of Ghent, M. Laurent, aided by the schoolmasters and mistresses,

the system of saving ha.s been very efficiently introduced into the schools ; so that

five sixths of the children in attendance have savings-bank books (livrets) and bring

their centimes regularly as they obtain them to the teachers, to be by them deposited,

as soon as the saving amounts to a franc, in the public savings-bank at 3 per cent,

interest. Ghent is a town of about three fourths of the population of Bradford

and in it the number of young people under instruction who are depositors has
steadily risen in the course of seven yeai-s to 13,032. Statistics showmg the gra-
dual growth of the system, under the watchful care of the Communal School

Council, the professors, and the elementary teachers, were given by the writer of

the paper, from which it appeared that in the Free Primary Schools there are in all

7989 scholars (boys and girls), of whom 7583 have savings-bank accounts, the

agoregate sum thus deposited amounting to 274,602 francs, or about £10,984. In

the Infant Schools {Ecoles gardiennes) there are 3039 children, of whom 1920 have

livrets, representing a sum saved of 00,523 francs or £2651. In those primaiy

Echools which are frequented by the better classes who pay for their instruction, there

are 1079 scholars, 640 of whom have deposited in all the sum of 22,687 francs or

£907 ;   and in the schools for adults, which are   partly held in the evening and
        on Sunday, there is a total number of 3285
partly                                              men and women, of whom 2889

are depositors, and whose united deposits amount to 99,252 francs or £3970. Thus,
throuo-h the agency of the scholars alone, a total sum of £18,512 has been saved,

givin^ an average of rather more than 35 francs each to 13,032 depositors. Mr.

Eitch^argued earnestly that in England the increase of wages did not increase the

permanent prosperity of the working class if it merely gave to them more leisure
and a gi'eater number of immediate gratifications, nor unless it were realized in the
form of better furniture, more books, a share in a building or cooperative store, or
some form of provision for the future, which would increase the self-respect and
dignity of the workman. Yet saving was a habit very difficult to acquire, especially

by the recipient of weekly wiiges accustomed to live from hand to mouth. It could
not be urged on the attention of workmen by employers without some suspicion of
interested motives ; it had never been stronglv encouraged by the ministers of re-

ligion; it could not well be enforced by any (jtovernment authority; it might even

be doubted whether any system of lecturing or theoretic .instruction on economics,

either in the school or in the workmen's institute, would ever be very efficacious.
Economy was an act, a habit, to be learned mainly by practising it ; and if learned
at all, it should be learned early. The school was the right place in which to

acquire this habit. Teachers and school managers were in an unusually favourable
position for helping the poor in this way. They could without difficulty open the

needful accounts with the Post-Office Savings Bank, and their motives were in no

danger of being misunderstood by the parents. The child who foregoes an imme-
diate indulgence, who saves his halfpence in order to procure a better equipment of
books, clothes, or tools on leaving school, and who experiences the delight of finding
interest begin to accrue when his saving amounts to a shilling, has learned a lesson
in self-restraint and forethought which will abide with him for life. The paper

concluded with the description of some of the details by which the introduction of
the plan might be facilitated with the help of teachers, members of school boards,
and others, and by the expression of a strong wish that the experiment so success-
fully made in Ghent might be studied and imitated in England.

     On the East Morley and Bradford Savings-Bank. By Thomas Haig.

   This savings-bank was opened in the year 1818. The town being then very

small, its early progress was slow. It had reached its climax in May 18G4, when

32,500 persons had deposited £1,273,363, including interest, and there remained in

the bank £248,396 due to about 10,000 depositors. From that time to November

1869 the bank declined at the average rate of five to six thousand pounds a year,
owing to the reduced rate of interest and the narrowed limits as to the amount of
deposits; while depositors would readily avail themselves to any extent of other
modes of investment at a higher rate of interest.

   To stay its further decline and extend its usefulness no course seemed open but

to adopt the suggestion of the Savings-Bank Act, and to open a department for the
receipt of deposits for investment on other securities upon which a higher rate of
interest could be paid. Accordingly, rules having been prepared, adopted, and

certified, the new department was opened in April 1870 for the receipt of larger

amounts on interest at 4 per cent, per annum, with power to withdraw twenty
pounds without notice once in three months, and larger sums after notice propor-
tioned to their amounts.

  Up to the 13th September, 1873, 3257 accounts had been opened in this depart-

ment, on which 10,736 deposits had been made, and 4001 withdrawals. Tlio
amount of deposits (with interest to April last) was £274,245 13s. 10(/., and the
withdrawals £65,559 7s., leaving £208,686 Qs. lOd. due to 2763 depositors.

   Of this sum £160,000 in various amounts had been invested with the Bradford
Corporation for limited periods at A\ per cent, per annum. Other sums had boon

advanced on mortgage of real property, under the direction of a Finance Committee,
assisted by an eminent firm of solicitors and an experienced professional valuer.

   The two departments are kept perfectly distinct, and together meet the require-
ments of the class of depositors whose benefit was contemplated by the Legislature
in the Savings-Bank Acts.

             Educational Statistics of Bradford. By James Hanson.

   The object of this paper is to furnish a brief statistical accoiint of the state of
education in Bradford. The term education is employed to denote the ordinary
agencies concerned in imparting knowledge and promoting culture in the earlier

periods of life. After giving a brief history of the establishment of day schools in
Bradford, the author considers the question of what number of children ought to be
under instruction in Bradford. The Eegistrar-General estimates that in the middle

of the present year the population of the borough would be 156,609. At 2.31 per
1000, between the ages of three and thirteen years, we shall have in the borough

30,170 children of school age. Deducting 10 per cent, for sickness and other causes,
there remain 32,553 of school age, constituting the gross number that ought to be

under instruction. What are the facts of the case ? One seventh of the children

between three and thirteen belong to the middle and upper classes. Taking one

seventh from 32,553, we have 27,903 as the number of children of the poorer classes

that require to be educated in schools where the fee is less than ninepence per week.
   The number of children in the fifty public elementary schools which exist in

Bradford are then given, the total on the books being 15,434. The number of
childi-en in the 65 private adventure schools was found to be, in 1871, 2866 ; and it is
estimated that the number is the same at the present time. This gives a total
nimiber of childi-en in schools where the weekly fee is less than Qd. as 22,300. It

has been found on inquiry, however, that of the seventh part of the entire juvenile
population belonging to the upper and middle classes, 4650 in number, only 2517 are

provided for by middle-class schools, private tuition, &c. ; and it may fairly be

concluded that the balance, 2133, are educated in the public elementary schools.

"We must then add the 2133 to the number that require to be provided for in public
elementary schools. The figures amended will then stand thus :

Children between three and thirteen of the working class  27,903
Children sent to popular schools by well-to-do people       2,133

                                      Total               30,036
                                                          22,300
Children actually in popular schools

Left without day-school instruction                       7,736

   It must especially be borne in mind that the figures we have hitherto been deal-

ing with simply represent the children on the school-register. Nothing is told us

about the character of the education that is being receivedby these 22,300 children

and yet this is a most vital point in attempting to ascertain the state of education
in a community. With one exception the adventure-schools of this kind were in

1871 deemed mefficient by the Inspector of Returns, and were not taken into
account at all in reckoning the school provision of the borough. As to the educa-

tion given in the advanced schools, the author believes it to be equal to that of

similar schools in any part of the kingdom ; and in the last twenty years the
standard of teaching in these schools has been very materially advanced. Coming
to the education obtained in the popular elementaiy schools, we must take into
consideration several circumstances. 1. In the first place, the difference between

the numbers on the registers of the schools and the average attendance is very

great. The numbers on the registers of the fifty schools are, as we have seen,

19,434, while the average attendance only amounts to 12,028. Here is an elimi-

nation of 7400 children at once. An able inspector, Mr. Fitch, has remarked that

" it cannot be said of a school that it is, in any efi'ective sense, educatmg a larger
number than that represented by its average attendance." The Bradford schools,
therefore, cannot be said to be really educating more than 12,028 children out of

the 19,434 on the books. The others are irregular attenders, that gam httle good
from their casual visits. 2. The diflerence between the registers and the average

attendance is rendered so large owing to the presence of a great number of half-

timers in the Bradford schools. This feature must be deemed a hindrance to the

effective education of the children of the working classes. There are in the schools
of the borough about COOO half-timers. The system can only be accepted as a boon
--190 REPORT 1873.

where parents and society are indifferent to the education of children, and would
otherwise systematically neglect it. Its educational value has been overrated.
Reporting on this district in 1870, Mr. School-Inspector Wilde justly remarks that

--its advantage is the regular attendance which it ensures where work is regular

but he observes : " The disadvantage of the system is that parents, knowing their
children will be obliged to attend school when they begin to work, do not send
them while young, on the plea that when they go to the mill they will get their
schooling." 3. The character of the education imparted in the elementary schools
would be most clearly shown if we could know how lon^ the children remain at

school, and what progress they make in their studies. We want to know what

proportion of the 12,028 are presented for examination, what they are examined in,
what they know of each subject, and what is the mental culture effected. The
atithor cannot give exact information on these points. The inspector for the district,

--Mr. Baily, has kindly supplied the following facts : In the forty schools he in-

 spected between September 1872 and March 1873 iu Bradford the average attend-

 ance was 10,333 ; the number qualified for examination 7601 ; actually presented
 for examination 6319; number of passes, in reading 5092, in writing 5270, in
 arithmetic 3859, in one special subject 169, a second special subject 87. Thus out

 of the ten thousand in average attendance, only 3859 pass in arithmetic in all the

 standards. The inspector is unable to give the numbers in each standard. As
 a substitute for such specific information, it may assist us to an approximate con-

 clusion if we assume that the Bradford elementary schools are equal to the average

 of such schools throughout the country. Applying to the statistics of the Bradford

 schools the proportions that we find exemplified in the last report of the department
 for the whole of the inspected schools of England and Wales, we should nave the

 following results. Out of the average attendance in our fifty elementary schools of

 12,028, there would be :--

Qualified for examination           ,              8334
                                                   7000
Actually presented for examination                 5608

Presented in the first three standards, I. to III  1243

       or 82 per cent.

mPresented the upper three standards, TV. to VI

or 18 per cent.

That is, out of 19,434 on the registers, and 12,028 in average attendance, only 1243
would be presented in Standards IV., V., and VI., while 5698 are presented in the

earlier standards. Further, as to those that would pass without failure in any sub-
ject. According to the same proportions, the Bradford schools would pass in
Standards I. to III., 3528, and in Standards IV. to VI., 690; that is, out of 19,434
on the registers, and 12,028 in average attendance, only short of 700 would be

insti-ucted sufficiently to be able to pass without failure in the higher standards.

Now, when we remember that the highest standard only requires in arithmetic a

knowledge of proportion, fractions, and decimals, and a corresponding proficiency
in reading and writing, these facts indubitably show what a miserable state our
system of education is in. 4. In trying to form a judgment of the character of the

education supplied in the public elementary schools in this town, there is one other
feature of the general system that must just be mentioned, although its workings

cannot be brought out here. The author refers to the inherent tendency of fostering
mechanical teaching, mere memoriter knowledge and cramming, rather than the
acquisition of accurate knowledge, the unfolding of the faculties, and the framing
of these to right habits of thought. It would be interesting to know what is the
cost of the agencies which achieve these meagi-e results. This cannot be given
exactly. Out of the fifty elementary schools now in existence, thirty-eight gained
Government grants last year ; the rest are seeking for these gi-ants. These thirty-
eight schools got £6883 17s. lOf^. from the Imperial fund last year, and for the
operations of the yeai- the fifty schools will obtain from £8000 to £9000 of the
parliamentary vote. This large amount of public money is spent in Bradford on

what are called " efficient " schools. No teachers, however competent, can secure

a really good education without a regular, continuous attendance for a series of years
on the part of the children, Oiu* system fails because it wants the condition las

mentioned; its effects are not permanent; they are so meagre and superficial that,
to a large extent, they are lost : they are evanescent and unfruitful ; and on this

account the system is exceedingly costly, without a commensurate return. If tested

by economic principles, the system would he pronounced unsound and wasteful.
In reference to school accommodation in Bradford, many of the schools would
accommodate more than are in attendance. The present provision in the elementary
schools is for 21,171 children. The eight schools that are being built by the Scho^ol

Board will accommodate 4800 more ; so that there will be accommodation for 2.5,971

--say 26,000. It has been shown that there are 30,036 childi-en requiring accommo-

dation ; but if we deduct 3000 for half-timers, we shall have 27,036 as the ^ross
number of children who require accommodation, with a provision of 26,000. There

is, however, accommodation for about 3000 in the private adventure schools. Passing

now to evening schools and classes, there are a great number of night schools held

in private houses and private schools, of which no statistics can be given. In the
public institutions and elementary schools, a list of which is given, it was found

that there were on the books last year 3027 students, with an average attendance
of 16-57. Art- and science-classes have greatly increased of late years through the

Aencouragement extended by the Government. detailed table of the statistics for last

year of all the classes of both art and science in the borough, the subjects studied,
the number uuder instruction, and the number examined, shows the following

--results : That 595 persons were uuder instruction in art, and 465 of these were

examined. In science 564 were under instruction, with G13 individual examinations.
It thus appears that in the science and art classes together 1159_persons have been
instructed. Another educational agency in extensive operation in Bradford is that

of Sunday schools. From the statistics supplied in the paper, it appeared that
there are on the books of all the Sunday schools in the borough 31,460 children

and young persons, with an average attendance of about 21,000. Statistics as to
the Public Libraries of the town were given, and show that in the libraries of the
Mechanics' Institute, Church Institute, Female Educational Institute, and the Free
Library, there are 32,226 volumes, with issues last year amounting to 156,000.

And then we must not forget the interesting fact that almost every one of the

eighty-six Sunday schools has a library for the use of the children and teachers

and these contain altogether about 47,000 volumes.

                        By B. Hatjghxon, C.E., F.S.S.

The author said that the railways of England had now settled down into some-

thiii"- like a complete and efficient system, suitable for the necessities of the

country. Their cost had been something like £600,000,000, and the period of
time occupied in their construction had been, dating from the commencement of

the construction of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (1826), forty-seven

years. The trunk lines were finished, and the question arose. What next ? The
answer was natural ; let them arrange and control and manipulate this vast machi-
nery so as to produce symmetry and order out of the seemingly chaotic mass, and

coasting, steam, and sailing vessels competing with the railways, the docks and

harbours owned by the railways, locomotive factories, coach and waggon factories,

the coal- and other mines used by the railways. With reference to the economy

of working under State control, the author regarded it as extremely problema-
tical. The number of journeys made in 1871 in the United Kingdom was

375,000,000 exclusive of those made by season-ticket holders, of whom there

were 188,392 ; and he estimated that the total number of journeys made in the

vear was 409,000,000. During the same period one passenger only was killed for

each 13,630,000 jomneys made ; and assuming that each passenger made seventy-

live journeys per annum, and that he was endowed with the faculty to renew

his life at pleasure, he could only be killed once in 181,733 years of travelling.

And supposing that the wounded by railway collisions were to be killed in the

ratio of ten to one, a passenger could only be wounded once in 18,000 years.

Tliese and other figures proved that there was practically no danger for the

railway traveller either of being killed or wounded in a railway collision. It was

to the nearly superhuman eftbrts of railway officials, high and low, as well as to

the inventive genius of the engineer, that the passenger owed his comparative

safety ; and he might feel assured that State management would not diminish the
present death-rate. Having reviewed the objections usually raised against the

status quo, the author considered those generally made against adopting the op-

posite horn of the dilemma, viz. Government management. Centralization of

control had some advantages, but they were not such as to neutralize its short-

comings. It was because he was convinced that it was beyond the intellectual

capacity of this country as in this epoch limited, to manage a network of railways

13,000 miles in extent on the principle of unification under State control and

in accordance with the present wants, that he advocated a system of railway groups

as against a Government or centralized management. It was clear that the State

could not enter into a carrying competition with independent companies. The ob-

jections to expropriation on the ground of patronage required no further notice

than this, that the companies employed about 250,000 persons, the nomination of

whom to their several ofiices would bring with it doubtless the possession of their

sufli-ages. It was questionable if the railway property could De bought for less

than a thousand millions, if even it could be done at that figure. Truly the friends

of expropriation must be endowed with a romantic boldness of entei-prise, and a

faith that would remove mountains. The scheme he had to place before the Asso-

ciation started upon the principle that it was the duty of the Government to

govern, and not to trade                                                                                                                 and it adopted, as a foregone conclusion, that                                                                  the                                                                                State

ought not, and could not if it would, buy and manage the railways. The inten-

tion of the scheme was that the existing railways, owned at present by 106

ditlerent companies, should be amalgamated into four competitive groups, to be
owned and managed by four great companies, taking their shape and direction

from the people of the island, and having a due regard to the terrain as well as to

the importance of the chief centres of trade and manufacturing towns, cities, mines,

docks, ports, harbours, and so forth, as well as to the status of each principal

railway company. He suggested that the four amalgamated groups should pre-

--serve the titles of four of the existing companies : (1) the London and North-
Western group                                                                                the                                         Great Western                                                group
                                                                                     ;  (2)                                                                                                                                    ;  (3)  the   Great Northern   group
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

(4) the Midland gTOup. Neutral territories, except in a verj' few instances, had

no place in the scheme, as being contrary to its principles, those of competition

pure and simple. The London and North-Western group would absorb the London

and North-Western, Lancashire and Yorkshire, Cambrian, Mid Wales, Caledonian,

Great North of Scotland, South Staflbrd, London, Brighton, and South Coast, and

some of the smaller networks to South Wales, Shrewshury, and Hereford (jointly),

and the Cheshire lines (jointly). The Great Western gTOiip he would compose

of the Great AVestern, South-Western, Shrewsbury and Hereford (jointly),

Cheshire lines (jointly), South-Eastern and some of the smaller lines in South

Wales. The Great Northern group would combine the Great Northern, Great

Eastern, North-Eastern, North British, and the Highland (jointly). The Midland

group would consist of the Midland, Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire,.

Glasgow and South-Western Highland (jointly), Brecon and Merthyr, Bristol and

Exeter, and London, Chatham, and Dover. The four systems might in the fulness

of time become practically four distinct railway networks, each one visiting the

most important commercial centres of the kingdom, and each independent, or

Whennearly so, of the others.  the systems had attained such a condition, it

might be said that the absolute perfection of the scheme had arrived : that was

to say, a choice of four difl'erent routes would be oftered to any person travelling

from one place of importance to any other place of importance. The author

proceeded to enumerate the advantages of the system he had thus sketched out.

                   Commercial Panics. By W. D. Hendeeson.

   The writer considered the whole question of banking on the " historic method,"
and showed how it was that various laws had from time to time checked the

natural development of the business of banking. He then pointed out tliat of all
trades banking was the one which ought to be freest, as it dealt not with commo-

dities, but with the representatives of commodities and the credit of individuals.

After pointing out how it had happened that in England the capital of the banks

was small in proportion to their liabilities, and the specie also small, and that the
Bank of England held the entire specie reserves of the country, he proceeded to
point out that the remedy for the small capital was now in the hands of individuals,

who could either singly or in combination, or in the latter case, under either the
Limited Liability Act or the unlimited, form what banks they pleased. As regards
augmenting the specie reserves he showed that this also was largely in the power
of the banks, and that what was required was chiefly that the London banks should

form a fimd of specie to which each would require to contribute, and settle their
clearing-house transactions, not by cheques on the Bank of England, but by

cheques on this fund. He showed how the possession of this fund would steady

the action of the banks in times of pressure, and that it would be open to the
banks, if a great emergency arose, to hand its amount, which would probably be

4,000,000, to the Bank of England. He then considered the one exception to the

general principle of free trade, and admitted that the issue of small notes was
really a monopoly, as the holders of these notes were involuntary creditors. The
assumption of the Act of 1844 was examined, viz. that a circulation of notes
should fluctuate as one of gold would do ; and it was shown that this was impos-

sible, and that in Scotland, for example, between May and July, there was a varia-

tion in the circulation of 10 per cent, from what the small note circulation might

be expected to be on this theory, and what it actually was. He advocated the

issue of these notes by the State, provided that the State held a large reserve of
specie to secure their controvertibiiity. The amount of sovereigns in circulation

was now about £75,000,000, and probably notes issued by the State would take
their place to the extent of £-50,000,000. Of this sum one half might be kept in

gold and the other half in consols; and of course, as no interest would be payable
on consols, the State would make a profit yearly of 3 per cent, on £25,000,000, or
 £750,000 a year. The writer then pointed out that in times of panic a portion of

this gold might be rendered available. On the principle of the Bank Act of 1844, if
the normal circulation was £50,000,000, it was inconceivable that it should ever

 fall below £.30,000,000 ; and the First Lord of the Treasury and the Cliancellor of
 the Exchequer might have power to sell, say, £1,500,000 of gold, and purchase
 consols for every 1 per cent, that the Bank rate rose above 8 per cent. There

 would thus be a margin of £5,000,000 from the small note department, viz. the
 difierence between £25,000,000 ordinarily held of consols and the £30,000,000
 194- BEPOKT--1873.

 wliicli might he lield, and in addition £4,000,000 from the London Clearing House
 available to allay a panic, and this without any loss to the country, which would
 indeed have £21,000,000 of gold to export. The writer then repeated his view

 that, except small notes, there should be complete fi-eedom in banking, taking rea-
 sonable precautions to prevent fraud, and pointing out that it would be well to

 allow all new banks, or banks not now circulating, to issue notes of £20 and up-
 wards, as their notes circulated among the wealthier classes, who were qiute able
 to take care of themselves. He believed that with freedom in banking the banks

 would be larger and with larger capital, and safer than at present, and that ex-
 treme mercantile convulsions could be avoided, although, of course, pressures
 arising from men's imprudence might always be expected *.

                       Oil the Shoddi/ Trade. By Samuel Jubb.

    The shoddy manufacture was commenced at Batley, Yorkshire, in the year 1813,
being introduced by Mr. Benjamin Law, of the same place. The produce thereof
are heavy woolleji cloths chiefly, and they are used for coatings and other purposes.
The essential raw materials used in the fabrication of shoddy cloths are shoddy
and mungo, in combination with wool and noils.

    Shoddy is produced from soft rags, such as cast-off stockings, flannels, carpets,
&c. ; and mungo from hard rags, such as worn-out dress-coats, tailors' cuttings,
disused fine tablecloths, &c. Both these kinds of rags, whicli formerly were
nearly valueless, are torn or grouud up by a machine, the principal feature of which
is a cylinder set with sharp iron teeth, and which revolves at a rapid rate; this
machine is known locally by the name of "devil." The effect is, that the rags
are converted into a kind of wool or flock, and hence capable of being mixed with

sheep's wool.

    The supplies of rags are drawn partly from the large cities and tovras of the
LT^nited Kingdom, and also from various foreign countries. London is the jjrincipal
market. Shoddy and mimgo, viz. the rags in the prepared state, are largely
imported from the continent of Europe.

   Shoddy varies from Id. to Is. per lb., mungo from 1 \d. to 20d. per lb., according
to quality, colour, staple, «S:c. The wool used together with shoddy varies from
Qd. per lb. to ISd. per lb., and with mungo from Is. to 2s. C(/. or .'is. per lb.

   There is a large quantity of fine Australian wool consumed in the shoddy
manufacture.

   Shoddy cloths vary from about Is. 2d. to 12s. per yard, 64 inches wide, and
always appear cheap, whilst as a fact they are an economical fabric, and as such
extensively patronized by the working and poorer classes at home ; at the same
time a large export trade is done in them to our colonies and the principal markets

of the world.

   Shoddy cloths are of course scribbled and carded, spun, woven, milled, raised,
dyed, and finished much in the same way as cloths made of all sheep's wool.

   The shoddy manufacture has its centre at Batley and the adjoining borough of
Dewsbury, where large mills are in operation, employing thousands of workpeople.
Batley is the principal seat of the trade, and at this time (1873) contains from
fifty to sixty mills engaged in this business.

  A considerable number of other places in the district, and at a distance, are

more or less occupied in the heavy wooUen manufacture, which have radiated from
Batley as from a common centre. There are no statistics showing the extent of
the trade in the aggTegate, though it is desirable there were ; it may, however, be
stated that there are without doubt 3000 power-looms used in this trade at Batley.
Speaking of power-looms (that is to say looms driven by steam-power, in contra-
distinction to hand- looms, which were worked manually) they (power-looms) have

   * It is a little curious that remedies almost identical with what is suggested liere were

adopted a day or two afterwards in New York. The banks there ceased to conduct their

exchanges against legal tender, and the Government bought lands ; and in each case the
amounts were similar to what is hero indicated, viz, ^4,000,000 and Xr>,000,000 re-

spectively.
                       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  195

been iiaoil ou a large and increasing scale for some twenty years back ; females are
chieHy engaged in tending power-looms, intermixed with a few yonng and adult

men. Female labour has been in great demand in the heavy woollen district since
the introduction of power-looms ; and the result is that this hind of labour now
receives about twice the remuneration it formerly did. Men's wages, though ad-
vanced, have not progressed in any thing like a corresponding ratio ; females who
are proficient at the power-loom can earn in full employ eighteen shillings per

Aveek. The employment in the woollen manufacture is, generally speaking, healthy
the oil, which is put upon the wool before scribbling, keeps down any dust, and is

wholesome to the operative.
   In conclusion, the trade seems destined to expand in future years as it has done

in the past, and to become, large as it is, much larger still. In its first initiation,
and for some time afterwards, the trade was not without detractors ; but it has

outlived all opposition, and has become fii-mly established as one of the leading

mamifactiu'es  of the  kingdom.
                              -"D

 Confederated Homes and Cooperative EoiiseJceepinff. By Mrs.^E, M. King*.

   In a short introduction the writer showed that the proverbial attachment of
Englishmen to their homes was not so deep as was supposed ; neither were the

comforts of home extended to all members of society. Men in easy circumstances
frequented clubs, ladies left home for balls and parties ; men in a poorer class re-
sorted to public-houses, institutes, &c. ; the women, when they could, went out for
a little gossip. The large nnmber of single men and women living in boarding-
houses and lodgings proved that home was to them little more than a name.

   One well-known cause of the discomfort of home was the want of good servants.
Some considered the mistresses to blame for them, some the servants; the happy-
medium people said both were to blame ; while she (Mrs. King) considered that
neither were to blame, but thought that the position in which mistress and ser-

vant were placed with regard to one another caused this discomfort, producing
discontent on the part of the servants, and the assumption of responsibility by
mistresses as to the life and conduct of their servants, which they could only
carry out by depriving the servants of nearly all liberty and free enjoyment of life.

   The discontent of servants was owing to the state of semislavery in which they
were kept. Mrs. King urged that servants should be placed in the altered condi-

--tion of free workers ; and in order to effect this, the home of the employer should

no longer be the home of the employed that is, that servants shoiddno longer live
in our houses. In order to efl:ect this change, our system of living in isolated homes
 must be given up, and one of cooperative housekeeping be substituted ; and instead
 of one set of servants working all day and, as occurred often, far into the night, re-
 lays of servants should come for a certain number of hours and be replaced by

 others.

    Mrs. King called attention to the want of proper schools of cookery, and declared
 that the attempt to teach it by lectures or showing how to make a few dishes must

 prove a failm-e, the art and science [of cookery being a branch of technical instruc-

 tion requiring study and constant practice.

    With regard to the mechanical arrangements of the homes, the best machinery for
 economizing labour should be made use of ; but it would be better not to attempt

 to obtain luxuries, the most perfect organization for the supply of the necessaries

--of domestic life being one of the greatest luxuries these mechanical arrange-

 ments being for heating, lighting, water-supply, and waste-pipes (speaking-tubes,
 ventilation), and " lifts."

    As water should be carried into all rooms where required, so should all waste

 matter be conveyed out of rooms by a turn of the hand of the occupier of the room.

 Domestic service was made degrading by giving women degrading work to per-
 form, and so effectually preventing women of higher class entering into it.

     Mrs. King advocated the education of boys and girls together, and affirmed
 that in a home ou the plan she recommended a school could be attached in

             * Published in exten^o in the ' Contemporary Review ' for December 1873.
--196 KEPORT 1873.

wliich the system of " mixed education " could be best tried, as the parents
could then daily watcli the effect it had upon the character and behaviour of their

children.

   In conclusion, Mrs. King said, ''The plan of home, domestic and social, life
I have endeavoured in this paper to explain is a wide one, one which, if car-

--ried out, would result in many wide reforms in the emancipation of a class,

in organizing- the whole range of female domestic labour, in founding schools
for technical education in the newly organized profession, in producing tenfold
more order, ease, and comfort in home-life, in reducing the cost of living, in

opening a tield of honourable employment to women of all classes, in offering

the best means for the care and education of children, and, lastlj', showing a
remedy leading to the greater purity and elevation of our social intercourse.

And however 1 may have failed in workiug out the details of my plan, it is one

well worth our earnest consideration and attention."

On the Bradford Building Trades. By Archibald Neill.

The building-stone trade of Bradford and district is considerable in extent, there

being about fiOOO men engaged in stone-getting and dressing in the quarries in the

locality. The produce is about 450,000 tons per annum, and something like

£050,000 in value. The men have no trades' union, but have as short hours as,

and are better paid than, the workmen employed in the building-trade who have

trades' unions. They have seldom much difliciilty in obtaining an advance of wages

or other requests, as they are guided by the state of the trade. When they see a

good demand for the stone they understand that to be their opportunity, and each

set of workmen asks their employer or master for an advance of wages, shorter hours

of labour, or other advantages ; and they have so timed their applications that the

quarry masters have found it possible to comply with them, and that without injury

to the trade ; for although these men have shorter hours and are better paid than
any other men similarly employed in any part of this country, yet the stone found

in this district, being highly appreciated and much used, the trade has improved
notwithstanding the repeated advances made to the workmen. As a large propor-

tion of the stone (fully one half) is sent off by rail or water to London, Manchester,

Liverpool, Birmingham, and other places equally distant from Bradford, the in-

crease of wages to the workmen in this trade is all to the advantage of the Bradford

district, and will be so until the high wages modify or destroy the demand for

the stone. The stone in this neighbourhood is of the sandstone order, but of

various qualities. There is the ordinary coarse sandstone, known to engineers as

the Bramley Fall, and the white beds of Calverley, and the finer qualities of ashlar,

such as Clitf AVood, Bolton Wood, Wrose Hill, and Idle, of which most of our large

warehouses are built. When these stones are used in buildings set on their natural

bed, they will last for ages. The delfstone or fine riving sandstone is also found

in great abundance, in layers from 1 inch to 30 inches in thickness, and in large posts

or slabs. These can be split into a variety of thicknesses, according to the natural

vents or beds of the stone. When split in this way the bed is true, and flags,

landings, steps, or other flat stones are obtained with little labour ; and if worked

while fresh, the labour is easily executed ; but when dry, it becomes hard and

Adifhcult to work with hammer and chisel.  great number of the men employed
                               TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.          l97

at the quarrlea are engaged in working as masons, preparing flags, steps, sills, land-

ings, and a variety of masons' work. These men work mostly by piece or contract,

and earn from 30s. to £3 per week. The stone so prepared, except a portion of

the flags and landings, is all sent out of Bradford, as the Bradford Building Trades'

Union masons object to stone so dressed being used in this district.

There is little machinery at work in the stone trade of this district as j^et ; for

although stone-dressing and moulding-machines have been at work on the Bath,

Portland, and other soft stones in the southern counties, they are not adapted to

work the hard stone of this district. Little progress has been made in dressing

Bradford stone by machinery, the great grindiug-power of the stone on any tool

being a considerable difficulty. Low speed can only be used, and the result is slow

progress with the work. Yet something is done in this way, and at half the cost

of hand-labour. [The author has constructed a dressing-machine for cutting and

squaring stone, and also a rubbing-machine for dressing quoins and plane sur-

faces                          a full description of these machines was given to the Mechanical Section of
                            ;

this Association.] At present few masters have iuti'oduced machinery into their

workshops; and at present not more than 10 per cent, of this class of work is

done by machinery. The small amount of scaffolding used by builders in Brad-

ford is a peculiaritj', and must attract the attention of strangers. Our large mills

and warehouses are raised without the aid of the forest of poles or heavy timbers

to be seen in other large towns. There are about 1400 building masons in

Bradford. They are nearly all in the union. They have 7|</. per hour, and work

49^ hours per week. They discourage overtime ; and it is very seldom resorted

to, it being felt in Bradford, both by master builders find men, that 49| hours is

sufficient labour for any week, and not more than nine hours in any one day.

There are about 1000 carpenters and joiners, machine-joiners, and steam-sawyers

in Bradford. One half are in trades' unions ; and, so far as the author can form an

opinion, the better class of workmen in this case are unionists ; and he has never

known the union interfere except for good. Their wages are 7id. per hour, time

and overtime, as in the case of masons. They have always welcomed the use of

machinery, and made the best of it. Much good machinery has been introduced

into this trade ; and Bradford is not behind any town in the country for the quality

and variety of the machinery in use, some being as yet in exclusive use here. All

the heavy work in carpentry (roof-framing, floors, dovetailing of beams, joists, &c.),

as well as all the heavy work in joinery, is done by machinery in a first-class

manner, making the labour of the joiner easy, care and skill being more in request

than hard work. The machinery in this trade executes fully 60 per cent, of the

--labour in preparing carpenters' and joiners' work (the fixing, of course, having still

to be done by hand-labour) the result being that although wages have risen in

this trade upwards of 60 per cent, during the last twenty years, yet the price of

finished work, exclusive of fixing, is not more than it was before that time. "We

have 260 plasterers in Bradford. They are nearly all in the union. They are paid

7^(1 per hour, and work 50^ hours per week. There are about 200 plumbers and

glaziers and 50 slaters, with hours and pay similar to those of the joiners. There

are 750 masons' labourers, all in the union. They are paid6f/. per hour, and work

495 hours per week. There are about 1300 men engaged as excavators, carpenters'

labourers, and assisting the other trades ; and, with the exception of 120 plasterers'
labourers, they are not in the union ; but the average wages will be about the same

as the union labourers, and their hours of labour the same as those of the respective

trades with which they are connected. There are about 400 painters, paid G^d. per

hour grainers and ornamental writers from 7d. to Od. per hour.        They work 52J
                        ;

hours per week, and overtime as required. There are 300 smiths and mechanica

directly connected with the building and stone trade. They have the same hours

as the joiners and masons, and receive 7cZ. per hour. About one half are in the

union. There is little clay for hand brick-making in this district, it being largely

mixed with stone and shale. Machinery has had to be resorted to for grinding,

either in the dry or plastic state. After being ground in a plastic state, it is some-

times moulded by hand, sometimes by machinery ; but when ground drj, of course

it is always moulded or compressed into brick by machinery. There are about 600

men and lads engaged iu this trade, their working hours being the same as masons,
198 REPORT-- 1873.

The lads have 2^(1, per hour, the men bhl, and some arc paid hy the piece, and
make on the average 8d. per hour. All the bricks are burned in Iloflinan's,

Morand's, Baker's, or other permanently built kilns. Tho.?e kilns do not emit

smoke, and are therefore well adapted for burning bricks in towns. They also

economize coal, the saving compared with the manner of burning bricks before

their introduction here being equal to 300 per cent, in value. Still bricks are 30

per cent, dearer than they were twenty years ago, arising out of the expensive

plant, higher rate of coal and wages, and the greater care taken in their ma-

nufacture, the bricks being of a superior quality than formerly. Although stone

is largely in use in this district, even for the conmionest purposes, yet the number

of briclcs used and the amount of capital employed is a hundred times greater

than twenty years ago. The author estimates that the turnover in the trades

for the erection of buildings in Bradford only amounts to about £850,000 per

annum. There is considerable capital invested in the trade ; and Bradford builders

have a fair reputation for good work, and frequently extend their operations to

places at a great distance, the woodwork being almost all made liere, and in

some instances the stone has been di-essed and fitted for large buildings sixty

miles away.

The want of well-instructed men as masters, foremen, and leading men being

strongly felt in the trade, induced the master builders of Bradford in ISGOto esta-

blish a trade technical evening school for the young men engaged in the business.

The object of the school is to instruct the men in a scientific knowledge of their

trade                        but  it  has                                  been  found  necessary to have                                                                                                   classes for reading, writing, and
                          ;

arithmetic, as numbers of the apprentices have been neglected in their elementary

education, and it is hard to teach technical science to those who read with diffi-

position with our technical education. The class of instruction given and required

seems not to have been understood by the Science and Art Department ; and up to

now they have ignored the most important knowledge, that knowledge which will

enable a workman correctly, scientifically, and in the best manner to obtain the

true lines from which he can with confidence produce the most complicated piece

of work, such as wreaths, twists, curves, and other forms required in staircases,

needed by a first-class workman, and it is, so far as the author knows, a know-

ledge peculiarly their own. It has not been taught in schools. Architects,

as a class, know very little of it ;                                                    it is workmen's                                                                                                     lore                      it has  been  left to  them,

and some 10 per cent, of workmen have a fair knowledge of such subjects

yet few, if any, are what 90 per cent, might be if such schools ns the Bradford

Builders' Technical Schools existed throughout the country. The Government

Examiners for Certificates in Building Construction, so far as can be perceived, are

imacquainted with the existence of this peculiar scientific workmen's geometry:

--and it would be well if they were to take counsel with men who are practically

engaged in our technical schools men who not only theorize, but go into actual
Wepractice in the school.

struction. If pur pupils are studying the skew bridge, circular upon circular arch,

wreaths of wooc^or stone, roof construction, or such like, the bridge or arch is con-

structed as a practical illustration of the geometric principle or theory. Technical

schools can never have efficient help from Government until this technical know-

ledge is better understood by the Science and Art Department. Architectural

students in it ; but in this difficult, and to workmen more important branch of

scientific technical drawing' there is no help whatever. The author states that

from the opening of the school an average of fifty yoimg men have attended

the classes four nights a week from seven to nine o'clock. The charge is from 3s.

to 5s. per quarter. The majority of tlie masters pay for their apprentices. The

schools can accommodate a much larger number than attend, yet the results

are good. Young men are being properly educated for managers, foremen, or first-

as a better workman. Some say if you educate men they will not work. This is

so if they are educated 7wt to work. If it is impressed on a lad in his training that

he is to have an education to save him from working he will not work ; but if, on

the other baud, he is brought up with the idea that he must have an education

when a boy that it may enable him to work when a man, to work with intelli-

gence and skill, then it will be found tliat he is more industrious than he who

received little or no education. Those who fear that educated workmen will not

work are very frequently the same men who cry out against the shortening of the

hours of labour, and hold out the increasing competition with Germany and German

workmen as a reason why we should continue the long hours and increase our

industiy in every possible manner so that we may preserve our country's trade

and commerce. Do they forget that these strong competitors are all educated,

and far above what we in this country are likely to be for years to come ? Is it

not our want of education we have to fear ?

On the Relation of the Banl-inr/ Reserve of the Banl- of Enf/land to the Current

             Rate of l7iterest*. By E. H. Inglis Palgkate, F.S.S.

This paper gives a complete analysis of the returns respecting the Bank of

England in the Appendix of the Eeport from the Select Committee of the House

of Commons on the Bank Act of 1857, and the one published this year, containing

a similar statement, continued to the close of 1872. By following out this analysis,

it becomes clear that the average rate of discoimt charged by the Bank of England

depends in general terms on the proportion borne by the reserve of the Bank to the

liabilities. Between 1844 and 1872 the average deposits of the Bank have risen

from £13,000,000 to £28,000,000, the banking reserve from £8,000,000 to
£12,000,000, the balance of London bankers from £900,000 to £7,000,000, the

average of bills discounted from £4,000,000 to £6,000,000, temporarj' advances

from £1,000,000 to £3,000,000, and the note circulation from £20,000,000 to

£25,000,000.

It will be observed that the proportion borne by the reserve to the liabilities had

diminished since 1844 from 58 per cent, at the earlier to 42 per cent, at the later

date. Meanwhile the proportion borne by the balances of the London bankers to the

banking reserve of the Bank of England, which was 10 per cent, in 1844, had in-

creased to 62 per cent, in 1872                                                                                                                                            and the minimum rate of interest, which averaged
                                                                                                                                                                        ;

for the years 1844-56 £3 15s. 3(/., increased on the average for 1857-72 to £4 3s

The details of the proportion of the reserve to the liabilities at each change in the

rate of discount for the years 1844-72 were given in Tables ; and these show that it

is the proportion of the reserve of the Bank, the immediate supply of money, which

governs the current rate of interest. This furnishes a remarkable and exact instance

of the working of the law of demand and supply. The amount of money generally

in the country has greatly increased. The amount of banking deposits has alsc

largely increased. The amount of banking reserve has not increased in a like pro-

portion                                and  it is the  amount  of the                                                                                                      supply  immediately available which governs the
                                    ;

               On Pttritt/ and Imj>unti/ in the Use and Abuse of Water.

    By Major-Genoral Millington Synge, B.E., F.S.A., F.R.G.S., F.B.L.l

    Opinion of a Turkish lady on western liabits in the use of water. The contrast

presented by Turkish to western habits of obedience to religious injunctions in re-

spect to cleanliness of person. The systematic corruption of rivers would be impos-

sible consistently with eastern habits in the use of water. Western nations, even

when they use water for personal ablution, reclothe themselves in uncleansed gar-

ments: their houses are externally filthy and often so internally. The use of

water for assuaging thirst <an instinct rather than an act of reason. Analogy between

sobriety and cleanliness. On the indirect eftects on social life of habits of cleanli-

ness, on the wage-taking classes and on the capitalist. On the progress of the

age and the direction of that progi-ess : its dealings with water. On sewer-pollu-
tion. On the difference between the clean and the unclean. On the science of

puiification. The effects on air, water, and earth of contact with man. The ele-

ments of the ancients. Fire. On "waste," the meaning in which the term is em-

ployed. The art of purification. Purification not attained by dilution of the

impure, which is only spreading impurity : it can be attained only by transmuta-

tion, the ceaseless miracle of creation. The contrast between transmutation and

water-carriage of refuse, which sets all the laws of transmutation at defiance : it

multiplies the volume of waste and causes dangerous evils, and destroys the value of

a natural fertilizer. The cost of " main-drainage " of London. The purification of

water. The standard of purity is a restoration to normal condition. The conse-

quences of adopting the standard in remedying water-pollution : its easy applica-
tion. The difficulties caused by sewage-corruption of water increased by the volume

employed. Reclamation or restoration to the normal state should take'place within

the limits of the locality which causes tlie defilement. On the power of intangible

proportions.                                              The easiness of water-pollution                                                                                                                                              but its dire consequences.  The pro-

    Address ly W. H. Baelow, Esq., C.E., F.B.S., President of the Section.

It appears to have become an established custom that the Presidents of the several

Sections of the British Association should say a few words by way of address prior

to  opening the                                           proceedings  of  the  Meeting                                     'and                                                                                                       while  I  feel  that  I  sliould  neglect
                                                                                                                         ;

a duty if I did not comply with this usage, yet I know that I shall have need of all

your indulgence and support while I endeavour to fulfil it.

    I should have felt some difficulty in the selection of a subject were it not that

the genius loci naturally suggests some subject connected with luanufacturos.

   It has been remarked by an eminent writer that there is no single circumstance
which distinguishes our coimtry so remarkably from all others, as the vast extent

to whichwe have carried our contrivances of" tools and machines for forming all

those articles and conveniences of which so large a quantity is consumed by almost

every class of the commimity. And I think it would be difficult to select a' locality

where the results of thought and study, the achievements of genius, and the effects

of strong good sense and long practice in the mechanical arts are more plainly

shown than they are in the place where we are now met and in the surrounding

district.

    It is, however, not alone in tools and machinery that this country has attained a

high position                                             it stands preeminent also  in                                     the                                                                                                        utilization of waste     or incidental
                                                       ;

products, and in tlie production of new materials.

    In the observations which I have to address to you I shall not attempt a general

survey of a subject so vast and so varied as the manufactures of this country, nor

shall I attempt to describe the many new and beautiful inventions and mechanical
appliances which form a distinguishing feature of the age in which we live ; but 1
shall endeavour to draw your attention to one of the new materials, namely

modern steel-- a. material which, though of comparatively recent origin, has already
become an important industry, and whose influence in the future seems destined to

vie in importance with that resulting from the introduction of iron.
   I have used the term " modern steel," because, although the great movement in

simplifying and cheapening the process of producing steel is necessarily associated

with tiie name of Mr. Bessemer, yet we have further important steps taken in a
forward direction as to the production and treatment of steel by Dr. Siemens and

Sir Joseph Whitworth and others, both in this country and abroad.
   It is now seventeen years since Mr. Bessemer read a paper at the Meeting of the

British Association at Cheltenham, which was entitled " On the Manufacture of

Iron and Steel without Fuel."

   Not long afterwards I attended one of the early experiments made by Mr.
Bessemer in London. On that occasion most of those who were favoured with an
invitation to be present saw for the Hrst time that wonderful process in which, by
the simple aid of a blast of atmospheric air and the addition of a little manganese,
n caldron of melted cast iron was, in tlie space of some twenty minutes, converted
mto a material which approached wrought iron in so far as it was malleable, but
differed from it in other ways, the precise character and quality of the material

produced being at that time not fully known.

   I was kindly permitted by Mr. Bessemer to take away with me one of the small
ingots cast on that occasion, and had it made into a bar in the workshops of the

Midland Railway at Derby with the object of testing its strength.
   Just as the bar was finished it broke under the hammer, and an attempt to weld

it together again, treating the metal as iron, failed. This led to a consultation

among the smiths who had assembled round this mysterious bar, and after some

fm'ther trials the metal was unanimously pronounced to be steel.

   Among those who attended that experiment at Mr. Bessemer's works, there

were not wanting some of that class who, though they admitted the genius and
intelligence which devised the process, and expressed their admiration of it as a
scientific curiosity, were nevertheless very incredulous as to its ever becoming

practically useful"; and it was not without much labour and skill in surmounting

the difficidties of the case, indomitable perseverance in overcoming rooted prej udices,
and great courage in undertaking the necessary expenditure, that Mr. Bessemer

succeeded in produciog that most valuable new material now known as "Bessemer

steel."

It is satisfactory to know that Mr. Bessemer has often expressed his firm con-

viction that had it not been for the publicity given to his invention through the

paper which he read before the ISIeehanical Section of the British Association in

1856, and the great moral support aftbrded him by men of science whose attention

was thereby directed to it, he believes that he would not have succeeded in over-

coming the strong opposition with which liis invention was met in other quarters.

About this time, or perhaps a little later, a material was produced called " puddled

steel," and about the same time the metal known as "homogeneous iron."

The movement which had begun in the production of cheap steel was further

assisted and developed by the regenerative furnace of Dr. Siemens, by the intro-

duction of the Siemens-Martin process of making steel, and further and most

important progi-ess is suggested by the recent process introduced by D~r. Siemens in
making steel direct from the ore.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          . . ..

   According to the returns publishfd by the Jury of the International Exhibition

of 1851, the total annual produce of steel in Great Bntain at that time was 50,0CO
tons. At the present time there are more than 500,000 tons made by the Bessemer

process alone, added to which Messrs. Siemens's works at Landore produce 200,000

tons, besides further quantities which are made by his process at Messrs. Vickers,

Messrs. Cammells, the Dowlais, and other works.

i shall not, however, detain you by attemj)thig to trace up the history and

progress of steel, nor attempt to notice the various steps bv which this branch of

Myindustry has been brought to its present important position.  object is to draw

attention to this material as to its use and application for stnictimd and engineering

purposes.

   The steel produced by the Bessemer process was at a very early stage employed

in rails and wheel-tires. In both these applications the object sought was endurance
to resist the effects of wear, and toughness to prevent fracture by blows. There

does not exist at present sufficient information to determine accurately the relative

values of steel and iron when used for these pui-poses. As used for wheel-tires,

steel had to compete with iron of the highest quality, but it is nevertheless intro-
duced on most of our railways. The iron used in rails was not of such high quality,

and the difference in duration shows a very marked advantage in the employment

of steel, the duration of steel rails being variously estimated at from three to six

times that of iron.

   Steel is also extensively used for ships' plates, and by the AVar Department for
lining the interior of the heaviest guns ; while Sir Joseph Whitworth and Messrs.
Krupp make guns entirely of steel, tliough for these purposes the metal is of

different quality and differently treated, in order to withstand the enormous con-

cussions to which it is subjected.

   And, further, we liave steel used in railway-axles, crank-axles for engines, in
boilers, in piston-rods, in carriage-springs, and ibr many other purposes.

But, notwithstanding these various employments of steel, there has been, and

there continues to be, a difficulty in applying it to engineering stmctures in this

country.

The want of knowledge of the physical properties of steel having been the subject

of remark at a discussion at the Instituticm of Civil Engineers in 1808, a Committee
(composed of Mr. Fowler, Mr. Scott Russell, Captain Gallon, Mr. Berkley, and

nij'self) undertook to conduct a series of experiments upon this subject. Our

services were of course rendered gratuitously ; but the expenses of carrying out this

inquiry, and the samples of steel to be tested, Avere liljerally furnished by the firms

of Messrs. Bessemer, Messrs. Jno. Brown & Co., the Barrow llfematite Company,
the Bolton Iron Company, Messrs. Clamniell & Co., Messrs. Lloyds, Fosters & Co.,
the Newarlv Bridge Company, ]\Iessrs. Naylor, A'ickers & Co., Messrs. Turton &
Sons, Messrs. Firth & Sons, and Messrs. Siemens.

   The experiments recorded consist of four series.
   The first were made for the Committee by !Mr. Kirkaldy with his testing-
machine in l^onJon, and were chiefly directed to ascertain the relation which

subsists between the resistances of tension, compression, torsion, and transverse

strain.

In this series of experiments twenty-nine bars, 15 feet long, were used, each

bar being cut into lengths, and turned or planed into suitable forms for tlie
respective tests, so that a portion of each bar was subjected to each of the above-
mentioned tests.

The tensile resistance varied in the different qualities of steel from twenty-eight

to forty-eight tons per inch, and the experiments established conclusively that the
relation subsisting between the several resistances of tension, compression, and

transverse strain is throughout practically the same as in wrought iron ; that is
to say, that a bar of steel whose tensile strength is 50 per cent, above that of
wrought iron will exhibit about the same relative increase of resistance under the

other tests.

   They further showed that the limit of elasticity in steel is, like that of wrought
iron, rather more than half its ultimate resistance. Tlie total elongation under
tensile strain, and the evidences of malleability and toughness, will be referred to

hereafter.

   The second series recorded in the book published b}' the Committee gave the
results of tempering steel in oil and water. They were made by the officers of the
gun-factory at the Royal Ai'seual at ^^'ool\\·ich, and show a remarkable increase
of strength obtained by this process. This property of steel is now fully recognized
and made use of in the steel which forms the lining of tlie largest guns.

   The third series of experiments was made by the Committee upon bars 14 feet
long, li inch in diameter, with the skin upon the metal as it came from the rolls.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                              203

   The object of these experiments was specially directed to ascertain the moduhis
of elastic'ittj. They were made with the testing-machine at H.M. Dockyard at
Woolwdch, which machine was placed at our disposal by the Admiralty. The

bars were obtained, with some exceptions, in sets of six from each maker, three

bars of each set being used in tension and three in compression.
   Bars of iron of like dimensions were also tested in the same way, in order to

obtain the relative eftects in steel and iron. In these experiments sixty-seven steel

bars were tested whose tensile strength varied from thirty-two to fifty-three tons
per inch, and twenty-four iron bars varying- from twenty-two to twenty-nine tons

per inch.

   The amount of the extensions and compressions were ascertained by direct

measurement, verniers being for this purpose attached to the bar itself, 10 feet
apart, so that the readings gave the absolute extensions and compressions of this

length of the bar.

   These experiments, which were very accurately made, showed that the exten-
sion and compression of steel per ton per inch was a little less than wrought iron,
that the extension and compression were very nearly equal to each other, and that

the modulus of elasticity of steel may be taken at 30,000,000, which result agrees

with the conclusions arrived at by American engineers on this subject.
   This property of the metal is "important in two respects. First, because inas-

much as the extension per ton per inch is practically equal to the compression, it

follows that the neutral axis of a structure of steel, strained transversely, will be

in the centre of gravity of its section, and that the proper proportion to give to

the upper and lower flanges of a girder, when made of the same quality of steel
throughout, will be the same as in wrought iron. Secondly, because the modulus
of elasticitv of steel is practically equal to that of wrought iron, and the limit of
elasticity is greater, it follows that in a girder of the same proportions as wrought

iron, and strained with an equal proportion of its idtimate tensile strength, the
deflection will be greater in the steel than in the iron girder, in the ratio of the
strength of the metals ; so that if it is necessary to make a steel girder for a given
span deflect under its load the same amount as an iron girder of the same span, the

steel girder must be made of greater depth.
   The fourth series of experiments were made by the Committee on riveted steel,

and show clearlv that the same rules which apply to the riveting of iron apply
equally to steel'; that is to say, that the total shearing area of the rivets must be

the same, or rather must not be less, than the sectional area of the bar riveted.
   Having thus obtained a knowledge of the behaviour of steel under diflerent

strains, we may trace in what manner its employment would operate on the
weight of metal required for large engineering structures. But before doing so

I would call your attention to the question of the absolute tensile strength.
   Taking Mr. Kirkaldy's experiments in conjunction with those made by the

Committee, there is a great range of strength exhibited, commencing as low

as that of the best iron, and extending to about fifty-three tons per inch.
   This great range of strength is due to the different qualities and make of the

steels tested, and must not be mistaken for irregularity of strength in the manu-
facture ; on the contrary, in the experiments made by the Committee, in which

three bars of each make were broken, the strengths, with the exception of one set,

are as uniform as in the iron bars similarly tested.

   It is also to be observed that in applying steel to engineering structures we may

dismiss from consideration those superior qualities which are of hi>gh price and

made in comparatively small quantities.  myI propose therefore to confine  obser-

vations to the mild steels, such as are made by the " Bessemer," the " Siemens-

Martin," and other processes, having a tensile strength varying from thirty-three

to thirty-six tons per inch, a material which is made in large quantities and at

moderate cost.

   Following the same rule as is adopted for wrought iron (namely, that the maxi-

mum strain on the metal shall not exceed one fourth of the breaking weight), we

may consider steel of this quality capable of bearing at least eight tons pSr inch,

instead of the five tons per inch estimated for like purposes in iron.

  We know from established mechanical laws that the limiting spans of structures

                                                                                                   14*
--20J<
REPORT 1873.

vary directly as the strength of the material employed in their consti'uction -when
the proportion of depth to span and all other circumstances remain the same.

We know also that, taking an ordinary form of open wrought-iron detached girder

(as, for example, -when the depth is one fourteenth of the span), the limiting span
in iron, with a strain of five tons to the inch upon the metal, is about GOO feet
and it follows that a steel girder of like proportions, capable of bearing eight tons
to the inch, would have theoretically a limiting span of 9C0 feet.

   This theoretical limiting span of 960 feet would, however, be reduced by some
practical considerations connected with the minimum thickness of metal employed

in certain parts, and it would, in effect, become about 900 feet for a girder of the

before-mentioned construction and proportions.
   The knowledge of the limiting span of a structure, as has been explained else-

where, enables us to estimate very quickly, and with close approximation to the
truth, the weight of girders required to carry given loads over given spans ; and

although the limiting spans vary with ever}' form of structure, we can obtain an
idea of the effect of introducing steel by the relative weights of steel and iron

required in girders of the kind above mentioned.

    v^ssuming a load, in addition to the weight of the girder, of one ton to the foot,

the relative weights under these conditions would be as follows :
                      TKANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                          205

Now, as regards the question of toughness and malleabilit}', and referring again

to Mr. Kirkaldy's experiments, it appears that in the tests of " Bessemer steel

eighteen samples were tried under tensile strain, the length of the samples being

in round  numbers     50 inches, and  the  diameter 1-382 inch                                                                              and  that  when  these
                                                                                                                                         ;

were subjected to ultimate strain, tlie elongation at the moment of fracture was

in the most brittle example 2J inches, but generalh' varied from 4^ to 9^ inches.
   In the experiments on transverse strain, in wldch the bars were nearly 2 inches

square and only 20 inches between the points of support, all the " Bessemer

steel " samples, except two, bent 6 inches without any crack. Again, in the

experiments made by the Committee on bars 14 feet long and 1^ inch in diameter,

out of twenty bars of the milder quality of steel, sixteen extended more than 8 inches,

and of these ten extended more than 12 inches.

   As another example of the malleability of steel, I may mention that I have

seen a piece of rail, weighing 80 lbs. per yard, and 12 feet in length, held by one

end and twisted at the other, until it made 6f complete revolutions before it
broke. The fracture occurred at one end, leaving about 11 feet of the rail in the

twisted form which had been given to it.

In this twisted state the rtnl was laid on two bearings 3 feet G inches apart,

and subjected to the blow of 1 ton weight falling 30 feet, and it bore one of these

blows without breaking.

I have also used a considerable quantity of steel rails, the test to which they

were subjected being 1 ton falling 20 feet on a 3-feet 6-inch bearing, and out of

tlie whole number tested there was not one which broke with this test. The

effect of the blow was to produce a set of about 2| inches ; and if the rail was then
reversed and struck on the other side, it became nearly straight again. As a rule,

the rails yielded to the third blow ; but I have seen seven blows given without

producing fi-acture.

(Jn the other hand, five of the bars tested by the Committee were of inferior

malleability.

  We have also instances in which steel rails break with the jar produced by

being thrown off the waggons on to the ballast ; and there is no doubt of the fact
that steel is made and sold which is cold-short, and not reliable for use for

engineering purposes. This irregularity appears to arise mainly from the dif-

ference in the chemical constituents of the metal or ores employed, or in the process

pursued by difterent makers.

   Another element of uncertainty appears to be that, in these modern and rapidly
made steels, the precise time allotted to the several stages of the process, the

degree of heat "employed, and a variety of other circumstances have to be carefully

observed, and any inaccuracy in carrying out the required conditions affects the

quality of steel produced.

Nevertheless it is known that in the Bessemer process, if ores or metal of suit-

able chemical qualities are used and the process of manipulation is properly per-

formed, the quality of metal produced is certain and regular in its results.

In the processes of Dr. Siemens there is not the same necessity for purity in the

ore or metal required, the nature of the process being, I believe, such as to

eliminate some of the ingredients which would prevent toughness being obtained,

while tests may be made during the process of manipulation so as to ascertain

that the metal is of the quality sought before it is run off into the ingot-mould.

Where large castings and metal of great solidity are required, as in making large

gims, there is the method pursued by Sir J. Whitworth, whereby the metal is

intensely compressed while in a tluid state.

The pressure employed is 20 tons per incli, and its effect in producing solidifica-

tion is such as to shorten the ingot about 1^ inch for every foot of length.

The treatment by compression is especially important where metal is required in

large masses and of great ductility, because the larger the mass and the greater the

ductility, the larger and more numerous are the air-cells, and the effect of the pressure

is to completely close these cells and render the metal perfectly solid.

   By this process mild steel can be made with a strength of 40 tons to the inch,

having a degree of ductility equal to that of the best iron.

The more highly carbonized qualities, whose strengths range from 48 up to 72
206 REPORT--1873.

tons per inch, show a decrease of ductility somewhat in the same ratio as the

strength increases.

   Without going into the numerous achievements of Sir Joseph Whitworth re-
sulting from the employment of steel, in connexion with the extreme accuracy of
workmanship produced at his works, or doing more than mention the flat-ended
steel shot and shell which pass through iron plates when fired obliquely or pene-
trate ships' sides below the level of the water, I would call attention to those
applications of steel which bear upon its strength and toughness.

   In the first place, there are small arms made entirely of steel, of wonderful range
and accuracy, capable of penetrating Si half-inch planks, which is about three times

the penetrating power of the Enfield rifle.

Secondly, tliere are the large guns, also entirely of steel, throwing projectiles from

250 lbs. to' 310 lbs. in weight, and burning from 40 to 50 lbs. of powder at a charge,

with which a range of nearly 6^ miles is obtained.
   In both these cases the degree of strength and toughness required in the metal is

much greater than is necessary for engineering structures.
   It is unnecessary to occupy more time in multiplying examples of the toughness of

steel. It is well known to manufacturers, and must also be well known to many

others here present, that steel of the strength of 3.3 or 30 tons per inch can be made,

and is made in large quantities, at moderate price, possessing aU the toughness and

malleability required in engineering structures.

 --I Avill proceed, therefore, to the second part of the subject namely, the want of

means of knowing that a given sample of steel is of the quality suited for structural

purposes.

   "With most other metals chemical analysis is in itself a complete and sufficient

test of quality, but in steel it is not so. The toughness of steel may be altered by

sudden cooling; and although the effect of this operation, and generally the effects

of tempering, are gTeater when the quantity of carbon is considerable, yet it acts
more or less in the mild qiualities of steel ; so that we cannot rely entirely on the
aid of the chemist, but must fall back on mechanical tests. And in point of fact,

seeing that the qualities required are mechanical, it is no more than reasonable that

the test should be mechanical ; for this includes not only the test of material but

of workmanship.

 --Now there are two descriptions of mechanical testing, which may be distin-

guished as destructive and non-destructive the one being beyond and the other

within the elastic limit of the material. The destructive test is that usually applied

to a part of an article manufactured, as, for example, a piece cut off a boiler-plate
and tested by absolute rupture, or by bending or otherwise, whereby the strength
and quality of the material in the plate is known.

   The non-destructive test is that usually applied to the finished work, as in the
test of a boiler by hydraulic pressure, or the testing of a gim by the proof-charge.
The strain in this case is made greater than that which will arise in the daily use
of the article, but is not so gi-eatly in excess as to be beyond the elastic limit of the

material.

   As regards engineering structures, this second test is easy of application ; but it

affords no sufficient criterion that tlie metal possesses that degree of toughness

necessary to resist the action of sudden strains.

   It may be said that engineers may ascertain for themselves, by inspection and test-

ing at the works, that they are being supplied with the material that they require

but assuming that the tests and mode of testing were in all respects satisfactory to
them, and that the metal supplied was of the right quality, we have still to comply
with the conditions prescribed by the Act for the Regulation of Railways, and we

must satisfy the Government Inspector.

It is not to be supposed that he can attend  all  the required   tests at  the works
                                                                                                                     ;

Howand the questiou remains,  is the Inspecting Officer of the Board of Trade to

be enabled to distinguish the quality of metal in a tinisiied bridge, when he is called

upon to give a certificate that it is safe for public traffic ?

If we could adduce clear and distinct evidence that the metal used for a bridge

was of a qualitv which would bear 8 tons to the inch with as much safety aa

common iron can bear 5 tons, there can be no reasonable doubt that the Board of
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  207

Trade would make suitable provision in its regulations for the employment of such

material.

   The difficulty lies in the want of something whereby the quality of the metal

may be known and relied upon with confidence by others besides those who made

the article.

   In gold and silver this is accomplished by the stamp put upon them, in guns and

small arms we have the proof-mark, but iu iron and steel we liave nothing whereby

the one quality of metal can be distinguished from another ; and mitil some suffi-

cient means be devised for this purpose, it is difficult to see how we are to escape

--from the position in which we are now placed namely, that while we possess a

material by which we can increase considerably the spans and diminish the weight
and cost of engineering works, we are restricted to malce designs and construct our
works by a rule made for wi'ought iron, and adapted to the lowest quality of that

material.

   As the rule made by the Board of Trade in respect of ^\TOught-iron railway struc-
tures may not be generally known, I here give it :

    " In a wrought-iron bridge, the greatest load which can be brought upon it, added
" to the weight of the superstructure, should not produce a greater strain on any
" ptart of the material than five tons per inch."

    It will be observed that this o tons per inch is the governing element, irrespec-

tive entirely of the quality of metal used ; and it is obvious that a rule so framed
must act as a discouragement to any endeavour to improve the quality of metal,
while it tends to induce the employment of the cheapest and most inferior descrip-
tions which can be made under the name of wrouglit iron.

    In endeavouring to seek an amendment of the rules, which will permit of the
employment of steel or other metal of higher strength than 5 tons to the inch, I
feel bound to say that I do not consider that the Board of Trade is alone responsi-
ble for the position in which the question now stands ; and, as regards the Govern-
ment Inspecting Officers, I can only say that in the numerous transactions I have
had with them, and although dift'erences of opinion have occasionally arisen, yet,
considering the responsibility which rests upon them, I have found them anxious

to aftbrd all reasonable facilities so far as their instructions permitted.

    The first step to be taken is to put our testing on a systematic and satisfactory basis.
    The second is to establish some means whereby metal which has been tested
can have its quality indicated upon it iu such manner that it can be practically

relied upon.

    The experiments before referred to establish, sufficiently for all practical pur-
poses, that the relation or proportion between the resistances to tension, compres-
sion, torsion, and transverse strain is about the same iu steel as in wrought iron.

    The testing required is therefore reduced to that necessary for ascertaining two
 properties only, namely the strength and the toughness or ductility.

    The strength may be readily ascertained, and no difficulty arises on that head.
    The whole question turns upon the test for ductilitj', or the resistance to fracture

by blows or sudden strain ; and it must be admitted that the tests employed for
 this purpose are not framed on any regular or satisfactory basis.

    I may mention as an example the test of rails by a falling weight.
    In the first place, as usually applied, it is made a destructive test, the weight and

 fall being such as to bend and render the rail unfit for use, however good its quality

may be.

     Secondly, being a destructive test, it is applied only to 1 or 2 per cent, of tha

 quantity ; and if this amount bear the test, the remainder are assumed to be like

 them. I have recently had occasion to know, in a case which came before me re-
 specting iron rails, that this assumption may be entirely fallacious.

    Again, we find 10 to 18 cwt. fiiUing 5 feet used for iron rails, while 1 ton falling

 20 feet and sometimes 30 feet is specified for steel, and yet both descriptions

 of rail are called upon to perform the same work when laid down in the road.

     I believe the falling weight, or, in other words, the test by impact, to be a good
 and searching test for detecting brittleness ; and it has the advantage of being
 cheap, quick, and easy of application, but it is questionable if it is applied iu the

 best manner.
--208 KEPOKT 1873.

   Except in cases of accident, when an engine or train leaves the line, rails of the
weight now used in permanent way are never known to be hent bj' the passnge of

trains, but brittle rails will break.

   The weight on the driving-wheel of a large engine is about 8 tons ; the amount
of vertical fall in passing along the line is necessarily very small ; and we know by

experience that this large weight with this small fall is suiEcient to break inferior

rails, while it leaves the good ones unbent and uninj ured.

   What we require of the test by impact is that it should be so arranged as to do

what  the  engines do,  detect  the  brittle  rails  without  destroying  the  good  ones
                                                                                                            ;

whereas, as now applied, it destroys the 1 or 2 per cent, of the rails submitted to

the test, however good they may be, while it gives no information whatever

regarding the remaining 98 or 99 per cent, of the quantity.

Another test for toughness or ductility which is very useful is the extension of

the metal beyond the limit of elasticity.

In testing his fluid-compressed steel. Sir Joseph Whitworth employs this test

upon a piece of the mefnl inches in length. For a length of 2 inches at each

end a screw is cut for the purpose of enabling the hydraulic apparatus to bring the

strain to bear on the sample. The remaining 2 inches between the screwed portions
is accurately turned down until the sectional area is exactly ^ an inch.

   The sample is now subjected to strain, and the recorded extension occasioned by

the strain at the moment of rupture is treated as percentage or proportion of the

2 inches between the screws, and is described as the percentufie of ductility.

Eut it is obvious the measure of ductility so obtained has reference to the par-

ticular length and dimensions of the specimen, and would be altogether varied if a

long bar were tested instead of a short one.

 --There is, however, another evidence of ductility which, within certain limits, is

independent of length that is, the diminution of sectional area which takes place

at the point of rupture ; and the ratio Avhich the original sectional area of the bar

bears to the sectional area of the fractured end appears to aflbrd a more definite

measure of ductility.

Thus in the experiments of Mr. Kirkaldy, previously referred to, it appears that

in bars 50 inches long and 1'382 inch diameter, the sectional area of the fractured

end was in some cases less than five tenths of the original section.

   In the bars broken by the Committee, which were 14 feet long and 1| inch in
diameter, it was in the best samples under six tenths, while the best qualities of

wrought iron similarly treated showed a ratio of about five tenths.

It is to be observed that such a degree of ductility as is presented by these

samples is not needed in engineering structures, the wrought iron frequently used,

and I may say generally used, for these purposes being of much less ductility.

   Without, however, attempting to say what description of test may be found the
best for ascertaining the property of ductility, it may be observed that what is

required for this test is a definite basis to act upon, and that the samples should be

so made as to render the test cheap, expeditious, and easy of application.
   The next requirement is that when a piece of metal has been tested, and its

qualities of strength and toughness ascertained, there should be some means of

denoting its quality in an authentic manner".

   To a certain extent this is already done in iron by the mark of the maker ; but
something more than this is necessary to fulfil the required conditions in steel.

   W^hat is termed steel, is iron with a small proportion of carbon in it. These two
ingredients are necessai-y to constitute steel ; and there may or may not be present

in very small quantities graphite, silicon, manganese, sulphur, and phosphorus.

In connexion with the experiments made by the Committee, 14 of the samples

were tested by Mr. E. Richards, of the Barrow Steel Works, 5 of which were kindly

repeated by Dr. Odling.

Although there are some discrepancies in the results which we cannot accoimt

for, yet some of the characteristics are brought out clearly.

It appears that manganese maj' be present to the extent of four tenths per cent,

without injur}' either to the strength or ductility, but sulphur and phosphorus,

except in extremely small quantities, are fatal to ductility.
   in the samples tried by the Committee and Mr. Kirkaldy, the quantity of carbon
              TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                        209

varied  from a per cent, to nearly 1  per  cent.                          yet with  this small variation                       in  the
                                                                       ;

carbon the strength ranged from 33 tons to  nearly .53 tons                         per inch                                   and the duc-
                                                                                                                            ;

tilit}^ represented by the ratio wliicli the fractured area bore to tlie orio-inal section

of the bar, varied from five tenths in the tough qualities, until in the harder

samples there was no diminution perceptible.

   All these materials are called steel, and have the same external appearance ; but
possessing, as they do, such a range of strength and such a variation in ductility,

it becomes absolutely essential that there should be some classification or means
of knowing the respective qualities among them.

   The want of such classification casts an air of uncertainty over the whole ques-
tion of steel, and impedes its application. To this want of knowledge is to be
ascribed the circumstance that many professional men regard the material as

altogether unreliable ; while large consumers of steel, in consequence of the un-

certainty of the quality they buy in the market, seek to establish works on their
own premises and make their own steel.

   This step has already been taken by one of the large railway' companies, and is,

as I am informed, contemplated by one of the principal constructive departments

of the Government.

  My attention has been recently and forcibly directed to the importance of steel

through having been called upon, in conjunction with Mr. Bidder, Sir John
Hawkshaw, Mr. Harrison, and Dr. Pole, to report upon the magnificent work
designed by Mr. Bouch for crossing the Firth of Forth. This great work consists

of a stiffened suspension bridge in two spans, each of 16G0 feet between the

supports.

To construct this work in iron, with a working strain of 5 tons to the inch, would

involve such weights of material and magnitude of strain as to render it virtually

inj practicable ; but in tough steel, capable of bearing 8 tons per inch, it is praticable
to accomplish it and even larger spans.

   Mr. Bouch has designed the chains of this bridge to be made of steel ; and in
addition to the honour which must attach to his name as the originator of this
great and important work, he is further entitled to the merit of being the first
engineer to break through the restrictions which confine om- engineering structures
to wrought iron, and to brave the difficulties which surround the employment of
steel for railway works in this country.

   I ought, I know, to apologize for detaining you so long on this one question of
steel, but I consider that the difficulties under which it is placed are affecting

interests of considerable importance.

Not only is a large and useful field for the employment of steel practically

closed, but the progress of improvement in engineering structures is impeded

both in this countryand in other parts of the world where English em'^ineers

are engaged.

For in consequence of the impediments to its en:ployment in England, very few

English engineers turn their attention to the use of steel. They are accustomed
to make their designs for iron, and when engaged in works abroad where the

Board of Trade rules do not apply, they continue for the most part to send out the

old-fashioned ponderous girders of common iron, in cases where the freio-ht and
difficulties of carnage make it extremely desirable that structures of less weight and

more easy of transport should be employed.

   In conclusion, and while thanking you for the patience with which you have

heard me on this subject, I would observe that we possess in steel a material which

has been proved, by the numerous uses to which it is applied, to be of great

capability and value; we know that it is used for structural pm'poses in other

mcountries, as, for example, in the Illinois and St. Louis Bridge America, a

bridge of three arches, each 500 feet span ; yet in this country,where "modern steel"

has originated and has been brought to its present state of perfection, we are
obstructed by some deficiency in our own arrangements, and by the absence

of suitable regulations by the Board of Trade, fi'om making use of it in engineering'

works.

And I have considered it right to draw your attention to the position in which

this question stands, well knowing that I eould not address any body of gentlemen

       On the Lisbon Steam Tramways, 1873. By W. H. Barlow, Jmi.

   This paper was a description of the Lisbon steam tramways. The peculiarity of
their construction is, that the permanent way consists of only one central rail, on
which double-flange bogie-wheels, supporting the weight of the train, run. On
each side of this central rail are longitudinal timbers, inches broad, on which run
the side wheels of the engine and carriages, said side wheels having no flanges.
The driving-wheels of the engine are 14 inches broad, giving great adhesion in

running on the timbers.
   This construction possesses great facilities for ascending steep gTadients and going

round sharp curves. The ruling gradient was 1 in 20 ; the curves principally in use

are from f to 2 chains radius.

   The author of the paper had travelled on the tramway at Lisbon, constructed as
above, at a pace of twelve miles an hour, and in some places had travelled twenty
to thirty miles an hour, and could therefore testify to its efficiency, while its
economy spoke for itself.

   The can-iages are further balanced on the central bogie-wheels, so that they run
like a bicycle ; when running fast the side wheels are scarcely used.

   The author remarked on the want of a construction of this nature for localities
where the traffic would not justify the outla}"^ necessary for constructing an ordinary
railway ; and, further, that it was a good construction to lay down, pro tern., to
develop the resources of a district, and gradually to be superseded by a regular
railway. In France and in Portugal it is used as a tramway and laid along the
public roads, and has been found to answer admirably.

On Huyyett's Siistem of Manufacturing Horse-nails.

           By F.J. Bramwell, C.E., F.R.S.

   The author, in the commencement of his paper, remarks upon the fact that while
for many years past ordinary nails have been made by machinery, and in more
recent times even the screws which are used by cai-penters (commonly called "wood
screws") have been so made, the horse-nail has remained in the domain of handi-
craft, although its simple form and appearance would lead to the belief that it was

at least as fit a subject to be the product of mechanical skill as is the carpenter's
nail, and far more fit a subject than the carpenter's screw, requiring, as this latter

does, a number of delicate and complicated processes, all of which processes, how-
ever, are now most successfully performed by a succession of automatic machines.

   The author then shows that the horse-nail, notwithstanding its apparently simple
character, has a speciality in its use which demands in it special qualities and

involves a special manufacture.

   The speciality in its use is that, unlike the carpenter's nail and screw, which are
employed to penetrate mere inert and dead matter, the horse-nail has to be driven

* Published in cxfcnso in the ' Engineer ' for Oct. o 1873.  f Ibid.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  211

into something alive ; further, that while the nail must be so tough that it can be
with certainty bent over at the point to "clinch " it when in the hoof, it must still
be sufficiently stiff to penetrate the horny substance of that hoof, and to penetrate
without risk of wandering from the true direction, as were it to do so it would be

very likely to pass into the interior of the hoof and to lame the horse ; and, as a

final peculiarity, that the horse-nail when driven in is not there once and for all,
but in the course of a few weeks it has to be withdrawn, and that there must be

no risk of breakage in this withdrawal.

   The author then states that about seven years since the Messrs. Huggett set
themselves to devise means of making horse-nails by machinery, and that, having

secured tlie support of Mr. Moser, a factory was provided and machines were made.

These, as machines, answered well ; but the nails produced, though fair to the
eye, were unsound : after endeavouring for a long time to remedy the defect, the
attempt was abandoned, so far as that particular class of machine was concerned,
and the whole of them were pulled up and thrown into the scrap-heap. The

Messrs. Iluggett then again applied themselves to their task and invented
another machine, which turned out nails, not only perfect in appearance, but also
perfect in fact. Thereupon a large factory was tilled with machinery ; Init again
failure and loss were to result, not from the imperfection of the nail, but from the
inability of the machine to withstand tlie wear and tear incident to the particular

nature of its action. Once more the scrap-heap was the destination of property
which had cost thousands of poimds.

   For a third time the Messrs. Huggett set themselves to invent a mode of
making horse-nails by machinery, which they trusted would not only produce a
thoroughly good nail, but would endure the test of daily use.

   About three years since Mr. Moser consulted the author and asked him to advise
as to whether or not a third adventure of capital should be made.

    Having thoroughly investigated the subject, including in this investigation an
inquiry into the causes of the two former failures, the author came to the conclusion
and advised that a trial (a commercial one, but on a small scale, to the extent of
about £5000 of outlay) should be given to this third invention of the Messrs.
Huggett. The advice was followed, and the result has been highly satisfactory,
the working of the process having proved a complete success.

   The author then proceeds to describe the mode of manufacture now followed in

carrying out this third invention.

    The material used is the Swedish charcoal iron nail-rod, which is heated in a
Siemens Regenerative Gas-furnace, a double furnace having two working doors
 (attended by two men) at each end.

    Six pieces of the nail-rod, in leng-ths of about 2 feet 6 inches, are charged into

the furnace at each working door. Thirty seconds suffice to raise them to a high

 welding-heat.

   The workman who has charged a parcel of rods then (by means of a pair of
tongs) takes out the pieces one by one and jerks them endways down an inclined
shoot, by which they are conducted to a pair of rolls, which seize them in suc-
cession as they are presented and roll them through. The author then points out

 that these rolls, and the operations they perform upon the iron, are of the very
 highest importance in the manufacture, that, in fact, they lie at the root of it.

    The author then describes that the rolls are pattern-rolls, and are so constructed
that when working together they leave a channel or groove for the passage of the
nail-rod, which passage, while parallel and of uniform size, so far as regards its
sideway dimensions, varies in its height as the revolution of the rolls brings round

the different parts of their patterned surfaces. By the action of the patterned

surfaces, the rod which had entered the rolls a piece of mere parallel iron about
2 feet 6 inches long, leaves them as a rod of nail-blanks 7 feet in length, and made
up of numerous alternate prominences and depressions, occurring at distances apart
corresponding to the length of two nails, each prominence being intended for two
heads and each depression for two shanks.

    Obviously a change of shape so violent must be done at a high heat ; and,
looking at the small section of the iron, the only way to retain the heat during
the whole rolling is to run the rolls at a great velocity, so that there shall
212 REPORT--1873.

not be time for the iron to cool. With this view the rolls are driven at as
many as 5-50 revolutions per minute, giving (the rolls being about 7 inches in

diameter) a surface speed of about 1000 feet.

   The author then mentions how consecutive work is kept up by the two men

taking care to alternate their charges of rods into the furnace, so that while those

first put in are being rolled a second lot are heating. The operations of feeding
and of rolling each take thirty seconds.

   The author then enters into certain mechanical details as to how the rolls are
arranged to support the endway strain put upon them by the attempt of the plastic

iron in the grooves to spread sideways under the vertical pressure.

   The author then points out that it is an essential condition of obtaining good
work from pattern-i'olls that they should not be overheated, that they should not
be injured by the nearly fluid oxide adhering to the heated iron, and that the

objects produced should be able to leave the rolls with facility. He then describes
how the Messrs. Iluggett attained all these desiderata by causing a stream of coal-

tar to impinge upon the verj' channel or working chamber of the rolls, which
stream abstracts the heat, affords a lubricant, and at the same time supplies a film
(a mere microscopic one) of carbon between the heated iron and the surface of

the rolls.

   The author next remarks upon the necessitv of keeping such implements as

pattern-rolls in perfect repair, and states that with this object it has oeen wisely
determined never to allow the rolls to run for more than " one shift " without
adj ustment ; this being done daily, and being perft)rmed by the aid of appro-
priate tools, is a simple and expeditious operation, not more than -j^ of an inch
in thickness having to be removed.

   The author then proceeds to describe that the heated rod of noil-blanks, after
they are shot out of the rolls into tlie receiving-traj^, are pulled straight, and that
when cold they are presented, edgeways up, to the action of a pair of plain surface-
rollers, which press on the top of the prominences, and thus diminish their height
and proportionately' increase their breadth, by whioh means the metal in the
prominences is made to project in the direction of the width of the shank of the
nail, as well as in tlie previous direction, that of its depth, and is thus disposed in
the most suitable manner to be subsequenth^ formed into the heads.

   The author then reverts to the employment in this uiainifacture of the Siemens
Regenerative Gas-furnace, and points out how essential it is that for roUiug
(such as that which has been described) there should be none of that variation of
size which must occur by waste in an ordinary furnace ; and he shows how, hj the
ability which the Siemens furnace affords of giving not only a non-oxidizing but
even a reducing flame, the risk of waste is reduced to a minimum ; and states, so

successful has the application of this apparatus been to this particular manufacture,
that the total of furnace and rolling-mill waste is only .3 per cent., which, looking
at the small size of the iron heated, and the large proportion the surface bears
therefore to the weight, is an almost incredibly favourable result.

   The author then, proceeding with the description of the manufacture, states that
the flattened rods of nail-blanks are next taken to the cutting-machine, which has
three pairs of cutters, so that at each stroke it severs the rod through the pro-
minences, so as to cut out of each the future heads of two nails, and severs it
through the thin parts to produce the shanks of those nails, and the cut being on
a level forms at the same time the rudimentary point, while the third pair of
cutters shears off a small portion from the point, and thus regulates the nail to the

exact length.

   The author then describes the peculiar contrivances by which perfect squareness

of cut is obtained in these particular machines.

   The separated nail-blanks, it is stated, are then examined, and any that may be

imperfect are thrown out. After this the perfect blanks are subjected to friction
one against another in a slowly revolving cylinder called a " Rumbler," after which
they are annealed, certain precautions rendered necessary bj' tlie character of the
material and the nature of the article to be produced being taken.

   The author tlien dcFcribes the next process, the one that gives the true shape to
the head. This, it is stated, is done in a machine having a vertically reciprocating

plunger, carrying the heading-tool, which operates upon the upper end of the blank,

spreading it out so as to fill a cavity of the shape of the head. Such a cavity is

formed ia each one of a pair of dies, twelve in number, inserted about the periphery

of a strong bolster-wheel carried on a horizontal axis. The blanks to be headed

are fed by the atteudaut into the dies, and by the intermittent motion of the wheel

are brought at the right time under the action of the heading-tool. There is a

contrivance b}' which the halves of the disks are grasped firmly together while the

pressure is being put on the head ; but this grasp is talcen off after the head is

formed, so as to allow the headed blank to be readily discharged.

  An efficient but simple mode of repairing the heading-dies is then pointed out.

After tlie heading the blanks are again annealed, and they are then taken to the

final machine, the shaping-machine.

   The author describes that this machine is almost identical in its construction
with that of the " Header," the difference being that the heading-tool in the vertical

punch is replaced by one of a proper form to give the fiat-way shape, while a pair

of side presses are added which produce the side-way finish.

After this operation the nails are submitted to a final examination, then to two

consecutive " rumblings," the first one being with a gritty substance to produce

extra attrition ; and after these two " rumblings" the nails are taken to a revolving

cylinder, like a coffee-roaster, in which they are heated to such a temperature as

to produce a deep blue colour. They are then ready for the market.

The author concludes his paper by stating that the works, which are situated at

Nine Elms, near London, are provided with machinery which is now tua-ning out

five tons of nails per week, that he understands that the machinery is speedily

about to be very much added to, to increase the production                                                                                                                                                                                                                              and he then expresses
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

his opinion that the result of the invention will be not only, as he trusts, a profit

to the spirited inventors and to the capitalist (Mr. Moser), but also a benefit to

the public, and a benefit even to the persons now employed in the hand manu-

facture of horse-nails, which, being a trade that demands scarcely any plant, is

carried on in the cottages of the workpeople, is very badly remunerated, is the

subject of very great disturbances, in the way of trade disputes, and is altogether

in a most unsatisfactory condition, so far as regards both the remuneration and

comfort of the workpeople.

             On the "Duti/" of Arrastres hi reducing Gold Ore in Italy.
                      By C. Le Neve Fostek, B.A., D.Sc., F.G.8.

   After defining " duty " as the percentage of the total gold contents extracted by
the machines, the author proceeded to give the results of experiments carried on
by him for three years (18UU-72) at the Piedimulera Reduction Works, situated at
the foot of the Val Anzasca, and belonging to the Pestarena Gold-Mining Company.
The machines used for reducing the ore are improved arrastres, on a plan invented
by Messrs. T. and J. Roberts and H. Iloskings.

   The ore for amalgamation, containing from 9 to 13 dwts. per ton, was very care-
fully sampled and assayed before it went to the arrastres. The average result for

the first year was, that the arrastres extracted 7?>'S per cent, of the gold in the ore,

in the second year 78-o per cent., and in the third year 82 per cent. The author
called attention to the ftvct that the average duty of the six winter months, when
the average temperature of the water supplied to the mills was 39'' F., was always
higher than the average duty of the six summer mouths, when the average tempe-

rature of the water supplied "to the mills was 52° F. He considered that the fall in
duty for the summer months was due to the water being charged with mud from

the glaciers, whereas in winter the water was quite clear. The fact, however, was
instanced to show that high duties are quite compatible with cold water.

On Stone-dressing in Bradford. By ARcniBALD Neii.l.

There is little machinery at work in the stone trade of the district ; for, although

stone-moulding and -dressing machines have been at work on Eath, Portland, and

other soft stones of the southern counties, they are not adapted to work the hard

stone of this district, the great grinding-power of the stone on the tools being a
Weconsiderable difhculty.
                           have the ordinary steam stone-saws, that are very

useful, enabling the builder to cut the stone in such a manner as always to secure
that when set in the building it shall be on its natural bed. At the same time

it is a great economizer of material, saving fully 10 per cent. Coulter and Harpin's
and the ordinary rubbing-tables are in use, and answer well for flags, landings, and

common work. Still we want machines that will perform the more expensive
portions of masons' work, such as moulding, sinking, and circular work. The

--author exhibited sketches of four machines which he had constructed two for

working stone, and two for wood. Though simple, they are yet capable of doing

a considerable amount of work. In No. 1 the stone is placed on a travelling table,
and carried against the cutters held on a revolving wheel. The stone is then cut

to a true face. The grind on the tool is considerable, but the expense in steel and
sharpening is not so much as in the ordinary masons' chisel. The work is done

at one third the cost of hand labour. No. 2 machine is for rubbing stone to a true

and smooth face. The stone is roughly punched to a shape and fixed on a table.
This table is moved before the face of a revolving plate, while weights draw the
stone up against the face of the plate. Sand and water are put on, and the work
is done at about one third the cost of hand labour. This machine is simple and
cheap, and requires little power to drive it. The author concluded by exhibiting

drawings of two machines for working wood.

On the Sand-Blast Process for Cutting and Ornamenting Stone, Glass, and

              other Hard Substances. By W. E. Newton, C.E.

   In this process a stream of sand is introduced into a rapid jet of steam or air so
as to acquire a liigli velocitj^, and is then directed upon any hard or brittle sub^
stance so as to cut or wear awa^^ its surface.

   For work, such as cutting or ornamenting- stone, where a considerable quantity

of material is to be removed, a steam-jet of from 60 to 120 lbs. pressure has o-ene-

rally been used as the propelling- agent. The sand is introduced by a centraftube
of about J-iuch bore, and the steam issues from an annular passage surrounding
the sand-tube. The impetus of the steam then drives the sand through a chilled iron
tube i-iuch bore and about 6 inches long, imparting Aelocity to it in the passage,
and the sand hnally strikes upon the stone, which is held' about 1 inch distant
when a deep narrow cut is desired, but may be 10 or 15 inches distant when a

broad surface is to be operated on.

   This chilled iron tube is the only part of the apparatus which is worn away by
the cutting-action of the sand ; it is so arranged as to be easily replaced, and lasts

about ten hours.

To produce ornaments or inscriptions on stone, either in relief or intaglio, a

stencil or template of iron or caoutchouc is held on or cemented to the stone, and

the sand-jet is moved with an even and steady motion over the whole surface, so

that all the exposed parts may be operated upon and cut to the same depth.

The skill and time of the artist may be devoted exclusively to making the stencil

or template                                                         this  being  prepared, the  most  elaborate and                                                                                                                                                                          intricate designs can be
                                                                 ;

to make 100 cuts ^\ inch deep in marble, and will then be worn down to about -jV

inch thickness. Malleable iron templates last about four times as long as cast iron.

                                                                    to

scarcely perceptible wear while 50 cuts were made in marble, each cut being about

i inch deep, or about 12^ inches in all, or 200 times the thickness of the caoutchouc.

With a supply of steam equal to about 1^ horse-power, at a pressure of about

100 lbs., the catting effect per minute was about 1^ cubic inch of granite, or 4 cubic

inches of marble, or 10 cubic inches of rather soft sandstone. To cut a face or level

surface on a rough stone, the sand-jet is made to cut a groove about 1 inch deep

along the whole leng-th of the stone ; the overhanging edge is then broken off with

the hammer, and the jet is advanced an inch and a new groove is cut, and its

overhanging edge is broken off, and so on.

 ^ To cut a deep channel, as in quarrying, two jets set at divergent angles are used.
These jets make parallel grooves about 3 inches apart, leaving between them a
narrow fin or tongue of stone, which is broken off by a tool ; the jets are then
advanced and new grooves cut. The sides of the channel are parallel, and it is
made -wide enough to permit the whole jet-pipe to enter, so that it may be cut to

any desired depth, say 8 or 10 feet.

   If we apply the sand-blast to a cake of resin on which a picture has been pro-

duced by photography in gelatin, or drawn by hand in oil or gum, the bare parts

of the surface may be cut away to any desired depth. The lines left in relief will

be well supported, their base being broader than their top, there being no under
cutting, as is apt to occur in etching on metal with acid.

  An electrotype from this matrix can be printed from in an ordinary press as from

a stereotype plate.

   The sand-blast has been applied to cutting ornaments in wood, cleaning metals
from sand, scale, &c., cleaning the fronts of buildings, graining or frosting metals,
cutting and dressing mill-stones, and a variety of other purposes.

On the Economical Generation of Steam, By Robert Sutcltffe.

The steam-boiler as at present constructed seems to be only partially adapted

for the economical generation of steam, and this because it is expected to fulfil

somewhat dissimilar conditions. It is required as a generator, as a reservoir, and

receptacle, and it must resist a pressure always in excess of that which it is intended

to put upon the steam-engine. As a reservoir for steam it must have cubic capacity,

which of itself diminishes its power of resisting pressure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               and to enable it to resist
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

pressure the plates must be made stronger, and the additional thickness of metal

which is thus interposed between the fire and the water diminishes the efficiency

of the boiler as a generator of steam.

As the pressure is increased, the cubic capacity of the boiler must be reduced,

thus restricting the reservoir room ; whilst if the reservoir space be enlai-ged, its

capability of resisting pressure is diminished                                                                                                                                                                                                      it is thus found that incompatibilities
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

are involved, and that in trying to accomplish one object, another of primary im-

portance must be sacrificed.

   It would therefore seem that the boiler ought to be treated as a compound
machine, and be constructed with adjuncts, so that each part may perform its appro-
priate functions, and separately contribute to the efficiency of the boiler in its three-

fold capacity as a generator, as a reservoii-, and as a vessel capable of containing
steam at a great pressure.

Where intermittent and irregular motion only is required, large steam spaces

may not be of  much importance                                                                                    but in spinning-mills, where                                                                                                                                                                           extreme and  unin-

termitting steadiness of motion is required, considerable steam space is indis-

pensable, for the reason that a reservoir of force is as necessary in the boiler as a
reservoir of motion is necessary in the fly-wheel of the steam-engine.

   The boiler which combines the maximum of advantages with the minimum of

drawbacks for mill purposes seems to be the ordinary double-flued Lancashire
boiler, strongly made and double-riveted and about seven feet in diameter, and

vyith the flues well filled with Galloway tubes, upon which the heat impinges at
right angles, and being intercepted is at once communicated to the water inside

the boiler.

This boiler is in itself a good generator                                                                                                                                                                             it aff"ords the requisite reservoir room for

cannot intercept and utilize all the heat which is produced, no inconsiderable

Eortion of which escapes into the waste-flue, and thence to the chimney. This

  eat should be intercepted and utilized by a series of pipes placed in the flue, so

that the minimutu quantity may find its way to the chimney. Wrought-iron

metal being thin, the waste heat is at once communicated to the feed-water inside

the pipes                                       and, further, wrought-iron pipes do                                       not incur    much liability to fracture

on account of alternating temperature, or from any uncertain or \iolent action of

the pumps, or misadventure from other causes.

    In thus endeavouring to utilize fuel to the utmost, other difficulties present

themselves. The chimney-draft is produced by hot air ; and if this heat is arrested,
chilled, and absorbed by coming into, contact with obstacles in the shape of pipes,

the surfaces of which are kept comparatively cold by the feed-water inside, the

chimney-draft is correspondingly diminished and injured; and if the heat were

altogether absorbed, there would be no chimney-draft at all ; therefore, in many

cases, the injury to the di-aft is the direct measure of the utility of the appliances

for the absorption of the waste heat. In this contingency it is well to have recourse

to the fan-blast to improve the draft, and thus to supply the requisite quantity of

oxygen by mechanical means.

I have learnt from experience that machine firing with the aid of the fan-blast is

the most effective. The fuel is supplied continuously, ignition is more regular and

intense, and the chill and consequent destruction of heat caused by frequently

opening the furnace-doors is avoided. Steam is raised with a greater certainty

and at less cost both in fuel and wages by this mode of. firing. There is also an

economy in grate-bars, and greater facility in preventing and consuming smoke.

To assist the fireman in preventing smoke, it is well to have a reflector of plate

glass fixed in some convenient place outside the building, so that he may see at any

moment and at a glance how the chimney top is behaving. No eificient work can

be performed without good tools, and these in return require the care and watchful

intelligence of the workman.

   We cannot economize fuel to the utmost without proportionately diminishing the

power of the boiler as a generator of steam. If the boiler be furiously fired without

any regard to economy in fuel, all other things being equal, more steam will be

raised, thougli at a greater cost, than if the firing were done carefully. If the heat

be extracted to the utmost possible extent, the boiler of necessity does less work,

and the steam raised is less in quantity ; and a similar fact appears in the economical

utilization of steam in the steam-engine. In the boiler, as in the engine, conflicting

conditions arise, that whilst we seek to satisfy the one, we of necessitj' sacrifice the

other. In the production of heat it may also be borne in mind that the engine is a

valuable adjunct to the boiler, to which it may be made to restore a portion of its

waste heat, which has already done its work as a motive power.

       The Economical Utilization of Steam. Bij Robert Sutcliffe.

The primary object which the steam-engine has to secure in spinning- and

weaving-mills'is extreme regularity and steadiness of motion ; compared with this

economy in fuel, important though it be, is a subordinate consideration. Thus,

whilst theory tells us to use one engine only with enlarged cylinder area, a pair of

engines working at right angles give a steadiness of motion and equability of

pressure unattainable in the other case ; hence the pair is adopted, and the theo-

retical advantages of a single engine are discarded. When steam is used at a high

degree of expansion with a single engine, the irregularity of motion is in many
cases painfully apparent. AVeight and velocity in the fly-wheel may diminish
the defect, but cannot entirely neutralize it; but with a pair of engines we can
work with high expansion combined with great steadiness of motion. Where

steadiness of motion is not of primary importance, economy in fuel may be the

first consideration. In this case we may work with a single engine with steam

ut upon the piston at high pressure, cut olF early in the stroke and wrought to a

Iigh degree of expansionr 13ut here our finest calculations are rudely interrupted

ill practice. The engine at a certain pressure and a certain cut-olT and at a certain
velocity may be calculated to do its work at the greatest economy in steam ; but
if the exigencies of trade require more work to be got out of the engine, these con-
ditions are at once disturbed, and the theoretical mechanic tells me that I am not
upon the best footing. The precaution must also be taken that the engine must
in all cases be above its work ; but whether above or below its work a theoretical

drawback is involved : if underweighted to begin with, the load, as a rvde, is
bit by bit increased until it is overweighted ; and this, not that the manufac-

turer is ignorant, but that he has sacrificed theoretical advantages to the exigencies

of his trade.

Where steadiness of motion is required, it seems preferable to use a pair instead

of a single engine ; and it is advantageous al^o to use the steam expansively up to
a certain point, although by so doing the mechanical result obtainable from the

engine is proportionately diminished. Where high pressures are used it is better
to have a compound engine, using the steam throughout the double stroke by
means of a smaller cylinder exhausting into a larger one. To arrange differently

involves a gi-eat waste of metal in the engine, and very heavy pressure upon the
bearings, especially when close to the dead centres ; for the engine must be con-

structed to resist the iiiaximmu strain, even though it be during an inconsiderable

portion of the stroke only. I am acquainted with a case where high pressure, high

rate of expansion, combined with great steadiness of motion were required and in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

order that this threefold object should be accomplished, a pair of condensing-engines

Avere compounded with a pair of high-pressure engines, the four engines working
all in a block, each engine receiving only its own strain, and all coupled together
by means of the pinions upon the line-shaft. Here we have four engines dividing

amongst them, with the most satisfactory results, the work which might be done

by a single engine of larger dimensions. The strain is equalized over the different

cranks, fly-wheel, shafts,  segments, wheels, and bearings                                                                                                                       there is the most exqui-

site steadiness of motion, gi-eat economy of fuel, and a complete absence of break-

downs and accidents. These four engines have now been working in combination

several years without accident or breakdown ; and this, in itself, is no slight advan-
tage. Greater economy in steam might be realized by cutting off earlier in the

stroke, and more work might be got from the engine by cutting off later ; but it is

not always easy, neither may it be desirable, to alter existing arrangements. The

fact which has already been noted in tlie boiler reappears in the steam-engine
that by economizing fuel to the utmost less work is got out of the boiler, so by

economizing steam to the utmost, less Avork is got out of the steam-engine. If the

pressure upon the piston be 60 lbs. to the inch continued throughout the entire
strolce, the maxiiuum amoimt of work is got from the engine but in this case there

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

is no gain from expansion : but if the initial pressure be 00 lbs., and the cut-off be at

one eighth of the stroke, the gain from expansion is considerable ; but the average
pressure is 2.3 lbs. onlj^, being considerably less than half the work which the
engine is able and which it was constructed to perform. Every part of the engine

will have been made to stand safely the maximum pressure of 60 lbs., without

which it would break to pieces at once ; the difference between this and the
minimum is so much strength thrown away. Thus we find that, like every thing
else in the world, economy itself must be purchased, and sometimes at too great

a cost ; for even as regards expansion there is a limit at which it ceases to be

profitable.

   The steam-engine may be made into a valuable adjunct to the boiler as an instru-

ment for the generation of heat, by retaining and restoring to the boiler a consi-

derable portion of the waste heat, which has already done its work as a motive

power. Primarily this is done by using a portion of the injection-water ; but the

beneficial result may be considerably enhanced by causing this water to travel

through a series of copper pipes which receive the impact of the steam on its

Apassage from the cylinder to the condenser.  considerable amount of waste heat

may thus be recovered and utilized, and the injection-water itself is also correspond-

ingly economized.

   Compounding under its difierent aspects is here recommended ; nor is there any
thing in it opposed to scientific or mechanical simplicity. Compound the boiler

for public use.

   This diflers from other projects bearing a similar title, in which carriages ana
engines are swung, pannierwise, on either side of a raised rail, beam, or wire.
Mr. Thomas has utilized the scientific principles which maintain the bicycle
and its rider balanced when in motion. In Mr. Thomas's central-rail railway the
engine and carriages are on a level with, or above, the central rail, and run upon
double-flanged wheels ranged in one line down the longitudinal centre of the train.

Balance-wheels, which may be applied in several different ways, are only used to
prevent undue swaying when the train is in motion, or to preserve its balance
when starting or stopping.

   The central rail in combiiiation with two lines of wooden sleepers, parallel with
and slightly lower in their level than the central rail, to receive the touch of side
balance-wheels, is the form recommended for the colonies. In this case three lines
of metals, of the same level, are laid for some little distance in and out of stations.

    There are several indications in the Bradford district that iron was manufactured
 here at a remote period of antiquity. It is believed that the liomans both got and
worked ironstone in the neighbourhood. Dr. Richardson, the eminent botanist,
 writing to Hearne nearly 200 years ago, stated that iron was made in the neigh-
bourhood of Bierley, two or three miles from Bradford, in the time of the Romans,
 as upon a heap of cinders being removed to repair the highway there, he had dis-

covered a quantity of copper Roman coins. The ironstone cropped out in several
places, and in many others it lay very near the surface, so that with making " bell

 pits " there would be no ditficulty in getting the ironstone. Within a few miles of
 Bradford there are at work the old established and still flourishing works of
 Kirkstall Forge, which claim to have been the first establishment to use rolls
 for slitting iron into nail-rods, this process having been carried on there so far

back as the year 1594. Thus Bradford and the district may claim to have made
Roman implements of warfare, and most probably Saxon, Norman, and old English

'ones likewise. In fact this department was carried on up to a very recent period,
when the Bowling and Low-Moor Works manufactured cast-iron guns and mortars.

At or abaut 17.Si Jam ^3 Watt was completing lii3 inveutioii of a rotary motion
steam-engine, the introduction of which was oulj' required to inaugurate a new era

in the history of the iron trade. It was about this time that the Bowling Iron-
works were commenced, the first furnace being blown in in the year 1788. Even
before that date, however, we have records of some part of the works being in
existence, and doing a limited trade in foundry and smith work. But as works

for the smelting of ores, they date from the year 1788, three years in advance of

the sister works at Low Moor. This was the beginning of the trade of the best
Yorkshire irons, now so famous for their qualities through the entire civilized
world. The Bowling Ironworks may properly be considered, therefore, the pioneer

of that great prosperity which has rendered Bradford famous amongst the commer-

cial marts of the world.

   The population of the borough when the Bowling works were started could only

have been about 10,000, as thirteen years later (in 1801) it was not more than 13,264,
whereas the present population is over 150,000. The establishing of works of this

kind, at which employment for a considerable number of men would be ensured,
must at that period have been regarded as an event of much importance. John

Sturges, of Sandal, Wakefield, an ironmaster of repute, was the first to broach the

idea of establishing ironworks on the ground they now stand, and to his know-

ledge of the necessary minerals to produce a superior iron is to be attributed the

choice of the situation.

   The engine originally erected for blowing purposes was burnt down a few years
after it had been at work, and was replaced by the one called the " Old Blast
Engine " now existing. This was considered to be a great improvement upon the

first one, as the valve-gear was made self-acting. Below the engine, and con-

structed in massive masonry work, was made the air-chamber for equalizing the

Apressure of the blast.  bar-mill and a plate-mill were started soon afterwards,

and were also driven by a steam-engine, a considerable portion of which was con-

Westructed on the spot.  find it stated in Smiles's ' Lives of Boulton and Watt

that notice was given to the Bowling Ironworks, near Bradford, of proceedings
against the company for the recovery of dues. On this the Bowling Company

offered to treat, and young Watt went down to Leeds for the purpose of meeting
the representatives of the Bowling Company on the subject. On the 24th February,

--1796, he wrote his friend JMatthew Robinson Boulton as follows : " Enclosed you

have a copy of the treaty of peace, not amity, concluded at Leeds on Saturday last

between me, Minister Plenipotentiary to your Highness on the one part, and the

Bowling Pirates in person on the otlier part. I hope you will ratify the terms, as

you will see they are founded entirely upon the principle of indemnity for the past

and security for the future." On referring to the private ledger of these works of

that date, we find that the treaty of peace referred to was purchased at the price

of £1640.                                                             ·'

The  substratum  around  Bowling  _   part  of  the  most  extensive  and valuable  coal-

                                  is

field in England, stretching from Derby or Nottingham to this district, a distance

of sixty miles, and ranging about eight miles broad. The seam of coal called the

"better bed," which is one of the valuable elements necessary for the production

of the best quality of iron, is seated upon a peculiar hard siliceous sandstone termed

" galliard," immediately above the black-bed coal, and resting upon it is an argil-

laceous stratum of the mean thickness of two yards, in which lies imbedded, in

irregular layers, the valualjle ironstone of this district. The stone wears a dark

brown appearance, and yields about 32 per cent, of iron. Both coals are cakino-

coals, and moderately hard. The ash of the black-bed coal is of a dark purple gold

colour, similar to rna«ted pyrites. This coal contains a very large percentage of
pyrites in a state of intimate mixture in the coal, so that it cannot be seen ; the
ash fuses readily, is slightly alkaline (due to lime), and contains sulphide of iron

and a very large quantity of oxide. The works comprise six cold-blast furnaces,
from which about 3(30 tons of pig-iron are run per week, five refineries, twenty-one

puddliug-furnaces, forty heating-furnaces, an extensive forge, a tyre-mill for rolling

steel and iro.i wekUess tyres, one guide-mill, one bar-mill, with lo-in. rolls, and

plates can be rolled of the largest superficial area e^-er yet attempted. There

are also extcDsive steelworks for making- crucible steel, having about 100 ppt-

fumaces, which are now in process of extension and improvement by the erection
of new furnaces on the Siemens and Siemens-Martin principle, to be worked

by Siemens's regenerative gas-furnaces. Engineering works comprise foxmdry,

smithy, boiler-fitting, millwright, wheelwi'iglit, and fitting shops.

   The Bowling Company itself supplies almost all the coal and ironstone which it

consumes, its collieries extending five or six miles in various directions, and the
main pits being connected together and with the ironworks by tramways worked

with wire ropes. The total length of these tramways is 21 miles, the number of
pits 42, and the number of hands employed in them is more than 2000. To work

the pits 61 steam-engines are required, having cylinders varying from 7 to 70 inches

in diameter, and to supply them with steam 81 steam-boilers are required of from

10- to 50-liorse power each. In the ironworks are 3 blast-engines, with blowing

cylinders van'ing from 76 to 81 inches in diameter, and 14 engines of from 20- to

CO-horse power, to give motion to the various machines, besides numerous small
engines driving separate machines and pumping water for the boilers. The_ number

of steam-hammers is 13, and helve-hamniers 2. The supply of steam is main-
tained by 33 boilers, of from 20- to 60-horse power each. The number of hands

employed at the ironworks is upwards of 1000, thus making a total of upwards of

3000. ' The yield per cent, on the raw ore is 32 per cent, of iron, and on the calcined

ore 42 per cent, of iron. The following are the relative quantities of minerals for

calcined ore, 2 tons 7 cwt. 1 qr. 26 lbs. ; limestone ore, 18 cwt. 2 qrs. 12 lbs. ; coke

ore, 2 tons 5 cwt. qr. 9 lbs. The quantity of pig-iron used to produce one ton

of bar-iron (finished) is 1 ton 12 cwt. 1 qr. 25 lbs. The limestone is obtained from

Skipton, and is called locally " Skipton old rock."

The following is an analysis of Bowling pig-iron :

   The sulphur in all the samples varies only very slightly, and may in fact be con-

sidered identical, the difference in the results not being more than those due to the

en-ors of experiment. The phosphorus in all the samples exists in precisely the
same quantity, the whole of this element present in the ore combining with the
iron. The author exhibited a sketch of the original blast-furnace at Bowling, now
in existence, and working to within two or three weeks, presuming it might be

interesting to some of the members of the Association. He has been toldby some

of the oldest inhabitants of Bowling that there was only one tuyereat first; but
two have now been used for many years, the nozzles being 2f in. diameter, and
the pressure of blast supplied to this and the other furnaces 32 ounces. The iron
for plates and bars is taken direct to the refineries or oxidizing hearths. The

metal is placed upon the hearlh, covered with coke, and a blast is forced over the

surface. Two tons of refined or plate metal are produced from each charge, which

is run into moulds cooled by water, the refined metal being about 2 inches thick

and 12 feet long by 4 feet broad. From the refineries the plate, or refined metal,

is taken to the puddling-furnaces for conversion into malleable iron in the usual

manner, by charges of about 3 cwt. at a time, and each puddling-furnace is charged
ten times a day. The quality of the iron necessitates more attention from the

puddler than the commoner classes of iron ; and to insure the extra attention and

a uniform quality, a premium is given to tlie puddlers who Lave produced the Lest
specimens during a turn. The puddled iron is taken under the steam-hammer to
knock out the slag and impurities, and is made into what are called "stampings"
and " nobhlins." The stampings are broken into several pieces under fall-hammers,
piled, heated, taken under a steam-hammer, and made into blooms or billets, in
which state they are taken to the bar- or guide-mill, reheated, and rolled into round
or square bars, angle-irons, rods, or such other shapes as may be required. The
nobblins are piled, heated, taken rmder the steam-hammer, and made into blooms

or slabs of various sizes, and afterwards to the plate-mill, where they are reheated

and rolled into plates. From stampings are made the Bowling-iron weldless tyres.

A hole about 5 inches in diameter is punched through the centre of the bloom,

forming it into a ring of iron. The ring thus made is hooked on the back of an
anvil, and is hammered with a suitably shaped hammer-head to raise up the flange,
the ring being constant^ rotated on the Beck between the blows of the hammer,
so that all parts may be evenly worked. At the end of this process the ring begins
to have some resemblance to a tyre, and is then rolled out.

   The steelworks were erected in the year 1806, and the steel manufactured is
crucible steel, produced in the ordinary manner in furnaces heated by coke. The
iron used is scrap from Bowling plates, and its conversion into steel is efiected by
the addition of suitable quantities of carbon, chiefly introduced by Spiegeleisen,
and also by a mixture of ^teel scrap. Of the steel produced, a part is used fop
making tyi'es from ingots in a similar manner to iron tyres and general forgings
and a considerable portion is used for making castings of all descriptions, where
strength, with lightness, is the desideratum. Arrangements are now being made,
and are partly completed, for applying Siemens's gas process for melting the
crucible steel in suitable furnaces ; and a Siemens-Martin's furnace is also in
course of erection for the conversion of pig-iron into steel, which will produce four

tons of steel at one operation.

   The engineering is done in an extensive range of buildings, where the whole
of the work and new plant required to keep the collieries and works described in

repair are made. This department is also devoted to the construction of engines,
boilers, &c. for the market. In the model-room (one of the finest in the country)

is a model from which the first wheel was cast for Blenkinsop's locomotive. The
boiler-shop is now being extended, so as to be capable of producing from two to
three boilers per week, besides all descriptions of plate-nanging. The foimdrj'

has been recently rebuilt iipon the old site.
   The distinguished qxialities of the Bowling iron are hardness with great plia-

bility, homogeneity and uniformity of texture, capability of withstanding the action
of fire and of receiving a brilliant polish, it being used extensively in the Sheffield

trades on account of the last-named virtue. Works established in the infancy of

the iron trade, and producing a superior quality of metal (quality being always
preferred to quantity whenever the alternative presented itself), must naturally be
disposed to conservatism. Besides, repeated experiences have proved the necessity

of keeping to the original mode of working with the minerals and iron. It is
rarely known to what purposes or tests the iron may be put to on leaving the
premises ; but it is known that it ynll have to withstand usage such as no common
iron or any other iron but charcoal iron perhaps could do, and it was for the latter
tJiat the Bowling iron was oi-iginallj' manufactured as a substitute. Keeping in
view the production of a uniform quality, changes of whatever description have
been jealously regarded, and those that have been made have only been arrived at
by very gradual stages.

Notes of some Experiments on the Gonducting-powers for Heat of certain Books,

   ivith Bemarl-s on the Geolofjical Aspects of the Investigation. By Prof. A. S.

   Herschei, and G. A. Lebotje, F.G.S.

A subject of considerable interest in a physical and geological point of view, as

illustrating the questions of underground temperature that have recently occupied

the attention of a Committee of the British Association, presented itself as open to

much more extensive experimental investigation than perhaps, from the absence

of anv immediate practical applications of its results, it has hitherto been thought

worthy to receive. The object which the authors of this communication proposed

to themselves was to determine experimentally the actual conducting-powers for

heat of as many well-defined and commonly occurring species of geological rocks as

they could conveniently obtain, and submit to the test of some suitable and practical

Amethod of experiment.  collection of more than twenty specimens of rocks of the

best-marked descriptions were for this purpose selected at the well-known Marble

and Stone Works at Newcastle-on-Tyne, of Messrs. Walker, Emley, and Beall,

who at the same time undertook to reduce the blocks (together with some addi-

tional materials obtained elsewhere) to a uniform size and shape, to Avhich they are

mall gauged with the greatest care. ' The plates are circular, five inches diameter

and half an inch thick-, and were thus chosen as being nearly of tiie same dimensions

as those employed by Peclet in his investigations of the conducting-powers of

various substances for heat. Considerable labour and risk, however, is incurred in

working plates of granite and the harder stones of such thinness ; and (as the result

has shown) the measurements of their heat-conducting powers would have been

rendered both more exact and easier had a thickness of about one inch instead of
Ahalf an inch been adopted for the plates.
                                            list rf the specimens employed is

annexed below; and it will be seen that among rocks of very wide distribution but

of more friable materials, as chalk, coal, sand, or marl, and some more recent sedi-

mentary contributions to the earth's crust, no attempt to include them in these

measurements has yet been made.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  _.
   The pui-pose of the present note is simply to establish from the preliminary ob-

servations the general bad conducting-powers of the harder rocks, and to corro-

borate, in the case of a few examples that were numerically reduced, the conclusions

of a similar description that were obtained by Peclet.  _

Description of the Apparatus.---In order to heat the rocks, a flat-topped circular
tin boiler was provided of the same diameter as the rock plates, upon which they

could be laid so as to be exposed on their lower side to the heat of boihng water.

The steam produced by the water at the bottom of the boiler rises through a central

tube to the top, where it circulates in a steam-space formed by a perforated dia-

phragm placed round the top of the tube, and it emerges from the side of the boiler

at the bottom of the annular space formed between the boiler and the central tube.
The upper part of the boiler is surrounded to about an inch in depth (the depth

of the steam-space) bv a thick ring of wood resting upon a projecting ledge of the
boiler, and protecting'it, as well as the slab of rock placed inside it upon the flat
lid of the boiler, from loss of heat to the surrounding air. The ring of wood pro-

jects above the rock so as to receive a flat-bottomed tin vessel (.shaped like a conical

'flask) of water, of the same diameter as the rock plate at the base, and contracting

at the top to a narrow neck, in which a theinuometer is inserted by a cork. hen"S^S
the apparatus is in use, a light packing of cotton-wool is inserted between the
wooden ring and its contents, to keep them more efiectually from contact with the

outer air.

 supposed tliat by including the rock to be tested between the temperature of boiling
 water on one side, and that of spi-ing-cold water in the thermometer Hask on the
 other side, the required conditions of a known difference of temperature would be
 attained, while the rate of ascent of the thermometer in the colder vessel at the
 same time marks the quantity of heat transmitted. But so far are the two surfaces
 of the rock specimens from taking up the temperatures of the metal plates with
 which they are in contact, that, with the rough means of determining their real tem-
 peratures which were first employed, »o sensible difference xchatever could be observed
 between them ! The small difference which without doubt exists is suiEcient to
' transmit the small quantity of heat which passes, and the whole rock plate assumes
 very nearly the mean degree of temperature between that of the boiler on one side,
 and of the" cold-water flask on its other side. In this state of uncertainty regarding
 the effective difference of temperature, it is quite obvious that no conclusions of the
 nature of a numerical comparison can be made between the various rock sections
 but a trial of each was yet made in the apparatus in order to determine the rate of

flow of the transmitted heat.

   Out of six specimens thus tried, slate plates cut parallel to the plane of cleavage

transmitted the heat faster than any of the others. When the flow of heat had

become uniform, the water was raised I'' F. in thirty-two seconds. With marble,

sandstone, granite, and serpentine, about thirty-nine seconds were required to raise
it by the same amount. The greatest resistance to the passage of heat was offered
by two specimens of shale (grey and black) from the Coal-measiu-es in the neigh-
bourhood of Newcastle, which occupied forty-eight or fifty seconds in raising the

water one degree, ot half as long again as the time taken by the plate of slate.
The black shale is highly fossiliferous, and it allows heat to pass more slowly
than the other harder and more compact grey species of the same kind of

rock.

These experiments were not extended further, as uncertainty regarding the real

temperatures to which the surfaces  of  the plates were  exposed  introduced an im-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          .

known element into the question of their conducting-powers. Some experiments,

however, were made, which makes it probable that this difficulty can be removed.

It was found that the flow of heat is very little diminished by lifting the slabs of

rock off the heating plate, and also separating them to various distances from the

thermometric flask by introducing felt wads of a few different thicknesses between

Athe surfaces.  film of air (as already observed by Peclet, or of water if steam or

water is used to heat the plates) adheres to and protects their surfaces by its bad

conducting-power from becoming hot or cold, and thus opposes a certain resistance

to the passage of the heat. It is not improbable that the resistance thus produced
is the same for fi-esh cut and smoothly ground surfsices of all the different kinds of

rock ; and by using difl'erent thicknesses of one of them its amoimt might be deter-
mined and employed as a correction in estimating the conducting-powers of all the
other kinds of rock subjected to the trials. Although the results of this method
would certainly be of the greatest interest in connexion with man}' practical con-
trivances for transmitting heat from liquid or gaseous to solid bodies, and the
reverse, yet a less circuitous method, as afibrding the desired results more speedily
to present them to tlie Brilish Association, seemed to be preferable, and the follow-
ing direct observations were therefore adopted in their stead.

  A slender iron wire was joined at its two ends by twisting them on to two pieces

of similar platinum wire, which were coniiected by long copper wires with the
terminals of a Thomson's reflecting galvanometer provided Avith a millimetre scale.
Wlien the two platinum and iron j unctions were warmed to different degrees, the
galvanometer showed the difference between their temperatures on its scale. The
twisted junctions were fastened on the tops of two small corks, so that they could

be pressed against the surfaces of the rock ; and in one arrangement the corks were
attached to the heating and cooling plates of the heat-apparatus, and the thermo-
electric couples were thus supported by the corks so as to touch the rocks. In this

position they recorded the state of temperature of the plate of stone ('/( situ, Avhile

the heat conducted through it was at the same time being measured by the ther-
mometer. The divisions of the galvanometer scale were themselves estimated in

Fahrenheit degrees by inserting a double tin lid between the corks, under the two
opposite faces of which water of different degrees of temperature was made to cir-
culate, and the temperature of the water was made Ivuown by thermometers inserted

in the lids. The other arrangement consisted in iixing the corks to the ends of a
pair of wooden tongs, so tliat the rock plate could be pressed between them as soon
as it was taken oft" the heater. It was in a first trial of this last arrangement that
no perceptible signs of heat-difference could be observed between the rock-faces.

To increase the actual difference, however, the edge of one of the stone plates was

surrounded with a band of paper, and the upper surface was then covered with
mercury, upon which the thermometer-flask was placed, this liaving also been filled

with m'ercurj^ instead of water to accelerate conduction. On taking the rock (a

plate of white marble) out of the apparatus after this treatment, and testing its
thermal difl'erence with the galvanometer, it was found that one surface was about

7° F. hotter than the other, while the flask containing 9 lbs. of mercury was

heated 1° F. in about ten seconds. This corresponds to the passage of 330 heat-

imits per hour through a 1-inch plate of the same rock (1 square foot in surface-area),

with the same difference of temperature on its opposite sides of about 7° F. For a

difference of 1° the transmission of heat in the same time would be 47 heat-units,

while the value obtained by Peclet for tine-graiued white marble was 28 heat-units

per hour. It is evident that some of the diflFerence of temperature between the sur-

faces of the plate subsided and disappeared in lifting it out of the heating-apparatus

and transferring it to the galvanometer, so as to make the conducting-power of the
plate appear to be about half as great again as its known value. The galvanometer,

which at first marked 7°, rapidly sank to zero as the rock was moved about between

the cork projections.

The other disposition of the iron-platinum couples (on corks fixed to the heating

and absorbing plates) touching the rock-surfaces dining the heating operation, was

found to introduce errors in the opposite direction by showing, apparently irom the

conducting-power of the cork supports, greater temperature differences of the sur-

faces than can reasonably be supposed to have existed. Thus with the same plate

of white marble a temperature difference of 50° F. was recorded, instead of 7° F.

as in the  former  case                        while 264 heat-units  per hour was  the  rate of conduction
                                            ;

through a plate of standard size for that difference, corresponding to only 5^ heat-

units for a difference of one degree, and not exceeding a fifth part of the value found

by Peclet. The same process was tried with the tAvo kinds of shale, and showed, as
before, that their conductiug-power is much less than that of fine-grained marble,

the quantities found for their conducting-powers being 2| and 2 heat-units per
hour, or less than half as great as that of marble. The heat-conducting power of

ordinary calcareous stone is similarly found by Peclet to be about half as great as

that of fine-grained marble, the hatter varying between 22 and 28, and the former

between 11 and 13 ; and the results of further trials will, without doubt, confirm
more closely the exact values which he assigns.

   Had time allowed the experiments to be repeated with a new arrangement of

the apparatus, the sources of error peculiar to each of the above methods would

have been readily removed, as their origin is in each case easily explained ; and
another series will be undertaken with the excellent collection of rock sections that

have now been provided for them. In drawing up this description of the first trials

to which they were subjected, it is sufficiently interesting to observe that not only

the relative values but also the absolute quantities of the heat-conducting powers

of different substances obtained by Peclet are approximately confirmed, since certain

kinds of stone are found to have less than half the conducting-powers of other kinds

and in the case of marble the quantity of heat passing through a square-foot plate
one inch thick per hour, with a difference of 1° F. between the opposite faces, was

found in two trials (giving the conductivity respectively in excess and defect) to le

between 42 or 47 and 5 or 7 heat-units, while the value of certain marbles found
by Peclet varied from 22 to 28 heat-units. The corresponding numbers obtained
by Peclet for certain metals, as copper, iron, and lead, are 515, 233, 113 heat-units

per hour, or many times greater than those of terrestrial rocks. The latter

occupy an intermediate place between the metals and such substances as the Aariou.s

on shale. When the experiments in hand have been repeated and largely added to,

it is hoped that this accession or loss of couducting-power in connexion with

the ordinary agents of geological force may be (perhaps only approximately)

expressed numerically. One might even suppose that the disturbance of heat-
transmitting equilibrium has something to do with the distribution of volcanic and
thermal phenomena. Without, however, treading further on such dangerously
speculative ground, we may hope, by dint of careful experiment of the kind now
brought before the Section, to throw some light on the curious discrepancy which
is constantly being noted in observations of underground temperature taken at
different places, the j-afe of transmission of heat (for which we hope to make in
time lists and tables) being manifestly intimately connected with that subject.

celestial phenomenon, that one is tempted to refer to them first of all. No more truthful or

striking representations have ever been laid before his readers, b}' any student of science."

means intend thereby to imply that the text is of secondary importance. In fact, the liiore
carefully the text is read, tlic more obvious docs it become that Mr. Nasmyth has used his

work which is not only a very beautiful and a ^ery readable one, but one of some importance."

statesman could not write the lives of great lawyers without interweaving curious infonuation
and suggesting valuable principles of judgment and useful practical maxims. Their principal

  "A little book, cvidt'iitly the production of a man of deep and lliorougli piety, yet so

cultivated that his thoughts when hing sick unto deatli have thrown themselves into definite
foi-m, and shaped themsehcs into tliat older kind of statelier, or as some now-a-days say, of
stiflcr eloquence, to which we arc accustomed in South, and in a few of those half-forgotten
masterpieces of the English Church. The eloquence, however, is not artificial, but pours itself
out, as if it were, like poetry to a poet, the rational mode of expression of the mind when heated
with a sense of the nearness of the Divine. There is in this volume much of the charm
derived by so many minds from ' II Peuseroso.' " Spectator.
