Report of the Council of the British Association as presented
   TO THE General Committee at Cheltenham, August 6th, 1856.

   a. The Council have the satisfaction of reporting the continued efficiency
and progress toward higher usefulness of the Observatory at Kew, which,
while it fulfils the original object of its foundation, and readily takes up
original research, is now a point of reference for Standard Instruments in
meteorology, and auxiliary to the national service.

    b. In conducting this establishment, the Council have in previous years
had the great benefit of the cooperation of the Royal Society, and the Re-

port of the Committee of the Observatory, which is now laid on the table,
will show that this highly valued cooperation is continued. The Members
will learn from the Report the final result of the Correspondence between
the Committee of the Observatory and the Authorities of the Board of
 Public Works, concerning the repairs of the building and the laying-on of
 gas. The disadvantages which might have resulted from the unexpected
 issue of this correspondence have been removed by the prompt liberality of
 the Council of the Royal Society, who have advanced the necessary funds

 for immediately supplying the Observatory with gas.

    c. The Council suggest to tiie General Committee to tender its cordial
 thanks to the Royal Society for the effective assistance thus given to an In-
 stitution in which both the Royal Society and the British Association recog-

 nize a powerful instrument of philosophical research.

    REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.  XXlX

   d. The Council have the pleasure to forward another Report from the
vigilant Committee which asserts the interests of Science in Parliament.
By what means of a public nature the Progress of Science can be accelerated

--and assured ; the Benefits of Science applied and extended ; the Position

ofthe Cultivators of Science amended; these questions must strongly interest
the Association, which, at the outset, declared its purpose to strive for the
removal of all impediments of a public nature by which Science is retarded.
Recommending this Report of the Parliamentary Committee to the approba-
tion of the General Committee, and the important subjects which it opens
to the serious deliberation of the Members, the Council beg to express their
readiness to be instrumental in maturing and putting into action any mea-
sure which the Association may deem suitable, and in obtaining the coope-
ration of other scientific bodies to bring it to a good issue.

   e. The Council may congratulate the Association on the progress made

--toward the fulfilment of the 7th Recommendation in the Report of their

Parliamentary Committee for 1854-5 "That an appropriate building, in
some central situation in London, should be provided, at the expense of the
nation, in which the principal scientific societies maybe located together:"
Burlington House is now devoted to the use of the Royal, Linnean, and

--Chemical Societies a result due in a great degree to the prudent and per-

severing efforts of the Royal Society.

  f The General Committee will learn with satisfaction that, according to

the Report of the General Treasurer, the Funds belonging to the Associa-
tion, and invested in the names of the Trustees, amount to Б5000. The
Council suggest that it is desirable, for many reasons, to maintain a reserve
of this iiind, sufficient to meet unexpected contingencies, which may arise in
consequence of efforts for the advancement of science.

   g. The Council have added to the List of Corresponding Members the
following Foreign men of Science :

                                     Dr. F. Cohn, Breslau.
                                     Prof. E. Fremy, Paris.

XXX REPORT 1856.

   k. It was resolved
That the cordial thanks of the Council be tendered to the Lord Wrottesley

       and the Officers and Council of the Royal Society, for the promptitude
       with which they have responded to the request of the British Associa-

     tion, in granting the sum of Б250 for the purpose of lighting the Kew

       Observatory with gas.

Report of the Kew Committee, presented to the Council of the British

                               Association, August 6. 1856.

The Committee beg to submit the following Report of their proceedings

since the meeting of the British Association at Glasgow :

The instruments and apparatus sent by the Committee to the Paris Exhi-

bition were returned to the Observatory in December last. The total expense

incurred by the Committee in connexion with the Exhibition amounted to

Б202 : 7*. 1 Id., exceeding by Б62 : 7s. 1 Id. the sum of Б140 granted by the

Board of Trade. This balance has since been repaid by the Board.

At the last Meeting of the Association, your Committee presented a Special

Report relative to their application to Her Majesty's Government for the use

of two acres of land contiguous to the Observatory, and the lighting of the

--building with gas, such applications having been made in consequence of

the recommendation of the General Committee at the Liverpool Meeting.

The Association is still compelled to pay the high rent of ten guineas per

acre for the land. The Committee fully expected that this year they should

have been enabled to report that the expense of lighting the Observatory

with gas would have been defrayed by t!ie Government. The President of

the Board of Works at first intimated to the Committee that the subject

would receive consideration, and subsequently that he would consider the

propriety of including the amount in the estimates for the present year. On

Afurther application, however, this has been refused.      copy of the corre-

spondence is annexed to this Report.

Your Committee have, however, the gratification of reporting, that on a

representation of the circumstances being submittec^ by the Council of the

Association to the President and Council of the Royal Society, the sum of
Б250 from the Wollaston Fund was immediately placed at the disposal of

the Committee, in order that no further delay from the want of funds should

take place in effecting the long-desired object.

   Much as the Committee may regret the refusal of the Board of Works to

grant their request, they gladly avail themselves of this opportunity to express

to Lord Wrottesley and the Council of the Royal Society their thanks for
the prompt manner in which the intimation was made to them that the money
had been voted. Jt affords another proof how ready the Royal Society has

ever been to forward and assist scientific investigations.

   Mr. De la Rue has made a preliminary examination of one of the Huy-

genian object-glasses, namely, that of 122 feet focal length, and, so far as

he has hitherto been enabled to judge, it would appear that this object-glass

defines with tolerable precision ; but he is not yet able to say whether it
will be desirable to go to the expense of erecting the tower for celestial

observations.

  A paper by Mr. Welsh, descriptive of the Kew Standard Barometer, and

of the apparatus and processes employed in the verification of barometers,

has been communicated to the Royal Society by the Chairman, and is now

being printed in the Transactions of the Society.

REPORT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.                                     XXH

   The following statement shows the number of meteorological instruments
which have been verified at Kew during the past year :

                                                                  100
For the Admiralty and Board of Trade .... 360                90

For the Portuguese Government                                12

For Opticians and others       170 35

Total                          530 137 100

 --On February 5, the Committee resolved, " That, in consideration of the

number of Barometers already verified at Kew having been sufficient to

defray the preliminary expense of apparatus, the charge for verification shall

in future be reduced to five shillings each instrument."

Arrangements have been made with Messrs. Adie, Casella, and Negretti

and Zambra, to have on hand a constant supply of verified marine meteoro-

logical instruments, and the Public may be supplied through any respectable

Optician in London or the country at the following prices :

For a Marine Barometer         Б4; 4
For a Set of Six Thermometers    22

    Since the last Report, the Committee have disposed of 60 standard ther-
mometers, graduated at the Observatory. Of these, 14 have been made for
Mr. Hopkins, to be employed in his experiments on the eff"ect of pressure
upon the melting-points of solids. The charge on account of the graduation
and distribution of these thermometers is arranged with the Government
Grant Committee of the Royal Society, and consequently does not appear in

the financial accounts of the Kew Committee.

  A self-recording Anemometer, for measuring the velocity of the wind on

the plan of Dr. Robinson, has been completed at the Observatory by Mr.
Beckley : it is erected upon the dome, and has been in regular operation since
the 1st of January. Its performance is most satisfactory, the delicacy of its
indications being so great, that during the last six months the whole period

of "calm," as shown by the registrations, has been only fotir hours. It has

not yet been possible to erect an apparatus for registering the direction of
the wind, on account of difficulties arising from the anticipated use of the

dome for the solar photographic telescope. The direction of the wind has,

however, been observed five times daily from an ordinary vane.
   Mr. Beckley has since submitted to the Committee a model of a new

arrangement for a self-recording Anemometer, in which the registration of

both the direction and velocity of the wind (and also the fall of rain if

desired) is obtained upon a single sheet of paper. This arrangement is much
more compact in its design and less costly in construction than any other
with which the Committee are acquainted. Mr. Beckley 's model will be
exhibited, and a description of it communicated to this Meeting.

  A series of monthly determinations of the absolute horizontal force and

of the magnetic dip was commenced in January, with instruments provided
by General Sabine from his department at Woolwich. Some difficulties
have been experienced by Mr. Welsh in the observations of the absolute
horizontal force, owing to imperfections in the usual mode of suspension of
the magnets during the observations of vibration. These difficulties he

hopes soon to overcome by employing reversible collimator magnets, and by
an improved mode of suspension.
xxxii                   --REPORT 1856.

A convenient apparatus has been constructed at the Observatory for the

determination of the effect of temperature on magnets : with this apparatus

the temperature coefficients of the magnets employed at the Toronto Obser-

vatory have been obtained. The scale of the unifilar, and the dimensions

and weights of the inertia rings employed at the same Observatory, have

been determined with reference to the Kew standards of length and weight.
   Two dip circles, one for M. Hansteen of Christiania, and the other for

Dr. Pegado of the Meteorological Observatory of Lisbon, have been ex-

amined and compared with the Kew instrument before being sent to those

Agentlemen.   30-inch transit inslrument, lent by General Sabine's depart-

Ament, has been erected in the south window of the old transit room.

clock by Shelton, the property of the Royal Society, is used with it.

Owing to alterations required in the dome in order to adapt it to the use

of the solar photographic telescope, it has been necessary to remove the large

electrical apparatus of Mr. Ronalds. An apparatus of smaller size, but on

the same plan, has been erected on the side of the dome, by which atmo-

spheric electrical phfenomena can be determined in the same manner as

Aheretofore.  new vane has also been constructed, having an indicating dial

within the dome.

   Dr. Halleur, who had for about six months assisted Mr. Welsh in the

Observatory, having been appointed to a professorship in the New College

of Engineering at Calcutta, left the Observatory in September last.

In February, the Committee, on the recommendation of Professor J. D.

Forbes, engaged Mr. Balfour Stewart of the Edinburgh University, as

Assistant Observer, at a yearly salary of Б80, with residence in the Obser-

vatory. Mr. Stewart commenced his duties on March 1. The Committee

regret having to report that the Observatory will shortly lose the services

of this gentleman, who has recently been appointed an assistant to Pro-

fessor Forbes : he will leave the Observatory on October 1, previous to

which the Committee hope to be able to appoint a successor.

The Committee refer with pleasure to an ingenious thermometer devised

by Mr. Stewart, in which advantage has been taken of the difference of ca-

pillary force and friction in two tubes of different capacity connected with the

same bulb, to measure the sum of the fluctuations of temperature. The in-

strument has been made at the expense of the Committee ; a description of it

has been communicated by Mr. Stewart to the Royal Society, and is printed

in its " Proceedings."

Mr. Welsh reports most favourably as to the general attention evinced by

Mr. Beckley and Mr. Macgrath in the discharge of their respective duties.

Mr. Beckley 's talent as a mechanical engineer renders his services of great

value in an establishment where instances constantly occur of work requiring

the highest skill being promptly and correctly executed : the assiduity of

Mr. Macgrath has been such as to merit the entire approbation of Mr. Welsh.

Your Committee cannot close this Report without again recording their

high opinion of the unremitting care and attention, as well as of the ability

which has ever been displayed by Mr. Welsh, as the Superintendent of the

Observatory ; during the past year he was compelled for upwards of six weeks

to be in Paris, in order to arrange the delivery of the valuable scientific appa-

ratus forwarded at the request of Her Majesty's Government by the Committee

to the Paris Exhibition ; but his arrangements were such, that the general
business of the Observatory was not in any way suspended during his absence.

Your Committee have finally to report, that the total expenses of the Ob-

servatory during the past year amount to Б557 : \s. 9d. In consequence of

the Committee having received during the year the sum of Б221 : 7*. 8d. for

the verification of meteorological instruments, they have in hand a balance
amounting to Б260 : 4s. 6c?. ; they do not consider it therefore necessary
to apply to the Association for a larger sura than Б350, to enable them to
meet the expenses of the ensuing year.

                                   By order of the Committee,
                                                            John P. Gassiot, Chairman,

 --"Sir, In the interview with which you favoured the deputation from the

British Association this day, you kindly explained that you had no power to

order the Works such as we required to be executed for the Observatory in
the Old Deer Park, Richmond, without the sanction of the Lords of the
Treasury, and you suggested the advisability of my briefly explaining to you

by letter the position in which the Association stands as regards the Building,
as also of defining the exact object of our application previously to your

submitting the same to their Lordships.

   " The Building was placed at the disposition of the British Association
by Her Majesty in 184'2 for scientific purposes ; it has ever since been used
for those objects, the entire expense of the Establishment being paid by the
Association, without receiving any assistance, pecuniary or otherwise, from

Government.
   " The Committee has obtained permission from the Hon. Charles Gore,

Chief Commissioner of Woods and Forests and Land Revenues Department,

to have gas-pipes laid along the pathway through the Park to the Observatory
without any cost or indemnification being required by his department, pro-
vided the work is done in the winter months ; and the more immediate object
of the application of Colonel Sabine and myself was to request you would
order at the present time the gas-pipes to be laid on to the Observatory in
order that the Building may be properly lighted, such lighting being indis-
pensable for the carrying out various scientific investigations, and thus
enabling the Committee to fulfil with greater efficacy the purposes for which
the Building was originally granted by Her Majesty to the Association.

   " I may add, that the funds of the British Association consist of the con-
tributions of its members; from these limited means the Council have most
liberally expended of late years an annual sura of Б500 for the Observatory,
but it being unable to meet this increased expenditure, which would not ex-
ceed Б250 (the estimate is Б200), the Committee has been induced to make
this application, which we hope will not be refused.

   " In respect to the repairs alluded to by us, we merely desired to explain

that some repairs were indispensable to preserve the Building, which, if
promptly attended to, would probably save a much larger outlay at a future

period.

" The Building co\x\6. perhaps remain in its present state for a short period,

but a trifling outlay, the extent of which could be easily ascertained by the

Government Surveyor, would be all that at present is required. The Com-

mittee considered it their duty to point this out for your consideration.

may be laid on to the Observatory at Kew, and that certain repairs may be

also done to that Building at the expense of this Department, I am directed

by the Chief Commissioner of Her Majesty's Works, &c., to acquaint you

that he has caused an estimate to be made of the cost of the Works required

by the Society, which amounts to a large sum, and that there are not any

funds voted by Parliament out of which such cost can be defrayed.

ing that you may be informed whether it is arranged that the works for
laying on gas at the Observatory at Kew, and for the necessary repairs,
should now be commenced.

by this Board on the 2nd of June last, to the effect that there would be no

objection to the use of gas at the Observatory, but that the whole of the work

connected therewith must be done by, and at the expense of, the Kew Com-

mittee of the British Association, and to the satisfaction of this Board's

Officer in charge of the district.

   " I am to add, that this communication was made to you before the First
Commissioner came to this Office, and that he was not made aware of it

when he gave directions for the letter of the 5th January last to be written

to you, in which he informed you that he would consider the propriety of

including the cost attending the laying on gas and performing the repairs

therein referred to, in the Estimates of the ensuing year. His attention

having now been directed to that communication of the 2nd June last, he
is of opinion that the decision of the Board thereby conveyed must be ad-

at the Observatory, or to incur any portion of the expense attending it.

is printed in the Report of the Kew Committee. I may also state that

in an interview with Sir B. Hall, on 18th last December, both Colonel Sabine

and myself explained the particulars of my former correspondence with the
Board of Works ; this has possibly escaped Sir B. Hall's recollection, for we

left him with the impression that he would grant our request ; and this was

him in what manner the work must be done to his satisfaction.

   " From what took place at the interview with which you favoured General

Sabine, Mr. Welsh, and myself on 18th of last December, as well as from

the tenor of the letter addressed to me by Mr. Austin on 5th last January,
the Committee fully relied on the necessary amount for the proposed work

being included in the Estimates ; they regret that any circumstance should

have arisen to prevent your carrying your intentions into effect, for although

the amount may appear trifling, in comparison to many sums voted on such

occasions, it is nevertheless a large item in the income of any scientific

Society supported entirely by voluntary subscriptions ; and considering that
the British Association already devotes the large sum of Б500 per annum
for the support of the Observatory, the Committee could not anticipate that

the cost of laying on gas to a building the property of the Crown, would

have been refused by your Board.

" I have only to add, that, although nearly two months have elapsed since

the date of Mr. Austin's last letter, and upwards of sixteen months since the

subject was first communicated to your Board, I have not received any com-

munication relative to the repairs, some of which are absolutely necessary

for the preservation of the building.

xxxviii                      --REPORT 1856.

Report of the Parliamentary Committee of the British Association to
                    the Meeting at Cheltenham in August 1856.

The Parliamentary Committee have the honour to report as follows :

We have the pleasure of announcing that one very important subject to

which our labours have been directed has been materially advanced since

the date of our last Report; we allude to the juxtaposition of the Scientific

Societies of London in a convenient and central locality.

The main building at Burlington House has been placed by the Govern-

ment at the disposal of the Royal Society, on the understanding that they

accommodate the Linnean and Chemical Societies with rooms therein ; and the

West Wing will be converted into a capacious Hall, which is to be occu-

pied by the Royal Society at all times when it is not required for the

examinations and public meetings of the University of London.

  We trust that the period is not far distant in which permanent accommo-

dation will be afforded to all the principal Scientific Societies in buildings to

be erected near the same site, and in pursuance of some general plan.

Your Committee, however, anticipate most important advantages to Science

from the present partial adoption by the Government of the principle of

juxtaposition ; and our Chairman has in his address to the Royal Society on

the occasion of their last Anniversary, alluded to the benefits likely to accrue

from this salutary measure.

In the same Address also will be found a Summary of our labours since

our complete organization in 1851, a perusal of which will show to what

extent the proceedings of our Committee have justified the anticipations of

those who promoted its formation.

 --During the past year two subjects have been referred to us, viz.:

1st. The question of the expenses incurred by Scientific Institutions not

incorporated in appointing new trustees of their property, when vacancies

Weoccur. And, 2ndly.  were requested by your Council in January last

to support an application to Parliament, in reference to lighting Kew Ob-

servatory with gas, when made by the Chief Commissioner of Woods.

The first subject above adverted to has been considered by us, and we

shall resume its discussion when an opportunity offers for remedying the

evil.

  With respect to the second, we must refer to the Report of the Kew

Committee for an explanation of the reasons which have made it impossible
for us to render that species of assistance, which was contemplated at the
time when the reference was made to us.

   The most important subject of our last Report, viz. the question " whether
any measures could be adopted by the Government or Parliament that would
improve the position of Science or its Cultivators? " has since its discussion

at Glasgow been again considered by us ; and during the last Session of

Parliament it was brought before the House of Commons by Mi'. Heywood,
as an individual Member of the House, and not as representing your

Committee.

   The discussion of our Report by the Committee of Recommendations at
Glasgow in September last, the result of the debate which took, place in
the House of Commons on the occasion last referred to, and subsequent
communications with Members of the Legislature, have combined to

convince us

          1st. That men of science have as yet formed no definite opinion

on the important question raised in the Report.
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE GENERAL COMMITTEE. XXXIX

And 2ndly. That until such a result be attained, it is improbable

that any important improvement will be effected iu the position of

Science or its Cultivators either through the agency of the Government

or Parliament.

   It is desirable therefore that some measures should be adopted, which
may be instrumental in inducing scientific men generally to apply their minds

to the consideration of these questions, and to agree upon some definite
--Weproposals :
                 therefore recommend that the subject should be again

brought before the Committee of Recommendations. Meanwhile the General

Committee will be gratified on learning that the importance of the question

has been recognized by the Council of the Royal Society, who have referred

its consideration to the Government Grant Committee. That Committee

have appointed a Sub-Committee, consisting of the President and Officers

of the Royal Society and seven other Members, who will meet on the 7th

of October for the purpose of discussing the subject prior to the reassembling

of the Society after the recess.

Your Committee recommend for the consideration of the General Com-

mittee, whether it would be expedient to relax the rule by which vacancies

in our Committee must be filled up exclusively from Members of the British
Association, so far as to admit Members of either House of Parliament, who

have advanced the interests of Science.

Your Committee also recommend that two vacancies in our body, caused

by the non-attendance of the Earl Cathcart and Sir J. V. B. Johnstone,

Bart., during two consecutive years, be filled by the election of the Earl of

Burlington and Lord Stanley, Member of Parliament for King's Lynn.

General Sabine, Professor Owen, Professor Bell, Dr. Gray, Mr. Macgregor
Laird, Dr. R. Latham, and Dr. N. Shaw, be requested to wait upon Her
Majesty's Secretary for Foreign Affairs, to urge the desirableness of sending
out an annual expedition to the Niger, at the period of the rising waters of
that river (which has been proved to be the most healthy season), as proposed
by Dr. Baikie, supported by the Royal Geographical Society, and advocated
by persons deeply interested in establishing a regular commercial intercourse

with the inhabitants of that portion of Africa.
    That a Memorial be presented to the Admiralty, praying for the publica-

tion in a simple, uniform and complete shape, tabular and descriptive, of the
results of the Trials of Her Majesty's Steam Ships.

    That the Committee, consisting of Mr. Andrew Henderson, Mr. John Scott
Russell, Mr. James R. Napier, and Mr. Charles Atherton, appointed to con-
sider the question of the Measurement of Ships for Tonnage, be requested

Committee, The Right Hon. the Earl of Hardwicke, Mr. Arthur Anderson,

Rev. Dr. Woolley, Mr. Wm. Mann, Mr. George Frederic Young, Captain

J. O. Owen, Professor Woodcroft, and Mr. James Perry ; and that they be
requested to inquire into the defects of the present methods, and to frame
more perfect rules for the measurement and registration of ships; and also
as to the adoption of a standard unit for estimating the working power of
engines, instead of the present nominal horse-power, in order that a correct
and uniform principle of estimating the actual carrying capacity and working
power of steam-ships may be adopted in their future registration.

                    ADDRESS

          CHARLES DAUBENY, M.D., F.R.S.,

                      Professok of Botany in the University of Oxford.

      Gentlemen of the British Association,

Exactly twenty years have elapsed since the time when, as one of the Local
Secretaries of this Institution, at the Meeting held in Bristol, it became my-
province to lay before the Members present a Report on the progress of
Physical Science, more especially with reference to the subjects that had
been treated of in the last volume of our Transactions.

   And it was with no assumed feeling of humility that I expressed on that
occasion my lively sense of the responsibility of the task imposed upon me,
and of my own feeble qualifications for its execution.

   It is, however, with a much more pervading consciousness of my defi-

ciencies that I appear at the present time, when, addressing you as the Pre-

sident of this great Body, I see before me similar duties committed to me to

discharge.

   On the former occasion, indeed, I was at least encouraged by the reflection,
that however eminent those who had preceded me in the drawing up of such

--reports might have been, and doubtless there were amongst them some of
--our most valued associates, still, as the task had up to that time been con-

fided to the Local Secretaries, it was one to which persons of humbler preten-
sions might aspire ; nor was the general Body likely itself to be compromised
by any remarks that emanated from one of its subordinate Officers.

   But I now stand before you in quite a different capacity, following as I do
in the wake of a long train of distinguished individuals, several of whom,
indeed, as was the case with my own immediate predecessor, added to the
recommendation of extensive scientific and literary attainments, the prestige
of exalted rank and eminent social position ; whilst of the remainder many
had been peculiarly marked out for such a post, either on the ground of
their own contributions to Science, or on that of the depth and range of
their information in some of its highest departments.

   In my own case, on the contrary, I cannot but feel, that this important
office has been imposed upon me, chiefly on account of my position as the

Senior amongst the Professors of Physical Science in a neighbouring Uni-
                                                                                                                       ;

       ADDRESS.                                                                                                        Xlix

versity, which doubtless deserves the gratitude of this Association, for the
support rendered to it, when such fostering care was most needed, in the

infancy of its existence.

   And if other reasons for the selection are sought for, I would refer it also
to the accident of my birth, and to the partiality of my friends in the County
where we are now assembled, to whom I flatter myself it may be a matter
of satisfaction, to see thus distinguished, an individual whom they regard

as one of themselves, and one too who owes his position in life, and his capa-
bility of indulging in those studies which here engage us, mainly to the good

fortune of attaining, in the University alluded to, a Gloucestershire Fellow-

ship.

   With respect indeed to any personal claims I have to prefer for occupying

60 distinguished a post, the most that could be alleged in my behalf is the

having from the commencement of this Association done what I could to pro-

mote its success, and to enlist others in  its service                                           persuaded, as I have  ever
                                                                                              ;

been, that it could not fail to prove a most efficient instrument for the further-

ance of scientific objects, not only through the direct influence of its Meetings

in promoting a friendly intercourse and a free interchange of opinions amongst

those devoted to kindred pursuits, but also indirectly, by engaging the Public

in various useful undertakings, which Science indeed might have suggested,

but which the Nation alone was capable of carrying into effect.

   And that these anticipations have been borne out by the result, would
now seem to be generally admitted from the fact, that other Societies, since

organized in this country with a view to similar objects, have been uniformly
framed after its model, and conducted upon principles which they have

borrowed from this Institution.
   It is indeed rather remarkable, that the first idea of an Association of such

a kind should have suggested itself only a year after death had deprived us of

--our three most distinguished philosophers, for who had we then left to com-

pare, with Davy for the brilliancy and importance of his discoveries; with
Young for the singular union of almost universal acquirements with ad-
mirable powers of invention ; and with Wollaston for an acuteness of mental
vision, which gave him the same advantage in the pursuits of science, which
the Naturalist armed with a microscope has over the unassisted observer?
Just as in the animal ceconomy the vis medicatrix naturce sometimes makes
an extraordinary effort to repair the damage inflicted by injury or disease
so it would seem, as if Science, conscious of the loss she had sustained in the

almost simultaneous extinction of her three brightest luminaries, endeavoured
to make good the deficiency, by concentrating into owe focus those that yet

remained, to light her onwards on her path.

   At any rate, the progress which the Natural Sciences have made since

that period, although doubtless attributable to several concurrent causes, is

a fact which must not be overlooked in estimating the services rendered
by this Association to the cause of human advancement ; nor can I in
any better manner point out its value, than by bringing before your notice
some of the additions to our knowledge which have been made since I last
addressed you, especially considering, that not a few of the discoveries to
which I shall allude were either first announced, or have been made the

subjects of discussion, at our several Meetings.

Beginning then with Chemistry, as the subject with which I am most

familiar, let me remind you, that at a period not much more remote than

the one alluded to, all of it that could be quoted as really worthy the name

of a Science was comprehended within the limits of the mineral kingdom.

1856.                                                                                            d

 I REPORT-^1856.

     Here at least the outline had been traced out with sufficient precision

--the general laws established on a tinn basis the nomenclature framed with
--logical exactness the facts consistent with each other, and presented in a

 scientific and luminous form. Thus a philosopher, liice Sir Humphry Davy,
 who had contributed in so eminent a degree to bring the science into this

 satisfactory condition, might, at the close of his career, have despaired of
 adding anything worthy of his name to the domain of chemistry, and have
 sighed for other worlds to subdue.

    But there was a World almost as little known to the chemists of that
 period as was the Western Hemisphere to the Macedonian Conqueror,
 one comprising an infinite variety of important products, called into exist-
 ence by the mysterious operation of the vital principle, and therefore placed,
 as was imagined, almost beyond the reach of experimental research.

     This is the new World of Chemistry, which the continental philosophers in
 the first instance, and subsequently those of our own country, have during the
 last twenty years been busy in exploring, and by so doing have not only
 bridged over tlie gulf which had before s-eparated by an impassable barrier
 the kingdoms of inorganic and of organic nature, but also have added pro-
 vinces as extensive and as fertile as tliose we were in possession of before, to
 the patrimony of Science.

     It is indeed singular, that whilst the supposed elements of mineral bodies
are very numerous, the combinations between them should be comparatively
few ; whereas amongst those of vegetable and animal origin, where the ulti-
mate elements are so limited in point of number, the combinations which
they form appear almost infinite. Carbon and hydrogen, for instance, con-
stitute, as it were, the keystone of every organic fabric ; whilst oxygen, nitro-
gen, and less frequently sulphur and phosphorus, serve almost alone to build
up their superstructure.

   And yet what an infinity of products is brought about by ringing the

changes upon this scanty alpliabet ! Even one series of bodies alone, that
known by the name of the Fatty Acids, comprises several hundred well-
ascertained combinations, founded however upon a single class of hydro-
carbons or compound radicals, in which the carbon and hydrogen stand to
each other in equal atomic proportions, and are in each case acidified by
the same number of equivalents of oxygen.

    These acids are all monobasic, or combine with only one proportion of
base; but add to any one of them two equivalents of carbonic acid, and
you obtain a member of a second series, which is bibasic, or is capable of
forming two classes of salts.

    The above therefore constitute a double series, as it were, of organic acids,
the members of which are mutually related in the manner pointed out, and
diflfer from each other in their mode of combining according to the relation
between their respective elements. But already, by the labours of Hofmann
and of other chemists, two other double series ot acids, the one monobasic
the other bibasic, mutually related exactly in the same manner as those above,
have been brouglit to light ; each series no doubt characterized by an equally
numerous appendage of alcohols, of aethers, and of aldehydes, to say nothing
of the secondary compounds resulting from the union of each of these bodies

Avith others.

   Hence the more insight we obtain into the chemistry of organic substances,
the more we become bewildered with their complexity, and in investigating
these phaenomena, find ourselves in the condition of the explorer of a new
continent, who, although he might see the same sun over his head, the
same ocean rolling, at his feet, the same geological structure in the rocks
ADDRESS.  11

 that were piled around him, and was thus assured that he still continued a
 denizen of his own planet, and subject to those physical laws to which he
 had been before amenable, yet at every step he took was met by some
 novel object, and startled with some strange and portentous production of

 Nature's fecundity.

    Even so the chemist of the present day, whilst he recognizes in the world
 of organic life the same general laws which prevail throughout the mineral
kingdom, is nevertlieless astonished and perplexed by the multiplicity of new
bodies that present themselves, the wondrous changes in them resulting from
slight differences in molecular arrangement, and tlie simple nature of the
machinery by which such complicated eifects are brought about.

   And as the New World might never have been discovered, or, at all events,

would not have been brought under our subjection, without those improve-
ments in naval architecture which liad taken place prior to the age of
Columbus, so the secrets of organic chemistry would have long remained
unelicited, but for the facilities in the methods of analysis which were

introduced by Liebig.
    Before his time the determination of tlie component elements of an organic

substance was a task of so much skill as well as labour, that only the most

--accomplished analysts such men, for instance, as my lamented friend Dr.

--Prout in this country, or as the great Berzelius in Sweden could be de-

pended upon for such a work ; and hence the data upon which we could rely
for deducing any general conclusions went on accumulating with extreme

slowness.

    But the new methods of analysis invented by Liebig have so simplified
and so facilitated the processes, that a student, after a few months' practical
instruction in a laboratory, can, in many instances, arrive at results sufficiently
precise to be made the basis of calculation, and thus to enable the master
mind, which is capable of availing itself of the facts before it, to breathe life

--into these dry numerical details, ^^just as the sculptor, by a few finishing

strokes, brings out the expression of the statue, which has been prepared for
him by the laborious chiseling of a number of subordinate workmen.

   And as the established laws and institutions of the Old World have been

-- --modified may I not say in some instances rectified? by the insensible influ-

ence of those of the New, so have the principles that had been deduced from
the phaenomena of the mineral kingdom undergone in many instances a cor-
rection from the new discoveries made in the chemistry of the animal and

vegetable creation.

   It was a great step indeed in the progress of the Science, when Lavoisier

set the example of an appeal to the balance in all our experimental re-

searches, and the Atomic Theory of Dalton may be regarded as the necessary,

although somewhat tardy, result of the greater numerical precision thus in-

troduced.

   But no less important was the advance achieved, when structure and
polarity were recognized as influencing the condition of matter, and when
the nature of abodyVas felt to be determined, not only by the proportions of
its component elements, but also by their mutual arrangement and colloca-

--tion a principle, which, first illustrated amongst the products of organic

life, has since been found to extend alike to all chemical substances what-

soever.

   Formerly it had been the rule to set down the bodies which form the con-
stituents of the substances we analysed, and which had never yet under our
hands undergone decomposition, as elementary ; but the discovery of
cyanogen in the first instance, and the recognition of several other com-

                                                                      d2

pound radicals in organic chemistry more lately, naturally suggest the idea,
that many of the so-called elements of inorganic matter may likewise be
compounds, differing from the organic radicals above mentioned merely in

their constituents being bound together by a closer affinity.

   And this conjecture is confirmed by the curious numerical relations sub-

sisting between the atomic weights of several of these supposed elements
as, for example, between chlorine, bromine and iodine ; an extension of the
grand generalization of Dalton, which, although it was unforeseen by the
Founder of the system, and therefore, like Gay-Lussac's theory of volumes,
raio-ht very possibly have been repudiated by him, had it been proposed tor
his\cceptance, will be regarded by others as establishing, in a manner more

conclusive than before, the soundness of his antecedent deductions.
What, indeed, can be a greater triumph for the theorist, than to hnd that
                                                                         by a long  and
a law of nature which he has had the    glory of establishing           to all the  new
painful process of induction, not only
                                        accommodates itself

facts which the progress of     discovery has since brought to light, but is itselt
the consequence of a still     more general and comprehensive pnncip e, which

philosophers, even at this distance of time, are still engaged ;n unfolding ;-
   It is also curious to reflect, that whilst the bold speculations of Democntus
have been realized by the Manchester philosopher, the reveries of the
alchemists derive something like solid support from the minute investigations

Ol Ills SLlCCGSSOVS*

  We may remark indeed as not a little remarkable, how frequently the

discoveries of modern days have served to redeem the fancies of medieval

times from the charge      of absurdity.            near  the  earth    can,  as   rG-enerali
    If the direction of a  bit of steel suspended

Sabine has proved, be influenced by the position of a body like the moon,
situated at a distance from it of more than 200,000 miles, who shall say that
there was anything preposterously extravagant in the conception, however
little support it may derive from experience, that the stars might exert an
influence over the destinies of man 1 and when we observe a series of bodies,
exhibiting, as it would seem, a gradation of properties, and, although as yet
undecompounded, possessing a common numerical relation one to the other,
who will deny the probability, that they are composed of the same consti-
tuents, however little approach we may have as yet made towards the art ot
resolving them into their elements, or of forming them anew ?

    Organic chemistry has also considerably modified our views with respect

to  chemical affinity.                                    support, ed,  ofr  i^    wi-t^hu  con-
    According to one
                        view,  indeed,  which  has  been                     late

siderable talent and ingenuity, the law of elective attraction, to which we
ha-e been in the habit of referring all the changes that are brought about
by chemical means, is a mere figment of the imagination ; and decomposition
may be accounted for, without the interference of any such force, by re-
garding it simply as the result of that constant interchange which is supposed
to be Soing on between the particles of matter --the atoms even of a solid
body being, according to this hypothesis, in a state of intessant motion.
    But passing over these and other speculations which have not as yet re-
ceived the general assent of chemists, let me advert to others of an older date,

possessing, as I conceive, the strongest internal evidence in their favour, which
the case admits, from the harmony they tend to introduce into the chaos ot
facts which the late discoveries in organic chemistry have brought to light.
   Amongst these, one of the most generally received, and at the same time
one of the most universal application, is that which represents the several
combinations resulting from organic forces, as being put together according
                                                                               ;

                               ADDRES8.                                  liii

to a particular model or type, which impresses upon the aggregate formed
certain common properties, and also causes it to undergo change most

readily, through the substitution of some other element in the place of one of

those which already enters into its constitution.

   And this principle, having been established with regard to one class of
bodies, has since been extended to the rest; for it now begins to be main-

tained, that in every case of chemical decomposition a new element is intro-

duced in the place of one of those which constituted a part of the original

compound, so that the addition of a fresh ingredient is necessarily accom-

panied by the elimination of an old one.

The same doctrine, too, has even been extended to the case of combination

with a body regarded as elementary, for here also the particles are considered

as being in a state of binary combination one with the other, owing perhaps

to their existing in opposite electrical conditions, and therefore possessing for

each other a certain degree of chemical affinity.

Thus, when we unite hydrogen with oxygen, we substitute an atom of the

latter for one of the former, previously combined with the same element.

The type therefore remains, although the constituents are different.

When, in the formation of alcohol, we combine the oxide of the compound

radical sethyle with water, there is still only a substitution of the former for

one of the atoms of water previously united together, two and two ; and
when we form aether, we eliminate the second atom of water, and replace it

by another atom of the same compound radical. Thus the type of water

still remains, although none of the materials of the original fabric continue

or, if I may adopt the metaphor of a building, although the original bricks

which composed the structure may have been all replaced by other materials,

the latter, however ditfering in their nature, always correspond, in point of

shape, dimensions, and number, with the parts of the edifice which have been

removed to make way for them.

It is on this principle that Professor Williamson has propounded a new

theory of aetherification, regarding the process as resulting from the alternate

--replacement of hydrogen by sethyle, and of sethyle by hydrogen, in the

sulphuric acid concerned, a view, which best harmonises with the composi-

tion of the new aether he hit upon in the course of his investigations.

   The same principle may even be extended to bodies of the same type as
ammonia ; for inasmuch as this body is made up of a union of an atom of

nitrogen with three of hydrogen, it is easy to conceive that a variety of
different compounds might be formed by the substitution of one, two, or three

atoms of other radicals for the same number of atoms of the original

Howhydrogen.  beautifully this idea has been carried out in the recent

researches of Hofmann, and how happily it serves to elucidate the formation

of the various vegetable alkaloids, which, from their energetic action upon
the animal ceconomy, have of late excited so much interest in the public
mind, is sufficiently known to those who are chemists, and could not be
rendered intelligible to those who are not, without entering into details which
would be out of place on the present occasion.

I must not, however, pass over this part of the subject without remarking,

that the adoption of Professor Williamson's othyle theory would establish a
still nearer analogy between the constitution of organic and of mineral com-
pounds than is at present recognized, since in that case alcohol and aether
would stand in the same relation one to the other, and belong to the same

class or series, as the acids and their salts.

   These views, however, and others having reference to the same subject,
are now under discussion, and I hope in progress of being worked out bj
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

--IlV REPORT 1856.

the able chemist above alluded to, whose promised Report on this subject,
had it been ready for this Meeting, would have superseded the necessity of
the above Remarks. They have also engaged the attention of ray distin-
guisiied successor in the chair of Chemistry at Oxford, who has published
some elaborate researches bearing upon the questions here mooted, whilst on
the Continent they have been taken up by several of the most eminent
chemists of tlie day, sucii as Gerhardt, VVurtz, and Cahours.

    Should they ultimately win their way to general reception, they must tend
to bring about an entire remodeling of our views, both with respect to
organic and inorganic compounds, and render that reform in our nomen-
clature which I pressed upon the attention of the Chemical Section at our
meeting in Ipswich, more than ever a matter of urgent necessity.

   Many, however, perhaps of my present audience may not have advanced be-

yond that initial stage of all speculation, which contemplates external objects
solely as they affect themselves, and not abstractedly in their relations to
each other ; and to such it may be more interesting to consider those
practical results bearing upon the arts of life, which have either been actually
deduced, or may be anticipated as likely to accrue, from the discoveries in

question.

   Of these perhaps the most important is the possibility of forming by art

those compounds, which had been formerly supposed to be only producible
by natural processes, under the influence of the vital principle. The last
two years have added materially to the catalogue of such bodies artificially
produced, as in the formation of several species of alcohol from coal gas by
Berthelot, that of oil of mustard by the same chemist, and the generation of
taurine, a principle elaborated in the liver, by Strecker.

   And if the above discoveries should strike you at first sight rather as

curious than practically useful, I would remark, that they afford reasonable
ground for hope, that the production of some of those principles of high
medicinal or ceconomical value, which nature has sparingly provided, or at
least limited to certain districts or climates, may lie within the compass of
the chemist's skill.

    If Quinine, for instance, to which the Peruvian bark owes its efficacy, be,
as would appear from recent researches, a modified condition of ammonia,

why may not a Hofmann be able to produce it for- us from its elements, as
he has already done so many other alkaloids of similar constitution ?

   And thus, whilst the progress of civilization, and the development of the

chemical arts, are accelerating the consumption of those articles, which
kind Nature has either been storing up for the uses of man during a vast
succession of antecedent ages, or else is at present elaborating for us in that
limited area, within which alone the conditions would seem to be such as to

admit of their production, we are encouraged to hope that Science may
make good the loss she has contributed to create, by herself inventing arti-
ficial modes of obtaining these necessary materials.

   In this case we need not so much regard the exhaustion of our collieries,
although Nature appears to have provided no means for replenishing them

nor even be concerned at the rapid destruction of the trees which yield the
Peruvian bark, limited though they be to a very narrow zone, and to a
certain definite elevation on either side of the equator.

    Already, indeed, chemistry has given token of her powers, by threatening

to alter the coui'seof commerce, and to reverse the tide of human industry.
   Thus she has discovered, it is said, a substitute for the cochineal insect,

in a beautiful dye producible from guano.
ADDRESS.  Iv

    She has shown, that our supply of animal food might be obtained at a
cheaper rate from the Antipodes, by simply boiling down the juices of the
flesh of cattle now wasted and thrown aside in those countries, and importing

the extract in a state of concentration.
    She has pointed out, that one of the earths which constitute the principal

material of our globe contains a metal, as light as glass, as malleable and
ductile as copper, and as little liable to rust as silver ; thus possessing pro-
perties so valuable, that when means have been found of separating it ceco-
nomically from its ore, it will be capable of superseding the metals in coin-

mon use, and thus of rendering metallurgy an employment, not of certain

districts only, but of every part of the earth to which Science and Civilization

have penetrated.

   And may I not also say, that she has contributed materially towards the

advancement of those arts in which an agricultural county like this is espe-

cially interested ?

  Who has not heard of the work of Baron Liebig, which, at the time of its

first appearance, made such a sensation throughout the country ; and stirred
up the dormant energies oi' the agricultural public, not less thoroughly, than
the subsoil plough, of which he explained the advantages, elicited the latent

treasures of the land ?
   It is not often that the same individual has reaped a high reputation, at

once by establishing general principles in Science, and by rendering popular

their application to practice.

   Oersted, the father of the science of Electro-chemistry, and our own
Faraday, who has done so much to develope its principles, left to Wheatstone
the invention of the telegraph ; Dalton, the propounder of the Atomic Theory,

did nothing to improve the manufactures of the city in which he resided;
and the contrivances which have rendered the steam-engine generally appli-
cable to practice required a combination of tlie distinct talents of a Black
and a Watt, the one to explain the theory of latent heat, the other to apply

it to the ceconomical generation of steam.
   But Baron Liebig stands equally distinguished for his ingenuity in de-

vising new methods of analysis, for his originality in propounding great
theoretical principles in Science, and for his happy talent in applying these

principles to purposes of practical utility.
   Like his countryman Goethe, his mind seems to have passed through

three phases ; for his ingenious methods of analysis were appreciated, before
his views on the relation between organic substances, his doctrine of com-
pound radicals, and the consequences flowing from his researches in vege-
table chemistry, came to be generally admitted ; and the latter had already
taken root in the minds of chemists, and had established for him a very high
reputation among his fellow-labourers in Science, before his attempts to
apply his principles to agriculture and to physiology made his name so

celebrated, as it has since been, amongst the public in general.
   It is well known, that a controversy has been going on for some time past

between this distinguished foreigner, and certain experimental agriculturists
of our own country, with regard to the principles upon which the manuring
of our land ought to be regulated. In this dispute, however, you will not

expect me to take part ; for it would be obviously improper on the present

occasion, that I should avail myself of a little brief authority to influence the
public on either side of a much-debated question; and, indeed, on any other,
it might be deemed an act of presumption in an individual, <rho can prefer
no claim either to the extensive practical experience of the one, or to the high

scientific eminence of the other, to take upon himself to adjudicate between
two such conflicting parties.
--Ivi REPORT 1856.

   But I may be permitted to remark, that whilst some points of difference
between them still remain open for further investigation, a much nearer

correspondence of opinion exists with respect to others, than the public in
general, or even perhaps the disputants themselves, are inclined to allow.

    In so far, indeed, as concerns the relative advantages of mineral and
ammoniacal manures, I presume there is little room for controversy ; for
although most soils may contain a sufficiency of the inorganic constituents
required by the crop, it by no means follows that the latter are always in an
available condition; and hence it may well happen that in most cases in
which land has been long under cultivation, the former class of manures

becomes, as Baron Liebig asserts, a matter of paramount necessity. Now

that the same necessity exists for the addition of ammoniacal manures can
liardly be contended, when we reflect, that at the first commencement of
vegetable life, every existing species of plant must have obtained its nourish-
ment, solely from the gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, and from the
mineral contents of the rock in which it vegetated.

   The only divergence of opinion therefore that can arise, relates to the
degree of their respective utility in the existing state of our agriculture, and
to the soundness of Baron I,iebig's position, that a plant rooted in a soil well-
charged with all the requisite mineral ingredients, and in all other respects
in a condition calculated to allow of healthy vegetation, may sooner or later
be able to draw from the atmosphere whatever else is required for its full

development.

   And does not, I would ask, this latter position derive some support from

the luxuriant vegetation of the tropics, where art certainly contributes nothing
towards the result? and is it not also favoured by such experiments as those

carried on at Lois Weedon in Northamptonshire, where the most luxuriant
wheat crops have been obtained for a number of consecutive years without
manure of any kind, simply by following out the TuUian system of stirring
up and pulverizing the soil ?

   How, too, are we to explain that capacity of subsisting without any artificial
supply of ammonia, which IMr. Lawes is led by his experiments to attribute
to turnips, and other plants of similar organization, unless we assume that
the power residing in the leaves of absorbing ammonia from the air may
render plants, in some cases at least, independent of any extraneous aid ?

    Be this, however, as it may, there is at least a wide distinction between
this opinion, and the one attributed to Baron Liebig by many, who would
seem to imagine, that according to his views, ammonia, if derived from arti-
ficial sources, was in a manner useless to vegetation.

    As if it could be a matter of any moment, whether the substance which

in both cases afforded the supply of nitrogen, and which in both cases also
was primarily derived from the decomposition of organic substances, had
been assimilated by plants directly upon its being thus generated, or had
been received into their system at a later period, after having been diffused

through the atmosphere 1 To suppose that Baron Liebig should have attached
any moment to this distinction seems inconsistent with many passages in
his work, in which, although the paramount importance of mineral manures
may be insisted upon, and the success which had in certain cases attended
the use of one compounded only of mineral ingredients may be put forward

as a motive for further trials, the utility of ammoniacal substances in all their
several forms is at the same time distinctly admitted.

     Still the practical question remains, whether, admitting the theoretical
truth of Baron Liebig's position, a larger expenditure of capital will not be

required for bringing a given farm into a condition to dispense with ammo-
niacal manures, than for procuring those materials which contain that ingre-
ADDRESS.  Ivii

dient ready for use. And here experimental researches, such as those con-

ducted on so extended and liberal a scale by Mr. Lawes and Dr. Gilbert,
come in aid of theory. They stand, as it were, midway between the abstract
principles which Science points out to the farmer, and the traditional usages
with respect to his art, which have been handed down to him from one gene-
ration to another. They bear the same relation to the farmer, which the
records of the clinical practice in a large in6rmary do, to the general princi-
ples of medicine expounded by the modern physiologist.

   It is true, that the experience of a particular hospital may not at all times

coincide with the anticipations which science holds out; but this discrepancy
only suggests to us the imperfection of our present knowledge, and is not

allowed to disturb the confidence of the physician in principles already esta-

blished on incontrovertible evidence. On the contrary, whilst he modifies

his practice from time to time by the experience he has gained by actual ob-
servation, he feels at the same time the fullest conviction, that these results
will be found eventually reconcileable with the general principles, which a

still more extended series of induction may have established.
   I need not occupy your time by applying the same method of proceeding

to the recent researches alluded to, but I will carry the analogy between the

science of Agriculture and of Therapeutics one step further. You may recol-
lect, that in a Report on the progress of husbandry, drawn up some years ago
by one of the most enlightened and zealous promoters of the agricultural

interest in Great Britain, now, alas I deceased, it was asserted, that chemistry
had done nothing for the farmer, except in teaching him to use sulphuric
acid with his bones, and to take advantage of the refuse flax liquor, formerly
thrown away and wasted.

   Now a statement of this kind, although it might be literally true in the

narrow sense in which the author doubtless intended it, namely, as referring
merely to the introduction of new specifics or recipes into farming, was
calculated, when put forth on such high authority, to foster that tendency in
the human mind to which we are all more or less prone, that of sparing our-
selves the trouble of thought and reflection in shaping the course of our con-
duct, by leaning blindly upon certain rigid and unvarying rules alreadj--
chalked out to us by others.

   It was this propensity exercised upon moral subjects which has encumbered
our libraries with those vast tomes on casuistry, in which the conduct to be
pursued in each imaginable casie of conscience was attempted to be pre-
scribed; it was this which has driven many a patient to fly from the regular
practitioner into the arms of the homoeopathist, who professes to have a glo-
bule ready to meet every possible symptom.

    Grant that Science has as yet supplied us with only two infallible receipts
for the improvement of our land, the agricultural chemist may derive courage
from the reflection, that medicine too, since the days of Hippocrates, has
lighted only upon two or three specifics for the cure of disease ; and that the
most enlightened physicians of the present day, in the spirit which we would
fain see actuating the leaders of the agricultural body, depend not upon the
efficacy o^ nostrums, but upon their sagacity in referring the varying condi-
tions of each case which comes before them to those principles of physiology
which modern Science has established.

   And has not Science also unfolded principles which may be called in to

aid and direct the practical labours of the agriculturist ?
   I need not go further than the works of Baron Liebig for an answer to

this question. I may appeal, for instance, to the extensive employment of
guano at the present time, first introduced in England in consequence of his
                                                                                                            ;

Iviii                                                              --REPORT 1856.

suggestions : I may refer to the substitution of mineral phosphates for bones,

founded upon his explanation of the sources from which the latter substance
derives its efficacy as a manure : and 1 may allude more especially to his
refutation of the humus theory, to which even the great Saussure gave his

adhesion, and the reception of which was calculated to vitiate, not a few pro-

cesses only, but the entire system of our husbandry.

But whilst we do justice to those comprehensive views on agricultural

science which have shed a new lustre upon the name of Liebig, let us not

forget the practical researches which have been carried on in our own

country                                     and  especially those  conducted  under  the  auspices  of the  Highland
                                         ;

Society by Dr. Anderson ; at our own Agricultural College by Prof. Voelcker;

and, through the aid of the lloyal Agricultural Society, by their consulting

chemist, Mr. Way. And, although in alluding to the labours of the latter, we

may be bound to confess, that in one of the latest and probably the most

important investigations undertaken by him, that namely on the absorptive

qualities of clay with reference to ammouiacal salts, he had been anticipated,
so far as the principle goes, by the German Professor, who announced the

fact many years before in his work ' On Chemistry applied to Agriculture*,'
yet experience has often shown that a principle may lie dormant long after

it was enunciated, until its truth is rendered palpable to the senses by a

series of practical researches expressly directed with a view to demonstrate

its general applicability.

Baron Liebig has himself remarked, that as a plant, in order to thrive,

must receive its i'ood, not in a concentrated form, but reduced to a certain

state of tenuity by being diffused through water; so an abstract truth only
makes an impression upon the mind and feelings, when presented to it

properly diluted, turned, as it were, inside out, examined under every

aspect, and decked out with all the accompaniments of dress, ornament, and

colour.

   Then, indeed, as the seed, when implanted in the ground and taken root,

is able to cleave asunder the hardest rocks, and that, as the ohl proverb says,
all without noise ; so likewise the truth will at length in its own good time

begin to germinate, and gradually conquering all obstacles, establish lor itself
a footing in the mind of the public. Let us not therefore withhold our meed
of approbation from those who have worked out for us any useful scientific
principle, even though the germ may be traceable to some other quarter

conscious that it is to its being brought thus prominently forward, and, as
it were, forced upon the attention of the public, that we owe its general

reception and its reduction to practice.

    But it is time to hasten on to certain other departments of Natural Science.
   In Botany and Vegetable Physiology it cannot perhaps be said, that whole
provinces have been added to the domain of the Science since the period
alluded to, as we have seen to be the case in our review of the progress of

chemistry.

   Even so long ago as the year 18S2, the elder DeCandolle, who, if not the
most original or the most profound of the botanists of his day, was at least
the most conspicuous for the wide range of his information, and for his
happy talent of imparting it to others, published that admirable work on
vegetable physiology, which even at the present time is capable of serving
as a most useful guide in many branches of the subject.

   And yet what a mass of important information has been brought together

since that period I
                                                         * P. 57, Eng. Trans.
ADDRESS.  lix

   The improvements in the microscope which have since taken place, render
us familiar with particulars relating to the structure and functions of the
vegetable creation, which the ruder methods of investigation before resorted

to would never have revealed to us.

  We owe to them the interesting discoveries of Brown and Adolphe Brong-

niart, as to the mode in which the pollen is brought into immediate contact
with the ovules, by means of the tubes which it protrudes by a prolongation
of the innermost of its two investing membranes. Thus much at least appears
to be fully ascertained ; but in alluding to the observations of others who
have endeavoured to push their scrutiny still further, it becomes me to speak
with more diffidence, inasmuch as the office which the pollen discharges in
the act of fecundation is still a matter of dispute, between such men as
Schleiden and Schacht on the one side, and Hofmeister, Moll, &c. on the other.

    Whilst, however, this controversy continues, it is something at least to

know, that the vivifying principle, whatever it may be, is actually transmitted

to the part where its influence is to be exerted, and not kept apart from it,
as we were formerly compelled to assume, by that long intervening plexus
of fibres or tubes which constitutes the style.

. To the microscope also we owe all that is as yet known with respect to the
reproductive process in cryptogamous plants, which are now shown to possess

a structure analogous to that of flowering ones in respect to their organs of

reproduction ; not, indeed, as Hedwig supposed, that parts corresponding to
stamens and pistils in appearance and structure can be discovered in them,

but that, as the primary distinction of sexes seems to run throughout the

vegetable kingdom, new parts are superadded to a structure common to all
as we ascend in the scale of creation, until from the simple cell, which, in
consequence of some differences of structure to our eyes inappreciable, ap-

pears to exercise in one case the function of the male, in another of the female,
as is found the case in certain of the Confervse, we arrive at length at the com-
plicated machinery exhibited in flowering plants, in which the cell containing
the fecundating principle is first matured in the stamen, and afterwards trans-

mitted through an elaborate apparatus to the cells of the ovule, which is in
like manner enveloped in its matrix, and protected by the series of investing
membranes which constitutes the seed-veissel. Thus, as Goethe long ago
observed, and as modern Physiologists have since shown to be the case, the

--more imperfect a being is, the more its individual parts resemble each other
    the progress of development, both in the animal and vegetable kingdom,
always proceeding from the like to the unlike, from the general to the

particular.

   But whilst the researches of Brown and others have proved, that there is no
abrupt line of division in the vegetable kingdom, and that one common struc-
ture pervades the whole ; the later inquiries of Suminski, Hofmeister, Unger,
Griffith, and Henfrey, have pointed out several curious and unlooked-for
analogies between plants and animals.

   I may mention, in the first place, as an instance of this analogy, the ex-
istence of moving molecules or phytosperms in the antheridia of Ferns and
other Cryptogams, borne out, as it has been in so remarkable a manner, by

the almost simultaneous observations of BischofF and Meissner on the egg,
confirmatory of those formerly announced by Barry and Newport; and by
the researches of Suminski, Thuret, and Pringsheim, With respect to the
ovule of plants. I may refer you also to a paper read at the last Meeting of
the Association, by Dr. Cohn of Breslau, who, in bringing tliis subject before
the Natural History Section, adduced instances of a distinction of sexes which
had come under his observation in the lower Algse.
--Ix REPORT 1856.

    In like manner a curious correspondence has been traced between the
lower tribes of animals and plants, in the circumstance of both being subject
to the law of what is called alternate generation. This consists in a sort of
cycle of changes from one kind of being to another, which was first detected
in some of the lower tribes of animals, a pair of insects, for example, producing
a progeny differing from themselves in outward appearance and internal
structure, and these reproducing their kind without any renewed sexual union,
the progeny in these cases consisting of females only. At length, after a
succession of such generations, the offspring reverts to its primaeval type, and
pairs of male and female insects of the original form are reproduced, which
complete the cycle, by giving rise in their turn to a breed presenting the
same characters as those which belong to their own progenitors.

   An ingenious comparison had been instituted by Owen and others between

this alternation of generations in the animal, and the alternate production of
leaves and blossoms in the plant; but the researches to which 1 especially
allude have rendered this no longer a matter of mere speculation or inference,
inasmuch as they have shown the same thing to occur in Ferns, in Lyco-
podia, in Mosses, nay, even in the Confervas.

  We are indebted to Professor Henfrey for a valuable contribution to our

Transactions in 1851 on these subjects, given in the form of a Report on
the Higher Cryptogamous Plants ; from which it at least appears, that the
proofs of sexuality in the Cryptogamia rank in the same scale as to com-
pleteness, as those regarding flowering plants did before the access of the
pollen tubes to the ovule had been demonstrated. Indeed, if the observations
of Pringsheim with respect to certain of the Algae are to be relied upon,
the analogy between tiie reproductive process in plants and animals is even
more clearly made out in these lower tribes, than it is in those of higher

organization.

   It also appears, that the production in Ferns and other Acrogens of
what has been called a pro-embryo ; the evolution of antheridia and arche-
gonia, or of male and female organs, from the former; and the generation
from the archegonia of a frond bearing spores upon its under surface, is
analogous to what takes place in flowering plants in general ; where the seed,
when it germinates, produces stem, roots and leaves ; the stem for many gene-
rations gives rise to nothing but shoots like itself; until at length a flower
springs from it, which contains within itself for the most part the organs of
both sexes united, and therefore occasions the reproduction of the same seed
with which the chain of phsenomena commenced. This is the principle
which a learned Professor at Berlin has rather obscurely shadowed out in

his Treatise on the Rejuvenescence of Plants, and which may perhaps be re-

garded as one at least of the means, by which Nature provides for the stabi-
lity of the forms of organic life she has created, by imparting to each plant a
tendency to revert to the primaeval type.

   To the elder DeCandoUe we are also indebted for some of our most philo-

sophical views with respect to the laws which regulate the distribution of

--plants over the globe, yiews which have been developed and extended, but

by no means subverted, by the investigations of subsequent writers ; amongst

whom Sir Charles Lyell, in his ' Principles of Geology,' and the younger

DeCandolle, a worthy inheritor of his father's reputation, in his recently
published work on Botanical Geography, have especially signalized them-
selves. But it is to the late Professor Edward Forbes, and to Dr. Joseph
Hooker, that we have principally to attribute the removal of those anomalies,
which threw a certain degree of doubt upon the principles laid down by
ADDRESS.  ixi

DeCandolle in 1820, in his celebrated article on the Geography of Plants,
contained in the ' Dictionnaire des Sciences Naturelles,' where the derivation
of each species from an individual, or a pair of individuals, created in one
particular locality, was made the starting-point of all our inquiries.

    These anomalies were of two different kinds, and pointed in two opposite
directions: for we had in some cases to explain the occurrence of a peculiar
flora in islands cut off from the rest of the world, except through the medium
of a wide intervening ocean ; and in other cases to reconcile the fact of the
same or of allied species being diffused over vast areas, the several portions of
which are at the present time separated from each other in such a manner, as
to prevent the possibility of the migration of plants from one to the other.
Indeed, after making due allowances for those curious contrivances by which
Nature has in many instances provided for the transmission of species
over different parts of the same continent, and even across the ocean, and
which are so well pointed out in DeCandoUe's original essay, we are com-
pelled to admit the apparent inefficiency of existing causes to account for the
distribution of the larger number of species ; and must confess that the
explanation fails us often where it is most needed ; for the Compositae, in
spite of those feathery appendages they possess, which are so favourable to
the wide dissemination of their seeds, might be inferred, by their general
 absence from the fossil flora, to have diffused themselves in a less degree than

many other families have done. And on the other hand, it is found, that

 under existing circumstances, those Composite, which are disseminated
 throughout the area of the Great Pacific, belong in many cases to species

 destitute of these auxiliaries to transmission.

     But here Geology comes to our aid ; for by pointing out the probability of

 the submergence of continents on the one hand, and the elevation of tracts
 of land on the other, it enables us to explain, the occurrence of the same
 plants in some islands or continents now wholly unconnected, and the exist-

 ence of a distinct flora in others too isolated to obtain it under present cir-

 cumstances from without. In the one case we may suppose the plants to
 have been distributed over the whole area before its several parts became
 disunited by the catastrophes which supervened ; in the other, we may re-
 gard the peculiar flora now existing as merely the wreck, as it were, of one

 which once overspread a large tract of land, of which all but the little patch
 upon which it is now found had since been submerged.

    Upon this subject, however, our opinions may in some measure be swayed
 by the nature of the conclusions we arrive at with respect to the length of

 time during which seeds are capable of maintaining their vitality ; for if after
 remaining for an indefinite period in the earth they were capable of germi-
 nating, it would doubtless be easier to understand the revival, under favour-

 able circumstances, of plants which had existed before the severance of a

 tract of land from the continent in which they are indigenous. An inquiry

 has accordingly been carried on for the last fifteen years under the auspices of,
 and with the aid of funds supplied by, this Association, the results of which,
 it is but fair to say, by no means corroborate the reports that had been
 from time to time given us with respect to the extreme longevity of certain

 seeds, exemplified, as it was said, in the case of the mummy-wheat and other
 somewhat dubious instances ; inasmuch as they tend to show, that none of
  the seeds which were tested, although they had been placed under the most
  favourable artificial conditions that could be devised, vegetated beyond a

  period of forty-nine years ; that only twenty out of 288 species did so after
  twenty years ; whilst by far the larger number had lost their germinating

  power in the course of ten.
--Ixii REPORT 1856.

    These results, indeed, being merely negative, ought not to outweigh such
positive statements on the contrary side as come before us recommended by
respectable authority, such, for instance, as that respecting a Nelumbium
seed, which germinated after having been preserved in Sir Hans Sloane's
Herbarium for 150 years; still, however, they throw suspicion as to the
existence in seeds of that capacity of preserving their vitality almost indefi-
nitely} which alone would warrant us in calling to our aid this principle in
explaining the wide geographical range which certain species of plants affect.

    Let us then be content to appeal to those ingenious views which were first
put forth at one of our meetings by the late Professor Forbes, and which
have since been promulgated in a more detailed and systematic form by the
same distinguished naturalist. By the aid of the principles therein laid down,
he was enabled to trace the flora of Great Britain principally to four distinct
sources, owing to the geological connexion of these islands at one period or

other with Scandinavia, with Germany, with France, and with Spain ! And
it was by a similar assumption that Dr. Joseph Hooker explained the dis-

tribution of the same species throughout the islands of the Great Pacific,
and the contiguous continents, tracts which, as Darwiii had shown, were
formerly united. Nor is this mode of explanation limited to the case of the
above regions ; for in the ' Flora Indica,' which important work I regret to find
has been suspended after the appearance of the first volume. Dr. Hooker, in
conjunction with his fellow traveller. Dr. Thomson, has discussed the same
problem with regard to the whole of India, extending from AfTghanistan to
the Malayan peninsula.

   And amongst the many services rendered to the Natural Sciences by these

indefatigable botanists, one of the greatest 1 conceive to be, that they have
not only protested against that undue multiplication of species, which had
taken place by exalting minute points of diflPerence into grounds of radical
and primary distinction, but that they have also practically illustrated their
views with respect to the natural families which have been described by
them in the volume alluded to. They have thus contributed materially to

--remove another difficulty which stood in the way of the adoption of the

theory of specific centres, I mean the replacement of forms of vegetation in
adjoining countries by others, not identical, but only us it should seem allied ;
for it follows from the principles laid down by these authors, that such ap-
parently distinct species may after all have been only varieties, produced by
the operation of external causes acting upon the same species during long

periods of time.

   But if this be allowed, what limits, it may be asked, are we to assign to
the changes which a plant is capable of undergoing, and in what way can we
oppose the principle of the transmutation of species, which has of late ex-
cited so much attention, and the admission of which is considered to involve

such startling consequences?
    I must refer you to the writings of modern physiologists for a full discus-

sion of this question, and may appeal in particular to the lecture delivered
before this Association by Dr. Carpenter at our last meeting. All that I

shall venture to remark on the subject is, that had not Nature herself assigned
certain boundaries to the changes which plants are capable of undergoing,
there would seem no reason why any species at all should he restricted within
a definite area, since the unlimited power of adaptation to external conditions
which it would then possess might enable it to diffuse itself throughout the
world, as easily as it has done over that portion of space within which it is

actually circumscribed.
--

    ADDRESS.  bciii

    Dr. Hooker Instances certain species of Coprosma, of Celmisia, and a kind
 of Australian Fern, the Lomaria procera, which have undergone such striking
 changes in their passage from one portion of the Great Pacific to another,
 that they are scarcely recognizable as the same, and have actually been re-
 garded by preceding botanists as distinct species. But he does not state
 that any of these plants have ever been seen beyond the above-mentioned
 precincts ; and yet if Nature had not imposed some limits to their suscepti-
bility of change, one does not see why they might not have spread over a
much lai^er portion of the earth, in a form more or less modified by external

 circumstances.

    The younger DeCandolle, in his late admirable treatise already referred
 to, has enumerated about 117 species of plants which have been thus dif-

 fused over at least a third of the surface of the globe ; but these apparently

 owed their power of transmigration to their insusceptibility of change, for
it does not appear that they have been much modified by the effect of climate
 or locality, notwithstanding the extreme difference in the external conditions
 to which they were subjected.

   On the other hand, it seems to be a general law, that plants, whose organi-

 zation is more easily affected by external agencies, become, from that very
cause, more circumscribed in their range of distribution ; simply because a
greater difference in the circumstances under which they would be placed
 brought with it an amount of change in their structure, which exceeded the
limits prescribed to it by Nature.

    In short, without pretending to do more than to divine the character of
 those impediments, which appear ever to prevent the changes of which a
plant is susceptible from proceeding beyond a certain limit, we seem to catch
 a glimpse of a general lavv^ of Nature, not limited to one of her kingdoms, but

--extending everywhere throughout her jurisdiction, a law, the aim of which

may be inferred to be, that of maintaining the existing order of the universe,

 without any material or permanent alteration, throughout all time, until the
Jiat of Omnipotence has gone forth for its destruction.

    The will, Avhich confines the variations in the vegetable structure within a
certain range, lest the order of creation should be disturbed by the introduc-
tion of an indefinite number of intermediate forms, is apparently the same in
its motive, as that which brings back the celestial Luminaries to their ori-
ginal orbits, after the completion of a cycle of changes induced by their
mutual perturbations; it is the same which says to the Ocean, Thus far
shalt thou go, and no further; and to the Winds, Your violence, however
apparently capricious and abnormal, shall nevertheless be constrained within

certain prescribed limits

                                 Ni faciat, maria et terras coelumque profundum,
                                Quippe ferant rapidi secum, verrantque per auras.

    The whole indeed resolves itself into, or at least is intimately connected
with, that law of symmetry to which Nature seems ever striving to confirm,
and which possesses the same significance in the organic world, which the law

of definite proportions does in the inorganic.
    It is the principle which the prophetic genius of Goethe had divined, long

before it had been proved by the labours of physiologists to be a reality, and
to which the poet attached such importance, that the celebrated discussion
as to its merits which took place in 1820 between Cuvier and Geoffrey St.
Hilaire so engrossed his mind, as to deprive him, as his biographer informs
us*, of all interest in one of the mostportentous political events of modern days

                                                 * Lewes' Life of Goethe, vol. ii.

which was enacting at the very same epoch, I mean the subversion of the
Bourbon dynasty.

    It is indeed not less calculated to subserve to the gratification of our
sense of the beautiful, than to provide against too wide a departure from
that order of creation which its great Author has from the beginning in-
stituted ; and, as two learned Professors of a sister kingdom have pointed
out in memoirs laid before this Association, and have since embodied in a
distinct treatise*, iiianifests itself not less in the geometrical adjustment of

--the branches of a plant, and of the scales of a fir-apple nay even, as they

have wished to prove, in the correspondence between the form of the fruit

--and that of the tree on which it grows than in the frequent juxtaposition of

the complementary rays of the spectrum, by which that harmony of colour
is jjroduced in Nature, which we are always striving, however unsuccessfully,

to imitate in Art.

   The law, indeed, seems to be nothing else than a direct consequence of that
unity of design pervading the universe, which so bespeaks a common Creator
of the existence in the mind of the Deity of a sort of archetype, to which His
various works have all to a certain extent been accommodated ; so that the
earlier forms of life may be regarded as types of those of later creation, and
the more complex ones but as developments of rudimentary parts existing in
the more simple. Here too we may perhaps trace an analogy with His dealings
with mankind, as unfolded in His Revealed Word ; from which we find, that
the earlier events recorded are often typical of those more modern, and that
Christianity itself is in some sense a development of the Jewish dispensation
which preceded it.

    I should apologize for dwelling so long upon the two departments of natu*
ral knowledge to which I have hitherto confined myself, were it not that
other sciences of a still higher rank than those treated of had been discussed
so fully in the Discourses of former Presidents.

    Whilst indeed this is the first occasion, save one, in which a Chemist has
had the honour of occupying the Chair of the British Association, it has on
no former occasion fallen to the lot of a professed Botanist to be thus distin-

guished. I have therefore consulted alike my own ease, and what was due to

the Sciences themselves, in making Chemistry and Botany the principal themes

of my discourse. Leaving, then, to the gifted friend who will discourse
before you next Monday evening " On the Correlation of Physical Forces,"

the task of connecting with those Powers of Nature that manifest themselves
in the phsenomena of chemical attraction or of cell-development, the im-
ponderable agents which form the proper subjects of branches of Physics not

here dwelt upon, and thus establishing the existence of that common brother-
hood among the Sciences, which furnishes the best plea for such Meetings

as the present, I will only further detain you by noticing one other field
of inquiry, in which I have ever felt a lively interest, although it has only

been in my power to bestow on it a casual attention, or to cultivate one

limited portion of the wide range which it embraces.
    Indeed Geology, the Science to which I now allude, has, during the last

twenty years, made such rapid strides, that those who endeavoured from an
early period of life to follow at a humble distance the footsteps of the great
leaders in that Science, obeying the impulse of such zealous and ardent

--spirits, as the one now, alas ! by the inscrutable decrees of Providence, lost
--to his friends and to Science, who constituted the Head of what was once

--called, I hope not too grandiloquently, the Oxford School of Geology, have,

if I may judge of others by myself, been often distanced in the race, and
when they endeavoured to make good their lost ground, found themselves

transported into a new, and to them an almost unknown region.

Thus the thorough exploration which has taken place of the Silurian and

Cambrian systems, through the exertions of two of our oldest and most

--valued Associates, has added a new province ought I not rather to say, a
--new kingdom ? to the domain of Geology, and has carried back the records of

the creation to a period previously as much unknown to us as were the annals

of the Assyrian dynasties before the discoveries of Sir Henry Rawlinson.

I might also be disposed to claim for the recent investigations of Botanists

some share in fixing the relative antiquity of particular portions of the globe,

for, from the floras they have given us of different islands in the Great Pacific,

it would appear, that the families of plants which characterize some groups

are of a more complicated organization than those of another. Thus whilst

Otaheite chiefly contains Orchids, Apocynese, Asclepiadeae and Urticeae ; the
Sandwich.Islands possess LobeliacPEe and Goodenoviae ; and the Galapagos

Islands, New Zealand and Juan Fernandez, Compositas, the highest form

perhaps of dicotyledonous plants.

   In deducing this consequence, however, I am proceeding upon a principle

which has lately met with opposition, although it was formerly regarded as

one of the axioms in geology.

Amongst these, indeed, there was none which a few years ago seemed so

little likely to be disputed, as that the classes of animals and vegetables which

possessed the most complicated structure were preceded by others of a more

simple one ; and that when we traced back the succession of beings to the
lowest and the earliest of the sedimentary formations, we arrived at length

at a class of rocks, the deposition of which must be inferred, from the

almost entire absence of organic remains, to have followed very soon after

the first dawn of creation. But the recognition of the footsteps and remains

of reptiles in beds of an earlier date than was before assigned to them,

tended to corroborate the inferences vvhich had been previously deduced

from the discovery, in a few rare instances, in rocks of the secondary age, of

mammalian remains ; and thus has induced certain eminent geologists boldly

to dispute, whether from the earliest to the latest period of the earth's history

any gradation of beings can in reality be detected.

Into this controversy I shall only enter at present, so far as to point out

an easy method of determining the fact, that organic remains never can

have existed in a particular rock, even although it may have been subjected

to such metamorphic action as would have obliterated all traces of their pre-

sence. This is simply to ascertain, that the material in question is utterly

destitute of phosphoric acid ; for inasmuch as every form of life appears to

be essentially associated with this principle, and as no amount of heat would

be sufficient to dissipate it when in a state of combination, whatever quantity

of phosphoric acid had in this manner been introduced into the rock, rau^

have continued there till the end of time, notwithstanding any igneous ope-

rations which the materials might have afterwards undergone. But as the

discovery of very minute traces of phosphoric acid, when mixed with the

other ingredients of a rock, is a problem of uo small difficulty, an indirect

method of ascertaining its presence suggested itself to me in some experi-

ments of the kind which I have instituted, namel}', that of sowing some kind

of seed, such for instance as barley, in a sample of the pulverized rock, and

determining whether the crop obtained yielded more phosphoric acid than

1856.                                                          e

was present in the grain, it being evident that any excess must have been
derived from the rock from which it drew its nourishment.

    Should it appear by an extensive induction of particulars, that none of
the rociis lying at the base of the Silurian formation, which have come before
us, contain more phosphoric acid than the minute quantity I detected in the
slates of Bangor and Llanberris, which were tested in the above manner, it
might perhaps be warrantable hereafter to infer, that we had really touched
upon those formations that had been deposited at a time when organic beings
were only just beginning to start into existence, and to which, therefore, the
term Azoic, assigned to these rocks by some of the most eminent of our geo-
logists, might not be inappropriate.

    The proofs of the former extension of glaciers in the northern hemisphere,
far beyond their actual limits, tend also to complicate the question which has
at all times so much engaged the attention of cosmogonists with respect to

the ancient temperature of the earth's surface ; compelling us to admit, that
at least during the later of its epochs, oscillations of heat and cold must have
occurred, to interfere with the progress of refrigeration which wa^ taking

place in the crust.

   On the other hand, facts of an opposite tendency, such as the discovery

announced at our last Meeting by Captain Belcher, of the skeleton of an
Ichthyosaurus in lat. 77░, have been multiplying upon us within the same
period ; inasmuch as they appear to imply, that a much higher temperature
 in former times pervaded the Arctic regions than can be referred to local
 causes, and therefore force upon us the admission, that the internal heat of
the nucleus of our globe must at one time have influenced in a more marked
 manner than at present the temperature of its crust.

    On the causes of this increased temperature, whether local or cosmical,
much elaborate research has been brought to bear, by Sir Charles Lyell in

 his celebrated ' Principles of Geology,' and by Mr. Hopkins in his Address to

 the Geological Society.

    The most extensive collection of facts, however, having reference to this
 subject, is contained in the Reports on Earthquake Phsenomena, published
 by Mr. Mallet in our Transactions, supplying, as they do, data of the highest
 importance to the full elucidation of the subject. For although the evidence
 I have myself brought togetiier in ray work on Volcanos might be sufficient
 to establish in a general way the connexion of earthquakes with that deep-
 seated cause which gives rise to the eruptions of a volcano, yet our interest

--is thereby only the more awakened in the phaenomena they present, ^just as

 Dr. Whewell's inquiries into the local variations of the Tides were valued all
 the more in consequence of the persuasion already felt, that lunar attraction
 was their principal cause.

    But if earthquakes bring under our notice chiefly the dynamical effects of
 this hidden cause of movement and of change, those of volcanos serve to
 reveal to us more especially their chemical ones ; and it is only by com-
 bining the information obtained from these two sources, together with those
 from hot springs, especially as regards the gaseous products of each, that we
 can ever hope to penetrate the veil which shrouds the operations of this
 mysterious agent; so as to pronounce, with any confidence, whether the
 effects we witness are due, simply to that incandescent state in which our
 planet was first launched into space, or to the exertion of those elective at-

--tractions which operate between its component elements, attractions which

 might be supposed to have given rise, in the first instance, to a more ener-
 getic action and consequently to a greater evolution of heat, than is taking
                 ADDRESS.                                    Ixvii

place at present, when their mutual affinities are in a greater measure

   Within the last twenty years much has been done towards the elucidation

of this problem, through the united investigations of Boussingault, of Deville,
and above all of Bunsen, with respect to the gases and other bodies evolved
from volcanos in their various phases of activity ; the results of which, how-

ever, do not appear to me to present anything irreconcileable with that view
of their causes which was put forth many years ago in the work I published.

   Whilst, however, the latter is offered as nothing more than as a conjectural
explanation of the phaenomenain question, I may remind those, who prefer the
contrary hypothesis on the ground that the oblate figure of the earth is in
itself a sufficient proof of its primaeval fluidity, that this condition of things
could only have been brought about in such materials by heat of an intensity,
sufficient, whilst it lasted, to annul all those combinations amongst the
elements which chemical affinity would have a tendency to induce, and thus
to render those actions to which I have ascribed the phEenomena, not only
conceivable, but even necessary consequences, of the cooling down of our

planet from its original melted condition.

   In the nearly allied Science of Geography, several important undertakings
have been set on foot, and some interesting discoveries made since the period

of our last Meeting.

   1. Dr. Kane has extended Arctic discovery, through Smith Strait, at the
head of Baffin Bay, to about 3 degrees nearer the Pole.

   2. Mr. Kelley has announced the result of several independent surveying
expeditions despatched by him to the Valley of the Atrato, with a view to the
formation of a great navigable channel through Central America, between the

Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. When Humboldt directed attention to this region

fifty years since, he had only uncertain reports to guide his anticipations ; and
these surveys have been the first to throw actual light upon this region.

   S. An expedition has been despatched to North Australia, for the purpose

of exploring the interior and tracing the extent of the northern watershed.
Its arrival at the mouth of the Victoria River has already been announced.

   4. It is pro{>osed, by the Geographical Society, to despatch an expedition
to Eastern Africa, to explore the extent of the inland waters known to exist
there, and if possible to discover the long-sought sources of the Nile.

   5. Explorations have been undertaken in the Rocky Mountains, by several
parties in South America, in the Pacific, and elsewhere : these, however, are
far too numerous to be particularly alluded to.

   Such are a few of the additions to our knowledge which have been made
in the course of the last twenty years in those sciences with which I am

most familiar.

Whilst, however, the actual progress which has taken place in them is in

itself so satisfactory, the change which the sentiments of the public have

undergone, with respect to their claims to respect, affi)rds no less room for

congratulation.

If our attention is turned to the metropolis, we see rising up around us

establishments for the advancement of Physical Science, of which our ances-

tors would scarcely have dreamed the possibility.
   I may instance the School of Mines, first placed under the management of

our late Associate, Sir Henry De la Beche, and now presided over bj Sir

Roderick Murchison, as a convincing proof of the improved feeling on such

subjects entertained by the Government of this country.

Ixviii                      --REPORT 1856.

   I may mention also another proof of a greater appreciation of the claims

of Science, in their having departed from the practice which had prevailed

ever since the death of Sir Isaac Newton, of regarding the Mastership of Her

Majesty's Mint a purely political appointment, and in conferring it, as they

have done on the two last occasions, as a reward for scientific eminence.

    It is also gratifying to find, that the attention of the Legislature has at

length been seriously called to consider what measures of a public nature

might be adopted for improving the position of Science and its cultivators,
and that the Royal Society has appointed a Body of its Members to receive

suggestions on that subject, and to report upon it, in order that a matured

plan may be presented to Parliament to meet this object at its next Session.

   Nor, if we extend our glance to the Provinces, need I go further than

the neighbourhood of our present place of meeting, in order to point out as
many as four active clubs of naturalists, who sustain as well as diflPuse an
interest in our pursuits, by frequf nt meetings, and by investigating, in com-

mon, the physical peculiarities of their respective neighbourhoods.
   In this very county, too, we have lately witnessed the first example of an

Institution founded for the express purpose of communicating to the rising

generation of farmers, that scientific as well as practical instruction, the union

of which is admitted by every enlightened agriculturist to be essential, for the
purpose of deriving the fullest advantage from the natural resources of our
soil. Nor can I help feeling an honest pride when I reflect, that this Esta-
blishment, which has since risen to such imporlance, and is celebrated
throughout the land as the best training school for youths destined to hus-
bandry which England affords, should have emanated from the members of

a little club existing in a neighbouring county-town, endeared to me by
long associations, Irom its near proximity to the place of my birth, and the
home of my earliest years.

    Turning, too, to the University to which I belong, in which a few years ago
our pursuits were hardly regarded as integral parts of academical instruction,
we now find in it at least a recognition of their importance to have taken place,
and Classical Literature no longer disdaining to own as her Sisters, the Studies
which engross so large a part of the attention of the public in general.

   Nay, the Academic Body has lately devoted no small portion of its
revenues towards the erection of a Museum, intended to comprehend under
one roof all the appliances for research, as well as all the means of instruction
which can be required in the several branches of Natural Philosophy.

   The extension, indeed, which is now given to the name in the language of
naturalists, and even by the public at large, is in itself an indication of
correcter views than were formerly entertained with regard to the uses of

such Establishments.

   Few, for instance, have such a notion of a Museum as Horace Walpole
gave utterance to at the close of the last century*, when he defined it "a

" hospital for everything that is singular-- whether the thing has acquired

--" singularity from having escaped the rage of time from any natural oddness,

Ф or from being so insignificant that nobody thought it worth while to pro-

" duce any more of the same."
   Nor will it be possible to ridicule these Institutions, as an eminent member

of my own University, even within my recollection, was temptid to do, in

alluding to the little Institutions of the kind set up in some of our pro-

vincial townsf.

   " The stuffed ducks, the skeleton in the mahogany case, the starved cat and

" rat which were found behind a wainscot, the broken potsherd from an old

" barrow, the tattooed head of the New Zealand chief, the very unpleasant-

" looking lizards and snakes coiled up in the spirits of wine, the flint-stones
" and cockle shells," &c., will no longer be seen jumbled together in hetero-
geneous confusion, as might have been the case at the period alluded to.

   The Ipswich Museum has set an example, which I have no doubt will be

generally followed, of selecting for such Institutions a series of types illus-
trative of the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms; and a Committee of

this Association is now employed in the useful undertaking of preparing a
list of objects calculated to illustrate the different forms in nature, and thus
rendering our provincial Museums no longer mere rareeshows, but places
where the masses may receive instruction in all branches of Natural History.

   But the Oxford Museum aims at much more than is usually understood
by that title. Its central area, indeed, may be regarded as the Sanctuary of
the Temple of Science, intended to include all those wonderful contrivances

by which the Author of the Universe manifests himself to His creatures;
whilst the apartments which surround it, dedicated as they will be to lectures
and researches connected with all branches of Physical Science, may repre-
sent the chambers of the ministering Priests, engaged in worshiping at her
altar, and in expounding her mysteries.

   In turning too to this Association, the reception Avith which it is now

greeted in the course of its migrations through the various portions of the
United Kingdom, is not less encouraging as an augury of the future pro-

spects of Science.

   Our Body, indeed, may now be said to have passed unscathed through

that ordeal to which all infant undertakings are exposed, and which even its
great prototype, the Royal Society of London, at its commencement, did not

altogether escape. And the best proof that such is the case, will be found in
the different manner in which it is received by the public in general.

   Twenty years ago the invitations sent us proceeded, either from places like
the Universities expressly dedicated to learning, and therefore peculiarly
called upon to lend a helping hand to Science ; or else from Cities, in which
the predominant occupations brought the mass of the population into inii-
mediate and constant connexion with scientific processes.

    Now, on the contrary, we have seen the two principal Centres of fashion-

-- --able resort the favourite retreats of the wealthy and noble of the land

vieing with each other in their eagerness to receive us ; and an almost purely
agricultural County greeting us with the same hearty welcome as that which we
had heretofore received from the commercial and manufacturing Communities.

    Twenty years ago it was thought necessary to explain at our meetings the
character and objects of this Association, and to vindicate it from the denun-
ciations fulminated against it by individuals, and even by parties of men,
who held it up as dangerous to religion, and subversive of sound principles

in theology.

   Now, so marked is the change in public feeling, that we are solicited by
the clergy, no less than by the laity, to hold our meetings within their pre-
cincts; and have never received a heartier welcome than in the city in which
we are now assembled, which values itself so especially, and with such good
reason, on the extent and excellence of its educational establishments.

    It begins, indeed, to be generally felt, that amongst the faculties of mind,
upon the development of which in youth success in afterlife mainly depends,
there are some which are best improved through the cultivation of the
Physical Sciences, and that the rudiments of those Sciences are most easily
acquired at an early period of life.
                                                                                                                                                                     I;

  --That power of minute observation those habits of method and arrange-
-- --ment that aptitude for patient and laborious inquiry that tact and sagacity

in deducing inferences from evidence short of demonstiation, which the
Natural Sciences more particularly promote, are the fruits of early education,
and acquired with difficulty at a later period.

   It is during childhood, also, that the memory is most fresh and retentive
and that the nomenclature of the sciences, which, from its crabbedness and
technicality, often repels us at a more advanced age, is acquired almost

without an effort.
    Although, therefore, it can hardly be expected, that the great schools in

the country will assign to the Natural Sciences any important place in their
systems of instruction, until the Universities for which they are tlie seminaries
set them the example, yet 1 cannot doubt, but that the signal once given, both
masters and scholars will eagerly embrace a change so Ci^ngenia! to the tastes
of youth, and so favourable to the development of tiieir intellectual faculties.

   And has not, it may be asked, the signal been given by the admission of

the Physical Sciences into the curriculum of our academical education ?

   I trust that this question may be answered in the affirmative, if we are
entitled to assume, that the recognition of them which has already taken
place will be consistently followed up, by according to them some such sub-
stantial encouragement, as that which has been afforded hitherto almost

exclusivelj^ to classical literature.

   Our ability to accomplish this, with the means and appliances at our com-
mand, does not, I think, admit of dispute.

    Happily for this country, the conservative feeling which has ever prevailed
amongst us, and the immunity we have enjoyed from such political con-
vulsions as have affected most other European nations, maintain in their
integrity those Academical Establishments, which, as Monsieur Montalembert
has remarked, are, like our Government and our other Institutions, a magni-
ficent specimen of the social condition of the middle ages, as it at one time
existed throughout the whole of Western Europe.

   They are Institutions, indeed, which foreigners may well look upon with
envy, but which when once destroyed, it is hopeless to expect that Govern-
ments, engrossed as they are with the interests and politics of the day, will

ever think of restoring.
   Thanks to their existence, it rarely happens, that a student, in Oxford at

least, who has distinguished himself in his classical examinations, fails to obtain
some reward for his past exertions, and. if he require it, some assistance to
enable him to continue them in future.

   And this, too, be it observed, has been the case, even whilst the natural,

although perhaps mistaken partiality of our founders, for their native counties,

for the parishes in which their estates lay, or for their own collateral descend-
ants, greatly curtailed the number of fellowships which could be bestowed

on merit.

   All, therefore, that seems wanted, now that local preferences seem on the
point of being removed, is, on the one hand, a more equal distribution of the
existing emoluments between the several professions, and, on the other, the

admission of the claims of the sciences received into our educational system,
to share in the emoluments which, up to this time, have been monopolized
by the Classics.

  --And as it is far from my wish to curtail the older studies of the University

of their proper share of support for who that has passed through a
course of them can be insensible of the advantages he has derived from

--that early discipline of the mind which flows from their cultivation?

ADDRESS.                                                                                      Ixxi

rejoice to think, that when the Legislature shall have completed the removal
of those restrictions which have hitherto prevented us in many instances
from consulting the claims of merit in the distribution of our emolu-
ments, there will be ample means afforded for giving all needful encourage-
ment to the newly recognized studies, without trenching unduly upon that
amount of pecuniary aid which has been hitherto accorded to the Classics.

    In anticipation of which change, I look forward with confidence to the daj'^,
when the requirements at Oxford, in the department of Physical Science, will
become so general and so pressing, that no Institution which professes to
prepare the youth it instructs for academical competition will venture to risk
its reputation by declining to admit these branches of study into its educa-

tional courses.

   Indeed the example has already been set in many, as I understand to be
the case with the noble Seminary within whose walls we are now assembled,
as well as with that older Establishment, which, under the energetic manage-
ment of its present head master, has become its worthy rival as a training

school for the Universities.

   At any rate, I trust the time has now passed away, when studies such as
those we recommend lie under the imputation of fostering sentiments

inimical to religion.

   In countries, and in an age in which men of Letters were generally tinc-
tured with infidelity, it is not to be supposed that Natural Philosophy would
altogether escape the contagion ; but the contemplation of the works of crea-
tion is surely in itself far more calculated to induce the humility that paves
the way to belief, than the presumption which disdains to lean upon the

supernatural.

    It is not, indeed, without an excusable feeling of exultation that in sur-

veying the triumphs of modern science, we see

" An intellectual mastery exercised

O'er the blind elements ;  a purpose given
                                                                                       ;

A perseverance fed ; almost a soul

Imparted to brute matter ;"

or that we repeat to ourselves the words in which the poet apostrophizes the

philosopher,

                        " Go, wondrous creature ! mount where Science guides,
                             Go, measure earth, weigh air, and state the tides

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

                            Instruct the planets in what orbs to run,
                             Correct old Time, and regulate the Sun."

Nevertheless, if we pursue the line of thought in which the same author
indulges, we shall be compelled to ask ourselves, not without a deep sentiment
of humiliation, even whilst contemplating the highest order of intellect which
the human race has ever exhibited,

                               " Could he, whose rules the rapid Comet bind,
                                  Describe or fix one movement of the mind ?

                            Who saw its fires here rise, and there descend,
                               Explain his own beginning, or his end ?"

   When indeed we reflect within what a narrow area our researches are

of necessity circumscribed, when we perceive that we are bounded in space

--almost to the surface of the planet in which we reside, itself merely a speck

in the universe, one of innumerable worlds invisible from the nearest of the

in wouder we may be at the vast fecundity of Nature, which within so narrow

more sensible shall we become of the small proportion, which our highest
powers and their iiappiest results bear, not only to the Cause of all causation,
but even to other created beings, higher in the scale than ourselves, which
we may conceive to exist.

                                   " Think thou this world of hopes and fears
                                      Could find no statelier than his peers
                                      In yonder hundred million spheres ? "

    It is believed, that every one of the molecules which make up the mass of
a compound body is an aggregate of a number of atoms, which, by their
arrangement and mutual relation, impart to the whole its peculiar properties ;
and, according to another speculation which has been already alluded to,
these atoms are not absolutely motionless, but are ever shifting their position

within certain limits, so as to induce corresponding changes in the properties

of the mass.
    Indeed it has been imagined, that the production of different compounds

from the same elements united in the same proportions, may be one of the
consequences resulting from the different arrangement of particles thereby

induced.
     If this hypothesis have any foundation in fact, what an example does it

set before us of great effects brought about by movements which, to our
senses, are too minute to be appreciable : and what an illustration does it
afford us of the limited powers inherent in the human race, which are never-
 theless capable of bringing about effects so varied, and to us so important
 although, as compared with the universe, so insignificant

   We also are atoms, chained down to the little globe in which our lot is

 cast; allowed a small field of action, and confined within definite limits, both
 as to space and as to time.

    We, too, can only bring about such changes in nature, as are the resultants
 of those few laws which it lies within the compass of our powers to investigate
 and to take advantage of.

    We, too, can only run through a certain round of operations, as limited in
 their extent, in comparison with those which lie within the bountis of our
 conception, as the movements of the atoms, which serve to make up a com-
 pound molecule of any of the substances around us, are to the revolutions of

 the heavenly Luminaries.

    And as, according to Professor Owen, the conceivable modifications of

 the vertebral archetj'pe are very far from being exhausted by any of the
 forms which now inhabit tiie earth, or that are known to have exi.-ted here
 at any former period ; so likewise the properties of matter with which we are

 permitted to become cognizant, may form but a small portion of those of
 which it is susceptible, or with which the Creator may have endowed it in

 other portions of the Universe.

    We are told, that in a future and a higher state of existence, the chief

 occupation of the blessed is that of praising and worshiping the Almighty.
 But is not the contemplation of the works of the Creator, and the study of
 the ordinances of the Great Lawgiver of the universe, in itself an act of
       ADDRESS.     Ixxiii

praise and adoration ; and, if so, may not one at least of the sources of
happiness which we are promised in a future state of existence, one of the
rewards for a single-minded and reverential pursuit after truth in our present
state of trial, consist in a development of our faculties, and in the power of
comprehending those laws and provisions of Nature with which our finite
reason prevents us at present from becoming cognizant ?

    Such are a few of the reflections which the study of Physical Science, cul-
tivated in a right spirit, naturally suggests ; and I ask you, whether they are
not more calculated to inspire humility than to induce conceit ; to render
us more deeply conscious how much of the vast field of knowledge must ever

--given us to lift up and therefore to dispose us to accept, with a more

unhesitating faith, the knowledge vouchsafed from on high, on subjects

which our own unassisted reason is incapable of fathoming.

                       REPORTS

                 THE STATE OF SCIENCE.

Report from the Committee appointed by the British Association fot

the Advancement of Science, at the Meeting in Liverpool, in Sep-
tember 1854, to investigate and report upon the effects produced

upon the Channels of the Mersey by the alterations which within the
last fifty years have been made in its Banks.

Your Committee have to report, that for the purpose of securing a satis-

factory solution of the questions submitted to their investigation, they deemed
it expedient to refer different portions of the inquiry to individual members
of their body, in the following manner :--

   1. Mr. George Rennie, to trace historically the important' projections into
the river, and reclamation of large areas of land which would exclude the

entry of water.

   2. Mr. Joseph Boult, to show important changes in the bottom, including
the channels and outlets of the river, so dividing the work that it may illus-

trate the effects of the above-named encroachments.
   3. Mr. Henderson, to compare the tides of the present period with the

tides registered by Mr. Rendell.

It has been thought desirable to present the reports of these gentlemen to

the Association unabridged, as affording the best solution of the subject
which has yet been prepared, and your Committee will therefore only refer

to the more salient points of the inquiry, and to the conclusions to be drawn

from the information laid before them.

Mr. Rennie's report is accompanied by copies of the following valuable

documents :

1. Report of Messrs. Wilkin relative to the navigation and conservancy o^

the River Mersey, 28th April 1840.

   2. Area and content of water in the River Mersey, from Blackrock to

Woolston Weir, above W^arrington, at certain tides, below and above Liver-

pool Old Dock sill, by George Rennie, 18th May 1838.

3. Index of the engineers' and surveyors' reports who have reported on the

estuary and River Mersey.

   4. First and second Memorial of the Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of
the Borough of Liverpool, April and September 1839.

   5. Letter from H. M. Denham, R.N., to the Corporation of Liverpool,
27th September 1836.

   6. Statement of the Town-clerk as to the rights of the Mayor, Aldermen,
and Burgesses of Liverpool to the lordship of Liverpool, comprising the
River Mersey up to the bridges and strand at Liverpool, Toxteth Park, Bir-
kenhead, and Wallasey.

    The history of the Mersey is well detailed by Messrs. Wilkin down to the

 date of their inquiry. From their report it appears that until 1818 there
 was no check or control exercised by any authority over encroachments upon
 the tidal area of the river. In that year the Corporation of Liverpool, whose
jurisdiction extended from Hoylake to Hesketh jBank on the Ribble, and all
 over the River Mersey to Warrington and Frodsham Bridges, and who had
 authority to remove any obstructions to the navigation, " be it the ground
 or soil of the King's most excellent Majesty, or any other person or persons,
bodies politic or corporate whatsoever," called in Mr. Whidbey, of Plymouth
Breakwater,to examine the encroachmentswhich had been made on the estuary
at different parts, and to lay down some general principles as to its future
preservation. Subsequently Mr. Rennie, Sen., and Messrs. Chapman, Giles,
Walker, Mylne, Stevenson, and George and John Rennie, reported in con-

--firmation of the general principles laid down by Mr. Whidbey. They may

be briefly stated as follows : " That tide harbours are deep or otherwise in
proportion to the quantity of water which flows and ebbs through their
channels, and that to embank portions of the tidal area is to diminish that
quantity of water and consequently to injure the harbour." So completely
had these principles been contravened in former days, that it appears from
Mr. Rennie's calculation of the area and content of water in the River
Mersey (No. 2), that the original tidal area was 36,500 acres, of which
13,440 acres were then (1838) lost to the tideway, being enclosed marshes.

   The very elaborate survey of the Mersey, from the Blackrock to Woolston
Weir, which was prepared about thirty years since by the late Mr. Giles,
C.E., for the Corporation of Liverpool, is an invaluable and unique docu-
ment. As it is plotted to an adequate scale, and furnishes data for determining
the extent of any changes, either in the area or depth of the river, since that
date. As, however, the survey has not yet been repeated, your Committee
have been unable to investigate the changes in that part of the Mersey
there is reason to believe that some of them have important relations to the
well-being of the river, and the great interests in either shore. Amongst
others, the mutations in the Devil and Pluckington Banks, and the waste of
various portions of the shore are the most remarkable.

    Unfortunately, Mr. Giles's survey did not include the outer estuary or.
Liverpool Bay ; of this frequent and excellent surveys have been made
during the last twenty-three years by Capt. Denham, and his successor Lieut.
Lord, who, as marine surveyors to the port, exercised unceasing vigilance on
the changes within the sphere of their observations. Mr. Boult's attention
has been espacially directed to the alterations recorded by these surveys,
and to the influence which may have been exercised upon those alterations
by the dock-works of Liverpool and Birkenhead, and by meteorological phae-,
nomena. The changes in the areas and positions of the several banks have
been laid down in coloured outlines, upon the accompanying charts* A, B,
and C, and the alterations in their cubical contents and in the average areas
of the sea channels, as far as they can be approximately ascertained from the
surveys, are recorded in the tables D, E, F, and G.

   From these it appears that there has been a progressive, though irregular,

   * Of these charts it has been found desirable to publish Chart A. only ; as the scale to
which the illustrations are necessarily restricted is too small to permit distinctness in the

several contours.
                   ;

THE RIVER MERSEY.  3

increase in the sizes of the banks, the growth having been both lateral and
vertical ; some of the fluctuations are very remarkable ; that the average
area of the northern, channel remains very stationary, though in places the
mutations have been considerable ; and that there has been a diminution of
average area in the Rock Channel, arising from a deposit of silt at the
eastern end. This channel is the oldest known entrance into the Mersey
it is laid down by Captain Collins in his survey of 1689, who says of the
northern channel (by way of Crosby and Formby) that it is not buoyed or
beaconed, and so not known. There appear to be grounds for serious ap-
prehensions that the Rock Channel may be irrecoverably lost, if due pre-
cautions are not adopted in good time.

    There have been extraordinary fluctuations in the seaward entrance of the
northern channel within the period embraced in this inquiry, and at this
present time another great change is being accomplished, namely, the sub-
stitution of the Queen's Channel for the Victoria Channel, inteimediate
between the latter and the Zebra Channel.

    There is reason to believe that the growth of the banks and the silting up
of part of the Rock Channel have been much promoted by the abstraction
of area which has taken place for dock purposes ; nor is this surprising when
we find the extent of this abstraction, and the important part of the river,
especially in relation to the Rock Channel, where it has been made.

   Between 1846 and 1859, or in six years, it seems that as much as 500

acres have been enclosed for the dock-works of Liverpool and Birkenhead,

and the result apparently confirms the correctness of the principle laid down
by Mr. Whidbey and other eminent engineers who have reported upon the
river, as indicating the consequence of diminishing the scouring power of
the last of the flood and the first of the ebb, the situations of the abstractions
referred to being in parts of the river which are occupied by those portions

of the tidal waters.
    It appears from Mr. Boult's researches, that the change of direction in the

channels is not so much the result of the direction of the dock walls as of
alterations in the size and position of the sand-banks ; alterations which seem

to be due to the permanent loss of scouring power, by abstraction of tidal
area ; to the temporary increase of that loss from drought ; to the temporary
accession of scouring power from freshes; and to the drifts of sand by the .
winds to which the bay is peculiarly exposed, and which are the prevailing
winds on this part of the coast. The extent of this sand-drift is so great,
that, since Collins's survey, the eastern shore of the estuary appears to have
advanced westward as much as one-half the width of the northern channel,
or about 1000 yards.

   It is possible that the deterioration of the Rock Channel is to be ascribed,
in part, to the erection of the new north wall at Liverpool. It is built on

the Bootle shore, almost immediately opposite the junction of that channel

with the northern channel, and directly across the direction of the tidal
stream in the Rock Channel. Therefore, the flood-stream entering the river
by that channel is suddenly checked by this upright wall, and is deprived of
the space formerly allowed by the sloping Bootle shore for gradually changing
its direction into that of the main course of the river and the northern

channel.

    It was observed by Messrs. Whidbey, Chapman, and Rennie, in their
Report to the Corporation of Liverpool in 1822, that " all channels through
which water flows must be of a magnitude proportionate to the quantity
^rhich passes them, and anv increase or diminution of that quantity will

                                                                       ╗2
--4 REPORT 1856.

enlarge or diminish the channel, unless when formed of materials so hard that
the strength of the current is not able to remove them." The truth of this
observation is strikingly confirmed by the remarkable waste of the clay cliffs
of the Cheshire shore of the river at Seacombe and Egremont. This has
been observed for many years past ; but, according to the evidence which
accompanies the report of Mr. Walker, C.E., printed by order of the House
of Commons, 23rd June 1856, it has greatly increased within the last ten
years, or since so much of the tideway on the opposite shore has been

abstracted for the north dock- works.

   The result of the inquiry, so far as your Committee have been able to
prosecute it, shows the vital importance of a strict conservancy of the River
Mersey in all its tidal area, in order that it may be preserved for the vast

--commerce centered on its shores. There is no doubt that injury to a great
--extent irremediable has been already inflicted, not only upon some of the

owners of property on its margin, but also upon the river itself, more espe-
cially upon its approaches. Your Committee conceive that the nature and
extent of this injury should be determined as accurately and as speedily as

possible ; that the trade on this river is vastly too important in its relation to
the national prosperity, for the subject of this inquiry to be left to a committee,
however zealous, which is unendowed with pecuniary resources, and dependent
for information upon the researches of gentlemen actively engaged in official
and professional occupations ; and that the result of such an investigation

would be highly beneficial to the science of harbour engineering. The
scientific value of the information so acquired would be greatly enhanced
were the phasnomena of all our tidal harbours subjected to similar research.
It is not unreasonable to expect that the ultimate result would give greater
certainty as to the influence of projected works upon the well-being of the
harbours with which they are associated ; and relieve the Legislature from

the responsibility of sanctioning un'dertakings the destructive or conservative
eflects of which, at present, are often very speculative.

Report on the past and present state of the Estuary of the Mersey within the
   last seventy years, as derivedfrom historical records, and according to the
   maps, charts, and reports of different Engineers, and ivhich have been laid

    before the Committee appointed by the British Association at its meeting at

   ByLiverpool, September 1 854, to investigate and report upon the same.

   George Rennie, F.R.S.

   The early history of the Mersey, previous to the beginning of the present

century, is confined to the uncertain statements of tojjographical writers such
as Lcland, Gough, King, Ormerod, Mortimer, and others; and the charts of
Captain Collins in lf;S9, and by M'Kenzie in 1760.

   According to the original constitution of the charters and grants made
from tiine to time to the borough of Liverpool, the boundaries of that port
were adopted by a commission issued 19th July, 32 Charles II., which i-ecited
an Act passed in the 14t]i year of the then king's reign, tor "preventing
frauds and regulating abuses in the Customs ;" and also an Act of the 1st of
Elizabeth. It was settled in November 1680, that the boundaries of the port
THE RIVER MERSEY.  5

of Liverpool should be "from the Red Stones on the point of Wirrall south-
erly, to the foot of the Ribble water in a direct line northerly, and so upon
the south side of the said river to Hesketh Bank easterly." These limits
were adopted in the Dock Act of Anne, and subsequent dock acts, as the
limits of the crown revenues, and have been adhered to down to the present
time. The limits of the old borough and parish of Liverpool bordering on
the Mersey are thus defined, viz " The western boundary commences at
low-water mark of the River Mersey, where a brook, called Beacon's Gutter,
enters the river, and continues thence southward along the low-water mark
of the said river, to the centre of a certain slip or basin called Etna Slip.
The southern boundary commences from the centre of Etna Slip, and runs
from thence to the eastward, across the southernmost end of the Queen's
Dock. The northern boundary returns along the Beacon's Gutter, to the
beforementioned low-water mark of the river." The 8th of Anne, 1709,

defined the limits of the port of Liverpool to extend as far Jis " a certain place

in Hoylake called the Red Stones, and from thence all over the River Mersey
to Warrington and Frodsham Bridges." These boundaries and rights of the
Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses to the lordships of Liverpool, comprising the
River Mersey up to the bridges and to the strand at Liverpool, Toxteth Park,
Birkenhead, and Wallasey, are fully explained in the accompanying statement,
No. 6, as also in the second memorial of the Liverpool Corporation to the
Admiralty, No. 4. According to a statement made by Mr. RoUet, surveyor
of Wallasey embankment, at the fifth meeting of the Architectural and
Archaeological Society of Liverpool, in 1854, the sea had formerly effected
a direct entrance into the valley of the Mersey through its present channel,
from which, he believed, it had been separated previously by a diluvial deposit
of clay, boulders, and sand, and that after it had so effected its entrance, its
progress, in forming a deep channel, would be gradual. In proof of which
he cited the authority of Captain Collins, " That great ships belonging to

Liverpool put out at Hyle, or Hoylake, part of their lading until they are

light enough to sail over the flats of Liverpool."

   The charts of Collins and M'Kenzie, although taluable as records, can
scarcely be depended upon. The first authentic survey of the port of Liver-
pool, by Captain George Thomas, in 1813, and published in 1815, and the
subsequent and more accurate surveys of Denham, in 1833 and 1837, and of
Lord, in 1840, 1841 and 1852, are proofs of the anxiety evinced by the
Corporation of Liverpool to employ officers of the Admiralty in recording
accurately the actual state of the banks and channels, and the changes which
have taken place between those periods. These are very fully detailed in
the accompanying report of Mr. Boult, who has taken more than usual pains
to compare the different plans with one another and with Captain Thomas's,
and has shown in contour and coloured lines the remarkable changes which
have taken place in the sea banks and channels at the entrance of the Mersey.

These changes show the necessity of causing annual surveys to be made, as
set forth in the report of Messrs. Mylne and Rennie, in 1837.

   The history of the Mersey is also well detailed in the accompanying report
of Messrs. John and George Wilkin. Those gentlemen show that, in 1818,
Mr. Whidbey, of Plymouth, was the first whose assistance was called in by
the Mayor and Corporation to examine the encroachments which had been
made on the estuary in different parts, and to lay down some general princi-
ples as to its future preservation. Subsequently, Mr. Rennie, sen., Messrs.
Chapman, Giles, Walker, Mylne, Stevenson, and George and John Rennie,
reported in confirmation. Extracts from the reports of some of these engi-

neers will show how their predictions have been corroborated, and how

necessary it was to fi-ame and constitute a Commission of Conservancy. This

was done upon the principles laid down by Messrs. W. C. Mylne and George

 Rennie, in their report of 1837, as also from the assistance of the marine
surveyor. Lieutenant Lord.

    The general principles laid down by Messrs. Whidbey, Chapman and

 Rennie, in their report of 1822, to the Corporation of Liverpool, were
    " That all channels through which water flows must be of a magnitude

proportional to the quantity which passes them ; and any increase or dimi-
jiution of that quantity will enlarge or diminish the channel, unless where
formed of material so hard that the strength of the current is not able to
remove them."

    Mr. Whidbey says, in his report of 1818, "Tide harbours are deep or
otherwise, in proportion to the quantity of water that flows into them from
the esa, and the fresh water that comes down from the interior. The greater
the quantity of water, the greater will be the depth, from the eff'ect which
the increased body of water will have in scouring the bottom at the time of
the ebb tide, and carrying out the sullage."

    Again, with reference to embankments, Mr. Whidbey says,
    " It is evident that if a certain portion of either side of a river or harbour
be embanked, and the tide be prevented from flowing over it in its usual
way, a diminished quantity of water will flow in from the sea equal to the
cubic contents of what has been embanked, and consequently there will be a
less quantity to ebb out ; and the scouring effect being thereby lessened, it
will be rendered incapable of carrying out to sea the sullage and alluvious
matter washed down from the country, with the same force as before the
embankment was made."
    The same principle was advocated by Messrs. Chapman, Rennie, Walker,
Giles and Stevenson, in all their subsequent reports relative to encroachments,
and to obstructions made to the free flow of the tide by piers and jetties.
    The very accurate survey and maps of the estuary made by Mr. Giles for
the Corporation, by the recommendation of the late Mr. Rennie, is one of
the most valuable records of any harbour in existence. It forms, in fact, the
standard for all future surveys, with reference to any changes which may

take place.

    The annexed is a catalogue of the reports which have been made by the
engineers and surveyors of the Mersey. The calculation of the area and
contents of the estuary of the Mersey between the Blackrock at entrance,
and Woolston Weir above Warrington, as shown by the annexed tables,
No. 2, are taken from Mr. G. Rennie's report of 1838.

    Captain Denham, the surveyor to the port, in his report of 1836, gives his
opinions on the causes of variations of the Devil and Pluckington Banks, and
expresses considerable doubt how far their removal could be effected by
jetties projected from the Cheshire shore.

   Lieutenant Lord, who succeeded him as surveyor, in his report of 3rd April,
1840, proposed a similar remedy. The question had been previously dis-
cussed, and remedies proposed, by former engineers. Lieutenant Lord's
report of the 23rd March, IS^O, entirely coincides with the opinion of former
engineers in the necessity of preserving the whole of the estuary and its
tributary streams from encroachments, and the necessity of guarding the
shores from the action of tlie winds and waves by defences of stone, and that
the limits of high-water margin should be accurately defined.

   As regards the tides, these have been accurately defined for a long period

by Mr. Giles, in his great survey ; and the very valuable observations on the

rise and fall of the tides in the Mersey, from Formby Point to Warrington

Bridge, taken during the years 1840, 1841 , 1842, and 1843, by Mr. Rendell--

as shown by the diagrams in the first and second volumes of Mr. Thomas

--Webster's work, 1848, 1853 leave . nothing to be desired in point of

excellence.

With such records, the Commissioners of Conservancy have only to

impress upon their surveyors the necessity of making frequent inspec-

tions of the whole of the estuary, and annual surveys of its banks and

channels, so that this invaluable port shall be maintained, in future, in its

full integrity.

Mr. Boult's report, which accompanies this, enters most fully into the

details of the changes which have taken place in the direction and depths of

the sea channels. The increase or diminution of the sand-banks, from the

first publication of Captain George Thomas's map, in 1815, down to 1854,

accompanied by an elaborate table, showing the average cubical contents of

the Great Burbo, Brazil, and North Bank, and the banks of Formby, Taylor,

Jordan, Mud-wharf, Middle, Little Burbo, and Outlying, and East Hoyle,
from which it will be seen that in 1840 there is a slight decrease from 1837;

for the years 1846 and 1852 a considerable increase; and a slight diminution

in 1854. These tables are analysed with great minuteness by Mr. Boult;

and the accompanying charts, in colours, illustrate distinctly the variations*.
The valuable meteorological and historical information which Mr. Boult has
brought forward, entitle him to the best thanks of the Committee.

time possessed would be wanting to enable us to make a final report on the

state of the River Mersey, and for recommending such measures for the

improvement of the navigation, and for preventing further encroachments on

its shores.

This inquiry has caused much labour and attention on our parts,

from the beginning of the month of March 1839, and having spent nearly

three months in Liverpool for the purpose of communicating with those

a regular survey, and for that purpose, at our recommendation, the Corpora-

manor, and whether courts are held, and whether any, and what, claims are

Mersey having of late years been the subject of much complaint, attracted
the attention of the Corporation of Liverpool, who have, from the year 1818

to the present time, in their anxiety to improve the navigation of the river,
expended large sums of money in consulting the most eminent engineers,
and in obtaining their reports, opinions and surveys on the state of the river;
viz. in the year ISIS, the late Mr. Whidbey, the contractor of the Break-
water at Plymouth ; in 1832, a second report from him, in conjunction with

Messrs. Chapman and John Rennie; in 1823, by Mr. Chapman ; in 1826, by
Mr. Whidbey, and Messrs. George Rennie and Giles; in 1826, a second
report from Mr. Giles; in 1827, by Mr. Robert Stevenson, also by Messrs.
"Walker and Mylne; in 1826, by Captain Denham, R.N., and in'l837, by
Messrs. Mylne and G. Rennie. The late Mr. Telford, Messrs. Nimmo and
Fowls have also been consulted by the Corporation and reported thereon
(No. 2).

    It appears from the evidence (No. 3) taken before a committee of the

House of Commons in the session of 1838, on a bill of the Grand Junction
Railway Company, in which they proposed to erect a bridge over the

Mersey at Runcorn, and to take a branch of the railway over it (which was
rejected), tiiat the area of the Mersey from Black Rock at the Mouth to
Woolston Weir above Warrington Bridge (where the tide ceases), is 2f?,062
acres, over which, at a 22-feet tide, 736,945,215 tons of water flow, and
that no less than 13,440 acres of marshes have been abstracted from the
tideway, equal to about 25 millions of tons of water, calculated at the same

tide.

    For the purpose of more clearly showing the want of a proper authority to
control and improve the navigation of the Mersey, we have thought it de-

sirable to make extracts from the Reports of the engineers ; all of whom

are of opinion that the principal causes for obstructing the navigation of the

river are the embankments made for enclosing large tracts of marsh lands
over which the tide formerly flowed ; the numerous piers, jetties and che-
vrons which impede the flux and reflux of the tide, and decrease the water
space. They observe, that all the channels through which water flows must
be of a magnitude proportional to the quantity passing through them ; that
if a certain portion of either side of a river or harbour be embanked, and the
tide be prevented from flowing over it in its usual way, a diminished quan-
tity of water will flow in from the sea equal to the cubic contents of what
has been embanked, consequently there will be a less quantity to ebb out,
thereby decreasing the scouring effect, and preventing the suliage and allu-
vial matter being washed down with sufficient force to prevent the old chan-
nels becoming choked up.

   They further state, that the preservation and improvement of navigable
channels depend entirely upon the flux and reflux of the tide and the dis-
charge of fresh waters, which cause an eff'ectual scour. That in no case can
there be too much backwater, it being well known that a number of rivers
and harbours have been ruined from the want of preserving the backwater.

Two harbours are noticed by Mr. Whidbey, viz. Portsmouth, as having

been seriously injured, and Rye, as having been entirely ruined by encroach-

ments on the mud land.

  --jReport dated llthJuhj, 1818 (No. 2). Mr. Whidbey says, the Mersey is

an inlet of the sea, rather than a river, being kept open entirely by the
quantity of water that flows into it, and not by the trifling streams which it
receives at Warrington and Frodsham Bridges ; that tidal harbours are deep
or otherwise in proportion to the quantity of water that flows into them from
THE BIVER MERSEY.  ╗

the sea, and the fresh water that conies down from the interior ; the greater
the quantity of water, the greater will be the depth from the effect which
the increased body of water will have in scouring the bottom at the time of

the ebb tide in carrying out the suUage.

   He observes, that if all the mud lands above and below Ince, and above

and below Runcorn, were embanked, leaving a channel only for the waters
that come from the country to discharge themselves, the total ruin of Liver-
pool would be the consequence. The backwater would be so much dimi-
nished that the scouring effect would be destroyed, and the sand driven in
towards tlie entrance of the Mersey by the violence of the north-west and
western gales, would in time accumulate beyond the possibility of removal.

   He alludes to an Act passed in the 46 Geo. III. cap. 153, for protecting

harbours and navigable rivers, but considers it does not go far enough, and
thinks the Corporation should lose no time in obtaining an Act giving them
the necessary powers for the preservation of the harbour of Liverpool, re-
serving to the Mersey and Irwell Company all powers granted to them

under their Acts.

   He further observes, that it is a prevailing opinion, that if water-courses

be narrowed, the channels through which the water has to run will become
deeper ; which would be the case if the water always ran one way, being pro-
duced from springs in the country ; it must be discharged into the sea some-
where, therefore the more it is confined the deeper will be the channel
through which it runs, but the contrary will be the case where the tide runs

in and out every twelve hours.
    Report dated ^Bth May, 1822 (No. 2).--Messrs. Whidbey, Chapman and

 John Rennie state, that on a careful examination between Runcorn and
 Fidler's Ferry at high and low water they found large tracts of marsh land

 without the present line of banks, and serving as important receptacles for

backwater. On the banks and shores they observed numerous jetties, erected

 for the protection of the land against the violence of the current, extending

 in many instances much further than necessary, and for the most part ope-
 rating as injurious impediments to the tideway, which, by obstructing its
 course, diminish its velocity, and allow time for the alluvial matter with
 which it is impregnated to be deposited and form banks and shoals highly
 injurious to the navigation, particularly mentioning one at Halton, and
 another near the old Quay Canal entrance. The Ince Ferry Quay has also
 an injurious effect, but they do not recommend its removal, on account of its

 absolute necessity for the purposes of commerce, but that openings should

 be made through it in various places, and arching them over. Several other

jetties are detrimental, and should be removed.

    They also recommend that no time should be lost in obtaining sufficient

 powers to enable the Corporation to have the complete conservatorship or
 control of the river Mersey and all its branches, to the end that when any

 encroachments are making by jetties, embankments or otherwise, they may

 have full power to cause them to be removed.
     In obtaining the powers here recommended, they'conceive there can be

 little or no difficulty, for all the leading interests of the country are combined
 in the necessity of maintaining and improving the navigation of the port of

  Liverpool, and none more so than the adjacent landholders, the value of
 whose estates must necessarily rise and fall with the population of this great
 commercial emporium, which is certainly of far greater importance to them
  than any advantage that can be derived from the acquisition of any land

  over which the tide flows.
--10 REPORT 1856.

  --Report dated 26th June, 1826 (No. 2). Messrs. Whidbey, G. Rennie and

 Giles make strong observations on the jetties, piers and chevrons from Fid-
 ler's Ferry to Halton Point, which they think should be removed. They
 also notice the land embanked by Sir R. Brooke, and the encroachments
 made by the Mersey and Irwell Company, also at Ince Quay, Tranmere Bay,
 Wallasey Pool, and Seacombe.

    They recommend that a quay or other boundary-line along the whole of
 the shores of the river Mersey and its inlets within the influence of the tide,
 should be accurately defined upon plans confirmed by Parliament. In order
 also that this important object may be effected in the most conciliatory and
 equitable manner, it should as far as possible be concerted witii the land-
owners upon the principle of compensation lor such lands as may be required

 for that purpose.

  --Report dated ith October. 1826 (No. 2). Mr. Giles is of opinion, that by

the means of a shore and river- wall such a uniformity of flood and ebb cur-
rent will be established up and down the river as to produce tlie best scouring
effect of the tide and land waters, and particularly upon the ebb tide, which
will be directed more forcibly upon the south-east end of the Liverpool
shore than at present, so as not only to prevent a further accumulation of
bank, but most probably to lessen the present extent and height of it. That
the further result of forming such uniform lines of shore and river-wall will
equalize and distribute the currents more over the river above Liverpool in

particular, so as to prevent in a great degree the accumulation of mud and

other sediment under the river-walls, and at the entrance to the docks gene-
rally, and at the same time render the navigation of vessels more direct and
easy than can be the case through the various partial forces of currents and

eddies of the present tideway.

  --Report dated December 1826 (No. 2). Messrs. Rennie and Giles have

given particular consideration to the sea channels, and to the river from Black
Rock to Runcorn, and from thence to Woolston Weir, where the tide ceases.
They say it is admitted by all intelligent and impartial men, that the pre-
servation and improvement of the navigable channels of a river depend en-
tirely upon the flux and reflux of the tidal waters, and the discharge of
fresh waters, and that these have the most powerful effect during high spring
tides and rainy seasons in scouring and deepening the channels through
which such waters must flow. It is scarcely possible that a case can exist

where a port or river can have too much backwater. There is a material

tendency of the flood tide to drive in from the sea portions of sand, and a
similar tendency of the inland waters to bring down sand and alluvial matter,
and these find upon some parts of the shore of a river places and eddies
where certain depositions of them will take place, and thus diminish the
capacity of the river to that degree as will nearly balance or bring into
equilibrium the content of water in the river with the power or force of
currents which that content will produce both in its flowing into and ebbing
out of the river. Taking it therefore as an axiom that no such thing can

occur as a harbour having too much backwater, except what may be pro-
duced occasionally by mountain torrents, but not by the reflow of tidal waters,

the general principle that the tide of a river, particularly in the upper parts
of it, should be carefully protected by all possible means, is applicable in its
fullest extent in the case of the Mersey, the fact of there being no excess
of backwater in the Mersey having been fully ascertained.

    It is too obvious to need argument, that water ebbing from the higher
parts of the Mersey is infinitely more valuable than from the lower parts foB
THE RIVER MERSEY.  11

the purpose of effecting a scour ; the water from the highest parts having
to run through the greatest length of the navigable channels in its passage
to Liverpool, and afterwards through the sea channels at a period when the
tidal waters have considerably ebbed, and when those channels are narrowed

within the banks that enclose them.

    The centre of Liverpool is about three and a half miles above the mouth
of the river, while Runcorn is nearly twenty miles ; the value, therefore, of
the tide at Runcorn compared with that at Liverpool (taking it only at the
relative distance between those places), is nearly as 5 to 1 ; but it is also
beneficial in a manifold degree in consequence of its operating so much
more powerfully to scour the bed of the channels at Liverpool and the sea
channels than any water can do which is discharged from situations nearer
the mouth of the river in the early parts of the ebb tide. Another circum-
stance may be cited in favour of preserving the tidal waters at Runcorn,
and particularly upon the flat stones near to the level of high water. The
fact has been proved by Mr. Giles, that the spring tides actually rise one" foot
and a half higher at Runcorn than at Liverpool, consequently any enclosure
of such shores at Runcorn must be exceedingly injurious.

   Too much vigilance therefore cannot be exercised in preserving the tidal
waters at Runcorn, and also in having it discharged by the natural ebb of

the tide.

  --Report dated 30th January, 1827 (No. 2). Mr. R. Stevenson states, as a

principle which ought to regulate all operations upon the banks of rivers,
that backwaters, are essential to the preservation of such rivers in a navi-

gable state ; and with regard to the Mersey, he is of opinion that the great
influx and reflux of tides into this estuary every twelve hours is what alone
preserves the Horse and Formby Channels in their present navigable state.

To the preservation of these channels all the arguments relating to the back-
water resolve themselves. An alteration in the depth or direction of these

channels might be attended with consequences most serious to Liverpool,

encumbered as its entrance is with sand-banks of a great extent.

   He also recommends that the jurisdiction of the conservators should

follow the high-water mark in all its gambols, though trenching sometimes
upon one side of the estuary and sometimes upon the other, and that they
should take the most prompt cognizance of all works undertaken upon the

ebb, or between the points of high and low water. He conceives that a
distinction should be made between works intended for the legitimate pur-

pose of navigation, and those which have for their object the acquirement

of firm ground at the expense of the backwaters of the river.

 --Report dated 2>\st January, 1827 (No. 2). Messrs. Walker and Mylne

state that the Mersey is only deeper at Liverpool than at Warrington, be-

cause the greater quantity of water at Liverpool requires a greater area to
pass it. If the tide was excluded, the Mersey at Liverpool would by the de-

posit of matter brought down from the interior soon diminish to the same size
as at Warrington, and the entrance from the sea would soon sand up, leaving

space sufficient only to pass the water of the river in this diminished state.

 --Report dated 21th September, 1836 (No. 2*). Captain Denham says, the

progress of Pluckington Bank, since 1828, has been a horizontal increase

of 210 yards abreast of Brunswick Basin, abreast of King's Dock 123 yards,
and abreast of Duke's Dock only 40 yards. Its respective elevations he
cannot quote between these dates, but since 1834< he finds it grown up one
foot off Brunswick Dock, two feet off Brunswick Basin, three feet off Duke's

Dock, and one foot off Canning Dock, during which its low-water margin

has yielded 50 yards directly off Brunswick Basin. Simultaneous with this
two years' fluctuation, the Devil's Bank has warped 143 yards towards the

eastern shore, lowered in altitude four feet, but elongated towards Plucking-

ton Shelf 250 yards, so that the spit of the Devil's Bank and Pluckington

--Shelf is within one-fourth of a mile of uniting with each other, an event to

be feared, seeing that the Devil's Spit has elongated two-thirds of a mile in

eight years, but which should be averted with all anxiety, for in the space
between them being shoaled up to a bar of six feet instead of fifteen, the
Garston branch of the Mersey will scour its way through the Swatchway
just above Otter's Pool, dividing the Devil's Bank from Eastham Sands, and

join the main column of ebb stream down the Cheshire side of the river.

  --Report dated March ] 837 (No. 2). Messrs. Mylne and G. Rennie state,

that from a rough estimate of the quantity of land which has been em-

banked out of the river above Runcorn, and which is still under the level
of ordinary spring tides (or 22 feet on the Old Dock Sill), the present water
surface only amounts to one-fifth of the whole. Below Runcorn the marshes
of Widness, Ditton, Frodshara, Stanlow, and Wallasey, amount to nearly
one-half the whole ; or in other words, the total quantity of land embanked
out of the Mersey exceeds the total quantity of water surface. In laying
down quay lines in the Mersey, the following principles should be ad-

hered to :

   1st. To preserve to the fullest extent the receptacles for the tide water.
   2nd. To designate the boundaries by mere stones placed at intervals.
   3rd. To have power to excavate and improve the bed of the river.
   4th. To prevent encroachments, whether by embanking lands or accumu-

lating matter by means of jetties.
   5th. To prevent jetties, or other open or solid works of any kind, from

being projected into the river without the consent of the Conservators.

   6th. To prevent ballast or other solid matter from being thrown into the

river.

   7th. To raise and remove wrecks or other obstructions.
   8th. To cut off or remove projecting points of rocks, without prejudice to
existing interests, buildings or jetties which may tend to obstruct the

free effect of the current of the tides ; and to erect quay walls or other

works which may assist the operation or diversion of the tide for the

general benefit of the port.

   They conclude by recommending a Commission of Conservancy, not only

for the benefit of the port, but the public in general.
   For the remedy of the evils mentioned in their reports, the engineers all

recommend that the conservancy should be vested in the Corporation of

Liverpool by Act of Parliament, with powers to remedy these evils, and to

render the navigation as perfect as circumstances will admit.

  We have been induced to make these copious extracts from the reports,

as they so clearly point out the difficulties attending the navigation of the

river, and the probability of tlie most serious consequences following, if

powers are not given to the Corporation by Act of Parliament, to improve

Wethe navigation.  have personally inspected the state of the river, and

are perfectly satisfied with the correctness of their reports and observations

thereon, and are convinced that the navigation is yearly becoming more

difficult, and that the obstructions will continue to increase if Parliamentary
provision is not made for its improvement, perhaps to the ultimate ruin of

the port.
                    THE BIVEB MER9EY.                13

The Corporation of Liverpool brought the state of the river under the

special consideration of the late Mr. Huskisson in the year 1828 ; that emi-

nent statesman gave the subject his most serious consideration : he viewed

with alarm the numerous encroachments making, which he considered would,

if allowed to go on, at no very remote period in all probability prove highly
prejudicial to the navigation, and was persuaded that a Commission of Con-

servancy should be without delay appointed, consisting of not more than
three Commissioners, including the Mayor of Liverpool, to be constituted

by Act of Parliament, or by the Crown, reserving to His Majesty the powef

of appointing additional Commissioners if it should hereafter be found ne-

cessary. That his suggestions were fully approved by Lord Lowther, then

Chief Commissioner of Woods and Forests, and by Mr. Arbuthnot, the

Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, appears from the Correspondence

(No. 4). His melancholy death occurred before the business was finally

arranged. And by the reform of corporate bodies, and from other causes,

no effectual measure was taken till the session of the year 1837, when a bill

was brought into Parliament by the Corporation of Liverpool, which was

objected to by Government in consequence of the extensive powers sought

for, and was consequently withdrawn on the understanding that the subject

should be hereafter taken up by the Board of Trade.

   The public bodies most materially interested in the navigation of the
Mersey, are the Mersey and Irwell Navigation, the Duke of Bridgewater's

Canal, the River Weaver Navigation, the Ellesmere Canal, and the Sankey

WeCanal Companies.  have understood that objections have been raised

by some of these companies to the Corporation of Liverpool having a pre-

vailing interest in the conservancy. For the purpose of meeting the wishes

of these most important and highly respectable bodies, and also those

of the influential, commercial, and agricultural interests connected with the

Port of Liverpool, or the River Mersey, we have personally waited on the

Mayor of Manchester and the town authorities of Warrington, and the

gentlemen taking the most prominent part in the management of the Canal

Weand Navigation Companies.  have also seen the Earl of Sefton, the

auditor of the Earl of Derby's estates (both of these noble lords having

considerable estates adjoining the river), Mr. Potts of Chester, on the part

of several landowners on the Cheshire shore, as well as for the Ellesmere

Canal Company, for whom he acts, and other landed proprietors having

Weproperty adjoining the Mersey.  think it proper to annex notes of the

observations made (No. 5), from which it will appear that they all concur
in the propriety of an effective Conservancy being appointed, but some of

them express a strong feeling against the Corporation of Liverpool being

invested with more power than what is given to other public bodies, and the

Mersey and Irwell Company only seemed inclined to contribute to the ex-

pense of the Conservancy.

It is our desire to pay every respect to the opinions of these highly re-

spectable and important companies, and to meet their wishes if possible;

but we cannot lose sight of the correct view taken by the late Mr. Huskis-

son, that if the Conservancy was too numerous it would probably be ineffec-

tive ; and we cannot therefore recommend that the Commission should, in
the first instance, exceed four, though we should much prefer its being

limited to three only, viz. the Mayor of Liverpool for the time being, with

power to nominate one of the Aldermen to act for him in case his public
duties should engage too much of his time ; one of the Dock Trustees,

and one on the part of the public conversant with the state of the river;
--14 REPORT 1856.

to communicate with the Board of Trade on all points affecting the

navigation.

   If it should be considered advisable, a fourth Commissioner may be

--appointed, the Canal and Navigation Companies to make this appoint-

ment from one of their body.
   The Corporation of Liverpool propose to bear two-thirds of the expense,

and the Dock Trustees the other third. The Conservancy can, in our
opinion, only be efficiently formed by a public Act, in which powers may
be given to the Board of Trade for increasing the number of Commissioners,

--if hereafter found necessary; or to commence by a Commission from the

Crown, as suggested by Lord Lowther to Mr. Huskisson, obtaining when
necessary increased powers from Parliament.

   The Conservancy of the River Thames appears to have been first ap-
pointed by charter in the third year of the reign of James L, and after-
wards extended by several Acts of Parliament from the reign of George IIL

We would take the liberty of recommending that tlie powers of the Con-

servators of the Mersey should assimilate, as nearly as circumstances will
admit, to those of the Thames ; and that the shore of the river or of the
sea within the Port of Liverpool should not be vested in them, but should
remain in the Crown, or in other persons legally holding the same, and
should not be taken or used by the Conservators without permission or
purchase. Nor should the Conservators be authorized to interfere with the
extensive enclosures of the marshes above Runcorn, or in the River Weaver,
which are of a very ancient date ; nor with the numerous jetties, chevrons
(unless they are longer than necessary, and obstruct the navigation of the
river), or other encroachments ; but that their operations should, in the
first instance, be confined entirely to the bed of the river, in scouring the
same with proper machinery, and in making new channels and removing

obstructions.

    It is not for Liverpool alone that a Conservancy is wanting, nor for the
Navigation Companies connected with the Mersey : it is of equal importance
to Manchester, and all the other manufacturing towns in Lancashire,
Cheshire, Yorkshire and Staffordshire, and to the general commercial and
shipping interests of the kingdom. If the measure is properly carried into
effect, it will be beneficial to the interests of the community at large.

  We have thought it advisable to request the Corporation of Liverpool to

state their views as to the plan of operations iu the event of Conservancy

being granted.

   The Town Clerk has favoured us with two letters from Lieutenant Lord,

R.N. (No. 2)*, the marine surveyor of the port, to the chairman of the Con-

servancy Committee. He recommends that the lines of high water should

be accurately marked and defined, and that no future encroachments should
be allowed without authority. That the edges of the banks, which in the
upper part of the river are composed of earthy sward, should be protected
by a facing of stone or other suitable material, to prevent any part from
being carried away by the tide. This, he says, would render permanent a
scouring force of water, which would maintain the sea-approaches in an
effective state, and it would then remain to watch the changes that might
arise in the sand-banks in the river and its approaches, and to adopt such

timely remedies as might be necessary. He refers particularly to the dredg-

ing operations which were so successfully carried on for a period of ten
months during the last year, by which means a most valuable channel was

                                                    * Nos. 7 and 8 herewith.
THE RIVER MERSEY.                                                            15

--opened at a small expense ; that its success depended entirely on the

column of water running out of the Mersey on the ebb tide, and to a mi-

nute attention to what was taking place in that region.

   He considers the natural formation of the Mersey admirably adapted for

scouring and keeping open the sea-channels, if encroachments are not

allowed to be made on its banks ; but he doubts the propriety of scarping

or removing rocks.

  We cannot venture to give an opinion as to the most practicable mode of

improving the navigation. The Conservators will (if appointed), as a matter

of course, consult the most eminent engineers as to the best means of

proceeding ; but we think the navigation would be much improved if the

plan of dredging with machinery, so successfully adopted in the Victoria

Channel, was followed up in the river. It is most desirable to make it ap-

parent to the Navigation Companies, to the landowners, and to all other

parties interested, that in appointing a Conservancy the public good only is

looked to, and that there is no intention whatever to interfere with private

interests, which will be duly preserved and protected.

If the President and Lords of the Board of Trade be pleased to approve

of a Conservancy being established by Act of Parliament, we will prepare

a bill founded on the practice in the River Thames for their Lordships'

approval, making special provisions for preserving the rights of the Mersey

and Irwell Company, and those of all other Companies connected with the

River Mersey.

  We also beg to send a statement delivered to us by the Town Clerk of

Liverpool, with a map of the river (Nos.6 and 7), showing the rights of the

Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses to the Lordship of Liverpool, comprising

the River Mersey up to Warrington and Frodsham Bridges, and the Strand

at Liverpool, Toxteth Park, Birkenhead, and Wallasey, which the Corpora-

tion wish to be noticed in our Report ; from which it appears that the

I8th Section of the Act of the 2nd George III. cap. 86, authorizes them as

Trustees of the Docks, by authority from twenty- five of their body, to re-

move such nuisances as may be necessary for improving, scouring, and

keeping open the navigation from the sea as far southwards as the Lordship

extends; and by the Dock Acts of the 39th George III. cap. 59. sec. 29,

and 57 George III. cap. l^S. sec. 80, their water-bailiff and harbour-master

have special powers over vessels, wrecks, and obstructions. It would there-

fore seem that Parliament intended to give powers to the Corporation

which are not considered sufficient to constitute an efficient Conservancy.

                       We have the honour to be, Sir,

Your most obedient Servants,

--Sheweth, That your Memorialists, as representing the town and being

the owners of the Lordship of Liverpool, comprising the Port, are most

materially interested in the maintenance, preservation, and improvement of

navigation of the River Mersey.

That the entrance to the River Mersey is by three principal channels,

formed in the midst of numerous sand-banks and shoals, frequently shifting

and increasing.

That in other parts of the river there are dangerous banks and shoals,

and that in particular extensive banks have formed opposite the entrance of

the docks, threatening the most dangerous consequences.

--18 REPORT 1856.

That for years past the general state of the river has been most critical

and alarming.

That the principal causes of this state of the river are, as your Memorialists

believe, the impediments oflered to the flux and reflux of the tidal waters

and the diminution of water space above the town, by the enclosure from the

river of large tracts of land.

   That your Memorialists have for many years vainly endeavoured to obtain

some eflScient protection for their own and the public interests in the vesting

of the conservancy of the river in commissioners with adequate powers, your

Memorialists fearing that unless vigorous measures were adopted, the Mersey

would become, like the Dee, the Lune, the Exe, and many other rivers, no

longer navigable for vessels of burden.

That your Memorialists, from the year 1818 to the present time, have, at a

very heavy expense, caused frequent surveys and reports upon the state of

the river to be made, namely, in 1818 by the late Mr. Whidbey, the con-

structor of the breakwater at Plymouth (v/hose Report contains a concise

and clear view of the then state of the river, and of the deterioration to be

anticipated from the causes before mentioned); in 1822 by the same gen-

tleman in conjunction with the late Messrs. Chapman and John Rennie; in

1823 by Messrs. Telford, Nimmo, Whidbey, Chapman, Rennie, and Fowler;

in 1826 by Mr. Whidbey and Messrs. George Rennie and Giles; in 1827 by

Messrs. George Rennie and Giles, and afterwards by Messrs. James Walker

and W.   C. Mylne;  in  1828  by Messrs.  Telford,  Stevenson, and  Nimmo                                     in
                                                                                                           ;

1835 by Mr. George Rennie; in 1836 by Commander Denham, R.N. ; and

in 1837 by Messrs. Mylne and George Rennie and Walker.

That these Reports prove in the most unquestionable manner the

absolute necessity for active and incessant superintendence, and they also

incontestably prove the changeable ciiaracter of the river and its ap-

proaches.

   That in the beginning of the Session of last year a Bill was brought into
the House of Commons to empower the proprietors of the Grand Junction

Railway to amend their present line, by forming a new line of railway by

crossing the River Mersey three to four miles below the town of Warrington,

by a bridge at a place called Fidler's Ferry.

That your Memorialists, fully sensible of the importance of the proposed

measure, were with great reluctance compelled to offer to it all the oppo-

sition in their power, inasmuch as the proposed bridge would have been

injurious to the trade and navigation on the river, and would have interfered

with the flux and reflux of the tide.

That this Bill was rejected in committee so far as related to the intended

bridge.

That your Memorialists on this occasion off'ered evidence as to the past

and present state of the river.

That from the evidence thus given, your Memorialists have extracted

portions comprising part of the Reports already referred to, which they lay

before your Lordships, and to which they earnestly and respectfully solicit

your attention.

That one statement in particular proved before the committee was as

follows :

   " The present area of the River Mersey, from the Black Rock at the mouth

to Woolston Weir above Warrington Bridge, is 23,062 acres, over which, at

a 22-feet tide, 736,94'5,215 tons of water flow, and that no less than 13,440

acres of marshes have been abstracted from the tideway, equal to about

25,000,000 tons of water, calculated at the same tide. That the remaining
                                       --

                            THE RIVER MERSEY.                        19

salt marshes were, about the year 1822, only 1897 acres, from which further
abstractions have since been made."

   That in further corroboration of your Memorialists' representation, they
lay before your Lordships the following Report of Lieutenant Lord, R.N.,
the Marine Surveyor of the Dock Trustees :

                                                                    " Marine Surveyor's Office, February 1839.

My" attention having been called to the fluctuations going on from time

to time on the banks and shores of the Mersey and its embouchure, I beg to

state that all those conversant with the navigable channels of the river are

aware that frequent and sometimes very sudden changes take place in the

sand-banks and navigable waters of the same. That such fluctuations are

going on continually is strongly evidenced by the Marine Surveyor's Report

in 1836, by which it appears that between the years 1828 and 1886 the

horizontal increase of Pluckington Bank was 210 yards abreast of Brunswick

Basin, 123 abreast of King's Dock, and 40 abreast of Duke's Dock ; and that
between the years 1834 and 1836 it had grown up one foot at Brunswick

Dock, two feet off Brunswick Basin, three feet ofl" King's Dock, three feet

off Duke's Dock, and one foot off Canning Dock; whilst its lower water

margin yielded 50 yards during the same period. Thus threatening to be-

come a serious obstruction to the entrance of Brunswick, King's, and Duke's

Dock.

" It also appears from the same statements, that the Devil's Bank and Spit

had considerably elongated during the above period.

" In a remoter region, namely, the sand-banks at the entrance of the port,

such as the Great and Little Burbo, Jordan Flats, &c., the changes have been

still greater, as was fully evinced in the survey carried on last summer, as

compared with that of 1835.

   " In no part is this more strongly exemplified than in the Half-tide Swash-

way and the New Channel.

" In the former the Old Channel has filled, leaving a dry bank at low water,

and another channel has scoured itself where we had formerly a dry bank;

whilst in the New Channel there has been a gradual warping and filling

up for the last four years, leaving now a navigable channel of only 130

fathoms wide, with 1 1 feet at low water, where we formerly had a channel

half a mile wide with 12 and 13 feet.

" Taylor's Bank has also considerably spread to the north-west during the

above interval, and various other alterations have taken place in the contour

and altitude of the banks.

" In conclusion, I would state it to be my conviction that the encroachment

on the bed of the river, by the reclaiming of land, &c. at its upper part, cannot

be too strongly deprecated, as it must evidently diminish tiie backwater, on

the scouring effects of which the very vitality of the entrances to the port

depends, besides altering and diverting the stream of the river into new and

often injurious channels.

                             " I have the honour, &c.,  " W. Lord."

   That your Memorialists, in the language of their late lamented representa-
tive the Right Honourable William Huskisson, " feel convinced, from facts

and personal observation, that if the system of encroachment and nuisance
which has prevailed for many years in the Mersey is not effectually checked,

so as to give full scope for the natural flux and reflux of the tidal waters,

the Port of Liverpool will, in the course of no very long time, be as much
choked up as those of Chester and Lancaster now are."

   Your Memorialists therefore, iu conclusion, earnestly urge on the attention

                                                                         c2

of your Lordships the necessity for immediate measures for the future pro-
tection of the navigation of the River Mersey, an object of increasing and
anxious interest to your Memorialists, and one in which the eountry at large
is deeply concerned.

   And your Memorialists will ever pray, &c.

 Liverpool, April 1839.

                                 Second Memorial, September 1839.

 To the Honourable the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, and to the

      Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners for the Affairs of Trade.

    The Memorial of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of the Borough

                                                       of Liverpool,

    Sheweth,--That your Memorialists presented in May last, through the

 members of the borough, a Memorial to your Lordships, setting forth the dan-
 gerous state of the River Mersey, from the numerous and shifting banks and
 shoals, the causes for this state, the endeavours hitherto ineffectually made to

  obtain efficient protection, the necessity for incessant superintendence, the

 immense area already abstracted from the tideway, and other grounds, as
  inducements for the interference of your Lordships, in order to the establish-
  ment of a Commission of Conservancy ; which ?rIemorial was accompanied by
 extracts of evidence taken before a Committee of the House of Commons in
  the session of 1838, in the Grand Junction Railway Bill, as to the past and

  present state of the river.
      That your Memorialists are anxious to receive the opinion of your Lord-

  ships upon the prayer of their Memorial, and (venturing to assume that a
  Bill to be brought into Parliament in the ensuing session will be directed or
  sanctioned by your Lordships) more particularly as to the preliminary ques-
  tion, whether such Bill ought to be public or private, inasmuch as in case
  the latter be deemed by your Lordships to be preferable, tiie necessary notices
   must be forthwith given, and other parliamentary proceedings be taken in
   conformity to the standing orders ; and, as whatever course of proceeding
  your Lordships may recommend, immediate meetings with parties concerned,
  proprietors along the banks of the river, ought to be held, in order as much
   as possible to remove misunderstanding and consequent hostility on their

    parts.

       That your Memorialists would respectfully urge on your Lordships' con-
   sideration, that the plan of a public bill would be the preferable course ; for
   even the notice of a private bill, and the deposit of maps showing a line of
   causeway along, or, as many would suppose, over estates on the banks of the
    Mersey, creates such alarm in the minds of the proprietors interested, as to
   make it exceedingly difficult and almost impossible afterwards to explain
    that the proposed measure is one for the public good, and for the benefit
    rather than to the injury of individuals.

        That your Memorialists have, through their officers, lately had the advan-
   tage of conferences with Mr. Wilkin, one of the officers of the Woods and
    Forests, and with Mr. Wilkin, junior, both lately dispatched by that Board
    to Liverpool, at the instance of your Lordships, to take preliminary steps on
    the subject of the Conservancy ; and your Memorialists believe that these
    gentlemen, who have given considerable attention to the subject, and have
    taken great interest therein, concur in opinion with your Memorialists and
    their officers, that a public bill is the proper measure to be recommended,
    but that, however that point may be determined, another session ought not

to pass over without a bill, public or private, being brought into Par-

liament.

   Your Memorialists therefore pray the immediate consideration and direc-
tion of your Lordships on the matters submitted.

--No. 5. Letter from H. M. Denham, R.N., to the Corporation of Liverpool,

                                            27th September, 1836.

                                                          Marine Surveyor's Office, Liverpool, Sept. 27, 1836,

  -- --Sir, Pursuant to a request to the following effect, " That I would

furnish a plan of that part of the river opposite the property of Mr. Lace
and others, and a report and statement of the variation in Pluckington

--Bank and the adjacent parts," I took every opportunity afforded by the

tides and M'eather to produce the results set forth in this report and the ac-
companying plans, which will evidence how necessarily the question involved
an actual re-survey of the whole region between the Rock Lighthouse and
where the river ceases to be navigable at low water, viz. Garston and
Eastham ; for on no less datum than the most recent tests as to the causes
and effects of the river's deflection could I presume to give an opinion, which,
on the one hand, might involve capita! already embarked in projections, or,
on the other, incite the sanction of its conservators as respects those projec-
tions. I can, however, now assert, that so distant is the primary cause and
impetus of the river's deflection (on its eastern margin) from those projections
between Knott's Hole or Dingle Point and the southern extremity of the
Dock Estate, as to entirely absolve the works of Messrs. Lace and others
from any ill effects.

    Provided, that it be a sine qua non such jetties shall be subject to a
boundary-line on the strand, laterally with the low-water margin as deline-
ated on the Plan, such line to constitute the face of all projections, and
(until connected with the shelving rocks at Dingle Point) to have 100 yards
of face wall always at right angles to the southward of the southernmost

offset.

    In this stipulation it will appear that I admit the deflecting effect of any
offsets upon the ebb stream, although north of Dingle Point. So I do ; but
it is so slight, in comparison with the position and continuous diversion of
that point, that if we abstain from interrupting the downset of the recover-
ing water-level (feeble as it is) after rounding Dingle Point, by direct off-
sets, then we shall direct that feeble portion of stream ya^V/y and beneficially
down the face of the docks.

    Thus much. Sir, applies to the question of Mr. Lace's projection, or any

others in the limits quoted.

    I now beg to report on the nature of Pluckington and Devil's Banks ; to
elucidate which, I submit a plan of the features of the river between the
Rock Lighthouse and Garston, upon four inches to the mile, whereon the
 course and velocity of the flood and ebb stream are portrayed, the former
 in red and the latter in blue ink, showing that Pluckington owes nothing to
 the flood-tide deposit, but that on the course of the eastern column of the
 ebb does that deposit depend, and that course depends on Dingle Point; for
 by practical tests on each half-hour of ebb from high to low water, we
 perceive its inclination to follow the trend of shore until within 100 yards
 of Dingle Point, which becomes so decidedly the point of deflection, as to
 hurry it into the deep-water column with such impetus as to blend with it,
 and divert the whole obliquely towards Birkenhead, whereby the tidal stream
                                                      --

^ --REPORT 1856.

off the southern portion of docks, especially King's, Queen's, and Brunswick
"Docks, becomes so weakened as to permit the sand held in solution to deposit
thereat, besides being too weak to bear away the silt driven forth from the
 several dock sluices. The first effect of this diversion manifests itself in
 the formation of a shelf of sand varying from three to ten feet under water,
 that springs from abreast of the rocks under Mr. Lawrence's wall one-third
 of a mile southward of the Potteries, trending obliquely towards Birkenhead
.until abreast of the southern extremity of the Dock Estate, where it forms an
 elbow one-third of a mile towards the centre of the river, and then trends
 to St. George's Dock. This shelf, therefore, narrows the river capacity at
 low water to nearly one-half what it appears to be at Rock Ferry and
 Brunswick Dock, and then the visible Pluckington springing obliquely from
 the southern extremity of the Dock Estate, and forming an entrance off
 Brunswick off-tide entrance at an offset of 270 yards into the river, whence
 it trends into St. George's Dock, lateral to and within thirty yards of the

 margin of the shelf.
    This bank outlays King's Dock Basin also 270 yards, varying from six

 feet to one foot in height above low-water level. Its highest part is off
 Duke's Dock, where it outlays fifty yards less, but drives up ten feet ; off

 Canning Dock it outlays above 120 yards, and drives up to six feet four

 inches, then gradually narrows at an elevation of two feet, until uniting with

 the base of George's Pier-head.
     Taking the progress of this bank since 1828, which is marked by a green

 shade on Plan, we have a horizontal increase of 210 yards abreast of Bruns-
 wick Basin, abreast of King's Dock 123 yards, and abreast of Duke's Dock
 only 40 yards. Its respective elevations I cannot quote between those dates,
 but since 1834, I find it grown up one foot off Brunswick Dock, two feet
 off Brunswick Basin, three feet off King's Dock, three feet off Duke's Dock,
 and one foot off Canning Dock, during which its low-water margin has
 yielded fifty yards directly off Brunswick Basin. Simultaneous with this
 two years' fluctuation, I find the Devil's Bank to have warped 143 yards

 towards the eastern shore, lowered in altitude four feet, but elongated

 towards Pluckington Shelf 250 yards, so that the spit of Devil's Bank and

  Pluckington Shelf are within a quarter of a mile of uniting with each other,
  an event to be feared, seeing that the Devil's Spit has elongated two-thirds of
 a mile in eight years, but which should be averted with all anxiety ; for on
 the space between them being shoaled up to a bar of six feet instead of

 fifteen, the Garston branch of the Mersey will scour its way through the
 Swatchway just above Otterspool, dividing the Devil's Bank from Eastham
 Sands, and join the main column of ebb stream down the Cheshire side of

  the river. I therefore earnestly propose, that, with reference to the curvi-

 lineal boundary set forth for the future projections between the Dock Estate

 and Dingle Point, a river-wall should be extended in connexion from forty
 yards within the low-water edge of the Knott's Hole rocks, scraping the
 edge of those rocks, and preserving a gentle concave along the low-water
 margin of the shore. This wall would produce a most sensible effect on
 the first 400 yards' advance, by presenting a cutwater edge to the down
 stream, instead of allowing the whole body of water to drive against the
 north cliffs and rocks of Dingle Point, and then jerked off with an impo-
 verished impetus at nearly right angles to its wonted and natural course.

     Its further extension might be subject of convenience of funds, &c., under-
 standing that as it progressed south-eastward, more decided guidance and
 impetus on the ebb stream would be afforded, the destructive undermining
 of the cliffs and consequent dissemination thereof on the banks obviated,
                   и

a░d much valuable frontage redeemed; for, supposing it carried up to
Otterspool, an area of 616 acres would be produced ; and if up to Garston,
1590 acres.

   The Jillifig up would not concern our tidal object ; on the contrary, the
circulation of water within would avoid the displacement of 2,702,018 cubic
yards of tidal water in first enclosure to Otterspool, and 72,000,000 in the
whole enclosure. The contemplated enclosure between the Dock Estate and
Dingle Point will embrace 346 acres area, and 11,024,444 cubic yards of
water, for the total of which displacement I should not be tenacious of per-
mitting of a close wall and filling up the strand within it, notwithstanding
the assumed obvious advantage to property.

   I will conclude this Report, Sir, by begging it may go hand in hand with

the local and general Plans herewith submitted for elucidation to the mind's
eye of those gentlemen concerned in the conservation of the Mersey and

Dock approaches. Of the latter it need only be said, that, whilst placing

dock sills between four and nine feet of low-water level, a bank should be
contemplated with much jealousy that not only precludes taking up early
anchorage near the Southern Docks, but that threatens to elevate itself
above the level of those sills, except in the guttering course of the gate

sluices.

   I ought to add, that we need not wait the connexion of a boundary wall
from the Docks to Dingle Point before striking out the eutivater wall south-
ward, but act independently and effectively by Dingle Point, by first project-
ing on the rocks 100 yards in a south-west direction, and then vigorously

working towards Otterspool.

                                          Your obedient Servant,

6--No. Statement of the Town Clerk as to the Rights of the Mayor,

   Aldermen, and Burgesses of Liverpool to the Lordship of Liverpool, com-
   prising the River Mersey up to the Bridges and to the Strand at Liver-

   pool, Toxteth Park, Birkenhead, and Wallasey.

   1. The title of the Corporation to the Lordship of Liverpool, comprising
                              the River Mersey up to the Bridges,

   The Corporation, as purchasers from the grantees of King Charles the
First, are seized in fee of the town and lordship of Liverpool, and all the
customs, anchorage, and key or keel towl of the water of the Mersey, of
which over the whole of the river up to the Warrington and Frodsham
Bridges the Corporation are, and ever since their purchase have been, in the
receipt and enjoyment. The lordship comprises the river up to the bridges.

   By the Liverpool Dock Act, 2 Geo. IIL c. 86. s. 18, the Corporation, as

--" the Trustees of the Liverpool Docks," have the following express powers :

   " And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that it shall and
may be lawful to and for the said trustees, their agents, servants or work-
men, when and as often as occasion shall require, well and sufficiently to

cleanse, scour, open, deepen, widen or straighten, rake up or cut through
any banks, shoals, flats, shallows, dock sluices or guts in the said harbour of
Liverpool, or leading into the same from the sea, as the same trustees, or
any twenty-five or more of them, shall think proper and necessary for the
--24 REPORT 1856.

better securing, maintaining, and preserving a free, open and perfect navi-
gation into and through the said harbour of Liverpool, and to dig, cut, re-
move and take away any sand, gravel, rocks, stones, anchors, cables, timber
and other things, wrecks of ships, or other vessels, or any other obstructions
 or impediments to the navigation leading into and being within the said
 harbour of Liverpool from the sea or mouth of the said harbour, and so far
 southwards as the liberties or lordship of the Corporation of Liverpool ex-
 tend, be it the ground or soil of the King's Most Excellent Majesty or any
 other person or persons, bodies politic or corporate, whatsoever."

  2. The property of the Corporation in the Strand at Liverpool and part of
                                                   Toxteth Park.

     The Corporation of Liverpool are the owners of the freehold of the whole
 of the strand, forming the river front of the ancient borough, such owner-
 ship so far as respects the docks now standing vested in them in their
 capacity of " the Trustees of the Liverpool Docks," by virtue of appropria-
 tions under the Dock Acts. As to the small dock of the Trustees of the late
 Duke of Bridgewater, that property, with certain limited privileges over the
  strand, is leasehold for lives, with a right of perpetual renewal on payment
  of a small fixed fine, the Corporation still owning the freehold in reversion.
 Of the title of the Corporation there is, from 1670 downwards, the strongest
  proofs, by grants, leases, and various other acts of ownership, as in 1828

 was fully admitted by the Duchy of Lancaster, Mr. Wyndham then being the
  Duchy Solicitor. Upon this occasion extracts from the Corporation Records,

  with three explanatory maps, were laid before the Duchy.
     Of the strand in Toxteth Park, so far as the Liverpool Docks extend into

  that toM'nship or extra-parochial place, the Corporation, principally in their
  capacity of " the Trustees of the Liverpool Docks," are also the owners of

  the freehold by purchases from Lord Sefton and others under the Dock

   Acts.

     The docks of the trustees and the river-walls were all made under acts of

   Parliament.

          3. The property of the Corporation in Birkenhead and Wallasey,

      The Corporation by purchases are entitled to their land at Birkenhead
  and Wallasey in fee, with the rights of the lords of the manors to the shore
  of the Mersey. The only erections (called by Mr. Eyes encroachments)
  made since the purchases of the Corporation are parts of the public road,
   viz. where that road crosses Gill Brook, and where it crosses Bridge End,
   and one other erection, the unauthorized act of a tenant. All the other
  erections on the shore were made by prior owners.

   --Sir, Referring to those points to which it is most desirable the attention

   of the Conservative Commissioners of the River Mersey should be primarily
   directed in the event of conservative powers being obtained from Parlia-
   ment, I would premise, that the existence and maintenance of the sea chan-
   nels leading to the port, vitally depend on the preservation of the back-
   water which the Mersey and its tributary streams afford ; that this body of
THE RIVER MERSEY.  25

water is liable to daily diminution by various encroachments, and, if not
protected, will be materially lessened, the effect of which would undoubtedly
be, the sanding and filling up of the sea channels, leading ultimately to the

ruin of the port.

   The first object therefore worthy the attention of the conservators, would,
in my opinion, be the preservation of the backwater as it at present exists,
and to take care that for the future it was not trenched on or diminished.

   To effect this object, it would, I think, be desirable that the limits of the
high-water margin of the river should be accurately marked and defined,
and that no subsequent encroachment should be allowed on the bed of the

river, either in the shape of reclaiming land from its banks, or by allow-
ing any projections into the stream of the river without the sanction of the

Commissioners.
    It is a well-known fact, that considerable encroachments have in former

times been made on the bed of the Mersey by the reclaiming of land in the

upper part of the river, and such operations cannot, in my opinion, be too
strongly deprecated ; and I may here add, that it is to this very cause, viz.

the enclosure of land in its upper part, that the filling up of the channels in
the estuary of the Dee is very generally attributed.

    Having defined the high-water limits, it would, I think, be very desirable
that the edges of the banks (which in the upper part of the river are com-
posed of an earthy sward) should be protected by a facing of stone or other
suitable material ; the destructive fretting away and undermining of their
margins and consequent dissemination thereof on the banks in the river, and
its embouchure, would thus be obviated.

    Having thus secured and rendered permanent a scouring force of water
equal to that we now possess, and which there is every reason to believe is
capable of maintaining the sea-approaches of the port in as effective a state
as they now exist, it would only remain to carefully and vigilantly watch the
changes that might arise from time to time in the sand-banks in the river and
its approaches, and should circumstances render it necessary, adopt such
timely remedial measures as the urgency of the case or the operations of
nature might suggest. I may here remark, that the dredging operations
which were so successfully carried on during a period of ten months last
year in the Victoria Channel, and by means of which a most valuable chan-
nel was opened to the port, depended for their success entirely on the column
of water running out of the Mersey on the ebb tide, and a minute attention
to the changes which were naturally taking place in that region; and should
any future fluctuations take place in that or other quarters, it may again
become requisite to adopt artificial measures to improve or preserve the
approaches to the port.

   The natural formation of the River Mersey is, I think, admirably adapted
for the purpose of scouring and keeping open the sea channels, provided
that formation is not altered and distorted by encroachments on its banks.
The upper part of the river, between the Dingle Point and Weston Point,
forms as it were an immense inland lake of eleven miles long by two and a
half broad, the latter being the average width between Eastham and Garston,
and Dungeon Point and the Cheshire shore. At the Dingle Point the river
contracts, and between the Cheshire shore and Liverpool, from the south to
the north end of the docks, it constitutes a narrow gorge of only half a mile
width and considerable depth, through Avhich the calculated waters of the
upper lake are disgorged with a velocity of as much as seven miles per hour
on the ebb tide ; and though it is true that this impetus is materially dimi-
nished by the time it reaches the sea at the outer bars of the shallows, still
--26 REPORT 1856.

if we can preserve the same column of water and strength of current which
we now possess, I see no reason to apprehend the outer approaches of the

port sanding or tilling up.

   The scarping, or removal of rocks, in the river should not, I think, be
undertaken without due consideration of the effects likely to be produced
by so doing, and should, in my opinion, be avoided as much as possible.

   In conclusion, I would beg to remark, that I think the new dock proposed
to be formed to the westward of the Salthouse Dock, and the carrying out

of the river-wail in that quarter, so as to form a continuous line with the

other docks, will be a great and decided improvement to the navigation of

the river.

            I am, Sir, your obedient Servant,

                                   (Signed)         Wm. Lord,

                                             Marine Surveyor to the Port.

To the Chairman of the Conservarwy Committee.

No. 8.--Letter from Lieut. Wm. Lord to R. Radcliffe, Esq.

                                                                           Marine Surveyor's Office, April 3, 1840.

  --Dear Sir, Since I last wrote to you on the Conservancy affairs, it has

occurred to me that two or three piers judiciously run out between Garston

and the Dingle Point, might produce a good effect in preventing the great
oflPset of the tide from the Dingle Point, and conducting it along the line
of the docks, by which some portion of Pluckington Bank would doubtless

be got rid of.

   Havine had some conversation with the Dock Surveyor on the subject,
I may ad"d that he fully concurs with me on this matter, which may be
worthy the attention of the Conservancy Commissioners, should such be

appointed.

   The expense of the erection of such piers would not, I apprehend, be

very great.                        I am, dear Sir,

   R. Radcliffe, Esq., Town Hall.              Yours very truly,

                                   (Signed)         Wm. Lord.

Report upon the changes in the Sea Channels of the Mersey, as recorded by
   the Surveys tahen and published within the last fifty years ; and which
   surveys have been laid before the Committee appointed to iiivestigate and
   report upon the same, by the British Association for the Advancement of

   Science, at its meeting in Liverpool, September 1854. By Joseph Boult.

   The charts of the Mersey having been usually prepared when important
changes had taken place in the channels, the investigations of those changes
could not be arranged by epochs of time, and therefore the periods which

the charts themselves prescribe have been adopted.

   For the purpose of this inquiry it may be conveniently assumed that the
true mouths of the river are at the outward extremities of the sea channels.
The streams of tide running inland through these sea channels unite into one
great stream between the north dock-works of Liverpool and New Brighton.

After passing the towns of Liverpool and Birkenhead, through a narrow

--gorge which in places is as much as 10 or 12 fathoms deep, at low water
THE RIVER MERSEY.  27

--of ordinary spring tides the river rapidly widens into a very extensive reach

 or reservoir, soinetimes called the upper estuary ; from which the tide, after
 sending an offshoot into the Weaver, passes into the upper reaches of the
 river through the smaller gorge of Runcorn-gap. After traversing a series
 of reaches and gorges of less and less importance, and surmounting a low
 weir at Howley-Ioeks (Warrington), its further progress is finally barred by
 the Woolston-weir of the Mersey and Irwell navigation. This weir is about

 four miles above Warrington ; twenty-two miles above the Rock Point, New

 Brighton ; and thirty-four miles above the bar of the Victoria Channel.
     In the first instance, the phsenomena of the upper estuary, and those of the

\nter estuary or Liverpool Bay, may be most conveniently considered apart;

 the results of their investigation can afterwards be combined.

  --Liverpool Bay. The earliest authentic survey of Liverpool Bay, published

 within the period assigned to this inquiry, is that of Captain George Thomas,

 R.N., which was taken in 181S, and published in May 1815. The next

 authentic survey is that of Captain H. M. Denham, R.N., in 1833. Both
 these surveys were made by order of the Admiralty, in consequence of the
 great anxiety and alarm experienced by the local authorities, arising from

 the important changes which took place in the channels prior to each of the

 above dates.

  --The changes of the later period continuing, they were in fact the precur-
--sors of the substitution of new outlets for the old ones, the surveys were

 repeated by Captain Denham, in 1835 and 1837.

  --North Channel. On comparing the charts of 1813 and 1833, it appears

 that at the former date the Northern Channel, which Avas previously divided
into two portions, called the Crosby and the Formby Channels, maintained
an even course until it had passed Crosby Point, where it separated into two
outlets; one over a bar, with from one to eight feet of water, into the old
Formby Channel, in which were from one and three-quarters to six fathoms;
and thence over another bar seaward with from one to eight feet of water.
The other outlet, called the South Channel, was to the southward and west-
ward, and passed between the Jordan and Great Burbo Banks, having from
two to six fathoms, diminishing on a seaward bar to 7 feet. In this survey
Formby Bank is insulated and covered at four hours' tiood.

  --Formby Bank. In 1833, twenty years later, Formby Bank had attached

itself to the main shore ; and the old Formby Channel was almost land-locked,
and had no communication with the Crosby Channel, except over a 6-foot
bar, between Jordan and Formby Banks. The depth of water on the seaward
bar of this channel had increased in places to 13 feet.

  --New Channel. The South Channel of Thomas's survey appears to have

shifted upwards of a mile to the southward, and acquired nearly a true east
and west bearing ; and had a bar with 10 or 11 feet of water. It was called

by Denham the New C'iannel.

  --Zebra Channel- Between the Formby Channel and the New Channel

another outlet was opened, having a minimum depth of 2 I'eet, and called the

Half-tide Swatchway, or Zebra Channel.

  --Mad Wliarf. Mad Wharf, a large bank adjoining Formby Point to the

northward, had elongated upwards of 2200 yards in that direction, and its

area considerably enlarged.

   Many changes took place in the position and magnitude of the minor

banks adjoining the seaward entrance of the Northern Channel ; some of

which, as the "middle patch," nearly disappeared ; whilst others enlarged

their area, or sprang altogether into existence.

  --Victoria Channel, Between the survey of 1833 and those of 1835 and
                --;

--28 REPORT 1856.

1837, the differences chiefly consist of the changes which accompanied the

partly natural and partly artificial formation or readjustment of the new-

channels ; they found their issue in the formation of that which is known as

the Victoria Channel.
-- AWest Channel.
                       similar examination of the Western Channel, divided

into two portions called the Rock and the Horse Channels, will show the

--following changes.
   Rock Channel. In the above-named period of twenty years the banks
north of the Rock Channel were enlarged and consolidated ; the Brazil Bank
and Burbo Sand were united to the Great Burbo Bank, and the patch, which
at the earlier date divided the Rock Channel at its junction with the river
into two portions, was itself divided, and one piece added to Burbo Sand, the

other to the main shore.
   At the western extremity of the Rock Channel, near its junction with the

Horse Channel, its width has been contracted about 400 yards ; the accretions
are partially on Dove Spit, but chiefly on the western point of Great Burbo,
now called the North Spit. At the bar of the Rock Channel, Thomas gives
soundings of one-third fathom (or 2 feet) seaward, and of one and two-third

fathom (or 10 feet) on the Liverpool side. In 1833 Denham gives 2 feet

on the bar, and 3 feet on the Liverpool side, showing a diminution of 7 feet

in the latter.

   Denham's soundings are unaltered in 1837.

  --Hoylahe. In 1689, the date of Captain CoUins's survey, the big ships put

out part of their lading in Hoylake, that they might sail over the flats into
Liverpool ; at that time the depth of water in the lake ranged from two and
a half fathoms to seven fathoms, and William III. was able to embark his
army for Ireland. 1 24 years afterwards, Thomas records the range as reduced
from one fathom to four fathoms ; and twenty years later it appears upon
Denham's first chart as closed by a bar, the pools on either side of the bar

having been reduced in width to about one-half of that of the lake in

1813.
   Hoylake joined the W^estern Channel at the junction of the Horse and

--Rock Channels.
   Horse Channel, Whilst these changes have taken place, the direction of
the Horse Channel has been slightly varied by additions to the north-eastern

--extremity of East Hoyle Bank.
   Dock Extensions. 1803 to 1836. According to information obligingly
furnished by Mr. J. B. Hartley, one of the engineers to the Committee of the
Liverpool Docks, the works constructed between 1803 and 1836 comprised
the Prince's Dock and Basin ; the Waterloo, Victoria, and Trafalgar Docks ;
the Clarence Dock ; the Clarence Graving Dock and Clarence Half-tide
Dock, and the Salisbury Dock, northwardly ; the widening of the George's
and King's Piers, and the construction of the Manchester Basin, Canning
Half-tide Dock, and Albert Dock, centrally ; and the widening of the Queen's
Pier and the construction of the Eagle Basin and river craft dock, the Union,
Coburg, and Brunswick Docks, the Brunswick Graving Docks, the Brunswick
Half-tide Dock, and the Dockyard, southwardly ; and the space abstracted
from the river by these works comprised an area of about 156 acres.

  --These works have been almost entirely constructed since 1813.

    Meteorological PhcBnomena. There are no reliable meteorological obser-
vations of the period 1813 to 1837. The following notices of storms of
wind and rain are compiled from the annals appended to Gore's Directory

of Liverpool :

had been experienced for many years. The sewer in the Old Dock burst,

and carried several yards of wall into the dock. August.

 --1830. Alarming thunder-storm, with heavy rain ; much damage in White-

  A storm more severe than that of November 29th, much more property

being destroyed. The tide rose fromlihe proper height of 17 feet 5 inches

to 26 feet ; the piers and wharves were overflowed, and much damage was

done to the public works, north and south. December 31.
--1834. Violent gale on the night of Sunday, December 7.

During a severe gale, the ' Heyes,' for Barbadoes, and the ' Febo,' for

Palermo, were lost; and the ' Sandbach' and several other vessels got on
shore ; several pilots were taken to sea. December 22nd and 23rd.

   Since 1837 the surveys of Liverpool Bay have been conducted by Lieu-
tenant Lord, R.N., lately marine surveyor to the Dock Committee; they

were published in the years 1840, 1846, 1849, 1852, 1853, and 1854.

 --Northern Channel. 1840. On comparing the survey of 1840 with that

of its immediate predecessor of 1837, it will be seen that the Northern
Channel had undergone important changes. They were as follows :

  --Crosby Channel. The length and direction of that portion of the Crosby

Channel which lies between the Rock Lighthouse and the Crosby Light-
vessel had been very slightly altered ; and its area had remained very much
                                                                   --;

--30 REPORT 1856.

the same as in 1837 ; but the average depth had been reduced from 31 feet

to 30 feet.

Between the Crosby and Forinby Light-vessels the direction of the channel

had undergone considerable alteration, the Formby vessel, in 1840, having

been moved nearly 600 yards westward ; the area and depth increased, the

former from 15,600 yards to 17,500 yards, and the latter from 26^ feet to
27 feet. The average of the whole channel from the Rock Lighthouse to
Formby Light-vessel being an area slightly increased, and a depth sta-

tionary.

  --Victoria Cha7inel. The change in the direction of this channel had been

very great; the Bell Buoy, which indicates its entrance from the sea, having

been moved, in 1840, nearly 2000 yards to the north of its position in 1837.
The depth of water on the bar iiad been reduced from 12 feet and 13 feet

to 10 feet and 11 feet.

    Zebra Channel This channel had been advanced to the westward of its
former position, and had increased its minimum depth from 2 feet to 3 feet

on the fairway track.

 --Formby Bank. This bank had been slightly moved to the eastward, and

considerably elongated to the northward, the elevation of its surface much

more varied, some portions having been considerably higher and others

lower than they were in 1837 ; the elongated portion may be specially noted
as having been entirely "wash." On the whole, however, the volume of the

bank appears to have been diminished nearly one-third ; the cubic contents
of the bank, in 1837, having been nearly 10,000,000 yards, and in 1840

Mad --rather more than 6,500,000 yards.
             Wharf. In this bank there had been little change.
  --Great Burbo. The area of this bank had been enlarged, and its volume

--increased from about 58,500,000 yards to about 62,000,000 yards.
    Western Channel. The eastern portion of this channel, called the Rock

Channel, had been reduced in length about 500 yards, and in average depth

1 foot; its area had been reduced about 580 yards, making the average loss

on the three years equal to 6 per cent, per annum.
   The depth of water on the bar reduced from 2 feet to 1 foot; and the first

sounding on the Liverpool side of the bar from 3 fee t to 2 feet.

   The sailing direction of the Horse 'Channel remained unaltered ; but the
North-west Light-vessel at the seaward entrance of the channel had been

--removed in 1840 about 250 yards north of its position in 1837.
   East Hoyle. The bar in Hoylake, forming part of this bank, had in-

creased in area, and grown up to 2 feet and 3 feet above low-water level

but, notwithstanding this accession, the area and altitude of this bank had

been diminished; and its volume reduced from nearly 81,250,000 yards

--to rather more than 73,500,000 yards.
   Dock Extension. No works of importance were constructed during the

--period under investigation.
   Meteorological Phenomena. In the continued absence of recorded sci-

entific observations, reference is again made to the precarious information

in ' Gore's Annals,' from which the following notices are compiled :

--AWest Hoyle during a gale; all on board perished. April 17.
1839.        terrific and most destructive hurricane visited Liverpool on the

evening of January 6, and continued with little intermission till the following
afternoon. The destruction of life and property was very great; and there

was scarcely a part of the town in which some fatal accident did not occur.
The loss of life amongst the shipping was awful. The North-west Lightship

was driven from her moorings and brought into port. Two New York

packets, outward bound, were lost upon the North Bank (part of the Great
Burbo, in the Rock Channel). The ' Brighton,' from Bombay, was wrecked
near the Middle Patch Buoy, in the same channel. The ' Harvest Home,'

--from St. Thomas, was lost on Mad Wharf.
   Northern Channel. 1846. Between the years ISiO and 1846 consider-
able changes had occurred, though, on the whole, less remarkable than those
which took place between the years 1837 and 1840.

  --Crosby Channel. That portion between the Rock Lighthouse and the

Crosby Light-vessel had not undergone much change ; its direction had been
altered by removing the light-vessel nearly 200 yards to tlie eastward ; the
average depth had remained nearly stationary at 30 feet. The average area
had slightly increased from 18,000 yards in 1840 to 18,840 yards in 1846.

    That portion between the light-vessels had undergone greater change.
Its length had been increased about 400 yards, the average depth reduced
to 26 feet; the average area increased about 1000 yards.

    Notwithstanding the change in the position of the Crosby Light-vessel
above-mentioned, and the removal of the Formby Light-vessel nearly 400
yards to the northward, the direction of the channel in 1846 was parallel to

its direction in 1840.

   The average of the whole channel from the Rock Lighthouse to Formby
Light-vessel is a depth diminished from 29 feet to 28^ feet, and an area in-

--creased nearly 700 yards.
    Victoria Channel. The direction of this channel had been altered by the
change in the position of the Formby Light-vessel above-mentioned, and by
removing the Bell Buoy about 500 yards westward. The average depth of
water on the bar had slightly increased, the various soundings having been
10 feet, 11 feet, and 12 feet.

  --Zebra Channel. The minimum depth on the fairway track through this

channel had been increased from 3 feet to 6 feet.

  --Formby Bank. The area of this bank had been slightly enlarged, and

the elevation very considerably increased, the volume having been nearly
13,000,000 yards 'in 1846, against rather more than 6,500,000 yards in 1840.
The position had been nearly stationary ; there had been a slight elongation
northwards and a slight movement eastwards.

  --Mad Wharf. This bank had sustained considerable loss of area by

abrasion on the north-western margin ; but this loss had been partially com-
pensated by increase of elevation, the change in which had been very great.
The volume in 1846 had been nearly 5,750,000 yards, against 6,500,000

yards in 1840.

  --Great Burbo. The area of this bank appears to have been unaltered,

taken as a whole, though there had been considerable local changes. The
elevation had been a good deal reduced, and, consequently, the volume ; the

difiFerence is represented by 59,750,000 yards in 1846, instead of 62,000,000
yards in 1840.

  --Western Channel. The eastern portion, or Rock Channel, had recovered

300 yards of its length in 1837 ; the average depth had been stationary, and
the average area slightly increased. The soundings at the bar had been un-
altered. In the Horse Channel East Hoyle Bank had advanced towards the
north-east, and the North-west Light-vessel had been moored about 300

--yards to the westward.
    East Hoyle. In area this bank had remained pretty stationary, but the
loss in elevation had reduced the volume from upwards of 73,500,000 yards
to under 72,000,000 yards.

 --Liverpool Dock Extension. These dock- works comprehended the Nelson,

Bramley-Moore, and Wellington Docks; the Wellington Half-tide Dock, the
Sandon Dock, the Sandon Graving Dock, and the Sandon Basin ; altogether

--a tidal area of about 117 acres.
   Meteorological Phcenomena. From observations recorded in the War-

rington Museum and Library, for the use of which the Committee is indebted

to Mr. Glazebrook Rylands of that town, it appears that the fall of rain in

ISi^ (the earliest year perfectly recorded) was 23'73 inches; in ISiS, 30"12

inches ; and in 1816, the year of the survey, 30-29 inches.

In ' Gore's Annals ' the following facts are noted :

buildings were unroofed. The damage done to the shipping in the river

--and outside the harbour was very great, and many lives were lost.
   ISi^. The dock receipts for the last week were much greater than were

ever received in any one week, and considerably more than double the

receipts of the corresponding week of last year. The long prevalence of

easterly winds in some measure contributed to produce so large an item.

  Northern Channel. \M9 The survey of 1849 does not exhibit any

marked changes beyond the consolidation of some of the outlying banks
near the junction of the Victoria and Zebra Channels; as, for example, that
of the Taylor's Bank and Jordan Flats. It appears to have been prepared
to show an alteration in the fairway track through the Victoria Channel, in
consequence of a shift westward of Little Burbo Bank. The positions of the
Bell Buoy and of the Formby and Crosby Light-vessels remained unaltered.

   The average depth of water on the Victoria Bar had been slightly re-

duced.

 --Dock Extension. The Huskisson Dock, the most northernly of the

Liverpool Docks, and the Birkenhead Docks, had made considerable progress

since the survey of 1 846.
   Meteorological Phcenomena.~T\\e Warrington tables record the rain-fall

--during the interval between the two surveys, as follows: In 1846, 30*29

inches; in 1847, 36*71 inches; in 1848, 33*75 inches; and in 1849, 33*98

inches.

   In Swineshaw Brook, a feeder of the Tame, which is a branch of the

Mersey, the rain-fall recorded by Messrs. Peter Clark, F.R.A.S., and J. F.

Bateman, F.G.S., Mem. Inst. C.E. (Memoirs of the Literary and Philoso-

phical Society of Manchester, page 17, vol. ix. second series), was as

--follows: 1845, 59'8 inches, "possibly registered too high; in other places

the fall just an average;" 1846, 42*6 inches, "and this year was consider-
ably below the average;" 1847, 49*35 inches, "this year was about the

average, in some places above."

  --Survey, 1852. The chart of 1852 shows that considerable and important

changes had taken place since the survey of 1846, with which that of 1849

may be considered in the main identical. The re-survey of the bay at the
latter period, as before observed, seems to have been confined to the imme-

diate vicinity of the Victoria Channel.

   The following comparison, therefore, is instituted between the surveys of

-- --1846 and 1852, a period of six years.
   Northern Channel Crosby Channel. The principal changes which had
taken place in that portion of the Crosby Channel between the Rock Light-

house and the Crosby Light-vessel, were its elongation, and the consequent
       THE RIVER MERSEY.                                               j33

removal of the Light-vessel about 2000 yards north-westwardly of its position

in 1846; the diminution of its average depth from 30 feet to 29 feet; and

the diminution of its average area from ISjS^O yards to 17,500 yards.

The direction of this portion of the channel had been slightly altered, as

indicated by the change in the position of the Light- vessel.

In that portion of this channel between the two Light-vessels, the changes

had consisted of the removal of the Formby Light-vessel about 750 yards

north-westwardly; an increase of the average depth from 26 feet, in 1846,

to 28 feet in 1852; and a diminution of the average area from 18,600 yards,

in 1845, to 16,450 yards in 1852.

In its whole length, the Crosby Channel during this period had been

elongated about 500 yards ; its average area diminished from 18,443 yards to
17,126 yards; and its average depth nearly stationary, but slightly increased.

The change in the position of the Crosby Light-vessel appears to have been

occasioned by the growth of a large elbow upon Great Burbo. The Formby

vessel appears to have been moved partly for the same reason, and partly

from a change in the position of Little Burbo, on the northern side of the

Victoria Channel.

  --Victoria Channel. The position of this channel had again undergone

very great change, the Bell Buoy having been removed about 1000 yards to

the southward, or nearly midway between its positions in 1840 and 1837.

The average depth of water on the bar had been very much the same in

1852 as in 1849, that is, rather less than in 1846.

 --Zebra Channel. The minimum depth of water in this channel had

increased from 6 feet, in 1846, to 7 feet in 1852; in other respects it had

--remained without material alteration.
   Formby Bank. This bank had been enlarged by the accession of the

Jordan Bank, and by its OM'n increased elevation : in 1846 the volume of
Formby Bank was nearly 13,000,000 yards; and that of Jordan Bank

1,500,000 yards, making a total of 14,500,000 yards ; in 1852 these quantities

were respectively 1 1 ,000,000 yards and 4,750,000 yards, or a total of 1 5,750,000

Mad --yards. Its position had been stationary.
            Wharf. This bank had sustained a slight loss of elevation ; but this
had been compensated in volume by an extension westward, the entire con-

tents having been nearly 6,500,000 yards in 1852, against nearly 5,750,000

yards in 1846, the former quantity being very nearly identical with that of the

same bank in 1840.

  --Taylor Bank. Taylor Bank and Jordan Flats, the former of which in

1833 had no existence, and the latter at that date of very minor importance,

had not only united in 1849, but in 1852 had largely increased in volume;

and in the same period had moved into close proximity with the united

Formby and Jordan Banks. During the period since 1833, Little Burbo, the
Middle, the West Middle, and other outlying banks had either been depressed

--below low-water level, or had disappeared altogether.
    Great Burbo. This bank had undergone material alterations since I846j

one of which was the extraordinary growth of the north-east angle in Crosby
Channel before-mentioned ; other important changes of outline may be

noticed on inspection of the cliarts perhaps the most remarkable alteration
                                                                                                                                                          ;

is the increase of bulk, arising partially from enlarged area, but principally

from increased elevation ; and it is to be observed that this additional eleva-
tion is generally diffused over the whole bank. In 1846 the volume of this
bank had been calculated to be about 59,750,000 yards; in 1852 it had in-

--creased to 69,500,000 yards.
   Western Channel. In 1852 the Rock Channel had again undergone a

slight elongation; the average depth had been reduced to 13 feet instead of
14- feet, as in IS-tG; but the average area had been nearly stationary. The
entrance from the Horse Channel had been slightly contracted. The sailing
direction for the Horse Channel had been altered a quarter of a point,
in consequence of a movement of East Hoyle Bank towards the north-

east.

  --East Hoyle. This bank had also acquired a considerable increase of bulk,

arising from additional elevation. Its volume in 1846 had been nearly
72,000,000 yards, in 1852 about 84,500,000 yards.

   Dock Extension Since 1846 the Huskisson Dock, Liverpool, had been
completed, and the north wall so far advanced as practically to exclude the
tidal water ; by these combined works about 355 acres have been abstracted
from the river.

    In the same period the works at Birkenhead had made great progress
and the stank or dam across the Great Float, and the walls of the north and

--south reserves constructed ; by these an additional area of 150 acres had been

taken from the tidal area of the river, making a total abstraction of
upwards of 500 acres.

  --Waste of Miver Margin. On the Cheshire side of the river, between

Seacombe Point and Sea Bank (Liscard), the waters of the river within
eight years have encroached upon the land to an extent, estimated by Mr.
Macpherson, the late surveyor to the Wallasey Board of Health, now of
Edinburgh, at 1 1,350,810 cubic feet ; which, at an average height of 40 feet,
represent 6^ acres.

   Meteorological Phcenomena From the Warrington tables, it appears that

--the rain-fall, between 1846 and 1852, was as follows:

1846=30-29 inches.  1850=27-79 inches.
                    1851=31-48 ,,
1847=36-71 ,,       1852=41-46 ,,
1848=33-75 ,,
1849=33-98 ,,

done. November 20.

    Survey, 1853. This survey appears to have been confined to the imme-
diate vicinity of the Victoria Channel, to show the alterations in the fairway
track, occasioned by changes intermediate between the surveys of 1852 and

1854.

  --Survey, 1854. Northerii Channel. The survey of 1854, like those of

1849 and 1853, appears to have been very partial, and has been confined
to the vicinities of the Victoria Channel and of the Rock Channel; the
leading line through the former had become more tortuous, though the posi-
tion of the Bell Buoy and the Formby Light-vessel had been unaltered. The
depths of water on the bar had slightly increased, the soundings being
11 feet, 12 feet, and 13 feet.

   The average area and average depth of the Crosby and Formby Channels
had not undergone any important change.

  --Zebra Channel. The direction of the Zebra Channel had been slightly

altered, having acquired a more westwardly bearing, and the average depth
of water considerably reduced ; the minimum sounding was 6 feet in 1854,

against 7 feet in 1852.

 --New Channel. A new swatchway, now known as the Queen's Channel,
                       ----

                       THE RIVER MERSEY.                              35

had been opened through the shoals, intermediate between the Zebra and
Victoria Channels, having a minimum depth of 9 feet.

  --The Banks. No material change had taken place in any of the banks,

except that Little Burbo had been sunk below low-water level, with sound-
ings of from 2 feet to 5 feet, and that the bulk of Taylor's Bank and Jordan
Flats had been slightly reduced.

  --Western Channel. The eastern portion of the Rock Channel had been a

good deal contracted, principally by enlargement of the foreshore at New

Brighton. The average area in 1854 had been reduced 200 yards, or about

--four per cent, per annum. The average depth had remained pretty stationary.
   Meteorological Phcunomena. From the Warrington tables, it appears that

the rain-fall at Warrington had been

                       In 1852=41-46 inches.
                           1853 =28-25 ,,
                           1854=27-18 ,,

  From the tables printed with Mr. Osier's paper " On the Self- registering

Anemometer and Rain-Gauge in the Liverpool Observatory," published in

the Reports of the Association for 1855, p. 128, it appears that the rain-fall

at Liverpool had been

                       In 1852=31-53 inches.
                           1853=22-42 ,,
                           1853=22-11 ,,

It will be observed that there is a very great difference between the

records for Liverpool and Warrington, the proportionate difference for each

year being very similar; and it is to be noted that it is the fall in the up-

country which is most likely to produce changes in the channels of the river,

through the agency of freshes.

The Liverpool tables for the first time furnish definite information upon

the phaenomena of wind. From them it appears that the point out of the

whole sixteen from which the wind blows for the greatest number of days

throughout the year is S.S.E., and therefore it has been said by Mr. Osier

that in Liverpool the prevailing winds are from that point. In the absence

of explanation, or without very careful explanation of the tables, this state-

ment is likely to convey an erroneous impression : if, instead of comparing

point with point, we take the five points from N. to W. both included, we
find that in 1854 the winds from this quadrant blew for as much as half

the year, or for as many days as the winds from all the other points taken

together. In the other years there is a preponderance of the same points,

though not to the same extent. The relative hourly velocity for the winds

from this quadrant is also greater than for those from other points.

   If reference be made to the table (p. 142, vol. 1855) which exhibits the ex-
treme pressure of the wind in pounds per square foot,and the greatest horizontal

motion of the air between any one hour and the next following hour, for all

the gales during the four years of which observations are recorded, in which

the pressure has reached \5 pounds per square foot, it will be observed that

in thirteen cases in which the velocity has exceeded fifty miles per hour, four

of them were from S. of W., attaining velocities respectively of 71, 70, 53,

and 51 miles per hour; the remainder being from W. to N.W., having
velocities varying from 51 to 5& miles per hour. It may also be observed

that of eighteen cases in which the pressure exceeded twenty pounds on the

square foot, four of them were from the S. of W., the pressure being respect-

W.ively 42 lbs., 42 lbs., 23 lbs., and 22 lbs. ; the remainder ranged from  to

N.W., and had pressures varying from 21 lbs. to 43 lbs.

  --1854. Violent hurricane visited Liverpool Feb. *7th and 8th. On refer-

ring to the last-mentioned table we find that the " severe storm," December

and the extreme pressure 42 lbs. per square foot ; and that it was repeated

on the 27th of the same month, blowing from S.W., the greatest velocity

Weseventv-one miles, and the extreme pressure 42 lbs.  also find that the

"violent hurricane," Feb. 17th and 18th, 1854, was, on the first day, from

N.W., the velocity fifty-six miles, the pressure 27 lbs, ; on the 18th, from
W.N.W., the velocity also fifty-six miles, the pressure 31 lbs. The same

table shows that during the years 1852 to 1854 there were several other

storms, of which ' Gore's Annals ' have no mention ; as, for example, Feb.

26th, 1853, from N.N.W., the velocity sixty miles, the pressure 33 lbs.;

and Jan. 26th, 1854, from W., the velocity fifty-three miles, the pressure

43 lbs.

In estimating the influence of the wind in producing changes in the sea

channels, it must be recollected that Liverpool Bay is peculiarly exposed to

winds ranging from W. to N., and sheltered from all other winds.

It is not intended in this Report to lay down any precise theory for the

solution of all the observed phsenomena of Liverpool Bay ; the collection of

the facts recorded in the [)receding portion of this Report, and in the charts

and tables by which it is accompanied, has been so recently completed as

entirely to preclude their satisfactory digest into any such hypothesis. In-

deed these researches, so far from furnishing a complete analysis of the data

upon which any trustworthy theory can be founded, give occasion to regret

that the various changes which the estuary has undergone were not more

fully recorded than they have been prior to 1833; and it is especially to be

regretted that the phaenomena of meteorology should have been so much

neglected in this district. The valuable records of the Liverpool Obser-
vatory, as well as those of the Warrington Museum and Library, it is to be

hoped, will supply the requisite information to future inquirers.

In recording the previous observations on the changes in the bay, the

earliest survey within the period of inquiry has been assumed as the starting-

point, and succeeding phaenomena are noted in chronological sequence; it is

now proposed to retrace the inquiry, in order, as far as practicable, to reduce

effects to their proximate causes, important facilities being derived from the

less imperfect data of the more recent periods.

On comparing the surveys of 1854 and 1852, it was observed that the

changes were almost entirely confined to the increased tortuousness of the

Victoria Channel, the continued silting up of the Zebra Channel, the opening

of the Queen's Channel, intermediate between the Zebra and the Victoria,
and the contraction of the eastern portion of the Rock Channel with a con-

sequent diminution of its average area. During this period there was no

abstraction of tidal water space for dock purposes, and consequently no re-

duction from that cause of the scour. In 1852 the rain-fall was about 50 per

cent, above the average. In 1853 and 1854 the fall was about an average
in each year. In the latter year, 1854, the wind was more than usually in

the range from W. to N.

   It may be observed that as the influence of freshes in a tidal river is
greatest when the ebb tide is low, their efi'ects in the Mersey will be more

apparent in the northern channel and its branches than in the western chan-

nel, because the direction of the latter is almost at right angles to the course

of the river, whilst that of the former is continuous ; the bar which crosses
THE RIVER MERSEY.  3?

the western channel at its junction witli the river will also tend to weaken
the scour of the water when the tide is low.

   It appears f.jien that the freshes of 1852, in passing down the northern
channel, were deflected by the banit called Taylor's Bank and Jordan Flats,
on to the N.E. elbow of Great Burbo, itself of recent formation ; after
passing that elbow the ebb took the direction due to the impetus down
Crosby Channel, moditied by the influence of Taylor-Jordan Bank combined
with Great Burbo, passed over the shoals between the Zebra and Victoria
Channels, and opened up the svvatchway now known as the Queen's Channel.
The channel thus initiated by the freshes of 1852 was deepened by the con-
tinued action of the ebb tide throughout that year and the following, until
in 1854 we find the Queen's Channel formed, the Zebra silting up from the
loss of the water which then passed by the new channel. On the Victoria
Bar, again, these freshes had won a slightly increased depth of water.

   The contraction of the Rock Channel may be due to the drift of sand
promoted by the N.W. wind.

   The most remarkable gales of the period 1852 and 1854 are those of De-
cember 25 and 27, 1852, from the W.S.W. and S.W., from denudation by
which the Cheshire land would protect the sand-banks; February 26, 1853,
from N.N.W. ; January 26, 1854, from W.; and February 17 and 18 of the
same year, fi-oni N.W. and W.N.W.

    Very important changes have been recorded as having taken place between
the years 1846 and 1852. They may be briefly described as consisting of
the enlargement and consolidation of all the banks, with the bare exception

of Mad Wharf, the increased size being in great measure due to increased

elevation; the elongation of the Crosby Channel, chiefly in that part between
the Rock Light and the Crosby Light-vessel ; and the diminution of the
average depth and area of this portion of the channel, accompanied by a

slight alteration in its direction ; in that part of this channel, between the
Crosby and Formby Light-vessels, the depth was considerably increased, but
the area diminished ; the changes in the channel were occasioned by the
growth of the north-east elbow of Great Burbo, and an accretion on the
western side of the Taylor-Jordan Bank, both of which had taken place
principally after the 1849 survey.

   On reference to the Warrington tables, we find that, in 1846, the rain-fall

was slightly, but very slightly, below the average of twelve years ; in the
three following years it was above the same average, particularly in 1847>
when the excess was about 16 per cent. ; in 1850 the fall was 10 per cent,
below the average, and in 1851 slightly above. It appears then, that during
the years 1848 and 1849, and particularly in 1850, the banks had grown in

 directions to produce, in 1851, those changes which rendered necessary the
survey of 1852. The increased depth of the channel between the lightships

above mentioned, seems due to the contracted width of that part, consequent
 upon the enlargement of the banks.

   We have no record of the phsenomena of wind during this period, and

therefore can only conjecture that the horizontal and vertical growth of the

banks are effects to which the prevailing winds may have been accessory,

 assisted by the loss of scour caused by the extensive dock-works of Liver-
 pool and liirkenhead.

    The change in the positions of the light-vessels and of the Bell Buoy was
 made after 1849. The depth of water on the Victoria Bar remained sta-

 tionary.

     In the Zebra Channel the depth of water had increased between 1846 and
  1849, when the rain-fall was rather above the average; and between 1849
  and 1852 the depth had diminished again.
--88 REPORT 1856.

   In the Rock Channel the average depth had been diminished, and the

average area stationary.

   As it was during this period that the greatest amount of tidal area taken
between two surveys was abstracted, the occasion is favourable for consider-
ing the influence of works of that kind upon the sea channels. According
to the evidence of Mr. Rendel, C.E., House of Commons, 1844- (see 'Ports
and Docks of Birkenhead,' by Thomas Webster, M.A., F.R.S., Barrister-at-
Law, 1848, p. 77), high water of an 18-foot tide is I'' 25" later at Warring-
ton Bridge than it is at the Prince's Pier, Liverpool, where it is 35" later
than at the Formby Light-vessel. And from Mr. Joseph Bouit's observa-
tions at W^oolston Weir, four miles above Warrington, that on 8th March
last, in a 21 -foot tide, high water was 1^ 50" later than was recorded by the

tide-gauge at George's Pier, Liverpool. It follows, therefore, that the water

which formerly covered the space now enclosed must have passed out to sea
on the top of the ebb tide, whilst the flood tide was yet rising in the upper

reaches of the river.

   The loss of depth in the Rock Channel appears to indicate that the abs-
traction of the tidal area has been prejudicial. The surveys since 1833
indicate a progressive, though irregular, tendency towards the silting up of
this channel; and there are facts which render it probable that the efl'ects of

diminished scour should first be manifiested here.

   The tidal establishment is earlier at the North-west Lightship, or entrance of
the western channel, than it is at the Bell Buoy, or entrance of the northern
channel ; though the difference is very slight, it is sufficient to give a bias to
the stream of tide, as is shown by the experience of bathers on the shore just
above the junction of the Rock Channel with the river, who find that with
a young flood there is a current out again to sea by the northern channel.

   The same also appears from the experiments of Mr. Enfield Fletcher, C.E.,
and others with floats. These were liberated at Wallasey Pool, on the ebb
tide, for the purpose of ascertaining in what time the water from the pool
-would reach the Victoria Bar; but all the floats, without exception, went
down the Rock Channel and grounded upon Dove Spit.

    This result may, in part, be due to the attraction of the Cheshire shore.
The bias with the ebb would, however, be confined to the upper stratum of
the water; the impetus of the current to sea naturally giving to the main
bulk the more direct course by the northern channel, in preference to the
almost right-angled deflection down the western channel.

   Whilst the Rock Channel has been losing depth, the depth of water in the
northern channel, considered in its whole length from the Rock Lighthouse
to the Bell Buoy, is almost undiminished since 1833. The loss on the Vic-
toria Bar may be due to the diversion to the part of the stream formerly by
the Zebra, now by the Queen's Channel. But for the elevation of the banks
and of the bottom of the Rock Channel, and of the south part of the Crosby
Channel, it is difficult to assign any other cause than the loss of scour at the
first of the ebb, and the influence of the prevailing winds in drifting sand

from the coast.

   As respects the Rock Channel, the influence of the new north wall in
Bootle Bay is very likely to agg^ravate the tendency to silt up, as it tends to

impede the advance of the flood tide through that channel by substituting

for a shelving shore a nearly perpendicular face almost at right angles to the

course of the flood.

   The influence which the direction of the enclosure walls may have upon

the course of tide has yet to be considered.
    It appears that between 1846 and 1849, during which these works were

in progress, there was no alteration in the direction of any of the channels;

and that between 1849 and 1852, these works being still in progress, the
direction of the Victoria Channel was so altered that the Bell Buoy waa

removed about 1000 yards westward of its position in 184-6 ; and that in the
upper or southern portion of the northern channel there had been no

changes in the fairway track beyond those consequent upon the elongation

of the part between the Rock Lighthouse and Crosby Light-vessel.

The change in the Victoria Channel is probably due to the lengthening of

the Crosby Channel, which has been attributed to the growth of the sand-

banks ; and it does not appear that the extension of the dock walls had yet
been productive of much eifect on the direction of the sea channels.

Between 1840 and 1846 the most remarkable of the recorded changes are,

a large increase in the size of the Formby Bank ; a slight diminution in those
of Great Burbo and East Hoyle, principally in elevation ; and a slight dimi-
nution in the depth of the Crosby Channel, principally in its northern part.

There was a remarkable drought in 1844, the rain-fall at Warrington

having been about 33 per cent, below the average of twelve years. There

was also an extraordinary continuance of easterly winds in this year. No

remarkable meteorological phaecoinena are recorded for the preceding year.

The large increase in the size of Formby Bank, and the loss of elevation in

East Hoyle and Great Burbo, are possibly to be ascribed to the influence of

the wind.

In 1840 to 1846 the Liverpool dock- works abstracted about 117 acres of

tidal area in northern works.

Between 1837 and 1840 the most remarkable change in the northern

channel is in the direction of the Victoria Channel, as indicated by the
removal of the Bell Buoy about 2000 yards northwards, accompanied by a

loss of 2 feet of water on the bar. According to a letter of Lieut. Lord's

of October 8th, 1839*, the dredging operations had deepened the water on

the Victoria Bar to 15 feet. On the survey of 1840, that depth was reduced

to 10 feet and 11 feet. In the period of 1837 to 1840 there had been a loss
of depth in the southern portion of the Crosby Channel, and a similar gain
in the northern part of the same ; a considerable reduction in the size of
Formby Bank, equal to 30 per cent. ; an increase in the Great Burbo ; a loss
of half the depth on the bar of the Rock Channel, and a loss of average
area in the same channel equal to 6 per cent, per annum ; and a diminution
in the area and elevation of East Hoyle.

There were no important dock-works during this period.

   There are no meteorological observations which throw light upon the

--cause of these changes beyond, 1st, the fact that there were great floods

in 1839 in various parts of Great Britain, by which much injury was occa-
sioned to the hay and other crops; and though the local ' Mercury' of the
date has no record of floods in the Mersey, there may have been freshets

and, 2nd, the vivid recollection of the terrific and destructive hurricane from
the S.W., which visited the town and port on the 6th and 7th of January,
1839, during which the North-west Lightship and many of the buoys in the
chaimel were washed from their moorings, and several vessels were wrecked.

--40 REPORT 1856,

    Between 1833 and 1837 was perfected that remarkable change in the

northern outlet of the Mersey, of which Capt. Denham has recorded so many

important particulars in his ' Sailing Directions,' and in communications to the
Association. But there is such a complete dearth of observations upon the
changes which preceded the opening of this new outlet in 1833, and upon
the meteorological phaenomeua by which they were preceded, or accom-
panied, that the result of any detailed inquiry must necessarily be extremely
precarious. The same observations apply to periods immediately subse-
quent and precedent to Capt. Thomas's survey in 1813. The general
features of the consolidation and enlargement of the principal sand-banks,

and also of the eastern shore of tiie estuary, may be observed upon this
survey, and also upon all the authentic surveys since that of Capt. Collins in

 1689. It is also remarkable that the low-water margin of the eastern shore
appears to have advanced westward to an extent fully equal to one-half the
width of the northern channel as laid down by Collins, or 1000 yards.

    From a report of Mr. George Ilennie, C.E., to the Corporation of Liver-
pool, in 1838, it appears that at that time upwards of 13,000 acres had been

 abstracted from the tidal area of the river, the original extent of which is
 estimated at about 35,000 acres, and these abstractions were principally in
 the upper part of the river. Since then no important abstractions have been

made without the sanction of Parliament.
    The tidal area appropriated to the dock purposes of Liverpool alone since

 1650 amounts to 784' acres, exclusive of the open basins ; of these, 4'70 acres
 have been appropriated within the last fifteen years.

    From the foregoing remarks it appears that the changes in Liverpool Bay

 are to be attributed principally to the influence of freshes, droughts, wind,
 and the reduction of tidal area ; and that remedial measures adopted for the
 maintenance or improvement of the approaches should be specially designed

 to cooperate with these forces.

    It may perhaps be thought that sufficient consideration has not been given
 to the very large amount of silt, which, according to Capt. Denham, in his

 paper in the 'Reports' of the Association (1837), is being constantly

 washed down by the river and deposited in the bay.
    The attention of the Committee has so far been confined principally to the

 phgenomena of the bay. Captain Denham supposed the silt to be derived

 from the shores of the upper part of the river, where there is no doubt that
 the tidal water continues to encroach upon the land. From the geological
 formation of this land, a large proportion of the silt must consist of clay and
 mud, with but a very small proportion of sand. The former, from its levity,
 is mostly conveyed away by the ebb tide, a thin deposit being only temporarily
 left upon the sandy shores and banks of the upper and lower estuaries, which
 is either dried up and dissipated by the wind, or removed by those neap tides
 which are too low to be able to continue the encroachments of the spring tides.

    Two local changes seem to require special notice before concluding this

 Report :
     1st. The waste of the clay cliff's in Cheshire, from Seacombe Point to

 North Egremont, which has now been going on to a considerable extent and
 for some years. This, there can be little doubt, is a consequence of the North
 Dock-works of Liverpool, by which the river has had its channel much con-
  tracted, and has naturally sought its equivalent from the opposite and weaker

   side.

     2nd. The waste on the Cheshire shore, adjacent to Leasowe Castle, west-
 wardly. According to Mr. RoUett, the acting-surveyor of the Wallasey Em-

  bankment, under the surveyor to the Corporation of Liverpool, this waste has
  averaged 6 yards per annum for nearly thirty years past. It is, however, con-
                                                          --

fined to a small lineal extent of the coast, about two miles. The situation is
one that is now very much exposed to the flood tide through the Horse Chan-
nel, especially in N.W. winds. The geological formation is entirely alluvial,

consisting of sand, peat, and clay. It is, in fact, the site of part of the so-

called suijuiarine forest of Wirral.

   When Hoyle Lake was in existence, the flood tide advancing in two

-- --streams one through the lake, the other through the Horse Channel met

at this place, and their united stream ran up the Rock Channel. It may be

assumed that the influence on the beach of the stream through the Horse

Channel was mitigated by the stream through Hoyle Lake, by which it

was deflected into the Rock Channel. As the lake was silted up the influ-

ence of the stream was gradually weakened, until it was entirely lost by the
closing up of the lake. The enlargement of the west spit of Great Burbo

has also assisted to give to the stream through the Horse Channel, a more

direct set upon the beach. About thirty years ago the late Mr. Giles, C.E.,

constructed an embankment upwards of 100 yards above high water spring

tides. The seaward slope is now submerged every tide; and as it was not

designed for such a situation, it has been occasionally broken through, almost

entirely reconstructed and considerably raised.

Great watchfulness is exercised by those who have charge of the embank-

ment; for if the sea were to make good its entrance through any breach,

a large tract of meadow country, nearly 3000 statute acres, would be sub-

merged in their whole extent to the docks at Birkenhead.

These meadows are part of the tidal area which had been reclaimed, and

was formerly submerged through Wallasey Pool.

    [With respect to the tables D, E, F, and G, by which this Report is ac-
companied, it should, perhaps, be observed that they are to be regarded as
only approximations to the truth, and not as representing the absolute areas
of the channels, or volumes of the banks; and they are merely intended as
gauges for comparing the growth or decline of the various features included
in them. The truth of the observation would be apparent to all who had
inspected the surveys ; it is recorded here for those who have not had the
opportunity of doing so.]

44 REPORT 1856.

Iteport -upon the effects produced upoji the Channels of the Mersey by the
   alterations which, during the last jifty years, have been made in its Banks,

   071 the Tides of the prese7it period compared with the Tides registered by

  Mr. Rendel in June 1844. By Andrew Henderson.

   It may be premised that the discussion on the subject, in June ISM, was
with reference to the proposed bill for establishing docks at Birkenhead ; it was
urged by Liverpool authorities that this would reduce the level of the river
by abstracting so large an area as 150 acres. The state of the river, then,
may be based on the tidal observations of Mr. Rendel at six stations, giving
diagrams of height of tide from Victoria Bar to Warrington Bridge, as

follows :

These observations were taken simultaneously ; and it may be seen that,

at the Prince's Pier, which is in the narrowest gorge of the e.stuary, the tide

heaps up 8 inches and 7 inches in the two miles from New Brighton. The

velocity of the flood tide at Seacombe is recorded as 721 1 feet per second,

the width of the Mersey being there reduced to 3060 feet, and the sectional

area 184,622 feet, it being altogether a gorge at that point defined by the

Prince's Dock wall on the one side, and the natural rock of Seacombe on

the other.
    This has been aptly designated the neck of the bottle, extending one mile

ft'om Egremont Ferry to Seacombe Ferry, where the Mersey is half a mile
broad to Prince's Pier, extending about one mile to the old fort before the
Stanley Dock was begun in 1844, at which time the mouth of the Mersey
bottle was between Egremont and the old fort, from whence a curved wall
half a mile east to Beacon's Gutter was built in 1833, the north shore to
Rimrose Brook (some three and a half miles) forming with the shore from

Seacombe to New Brighton what may be termed the funnel for filling the

bottle of the Mersey.

   These positions are exhibited on the map appended to the Report of Mr.
James Walker, C.E., to the conservators of the River Mersey, on the effects
of the new north river-line of the Liverpool docks on the Cheshire shore,

published June 1856, pp. 306, with abstract notes of evidence.
   As these documents contain much valuable information bearing on the

effects produced on the channels of the Mersey by the alteration made in
its banks, the following extracts are given, premising that the complaint was
the waste of the Cheshire shore about Egremont. The Report states, there
is no reason to doubt that an increase of damage has taken place and is con-

tinuing, and that the Liverpool dock walls are the principal cause.
   " One thing is certain, that the Liverpool dock trustees have acquired since

1844 an area of not less than 500 acres of land from the river; upon this
they have made splendid docks, and are now proceeding to add to them for

the benefit of the country, on a greater scale than they have hitherto done.
THE RIVER MERSEY.                              45

   " That the proper remedy for the prevention of further waste is a river

wall or other similar protection, from Seacombe to New Brighton ; and that

the dock trustees, in consideration of the damage done and of their having

already occupied 500 acres of the Mersey, and proposing to occupy in a few
years 150 acres more, which will increase the waste on the Cheshire shore,
may be reasonably expected to take the protection into their consideration.

    " That the effect which dock walls on the Liverpool side have had, or
are likely to have, in deepening the navigation of the Mersey or its entrance
channels, does not amount to much more than a tendency."

   The evidence of Capt. Cook, Superintendent of Pilots, states, " There are
now four channels, viz. the Rock or Horse, Victoria, Queen's, Zebra or
Eastern Channels. Large vessels enter by the Victoria Channel. The
Queen's improves, but not yet log-lined. Not very important to have very
deep entrances into Liverpool, as the heavy ships enter the docks.

West wind raises the tide 5 or 6 feet, east wind cuts the tide as much. As
regards the effects of the dock walls already built upon the navigation of
the river, Mr. J. Hartley, Lieut. Lord, and the dock-masters assert that
there has been no perceptible difference in the height of the tides for many
years, the old tables of depth upon the sills of the docks being still found to
be the correct guide, and the velocity, so far as they can observe, being un-

altered."

   Some witnesses considered that the tides rose vertically 2 feet higher at Sea-
combe, but no gauge having been kept, the impression may have arisen from
the greater effect, or in " consequence of the lash of the waves upon the
Cheshire side being heavier," since the last built portion of the " dock wall
is placed so as to meet the waves that are brought by the westerly gales
through the Rock Channel."

   This is shown on the Plan attached to the Report ; and the Report states,
" It is also to be expected that the rebound will be increased when the gap
which at present leaves a portion of Bootle Bay open to receive the seas, shall
be filled up by a wall, as I presume is intended."

  A reference to the Plan will show that the filling up of this gap would

not only greatly increase the evils complained of at Seacombe, but cause the
Rock Channel to silt up in a few years, as Hoylake has done ; and should
the wall be extended to Rimrose Brook, as proposed in 1858, enclosing
150 acres, it will greatly reduce the flow of water into the Mersey by con-
tracting the entrance between the fort on the Rock Point and high water

at Bootle Bay, distant 1-i- mile or 2700 yards. The map shows the present
end of wall to extend 900 yards across the entrance to a river wall of 250
yards towards a gap of 700 yards, thus reducing the entrance between the
river wall and the Fort on Rock Point to 1800 yards, with a bulb between
Seacombe and New Brighton, where the sea and tide through the Rock
Channel deflected from the Liverpool wall are wasting the shore. The only
remedy for this being, as stated in the Report, " the construction of a wall
4000 yards long from Seacombe to New Brighton."
-- ----

46 REPORT--1856.

   From opposite Seacombe the Liverpool dock wall extends 4000 yards to

the gap in Bootle Bay: by ending it there, only a curved line, similar to that
in 1833, shown in the Plan, with a sloping sea-wall, would allow the sea to
expend itself in Bootle Bay as heretofore, and act as the eastern side of the
funnel of the Mersey, the Rock Channel forming the western.

   The effects these alterations may have had on the levels of the tides in
the Mersey, since they were recorded by Mr. Rendel in ISi^, we have no

means of comparing, as it will be seen by the before-mentioned table ; they
only relate to two tides of that year, which are so much affected by the

wind as to form no criterion, it requiring the average of a long period to

establish any change in the mean height and flow of the tide.

  We are indebted to Lieut, Lord for the only reliable results derived from

the observations of the self-registering tide-gauge at George's Pier, Liver-

pool. The discussion of two years of these tidal observations, 1854--55, by

Mr. Burdwood, of the Hydrographer's Office, Admiralty, gives the following

mean :

Lieut. Lord's diagrams furnish the levels of high and low water, direction

and force of the wind, and height of the barometer every day in the year, as

well as an intermediate line indicating the ordinary sea-level as averaging

6 feet above the old dock sill.

As these observations are to be continued at several stations on the Mersey,

we may look upon them as the basis of future observations on the changes

in the level and flow of the tides in that river.

Mr. Rendel's diagrams are very useful, as recording the tidal wave in 1844

as well as the relative time of high water at the Bar, New Brighton, Prince's

Dock, Runcorn, Fidler's Ferry, and Warrington Bridge.

From information obligingly furnished to the Committee by Mr. Fereday

Smith, Mr. R. Skay, and Mr. Edward Johnes and other sources, we may

confidently contemplate the establishment of a record of the tides of the

Mersey, both at Ellesmere and other points, with reliable data and informa-

tion on the important subject.                     Andrew Henderson.

Interim Report to the British Association^ on Progress in Researches

   on the Measurement of Water by Weir Boards. By James
   Thomson, C.E.

                                                                                                      Belfast, August 6, 1856.

Having at last year's meeting of the Association read in the Mechanical
Section a short paper on the Measurement of Water by Weir Boards, and

having been requested by the General Committee to prepare a Report on
the same subject, I beg now to state that 1 have in the meantime been col-

MylectiDg information for the purposes of that Report.  professional en-

gagements have occupied me necessarily so much as to oblige me to defer

for this year the detailed prosecution of the subject and the preparation of

the Report in full. I have, however, the gratification of stating, that, with

special reference to the researches entrusted to me by the Association, the
President of the Athenaeum of Boston, United States, Mr. Thomas G. Gary,

has generously sent to me, with the request that it be presented to the

British Association on his behalf, a valuable book, containing accounts of

experiments recently carried out on a very grand scale in America on the

measurement of large bodies of flowing water by means of Weir boards and

by other methods.

The work is entitled ' Lowell Hydraulic Experiments,' by James B.Francis.

In reference to the experiments, Mr. Gary, the donor of the book, states in

his letter to me, " These experiments, made under the direction and at the
expense of the associated companies of Lowell, near Boston, who employ

Mr. Francis as the engineer for their cotton and woollen factories, have cost

about Б4000 sterling ; and they make part in a series of investigations which

have cost those companies Б15,000."

In the Report which I hope to submit to the British Association, I shall

have much occasion for reference to these important experiments, and for
this purpose I think it right to retain the book in my hands at present.

As the expenses incurred in reference to the researches have been but

small, and chiefly for the procuring of books, I do not desire to draw for

them on the fund of Б1 liberally placed at my disposal by the Association

and as my intention is, not to conduct experiments on the subject myself,

but chiefly to give a review of the most important experiments and deduc-

tions which have been made by others, I do not think it necessary to ask

for a renewal of the grant.

           --Dredging Report. Frith of Clyde. 1856.

At the last meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of

Science, held in Glasgow, the following resolution was adopted:

        " That a Gommittee, consisting of the Rev. G. P. Miles, M.D., Professor
           Balfour, Dr. Greville, and Mr. Eyton, be requested to report on the
          dredging of the West coast of Scotland, and that the sum of Б10 be
             placed at their disposal for the purpose."

   Of the Gommittee only two members have been able to devote any

time to the object contemplated, viz. Dr. Greville, and the Rev. G. P. Miles.
The latter, having engaged a residence on Holy Island, Lamlash Bay, was
joined by the former on June 9th, when both were prepared to commence a
systematic course of dredging, and to give up their whole time, for several
weeks, to the work. They had provided themselves with the Government
charts, and with such books on the different departments of marine zoology
as were likely to be of service ; they had also everything requisite for the

preservation of specimens ; and they had at their command a small yacht*,

and a stout four-oared cutter f. So far, therefore, as material was concerned,
the Gommittee had armed themselves for a vigorous campaign.

    In the arrangement for their plan of proceeding, the Committee took into

--^8 REPORT 1856.

consideration the terms of tlieir instructions; and they came to the conclusion
that it would be impossible to draw up a satisfactory Report in the course
of a single season. They do not regard a mere enumeration of the forms of
animal life, as observed from time to time by different individuals, as the
object contemplated by the Association, but rather some account of the
distribution of those forms in the estuary and Lochs of the Clyde, coupled
with some efforts to render our knowledge of the Fauna more complete. It
appeared to them that the most proper course would be for the Committee,
not to aim too suddenly at issuing a general Report, but rather to present,
for some time to come, an annual statement of their labours. By a judicious
change of head-quarters, they would be enabled, in successive seasons, to
pursue their investigations in a way best calculated to promote the ultimate
views of the Association.

   The naturalist's dredge has been used in the Clyde for some years by
various persons, but, as far as is ascertained, without any special plan ; and
although in many instances notes have been preserved, the existing materials
for a full Report are utterly insufficient. Of the different localities, Lamlash
Bay has, perhaps, acquired the greatest reputation. It occurred therefore
to the Committee that it would be peculiarly desirable to ascertain, with
some precision, the extent and distribution of the forms existing in this sec-

--tion of the Clyde stating whether they are rare or frequent in these parts.

They hoped to accomplish this end with comparatively little trouble, as they
had repeatedly dredged over portions of the same ground on former occa-
sions ; and, further, they had the experience of Major Martin and of the late
Rev. Dr. Landsborough to assist them. Other places in the vicinity of
Lamlash Bay were marked out for examination, with special reference to
Kilbrennan Sound, on the west side of Arran, which, it is believed, has been
unexplored by the scientific dredger.

   To their exceeding regret the Committee have to state that they had
scarcely made their arrangements before the weather became adverse. Rain

-- --and wind the latter often rising to a gale set in, and continued, with a

few exceptional days, throughout the months or June and July, that is, from
the moment they were prepared to commence oppratiocs until the last day
at their disposal previous to the Meeting of the Association. The precarious
position of the dredger could not be more forcibly illustrated. During the
first month scarcely more than one day in each week would admit of the
dredge being used, and, altogether, there were oxi\^ fifteen days available for
the prosecution of the work, which was sometimes attempted when the seve-
rity of the weather made it all but impracticable to sail the yacht, and when
the employment of the four-oared cutter would have been impossible. The
intended visit to the west of Arrau has consequently been postponed ; and,
under these disastrous circumstances, the unfortunate Committee found
occupation, in spite of rain and wind, in searching the pools and coast at low
tide, and in collecting the littoral nudibranchs, echinoderms, crustaceans, &c.

   The ground explored by the dredge embraces, as marked in the accom-

--panying map* (Plate II.), the following well-defined localities: The south

side of Brodick Bay, from Invercloy to Corriegills, in depths varying from 7
to 25 fathoms ; the entire area of Lamlash Bay, from Clachland Point to the
north end of Holy Island, and from the south end of Holy Island to Kings-
cross Point ; the eastern, or outer side of Holy Island, from Hamilton's Rock,
near Clachland Point, to the most southern point of the island, in from 30 to
6 fathoms ; and from Fullarton's Rock to Whiting Bay.

   The subjoined Tables give the results of the labours of the Committee:

--52 REPORT 1856.

Among the Nudibranchiata, a species of rare beauty was obtained when

dredging in Brodiciv Bay, between Invercloy and Corriegills, in from 10 to

15 fathoms. As it could not be identified by the Committee, a sketch taken

--by Dr. Greville was forwarded to Mr. Alder, who replied, "The beautiful

Nudibranch you have found is a Lomanotus, and probably new; but of this

we could not be certain without a careful examination, and I shall therefore

be glad to avail myself of your kind offer to send the animal alive. I dredged

a minute Lomanotus (only quarter of an inch long) in Lamlash Bay in 1846,

whicli is figured in the 6th Part of our Monograph, under the name of

L.Jiavidus. I think it can scarcely be the young of this large species*.

Since the completion of our work, we have received from Mr. Thompson of

Weymouth, a somewhat similar Lomanotus, white, Avith orange processes,

and about an inch long. Yours differs from them in the length of the vela-

filaments and the expansion at the posterior extremity, and also from the

latter in the large size of the tentacular sheaths. The only British specimens

of this new genus we have yet seen have been in a sickly state, and only one

of each kind, so that any additional information concerning them is desirable.

Perhaps if you should be dredging again in Lamlash Bay alter the receipt

of this you will be so good as to keep a look out for the small L.Jiavidus.

It was dredged in shallow water among scallops, very near to the Holy

Island. The only specimen of Doris planata yet found I also got there."
   The Committee have to add, with deep regret, that this apparently new

form of Lomanotus, having been placedybr safety in the vivarium, has disap-

peared, and, although the tank was emptied for a thorough search, no trace

whatever could be found. Two unsuccessful attempts have since been made

--to .secure another specimen by dredging in Brodick Bay.
   To conclude : The result, in a general point of view, of the Committee's

present and previous researches, added to those of other parties, as far as they

are known, is, that although Lamlash Bay contains many interesting forms,most

of the rarer ones are so exceedingly scarce as to cause considerable disappoint-

ment to the collector. The naturalist who wishes to secure a series of cabinet

specimens, especially of shells, and to obtain a store of duplicates in return

for his expenditure of time and money, must seek other localities. For

example, with regard to the more interesting Mollusca inhabiting the Lami-

narian zone and deeper water, Lima liians, with its curious nests, can alone

be pronounced abundant. It may be obtained in any quantity. Pecten

tigrinus comes next in order, but an entire day's dredging, in the most

favourable ground, would scarcely produce more than half-a-dozen good

full-sized specimens. In the course of several days' dredging this season,

single specimens only of Lyonsia Norvegica and Pilidium fulvum were

secured; of the Eulinife, only two of Eiiliina polita and a solitary specimen

of E. distorta; of Chemtiitzia none; of Trichotrojiis borealis one.; of Odos-

tomice none; of Rissoce only the common species; of Muugelice, one of

M. Leiifroyi, three of the rare 31. teres, a few of the common M. linearis,

and one of M. riifa, var. Ulideana ; of Cylichna; none, except two or three

poor specimens of C. cylindracea                                                                                                                        of Philine none, except P. aperta.  It is
                                                                                                                                                     ;

remarkable that species, which usually are not accounted at all scarce, are

represented sparingly in this part of the Clyde district. Mr. Barlee, well
known as one of the most practical couchologists and indefatigable dredgers

in Great Britain, visited the Committee, and, having dredged over the best

ground! for two days, came to tiie conclusion that Lamlash Bay is remark-

ably deficient both in MoUuscan forms generally and in the number of indi-

   * The species dredged by the Committee was 2 inches in length.

   t That is, from Hamilton's Rock, near Clachland Point, to the North and N.E. end of
Holy Island, in from 35 to 15 fathoms. Also in the vicinity of Fullarton's Rock.

vlduals which actually exist there. Among the Echinodermata, the only-

species of any interest that is really abundant, in certain defined localities,

is Comatula rosacea. Nor is Goniaster Teinpletoni unfrequent, that is, iialf-
a-dozen examples may be procured in a successful day's dredging. The

same may be said of tJraster glacialis. More rarely brought up is Liiidia
fragillissima, especially of full size. Professor Allman and his party did

not succeed in finding more than one adult individual during two days'
dredging with the Committee. At the same time specimens measuring from
4 to 6 inches across are often seen at low water both at Lamlasli and in
Holy Island. Only one specimen of Pahnipes membranaceus (immature) has

been taken this season. And of the Holothuriadse not one has occurred

except Chirodota digitata, of which two examples came up in the dredge,
in from 15 to 6 fathoms, near the house on Holy Island. With respect
to the Crustaceans, the rarer forms of Podophthalma are poorly repre-
sented^. Nor is there much to report of Zoophytes, for both Anthozoa and
Polyzoa are remarkably deficient with the exception of a few of the com-

monest kinds, and even some of those most generally distributed appear to

be wanting altogether.

   In closhig this necessarily meagre Report, the Committee take the oppor-

tunity to make some observations on the expenditure connected with dredg-
ing operations. Boats must of course be hired, with crews, according to
circumstances. In some localities, a stout boat, with a couple of men, may
get through some work in fine weather, and with a depth of water not ex-
ceeding lb or 12 fathoms. But if the dredge be constantly down the labour
is severe, and the occasional assistance of the gentlemen, whose time ought
to be otherwise employed, will be required. Four men are not too many,
and, in some states of the weather, they are necessary. The charge for a
boat and two men cannot be set down at less than from 5s. to 6s. a day.
At Laralash the usual charge is 7.". Qd. For deep-sea dredging, and indeed

for the examination generally of the more exposed parts of the Clyde,

--whether in shore or at a distance, a small sailing craft is indispensable such
--as a common herring boat with a crew of four men, the cost of which
--would be about Б4 a week. This, Mr. Barlee the Committee could not
--quote higher authority has found to be quite efficient. With such a vessel

having a boat in tow, dredging may be carried on when oars would be use-
less. From the above statement of the absolute outlay inseparable from

dredging operations when conducted on a useful scale (omitting altogether

the cost of material, its wear and tear, and various contingent expenses), it
will be evident that a grant of Б10 will go but a short way in the hands of

an active Committee.

Since my last report to the British Association I have received but a very

will be found one or two of remarkable interest as presenting very peculiar

features.

   I am chiefly indebted, as hitherto, to Mr. E. J. Lowe.

" Sir, This evening, at a quarter before five o'clock, being at St. Thomas's

Hill, near Canterbury, I was struck by what appeared a rocket in brilliancy,

but with sparks more compacted than usual. I ran to a position where no

trees intercepted my sight, and was astonished to find a bright vertical line

--[to appearance about 6 ft. long and 2 in. wide] * in the south, immediately

under Saturn.

" There was no cloud near it, or indeed, on the whole hemisphere at the

time. Its brilliancy exceeded that of the planet, and it seemed to emit light

in the manner of a gilded snake.
   " It continued about five minutes with this aspect, when its form began to

change, and showed a bold curve in its centre, with a deflection at each ex-

tremity ; at this time, a bright, waving, thread-like tail became visible, and
very soon after a similar vermiform appearance in the opposite direction was
to be seen at the top. As the body, so to speak, curved, so 1t appeared to
become broader, and in about 10 minutes the general direction was changed,

for it had lost its vertical direction, and was just acquiring a horizontal one.
   " It was not till this time that its nature could be defined ; but now it

showed that it was a thin cloud, and it finally passed away without leaving

a trace behind.                                                                  " I am, Sir, yours truly,

   Ф The sky being very clear, it was still bright day-light. Supposing it only
a rocket, although a gigantic one, we resumed our conversation, but the sta-
tionary character of the train again attracted our attention, though we ascribed

it chiefly to the stillness of the air, or not quite so oblique. After
upwards of five minutes it gradually became less dense, as if the

fiery flakes or atoms receded from each other. Then it gradually
assumed the appearance of a series of very bright small clouds

these bodies are not self-luminous. The light seems to be owing to the me-

teor, instead of the light of the meteor ; probably the great speed causes a pe-
culiar property of the upper regions to ignite, at the instant of ignition being

an intense blaze, and then subsiding into a phosphorescent flame, which may

linger for a length of time and be wafted along by currents of air, as was the

case in several instances. In the case of the meteor of Dec. 19, 1855, it moved

over 1 8^░ in less than a second of time ; it cannot therefore be supposed that

the meteor itself could be within 5░ of this path 10 minutes afterwards. Now

if we suppose the meteor burst at this point (which to me seems improbable),

it must have burst in a medium where light could shine, and if so it is as easy

to suppose some substance should be ignited, as the meteor itseli' should blaze.

The intense brightness is too great fur reflected light.     ,,p j j ,,╗

Photochemical Researches. By Professor Bunsen, of Heidelberg,
               and Dr. Henry E. Roscoe, of London.

We had the honour of laying before the Chemical Section of the British

Association at the Glasgow Meeting, a short account of a series of experi-

ments which we had undertaken with the view of becoming more nearly

acquainted with the laws which regulate the chemical action of light, and of

obtaining, if possible, a measure for this action.

These experiments, the continuation of which has been assisted by a

grant from the Association, have been extended during the present summer

months, and we beg to lay before the meeting, in a short report, the chief

results as yet obtained.

The method employed by us for measuring the chemical action of light is

founded upon the well-known fact that chlorine and hydrogen combine when

exposed to light. The employment of this reaction as a measure of the

chemical action of light was proposed and practically carried out by Dr.

Draper of New York in 184'4', to whom belongs the great credit of first

Ahaving attempted to obtain a measure for this action.       number of experi-

ments instituted for the purpose of testing the accuracy of the instrument

proposed by Draper, assured us, however, that not only for observations

extending over a considerable period of time, but even for those of short

duration the indications of the instrument were not reliable. The possibility

of obtaining exact photometrical results with a mixture of chlorine and hy-

drogen, depends upon the fulfilment of various conditions which in Draper's

tithonometer have not been regarded. Of these conditions the two most

essential are

   1. The constant composition and purity of the gaseous mixture.
   2. Constant pressure exerted upon the gas.
   It is easy to show from the laws of gas absorption that the method em-
PHOTOCHEMICAL RESEARCHES.  63

ployed by Draper for evolving the sensitive gas never could have furnished
it of constant composition.

    Draper's instrument consists of a siphon tube, of which one limb is short
and closed, and the other longer, narrow and open at top. The long limb is
furnished with a scale, the shorter one has two platinum wires melted into
the glass near the bend. The whole of the short, and part of the long limb,
is filled with hydrochloric acid saturated with chlorine, and by means of an
electric current the acid can be decomposed and the gases collected in the
short limb. According to Draper no gaseous chlorine is evolved during the
electrolysis of hydrochloric acid ; the hydrogen, however, set free at the
negative pole passing through the liquid displaces some of the chlorine held
in solution, and thus a sensitive gas is obtained and collected in the shorter
siphon limb. The composition of this gas cannot, however, be constant, for
according to the law of gas absorption, when a mixture of gases is collected
over water, the free gas cannot possess a fixed composition before a certain
relation between the volumes of the dissolved gases has been attained. Until
this equilibrium has ensued, a continuous interchange between the volumes
of free and dissolved gases must take place, and in the case of the tithono-
meter this equilibrium is not even approached. Another more considerable
source of error in Draper's instrument lies in the difference of pressure to
which the gas is subjected during the experiments, arising from the gradual
fall of the liquid in the longer limb in proportion as the sensitive gas is
acted upon by the light.

    Having assured ourselves that the indications of the tithonometer cannot be
relied on, the necessity of obtaining an instrument in which the foregoing
and many other essential conditions are fulfilled, became apparent. The
first object therefore was to obtain a gas consisting of equal volumes of
chlorine and hydrogen of constant composition. This object we attained
(contrary to Draper's express statement) by the electrolysis of aqueous
hydrochloric acid. Exact volumetric analysis convinced us that as soon as
the acid is saturated with the two gases, in accordance with the laws of ab-
sorption, the evolved gas consists exactly of equal volumes of chlorine and
hydrogen, unaccompanied by oxides of chlorine, or hydrogen or other im-
purities. After many fruitless attempts, we have at length constructed an
apparatus in which the second, and all other required conditions are satisfied,
and by means of which we have been enabled not only to obtain a relative,
but even an absolute measure for the chemical action of light.

    This apparatus, represented in PI. III., is constructed entirely of glass,

and consists essentially of four parts : firstly, a tube (a) containing carbon
or platinum poles i'astened on platinum wires melted through the glass,
serving for the electrolytic decomposition of the aqueous hydrochloric acid

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

secondly, a set of bulbs for washing the gas, furnished with a glass stopcock
for shutting off the supply of gas; thirdly, a small flattened glass bulb (c)
containing water, in wliich the gas is exposed to the action of the light; and
fourthly, a capillary tube (d) furnished with a millimetre scale, on which the
diminution of volume caused by the absorption of the hydrochloric acid is
accurately observed by the advancing column of water. Each of these
pieces is fitted air-tight into its place by ground-glass joints, so that no
caoutchouc or other organic substance comes in contact with the sensitive gas.

    In this arrangement the pressure is rendered constant throughout the
whole apparatus by raising or depressing the exit tube dipping into the
bottle (e) filled with water, and by means of the horizontal absorption tube
(d) the pressures before and after the experiment do not differ by two milli-
metres of water.
                                                                     --

--64 REPORT 1856.

A series of experiments conducted with lamp-light for the purpose of

testing the accuracy of the instrument, gave the following results:

As soon as the atmospheric air has been completely expelled from the ap-

paratus by the electrolytic gas, and the equilibrium between the amounts of

gas absorbed by the water, and the fiee gas established, an action is observed

on exposing the gas to the light. This action, however, does not commence

immediately on exposure to the light ; a short time elapses before the absorp-

tion of the water in the tube (d) begins, but this soon takes place, showing

that the combination eiFected by the light in the vessel (c) has commenced.

This absorption becomes gradually quicker until a certain rapidity is at-

tained, after which the action continues regular as long as the source of

light remains constant. This peculiar phsenomenon, to which we have given

the name of Photochemical Liduction, is one of great interest and import-

ance, and as the study of this branch of the subject has occupied our pai'-

ticular attention, the results obtained will be subsequently detailed.

On passing more gas through the apparatus and again isolating the

mixture, the same phaenomenon is observed, with the difference, that the

constant action is larger than in the former case, that is, the gaseous mixture

has become more sensitive. In this way, by continuing to lead the gas

evolved from successive portions of hydrochloric acid through the apparatus,

the action brought about by a gas flame of the same dimensions increases

regularl)', until, after having continued the operation for several (from 12 to

18) hours, the amount of action effected by the flame remains constant.
The apparatus has then attained its maximum degree of sensibility, and, as

we shall show, always gives comparable results. Before this maximum

action is attained, upwards of 5000 cub. cent, of gas must be passed through

the apparatus, which contains only about 2 cub. cent, of water requiring

saturation. Observations made with the apparatus thus prepared, showed

that the light from a gas lamp concentrated by a lens produced always

exactly the same amount of action on various days and with fresh gaseous

mixtures evolved from different portions of acid. These experiments sufficed

to show that our apparatus was capable of producing reliable and accurate

Weresults.  next determined the limits of concentration between which the

hydrochloric acid can be used, and experiment showed that the amount of an-

hydrous acid contained in solution must not diminish to 20 per cent., as the gas

evolved from an acid of that concentration nolonger gives the maximum action.

Having assured ourselves that the apparatus gave, under these circum-

stances, comparable results, it became necessary to examine whether the

heat evolved from the combination of the gases, and more especially the

heat radiated from the source of light, had any appreciable efl^ect upon the

indications. By comparing the relative volumes of the vessel, in which the

insolation takes place, and the absorption tube, it was found that a rise of

less than 0░"04; Cent, in the mass of the gas would cause an expansion of

1 millimetre on the absorption tube. Hence the apparatus is not only a

photometer, but also a very delicate air-thermometer. In order to prevent

any of the rays of radiant heat from expanding the gas, the insolation-vessel

was placed behind a double metallic screen furnished with a metallic cap

fitting over the vessel. The rays of light fell on the gas through an opening

in the screen filled by a layer of water contained between two plate-glass

surfaces. By filling the apparatus with atmospheric air, it was proved that

with this arrangement the source of light may be placed within a few inches

of the gaseous mixture, without the radiant heat interfering in the least with

the indications. The sources of exterior error arising from radiant heat

having been thus removed, it only remained to determine whether the heat
       PHOTOCHEMICAL RESEARCHES.                    ^

evolved from the slow combustion of the chlorine and hydrogen exerted any
perceptible action upon the instrument.

   On suddenly cutting ofF the light from the sensitive gas, the action is

found not to cease immediately. This absorption, after the exclusion of the

light, may be owing to three causes.
   1. The combination of the gases may continue for a short time after the

removal of the light.

   2. The hydrochloric acid formed may not be instantaneously removed by

solution in the water.

   3. The decrease of volume may be produced from the whole gas cooling
down, owing to the heat of combustion no longer being added to it.

    Experiments undertaken to determine which of these three suppositions
was true, showed that this contraction could be almost completely accounted
for, from the decrease of temperature of the gas, proving therefore that the
first two assumptions were groundless. This contraction is so small that it
does not in the least degree interfere with the accuracy of the observation.

   In order still more fully to test our apparatus, an arrangement was made
by means of which a small jet of coal-gas could be brought within different
measured distances of the sensitive mixture, and the amount of the decom-
position effected measured. The results thus obtained showed most exactly
that the chemical action varied inversely as the square of the distance from
the source of light, proving that the chemical rays obey the same general
law as the visible rays, and affording another evidence of the accuracy of
the results obtained by this instrument. Observations made with this ar-
rangement also showed that exactly the same action was effected by the
flame, placed at the same distance, at different times extending over a period
of one month. The amounts of action effected by the same flame on various
days from the 12th to the 26th of June, were 13-99, 13-8.S, 13-76, 13-84.

       Photochemical Induction.

Chemical affinity, or the force which causes different bodies to unite and

form chemical compounds, is in every particular case a certain definitive,

unalterable quantity, which like all other forces (and matter itself) can

neither be created nor destroyed. Hence it is incorrect to say that, under

certain circumstances, a body attains an affinity which under other circum-

stances it loses. All that can be said in such a case is, that the body at one
time follows the chemical attraction, and at another time is retarded by
forces acting in an opposite direction. This opposite action may be con-

ceived to be a resistance similar to that occurring in friction, or in the
passage of electricity through conductors. This resistance is overcome

when we facilitate the formation of a precipitate by agitation, or when che-

mical action is brought about by increase of temperature, catalytic action,
or insolation. The existence of such a resistance presupposes a certain com-

bining power, which may be measured by the amount of combination caused

by the unit of force in the unit space of time.

   The act by which this resistance is overcome, and the state reached in
which combination take* place, we have called Chemical Induction. The

laws Avhich regulate the action of chemical affinity, when this resistance is

fully eliminated, are as yet entirely unknown to us ; and although the solution

of tliis, the most important problem in our science, appears at present so far

removed, it is at least desirable that facts should be found which may form
starting-points in this new field of research. The interesting relations in

which the phsenomena of photochemical induction stand to these questions,

have induced us to examine this part of the subject with particular attention.

1856.                                            F
--66 REPORT 1856.

The circumstance that the combination of chlorine and hydrogen does

not take place immediately on exposure to the light, was observed by Draper

in 184'4. This was explained by him on the supposition that the chlorine,

by exposure to the light, was transformed into a permanent allotropic modi-

fication which differed from ordinary chlorine by possessing greater com-

Webining power.  have convinced ourselves that this explanation of the

phsenomenon is incorrect, and have proved that it is connected with actions

of a very peculiar nature which may be classed together under the terra of

Chemical Induction.

  A number of experiments made with both diffuse solar and lamp-light,

with different mixtures and various masses of sensitive gas for the purpose

of determining the inductive action, showed that the times which elapse until

the action begins, and until the maximum action is attained, are very different.

We therefore next proceeded to examine the various causes which might

influence the amount of the induction. First, the relation between the

inductive action and the mass of the gas; secondly, the eflFect produced on

the inductive action by variation of the amount of light, with a constant

volume of gas; thirdly, the effect produced on the inductive action by

allowing the gas to remain in the dark ; and fourthly, the action of small

quantities of foreign gases upon the induction.

Experiments carried on with the view of answering the first of these

questions, showed that the inductive action, or the transition of the gas from

the inactive to the active state, was retarded by increase of the mass of gas.

A larger volume of gas had to be insolated for a longer time than a smaller

volume before the maximum action ensued.

The influence of the amount of light on the rate of the inductive action

was proved to be very great. The time required for induction diminished

with increase of the amount of light, and in a quicker proportion than the

increase of light.

   On allowing a sensitive mixture, which had already been insolated, and

had attained its maximum action, to stand for some time in the dark, it was

found that upon readmission of light the action did not begin again immedi-

ately, but a new induction was necessary before the maximum action was

attained. Hence the change effected upon the gas by the light is not a per-

manent one, for after the light is withdrawn, the gas returns to its original

inactive state, and requires as long an insolation before the maximum action

is again reached as in the case with the original gas. This fact is of itself

sufficient to disprove Draper's statement that this active condition of the gas

Wewhen once brought about by the action of light is permanent.  have

also convinced ourselves by experiment, that the supposition of a non-per-

manent allotropic modification of either gas as an explanation of this phae-

nomenon is untenable. The gases evolved by the electrolysis of hydrochloric

acid were collected separately, and after each gas had separately traversed a

tube which could be exposed to direct solar rays, the gases were allowed to

mix, and were then passed into the apparatus. On examining the action of

lamp-light on the mixture, no difference in the rapidity of the action could

be perceived between the sensitive gas, the constituents of which had been

separately exposed to direct sunlight, and that which had not been previously

insolated. From these experiments it is seen that the explanation of the

phsenomenon of photochemical induction is not to be sought iu any

allotropic modification of either gas.

The effect produced by the presence of small traces of foreign gases upon

Wethe induction is very remarkable.     have found that the sensibility of

the gaseous mixture depends entirely upon the absence of every trace of

foreign gas. The retarding action of oxygen upon the mixture is the most
marked ; the addition of one per cent, of this gas to the chlorine and hydro-
gen mixture reduced the amount of action to -g^gth ; and the presence of a
mere trace of this gas (probably not more than loVoth per cent.) diminished
the action to one half of the normal amount. Excess of either chlorine or
hydrogen was found to act in the same manner, but not to such a remarkable
extent. This retarding action of oxygen accounts for the very great length
of time which it is necessary to lead the gas through the apparatus before
"the maximum action is attained.

   The diminution of the sensibility of the chlorine and hydrogen mixture
when foreign gases are present, gives a very accurate measure of the cata-

lytic action effected by such gases.

The simple relations which exist between the amount of hydrochloric acid

formed by the action of the light and the time of exposure, and amount of

Welight, were first observed by Draper.  have confirmed his results in this

respect, and have proved that both laws hold good for diffuse solar as well

as for lamp-light. The relations are the following :

1. The amount of chemical action effected by a constant source of light

is directly proportional to the time of exposure.

2. The amount of chemical action effected by the light in equal times, is

directly proportional to the amount of light.

(These laws are of course only applicable when the phaenomena of induction

have been fully eliminated.) A third relation which we have established is,

that the amount of chemical action varies inversely as the square of the di-

stance between the source of light and the sensitive mixture.

The experimental diflSculties which accompany the examination of the

relations existing between the amount of action and the mass of the gas, are

of so peculiar and considerable a nature, that although we have been occu-

pied for more than a month upon this branch of the subject, we have not as

Weyet succeeded in arriving at the law which regulates the action.  have,

however, already proved that after the light has passed through a certain

depth of the gas, it is no longer capable of causing a combination to take

place ; and we have further proved that the depth at which the light ceases

to act upon the mixture is very different for light from various sources.

Differences in this respect have not only been found in light from different

sources, but the diffuse solar light reflected from a perfectly cloudless sky is

found to differ, not only in the quantitj, but also in the quality of the chemi-

cal rays according to the sun's altitude. These interesting observations are

not complete, but the results as yet obtained give promise of further import-

ant I'elations being established between the nature and amount of the

chemical rays falling upon the earth's surface at various periods of the day.

      Reduction of the Chemical Action of Light to an Absolute Measure.

   The difficulty of obtaining any constant terrestrial source of light threw
great obstacles in the way of reducing the chemical action of light to an
absolute measure. The normal source of light which we have chosen for

the calibration of our instrument (fig. 1 ), is a flame of pure carbonic oxide gas
streaming from a large (3 millims in diameter) platinum burner, and issuing

under a constant pressure of half a millimetre of water. By measuring the
volumes of gas burned by different-sized flames and observing the chemical
action produced, it was found that even with the homogenous flame of carbonic
oxide, the chemical action increases in a greater ratio than the volume of
gas burned. This relation between the action produced and the volume of

                                                                          f2

certain limits we can calculate the amount of action produced by burning

the unit volume of gas issuint; at a given rate. We call the unit amount of

action for any instrument that produced by burning a cubic millimetre of
carbonic oxide at the distance of one millimetre from the sensitive gas, issuing
under the above-mentioned circumstances.

the chemical rays, we hope to have the honour of laying before the Section

On the Trigonometry of the Parabola, and the Geometrical Origin of
   Logarithms. By the Rev. James Booth, LL.D., F.R.S. &)C.

                    [A Communication ordered to be printed among the Reports.]

When engaged, some years ago, in researches on the geometrical properties

of elliptic integrals, the results of which appeared in two memoirs printed in
the Philosophical Transactions for 1852 and 1854, 1 was led to discuss a par-
ticular case of a cardinal theorem in the theory of elliptic integrals. Cer-
tainly no discovery was anticipated in matters so long known and thoroughly
investigated as the theory of logarithms and the properties of the parabola.
The propositions I now bring before the Section are, I believe, entirely new
and as they open a field of research in a department of geometrical science
studied by every mathematician in the course of his reading, I thought the
discussion of them might not prove unacceptable to the Mathematical Section

of the British Association.

                                                                                         Section I.

   I. Let the angles w, tp, and x^ which we shall call conjugate amplitudes, be
connected by the equation

               tan w=tan0secx+ tanxsec^                                                                                                          (1)

Hence to is such a function of ^ and x as will render

               = x+x]tan                                                                                      xtan sec (j>.
                            l_(j),
                                                                                         t^'" sec

We must adopt some appropriate notation to represent this function.                                                                              Let
                                                                                                                                                 (2)
the function [^, xl be written (^-"-X) so that                                                                                                   (2)

               tan ((p-'- x)= tan ^secx+ tan xsec^.

This equation must be taken as the definition of the function ^-^X'
   In like manner we may represent by tan (<{>-rx) the expression

                    x"tan (j) sec                                                        tan x sec f.

From (1) we obtain

               sec w=sec(0-^x)=sec 0secx4- tan^tanx

If we now differentiate the equation

                    = +tan 0) tan ^ sec x tan x sec 0,

we shall have

                    cos'(j)                                                                                         cos X
                                                                                 w

ON THE TRIGONOMETRY OP THE PARABOLA.                                                69

Adding these expressions together, and introducing the relation established

in (2), we find

                 _dig d<^            <^X                                            (5)

                                  COS (p COS X

This is the differential equation which connects the amplitudes w, ^, and x-

As w, ^, and x are supposed to vanish together, we shall have by integration,

                 r_rf<u_^r_rf^ r_^.                                                 ^5^

                 J cos (1) J cos ^ J cos X

or in the more compact notation,

                 +(* sec w(?w=lsec0c?^ i'secxФ?X                                    и (^)*

Hence if w, ^, and x are connected by the relation assumed in (1), we shall

have the simple relation between the integrals expressed in (5).

II. If in (1) we make the following imaginary substitutions, that is to

say, put '^-- Isina for tan^, '^^-- lsin/3 for tanx. 'V-- Isiny for tan w,

+cos a for sec 9, cos /? for sec X) cos y for sec w, and change -^ into             and -r

-- y= =into , we shall have sin
                 sin(a+/3) sinacos/D+ sin /3 cos a, the well-

known expression for the sine of the sura of two arcs of a circle.

  We shall show presently that an arc of a parabola measured from the

vertex may be expressed by the integral j*sec0(/y, Q being the angle which the

normal to the arc at its other extremity makes with the axis, or the angle

between the normals drawn to the arc at it? extremities.

   -- and -r may be called logarithmic plus and minus. As examples of the

analogy which exists between the trigonometry of the parabola and that of

the circle, the following expi-essions in parallel columns are given ; premising

that the formulae marked by corresponding letters may be derived singly,

one from the other, by the help of the preceding imaginary transformations.

In applying the imaginary transformations, or while tan is changed into

V-- -- V--\1 sin tp, sec into cos (p, and cot^ into                                 cosec 0, -^ must be

-- --changed into +, and -r into ; as also \sec(j)df into ^-v If.

   The reader who has not proceeded beyond the elements of trigonometry

may assume the fundamental formula as proved. He will find little else that

requires more than a knowledge of plane trigonometry.

   * The relation between the conjugate amplitudes lo, <p, and x, was originally obtained in
this way. In the theory of elliptic integrals, any three conjugate amplitudes are connected

by the equation

                 = --X--cosa) cos0cos
                                  sin0 sinx 'V 1 i^sin-

╗ is called the modulus. When we make i=0, we get

                 = -- 0+Xcos w cos cos X sin sin % ^'^ '^=                          i^^ the trigonometry of

=the circle. When we take the complement of 0, or make i l, we get

                 x+ =secw= sec ^ sec
                                  tan tanx '^^ '^ <p-^x

in the trigonometry of the parabola. Whence, as above,

                 = x+tan oj tan sec  tan x sec 0.

       I hardly need to remind the advanced reader, that this is the imaginary transformation

         иf-

by which we are enabled, in elliptic functions of the third order, to pass from the circular
form to the logarithmic form, or to pass from the properties of a curve described on the sur-
face of a sphere to its analogue described on the surface of a paraboloid of revolution. See

   IV. An expression for the length of a curve in terms of a perpendicular/?

let fall from a fixed point on a tangent to it, and making the angle d with a line
passing through the given point or pole, is found in most elementary works,
namely s=^pdd+i. In the following figure,

                           jo=ST, e=VST, Ф=PT.

                                                          Fig.l.

   Let n(>rt . 6) denote the length of the arc of a parabola whose parameter
is 4╗i, measured from the vertex to a point at which the tangent to the arc

is inclined to the ordinate of that point to the axis by the angle 6. When
m=l, the symbol becomes 11(0).

   In the parabola whose equation is i/'^4;}nx, the focus S is taken as the

pole, and therefore p:=m sec d : while PT, or t^m sec d tan d.

   The arc of a parabola, measured from the vertex, may therefore be ex-

pressed by the formula

m+n(╗j . 6)=m sec tan 6  I sec 6 dd.

   The difference between the arc and its subtangent t may be called the

tangential difference.

    For brevity, and for a reason which will presently be shown, the distance
between the focus and the vertex of a parabola will be called its modulus.
Hence the parameter of a parabola is equal to four times its modulus.

  VBV. Let n(m . lo), U(m . ^), U(m . x) denote three parabolic arcs VD,
VVC, measured from the vertex of the parabola. Let, moreover, to, tj), and

X be conjugate amplitudes. Then

n(╗i. w)=╗itan oj sec w+wifsec wrfw

n(╗j .0) =wjtan0 sec^ + mj sec^i >.   (V)

                    n(OT.x)=╗i tan^secx+^j sec^^^x

+Whence, since Jsecwrfw =Jsec^c?^ ("360 x^^X' because w, ^, and x are

conjugate amplitudes, we get, after some reductions,

            --n(╗j. (!>)-- n(m.^) II(╗J.x)=2╗^tanwtan0tanx. . . (8)

It is not difficult to show that

         -- --tan w sec w tan (p sec ^ tan ^ secx=2 tan w tan (j> tan )^.

Substitute for tanw, sec w, their values given in (1) and (2). Write

--(sec^  tan" 0) and (sec^x~t^░"x) ^^r 1, the coefficient of tan sec ^ and

tan X sec x io the preceding expression, and we shall obtain the foregoing

result.

VI. Let y, y"J/', be the ordinates on the axis of the parabola of the ex-

y=2mtremities of the arcs n.(m . w), n(m . (p), and U(m . x)- Then              tan w,

y ==2 m tan 0, y"=2m tan x- Therefore 2m tan w tan ^ tan x ^MJ^.

We have therefore the following theorem :

T/ie algebraic sum of the three conjugate arcs of a parabola, measured

from the vertex, is equal to the product of the ordinates of their extremities

divided by tlie square of the semiparameier.

   To exemplify the preceding theorem. Let

         tanw=2,                                      1             Vl

and these values satisfy the fundamental equation of condition,

and m, V5'=2m tan w tan <p tan x-
   VII. If we call an arc measured from the vertex of a parabola an apsidal

arc, to distinguish it from an arc taken anywhere along the parabola, the pre-

ceding theorem will enable us to express an arc of a parabola, taken any-
where along the curve, as the sum or difference of an apsidal arc and a right

line.

VCD VThus, let
         be a parabola, S its focus, and                                        its vertex. Let

VB=n(╗i.0), VC = n(m.x), VD=n(╗i.w), and let^^^^=/Ф. Then (8)

= VD--shows that the parabolic arc (VC + VB) arc                    A ; and the parabolic arc

VD-VB=BD=VC+/Ф.

nVIII. When the arcs U(m . (p) and (m . x) together constitute a focal arc,

or an arc whose chord passes through the focus, 0-|-x= -, and h is the ordi-

nate of the arc VD. Accordingly we derive the following theorem :
   Any focal arc of a parabola is equal to the difference beticeen the conjugate

apsidal arc and its ordinate.

an angle of 30░ with the axis, we get cos w=i, or y=\Om. Here, therefore,

the ordinate of the conjugate arc is ten times the modulus.

IX. When ^=X' (8) is changed into
              ....n(OT.w)-- 2n(m.^)=2mtanwtan"^;
                                                                          (10)

w=2or as tan  tan </> sec 0, see (?j) of III.,

              n(m.w) -- 2n(m.0)=4mtan^<^sec^                              (11)

Let ^=45, then n(╗╗.-^ is the arc of the parabola intercepted between

+the vertex and the focal ordinate; and as sec w=sec(^-J-0)=sec20 tan^0,
we shall have, since tan 0=1 and sec 0= V^, sec w=3 ; therefore

              n(m.sec-i.3)-2nf╗╗-y=4'mV2.

Now as sec a)=3, tan w=2 ╗/% and the ordinate Y=4m'/2^we may there-
^mV%fore conclude that the parabolic arc, whose ordinate is               diminished by

this ordinate, is equal to the arcs of the parabola between the focal ordinate

produced both ways, and the vertex.
    X, It is easy to give an independent proof of this particular case without

the help of the preceding theory.

   The length of the parabolic arc whose amplitude is 45░ will be found by

the usual formula to be

              n(╗w.^j=W'/2+OTlog(l+A/2);
--76 REPORT 1856.

and twice this arc is

    2n(m.^)=?w2V'2 + ?wlog(3+2\/2);since(l+\/2)2=3 + 2V2.

The parabolic arc whose amplitude is sec-^ 3, is found in like manner to be

               n(m.sec-i3)=╗i3.2'/2 + mlog(3+'/2).

Subtracting the former equation from the latter,

           n(m.sec-i3)-- 2n(Ф╗.^)=4m\/2.

YNow the ordinate of the parabolic arc whose amplitude is sec~' 3 is equal to

                                   2m.2'/2=4'm'/2,

therefore  jj(m . sec"' 3)-m{m.^\ =Y.

It is easily shown that 4╗j \^2 is the radius of curvature of the extremity of
the arc whose amplitude is 45░.

   XI. To find a parabolic arc which shall differ from twice another parabolic
arc by an algebraic quantity, may be thus exemplified.

= =Let
           tan 2,  tan w 4 V^S,

           = w=sec V 5, sec 9,

then          n(m .sec-i 9)=╗w36'V/5 + ╗ilog (9 + 4 i^S)
           2n(wJtan-i2)=2wj 2 4/5 + m log (2+ ^^5)%

Consequently, since (2+ '/5/=9 + 4V'5,

      n(?w.sec-'9)-- 2n(╗J.tan-i2)=;w32\/5=2mtanwtan^0. . (12)

WeXII.     may in all cases represent by a simple geometrical construction the

ordinates of the conjugate parabolic arcs, whose amplitudes are <(>, Xj and w.

Let BC be a parabola whose focus is S and whose vertex is V. Let

                   Fig. 3.

VS=w; moreover, let VB be the arc whose amplitude is f, and VC the arc
           ON THE TRIGONOMETRY OF THE PARABOLA.                   11

иwhose amplitude is x* At the points V, B, C draw tangents to the parabola;
they will I'orm a triangle circumscribing the parabola, whose sides represent

the semi-ordinates of the conjugate arcs VB, VC, VD.

WeXIII.    know that the circle circumscribing this triangle passes through

the focus of the parabola. Now

VT=╗?tan0, VT'=╗itanx╗ T'A=m tan ^secx╗ TA=m tan^sec^;

hence

            T'A + TA=m(tan ^sec x+ tan xsec<|)),

therefore

                    mtanw=T'A + TA.

When VB, VC together constitute a focal arc, the angle TAT' is a right

angle.

  mThe diameter of this circle is sec ^ sec x-

   The demonstration of these properties follows obviously from the figure.

   XIV. It may be convenient, by a simple geometrical illustration, to show

the magnitude of the functions sec(0-'-x) and tan (^-^-x)-
                    ABBSV=0, the line
Let SV=╗J,  ASV=x,                       being at right angles to SV.

ABSThrough the three points     describe a circle.  Draw the diameter SC,

Aand join the point C with and B. Let fall the perpendicular CT.

                                Fig. 4.

  Then ╗Jsec(0-Lx)=SC + CT, and m tan (0-i-x)=AC + CB.
  +Moreover also it follows, since sec(0-J-x) tan (0-i-x)=(seC(^+ tan^)
+(sec X tanx), as has been established in (6) of (III.), that

             ╗i(SC + CT+AC + CB)=(SB+BV)(AS+AV). . . (13)

   Of this theorem it is easy to give an independent geometrical demonstration.

  We have manifestly also

            CT(SC + m+SA+SB) = (AC + AT)(BC + BT). . . (14)

  When there are five parabolic arcs, whose normal angles 0, ^, ╗//, v, Q, are

                    n(OT. w) -- n(m .0) -- n(w . x) = 2?ntan w tan (/>tan ^.

Hence, adding these equations, Tl(m . oi) will disappear, and

     n(╗n.<j) -- n(m.0) -- n(m. x) -- n(m.i^)=2m tana>[tana(tani^+ tan^ tan x}-

Now                                              =tan w tan (w-i-v^).

Therefore                                        =tan w wtan sec >//-)- tan >// sec w.

XVII. Let, in the preceding formula (16), ^=x='/') ^"d we shall have

       =n(m.(D) -- 3n(m.(^)=2mtanX0-J-x) 16mtan^0sec^^.

We are thus enabled to assign the difference between an arc of a parabola
=whose amplitude is w (^-^0-^0) and three times another arc.

If in (ct) (III.) we make ^=j^=;p,

                          tanw=4tan^0 + 3tan^                                   (20)

Introduce into this expression the imaginary transformation

        V--itan(^=              sin 6, change -- into +,

30=-- +and we shall get sin
                          4 sin^9 3sin d, which is the known formula for

the trisection of a circular arc. (20) may therefore be taken as the formula

which gives the trisection of an arc of a parabola.

   XVIII. The following illustration of the triplication of the arc of a para-

bola may be given :

  Y mTake the arcs whose ordinates and y are 4w2 and respectively. Let

w and (j) be the amplitudes which correspond to these ordinates ; then as

and as  Y=2mtan o3=4;m, tana)=2, secw=\/'5;

Now these values of tan uj and tan satisfy the equation of condition (20),

namely

                          + 0=4 tan' ^ 3 tan  tan w.

But

since                     /H-V^^\'                 /-

and we get

have therefore the following theorem

    The arc of the parabola ivhose ordinate is equal to im, or to the abscissa,
diminished by the radius of curvature of its extremity, is equal to three times
the arc ivhose ordinate is m, or onefourth that of the former arc.

   It is evident that the cliord of the greater arc is inclined by an angle of 45

to the axis, or the ordinate is equal to the abscissa, while in the lesser arc the

ordinate is four times the abscissa.

   This is the point on the parabola up to which the ordinate is greater than
the abscissa; beyond this point it is less than the abscissa.

   XIX. Another example of the triplication of the arc of a parabola, or of

finding an arc, which, diminished by an algebraic quantity, shall be equal to

three times another arc, may be given.

Let

                       tan0=3-- , tanw=18,

                                              _ /--
                                =-/Is
                       sec(fi=                , sec w 5 V 13.

These values satisfy the equation of condition,

                          + 0=4 tan^ 3 tan    tan w.

Hence

       n(╗i.tan-i.l8)=OT90. VIs + w log (18 + 5 VlS)

       =m--^n(╗i.tan-╗-j                      +rn\og\-^ j;

and three times this arc is

       =^^^Sn (wi . tan- 1)                   + m log ( 1 8 + 5 ^TS),

                       1

since

                       (?▒^)^=18 + 5^T3.

Therefore subtracting the latter equation from the former,

n(/w.tan-q8)-3n('m . tan-i = ╗╗!Бi^^=16m(^|)'(^) . (22)

   XX. To find the arc of a parabola which shall differ from 7i times a given
arc by an algebraic quantity, may be thus investigated :

Let be the amplitude of tlie given arc, then

                  + +n(m.(^)=msec(/) tan                      tan

and n times this arc is

               +7iW{m . (p)=nm sec (p tan f+mlog (sec tan (p)".

Let    -^0-и-(/)  -J-  to w terms =il>, then

                  n(m.*)=msec$tan $ + m log (sec 4> + tan $).

   If we now inquire what, in the circle, is the magnitude of the trigonome-
trical tangent of the arc which differs from its subtangent, by the distance
between the vertex and its focus ; or, as the subtangent is in the circle, and
the focus is the centre, the question may be changed into this other, what is

the trigonometrical tangent of the arc of a circle which is equal in length
to the radius? This question would be answered by putting I for ;& in (a),

By this process we should get, in functions of the numbert of Bernoulli, the

value of tan (1), as is shown in most treatises on trigonon)etry.

Let us now make a like inquiry in the case of the parabola, and ask what

is the value of the subtangent of the amplitude which will give the difference

between the arc of the parabola and tliis subtangent equal to the distance

Nowbetween the focus and tlie vertex of the parabola.                    if be this angle,

      ON THE TRIGO>fOME'rRY OF THE PARABOLA.                                             83

The corresponding arc of the parabola will be given by the following series:
      -- --^n(?n . e)=2/Фri +
                  ^^     L      123  ^+     122:334455  +^  1223344.55667  &C.1,

m --e=since the subtangent in this case is equal to sec e tan                 (^^ e~^)-

                                                                           4

XXIII. If we now extend this inquiry, and ask what is the magnitude of the

amplitude of the arc of the parabola which shall render the difference between

this parabolic arc and its subtangent equal to n times the distance between

the focus and the vertex, we shall have, as before, by the terms of the question,

                         n(m .6) -- m sec tan d=nm.

But, in general,  -mn(m. 6) see 6 tan d=m^ sec Odd;

hence we must have

          =n=: rsec6rf0 log(sec9+tan6), or sec0+ tan 0=e".

Now we may solve this equation in two ways; either by making n a given
+number, and then determine the value of sec tan d, which may be called
the base; or we may assign an arbitrary value to sec 0+ tan 9, and then

derive the value of fi. Taking the latter course, let, for example,

                  secO + tan0=lO, thenФ=loglO;

or putting S for this angle, secS+tang=10                                         (27)

   Hence as every number whose logarithm is to be exhibited must be put

under the form sec 0+ tan 0, which is of the form l+x, since the limiting

value of sec is 1, we discover the reason why in developing the logarithm

of a number, the number itself must be put under the form 1+x, and not

simply under that of x.

XXIV. Given a number to find its logarithm, may be exhibited by the fol-

lowing geometrical construction                             Fig. 5.

  Let SVP be a parabola. Through

the focus S draw the perpendicular SQ

Vto the axis VS. Through let a tan-

gent of indefinite length be drawn,

which may be called the scalar. On this

VNtangent take the line  to represent

the given number. Join NS, and make

the angle NST always equal to the
angle NSQ. Draw TP at right angles

to TS. This line will touch the para-

bola in the point P, and the arc of the

parabola VP diminished by the sub-

tangent PT, or the tangential difference

for the arc VP, will be the logarithm
of VN.

The line SN makes the angle (-- + -]

with the axis of the parabola.

When SN'=VS= the unit m, the angle N'SQ is equal to half a right

Tangle. Hence the point in this case will coincide with V. The parabolic

=arc therefore vanishes, or the logarithm of I is 0. When sec 0+ tan                     1,

0=0.

  NWhen the number is less than 1, the point will fall below N' in the
Tposition n. Hence wSQ is greater than half a right angle. Therefore

will fall hehw the axis in the point T' ; and if we draw through T' a tangent

                                                                              g2
--84 REPORT 1856.

T'p, it will give the negative arc of the parabola Vp, corresponding to the

number V?^. Fractional numbers, or numbers between + I and 0, must
~therefore be represented by the expression Фi(sec
                                                          tan 0), since tanfl

changes its sign.

NSQWhen the number is 0, n coincides with V, and the angle      in this

case is a right angle. Tlierefore the point T' will be the intersection of VT'

and SQ. Hence T' is at an infinite distance below the axis, and therefore
+0 --the logarithm of
                   is go .

Hence the tangential difference due to the amplittide 6, is the logarithm of

+the number sec 6 tan 6.

Consequently it follows that negative numbers have no logarithms, at least

no real ones ; and imaginary ones can only be educed by the transformation
so often referred to, and this leads us to seek them among the properties of

the circle. For as always lies between and a right angle, or between

+and the half of +7r, sec   tan 6 is alicays positive ; therelbre negative num-

bers can have no real ov parabolic logarithms, but they may have imaginary

or circular logarithms ; for in the expression

                   log{cosS-+ V^sinS}=^V'^,                             (28)

-- --^=we may make
                   +(2m 1)^-, and we shall get log( l)=(2w+l)7rv' 1-

Hence also, as the length of the parabolic arc TP, without reference to

the sign, depends solely on the amplitude 0, it follows that the logarithm of

-- Wesec tan is equal to the logarithm of sec \- tan 0.   may accordingly

infer that the logarithm of any number is equal to the logaritiim of its reci-

procal, with the sign changed, since (sec 0+ tan 0) (sec 0-- tan 0)=1.

+ 0=2When is very large, sec     tan nearly. It follows, therefore,
                            tan

if we represent a large number by an ordinate of a parabola whose focal

distance to the vertex is 1, the diiference between the corresponding arc and

its subtangent will represent its logarithm.

  >Since VT + TP arc VP, therefore

                    VT > arc VP-TP > log VN.

VTHence   +or tan is always greater than the logarithm of (sec  tan 0) in

the Napierian system of logarithms. This may be shown on other principles :

                  +\ sec (od<i)=p q, and w=(^-'-x*

Hence it' f be the amplitude which gives the tangential difference =p, and
X the amplitude which gives the tangential difference =g, ^-^x i^ the am-
=pplitude which will give the tangential difference                                            + q. In the same way

we might show, that if ;// be the angle which gives this difference =r,

=p +(0-i-X-J-i//) is the angle which will give this difference                                         g+r.

Let   a  be  the  amplitude  of the  number A,  and                                            p  its  logarithm                                      /3 the
                                                                                                                                                   ;

amplitude of the number B, and q its logarithm ; r the amplitude of the

number C, and c its logarithm. Then

         A=seca + tana, B=sec/3+ tan/3, C = secy+tany,

and log A=p, log B=q, log C=r, or

                      p+q + r= log A + log B + log C.
  We have also

            = + + +ABC (sec a tan a)(sec ^ tan j3)(sec y tan y)
                 = +sec (a-i-/3-Ly) tan (a-^/3-^y).

a+Now as j9 is the logarithm of sec  tan a, q the logarithm of sec /3+ tan /3,

y+r the logarithm of sec  tan y,

A+p q+r is the log of sec(a-L/3-^y)+ tan(a-L/3-i-y), or of B C,

Weas shown above.  may therefore conclude that

                   log (ABC)=log A + log B + log C                                                                                                    (29)

   XXVI. If e be the angle which gives the difference between the parabolic

arc and its subtangent equal to ?n, (e-'-e) is the angle which will give this
difference equal to 2m, (e-^e-'-e) is the angle which will give this difference

equal to 3m, and so on to any number of angles. Hence, in the circle, if ^

be the angle which gives the circular arc equal to the radius, 2^ is the angle
which will give an arc equal to twice the radius, and so on for any number
of angles. This is of course self-evident in the case of the circle, but it is
instructive to point out the complete analogy which holds in the trigonome-
tries of the circle and of the parabola.

   Hence the amplitude which gives the difference between the parabolic arc
and its subtangent equal to the semiparameter is given by the simple equation

                             sece'+tane'=e2                                                                                                           (30)

And more generally, if e" be the amplitude which gives the difference between

the parabolic arc and its subtangent equal to n times the modulus, we shall

^^^^                         =sece''+tane'' e╗                                                                                                        (31)

In the same way it may be shown that if e^ be the angle which gives the

difference between the parabolic arc and its subtangent equal to -th part the

modulus, we shall have                                                                     i^

                             sece^+tane^=e"                                                                                                           (32)

Let the difference be equal to one-half the modulus, then w=2, and

^ec (+ tan e^=e .
                                          +--                            == --

--86 REPORT 1856.

This is easily shown.

Let e^-i-e^=e. Then sec(e^-^e;)^sece=sec░ej+ tan-e^, and

Therefore                tan (ey-^ey)= tan e=iisece^tan e^.

               +sec ( e^ -^ e^) tan (e^-'-e^)=sece+tane=e=
               + + = +sec* e^ tan^ e^ 2 sec e^ tan e, (sec e^ tan e^)".

Hence          sec6(+ tan e;= V^e                                        (33)

                          2'

           taii(e-^e)=tel^, 8ec(e^e)=^l▒^;

           tan(e-Le-^6)= ^  ~^    -, sec(e-^e-^e)= ^ "'^^ ;

tan(-^e-L- to n terms)= '                 --sec(e-Le to n terms)=^ -S

Therefore      +2 sec e tan e= tan (e e)

               =2sec(e-Le) tan (e-Le) tan (e -^ e ->- e -^ e),

and generally  и

               2 sec(e-^e-'- to Ф terms) tan (e-^e-^ to Ф terms)

               tan (e-^e-^e-'-e-^ to 2w terms).

   Now 2 sec (e -- e -i- to n terms) tan (e-'-e-^ ton terms) is the portion of the

tangent to the curve intercepted between the axis of the parabola and the
point of contact whose amplitude, or the angle it makes with the ordinate is
(e-L-e-^ to n terms;, while tan (e-^e-^e-^e-^ to 2n terms) is half the ordi-
nate of that point of the curve whose amplitude is (e-^e-^e-^e to 'in terms).

Hence we derive this very general theorem :
    That if tivo points be ttiken on a parabola such that the intercept of the

tangent to the one between the point of contact and. the axis shall be equal to
one-half the ordinate to the other, the amplitudes of the two points tvill be

(e-i-e-L to Ф terms) and (e-^e-^e-^e to 2n terms) resjjectively.

This theorem suggests a simple method of graphically finding a parabolic

arc whose amplitude shall be the duplicate of the amplitude of a given arc.

Let P be the point on the parabola whose amplitude is given. Draw the

=tangent PQ meeting the axis in Q. Erect VT at the vertex PQ. Through

T draw the tangent TP', the amplitude of the arc VP' will be the duplicate

of the amplitude of the arc VP, or {d-^Q-^ to n terms) and {B-^d-^ to 2n

VPterms) will be the amplitudes of        and VP' respectively. Vv'e may there-

fore conclude that in the circle

           2cos(<i + 0+ to n terms) sin (9 + 9+ to n terms)

               + ++sin(0 e        to 2w terms).

  XXVIL In the trigonometry of the circle, the sine of the arc, which is x

times the radius, is given by the formula

                                  x^ x^                x' .
               ^sm x^=x                                          , &c.,
                                   и  -I
                                                 1234567
                            123 12345

and the cosine of the same arc by the formula

This suggests the analogous theorem, that if ^ be the angle or amplitude

former, and such that its vertical focal distance shall be m'. The numbers

their subtangents in the two parabolas will give the logarithms in the two

system.s, of the scmte number drawn upon the scalar ; for as all parabolas, like

circles, are similar figures, and these are confocal and similarly placed, any

line drawn through their common focus will cut the curves in the same angle,

and cut off proportional segments. Hence the two triangles SPT and Srarr

--PVare similar, and the tangential differences      PT and zsv--wt are propor-

tional to 4m and 4//*', the parameters of the parabolas.

                                Fig. 6.

Let log denote the Napierian logarithm, and Log the decimal logarithm of

the same number.

We may therefore conclude that the modulus of the decimal system is the

decimal logarithm of the Napierian base e.

in the ratio of log 10: 1. Hence, as is well known, the modulus m' of the

decimal system is tiie reciprocal of the Napierian logarithm of 10.

   It is therefore obvious, that as any number of systems of logarithms may be

represented by the differences between the similar arcs and their subtangents
of as many confocal parabolas, the logarithms of the same number in these
different systems will be to one another simply as the magnitudes of the para-

bolas whose arcs represent them, that is, as the parameters of these parabolas.

Accordingly the moduli of these several systems are represented by the halves

of the semiparameters of the several parabolas.

   The Napierian parabola differs from the decimal and other parabolas in
this, that the focal distance of its vertex is taken as the arithmetical unit, and
that the scalar line on which the numbers are set off is a tangent to it at its

vertex.

   Hence if m, the vertical focal distance of the Napierian parabola, be taken
as 1, the vertical focal distance m' of the decimal parabola is . 4342 &c., or

if m=l, m'-- .4342 &e.
   XXIX. In every system of logarithms whatever, the logarithm of 1 is 0.
   For when the point T coincides with V, the corresponding point r will coin-

cide with V, whatever be the magnitude of its modulus m'. It is obvious that
the circle whose radius is unity is analogous to the parabola whose vertical
focal distance is unity, and that the Napierian logarithms have the same
analogy to trigonometrical lines computed from a radius equal to unity, which
any other system of logarithms has to trigonometrical lines computed from a
radius r. As we may represent different systems of trigonometry by a series

of concentric circles whose radii are I, r, r' &c., so we may in like manner
exhibit as many systems of logarithms by a series of confocal parabolas
whose focal distances or moduli are 1, m', m" &c. The modulus in the

trigonometry of the parabola corresponds with the radius in the trigonometry
of the circle. But while the base in the trigonometry of the parabola is real,
in the circle it is imaginary. In the parabola, the angle of the base is given

+by the equation sec0 tan0=e. In the circle, cos 04- a/-- 1 sin0=e«V^^;

and making 0=1, we get

             cos(l)+A/^risin(l)=eV^                       (35)

Hence, while e^ is the parabolic base, e'^~ is the circular base. Or as

+ a/^[sec e tan e] is the Napierian base, [cos(l)+  sin(l)] is the circular

or imaginary base. Thus

             V^+[cos (1 )  sin (l)]a=cos Sr+ ^T-i sin ^.

We may therefore infer, speaking more precisely, that imaginary numbers

Wehave real logarithms, but an imaginary base.  may always pass from the

real logarithms of the parabola to the imaginary logarithms of the circle by

Vchanging tan into --\ sin ^, sec into cos ^, and e^ into e^~^

   As in the parabola the angle is non-periodic, its limit being \k, while in

the circle ^ has no limit, it follows that while a number can have only one
real or parabolic logarithm, it may have innumerable imaginary or circular

logarithms.

as in the preceding figure, draw, measured from the vertex, a series of lines

Hence the parabola enables us to give a graphical construction for the angle
+ +(0_L0j-0 &c,) as the circle does for the angle (0
                                                       &c.).

I XXX. The analogous theorem in the circle may be developed as fol-

Alows: In the circle SB take the arcs

            AB=BB,=B,B,^=B,,B,,, ... &c. =2^.

DLet the diameter be    then

                      ;

       SB=Dco9.&, SB,=Dcos23^,         SB,(=Dcos3^ ... &c.,

and                                     =AB^, Dsin 3^ ... &c.

           AB=Dsin:&, AB(=Dsin2&,

  Now as the lines in the second group are always at right angl es to those
in the first, and as such a change is denoted by the symbol V--l, we get

SB + BA = D{cos&+ v/^siiid},

SB; + B^A=D{cos2^+ =-v/^^sin25-} D{cos&+ V-lsind}'';
V^+SB;; B,,A=D{cos3a+ \/^sin3^} = D{cos^+
                                                       sin*f&c.

SB^+B,,A=DCcosn3'+ i/ITi sinw^] = D[cos.&+ \/^siua]"-

When the points B', B" fall below the line SA, the angle becomes negative,

and we get

SB' -- B'A=cos.&-- v/ -- Isin^
       V^ V^SB" -- B" A= cos 2^--
                                     sin 2b= [cos ^--  sin b^-

Therefore

           log(SB + BA)=log(cos*+V-lsin&)=^V-l. . . .(36)

Let ^=1, then

                      log[cos(l)+\/-lsin(l)]= V --1.

Hence generally ^ \^^^ is the logarithm of the bent line whose extremities
are at S and A, and which meets the circle in the point B, ASB=.&.

    It is singular that the imaginary formulae in trigonometry have long been
discovered, while the corresponding real expressions have escaped notice.

--Indeed it was long ago observed by Bernoulli, Lambert, and by others the

remark has been repeated in almost every treatise on the subject since--
that the ordinates of an equilateral hyperbola might be expressed by real
exponentials, whose exponents are sectors of the hyperbola ; but the analogy,
bein'' illusory, never led to any useful results. And the analogy was illusory
from" this; that it so happens the length and area of a circle are expressed
by the same function, while the area of an equilateral hyperbola is a function
of an arc of a parabola, as will be shown further on. The true analogue of

the circle is the parabola.

circle, considered under this point of view.
   In the parabola, the points T, T,, T,,, which divide the bnes

into their component parts, are upon tangents to the parabola. The corre-
sponding points B, B,, B, in the circle are on the circumference of the circle.

   The analogy between the expressions          for  parabolic
be seen by pStting the expressions under        the  following                                 forms :--

+Circular arc log (cos 0+ ^/~l sin 0)^~i- subtangent =0. . (37)

The locus of the point T, the intersections of the tangents to the parabola
with the perpendiculars from the focus, is a right line ; or in other words,
while one end of a subtangent rests on the parabola, the other end rests on a
right line. So in the circle ; while one end of the subtangent rests on the
circle the other end rests on a cardioide, whose diameter is equal to that ot
SPAthe circle, and whose cusp is at S.

and the point P on the parabola is the pole of the tangent -mr to the circle.

VP--As the parabolic arc  PT is the logarithm of the number VN, so the

circular arc Atzr is the logarithm of the bent line Atsr+nrS.

   The locus of the point r, the foot of the perpendicular from S on the tan-
gent to the circle at cr, is a cardioide whose cusp is at S, and whose diameter

is that of the circle.

    While the circle is the 2)olar reciprocal of the parabola, the cardioide is its

+inverse curve ; for the cusp polar equation of the cardioide is |0=2r(l cos0),

                                                                                                  2w2

while the focal equation of the parabola is p^= -j--; -; hence p|0^=4m^

    Since the parabola and the circle are reciprocal polars one of the other, the
circumference of the circle passing through the focus of the parabola, we
have been able by the help of this reciprocal circle to give geometrical repre-
sentations, as in XII. and XIV., of the properties of the trigonometrj' of the

parabola.

 --There is this further analogy between the properties of the circle and those

of the i^arabola, that as the arc which is equal to the radius subtends no
exact submultiple of any number of right angles, however large, so in the
parabola the angle or amplitude which gives the tangential difference or
logarithm equal to the modulus is incommensurable with any number of right
angles. In the former there are 206265 seconds, in the latter there are
178575 seconds*.

   The theorem given above, that a parabola is the reciprocal polar of a circle
whose circumference passes through its focus, suggests a transformation
which will exhibit a much closer analogy between the formulae for the recti-
fication of the parabola and the circle, than when the centre of the latter

curve is taken as the origin.

the angle or arc (1), and the angle e which gives the tangential difference equal to the mo-

ASB=^; and let D, as before, be the diameter of the circle. Through B
draw the tangent BP ; let fall on this tangent the perpendicular SP=p, and

let BP, the subtangent, be equal to t.

   Now asj9=Dcos"S, and <=Dsin ^cosS^, as also the angle ASP=2S-, if

we apply to the circle the formula for rectification in IV., we shall have

the arc

              AB=s=2DJcos2^6?^-- Dsin^cosS-                     (38)

The subtangent to the circle, which is exhibited in this formula, disappears

in the actual process of integration ; while in the parabola, the subtangent
which is involved in the differential is evolved by the process of integration.

   As in the parabola, the perpendicular from the focus on the tangent bisects

the angle between the radius vector and the axis of the curve ; so in the

circle, the radius vector SB drawn from the extremity of the diameter, bisects
the angle between the perpendicular SP and the diameter SA.

   It is easily seen that while the line SB makes the angle with the axis, the
line SP makes the angle 26, and the perpendicular SR on the tangent to the

cardioide makes the angle 30 with the axis.
   Hence if we take the reciprocal polar of the cardioide, the line drawn per-

pendicular to the tangent at any point on the curve trisects the angle between

the axis and this radius vector. Consequently the polar reciprocal of the

cardioide is a curve, such that if a point be taken anywhere on the curve,

and a perpendicular be drawn to the tangent at this point, it will trisect

the angle between the axis and the radius vector drawn to the point of con-
tact. Hence the reciprocal polar of the cardioide enables us to trisect an
angle, in the same way as a parabola gives us the means to bisect it.

                                                           (I cos 6).

-- -- =Let jO= , then as cos d=p^ and    -/IMV, ^ and v being the tangential

coordinates of the curve, we shall have

Consequently  l(p^y^)-p^y--p^(^+y^)=o                           (39)

is the tangential equation of the reciprocal polar of the cardioide. The
common equation of the cardioide, the cusp being the pole, is

              .....l(^+f)-rxy-f^(x'+f)=0.                       '(40)

   The reader will observe, that the equation between the coordinates x and
y of the cardioide is exactly the same as the equation between the tangential

coordinates E and v of the reciprocal polar of the cardioide.

the parabola.

the parabola, and whose transverse axis is the parameter of the parabola.

The area of this curve, the elements being taken parallel to the axis, or

the area between the curve and the vertical axis passing through V, is

found by integrating the value of xdy.

=Hence the hyperbolic area VAQR 2mll(m. 0).                                  (42)

Therefore as the hyperbolic area is equal to a constant multiplied into the
corresponding arc of the parabola, the evaluation of the hyperbolic area
depends on the properties of logarithms.

   It also follows, from what
has been established in the pre-
ceding part of this paper, that
hyperbolic areas may be multi-
plied and compared according
to the laws which regulate pa-

rabolic arcs.
    Let (p and 6 be the angles in

which the normals to the cor-
responding points of the para-
bola and the hyperbola cut the
axis, then if (p and 6 be these
angles, it is easily shown, since

=VQ normal at Q, that

     0=tan  sin 0. . . (43)

This expression will enable

us to express the hyperbolic

area in terms of the angle which

the normal to the hyperbola

makes with the axis instead of

the parabolic amplitude ; for as the parabolic amplitude is related to the

normal angle of the hyperbola 6 by the equation tan 0=sin (p,

Since a is greater than 1, let a=sec0, and let be divided into n angles 0,

WeXL.                           might pursue this subject very much further, but enough has

been done to show the analogy which exists between the trigonometry of the
circle and that of the parabola. As the calculus of angular magnitude has

always been referred to the circle as its type, so the calculus of logarithms

may in precisely the same way be referred to the parabola as its type.

   The obscurities which hitherto have hung over the geometrical theory
of logarithms are, it is hoped, now removed. It is possible to represent

logarithms, as elliptic integrals usually have been represented, by curves de-

vised to exhibit some special property only ; and accordingly such curves,
while they place before us the properties they have been devised to represent,

fail generally to carry us any further. The close analogies which connect

the theory of logarithms with the properties of the circle will no longer appear

inexplicable.

   To devise a curve that shall represent one condition of a theory, or one

truth of many, is easy enough. Thus, if we had first obtained by pure ana-

lysis all the properties of the circle without any previous conception of its

form, and then proceeded to find a geometrical figure which should satisfy
all the conditions developed in the theory, we might hit upon several geome-

trical curves that would satisfy some of the established conditions, though

not all. That all lines passing through a fixed point and terminated both

ways by the curve shall be bisected in that point, would be satisfied as well

by an ellipse or an hyperbola as by a circle. That all the lines passing

through this point and terminated both ways by the curve shall be equal,

would be satisfied as well by the cusp of a cardioide as by the centre of a

circle                          but no curve  but  the circle will fulfil all the analytical conditions of
                             ;

the theory of the circle.

In the same way, no curve but the parabola will satisfy all the conditions

of the arithmetical theory of logarithms.

The equilateral hyperbola gives a false analogy and leads into error, because

to base the properties of logarithms on those of the equilateral hyperbola

leads to the conclusion that negative numbers have real logarithms.

--100 REPORT 1856.

   Tte foregoing theory decides a controversy long Carried on between
Leibnitz and J. Bernoulli on the subject of the logarithms of negative num-
bers. Leibnitz insisted they were imaginary, while Bernoulli argued they
were real, and the same as the logarithms of equal positive numbers. Euler
espoused the side of the former, while D'Alembert coincided with the views
of Bernoulli. Indeed, if we derive the theory of logarithms from the pro-

perties of the hyperbola (as geometers always have done), it will not be easy

--satisfactorily to answer the argument of Bernoulli that as an hyperbolic

area represents the logarithm of a positive number, denoted by the positive
abscissa+.r, so a negative number, according to conventional usage, being
represented by the negative abscissa-- .r, the corresponding hyperbolic area

should denote its logarithm also. And this is the more remarkable, because
by Van Huraet's method the quadrature of the hyperbola itself depends on
the rectification of the parabola, as shown in XXXV. All this obscurity is

cleared up by the theory developed in the text, which completely establishes
the correctness of the views of Leibnitz and Euler.

    It is somewhat remarkable in the history of mathematical science, that
although the arithmetical properties of logarithms have been familiarly known
to every geometer since the time of Napier, their inventor, or rather dis-
coverer, no mathematician has hitherto divined their true geometrical origin.

And this is the more singular, because the properties of the logarithms of
imaginary numbers are intimately connected with those of the circle. No
satisfactory reason has been shown why this should be so. The logarithmic

curve which has been devised to represent one well-known property of loga-
rithms, is a transcendental curve, and has no connexion with the circle.
Neither has any attempt been made to show how the Napierian base e, an
abstract isolated incommensurable number, may be connected with our

known geometrical knowledge. Had the circle never been made a geome-

trical conception, the same obscurity might probably have hung over the
signification of tt, which has hitherto concealed from us the real interpreta-
tion of the Napierian base e.

   This affords another instance, were any needed, to show how thin the veil
may be which is suflicient to conceal from us the knowledge of apparently

the simplest truths, the clue to whose discovery is even already in our hands.
The geometrical origin of logarithms and the trigonometry of the parabola
ought, in logical sequence, to have been developed by Napier, or by one of
his immediate successors. They had many indications to direct them aright
in their investigations. So true it is that men, in the contemplation of remote
truths, often overlook those that are lying before their feet

    I have shown in this memoir that the theory of logarithms is a result of the
solution of the geometrical problem to find and compare the lengths of arcs
of a parabola, just as plane trigonometry is nothing but the development of
the same problem for the circle. I have shown, too, elsewhere*, that elliptic
integrals of the three orders do in all cases representthe lengths of curves which
are the symmetrical intersections of the surfaces of a sphere or a paraboloid
by ruled surfaces. These functions divide themselves into two distinct groups,
representing spherical and paraboloidal curves, and by no rational trans-
formation can we pass from the one group to the other. The transition is
always made by the help of imaginary transformations, as when we pass from
the real logaritiims of the parabola to the imaginary logarithms of the circle.

When we take plane sections of those surfaces, that is to say, a circle and a

Transactions for 1852, p. 316.
         ON MOLLUSCA OF THE NOETH-EAST ATLANTIC, ETC. 101

parabola, the theory of elliptic integrals becomes simply common trigono-

metry, or parabolic trigonometry with the theory of logarithms.

   These views will suggest to us the reflection, how very small is the field
of that vast region, the Integral Calculus, which has hitherto been cultivated
or even explored ! When we find that the highest and most abstruse of
known functions, not only circular functions and logarithms, but also elliptic

integrals of the three orders, are exhausted, " used up," in representing the

symmetrical intersections of surfaces of the second order, who shall exhibit
and tabulate the integrals of those functions which represent the unsymme-

trical sections of surfaces of the second order, or generally those curves of
double curvature in which surfaces of the third and higher orders intersect ?

Considerations such as these but add fresh evidence to the truth, how small
even in mathematics is the proportion which the known bears to the
unknown !

   In revising this memoir for publication among the Reports of the British

Association, I have supplied several numerical examples to illustrate the theory.

I have added some new theorems, such as the curious properties of the
polygon of n sides circumscribing the parabola, p. 95 ; the theorem which

connects the corresponding points of the parabola and the equilateral hyper-
bola, p. 94 ; a new trigonometrical form for the roots of a cubic equation,
p. 81 ; and the geometrical expressions for the 2n roots of a trinomial equa-
tion, in the excepted case, by the help of parabolic trigonometry, p. 99.

Report on the Marine Testaceous Mollusca of the North-east Atlantic
    and neighbouring Seas, and the physical conditions affecting their

   development. By Robert MacAndrew, F.R.S.

 In the following Report, prepared in compliance with a wish expressed by
 the Committee of the Natural History Section of the British Association at
 the Glasgow Meeting last year, I have endeavoured to embody the results
 of personal research, obtained principally by means of the dredge, at various
 intervals during the past twelve years.

   The field of my labours has extended from the Canary Islands to the North

 Cape (about 43 degrees of latitude), and with reference to the following
 Tables, it should be explained that when a species is stated to extend north-
 wards to the latter, or southwards to the former of these limits, it is not to be
 inferred that it does not range further ; and this it is more important to bear
 in mind, because a large proportion of the Mollusca inhabiting the coasts of
 Finmark are known to be widely distributed in the Arctic Seas, while a con-
 siderable number of the Canary species extend to, and in some cases attain
 their maximum of development in, the tropical region.

    myIt is hardly necessary to add, that even within the district to which

 observations have been confined, many species of mollusca are recorded to
 have been obtained which it has not been my good fortune to meet with or
 identify, and that of all such I have taken no note.

ON MOLLUSCA OF THE NORTH-EAST ATLANTIC, ETC. 133
--134 REPORT 1856.

Additional Observations which could not be conveniently embodied in the
                                                 foregoing Table.

--Saxicava arctica, Lin. Absent from no district witliin the range of my re-

      searches, but is much more frequent and larger in tiie northern than in
      the southern latitudes. The large solid variety, now living only in the

Arctic seas, is found dead (fossil ?) in deep water on the coasts of

         Scotland.

--Gastrochaiua modiolina. Lam. ; Gastrochisena cuneiforrais, Lam. Not ha-

       ving been able to detect any specific difference between the British spe-

cimens and those from the south of Europe, 1 treat them as identical.

In the Canaries the specimens are smaller and inhabit greater depths

than in other localities.
--Ceratisoleu legumen, Lin.
                             Is of much smaller size in southern localities
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

        frequent at Malaga, but not eastward in the Mediterranean.

--Donax anatinus, Lam. I have dredged abundantly from 15 fathoms on the

   --Dogger Bank, a remarkable exception from its ordinary habitat.

Donax venustus, Poli. Is closely allied to Donax a7iatinus, of which it

      takes the place at Lisbon, Mogador and in the Mediterranean ; in latter
      associated with D. truncidtis.

--Tellina solidula, Pulleney. Is reported to be frequent in the Mediterranean,

but I have never met with it south of Britain,
Da --Mactra subtruncata,
         Costa. There are two distinct varieties (? species),

the one larger, solid and strongly rudely striated concentrically, is sub-

littoral, and most abundant on some of the Scottish shores ; the other,

small, smooth and thin, is more generally distributed, both as regards

       depth and climate.

--Venus striatula, Don. On the Mediterranean coasts of Spain and to the

southward, it is comparatively rare and confined to deep water ; in the

British seas it frequents all the zones of depth.
-- AAstarte arctica. Gray.
                            valve obtained from west of Zetland, 50 fathoms,

by Prof. E. Forbes and myself, and recorded in the ' British Mollusca,'

myis in  possession, and I have every reason to believe it to be fossil.

The reasons which induce me to believe that this species is not an actual

inhabitant of the British seas are, that it is a shallow-water species,

very gregarious, and not met with on the coast of Norway, south of

        the Arctic Circle.

--Astarte compressa, Mont. Subject to great variety in form, size, &c. I be-

       lieve A. Banksii to be only a variety of this species.

--Kellia suborbicularis, Mont. I incline to think that there are two species in-

       cluded under this name, if not, they are well-murked varieties ; the one
      smaller, more orbicular and more pellucid ; the other much larger, more
      elliptical and, when fully grown, less transparent. It is the last which

   --is found imbedded in very fine mud contained in dead bivalves.

Cardium edule, Lin. Varies greatly in size, form, number of ribs, &c.

Near Tunis a narrow neck of land divides the bay from a shallow salt-

water lake, at the head of which the city of Tunis is situated ; on the one
side of tiiis neck of land (that facing the bay) all the specimens of Car-

dium edule were strong, triangular, and with few ribs, while on the side

towards the lake, they were thinner, wider and much more numerously

   --ribbed. The northern varieties attain the largest size.

Modiola Petagnae, Scacchi In shallow water in the harbour of Carthagena,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1

                free. In the Canary Islands, at 12 to 15 fathoms, small and distorted,

       --imbedded in NuUipore.

       Crenella discors, Lin. The largest British specimens I have obtained were
              on the north coast of the Isle of Man, 10 fathoms. At Southampton

                 the pale green variety is frequent about low-water mark, adhering to the
               leaves of Zostera marina. Near Tromsoe in Finmark it is most abundant

              in beds covering the under surfaces of ledges of rock. Though reported
               to be found in the Mediterranean I have not met with it south of the
                British Channel, and believe it to have been confounded with C. costu-

                lata by Mediterranean authors.
       Lithodomus caudigerus, Sotv The authors of the ' British MoUusca ' state

               that this is a South American species. It is frequent on the coast of

I Asturias, Bay of Biscay, also at Faro iii the south of Portugal, at low
               water burrowed in limestone rocks, but not found in the south of Spain
                or Mediterranean, where its place is occupied by L. dactylus. I have

               never obtained them together in any locality.
       Pecten Jacobseus, Lin Notwithstanding that this species is named after the

                Saint of Compostella, I have not been able to detect it on the coasts of

       --Galicia, or the north of Spain.

        Pecten Danicus, Chem. This species would appear to have been formerly
             much more abundant on the west coasts of Scotland than it is at pre-
              sent; as the number of dead valves bears no proportion to that of living
               specimens. It is met with throughout the Hebrides, but is most fre-

             quent in Loch Fyne, the normal form in mud at about 70 fathoms, the

               smaller and strongly striated variety upon hard ground at about 40
               fathoms. It is extremely rare in Finmark, and I only met with small

       --dead specimens north of Drontheim.

        Pecten Islandicus, Milller. Is doubtless extinct in the British seas, though

                dead valves are frequent in the Firth of Clyde, Hebrides, Zetland,
              Murray Frith and North Sea. In Norway, north of Drontheim, it is by

                far the most abundant species of Pecten.

    --Anomia ephippium, Lin. Unlike most testaceous mollusca, which only re-

              quire to be better known to be esteemed as delicacies for the table, the
            Anomia is not to be eaten with impunity. On one occasion, having
            sent my yacht round from a neighbouring port to that of Villaviciosa in
            Asturias, where I purposed joining her after an excursion inland, my

                crew, having been told that there wfere oysters in the harbour, determined

            to dredge on their own account in my absence, and procured abundance
              of the Anomia in large agglomerated masses. Seeing by the complexion
             of the animals that they were not cof/tMon oysters, only one of the men

               would venture upon eating them, and he suffered in consequence severe
               vomiting, &e., with swelling of the abdometi, from which he did not

               entirely recover for two or three days.
                 The most beautiful yellow and purple varieties are found in the sunny

                 seas of the Mediterranean.

    --Ostrea edulis, Lin. Subject to much variation, tvhich has occasioned the

               making of one or two questionable species, and rendered uncertain the
             limits of its distribution. The common English or Welsh oyster is, how-
                ever, certainly abundant and of excellent quality at Redondela, situated at
              the head of Vigo Bay ; and I have likewise dredged it off Cape Trafalgar
               in sand, and off Malaga in mud, but have not noticed it further eastward

                 in the Mediterranean.

    --Chiton fascicularis, Lin. ; Chiton discrepans, Brown. I must acknowledge

            my inability to discriminate satisfactorily between these species.
--136 REPORT 1856.

--Chiton cancellatus, Sav. Is more nearly allied to C. Bissoi of the Mediter-

        ranean than to C. asellus, of which it has been supposed to be a variety.

--Chiton fulvus, Wood. This fine species differs as much in its habits as in

       ajipearance from its European congeners. It enjoys greater powers of

      locomotion than any other Chiton of my acquaintance, creeping freely

in the sand between tide marks in Vigo Baj% where it is very abundant,

and where several were found adhering to the chain cable every time

it was raised from our anchorage abreast of the town of Vigo. It is,
nevertheless, extremely local, not recorded to be obtained in any locality
but those I have named, unless from Patagonia, whence there are spe-

cimens in the British Museum under another name, but in no way to be

       distinguished from the present species.

--Chiton Cajetanus, Poll. Inhabits the Mediterranean and Bay of Biscay, but

has not been detected in any intermediate locality, nor on the south

   --coasts of Spain.

Patella vulgata, Lin. Becomes a local species on the northern coasts of

   --Norway, and I did not meet with it in Finmark.

Patella pellucida, Lin. The distribution of this species is regulated by that

of the Laminaria, on which it feeds. It is not unfrequent in the north

       of Spain ; is absent from the south of Spain and Mediterranean, but
       unexpectedly appears again in the harbour of Mogador, where it is of

   --small size. In high northern latitudes it is much paler in colour.

Patella Gussonii, Phil. Among some hundreds of dead specimens I only

       took one or two living, and these were upon a deep-water red fucus.

--Calyptrsea Sinensis, Lin. I have never obtained British specimens in less

than 8 or 10 fathoms, whereas on the coasts of Spain it is generally

       found about the sea margin, and in shallow water.

--Trochus crenulatus, Phil. I believe to be specifically distinct from T. exi-

      gutis, is subject to great variation in colour ; the grey variety is more
      common to the eastward.

--Trochus millegranus, Phil. Of this species there are two very distinct

varieties, of which the smaller and more conical inhabits the Mediterra-
nean and south coast of England and Wales, while the larger is common

to the north-west coasts of Britain and Norway.
-- ARissoa abyssicola, Forbes.
                                specimen received from Captain Spratt,

   --dredged by him in 3,50 fathoms, about 40 miles from Malta.

Turritella communis, Risso. The ordinary British form is wider in propor-

    Ation and possesses fewer volutions than that of the Mediterranean.

large variety with numerous volutions is found in Cork Harbour and in

Bressa Sound, always in shallow water, while the ordinary variety in-

habits all the zones of depth. I have taken white specimens of both

the forms, consequently absence of colour is not always the consequence

        of great depth.

--Couus Mediterraneus, Brug. Is very frequent at Lancerotte, but does not

       extend westward to Teneriffe or to the Salvage or Madeira Islands.

--Purpura lapillus, Lin. Though generally littoral, inhabits the depth of 8 or

10 fathoms in certain localities, and in these cases undergoes consider-

able modification of form; from deep water and mud, it is large and

fusiform, from 8 fathoms and rough ground the specimens are beauti-

        fully imbricated.

Ringicula auriculata, Menhe.--Ki Vigo, the northern limit of its range, it

attains the greatest dimensions and is very abundant, but not striated as

   --in the Mediterranean and Madeira.

Nassa trifasciata, A. Adams. Most abundant at Vigo, but smaller than in
ON MOLL.USCA OF THE NORTH-EAST ATLANTIC, ETC. 137

the Mediterranean ; in latter district it undergoes considerable variation

   Da --in colour.

Fusus gracilis,
             Costa. Notwithstanding the opinion of Middendorf,

adopted by Forbes and Hanley, that this is only a variety of F. Islandicus

of Chemnitz, I am quite satisfied of the contrary after obtaining the

true Fusus Islandicus in the neighbourhood of the North Cape, It

was from about 100 fathoms, and measured 4-^ inches in length, while

adult specimens of Fusus gracilis from the same locality did not measure

2^more than  inches in length.
--Spirula Feronii, Lam. This shell, possessing a peculiar aptitude for floating

on the surface of the sea when dead, is liable to be drifted to localities

Avery remote from its native habitat.  chance specimen has occasion-

ally been picked up on the shores of Britain ; on the south coast of the

Bay of Biscay it is still rare, is more frequent at Gibraltar and Malaga,

and abundant in the Canary Islands. I am not aware of its having been

found in the eastern Mediterranean.

   cal range of the species and the number obtained in each of the districts.

                                          Concluding Observations.

   The acephalous or bivalve Mollusca possess generally a capacity to exist

through a greater bathymetrical range than univalves, several species of the
former being to be found in all the zones of deptii from the margin of the
sea to a hundred or more fathoms, and it is these same species which are most
widely distributed geographically, as might indeed be reasonably inferred, it
being evident that the depths of the ocean can be comparatively but slightly
affected by changes of temperature and of climate, and that, consequently, a
species removed to a distance northward or southward from its most congenial
habitat, would encounter less change in climatal conditions by seeking a
greater depth.

    Those species which inhabit a great vertical range, such as Saxicava arctica,
 Venus striatula, Venus ovata, Lucina borealis, &c., have generally their max-

imum of development and attain their greatest dimensions in shallow water
and I call the attention of geologists to this fact as it may occasionally be of
service in determining the depth at which strata have been deposited. An-

other importantpoint, deserving attention on account of its bearing on geology,
is the modifications ofgrowth, incident to all the ijidividuals taken from a great

depth, as compared luith individuals of the same species taken from a moderate
depth. Some of these vary in different species, but the general characteristics
of deep-water specimens are deficiency of colour and of solidity, and small-

ness of size.
    Northern species generally diminish greatly in size as they approach

southern latitudes ; but the converse of the rule cannot be so generally applied
to southern species, for while some of these are smaller, others increase in

dimensions as they approach the northern limit of their range. As examples
of the latter, 1 may mention Ringicula auriculata and Mactra rugosa, which
attain their maximum size in Vigo Bay, Haliotis tiibercidata in Guernsey, and
Tellina balaustina in the West of Ireland and the Hebrides.

   To give an idea of the comparatively small number of species existing in
high northern latitudes, I may mention that I obtained 50 per cent, more of
species in the Canary Islands than in the northern provinces of Norway,
although I bestowed at least thrice the amount of time and labour in dredging
the latter, under more favourable circumstances, and through a greater range

of latitude.

    The correct division of the marine Mollusca into provinces, or as they are
called " Faunas," is a subject deserving consideration, as it may be of assist-
ance to us in our endeavours to become acquainted with the laws regulating

the distribution of species.

    The Arctic and Tropical faunas are tolerably well defined by the zones
after which they are named, except that the former, on the European side of
the Atlantic, recedes a few degrees within the Arctic Circle, in consequence
of the current which sets northward along the coast of Norway. It is the
division of the temjierate zone into the Boreal, Celtic, and Lusitanian or
Mediterranean provinces, which offers some difficulty, and I take the liberty

of submitting the fellowing suggestions with reference to it.

   Two sets of Mollusca of very different type advance from the sub-arctic

and sub-tropical regions towards each other. In the course of their progress
each loses by the way many of its most characteristic members, which one
after another become extinct, so that when they reach their point of contact,
the species are comparatively few in number, and not the most characteristic
of their northern or southern origin. In order to remedy this state of things
and to accomplish an equable distribution of Mollusca throughout the tem-
perate zone, it is necessary that there should exist an intermediate fauna,
 pervading more or less the ground occupied by both the others, and having
                                  --

--158 REPORT 1856.

its principal development at their point of meeting, and this I believe to be
neither more nor less than what actually occurs. The point at M'hich the north
temperate or boreal, and the south temperate faunas meet, I conceive to be
about lat. 50░, or at the British Channel, which marks the limit of some of
the most characteristic northern forms, viz. Buccinum undatum, Fusus
antiquus, Cyprina Islandica, &c., as well as of the genera Haliotis, La-
chests, Cah/ptrcea, Venerupis, Gastrochccna, Auricula, and numerous species

of southern type. Supposing my view to be correct, it is at once seen why

there can be no peculiar species in the Celtic (or as I would rather call it),
the English or intermediate fauna. It is difficult to lay down an exact line
of division between one animal province and another, the transition being

gradual; but I would consider the "intermediate" fauna to be contained
between the 45th and 55th parallels of latitude, which will include the larger
portion of the Bay of Biscay and a considerable part of the North Sea. All

species which attain their maximum of development within these limits I
would consider legitimately to belong to it, and among the most characteristic
of these may be mentioned Purpura lapillus, Natica nionilifera and iV. nitida,
Trochus zizyphinus. Lacuna piiteolus, L. pallidula, all the British Pholades,
Mactra solida, Tellina ctassa, Pecten opercularis, P. pusio, and Venus stri-

atula.

    Although, as already stated, the transition from one fauna to another takes
place gradually, the change is much greater at certain geographical points
than at others, and the neighbourhood of Cape St. Vincent is remarkable as
the northern limit on the Atlantic coast of about a hundred southern species,

including the following genera :

Solemya.  Siphonaria.                 Ranella.     Conus and

Cardita.  Sigaretus.                  Mitra.       Cyprsea (except the

Chama.    Crepidula.                  Columbella.  sub-genus Trivia).

Spondylus. CancoUaria.                Pollia.

Though Cardita and Mitra reappear in the Polar seas represented each by

a single species, and Cancellaria under the form Admete. Cymha extends

to the neighbourhood of the rock of Lisbon ; Hingicula to Vigo ; Triton,

Turbo, Cassis, and Lithodomus to Asturias ; Adeorbis, Haliotis, CalyptrcBa,

Lachesis, Gastrochcena, Venerupis, Galeomma, aui.i Avicula to the south

coast of England.

   The circumstance of so many characteristic forms disappearing at Cape St.
Vincent, may perhaps be accounted for by the change which there takes place
in the direction of the coast and consequent set of the current. It will be
noticed that the disappearance of species is all in one direction, and that the
point in question is not known to form the southern limit of a single species;
also that nearly all the genera enumerated as not passing it are to be found

six or seven degrees further north in the Mediterranean.

  A circumstance analogous to what occurs at Cape St. Vincent takes place

about the South of Scotland with reference to northern forms of Mollusca.

Of 135 Norwegian species which extend to Scotland, no less than 42 are
absent from the South of England ; and this fact is, I conceive, to be explained
by the change in the nature of the sea-bottom, which may also account for
the circumstance that many species, and among them the peculiarly northern
forms of Trichotropis, Cemoria, and Pilidium, are common to the coast of
Norway and the Hebrides, and even extend as far south as the Clyde,
while they are altogether absent from, or but very rarely found upon the east

coast of Scotland.

   The Mediterranean fauna may be considered a branch of the north tem-

perate Atlantic, agreeing with it in its general character, though possessing

some peculiarities, a natural result of its isolated condition.

ON MOLLUSCA OF THE WEST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA. 159

Report on the present state of our knowledge with regard to the

   Mollusca of the West Coast of North America. By Philip P.
   Carpenter. ka^b/L

1. The duty of preparing a Report " On the present state of our know-

ledge of the Mollusca of California," was entrusted to the writer simply in

consequence of an opportunity which accident had thrown in his way, of

obtaining accurate information on the Mollusca of one spot only on the
Pacific shores of N. Ame'rica. Almost entirely destitute of technical know-

ledge, and living at a distance from collections and libraries, he would not

have ventured to undertake it but for the promised aid of one, whose early
death, just as he was entering on that field which seemed of all others most

adapted to develop his peculiar powers, still leaves a most deeply-felt void

in Malacological and Geological Science. This spot is neither politically

nor conchologically in California, strictly so called, but belongs in its fauna

to the province which culminates in the Bay of Panama and extends south-

wards to Peru ; while many shells of the real Californian fauna extend north-

wards towards Behring's Straits, and are found on the Asiatic coasts in the
Okhotsk Sea. This Report will therefore take cognizance of all that is known

of the Mollusca of the West Coast of North America, from the Boreal shores

to Panama.

Before results can be obtained of permanent value, and general deductions

drawn from them that shall bear on the great questions of the condition of

our globe in this and previous ages, it is necessary that the foundations

should be laid by patient and accurate examination of every minute point in

our inquiries : else, as the wrong measurement of a degree nearly prevented

Newton's elimination of the great law of gravitation, so the deficiency or

hasty examination of details respecting particular species and their abodes,

may lead the great master-minds of science to erroneous conclusions, which,

through their well-earned influence, retard rather than stimulate the progress

--of future research. It is proposed therefore (1) to state the physical con-
ditions, and the                be
                  cautions  to      observed  in the inquiry                                                    (2) to present the
                                                                                                             ;

different sources of information in historical order ; and (3), after tabulating

these geographically and zoologically, to draw such inferences as the present

state of our knowledge may warrant*.

* On receiving the request of the Association, I issued a circular seeking information as to--
   1. What species are found on the north-east shores of the Pacific, especially at Vancoaver's

Island.

      2. What near the mouth of the Columbia river, and in the Oregon territory.                                Oregon,
      3. What near San Francisco and Monterey.
      4. What near San Diego.
      5. What along the Pacific shores of the peninsula to Cape St. Lucas.
      6. What at La Paz, Guaymas, and other stations i7i the Gulf of California.
      7. What at Acapulco and other stations along the coast towards Panama.
      8. What species of land and freshvirater shells are found in different parts of
California, and West Mexico.

And, in order to compare with these, as to
   9. What species are found on the eastern (Atlantic) shores of Mexico.

 10. What at the Galapagos.
 11. What at the Sandwich Islands (distinguishing what are brought there from other

places).

12. What in Polynesia.

     13. What /ois27 species are found in the Tertiary deposits of the United States, which
may throw light on the existing Pacific species.

   This circular was sent to every accessible station on the West N. American coast, and to
naturalists in this and foreign countries. The replies are on most points extremely meagre
but I have pleasure in recording great obligations to Hugh Cuming, Esq., for the most liberal
--160 REPORT 1856.

    2. Perhaps no region in the world is so well adapted for the study of the

geographioal distribution of MoUusca as the W. coast of N. and S. America.

Shut out from the vast Indo-Pacific province which reaches to the Sandwich
and Marquesas Islands by an uninterrupted body of water almost equal in
extent to the whole Atlantic Ocean, on the other side barred against all

admixture with the Caribbean Sea by the mighty bulwark of Central Ame-

rica and Darien, it presents the least indented line of coast that the world
can show, from the frozen ocean of tlie north to a southern promontory 20░
south of the lowest extremity of the old world. Even the land fauna is sepa-
rated from that of the bulk of the continent by the great chain of the Andes
and the Rocky Mountains, and by the arid climate which prevails over a
large portion of its extent. Here then we enter upon a new type of marine
life, almost entirely distinct from those with which we have been familiar in
the Atlantic, Indian and Polynesian waters; in which we can pass, on each
side of the equator, from tropical to boreal conditions, with the most satis-
factory regularity. All that we miss is the presence of more oceanic islands ;
the solitary group of the Galapagos presenting data of unusual interest, to
be noticed afterwards.

   3. The tropical region of marine life extends much further north than
south of the equator. This is accounted for by the direction of the equato-
rial current, which, striking upon the swelling coast of Peru, sweeps round
the great Bay of Panama and Central America, and following the north-
westerly direction of the coast, is naturally driven up the narrow Gulf of
California, where, even at Guaymas, in lat. 27░, are found the conditions of
equatorial climate ( Gould). The long promontory of Lower California, from
lat. 23░-32░, offers a natural impediment to the further northward passage
of moUusks ; while the current which flows southwards, parallel to the
shores of temperate America, seems to convey many boreal species below
the latitude at which we should have expected them. The zoological tem-
perate zone therefore is curtailed in the northern and extended in the

with flat and concave surfaces, and gently sloping, precipitous, or shelving

sides." Each has its appropriate species, as have also the loose pieces of

tion in the sand. On the fine sand beaches, Oliva, Tellina, Donax and
Dosinia abound. On trees a little above half-tide level are found Pur-
piirce and LittorincB ; with numerous VeneridtB, Columbellce, Neritina picta
and Area grandis among the sticks and moss-like algae beneath. On ledges
of smooth basaltic rocks abound Littorince, Fissurellce, and SiphonaricE. In
a mangrove thicket at high-water mark occur Cerithidece, Cyrena, ArccB,
Polamomya:, Melampi, and "overhead, Littorina pidchra, almost as rare as
beautiful." The ordinary tides are 16-20 feet, very rarely 28 feet, leaving
many square miles of sea-bed exposed at the ebb. The bay contains several

steep islands, of which the best known is Taboga (C. B. Adams, Pan. Shells,
pp. 19-21). Mazatlan. On the north side of the bay is a "long neck of

narrow hills, [of primitive rock,] their sides exhibiting projecting crags and

deep indentations which the ocean has been lashing for ages. On the south

are rocky islands, but towards the south-west the harbour is open to the

broad Pacific, whence at times the sea rolls in with great fury " {BartletБ).

The harbour is in some places choked with shoals of large Pinnce, whose

sharp edges cut the boats (Belcher). Station has often much more to do

with the distribution of species than mere latitude : e.g. Venus gnidia is

found in muddy places from Peru to the Gulf of California, but is not

found on the prolific sandy floor of Acapulco harbour, where it is replaced

by the sand-loving V. neglecta. In some sandy situations, the dredge may

be used for hours without the smallest success ; while in others, where the

--floor is varied, a short search will procure more than fifty species (Hinds).
   California. Along the coast of Upper California are primitive rocks,

chiefly granite and syenite. Near Santa Barbara are cliffs of shell limestone,

perhaps 200 feet high ; but their contents have not been recorded. Brooks
with hot springs issue from the primitive rocks, and there are abundant

traces of huge geological convulsions (Nuttall), The peninsula is of vol-

canic rock, anjd exhibits great diversity of climate. When, near Cape St.

Lucas, the thermometer stands between 60░ and 70░, it may be found, near

the northern extremity, at the freezing point. The muddy marshes near

San Diego, &c., appear to be very prolific in bivalves ; as are the rocks in

Acmcece, which seem to culminate on this coast, whence they were first de-

scribed by Eschscholtz. " Observations on some points in the Physical Geo-

graphy of Oregon and Upper California, by Jas. D. Dana," will be found in

p. 376.

5. The Gulf of California (often, even in books of great pretension,

strangely called a bay) was discovered by a vessel detached from the expe-

dition of Cortez in 1533 (Dana), (1534, teste Hibbert). It was the Sea of

Cortez, and the Vermilion Sea of the early Spaniards. It is about 700 miles

long and from 40-120 wide. About the year 1697* it was colonized by a

party of Spanish Jesuits, who founded Loreto, La Paz, and San Jose on its

shores. The earliest shell known from its waters was the pearl oyster (Mar-

garitiphora fimbriata, Dkr.), to obtain which, about the seventeenth century,

the Spaniards employed from 600 to 800 divers ; the value of the pearls ob-

tained annually being estimated at 60,000 dollars. So exhausting was this

traffic, that the fishery is now almost entirely abandoned. Occasionally,

however, a ship-load of pearl shell is sent to Liverpool, and sold for manu-

facturing purposes. Among the sweepings from one of these loads was found

the finest specimen known of Placunanomia pernoides, remarkable for its

reappearance on the Gambia coast. There appears to have been a treaty

with Spain as far back as 1786, allowing of some trade between this country

and the Mexican shores ; but there is no trace of much intercourse before

the Declaration of Independence in 1821. In 1826 a direct treaty was
formed between England and Mexico, and from that time the Californian

and W. Mexican coast has ceased to be a terra incognita to English natu-

ralists. Still, however, our knowledge of the shores and deep waters of the
Gulf (especially of its northern extremity), and of the peninsula of Cali-

fornia, is most fragmentary. The present Report contains the first account

at all verging towards accuracy and completeness, of the fauna at its mouth.

man Mr. Nuttall, incomplete as it is, remains the best list of that interesting

district ; and in spite of the old-established English settlement near the

Columbia River, it was left to the United States' Exploring Expedition to

make us even moderately acquainted with the shells of the Oregon district.
Of the abyssopelagic species in Oregon and California, we have only the

very limited collections of Belcher and Hinds ; and of the minuter forms,

which in the British fauna are 31 per cent., in the Panama fauna 13 p. c, and

in the Mazatlan fauna no less than 39 p. c. of the whole number of species,
we cannot reckon more than half-a-dozen names.

6. It might be thought that, in order to obtain suitable lists of the Mol-

lusca inhabiting particular localities, all that was necessary would be that

shells should be brought from that locality, and then described. But such

Ais far from being the case.  few of the principal causes of error, both as

regards habitat and description, will be noticed, in order that suitable cau-

tion may be observed in judging of the materials to be presented.
-- A7. Errors respecting habilat.
                                   large part of the shells in collections have

been brought from the seats of trade. Either persons at home, in their com-

munications with friends at sea-ports, request that shells may be sent back

or sailors bring them as an article of commerce. In both cases, the greatest

number of specimens is collected from all sources, and no dependence what-

ever can be placed on the results. Thus, well-known East Indian, Philip-

pine, and Polynesian shells have been sent from Acapulco and Mazatlan

and coast shells from various latitudes, including the Sandwich Islands,

occur in the Oregon collection of Lady K. Douglas. It is well if sailors and

captains do not add to the confusion by mixing together shells picked up at

different places on the voyage. Nor do the errors end here. When they

pass into the hands of dealers, it is rarely that the least attention is paid to
their locality. They are mixed in drawers in every possible confusion, and

instances have not been rare of traders coining habitats to suit the supposed

taste of their customers. Even when they have their eyes open to the im-

portance of accuracy, such are the circumstances of confusion attendant on

the management of their business, that correctness is rarely to be ex-

pected.

8. But even if collections have been made on a single spot by a traveller

of ordinary and even of conchological attainments, errors may arise from

shells imported in ballast, &c., and dropped on the shore. Adhering and

burrowing littoral shells may thus be found alive in places foreign to their
native seas. This may account for a specimen oi Acmcea pelta, abundant at

Oregon, being found with the Mazatlan Limpets ; and for Liitorina aspera

being given by Prof. Forbes in his zoological map as the characteristic spe-

cies of the Oregon instead of the Mexican fauna, specimens having probablj'

reached the northern collectors in the same wajr. As an aid to detect these

errors, it is very desirable that shells should be retained without being sub-

jected to the usual acid treatment, as the accretions, or the minute shells

among the dirt, will often decide a point that the shell itself will not deter-

mine. Thus, a small specimen of Fissnrella Barbadensis was separated from

a boxful of F. virescens (a variety of which in the young state it closely

resembles) by a minute Spiroglyphus and coral which seem peculiar to the

Atlantic Seas. Thus also specimens of Ostrea ii-idescetts with their Placu-

nanomice were confirmed in their African habitat, from the minute shells

between the laminae, which agreed with the African and differed from the

Panamic types. How many of these ballast species have found their way

into the well-searched British shores, is patent to the readers of Forbes and

Hanley's Hist. Brit. Moll. It is said that even the great Mediterranean
     ON MOLLUSCA OF THE "WEST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA. 163

Triton has been dredged with the animal in, off the coast of Guernsey*.
It is therefore very desirable that collectors should have a general acquaint-

ance with the shells of a variety of distinct provinces, in order that they

may be prepared to detect errors when they arise. For this purpose also
the formation of local collections in public museums is very greatly to be
recommended t-

   9. It might be thought that all sources of error would be avoided, when
competent naturalists themselves collect shells in their original haunts. But
when different places are visited, it is not always possible, in the confinement
of a ship, or amid the confusions of land travelling, to pack and tabulate
accurately the results of each branch of inquiry : or, supposing these errors
guarded against, intermixings may still take place in the unpacking and dis-
tribution of specimens. Moreover, when shells are left loose in cabinets,
and the information is supplied by ticket only, a variety of interchanges may
very unexpectedly take place. Such errors are most serious when they take

place in the collections of naturalists deservedly noted for their accuracy;
because whatever appears in their cabinets is naturally regarded as of un-
questionable authority. Thus, a Ceylon shell ran an imminent risk of being
described as from Mazatlan ; and specimens were found bearing one locality
on the ticket affixed to them, and another on a ticket within. Thus, also,

Prof. Adams notes;]: having received a Pleurotoma zonulata from Mr.
Cuming, as from the Philippines. Indeed, after the vast collections made

by that gentleman in so fruitful a locality, it was natural that shells should
be often assigned to this habitat, unless a contrary were known. The " China
Seas" or " Eastern Seas" of Lieut. Belcher are also supposed to have in-
cluded many chance acquirements; among othevs, Dosinia Dimkerihovai\ie
Panamic, and Semele rubro-lineata {j=- simplex) from the Californian fauna.

   10. All these errors, from whatever source derived, find their way into
the monographs, sometimes with additions by the writers themselves, and so
become perpetuated. Some authors, even in our own country as well as in

France, are not strict in regard to geographical boundaries. " Central

America" and " West Columbia" are used generally for the tropical portions

of the W. American coast, and " California" for any stations north of Aca-

pulco, either in the Panamic or the San Franciscan province. Mr. Reeve,

indeed (under Patella venosa, pi. 10. f. 18), extends W. Columbia south-

wards to include the Isle of Chiloe, in lat. ^?░, just as Valenciennes and
Kiener extend Peru northwards to include Acapulco. By mistake, Mr. Sow-
erby, jun., refers a Panama shell to Jamaica, when he cites Prof. Adams's
Cerithium validmn, and gives as tiie habitat oi Pattella nana and albofasciata,
P. Z. S. 1841, p. 52, "ad insulam Panama, Philippinarum."

    11. Another class of errors arises from confounding places which bear

the same name. Thus St. Vincent's may be either the island in the West

Indies or on the Guinea coast, according as it is used by Guilding or Tams.
San Bias may be either the near neighbour of Mazatlan in the Gulf district,

or it may be D'Orbigny's locality in Patagonia. And San Juan may be

either the bay on the Gulf side of the Peninsula of California, in lat. 27░, or
the Straits of San Juan de Fuca (or Fuaco), near Vancouver's Island. It i╗
believed that in Kellett and Wood's collections, the words de Fuca have

borough to a like importation.
    и|" Prof. E. Forbes had been collecting materials for a series of such collections at the University

of Edinburgh. It is hoped that they may yet be made available for the purposes for which

they were designed.

been added to papers from the former place; e.g. in Cyprcea arabicula,
(Bristol Mus.) and Planaxis iiigritella, both of which belong to the Gulf
fauna. In Mr. Reeve's account of Hinnites gigatiteus, Gray, the shell is
quoted from " California and the Straits of Juan Fernmidez," pi. 1. sp. 2.

   12. The errors of one collection, or of the author, are not confined to
books, but are continually repeated in public and private collections. It is
important, therefore, when shells are named from the monographs, that the

copied locality should be distinguished, say by marks of quotation. When
the locality of the actual specimen is known on authority, this may be under-

--lined ; and, where practicable, the authority should always be added.
    13. Errors of nomenclature. But supposing that the original materials
have been collected with perfect accuracy (and for the reasons above stated,
those collections are the most reliable which have been made by competent
observers on single spots or unmixed districts), a vast variety of errors will
probably arise before their nomenclature is suitably established.

    First, the works in which shells are described are inaccessible to ordinary
students. This arises in part from their being so expensive, that even pub-
lic museums are often unable to procure them ; and in part from species
being described in local journals or loose tracts, which either do not find
their way at all into general scientific literature, or do so with such tardiness
that their effect is simply to introduce the confusion of synonymy, and, by
appealing to an earlier date, to upset the labours of those who would most
thankfully have been spared the responsibility of description. This almost
limits the satisfactory production of original works to those who have frequent

access to the capital.

     14. Or, supposing the books obtained, the materials are found in so ill-
assorted a state, that the student's time is frittered away in finding out where
to look. It is customary with some writers to describe new species from any
genera or any localities, without the least regard to order. Thus every stu-
dent at work on the shells of any district is obliged to wade through the
"centuries" of new shells described by Philippi in the ' Zeit. f. Mai.,' for

fear of overlooking an already published species. Or even when the genera
 are monographed, the species are generally arranged either by accident or to-
suit the supposed elegance of the plate ; instead of either grouping them
 zoologically, so as to exhibit allied species side by side, or else geographi-
 cally so as to bring the species from each district together. For want of
 some such help, whole hours, which might have been spent in advancing
science, may be wasted in hunting for a single Cotius, a Voluta, a Helix, or
 a Mitra. As a help to the determination of species, the more minute divi-
 sion of large genera is by no means to be opposed ; the Lamarckian genera
 being to our present knowledge of species and animals what the Linnaean
 groups were in the times of Lamarck. It is greatlj' to be regretted that
 many of the divisions proposed of late years have been named in utter

 defiance of the principles of nomenclature which the British Association
 recommend, and which are generally received by the naturalists of this and^

 other countries.

     15. But supposing the materials found, it then appears that most of them'
 are in so unsatisfactory a state that allied species cannot be discriminated.-
 Some writers recomnund short descriptions to save time ; but much more
 lime is lost in the end by the errors to which they give rise. If any one-

 will study the synonymy of the CalyjitrceidcB in the British Museum Mazatlan

 Catalogue, they will i)e able to form some idea, though a very partial one^
of the labour that has been thus entailed. The consequence is that the
same name is often quoted by different writers for very different shells.
ON MOLLUSCA OF THE WEST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA. 165

which is a much greater evil than the giving of several names to one species.
Until, therefore, existing species are tabulated in such a way as to be recog-

nizable by students, it would appear a less evil in a doubtful case to de-

scribe a fresh species, than to run a probable risk of affiliating a different

shell to a species already constituted.

    16. Those identifications therefore are by far the most satisfactory which
are made by a comparison of types. But even here the student must exer-
cise caution. For if any one had searched last year for the types of Brode-
rip's Calyptrccidce (so obscure to the many who have not access to the plates
in the 'Transactions'), he would have found not only two of those species

nameless, and in imminent peril of re-description, and that too as from dif-
ferent localities from those recorded in the 'Proceedings' ; but he might have

observed the same name of Broderip given to two distinct species, neither of
which was the shell figured in the ' Transactions,' which still appears under

another name. On searching also for the types of shells described in the

'Proceedings,' within a few weeks after they had been communicated, the
names indeed were found, but fastened to very diff'erent shells from what the

author had intended. All these errors had arisen from the number-tickets

with the shells referring to the catalogues having been misplaced.

17. As human life is so short, and those who have the inclination for

scientific pursuits have generally so little leisure, it is a serious evil when so

large a proportion of that little has to be devoted to the labour of making

Weout the errors of predecessors.  therefore venture to suggest some points

which may be worthy of the consideration of the leaders in science. First,

whether the Government, which often spends large sums in the production
of important and expensive works, might not spend a portion of that sum in
presenting copies, or selling them at a reduced rate, to the various free mu-

seums and libraries in the country. Secondly, whether the British Associa-

tion (which has already catalogued the stars), or some other public body,

might not undertake the work of cataloguing the existing species in different

departments of natural history*. And thirdly, whether' a general registry

office could be agreed upon by naturalists of all nations, which might have

branch stations in the various capitals, and to which Latin copies of all de-
scriptions of new species should be sent, by every naturalist who wished to

retain the rights of priority ; to be accompanied by information where the
type specimen was to be found.

   18. But the foundation-point of all our inquiries must be the discrimi-

nation of species themselves as they exist in nature. And here those labour
under great disadvantage who can only consult the " especes de cabinet" in

which, for the sake of saving room, single or very few specimens are exhi-

bited ; since, in the case of variable species, it is quite easy to pick out
several extreme forms which shall apparently be even more distinct than

those which all allow to be separate species. Every description therefore

which is founded on single or extremely few specimens must be regarded as

only provisional, till their circumstances of variation are known. And

he, perhaps, is doing more useful work, who has obtained materials by
which a full knowledge of the variable powers of moUusks may be attained,
than he who only describes a number of single independent forms. Those

   * Or if this should be regarded as too great a work, the preparation of cheap digests of
species like Mr. Hanley's admirable ' Recent Bivalve Shells,' and figures intermediate

between those of Wood and the Monographs, are greatly to be desired. Now that Mr. Wood-

ward's text-book is making the study of MoUusks so popular, the need for such books of species
is becoming extensively felt. The publication also of cheap abstracts of expensive books, such

as are given in the ' Zeit. f. Mai.,' would be of great service to students.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

who would study species in a comprehensive manner might advantageously
consult the canons given in Dr. W. B. Carpenter's Researches on Orbitolites,

'Trans. Roy. Soc' 1855, pp. 226-2;!0. It must not be expected, however,
that creatures (comparatively speaking) so highly organized as mollusks,
should assume such abnormal forms as the lower animals and plants. Often
indeed one species will greatly vary, while another, closely allied, is constant
in its characters; or differences will be found between the shells of a single
species, which in another tribe would justly entitle them to generic separa-

tion. No general rules therefore can be given to guide the student. But it

is required of him that he should faithfully use all the materials at his com-
mand ; not being satisfied with an examination of particular forms, but care-
fully working- through those shells especially which many would cast aside
simply because they were puzzling, or were not fine specimens. Those
whose work lies mainly among picked collectors' shells are recommended to

study the series of fossils arranged by Prof. E. Forbes in the Museum of

Practical Geology, and the large suites illustrating particular species in the

British Museum Mazatlan Collection.
    19. It is, however, by no means recommended that we should abstain

from describing new forms, because it may afterwards be discovered that
they are conspecific with others previously found. The great point is, that
we should be guided in those matters that are least known by the experience
gained by studying carefully ascertained species in their varied develop-
ments ; and that we should not desire the maintenance of species simply
because they have once been published, when further light assigns to them
a subordinate place. Those vvriters are therefore not to be blamed who
have multiplied species simply from a want of sufficient materials. Thus
when C. B. Adams described as five distinct species the Ccecum pygmcEum,
diminutum, monstrosmn, eburneum, und Jirmatum, which seem only stages in
the development of the same shell, he did carefully, according to the then
state of knowledge, what a naturalist of less accuracy would have passed
over as one shell, simply from not having found out the differences. But
when the further discovery of many hundreds of individuals proves that they
are identical, a higher point of knowledge is reached, according to which all
examinations in the same group may be henceforth interpreted till some yet

higher generalization is attained.

    20. But when species are constituted or disregarded, simply in obedience
to a theory, injury is done to the progress of science. Thus a recent author
on the British Fauna appears unwilling to believe in the existence of species
other than what occur on the South Devon coast ; and accordingly unites
together many which have been constituted by the most accurate naturalists,
but which, from their northern station, he had not an opportunity of study-
ing. And on the other hand, the principal American conchologists, having
assumed a theory that no species can be found in two distinct provinces
unless we can see a way by which they may have moved from one to the
other, forthwith proceed to describe as new everything which makes its ap-
pearance on an unexpected side of the coast. Undoubtedly it is by far the
most easy way of studying a fauna merely to consult those works which
apply to that fauna, and to describe as new whatever is not found therein
but we must beware lest we be forcing Nature into our own form. Now,
just as we give a species already constituted the benefit of a doubt, wetill
be fairly able to prove its identity with anothei-, so we may suppose shells
different from opposite coasts, till we can prove them the same. But, in the
language of the late Dr. Binney*, " until the question of the identity of

these closely allied species has been decided by their anatomy, we believe

--it to be perfectly safe to adopt this axiom, that species, tohencesoever

Wederived, possessing the same characters, are identical.  view this to be a

more rational course than to consider them to be the analogues of each

other; a convenient but very indefinite mode of expression, which may be

used to cover every degree of similitude, from a general analogy to a close

affinity hardly admitting of distinction*."

21. As far as facts already ascertained justify us in drawing any conclu-

sions, it would appear that while the shells in each of the great provinces

throughout the world are in the main remarkably distinct from each other,
there are in each fauna (1) many shells which are parallel with those from
other seas ; (2) some which are nearly ubiqviitous, and often extend far
back in geological age ; and (3) others which, though by no means widely
diffused, reappear very unexpectedly in far-distant seas. Thus Philippi and

Hanley quote shells common to the Mediterranean and Australia; Mr.

Cuming finds the British Lucina horealis and Nassa incrassata at the Philip-

pines                          u., J  -^ven  Mr. Hinds can trace no difference between  a Necera of  the
                            ;

China Seas and the European N. costellata. As to the line of demarcation

between species and varieties, that must remain in many cases a matter of

individual opinion. Those who, with Prof. Adams, can speak of the different

species of Man (Conch. Contr. p. 87 ; a view more congenial to the "pe-

culiar institution" of the stripe-flagged United States than to the readers of

Prituhard's Physical History), may be expected to constitute species of

shells on characters which to others will appear of secondary importance

while those who have been in the habit of examining large multitudes of

specimens will take a larger view of the probable extent of specific variation.

These differences will be taken into account in comparing the works of one

naturalist with another.

22. Having thus shown the grounds of caution in using the materials by

which a knowledge of local faunae is to be derived, we proceed to examine,

one by one, the sources of information which have been discovered with

regard to the MoUusca of the two great divisions of the West N. American

fauna. The localities to which they principally refer may be arranged as

follows :

       which the extreme point is Cape Classet) by the Straits of San Juan de Fuaco,

AChemnitz, and the older conchologists generally.                                     very few handsome

species from the Panama province, such as Oliva porphyria, &c., had found

their way into European collections and books, perhaps tlirough the pearl

oyster trade ; or even, it may be, introduced indirectly through East Indian

commerce. But our first direct acquaintance with the shells of the Panama

* The shells of this place rank somewhat better with Lower than with Upper California,

with which it is locally and politically connected. It was the first settlement on the coast,

having been founded by the Jesuits in 17C9. There is another San Diego in the Gulf of

Tehuantepec.

another in the harbour of San Francisco. An island of the same name is in the Bay of

Panama.

   ff This is quoted by Prof. Adams as a corruption of Taboga. It is, however, marked in
the charts as a very small island, N.W. of San Jose and one-third of the distance between

that and Taboga. A river Chiriqui is also quoted as in the Bay of Panama. Perhaps it is

near the town of the same name in Veragua. There is another Chiriqui between Greytown

and Chagres.

  tJ There is a Bay of San Francisco in Lower California on the Pacific side, in lat. 30░, and
another near San Miguel within the Gulf. Also a Bar of the same name in the Gulf of Tehu-

antepec.

ДД Another Hood's Is. is in lat. 21░S., long. 135░ W. Which of these is the "Lord Hood's

Is." often quoted in Mr. Cuming's Coll., is not known. It is possible that some species be-

longing to the Galapagos fauna have been passed over, from their being assigned to the Poly-

nesian station.

province is due to the French botanist, Joseph Dombey. He arrived in

Peru in 1778, and brought home several shells, of which eight species are
described by Lamarck*. {C. B. Adams.

   24. The earliest authentic collections, however, made on the Pacific shores
of N. America were obtained by the celebrated Baron Humboldt and his
companion M. Bonpland. In 1803 they reached Peru, whence they sailed

to Acapulco. It is to be regretted that they did not themselves describe the

shells they brought. They were seen, indeed, by Lamarck, who described
eleven species from them; but the detailed account was entrusted to M. Va-

lenciennes, and was not published till 1833, the descriptions having been
written in Nov. 183 If. In vol. ii. of " Recueil d'Observations de Zoologie et
d'Anatomie Comparee, faites dans I'Ocean Atlantique, dans ITnterieur du

Nouveau Continent, et dans la Mer du Sud pendant les annees 1799-1803,

   * An important aid in the understanding of the Lamarckian species was given by M. De-
lessert, who published a magnificent volume of plates entitled " Recueil de Coquilles decrites
par Lamarck dans son Hist. Nat. des An. s. Vert, et non encore figurees. Paris, 1841." A
copy may be seen in the library of the Linn. Soc, and a list of species is given by Menke in

his ' Zeit. f. Mai.' June 1844, pp. 83-95.

being given in the approximate order of collection ; the order of publication being very

   This list, being the largest known from Acapulco, would have been ex-
tremely valuable, could it have been depended on for accuracy. But (1) the
presence of several well-known E. Indian and other foreign shells (supposed
by Prof. Adams to have been obtained from the inhabitants, the relics of

former trade with the Philippines) endangers the authenticity of others,

unless there be further confirmation. And (2) the description of the species,

although set forth with not a little display, is performed in so loose a man-
ner, that it is impossible to speak of them with confidence without an inspec-
tion of the types. It will be seen that the author adopts a course, too com-
mon among French naturalists, of changing the specific when he alters the
generic name, appending his own authority for the species ; and that when
two authors have used the same name for a shell, instead of preserving the
right and re-naming the wrong, he has given his own names to both .species.

   25. In the " Voyage autour du Monde sur la Coquille, pendant les annees

1822-,5, par L. I. Duperrey, Paris, 1826" (plates only), the following are the

only two species connected with this province :

" Moll. pi. 11. f. 1, 1', Natica glauca, Humb. Peru :" =: iV. patula. Sow.

   26. The earliest known collector on the North-west shores of America
was the justly celebrated Dr. Johann Friedr. Eschscholtz, Professor and

Director of the Zoological Museums in the University of Dorpat. He ac-

companied an expedition in the Russian ship Predpriaetie, commanded by
Capt. Kotzebue, during the years 1823-6, which, after sailing round Cape
Horn, and visiting the Bay of Conception in Chili, proceeded by the Sand-
wich Islands to Kamtschatka, reaching Petropaulovski June 22, 1824'.
Thence they proceeded along the north-west coast of America to Sitcha, and
in October and November to San Francisco and the Rio Sacramento, In
the following year they again sailed by the Sandwich Islands to Norfolk
Sound, Sitcha ; thence to Manilla ; and returned via St. Helena. During
this time Eschscholtz collected 2400 species belonging to all divisions of the

animal kingdom ; including 10 sp. of Cephalopoda, 172 Gasteropoda, 45
Lamellibranchiata, and 28 Tunicata*. The description of the new species
was commenced by Eschscholtz in the " Zoologischer Atlas, enthaltend Abbil-

dungen und Beschreibuugen neuer Thierarten, Berlin, May 1829 ;" but he
died of nervous fever. May 7, 1831, at the early age of 37 years. The work

was brought to a conclusion in the year 1833 (from the author's MSS.) by
Dr. Martin Heinrich Rathke, who appears to have succeeded him in the
chair at Dorpatf. The following is the brief list of the species bearing on

   * The plants collected during the expedition appear to have been described by Eschscholtz
immediately after his return, in the Memoires de I'Acad. de St. Petersbourg, vol. x. p. 281--

292 (1826), " Descriptiones plantarum novae Californise, adjectis florum exoticorum analysibus."

   f An analysis of the MoUusca in this work is given by Menke in the Zeit. f. Mai, May 1844,

pp. 70-76.

Earl of Tankerville, with Appendix containing descriptions of many new
species, by G. B. Sowerby, Loud. 1 825," is a very interesting document, both
as showing how few shells from the West N. American coast were then known,
and also how early some of the most remarkable, as Crepidula adunca,
Lucapina crenulata, and others, had found their way to this country. The

following shells belong to our present subject of inquiry; those having page-

references being properly described in the appendix.

      lieve it to be an extremely

regret that Mr. Reeve, in describing the Limpets of the West N. American coast, did not avail
himself of the previous labours of Kscbscholtz, MiddendorfFand Menke in the same diiection.
If an author professes that he cannot understand the labours of his predecessors, he is not
bound to add to them; but if he builds on their foundation, without making that foundation
his own, he cannot expect the stability of his edifice.

    * Philippi regards /I. radiata-\-ancylus as forming quite a distinct species from A. persona.

He thinks that the locality-tickets have become misplaced, and that it is really from Chili.
He affiliates, from type, ^.punctata, D'Orb., which does not appear in the B.M. Cat., and
was not seen in his collection. There is no reason why the species should not reappear on
the Chili coast, as ^1. patina and S. mitra seem to do. Middendorff confirnis the northern

localities.

   "j* Judging from the figures and descriptions of this shell, I should have regarded it as the
                                                                                       ;

28. The next expedition furnishing results belonging to our present sub-

ject of inquiry was the " Voyage to the Pacific and Beiiring's Straits, per-

formed in H.M.S. Blossom, under the command of Capt. F. W. Beechey,

R.N., F.R.S. &c., in the years 1825-28." Capt. Beechey was principally

assisted^in the collection of MoUusca by Lieut. Belcher. Unfortunately it

was not at that time thought necessary to mark the locality of specimens

and for a large proportion we have to depend on general notes or the me-

mory of the collectors. Of several very interesting species, however, the

Alocality was carefully preserved.           series of specimens having been pre-

sented to the Zoological Society, the new species were described at the

request of the Society by Messrs. Broderip and Sowerby in the Zoological

Journal, vol. iv. 1829, pp. 359-379, with Latin diagnoses and a plate. As

this list is valuable, both from its not being mixed with other collections and

from the known accuracy of the writers, it is here presented entire.

   The duty of describing the MoUusca of the ' Blossom' was undertaken by
Mr. (now Dr.) J. E. Gray, who considered it a suitable occasion not only
for introducing descriptions of MoUusca collected in the Pacific Ocean about

--the same time by Capt. Lord Byron, Mr. Fryer, and the Rev. Hennah,

and presented by them to the British Museum ; but also for giving a com-

plete account (so far as materials then served) of the animals of the various
genera. This course delayed the completion of the work for nine years

and it was at last only by entrusting the revisal and completion of the MS.

to Mr. Sowerby, that Capt. Beechey was enabled to publish the work in
July, 1839. For the reasons above stated, the " Zoology of Captain Beechey 's

Voyage : Molluscous Animals and their Shells, by J. E. Gray, F.R.S. &c.,
London 1839," is more valuable as a contribution to general conchological

and malacological knowledge than to the furtherance of geographical studies.
     ON MOLLUSCA OF THE WEST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA. 177

The following is a list of the additional species described, so far as they may
be supposed to belong to the West N. American province ; the references to
the species already described by Brod. and Soiv. being appended to the
former list. The diagnoses are in English ; the plates beautiful and accu-

rate, sometimes, however, too highly coloured.

   t As Mr. Gray quoted the Zool. Atl. in the earlier part of this work, it is remarkable that

he did not adopt Eschscholtz's genus Acmcsa, instead of Lottia, which, with others in the
same work, appear only one step removed from the nonsense names of Adanson.

Seas during the years 1826-1829, of which the " Zoology" was published by

MM. Quoy and Gaimard, Paris, 1830-35, there does not appear to have

Abeen a single species collected identical with any from N. America.  list

of the MoUusca is given by Menke in the Zeit. f. Mai. for March 1844,
pp. 38-48. The same result appears in East Indian and Polynesian voyages

generally, which therefore have not been collated.

31. In the "Description of the Cirrhipeda, Conchifera, and Mollusca in

a Collection formed by the Officers of H.M.S. Adventure and Beagle, em-

ployed between the years 1826-1830 in surveying the southern coasts of

S. America, including the Straits of Magalhaens and the coa.st of Tierra del

Fuego, by Capt. Philip P. King, R.N., F.R.S., assisted by W. J. Broderip,

Esq., F.R.S.," given in the Zool. Journ. vol. v. 1832, pp. 332-349, occur

very unexpectedly descriptions of the following species :

   32. The most comprehensive and accurate materials for the knowledge of
the tropical Pacific fauna, are to be found in the collections made by Hugh
Cuming, Esq. In the year 1827 that gentleman set out on his first great
conchological voyage, and remained till 1830, exploring the West coast of

America, at various stations from Chili to the Gulf of Fonseca or Conchagua,

in lat. about 13░ N. He also visited various of the Pacific Islands, and

especially the Galapagos group. Mr. Cuming is the first collector on record
who took notes, as accurate as was thought necessary, of the results of his

dredgiugs. It is cause for the greatest regret that a systematic account of

this expedition has never been published. The new shells brought home
have indeed been to a great extent described in the Proc. Zool. Soc. and
figured in the Monographs of Sowerby and Reeve. Of these the particulars
of station and habitat have been recorded. But not only has the student to

                                                                     n2

wade through a number of works, at the risk of overlooking what belongs to
his purpose : he has also to find that many of the genera have never yet
been examined; and that, while new species are tabulated, the localities of
those before known are not given. If materials are yet accessible by which
lists could be published of all the shells found by Mr. Cuming at different

places, separately, with pai'ticulars as to their frequency, as well as station,

such a work would be among the most valuable contributions to geographic

zoology yet given to the world. All notes of habitat recorded in the Proc,

Zool. Soc. 1832-1836, may be considered as very authentic*. After the
interruption caused by the second and great expedition of Mr. Cuming to
the Philippines, there is of course a possibility of error from the accidental

interchange of tickets belonging to different species. It is right to state that

the services rendered to malacological science by the researches of Mr. Cuming
are only equalled by the urbanity and readiness with which he allows the use
of them to scientific inquirersf, and to which the author is under very

peculiar obligations.

    The following are the species observed in the Proc. Zool. Soc. Wherever
the localities or stations given in the illustrated Monographs differ from these,
the statements in the Proceedings must be regarded as of most authority.

    * It is necessary, however, to use even these with caution ; as, in the papers purporting to
describe shells collected by Mr. Cuming, species are introduced from places vfhich he never

visited. All shells quoted from the Gulf of California, Acapulco, and stations north of the Bay
of Fonseca, are of this class. These were obtained, but not collected, by Mr. Cuming, and are
therefore liable to the errors of his informants. A remarkable instance of the way in which
mistakes arise will be found in P. Z. S. 1833, p. 3fi, where Mr. Sowerby, in describing " shells
collected by Mr. Cuming," states that " detached valves were picked up on the sands at Real
Llejos and Mazatlan." In Mr. Reeve's Monograph, which is supposed to be of perfect accu-
racy in all matters relating to the Cumingian Museum, we read that " a few odd valves of
this species were found by Mr. Cuming on the sands at Real Llejos and Mazatlan."

   f Mr. Broderip, in commencing the description of the shells collected by Mr. Cuming in

--his great expedition to the Philippines, 1836-40, deservedly writes (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1840,

p. 84), "Mr. C, by his accurate notes, and the open publication of the places where every
one of the multitudinous species and varieties collected by him was found, has mainly assisted

in making a complete revolution in this department of the science, and has done more towards

giving us data for the geographical distribution of the testaceous Mollusca than any person
who has yet lived."

   X Perhaps the first notice of Mr. Cuming's labours occurs in a "Description of several new
species of Chitones found on the coast of Chili in 1825, with a few remarks on the method of
taking and preserving them, by John Frembley, R.N." (Zool. Journ. vol. iii. 1828, pp. 193-
205). Among others, the author describes Chiton Cumingsii, "after his friend Mr. Cumings
of Valparaiso, whose zeal in the pursuit of this interesting science will, he is persuaded, soon
make a large addition to our present stock." In connexion with this paper should be read
another, by the Rev. Lansdown Guilding, B.A., in the Zool. Journ. vol. v. pp. 25-35, "Ob-
servations on the Chitonidse : St, Vincent, May, 1829." In this paper, the germs Acanihopleura

is properly characterized.

nary students to make use of the information they afford. But in the part
of South America to vvhicli our present inquiries are directed, which is mainly
from Panama to the Bay of Guayaquil, it does not appear that M. D'Orbigny
himself traveled. The shells quoted from this coast were principally col-
lected by M. Fontaine, or copied from the descriptions of Mr. Cuming's
stores. Those which are connected with the West North American pro-
vince are as follow. The numbers refer to the " List of the Shells of South
America in the Collection of the British Museum. 1854'*." Some notes are
added on doubtful species, from a study of the specimens.

error has evidently crept into others.

describes the two following, of which one, probably both, are from the West
N. American coast. This accurate work, which does not seem to have been

fully understood by recent English authors, or allowed priority by writers in
his own country, contains a very interesting analysis of the geographical

distribution of the tribe.

--192 REPORT 1856,

   37. In the "Journal of Researches into the Geology and Natural History
of the various countries visited by H.M.S. Beagle, under the command of
Capt. Fitzroy, R.N., 1832-1836: by Ch. Darwin, M.A., F.R.S., London,
1839," chap. 19, pp. 4'53-478, is an extremely interesting account of the
zoology of the Galapagos (which were visited in Sept. 1835), particularly of
the reptiles; but no lists are given of the shells collected. The list of the
Galapagos MoUusca, drawn out by Mr. Darwin with the assistance of Mr.

Cuming, was unfortunately not preserved ; and the collections were distri-
buted without any catalogue having been made of them.

    38. Perhaps the earliest specimens of U. Californian shells seen in this
country were those sent from Oregon by Lady Katherine Douglas (now Lady
K. Wigram). It w"0uld appear that that lady procured shells wherever she

could, as some are well known to be from the Sandwich Islands, and many
belong to the Gulf Fauna. The collection therefore needs careful sifting

before it can be regarded as of any geographical authority. It contains,
however, several very interesting and new shells, which have not even yet
been found again by subsequent travelers. The following are the species

that have been observed.

   39. During the years \SM-5, Thomas Nuttall, Esq., for many years Pro-
fessor, of Natural History at Harvard University, Cambridge, U.S., visited
the then almost unsearched shores of California, by a journey across the
Rocky Mountains under the escort of a trading company. Although his
                                                  ;

object was principally botanical, his love of natural science induced him to
collect all the shells he could meet with ; and with such good success, that
many of his species have net to this day been again discovered. The pecu-
liar interest attaching to his researches is, that he did not visit any part of
the coast north of Oregon or south of San Diego. There is no danger,
therefore, of any admixture with the shells of the Gulf district; and his
collections may be regarded as the type of the Californian fauna strictly so
called. Leaving the American shores, Mr. Nuttall visited the Sandwich
Islands, whence be only brought one species belonging to the American

fauna, viz. Hipponyx Grayanus, on a Pinna. On his return to the United

States, via Cape Horn, the description of the marine shells was undertaken
by Mr. T. A. Conrad, and of the land and freshwater species by Mr. Lea.
The latter gentleman communicated his paper to the American Philosophi-
cal Society, where it will be found in the ' Transactions,' vol. vi. ; Mr. Conrad
read his paper before the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, in
Jan. and Feb. 1837. It is published in the second part of the ' .Journal ' of

the Society, vol. vii. pp. 227-268*. Although headed " Descriptions of New

Marine Shells, from Upper California, collected by Thomas Nuttall, Esq.,"
it also contains not only descriptions of several of Mr. Nuttall's Sandwich
Island shells and Hinnita JSuttalli, from Fayalf, but also shells from places
never visited by him, as Lyonsia injiata, Guayaquil, Dr. Burrough ; Viilsella
Nuttalli, from the Friendly Islands ; and Tellina lintea, a fossil from Mobile
Point, Alabama. The work bears the appearance of undue haste ; the genera
are grouped together without the least regard to arrangement ; a large pro-
portion of the species are named either Californicus or Nuttalli ; the diffi-
cult genera, such as Acmcea and Chiton, are not touched ; the localities
cannot always be depended on, as e. g. when Perna Californica is said to
inhabit the Sandwich Islands ; and the descriptions being in English would
not have been entitled to claim precedence were it not that they are accom-
panied by tolerably recognizable figures. The characteristic names and very
elegant and accurate descriptions of plants from the pen of Mr. Nuttall in
the same volume, make us greatly regret that he performed his conchological
work by proxy. But the confusion does not end here. Mr. Nuttall, having
reserved a small part of his collections for his own use, transferred the bulk,
of them to Dr. Jay, accompanied by MS. names for the shells passed over by
Conrad. These have been printed in Jay's Catalogue, but without descrip-
tions, with the addition of some not in the least remembered by Mr. Nuttall.
Under these names they were sent to Mr. Cuming and others, and have
taken their chance of admission into the monographs^. Meanwhile Mr.
Nuttall returned to England (where he now resides on his estate. Nut Grove,
Rainhill, near Liverpool), and continued to distribute the shells under MS.
names; but not having access to Conrad's work, the names of that author
were often lost, and others substituted in their place. So little is Conrad's
paper known, that M. Deshayes redescribed several of the most character-
istic species; Dr. Dunker complained that he had never been able to see it

* Part i, of the same volume bears date 1834.

иj- It is generally supposed that the Hinnites Poulsoni, which is described and figured by

Conrad in the same volume of the Journal, and is the H. giganteus, Gray, is assigned to Fayal.

The two species have been confounded, as the locality of//. Poulsoni was not known.

   J Of the species only existing in Dr. Jay's Catalogue, and which therefore have no claim
to priority, I am unable to give any information. I have requested that celebrated concholo-

gist (through Dr. Gould) to furnish the public vfith either figures or descriptions of them, but

have not yet received a reply. From the redescription of several of them by Dr. Gould, they
would appear not to be well known even by the naturalists of his own country.

  and Philippi states that it is not to be found even in the Royal libraries at
   Berlin or Gottingen. Having fortunately obtained access to a copy of the
  paper, and compared it with Mr. Nuttall's own shells*, and at the same time
   with those brought by the officers of the Mexican war, I offer the following
   as the best statement that present circumstances will permit. It should be
   premised that Mr. Conrad, in the 'Journal' for 1849, made several emenda-
  tions of his paper which have been here incorporated. The new species are
   described in the ' Proc. Zool. Soc' 1856, pp. 209-229.

* The T. alta is lost in this country. There is no figure in Conrad. In genera that are

loosely defined, there is a danger of species reappearing under two heads, as in the case of

Psammobia decora, Hds., which however was figured. The biangulate character assigned to

T, alta makes the IScrohicularia suspected.

t There is a Tellina Californica, as of Conr., in the Brit. Mus., which is probably identical

with one of these published species.

1855. The following are all that have been observed which enter the West
N. American province ; having been collected probably on the W. coast of
S. America, as far north as Guayaquil, whence the vessel sailed for the Sand-

wich Islands.

41. In the year 1836, the Venus sailed from France under the command

of M. du Petit Thouars, on a voyage of discovery round the world. The

second in command was M. Chiron, who, aided by his friend M. de La Perouse,

collected a large number of shells. The ship visited Callao, Payta, the Gala-

pagos, the Bay of Magdalena, Mazatlan, San Bias, and various stations north-

wards as far as Kamtschatka.

After the return of the expedition in 1839, M. Chiron furnished M. Des-

hayes with a large number of specimens, who makes this characteristic an-

MM.nouncement. "  les officiers de marine, qui ont le desir d'etre utiles k

I'histoire naturelle, reconnaitront qu'en mettant les riches materiaux qu'ils

rapportent entre les mains de naturalistes vraiment travailleurs, ils en font pro-

fiter de suite la science; ce qui n'a jamais lieu lorsqu'ils les donnent, sans

discernement et en totalite, a des etablissemens publics." In this country we

should desire to reverse the recommendation ; and consider that collectors

wei'e showing their discernment by giving the first choice of their materials,

en totalite, to public museums where they can be consulted by students.

In the " Revue Zoologique par la Societe Cuvierienne, Paris, Decembre

1839," pp. 356-361, appear Latin diagnoses of 30 " Nouvelles Especes de

MoUusques, provenant des cotes de la Californie, du Mexique, du Kamt-

schatka, et de la Nouvelle Zelande, decrites par M. Deshayes." As several

of the species figured by Conrad are redescribed, it is to be presumed that

he wrote in ignorance of his labours. The following are the shells belonging

to the West N. American faunas, with the habitats when recorded.

found himself at Singapore.

   The official description of the shells of the Venus, however, was intrusted
to M. Valenciennes, under whose auspices was published " Voyage autour du
Monde sur la Venus, pendant les annees 1836-39, par M. du Petit Thouars.
Paris, 1846." Of this work plates only have been seen, of which the following
are species connected with the West N. American coast.

    It will be observed that the author has, in several instances, not only over-
looked the writings of English naturalists, but even disregarded the descriptions
by Deshayes of the shells of this very expedition.

   42. During the period that Mr. Cuming was absent on his Philippine
expedition, explorations of great value were being made by a gentleman,
whose few published writings only show how much science has lost by his
early death. In the year 1836, the ' Sulphur,' under Lieut. Com. Kellett,
visited Callao and Payta in Peru, and explored the coast from the Bay of
Guayaquil to Panama. Here Commander (now Capt. Sir E.) Belcher took
the first place, a gentleman whose conchological labours during the voyage
of the ' Blossom' have already been recorded. Mr. Hinds, the surgeon of
the expedition, not only showed the greatest industry in dredging and other-
wise collecting specimens, but made the products of his labours tenfold more
valuable by the accurate notes which he took of their localities and stations,
guided by a comprehensive view of the subjects which it was his endeavour
to illustrate. The west coast of Central America and Mexico was searched
as far as San Bias, and afterwards explorations were made from Acapulco to
Cerro Azul. On the return of Messrs. Hinds and Cuming from their respect-
ive expeditions, they compared their collections and notes together. Here
were abundant materials for geographical and stational lists of the very
greatest value ; but, most unfortunately, the usual plan was followed of only
publishing the new species. This was done by Mr. Hinds in several most
accurate and valuable papers communicated to the Zool. Soc. and to the
Annals of Nat. Hist. ; and, in a collective form, in the " Zoology of the
Voyage of H.M.S. Sulphur, commanded by Capt. Sir E. Belcher, during the
years ISSG-IS^S; by Richard Brinslcy Hinds, Esq., Surgeon R.N. London,
Smith, Elder and Co., 1844. Vol. ii. Mollusca." The preface to this work

contains a masterly digest of the results of his experience on the distribution

of Mollusca, especially on those of the W. American coast as compared with

the Pacific Islands ; the influence of station, depth, temperature, and other

causes, both on genera and on particular spfecies ; and the comparative eflfect

was engaged in its circumnavigation of the globe. In 1839 it touched at
Callao, where 30 species of shells were collected ; but it did not visit any
other part of the Panama province. In 1841, however, the Vincennes and
Porpoise were early on the coast of Oregon. The Peacock and Flying Fish
arrived there in July ; but the Peacock was lost on the bar of the Columbia
River. The Expedition proceeded as far as San Francisco, and left in No-
vember of the same year. The conchologist to the Expedition was Mr. J. P.
Couthouy, who, assisted by his companions, collected about 2000 species of
shells (of which about 250 were considered new), and made drawings of the

   * Dr. Gould remarks (p. 270), tliat " there is a minute operculum to Mitra, while there is
none to Coliimbella." Of the shells called ColumbellcB, the typical species, C. strombiformis,
major, and fuscata, have a broad oval operculum, with the apex at the anterior end of the
outside margin ; Nitidella cribraria has a distinctly Purpuroid operculum ; and Anachis

costellata, &c. have a Pisanoid ungulate operculum. Vide B.M. Mai. Cat. in loco.

   In the MS. list of the shells collected in the Oregon and Californian
district during the U.S. Exploring Expedition, sent by Dr. Gould, and in-
cluding the above, there appear 70 species from Oregon, a district before so
little known, that only 23 of them have been identified with previous names,
the rest having been described by Dr. Gould.

   Through the great kindness of Dr. Gould, who showed his desire to make
the materials for this Report as complete as possible, by copying out all the
valuable information which was in his possession, we are enabled to present
the materials from which the foregoing lists were drawn up, in the shape in
which they first made their appearance. They are the only documents
approaching the authority of "dredging papers," which have been made
public, in the whole history of the coast, from Behring's Straits to Panama.
They are the memoranda made by Dr. Charles Pickering of the U.S. Expl.
Exp. ; the specific names having been for the most part added by Dr. Gould
on identification.

      44. All existing information with regard to the MoUusca of the Boreal
   districts of North America and the corresponding portion of North-Eastern

  --Asia, will be found embodied in the two following works : -" Beitrage zu

   einer Malacozoologia Rossica, von Dr. A. Th. von Middendorff. St. Peters-
   burg, 1847:" and " Reise in den Aussersten Norden und Osten Sibiriens,

    Zoologie. Theil I. Wirbellose Thiere. St. Petersburg, 1851. Mollusken,
   pp. 163-464." The author not only describes the results of his own travels,
   but arranges the discoveries of Eschscholtz (to whose specimens he had
   access), Mertens, Wosnessenski, and others. The descriptions are very
   minute and complex, the remarks extremely diffuse, and the references
   tabulated with consummate learning. Unfortunately, in his comparisons
   with the British Fauna, he had no better manual than Thorpe's Marine
   Conchology ; the invaluable work of Messrs. Forbes and Hanley not having
   been then completed. The first part of the ' Malacozoologia Rossica,' entitled
   " Beschreibung und Anatomie ganz neuer, oder fiir Russland neuer Chi-
   TONEN," containing 151 quarto pages, with 14 plates, consists of an account of

   21 species, of which 17 inhabit the Pacific shores. To an account of the prin-
   cipal form. Chiton Stelleri, 59 pages are devoted. All who study or describe

   species in this very interesting and difficult group, will do well to consult as

  much as their time allows of this comprehensive treatise. It is to be regretted

   that in the principles which have directed his classification, he has confined
   his attention to so limited a number of types; and, however burdensome to

   the memory may be the very numerous genera of modern writers, the sub-
   genera, sections, subsections and divisions found necessary to accommodate
  only twenty-one out of the many hundreds of known species, by no means
   lessen the inconvenience. Thus to descend from genus Chiton to species

   Pallasii, the Middendorffian student has to master the following phraseology
   " Chiton-Phsenochiton-Dichachiton-Symmetrogephyrus (B. Apori) Pallasii."

  The following are the Pacific species; the synonyms being those of Midden-

   dorff, unless enclosed in [ ].

   An analysis of the species belonging to the Pacific waters is given in pp. 349

et seq. The following are as yet only known from the Asiatic coast :

Chiton Pallasii and amicidatus.               Tritonium Schantaricum, simplex, Ocho-
Trochus Schantaricus.                             tense, ooides, cancellatum.

                                              Terebratula frontalis.

   The following have been found both on the east and west sides of the

Pacific :

Chiton Stelleri, Brandtii, lineatus.          Modiola cultellus.
Littorina Kurila.                             Cardium Nuttallii, Californiense.

HaUotis Kamtschatkana, aquatiUs.              Tellina nasuta.

   Of the species (so far as we yet know) peculiar to the American shores,
the following are recorded by Middendorff' as not having been found below

Sitcha ; the list, however, will have to be materially modified :

Chiton Sitchensis, lividus, Eschscholzii,     Trichotropis insignis.
    Merckii.                                  Purpura septentrionalis.

--224 REPORT 1856.

   The following list of species common to Sitcha and California will have

to be considerably extended :

Fissurella violacea, aspera.                                                              Tritoniura scabrum.
Patella scurra.                                                                           Petricola cylindracea.
                                                                                          Lutraria maxima.
Littorina modesta and aspera.
Trochus ater, moestus, Fokkesii, euryom-

    phalus.

   The following are regarded by Middeudorff as peculiar to the Californian

province :

Chiton Mertensii, scrobiculatus.                                                          Crepidula solida.
Patella aeruginosa.                                                                       Tellina Bodegensis.
Natica herculaea.

    The very abnormal appearance of the tropical Litorina aspera and Callo-
poma fluctuosum, in these Northern lists, awaits confirmation. The L. aspera
of Barclay may be founded on ballast specimens ; or it may be a misnomer for
the L.planaxis of Nutt., as ordinary coarse specimens of the two might easily
be mistaken. The Callopoma, which appears to extend along the Califor-
nian coast, may also have reached Sitcha through human instrumentality.
Another circumstance pointed out by MiddendorfF is remarkable : that two

of the largest species of Crepidulce known, are found on the northern shores

of America ; one on the Pacific, the other on the Atlantic side.

   45. In the years 1 S-iS-^G, H.M.S. Samarang sailed under the command of
Capt. Sir E. Belcher to the East Indies. Although the expedition did not
touch upon the western coast of America, there appear in the " Zoology :
MoUusca, by A. Adams and L. Reeve; London 1850," the two following

species :

" P. 70. pi. 9. f. 7 a, h. Calyptrma trigonalis. China Sea." This scarcely differs in
       any essential particular from Crucihulum lignarium, Bred., and its varieties from
      South America. The trigonal form may be an accident of growth.

"P. 78. pi. 21. f. 17- Artemifi Dunkeri,V\yi[. Eastern Seas." This is the abundant
       and characteristic species of the Mazatlan district, extending along the coast of
       Peru. The habitat is probably erroneous.

    In all other respects, as might be expected, the species described in this
beautiful and most instructive work are entirely distinct from those of the

W. American coast.

46. In the " Zeitschrift fiir Malakozoologie, von Dr. Karl Theodor Menke

und Dr. Louis Pfeiffer, Cassel, 1846," pp. 19-21, 51-55, Dr. R. A. Philippi

describes the following species from Mazatlan, on the authority of one of his
--own family :
                                                                                   '

   47. The Mexican War, carried on by the United States, 1846-1848,
against their sister republic*, ending in the extension of slavery, was
indirectly the means of adding to our knowledge of the Californian and
Mexican faunas. Three of the officers, viz. Col. E. Jewett (of Utica, N.Y.)
and Major William Rich (of Washington) of the army, and Lieut. T. P. Green
of the navy, made collections at different stations from Panama to San
Francisco, the whole of which have passed through the hands of Dr. Gould
for examination. The number of species collected by Col. Jewett was about

221 ; by Major Rich, 130; by Lieut. Green, about 172; in all, perhaps 440

species. Many of them were collected alive, and of a large part the localities
were noted at the time. It is too much to expect that gentlemen engaged

in so fearful and exciting a trade should be able to exercise the calm, patient

accuracy needed for scientific pursuits. On doubtful points, therefore, the
evidence may need confirmation : still it speaks much for the care and

interest for science which these gentlemen manifested, that the supposed

errors are few and comparatively unimportant. Several species thought to

be new Avere described by Dr. Gould in the ' Proc. Bost. Soc. Nat. Hist.'

Nov. 1851 ; and have been since reprinted, with additional descriptions and
three plates, under the title " Descriptions of Shells from the Gulf of Cali-
fornia and the Pacific Coasts of ?v]exico and California, by Augustus A.
Gould, M.D." There is no date, but the work was received last year in this
country. In order to promote harmony of nomenclature between the
writers in England and America, Dr. Gould ventured to entrust the whole of
his valuable collections from the west coast of N. America to the writer,

although unknown to him ; by whom they were carefully collated with the
specimens in the British Museum and the cabinets of Mr. Cuming and
Mr. Nnttall-j-. The result, so far as the new species are concerned, is em-

bodied in a paper laid before the Zoological Society last June ; and, so far

as relates to the identification of previous species, in the following lists. Of
many, however, the specimens had only been lent to Dr. Gould for examina-
tion, and have therefore not been seen in this country. When the identifica-
tions of species are erroneous, according to English interpretations, the name
assigned by Dr. Gould is retained as his own, with the supposed correct one
added ; in order that the meaning of the species as used by that author may
be understood in his other writings. The very interesting locality-notes of

Messrs. Jewett and Green contain several entirely unexpected statements,
Panama and Mazatlan species being quoted from Sta. Barbara, and vice versa.

Some few well-known W. Indian forms also appear from Acapulco and
Panama; which it is more natural to regard as importations than as "repre-
sentative species." The same may be said of the remarkable appearance of
Livona pica at Sta. Barbara. When we remember the errors that have

  At large part of the shells in the following lists, however, were not sent to this country;

having probably only passed through Dr. Gould's hands for examination.

crept into the works of the most experienced writers, it is not passing the
least reflection on the statements of these scientific officers, when we claim
liberty to suspend our judgment till the unexpected results have been
verified. The principal value of Major Rich's collection (as of those made
by Capt. Kellett and Lieut. Wood), appears to be the accumulation of rare
and interesting specimens : for geographical purposes, as most of the habitats
are simply divided between Upper and Lower California, it cannot be
regarded as of much authority.

    48. The first important contribution to the local fauna of the Gulf of
 California vi'as made by Dr. Menke ; who, having received from his friend
 M. Heinrich Melchers, of Bremen, a number of shells which he had himself
 collected at Mazatlan, proceeded to catalogue and describe them in the
 "Zeitschrift fur Malacozoologie," Dec. 1847, pp. 177-191. Here, for the
 first time in the history of West N. American MoUusca, we have an attempt
 to present a complete geographical list, of known as well as supposed new
 species, collected in a particular district. For the example thus set, and for
 the record of the labours of M. Melchers, Dr. Menke deserves well of

Iscience ; but it does not appear that his identification of species is always

[sound ; nor is it in every case easy to make out his descriptions of new
[forms. The paper is entitled " Verzeichniss einer Sendung von Conchylien

 fhe following species :

     Of the 45 species here quoted from other authors, the following 15 do

not belong to the fauna:-- Nos. S, 4, 9, 10, 15, 17, 23, 32, 37, 38, 45, 50,

52, 54, 58. It is fair to suppose, either that the writer has erred in his

diagnoses, or that shells have been imported. In most cases, as very similar

species really are found at Mazatlan, it is natural to adopt the former

alternative. In other cases, as in nos. 20 and 44, the species inhabit the

coast, but their presence at Mazatlan wants the confirmation of the Reigen

&collection. Of the shells intended by nos. 17, 28, 37, 46, 48,  59, no

information can be given. Of the entire 59 species, accepting the altered

nomenclature, which would reduce the number to 55, 40 are certainly, and

five probably, members of the fauna : of the remaining ten, it is unsafe to

hazard a conjecture.
   The above analysis has been attempted, partly in order to show the diffi-

culties attendant upon all inquiries of this kind. Here is a collection made
on a single spot by a competent gentleman*, and described by a concholo-
gist of acknowledged superiority, the editor of one of the very few strictly

Conchological Journals ; and yet only 32 can be accepted in the state in
which they are presented, the remaining 27 containing errors either of col-
lection or of description. If such is the work of a master, the readers of
this Report will accept with due caution the labours of a mere student.

   49. But if there is so much doubt attaching to Menke's first list, there is
still more in the principal list which follows. In the Zeit. f. Mai. 1850, no. 11,
Dr. Menke informs us that since his last paper, M. Melchers had again

visited Mazatlan, and had investigated the shells of that region with great

zeal and perseverance, and no little sacrifice of money. He returned to
Bremen in the summer of 1849, and generously presented Dr. Menke with

a selection in the autumn of 1850. So far all is extremely satisfactory; but
he goes on to state that he received at the same time, from the same ship,
a box obtained at Mazatlan by purchase. This fact invalidates the soundness
of all that follows ; except in those few instances in which we are informed
that M. Melchers collected the shells himself. The following list there-
fore must be received with great caution, except where the shells are con-
firmed by other authority. Occasionally Dr. Menke gives particulars as to
the number of individuals from which he describes; as when he tells us,
p. 1 88, that, as he has had an opportunity of examining no fewer than eight
specimens of Murex ambiguus, Rve., he can speak with authority as to its
being distinct from M. nigritus, Phil. If he had examined the many
hundreds in the Reigen collection, he would probably have come to a different
conclusion. The second (mixed) list is as follows :

  50. Among the many wasted opportunities of obtaining very valuable

information on geographical distribution, must unfortunately be recorded the
Surveying Voyages of the ' Herald ' and ' Pandora,' by Capt. Kellett, R.N,,
C.B., and Lieut. Wood, R.N. The former of these gentlemen commanded

the ' Starling' during the Sulphur Expedition. Their zeal for science is
shown not only by the large number of fine and valuable shells which they
brought back, but especially by the extreme liberality with whicii they have
presented them to public museums wherever they thought that they could

be made useful. "The shells were deposited in the Museum of Practical

Geology in Jermyn Street, London, then presided over by Prof, E, Forbes.

He writes that " they were chiefly collected on the coast of Southern Cali-

fornia, from San Diego to Magdalena, and the shores of Mazatlan." This is
precisely the very district of all others on which we are in want of accurate
information. San Diego belongs mainly to the Californian Province, Ma-
zatlan to that of Panama ; the question yet to be settled is, ? where and how
do they separate. Here was an exploration in competent hands on the very
terra incognita itself; and yet, alas! Prof. E. Forbes further states that
" unfortunately the precise locality of many of the individual specimens had
not been noted at the time ; and a quantity of Polynesian shells mingled
with them, have tended to render the value of the collection, as illustrative

of distribution, less exact than it might have been." Such information as
was accessible at the time was embodied by Prof, E. Forbes in two com-
munications to the Zoological Society, 1850; the first on the Land Shells,
collected during the Expedition, Proc. pp. 53-56 ; the second on the Marine
MoUusca, pp. 270-274-, The following abstract includes what may be sup-
posed to relate to our present subject of inquiry.

                        occur in abundance so far north in Oregon. It was probably

   The types of the described species, f;nd numerous most beautiful and
interesting specimens have been presented to the Britisii Museum. The
remainder may be seen by students in the drawers of the Mus. Pract. Geol.:
but the condition of the labels is not such that any dependence can be
placed on them unless confirmed from other sources. In the only list that
remains, it is said that there were the following shells from the Galapagos
18. Eight species of small shells; 19. Nerita ; 20-22. Purpura; 23-25.
Buccina; 26. Atcce; 27. Bulimus. Of the bulk of the collection, 95
species are known from other sources to occur at Mazatlan, and 35 species
have been taken in other parts of the province between Mazatlan and
Panama. Of tlie remainder, several are known to belong to Ecuador and
Peru, and some, as Pomaulax undosus and Acmcea Oregona, to the Cali-
fornian coast. But so large a number, even of those placed with the
Mazatlan shells, and perhaps obtained by commerce from tliat spot, ai'e
known to be inhabitants of the Pacific Islands and the East Indies, that a
list of them would be entirely useless for our present object.

   Among the specimens collected by Messrs. Kellett and Wood during their

voyage, which have been by them presented to the British Museum, have

been observed the following species :
ON MOLLUSCA OP THE WEST COAST OP NORTH AMERICA. 241

Cardium Nuttalli. California.      Fissurella ornata.
                                   Haliotis Cracherodii, Leach.

   51. But the largest collectioa ever brought to Europe from one locality
(with the single exception of Mr. Cuming's stores) was made at Mazatlan
during the years 1848-50 by a Belgian gentleman of the name of Frederick

Reigen. He did not live to enjoy the fruits of his almost unparalleled

labours ; and after his death in 1850, the collection was sent for sale, partly
to Messrs. F. de Lizardi and Co. at Liverpool, and partly to Havre. The
Liverpool portion measured about 14 tons of 40 cubic feet each. It was
bought by Mr. G. Hulse, wholesale naturalist in Dale Street; but before it
passed into his hands, it received such an examination as time allowed from
Mr. F. Archer, in whose collection, and in that of the Royal Institution, the
first unmixed fruits will be found. Unfortunately the geographical value of
these selections is greatly injured by trusting to memory and loose tickets ; and
the localities of the Institution specimens have simply been added from the
monographs, as ' Galapagos,' ' Panama,' ' St. Elena,' &c. Mr. Hulse fortunately
deposited the bulk of the collection under lock and key in a chamber by
itself ; but to save room, he immediately disposed of most of the large shells,
such as Spondylus calcifer. Patella Mexicatia, Strombus galea, and the
Pinncs, to a publican near Manchester, where they may be seen in his

" Museum." Circumstances enabled me to make a searching examination

of Mr. Hulse's stores, and to form a geographical collection from their con-
tents*. Finding that in a small manufacturing town this could not be made
available for the purposes of science, I acceded to the request of Dr. Gray that

it should be deposited in the British Museum; it being stipulated (1) that I

should be allowed to arrange it in its permanent abode, where it should re-

main intact as a separate collection ; and (2) that a descriptive catalogue
should be published of its contents. The duty of preparing this was en-

trusted to me by Dr. Gray. The work is already written, and most of it
printed. When completed, it will be found to contain descriptions of 222
new species; in addition to several which had been previously described
from the same collection in the ' Proc. Zool. Soc' and other woi'ks. Numerous

details are added on species already known, especially on the variations of
growth, geographical range, frequency, and synonymy.

   Being desirous of making the permanent collection of the British Museum

as complete as possible, and finding that the original stores were in danger

of being dispersed, and so rendered useless for science, I obtained possession
of the remainder of the vast collection, and subjected it to a renewed and
more rigid scrutiny. There will, therefore, be preserved in the B.M. drawers,
not only the type specimens of the described species ; but what will perhaps

be of more service to inland students, because less often accessible, large series

illustrating particular species, and displaying both their normal and their abnor-

mal variations. Thus, of Donax punctatostriaius will be found 192; of D.

+Conradi [_+culter, Hani. contusus, Ji\e. -\- Californicus, Desh.], '2,92; of

Anomalocardia suhrugosa, 130; of Venus gnidia, 59 ; of Anoniia lampe, 97 ;
oi Neritina picta, 607 ; and of Acmcea mesoleuca, 301 specimens ; every one
of which exhibits an appreciable difference from its neighbours. The latter

* Of this collection, amounting then to 440 species, an account was laid before the British

Association at Liverpool : v. Reports, 1854, p. 107. The list was examineil by Prof. Forbes,
and much assistance obtained from his experience. That assistance was promised during the

course of the present inquiry, and would have prevented many of the errors attendant on it;

but within a week after he had written to recommend the transfer of the collection to the

British Museum, he had passed to the scenes where human aid is no longer needed, and where
human errors find no place.

series was obtained by repeated processes of elimination, from the examina-

tion of about 11,000 specimens. The whole number of shells passed under

review probably exceeded 100,000. The following was found to be the most

--satisfactory plan for the determination of specific limits: (1) to spread out

the entire mass in somewhat of order before the view, in order that the gene-

ral idea of                                       the species (so to speak) might be  received  by the mind                                               (2) to
                                                                                                                                                       ;

examine the specimens one by one, in comparison with an ordinary shell

selected as a standard, putting to one side all that for any cause attracted

attention                                         (;^) from the hundreds  thus selected out of the thousands, or the
                                               ;

scores out of the hundreds, to arrange series according to observed differences;

(4) to subject these to a rigid scrutiny with each other and with neighbour-

ing species                                         (5) to  make a  selection  that should exhibit not extremes only,
                                                 ;

but intermediate grades ; and (6) to write the description while the result

of the previous processes was fresh in the recollection. No observations,

indeed, can compare for accuracy with those made on living animals in their

native haunts ; but the next best process is the examination of large num-
bers of specimens, such as the almost exhaustive diligence of M. Reigen has

placed at our disposal. The process may require considerable time and no

small amount of patience; but results thus obtained are far more satisfactory

than the plan too often followed, of picking out a few specimens of leading

forms, which alone are available to naturalists for description. So marvelous

indeed are the variations of growth thus traced to the same specific source,

that we may well accept with doubt species that are constituted from very

limited materials. This caution is by no means to be overlooked in using

the very catalogue in question ; as the only materials for a knowledge of the

small species (which amount to no fewer than 314 out of 691) were the dirt

obtained from the washings of the shells, which had most fortunately been

sent "in the rough ;" and the fragments obtained in ransacking the backs

of a few Spondyli, which were most obligingly placed at my disposal by

R. D. Darbishire, Esq., of Manchester, who had succeeded in rescuing them

from the publican's " museum."*

It would of course have been far more satisfactory, for the purposes of

science, had the collection never passed through a dealer's hands. The

fortunate circumstance, hoM'ever, of its size and value requiring a room to

be emptied and kept looked for its custody, has prevented the chances of

error which would otherwise have crept in. No species are inserted in the

catalogue but what were obtained from the boxes in this room, and from the

large shells about the parasites of which there can be no mistake ; except

Ficula decussata, of which Mr. Hanley distinctly remembers the appearance

of a very few specimens in the Havre collection. This, which, though com-

paratively small, filled twenty-eight boxes, after lying some time in France

without a purchaser, was in the main sent to London, and disposed of in lots

at the auctions, mixed with other shells, and without any knowledge being

communicated as to their history. They have been freely distributed as

--though from Panama ; and several of them appear in the British Museum,
labelled " Australia, presented by                                             Metcalf, Esq." Several freshwater

shells, Cyrencp. and AmpidlaricB, are believed to have come from this source;

but there was no trace of them in the Liverpool collection. In general, the

two sets so far agreed as to make it probable that the species were divided.

Messrs. Lizardi received a list, in which the exact localities of all the shells

inquiry, which would have been conducted far better under his auspices, had not professional

engagements entirely prevented his devoting the time necessary for such a purpose.

were recorded ; this invaluable document, however, was thrown to one side

as useless, and has not since been found.
   The best evidence of the authenticity of the collection is in the shells them-

selves. These were, with verj' few exceptions, taken alive, and treated with
evident care. Every single bivalve was separately wrapped up and ticketed
the mouths of the univalves were papered to preserve the opercula ; and in
many of the smaller species the animal was not extracted. The absence,
from so vast a collection, of attractive shells known to be found in neigh-
bouring places, such as Oliva porphyria, Terebra variegata, Malea ringens,
Cassis coarctata, Peetens and Pectunculi, generally seen in collections from
" that coast," shows that M. Reigen made little use even of the facilities of the
coasting trade to extend his stores. Nor are there to be seen the Pacific
Strombs, Cowries, Terebra?, &c., some of which even Menke allows to appear
in his catalogue. In one respect a town of limited trade is more favourably
situated for scientific purposes than a port of extensive commerce. Singa-
pore, the Sandwich Is., Acapulco, &c., to say nothing of places on our own
coast, are well known to be " hotbeds of spurious species." But among the
many myriads in the Liverpool collection, not a dozen individual shells were
found which can fairly be set down as strangers. The principal of these are

Arcafusca (living), which is quoted from the West Indies, and may hnger in the
   Gulf Seas ; or it may have come from the East Indies on a ship bottom.

Conus arenatus. One very rubbed specimen ; probably fi'om ballast.
Crepidula Peruviana. Two worn specimens ; probably fe'om ballast.
Fissurella Barbaclensis. One young fresh sp. ; probably brought over on a pebble.

   With regard to Lucina tigerrina and Mactra fragilis, of each of which one
fresh specimen was sent papered and ticketed with nearly related shells, we
have no right to deny their authenticity merely because they oppose our
theories ; as unexpected facts are continually making their appearance, to
the confusion of the mere systematizer and the corresponding delight of

searchers after truth. All shells of this class are included in the list, in order

that persons may see the bad as well as the good, and judge of its authority
accordingly. No attempt has been made (except with the small shells) to
state the number of specimens, because of the abstractions which had pre-
viously been made by purchasers ; but the following notes will give a tole-

rably correct idea of their comparative frequency, after these abstractions
had been deducted.

for the College Museum, and obtaining exact information on points connected

with habitat and station. Although he only remained thirty-eight days on
the spot, he collected

--266 REPORT 1856.

   Prof. Adams had before collected about the same number of marine species
at Jamaica ; and, holding the theory that no species could be common to the

two oceans, he was well qualified to detect any sources of error which might
have militated against his own hypothesis. The very minute discrimination
also to which he had accustomed himself in his researches among the land
shells of Jamaica, would at once prevent him from confounding similar

species. And as he visited no other spot than the shores of Panama, and

the neighbouring island of Taboga, there is no danger of the admixture of
specimens from different localities. The results of the expedition were " read

before the Lyceum of Natural History, May 10th, 1852," and published in

their Annals, vol. v. They also appear under a separate form as a " Cata-
logue of Shells collected at Panama, with Notes on their Synonymy, Station,
and Geographical Distribution, by C. B. Adams, Professor of Zoology, &c.

New York, 1852, pp. 334, Svo." The author gives all his references from

personal research : quotes every assigned habitat, with authorities (discri-

minating original testimony by the mark !) ; and, in addition to his own
remarks, states the number of specimens from which he writes. He was not
able to dredge, nor to make observations on the animals: but for the shore

shells, including the minute species, there is scarcely anything left to be

desired. The author describes 157 as new species: of the value of many of
these there will be two opinions. Prof. Adams in his work on Jamaica shells,
"Contributions to Conchology,"' pp. 84 et seq., gives up the common opinion
that species are natural groups, while genera, &c. are artificial : and as he

believes that there are different species as well as varieties of mankind, it is
natural that he should distinguish as species of shells what others might con-

sider varieties, and as varieties what may be accidents of growth. To the

discerning reader, however, this does not interfere with the extreme value of
the work. In a branch of inquiry so overburdened with carelessly observed
or recorded facts, the freedom from the usual sources of error is a matter of
the first importance. Where a species has originated in a mere theory, as

in the case of common types from the two oceans, the student is at once on
his guard. Where it arises from deficiency of materials, as in the C<eca,
additional knowledge will soon set the error right. And in the present state

of our ignorance, to designate forms as species which will hereafter have to

be united, is much more pardonable than to overlook differences, all of which
should be carefully noted before we can obtain a Natural history of any

single species*. There appear to be three stages in our progress towards

truth. In the first, objects are united, simply because their differences are

not appreciated : as when Dione hipinaria was considered a variety of Venus
dione, Linn., simply because they were each spiny. In the second, minute
differences are appreciated, while their harmonies are overlooked. Such is

the present ordinary condition of conchological science, as represented in

the Achatinellce, Cylindrellce, Anomiada, &c. In the third, species are re-
united, with a full perception of the differences among them, from a greater
knowledge of the range of variation of which living creatures are susceptible.
This third stage, when faithfully performed on sufficient evidence, should not
be spoken of as " confounding species," and is one of the greatest pieces of

   * In the " Researches on the Foraininifera," Trans. Roy. Soc. 1855, p. 228, Dr. W. B. Car-
penter stateSj that "multitudes of species" will be shown in the present Report to "have been
instituted in various genera of Califoniian sliells by the late Mr. C. B. Adams, whose identity
is established by a more extended comparison of individuals." This sentence appears simply
to embody the impression left by conversation, and not to do justice to the Professor. As I
am answerable for the impression I made, I have to request that those who possess the

--Transactions will make the following corrections : For " multitudes of species" read " several

species," and for " Californian shells " read " shells of Jamaica and Panama."

service that can be rendered to science : when carelessly wrought, as when

an author herds together the species of his neighbour, simply because he has
not been able to examine them himself, it truly makes " confusion worse con-
founded." For the first great requirement in a scientific writer, patient and

laborious accuracy, this, the last work of Prof. Adams (for he died in 1853)
stands in the very foremost rank. The following is an analysis of its con-

tents, for comparison with the fauna of the Gulf of California. It will be

observed that the species are arranged in alphabetical order, which may
sometimes prevent their affinities from being noted. The new species are

described in Latin, with measurements, and with an accuracy which often
makes it safer to identify shells from them alone, than from the showy plates
and loose diagnoses of some works of the greatest pretensions.

        If this list of species be estimated according to the standard of judgment
     followed in the Mazatlan Catalogue, which is necessary for a fair comparison
     between the two, the following numbers will not be needed :

         Univalves : 5, 33, 52, 70, 72, 164-, 174, 199, 211, 212, 216, 218, 241, 330,

            334, 337, 343, 348, 349, 362,= 20.
        Bivalves : 422, 432, 482, 483, 484,=5.
        The names given to 459 and 471 are also not required.
        Others may be discovered on a comparison of specimens or figures (which
     it is to be hoped the Trustees of Amherst College, who possess the types,
     will cause shortly to be published), though they are not recognized from the
     descriptions alone. The discovery of a large number of deep-water species
     was due to the hermit crabs. Certain observed differences of station between
     Messrs. Cuming and Adams are very interesting ; in a few there may be
     error ; from others we learn what great latitude is allowed to some of the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 !;

species: e.g. Corbula bicarinata is quoted alive from low water to 17 fm.
while Anomia lampe, quoted from low-water mark, was found by Major
Rich as far north as Monterey in 60 fm. water

   Of the 157 species described as new, 5 had already appeared under other
names, and 15 are believed to be only varieties. Fifteen are named from

their doubtful characters or similarity to other forms ; 8 are designated from
their habitat or station ; 23 receive names expressive of their small size
5 are designated according to the number of specimens found; and 6 would
probably not have been constituted, had the same shells appeared in the
Caribbaeau waters.

   The following is a comparison of the above collection with that of M.

Reigen from Mazatlan, excluding from the latter the land and freshwater
shells and the Bryozoa; and bringing down the number of species in Prof.
Adams's Catalogue to the standard adopted in the latter.

   This collection, containing 99 species, of which only one is certainly and

another perhaps imported, shows what a common sailor may do, simply by
keeping his shells from being mixed. One species is new; 46 are common
to both Mazatlan and Panama ; 29 are found at Panama, but not at Mazatlan

6, though not yet quoted from Panama, are southern types; 14 are found at
Mazatlan, and not at Panama ; 6 are northern types, being found in Lower
California, and of these, two (viz. Acmcea grandis and Pomaulax undosus

[operc.]) were not found at Mazatlan,

    57. In the Proceedings of the Boston Soc. Nat. Hist, for Feb. 1855, Dr.

   It is probable that some of the above shells, as Ranella muriciformis, Oliva

by the accidents of commerce. None of them were seen by Mr. Nuttall, who
spent some time at the place.

   58. The latest conchological traveller who has visited the West N. American
province is Mr. T. Bridgesf ; who, in the spring of the present year, has
brought a collection from the Bay of Panama. Although he had no dredge,
and the district had been well explored, he succeeded in finding 24 new
species, besides others new to the fauna of the place. The new species are
described in the ' Proc. Zool. Soc' June 10th, 1856, pp. 159-166 ; and, with

a few others, interesting for their locality, are as follow :

   59. Having now presented the results of all known expeditions on the coast,
we have further to bring together species collected from stray quarters. The
following are described in the ' Proc. Zool. Soc' 1832-56. Most of the Gulf
shells were collected by Lieut. Shipley, and of those from California by
Mr. Hartweg.

          * Specimens of this species (along with the proof-sheet of Siphonariadae) were sent, at

       Mr Cuming's request, for the use of the author of the Conch. Ic, but no notice of it has been

       found in the Monograph. As Mr. Nuttall found no Siphonaria in California, it is presumed
       that Mr. Reeve's species, if of Nuttall, is from the Sandwich Islands ; if " Californian," that it
       is the Mazatlan S. Lecanium, Phil.

   63. The Monographs of Kiener, in his " Coquilles Vivantes," are generally
executed with great care, and are extremely valuable for the identification of
species. The writer does not fall into the common error of minute division of
species : on the other hand, he sometimes unites what will be almost universally
considered as distinct. His judgment is not always correct on small shells, as
when he thinks that Cerithium trilineafum of Phil, ought without doubt to
be considered as a dextral variety of C. perversum. For the identification
of the Lamarckian species, his work is extremely valuable. But on points
connected with geographical distribution, the following list will show that,
unconfirmed, it cannot be regarded as an authority. The " California" of

French authors, as of English, generally applies to the W. Mexican fauna.

Unfortunately, there are no dates, by which questions of the priority of
nomenclature may be decided.

   69. Having now^ presented an abstract of all the original sources of in-
formation (so far as known to the writer), we proceed to embody them in a
table, arranged at the same time geographically f and zoologically, so as to
exhibit in one view as much of tlie foregoing materials as may be looked
upon as tolerably satisfactorily made-out. Doubtful species, or those whose

locality rests on insufficient evidence, are not included. Where the evidence

is good, but suspected, the name, if inserted, is in [ ] ; where it is poor, but
a priori correct, it is enclosed in ( ). Species entirely omitted can be written
in by the student, from the foregoing lists, if he is satisfied with the evidence.
All names printed in the same horizontal line are regarded as probably

conspecific; synonyms being distinguished by a single (.

   * Of this work, " Systematic Arrangement of Mollusca " (with figures of the teeth of
Gasteropoda), now passing through the press, Dr. Gray obligingly allowed me the use of the
proof-sheets. The main grouping of the Gasteropoda has been followed to a considerable extent,

   70. Now let the student of geographical distribution of MoUusca begin by

observing the fauna of our own seas, and learn, from the invaluable work of
Forbes and Hanley, to discriminate species and eliminate those that are
spurious. Let him then, taking Philippi and M'Andrew as his guides, compare
them with the shells of the Atlantic and Mediterranean shores. Let him, with
Gould and DeKay, note both the similar and dissimilar forms on the shores of
the United States. Let him, after studying the very characteristic fauna of the

Caribbean Sea, again cross the Atlantic, and observe the reappearance of well-
known forms, in spite of the vast extent of ocean. Let him trace the fauna
of Senegal with Adanson, of the Guinea coast with Dunker, and of the Cape
and Port Natal \yith Krauss. Here let him enter on the vast Indo-Pacific
province; and, having taken-in the general conception of the fauna from any
collection of East Indian shells, let him examine its special districts, from
Akaba, to Easter Island in the latitude of the Gulf of California. Let him

learn from Cuming the vast variety of generic and specific forms which cul-
minate in the Philippines. Let him trace some of these westward even to the
northern extremity of the Red Sea, where they associate with types from the
Mediterranean and even the West Indies; and eastward from group to group
of the coral or volcanic islands in the vast expanse of the Pacific. Let him
note the reappearance of forms at the Cape and Australia, in spite of the
broad waters of the Indian Ocean. Let him learn from Nuttall the species
which are common to the Red Sea and the Sandwich Islands ; and from

Stutchbury those which abound both in New Holland and Tahiti. And,
having at every step in his inquiry found somewhat in common with the last;

having, when examining the shells of the Marquesas in the center of the
Pacific, found several conspicuous and well-known forms of the Asiatic Seas,

in spite of (in parts) the profound depth of ocean that lies between ; he will
naturally expect, as he reaches the American shores, to find also not a little

in common with the opposite shores. He crosses the vast unbroken expanse

of the West Pacific ; one flank of the hemisphere of waters, which of itself

almost rivals the Atlantic in extent. He pauses at the solitary Archipelago

of the Galapagos, in the very longitude of the Gulf of Mexico, guarding (as
it were) the great bay of Central America, and within 600 miles of its shores.
Even here his eye rests with pleasure on a few well-known Cones and other
forms, which have crossed the fathomless depths and come to claim kindred

with their molluscan brotherhood of the New World. But here they stop.
They could traverse half a world of waters. The human spirit that gives

them understanding and a voice, beholds them on the very threshold of the
promised continent, in whose bays and harbours, protected by the chain of
everlasting mountains, they shall find the goal of their long pilgrimage. But
the Word of the unknown Power has gone forth ; and the last narrow channel

they attempt to cross in vain.

  We speak now of the first general impression, without regard to excep-

tional cases : and the ascertained facts fully bear us out in saying that there
does not exist on the surface of the earth a more separate, independent
assemblage of moUusks than is to be found, under three great typical divi-
sions, from Oregon to Chili. Mr. Nuttall, in passing from California to the
Sandwich Islands, found only a ^?jo/>ow?/a; in common. Messrs. Cuming and

Hinds, both of whom had well explored the seas of the E. and W. Pacific,
and of whom the former made his great collections in the two equatorial
boundaries, with no inconsiderable research among the intermediate groups,

having compared about 2000 species from the two districts, came to the
         MOLLUSCA OF THE WEST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA. 347

conclusion that only one shell is common to east and west, and not even that

to the intermediate islands*.

m 71. And if we are thus struck with the isolation of the W. American fauna
   general, so are we with the separation of its component parts.                                                                                                                                                                      Let us
compare (as being the most unmixed sources of information) the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       central

Scurria mitra, Osilinus ater and Omphalius mcestus reach from Sitcha to
Lower California, and Acmcea persona sparingly enters the Gulf; while the

ubiquitous Saxicava, one species probably under a variety of names and
forms, appears, like man and dog, to adapt itself to every variety of climate,
and to reappear in every well-searched fauna, boasting also of being one of
the most ancient types now living on the surface of our globe. The
Litorina aspera and Callopoma Jluctuatum, quoted on the authority of
Barclay, are so essentially tropical, that we may be allowed to suspend our
judgment before we receive them into the fauna.

  A75. comparison of the shells of the N. W. and S. W. shores of America

offers certain remarkable points of identity. The standard limpet of the
northern seas is Acmcea patina. On reaching the Gulf, it is replaced by
A. mesoleuca, which probably extends through the Panamic province. But
when we approach Chili, we again find the A. patina in D'Orbigny's collec-
tions, and it is figured by Mr. Reeve as though brought by Cuming. Indeed
if the Chilian and Californian specimens were mixed, it would be impossible
to separate them by the shells alone. It is true that Philippi, recognizing

some of Eschscholtz's Sitchian species as southern forms, accuses the latter of
mixing the labels ; but probably they occur in each fauna. The Scurria
mitra also, though somewhat more local, is a very abundant shell on both
coasts. The Acmcea cassis of Eschscholtz appears only a northern reproduc-
tion of the Patagonian Patella deaurata, Gmel. The Fissurrella violascens,
Esch., is assigned by him to the south, to which in type it belongs ; but it
has some claims on the northern fauna for admission. The Bullia ampullacea,
Midd., is essentially a southern type, especially abounding in peninsulas ; of
its specific relations we are not yet able to judge. The Natica caurina of
Gould, appears a geographical creation for the southern N. impervia of

Philippi ; while of the Oregonian Scalaria, Dr. Gould confesses theit he has

Been no marks by which it can be separated from S. australis, though he
expects that some will be eliminated hereafter.

   76. The Upper Californian district presents a very peculiar assemblage

of shells ; essentially of a temperate cast, but including a few forms of tropical

type. The leading species are as follow, including several which also make
their way into Oregon and Lower California :

The total number of mollusks known to inhabit this district, excluding most

--of those of which the habitat is only loosely stated as " California," &c., is as

follows: Bryozoa, 1 ; Palliobranchs,2; Lamellibranchs, 73; Ordinary Gaste-

ropoda, 100; Toxifera, 2; Proboscidifera, 24: Total, 202. Of these there have
only as yet been found common also to Lower California (San Diego to Cape

St. Lucas), Bryozoa, ; Palliobranchs, ; Lamellibranchs, 27 ; Ordinary

Gasteropoda, 23 ; Toxifera, 0; Proboscidifera, 6 : Total, 56; but as scarcely

140 species are as yet known from that region, it is next to certain that the
common species will be hereafter found much more numerous. Of the compara-

tively small assemblage known from Upper California, containing next to no

pelagic forms and only about half-a-dozen minute species, it will be observed

how large a proportion are bivalves, and how few proboscideans ; also how

much larger the proportion of the' widely extended species is in the former
Athan in the latter group.
                            very few, as Cultellus lucidus and Lyonsia

Californica, are perhaps identical with North Atlantic shells ; but in general

there is a wide disagreement. Here are found the largest species oi Parapholas

and Trigona; and the types of Platyodon, Cryptodon, Mytilimeria and
                                                                                                         ;

Saxidomus. The tendency of the Muricidce and PurpuridcB to assume the
acanthoid type, is well known, both in these and the West Southern shores.
The Lithophagus Gruneri rests on tolerably satisfactory evidence from New
Zealand as well as from Monterey. The wide-spread Strigilla carnaria,

even more like the usual Caribbean type than are the Mazatlan specimens,
here appears in tolerable abundance ; while even the Livona pica is stated to
have been found alive. Of course it may retain a lingering existence in the
upper seas, a.sLuci?ia tigerrina in the lower, while on the coast bordering on the

Caribbean it has died out ; but it is more natural at present to suppose it an
error. For the Litiopa divisa, an East Indian pelagic shell, said to have been
found on " Cape San Francisco," a locality of the same name occurs near the
Bay of Guayaquil. The sudden appearance of Haliotidm, of great size and
beauty, in the temperate shores of West N. America, is very remarkable.
Not a single specimen occurred in the vast Reigen collection, nor have any
been taken in Central America, or in South America, the head-quarters of

Chitonidae. On crossing the Pacific Ocean, however, we find that Japan,

which represents the same zone on the Asiatic coast, is equally rich in beau-
tiful forms. The following species are quoted from

              Japan.      California.

Haliotis Japonica, Rve.   Haliotis splendens, Rve.
       gigantea, Chemn.            corrugata, Gray.
         discus, Rve.              Cracherodiiy Leach.
         Siebaldii, Rve.            Californiensis. Swains.
         aquatilis, Rve.           rufescens. Swains.

Two of the Asiatic species, H. aquatilis, Rve., and H. Kamtschatkana, Jonas,

stretch upwards within the bounds of the Polar fauna in Behring's Sea
while the latter appears to have crossed the waters, and to have found its

way sparingly down the American coast.

77. Of the fauna of Lower California, meaning the peninsula from

San Diego to Cape St. Lucas, one of the most interesting portions in the

American coast, but the least thoroughly investigated, very little is known, and

that little but inaccurately. The shells of San Diego, as collected by Nuttall,

are almost entirely distinct from those of the Gulf. Most of them belong

to the Upper Californian type, but several fresh species make their appear-

ance, which are still distinct from the Mazatlan fauna. This ground was

well searched by Messrs. Kellett and Wood ; and it is probable, though the

evidence is very slight, that many of the peculiar shells of their expedition,

such as Hitmites giganteus, Pseudoliva Kellettii, &c., were obtained in this

district. The little that is known accurately of the peninsula, shows that the

stations on both shores of the Gulf belong essentially to the Panamic type;

those within  the Gulf being even more tropical than  those at the  mouth                                as
                                                                                                      ;

evidenced by Oliva porphyria, Cassis coarctata, Oniscia tuberculosa, Terebra

robusta, and other Panama species not found in the Reigen collection : while

the Bay of Magdalena and other stations in the Pacific are peopled, prin-

cipally by the Californian colony moving southwards, and stopped at the
Cape by the upward equatorial current ; partly by Gulf shells making their way

round the corner ; and partly, it seems, by a special little fauna of its own. It

will be an abundant recompense for the labour of this Report, if it should

lead any careful naturalist to make a diligent search of the district, both as to

its shore shells and its pelagic species; making accurate notes at the time
what species are taken alive and what dead ; in what circumstances and

quantities ; and with such precautions as shall effectually guard against all

Wechances of error.  shall then know, and not satisfactorily till then, where

and how the two great faunas of West N. America, both of which go loosely

by the name of " Californian," find their separation.

us with Palliobranchs, 1 ; Lamellibranchs, 60 ; ordinary Gasteropods, 49
Toxifera, 7; Proboscidifera, 20: total 137 species. As the localities are so

far from being satisfactorily established, an exact analysis of them will not

  A78. mere glance at the general Table, contrasting the species on each

side of the double central dividing line, especially leaving out of view the un-
certain column of Lower California, will satisfy the inquirer of the marked
and rapid separation between the tvvo faunas of California-proper and the

Gulf. The actual difference is, however, much greater than the apparent,
since the name of a species occurs in a column if only one specimen has beea
obtained, whether or not it were living there ; or if living, whether it were

an habitual resident or a straggler. For it will be observed that our present
lists are much in the condition of those of British shells, before the labours

of the dredging naturalists of our own day ; when a W. Indian shell was duly
                        .:

entered on the fauna, if it could be shown to have been picked up on British
sands. There are two main sources of information for the comparison of the

--faunas : (1.) The collections of Mr. Nuttall and M. Reigen ; and (2.)

those of the Mexican War naturalists. Now with every respect for the

labours of the latter gentlemen, who doubtless did the very best that it was
possible for them to do under their peculiar circumstances, we hesitate
before we receive from that source alone results at variance with the former.
And for this simple reason ; that Mr. Nuttall did not travel further south
than San Diego, nor did M. Reigen pass beyond the district of Mazatlan
while the officers were moving from place to place, and liable to the errors
that even peacable naturalists may make under such circumstances. As the
results of their collections have been carefully tabulated above, those who
place implicit reliance upon them can easily add to the lists accordingly : but
we think it a sufficient ground for hesitation, that no less an authority than
Dr. Gould had formed the opinion, judging from these collections alone, that

Mazatlan belonged to the Californian rather than the Panamic type ; the
contrary of which is abundantly proved by the Reigen collection. It appears
also that Prof. Adams entertained the same doubts, though he does not ex-
press them ; for while he quotes the war-naturalists for seven of his Panama
species as inhabiting Upper California, he says in his introduction that none
of the species of the province inhabit San Diego, which is at the borders of
Lower California. The following are the species common to Mr. Nuttall's
and M. Reigen's collections, the specimens quoted from the latter being all

that were found out of several myriads of shells..

of wide geographical extent; the few remaining being creatures of sedentaiy
habits, that are easily transported from place to place. Out of the 694

species therefore, sent from Mazatlan, to say nothing of the additional species

brought by Lieut. SJiipley and others, only 16 are in common with Mr.

Nuttall's Californians ; and even these, to a very limited extent.

as rich in the minuter fornas of life as are those that wash colder shores, or

even more so. Till the time of D'Orbigny, no one in the tropics seemed to

deign to bend his attention to what the amateur collector did not value ; but

Prof. Adams has already described many small species from Jamaica, and

80 from Panama, the latter simply by the examination of dead drift. In

these days of microscopic observation, most interesting results may be anti-

cipated if only dredgers will bring back labelled parcels of fine siftings from

deep waters; and ordinary collectors, sieved sand or mud from the shores.

If shells were packed in the sieved sand of the place ; if they were always

sent home in the rough ; if those who decorticate their backs with acid, thus

destroying the minute microscopic sculpture which is often the best guide for

the discrimination of species, would only first brush them without acid, and

send the bottoms of the wash bowl to some microscopical malacologist, taking

care to wash only the shells from one spot at a time, and not to mix the dirt

we should soon acquire a knowledge of moUuscan distribution which would

advance the science by rapid strides. Here do not apply many of the

sources of error common to larger shells. Ballast can scarcely mix its

anomalous transportations with the Cceca, VitrinellcB and Chemnitzice in the

interior of an oyster ; and the facts of distribution are as accurately seen in

these minuter forms as in the history of Cones and Olives. The remark

made by one of our very foremost naturalists, when it was first proposed to

investigate the Mazatlan shells, was that it was not likely that there should

be anything new among them ; as the large shells would be all the same as
Mr. Cuming's, and the small ones as those of Prof. Adams. And yet, com-

paring the 314 small species from Mazatlan with the 80 described from Pa-

nama, only '1% appear identical. The Cacum Jirmatutn, which is the abun-

dant Panama form, is extremely rare at Mazatlan, where it is replaced by the

beautiful and still more abundant C. undatum, of which only one minute

specimen was perhaps found at Panama. Of the principal Panamic Vitrinella,

only one individual was found at Mazatlan ; where it is replaced by the shell

first termed V. clathrata, which turns out to be the same of which an aberrant

variety was imperfectly named and described from Panama as V. parva.

And so in other instances, as in the larger shells ; ChemnitzicB being always
rare in individuals, fruitful in species, with many of a wide range ; Odostomics

not yet found at Panama ; Chrysallida communis, a coast shell, and very

abundant in both districts, while the other species from deeper water are

rare and local ; Bullidce and small Marginellce, diffused ; Rissoida, local

and so on in ways on which it would be pleasant but not safe yet to gene-

ralize. As the same large Spondylus which furnished the Mazatlan minutiae

is also found in Panama Bay, where it is dived-for by the natives to burn

for lime, with all its Parapholades, GastrochcencB, Lithophagi and other rich

treasures, travellers in that region would do service to science by bringing

home a few valves, that it may be found how far the small nestlers correspond,

as the boring bivalves are known to do.

But even with regard to the large shells, the distribution of many species

is anything but satisfactorily made- out. The fauna of the Central American

Aseas has never been properly published.  variety of new species are de-

scribed from Messrs. Cuming's and Hinds' collections, but of the old shells

found in the same stations we are left in ignorance. The practice of describing

only new species from voyages, instead of giving complete lists of those found,

very unnecessarily retards our geographical knowledge. The quotations

from Acapulco are like those from Dorsetshire or Guernsey in the old

British writers. What we yet know makes it far from improbable that while

one great type of shells extends at least from Guaymas to the Bay of Guaya-
                                                                       --

quil, each portion (the upper Gulf, the Gulf mouth, S. W. Mexico, Central

America proper, the liay of Panama, the N. W. shores of South America, and

the Galapagos,) has its peculiar species, or at least those which culminate

Ain that locality.  large number, especially those which are also common

to the Galapagos, are found on the whole length of coast, wherever there is

a suitable station ; while others, perhaps nearly related species, are very local.

Thus the beautiful Venus gnidia is found wherever there is a muddy bottom to

protect its delicate frills, (Hinds); while the V.amat/msia, so near that by Gray

and even Deshayes it is regarded as identical, has only yet been found in a

typical state at Mazatlan, straggling and of modified form below. The Dione

lupi?iaria is in extreme profusion at Mazatlan, and also found far down the

coast of South America ; but the D. brevispmosa, which resembles it with

blunted spines, has not yet come to light except from the Gulf. But we

must check these comparisons, so interesting to those who have made them

a matter of study ; and which, if developed, even according to our present

knowledge, would fill a volume. Nor would a history of even the Atlantic

waters, furnish materials for one more interesting and instructive.

   81. Oiie feet however is deserving of special notice. On comparing the
shells of the Gulf and South America, we obtain the following results :

Out of 143 Gulf Bivalves, 50 are found in South America, or 1 out of 2*86.

Out of 490 Gulf Univalves, only 89 have been found in South America, or

1 out of 5'5 ; while of the 151 Gulf Proboscideans, only 14 are yet known
from South America, or 1 out of 10'8. This may be accounted for partly by

the fact that the bivalves cast their spawn loose into the sea, while the uni-

valves, which have larger locomotive powers, generally affix their eggs to

shells and stones. {Gray.) Accordingly, the Lamellibranchiate fry are borne
on in the direction of the current, and ire found far beyond what may fairly

be considered the limits of the species. This further accounts for the absence
of some South American bivalves from Panama which are however found at

Mazatlaii ; the fry, with the current, not sweeping into the bay, but landing

on the Mexican coast. It is confirmed by finding the young of many South

Amei'ican species in the sand of Mazatlan, which are not known there ia

the adult state. Only two bivalves are quoted from Mazatlan and the Gala-

pagos (one of these, Modiola cajmx, a Gulf and Californian species, having

probably been added in error from Kellett's voyage) ; that group being out
of the current which we may suppose to convey species from Guayaquil to

the northern shores.

  How far the Gulf species,or those of Panama, extend on the South American

coast, we are not yet able to state with any confidence. Most of Mr. Cuming's

recorded South American species are from Ecuador and Columbia ; and
D'Orbigny's collections are too scanty, especially in pelagic species, for much

comparison. It seems probable that but few reach Callao, and extremely

Afew the coasts of Chili.  few indeed are quoted as far south as the Island

of Chiloe, but (except in the widely distributed forms, such as Calyptraeidse)

they need confirmation ; as do also the appearance of Crepidula nivea (Les-

sonii) and Lyonsia picta, both southern forms, at Vancouver's Island.

  A82. comparison with the shells of the Galapagos Islands offers points of

peculiar interest. They are known to us by the researches of Messrs, Cuming
and Darwin, the latter of whom has given a most graphic picture of their

peculiarities in his 'Journal of Researches,' pp. 145, 162. Collections have

also been made there by Messrs. KcUett and Wood ; but for reasons before

stated, less dependence should be placed on them. Unfortunately, though

                                                                                    ki

   previous results have been tabulated, the materials have not been made
  public. Mr. Cuming prepared a list of 90 sea shells for Mr. Darwin's use,
   but it has been mislaid ; nor can Mr. Darwin furnish any additional infor-

   mation, having unfortunately distributed his valuable collections before they

  were geographically tabulated. The following list has been constructed from
  one most kindly drawn out for this Report by Mr. Cuming, with as much

   completeness as his extremely limited time allowed ; with the addition of
  species tabulated in the Monographs, and a few from the Pandora Voyage.
  It is probable that some species have been overlooked from " Hood's Island,"
  which appears both in the Galapagos group and in the central Pacific : both
  of them are quoted in the Monographs as " Lord Hood's Island," and they
  are very rarely distinguished from each other.

quoted from the continent ; two [?] from the Gulf; one from Panama; the
other (a distinct variety), from deep water, from Isle Plata. On glancing
over the genera with their stations, it will be found that the coast shells
common to the two are more numerous than those from deep water ; and
that the general aspect of the collection is essentiall}' American *. The only
genus not yet found on the coast is Stylifer, which may indeed afterwards
receive species now placed in kindred genera, or be discovered on due search
of Echinoderms.

   83. Scarcely any generic forms are peculiar to the West Coast Fauna ; except
indeed Platyodon, Cryptodun and Mytilimeria, from California ; Leiosolenus,
from the Gulf; Callopoma and Teinostoma, from the Central Province, and
Concholepas from Peru. But many attain here their greatest development;
especially Calyptrceidce, Fissrirellidce, Acmcea, Uvanilla, Pomaulax, Caecum^
Chrysallida, Monoceros, Leucozonia, Cancellaria, ColmnbellidcB, Periploma,
Parapholas, Saxidomus, Trigonct, kc. The familiar genera of the East are
often entirely absent ; especially the shell-bearing Cephalopods, StomatelUdte
Dolium, Melo,Eburna,Ancillaria, Rostellaria, Pterosceras,Phorus, Placuna,
Malleus, Tridacuidce, Glaitconome, Meroe, Anatina. Aspergillum, &c. Others,
abundant in the Indo-Pacific province, are here barely represented by a few
species, or by minute or aberrant forms. Such are Marginella, Cithara,
Liotia, Rimula, Cypricardia, Clementia, Circe, Mesodesma, Crassatella,
Pythina and Scintilla ; and the tribes of CassidcB, Harpidce and Volvtidce.
The genera Conus, Oliva, Cypraa, Terebra, &c., the staple commodities of
the East, are here but poorly represented ; no large Cowry living on the
coast except Cyprcea exanthema, and not a single species having been j-et
found in South America below the Bay of Guayaquil. (Hinds.} The almost
entire absence of coral, so common in the West Indies and Polynesia, is to be
remembered in connexion with the paucity of those tribes that usually feed
on its banks.

   84. The point, however, which may prove most interesting to the geologist
and the geographical student, is whether there be any species common to the
Pacific and the Atlantic shores of tropical America ; and if so, what are they ?
It is easy for man to cross the narrow isthmus; have any IMollusks done the
same? The determination of this question is a matter of great difficulty;
for while ordinary naturalists treat shells as of the same species, if there he
no greater variation between them than is known to be allowable between
individuals under the same name, it is the present custom with geographical

conchologists to treat all similar shells as " analogues " or " representative
species," if they occur in unexpected places. In arranging the materials of
this Report, those species have been treated as absolutely identical,
where no difierence obtained between the shells of different seas greater

than was observed between individuals in one sea. Thus when the supposed
peculiarities of the Pacific Purpura pansa, Gld., and Trochus picoides, Gld.
are found in W^est Indian specimens, it is regarded as a mere deference to
theory to keep them distinct. In other cases, where the shells of the two
coasts have a marked difference of aspect, though not greater than may
obtain in the same species, if a separation has been made, it is temporarily
allowed, though it is more than probable that they will liereafter prove
identical. In other cases, the differences, though slight, appear ])ermanent
and specific ; and in a fourth group they are simply " interesting analogues,"
but would at once be pronounced distinct, although from the same shore.

Now even Prof. Adams allowed that one shell was common, viz. Crepi-

dula unguiformis*                                                                                      and  Dr. Gould  himself inserts        Venus circinata    and
                                                                                                    ;

argue, if one may be common, why not others also ? Because we cannot see

how they should find their way to other seas, is only an argument drawn

from our ignorance. Prof. Forbes, on glancing over the li^t of the Reigen

Collection, allowed that there might be species in common ; and in the

' Quarterly Journal ' of the Geological Society will be found a paper by

Mr. Henniker, in which the author gives geological reasons for the pro-

bability of the intercommunication. As the level of the Atlantic is higher

than the Pacific, any such communication must have poured the treasures of

the Atlantic into the Pacific, and scarcely allowed of an exchange in the

other direction. Such is found to be the case ; no species fairly belonging

to the exclusive Pacific fauna being found in the West Indies. Is it possible

that some such intercommunication may have been correlative with the

glacial conditions of the European seas ? Some of the supposed Caribbean

shells in the Pacific appear to have migrated northwards ; the Cyprcea ex-

anthema being poor and small at Panama, where it is called C. cervinetta,

but large, fine and tolerably abundant at Mazatlan ; the Strigilla carnaria

also, not even noticed as an analogue by Prof. Adams, appears blanched but

not uncommon at Mazatlan, and having crossed the " Cape Cod-j- " of the

western shores, assumes its normal condition on the Californian coast. The

ubiquitous Purpura patula, unknown at Panama, is extremely fine at the

Gulf. Other species, however, seem to be dying out ; as Lucina tigerrina

and Mactra fragilis.

It will be seen that more than half the marine shells are bivalves.

may take the form tingiiifonnis ; but there remains a distinct type, known by the form of

     ON MOLLUSCA OF THB WEST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA. 365

   It is probable that these lists will hereafter be greatly extended. The
shells will be moved from one head to another, according to opinion and
opportunities of judgment. Unfortunately, although the West Indian shells
were among the first examined, they are to this day very little better known
than by the Lamarckian conchologists. Most of the shells in collections are
dead and worn, and the dredge has been but little used, especially in the
great and doubtless prolific Gulf of Mexico*. At present our best sources

--of information are (1.) The Sagra collection from Cuba (mostly poor

shells), kept distinct in the British Museum. (2.) The St. Vincent collec-
tions of the late Rev. L. Guilding, scattered in the general collections of
the British Museum. (3.) The very fine Barbadoes collections of Dr.
Cutting in the Bristol Museum. (4'.) Prof. Adams' sea-shells from Ja-
maica, which have not yet been fully tabulated, though several are de-

scribed in the ' Contributions to Conchology.' Others also appear scattered

in the ' Zeitschrift fiir Malacozoologie,' and other works. The Pacific shells
having been so little known to the earlier writters, when there are analogous
species, it is fair to suppose that the West Indian forms are intended. This

is another reason for their careful study.

   85. But the analogies of the Mazatlan shells extend further than the
Caribbaean waters. Not merely some West Indian species, as Nitidella cri-
braria, found also in the Pacific, have made their way to the east shores of
the Atlantic ; but several Mazatlan forms, not yet quoted from the West
Indian islands, unexpectedly reappear on the Senegambian and Guinea coast,
as though they loved western shores.

   и If the " Central American difficulty " should ever draw our Transatlantic brethren,

Messrs. Rich, Jewett and Green, to the Caribbasan seas, it is hoped that they will explore
them well ; an occupation surely more worthy of a philosopher than killing his brothers ; and
a " difficulty " requiring solution quite as much as the ownership of the Mosquito territory.

   f" It is believed that Pctricola robusta was found in the African oysters; but this only
rests on circumstantial evidence: v. B.M. Mazatlan Cat. p. 19.

   X The solitary young specimen of this characteristic species in the Reigen collection, was
taken from the debris of a Spondylus, which is a sea (not shore) shell.

   Д Having very carefully compared large numbers of the West American shells {Pritcliardi,
Forbes) with a fine series from Gambia, sent by Chief Justice Rankin to the Bristol Museum,
I cannot but regard them as identical, both as to shell, operculum, and similarity of variations.
The shells called unifasciata may or may not belong to this species : several unquestionably do.

The comparative preponderance of bivalves in these lists is still apparent.

   86. The Kellia suborbicularis, Lasea rubra, Saxicava arctica, and Hydro-
hia tclv(s, of the Gulf, even belong to the British fauna. The DioneChionaa is
so like the D. Chione of our southern shores, that Mr. Sowerby at first united
them, quoting under Cytherea Chione, "Mr. Cuming's specimens are from
Mazatlan," while the dull S. Pacific specimens were described as C. squalida,
and the banded ones of the same species (by Dr. Gray) as C, biradiata.
The CcBcum glabrum of the British, and C. glabriforme of the Mazatlan seas
are almost indistinguishable. The same may be said of the form Leiostraca
distorta. The Cerithiopsis tubercularis and C. tuberculoides are most closely
allied ; as are also Byssoarca mutabilis and tetragona, B. solida and lactea,
Tellina donacina and donacilla, Modiola modioli/" and capax, Thracia
squamosa and villosiuscula, Acmcea mesoleuca and testudinalis, Galerus
mammillaris and Sinensis, lanthina striulata and communis, I. prolongata
and pallida, Jeffreysia bifasciata and opalina, and Nassa crebristriata
and reticulata. The Gouldia varians may compare with Astarte triangu-
laris and Tornatina infrequens with Cylichna mammillata. The reappear-
ance of the rare genera Montacuia, Lepton, and Barleia, is also worthy of

notice.

   87. Besides these analogies with the Atlantic shells, there are a few
singular exceptions to the general dissimilarity with the Asiatic and Indo-
Pacific faunas. Thus we have the Japanese Cythei-ea petichialis reappearing
at Mazatlan ; and Nassa acuta most closely resembling an Australian species
in Mr. Cuming's collection. The Oliva Duclosi is quoted from the Pacific
islands ; as are also the ubiquitous Natica maroccana and Nitidella cribraria,
the pelagic lanthina striulata, the sedentary Hipponices barbatus and
Grayanus ; and a few other species, concerning which there is a fair chance
of inaccuracy, especially in shells from " Lord Hood's Island."

   88. Of the land and freshwater shells little is yet known except those

brought from Oregon. These are of a different type from those of the

Atlantic states, and have more the general appearance of old world forms.
The few known from Mazatlan are essentially tropical in type, and differ from
those found on the east of the Rocky Mountains.

   89. The Bryozoa are included in this Report, because it appears univer-
sally acknowledged that they have more in common with the lower Tunicata
and the Molluscan type in general, than with the Radiata. What few are
known have been described by Mr. G. Busk, who regards one species as
identical with a British form, another with a specimen dredged by Mr.Darwin,
from 96 fms. in Chiloe, a third with a tertiary fossil from Vienna, and the
rest as new.

   90. Of the Pteropods nothing is known ; of the naked Gasteropods only a
few forms from Sitcha and Oregon ; of the Palliobranchiata scarcely any ;

and of the Cephalopods only two, not characterized, from the Behring Sea.

   91. It would be extremely interesting, after comparing the West Ameri-
can shells with other existing faunas, to carry our researches back in time,
and compare them with the fossils known to occur on the same coasts. For
such inquiries, however, thei'e exist scarcely any materials. All that we know
is a little concerning the fossils of Oregon in the tenth volume of the ' U. S.
Exploring Expedition,' Geology, by Jas. D. Dana. In Appendix I. p. 723,
the following fossil shells from the sandstone of Astoria are described.

which are found in both oceans ; and a Vermetus, among Mr. Nuttall's Clai-

been ascertained*. He has stated his opinions with some freedom; because

it was thought that an expression of the difficulties encountered in the prosecu-
tion of tlie subject and of their causes, miglit (1) put other students on their
guard, and (2) contribute somewhat towards their removal. Tliey will be re-
ceived simply as the judgments of a learner who came fresh to the subject,
without previous acquaintance with books and naturalists. Ilis object has
been, not himself to build, but to clear away some of the encumbrances, lay
part of the foundations, and collect a few of the materials, ready for the great
architects of science to erect the beautiful editice of harmonious knowledge.
The first scientific explorer of these regions, the venerable Baron Humboldt,
still lives to enjoy the earthly rest after his labours : but the early death of so
many whose names have been quoted, of Eschscholtz, of Hinds, of Souleyet,
of Reigen, of Adams, and of Forbes, urges us to "work while it is day"; that

we may prepare for that state where ignorance shall have passed away, and
where " we shall know even as also we are known."

Abstract of First Report on the Oyster Beds and Oysters of the British

                  Shores. By T. C. Eyton, F.L.S., F.G.S.

--For convenience sake I shall divide this Report into three sections : 1st,

A history of oysters and the laws relating to them. 2ndly, An account

of the different beds. 3rdly, The history of the oyster from its embryo
state in the parent shell until it is seven years old ; and, lastly, a summary

--of deductions from the reports I have received. The oyster fisheries of

England are of great antiquity, the luxurious Romans held the British
oyster in high estimation. There have at different times been many Acts of

Parliament passed for the protection of oyster-beds; the fisheries are at

present, however, regulated by a Convention entered into between Her
Majesty the Queen and the King of the French ; and an Act passed to carry
&the same into effect (6 7 Vict. c. 79), which enacts that the fisiieries shall
open on the 1st of September and close on the 30th of April.

   The oyster-beds which I have visited or received reports from are the

--following : Loch Ryan, the whole of the Welsh beds. Loch Fyne (a bed of

no commercial value). Isle of Man beds, Jersey, Guernsey and Sark beds,
Kentish and Essex beds. The oysters, from which the spawn I am about to

mention was taken, were obtained from Loch Ryan, at the entrance to the
Clyde, on the 10th of July, and were forwarded to me in a box packed in
wet grass; they were thirty-two in number, of which only three proved to
be in spawn : in these, from a rough calculation, which I believe to be much
under the mark, the number of young was about 3,000,000. The first oyster
I opened had the spawn exuded, so that it lay on one side between the folds
of the mantle. The mass was of a purplish colour ; and on examining it with
a hand-glass, I could perceive some motion ; but on placing some on a glass
plate under a :|:-inch power in the microscope, I could clearly perceive that
what I had taken with the naked eye for ova were living animals varying
slightly in shape. The animal was semi-transparent, with two reddish
elongated dots placed on each side behind the cilia, which were in constant

   * The Plates appended to tliis Report, at the recommendation of the Committee, are intended
to illustrate some of the principal variations observed in individuals of the same species,
especially when the forms have been described as different species, or represent the characters
of different (so called) subgenera. They are to be regarded as portraits, not photographs of
the Mazatlan shells in the British Museum Collection.

and rapid motion. They were exceedingly tenacious of life, the cilia moving
until the water was dryed upon the glass. Some that I placed in a little
salt and water were alive the next day. The oysters on the table have been,
through the kindness of Mr. Sweeting, fishmonger, Cheapside, sent to me,

and are from one to four years old.
   It now, therefore, only remains to trace the life of the oyster and the

changes it undergoes from the state I in which found it in the parent until it
has formed its shell and attached itself to some substance, which I hope to be
able to do next year in a continuation of this Report. From the reports I

have received and my own observations, I think that the fence months might
be advantageously altered on many beds, and that if such alteration was
made, the markets might be supplied the greater portion of the year. The

depth of water appears to be the chief cause of a difference in the time of
spawning ; and it is exceedingly doubtful if on some deep beds they spawn
at all; and they are probably supplied by the fry drifting from some neigh-

bouring bed in shallower water. The commonly received opinion among the
fishermen, that the oyster deposits its spawn in masses, is entirely erroneous.

Oysters are best for the table out of shallow water, and at the entrance of a
river if suitable ground is found, and feed quicker in such situations.

   The author then read a series of questions, which it was requested any
person connected with oyster-beds would be kind enough to answer and

--forward to him : 1. Name of fishery ? 2. Depth of water? 3. Computed

size of beds ? 4. At what age do oysters spawn ? and do all oysters above
that age spawn ? 5. Does the time of spawning differ on different beds
within your knowledge ? 6. If such difference exist, is it caused by a
variation in the depth of water, or any other reason ? 7. What is the

ground ? 8. Do the oysters differ on different sorts of ground ? 9. Add

any other information.

--Report on Cleavage and Foliation in Rocks, and on the Theoretical
   Explanations of these Ph(Bnomena. Parti. .By John Phillips,
   M.A., F.R.S., Reader in Geology in the University of Oxford.

Of the numerous structures existing in rocks, two more predominant than

--the rest have long been referred to their appropriate causes sedimentary

--deposition crystalline aggregation. The 'strata,' formed by the first pro-

cess, have all the varieties of mineral substance and magnitude of grain, and

all the inequality of extent and bulk which we observe to occur in modern

deposits from water ; the granite and other quartzo-felspathic rocks offer a

large range of crystalline aggregates, always analogous to, and sometimes

undistinguishable from, the products of actual volcanoes.

But in many, and especially in mountainous countries, examples occur of

rocks which seem both crystalline in texture and stratified in structure, and

others which are apparently formed by sediments, but are thoroughly fis-

sured to a degree of tenuity, and with a regularity and continuity not observed

in ordinary cases of stratification. The former case is exemplified in gneiss,

the latter in clay-slate. Giving to the divisions of gneiss the name of
' foliation,' and to the fissures of slate the title of ' cleavage,' we may proceed

to trace the observations and inferences by which some light has been thrown

find these laminae crossed by repeated fissures, nearly at right angles. The
' repeated fissures' are, however, often tlie traces of strata, and the nearly
vertical lamiu^, so common in these parts of the mountains, are sometimes
genuine cleavage*. In the gneissic axis of Mont Blanc the nearly vertical
divisions are ' foliation.' Even in our own day the true reading of the
structure of the Alps is a difficult problem, and laminas of cleavage are there

frequentlv described as layers of stratification.

   The following extracts from ' Travels in the Tarentaise in 1820,1821,1822,'
by Robert Bakewell, published in 1823, show that this ingenious author had

conceived views nearly approaching those of subsequent writers :

   " On the eastern side of the valley (Thones), about two miles from the

town of Thones, there is a rock which presents an appearance of double
stratification, not uncommon in the calcareous mountains of the Alps, and
which has frequently induced Saussure to suppose that the vertical strata
were placed in junction with other strata nearly horizontal; an error into
which he has been led by mistaking very distinct vertical cleavages for stra-

tification. On approaching that rock I had little doubt that the strata were
vertical, but when I came in front of it I perceived the true strata-seams

forming curves, which were intersected at one end by a vertical cleavage.
It sometimes happens that the strata-seams are entirely concealed in the
perpendicular escarpment of rock by a calcareous incrustation deposited
over the face of the rock, and in such instances the cleavages often project
and resemble strata so much that it requires great care to avoid error in
tracing the true line of dip in the stratification. This probable cause of

--error is of frequent occurrence in the Alps." Vol. i. p. 67-
  --In the valley of the Arve " The cleavages on a large scale are often as

regular as the strata themselves, and can be scarcely distinguished from

them ; and as these cleavages intersect the strata nearly at right angles, this
has also led to many erroneous conclusions respecting the stratification of

--the calcareous mountains of this part of Savoy." Vol. i. p. 337-
  --From the Appendix, vol. ii. p. 423 : " There are other situations where

the calcareous mountains of the Alps present to the hasty observer an ap-
pearance of the most irregular and contorted stratification imaginable, which
is merely an optical illusion produced by a variety of cleavages in the moun-
tain limestone ; some being at right angles to the line of dip, and others to
the line of bearing. There is likewise another cleavage in some of these

mountains which is curved, and is produced by a tendency to a globular

structure in the mass of the mountain. [A mountain in the valley of

 Lauterbrun, referred to as an illustration.] Near the end of the mountain
 the true strata-seams are seen, and are nearly horizontal, while farther up

 the valley several curved perpendicular cleavages present the appearance of

 thick beds of strata very much bent. In this instance the overlapping of

 the edges of the strata and the direction of the natural cleavages have nearly
 concealed the true form of the stratification. Such instances as this are of
 frequent occurrence in the Alps, and have been the source of many erroneous
 conclusions, for they have hitherto been but imperfectly understood. This
 tendency to a globular structure en masse I observed very frequently in the
 Bernese Oberland. It is altogether independent of stratification, though it

 has often been mistaken for it; but it has not hitherto been noticed, that I
 know of, by any geologist that has visited the Alps. The limestone in which
 I observed the curved cleavage most distinctly is dark coloured, hard and

brittle ; and it is intermixed with schist. This limestone seems to pass by

gradation into flinty slate."

   In his 'Introduction to Geology' (published 1813) the same author ex-

--presses a positive opinion. Speaking of slate, he observes, " This rock is

always represented as stratified ; but in this respect it resembles gneiss and
mica-slate, and the slaty and tabular structure

are, I conceive, the effect of crystallization,
depending on the nature of its constituent

parts."-- P. 86.

   The earliest notice of a real and firm di-
stinction between cleavage and stratification,

derived from English examples, which I have
met with, is in Otley's ' Concise Description
of the English Lakes*.' The modest and

intelligent author, speaking of the middle

division of the slaty rocks, notices their pre-
valent though obscure stratification dipping

to the south-east, speaks of the beds of slate

with frequently vertical cleavage, and adds,

и' but it is found in various digrees of inclina-

   Notwithstanding these and probably many other partial views which
recognized some diff'erence between cleavage and stratification, it was re-

served for Professor Sedgwick, in the year 1835Д, to define in a satisfactory
manner the essential character of slaty cleavage, and to show its exact place
in the series of changes by which soft argillaceous deposits have been stra-
tified and solidified, cleft and jointed. Instructed by the repeated examina-

rocks and in certain regions, by the operation of some very extensive cause

operating after the stratified rocks had undergone great displacement.
For this fundamental generalization we are, I bflieve, entirely indebted to

Sedgwick.

                                                         Strata.

Of this remarkable fact, and of its extensive bearing on the theory of

-- Acleavage. Professor Sedgwick's memoir gives the earliest notice, confirmed

by abundant examples in Wales : " rugged country, more than thirty

miles in length and eight or ten in breadth, stretching from the gorge of the

Wye above Rhaiadr to the upper gorges of the Elan and the Towy, exhibits

on a magnificentscale, thousands of examples of much contorted strata, crossed

by parallel cleavage planes. Of the true bedding in these cases there is not
a shadow of a doubt. Many parts are of a coarse mechanical texture ; but

subordinate to these are fine chloritic slate. But the coarser beds and the

finer, the twisted and the straight, have all been subjected to one change.

TtHiatever be the contortions of the rocks,

the planes of cleavage pass on, generally    Fig. 3.

wick, to show the parallelism of cleavage

     Д 4. Cleavage symmetrically related to axes of movement of (he Strata.

   In a great number of examples in Wales, Westmoreland and Yorkshire,
where the cleavage is perfect and tiie strata are distinct, it is found that the
edges of the laminae of cleavage show themselves very plainly in the surfaces
of stratification, and these edges are often nearly horizontal. To use the
expression of Sedgwick, who first declared the fact, " where the cleavage is
well developed in a thick mass of slate rock, the strike of the cleavage is
nearly coincident with the strike of the beds*." This is most frequently ob-
served where the strike of the strata is most persistent ; or in other words,
where the anticlinal and synclinal axes of movement are most simple, con-
tinuous, and uniform in direction.

    But where the axes of movement are complicated by small folds and
twists, the local coincidence of the strike of cleavage and the strike of stra-
tification frequently fails ; the cleavage maintains, or tends to maintain, one
uniform direction, and tiius crosses the folds of the strata under various
circumstances, more or less suggestive of an influence more general than
that which determined the folds.

    If the expression above quoted from Prof. Sedgwick be well considered,
and taken in connexion with the exceptions which he mentions, it will appear
that in his mind the direction of cleavage in a large district was coincident,

ployed in this sense by Sedgwick.

 or nearly so, with the main or mean direction of the strike of the beds, though
 it is not actually so stated in the paper. In 1843 I presented as the result
 of a special study of the geographical relation in question, among the

--slaty rocks of Wales, the following explicit expression, " The cleavage

 planes of the slate rocks of Wales are always parallel to the main direction
 of the great anticlinal axes, but are not affected by the small undulations
 and contortions of those lines*" which may be regarded as confirming the
 views of Sedgwick. Prof. Jukes finds the same result in Newfoundlandf

--Mr. Darwin has an analogous expression for South America : " The clea-

 vage laminae range over wide areas with remarkable uniformity, being parallel
 in strike to the main axes of elevation, and generally to the outlines of the

 coast |." And since 1837, Professors H. D. Rogers and W. B. Rogers have
 observed and recorded, in Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, " the close

 parallelism of the cleavage planes of a given district with each other, and

with the main axis of elevation of the district Д." And lastly, in 1849, Mr. D.
 Sharpe, in reviewing these statements, adds, as from his own conviction, that

 " the direction of the strike of the cleavage is parallel to the main direction
of the axes of elevation, and has no necessary connexion with the strike of
the beds||." This is somewhat enigmatical, for it is by the "strike of the
beds" that we determined the axes of elevation and depression : Mr. Sharpe
had perhaps misunderstood Professor Sedgwick's use of the word strike, and
probably meant to say that the cleavage observed at any one place was not
necessarily dependent on the strike of the beds at that place. Professor
Harkness has found remarkable agreements between the strike of cleavage
and the axes of movements in the S.W. of Ireland ^. According to these
authors, then, though cleavage is really or nearly independent at every
point of the previously fixed position of the strata there, crosses them with
little variation, whether they be curved or plane, and preserves or nearly
preserves its own dip or its own verticality, in whatever direction and in
whatever degree they are inclined ; cleavage and stratification have, never-
theless, one real geographical relation, an approximate parallelism of strike,

dependent on the axes of movement of the rocks. To this conclusion, how-
ever, there are many exceptions ; one of the most remarkable exceptions
known to mu is found in North Devon, where the general strike of the beds
is nearly east and west ; but the cleavage strike is nearly E.N.E. and W.S.W.,

by the observations of Sedgwick, Sharpe and myself.
   In Charnwood Forest I find the average strike of the strata, exactly

measured, to form an angle of 19░ 12' with the average strike of the cleavage.

         Д 5. Relation of Cleavage Planes to the Inclination of the Strata.

   Almost every observer in mountainous regions who has once perceived the
symmetrical relation of the strike of cleavage to the great axes of movement
of the masses, seeks for some corresponding symmetry between the dip of
the strata and the inclination of the cleavage. But unless the investigation

be carried across a whole district, so as to furnish comparisons on both

sides of all the anticlinals and synclinals, the result cannot be much relied
on. Mr. Darwin, who has in this respect the advantage of great range of
observation, having observed the persistence of the strike of cleavage, and

the frequent change of their dip both in angular value and direction, sought

for some order in these changes. He observed that frequently, in Tierra

del Fuego and in other countries in South America, cleavage planes were
inclined in opposite directions on opposite sides of an anticlinal, so as to dip
inwards*. The Alps, given as an example of this fan-like arrangement of
strata by Studerf , and the corresponding appearance previously recorded
by von Buch in Norway, are mentioned by Darwin as possibly related to
this phaenomenon of cleavage. Professor H. Rogers submitted to the Ame-
rican Association for the Advancement of Science, a further statement, that
"the cleavage dip is parallel to the average dip of Hie anticlinal and synclinal
axis planes, or those bisecting the flexures J." The Alps in this view are
supposed to have on their flanks many folds of strata, whose " axis planes"
 dip inwards; and parallel to these "axis planes "the cleavage structure is
 developed. The axis planes are more highly inclined at greater distances
 from the central summit ridge.

                                                                      Fig. 7.

                                                Hypothetical Sketcli Section of Alps.

     For the most detailed view yet presented on this subject we are indebted
 to Mr. D. Sharpe, now unhappily lost to science. According to Mr. Sharpe,
  if we trace geographically any particular plane of cleavage by following its
  strike 5, 10, 20 or more miles, we shall find it preserve, within narrow limits,
  the same angle of dip, and in the same direction. On proceeding a few miles to
  the right or left, and selecting a second plane of cleavage, it is probable that
  this will not dip at the same angle, possibly not in the same direction ; but
  this angle and this direction of dip are equally persistent along the line of
  strike to which they belong. When by repeated trials of this kind the struc-

  ture of a large tract of country is ascertained, it is found that along certain
  lines of strike some miles apart, the cleavage is vertical, or nearly so ; that
   near these lines the cleavage surfaces are steeply inclined toward them, but
  far from thera greatly inclined. Thus something like anticlinal and synclinal
   axes appear, and " systems of cleavage " are traced through countries which
   also manifest " systems of movement."

      Thus Mr. Sharpe states, that in North Wales a line of vertical cleavage
   runs N.E. and S.W. along the slate beds which lie on the western flank of
   the Snowdon chain ; another such line runs through the great slate quarries

  between Dinas Mowddy and Mallwyd. These lines are about 35 miles apart.

 --Between them the cleavage is inclined, near the north-western line the dips
 -- --are north-westward, near the south-eastern line they are south-eastward, the

   angle of inclination being least towards the middle part of the area included

I have lately followed

this section with attention
in Borrowdale, Watendlath
and Skiddaw. It appears

to correspond in the south-                                 S

ern part with the cleavage
dips of the region, but the

dips of the strata are more
various in direction and

angle than the section

shows. The cleavage dips
are vertical about Watend-

lath, and in the parallel
valley about Rosthwaite on
lines N. 67░ E. (E.N.E.)
In descending Borrowdal

as far as Bowderstone, this

direction of cleavage stiike
is frequently observable, with a dip to the southward growing less^and less

cleavage is to the N.N.W., about 80 .
The lines whose cleavage is vertical are

able folds of the strata. The dip of the
strata is most regular and continuous be-

facts of my survey agree in several fea-
tures with Mr. Sharpe's data, but they
conduct to somewhat different inferences.
There are not so much lines or axes as
several parallel bands in which the clea-
vage is vertical or deviates 5░ to 10 on
either side, and these bands are        rather
suddenly succeeded by others in
                                        which

the cleavage dips with considerable stea-
diness about 70░. Thus a band of verti-
cal and highly inclined cleavage passes
through Helvellyn; a band of c eavage
inclined 50░ to 70░ northwardly runs
through Grasmere and Rydal; a band ot

which induced Mr. Sharpe to emplojr the terms "anticlinal and synclinal,"
and to represent the lines of cleavage as parts of elliptical curves*, to which
however, they really bear but slight reseu'blance.

   It is further evident, that when the dips of the strata are most uniform in
direction, the cleavage also mostly dips in one direction ; and that where the
strata are subject to much contortion and frequent changes of dip, the
cleavage is either vertical, or deviates only a few degrees (5░ to 10░) on either
side of the vertical. For the most part the cleavage planes are steeper than

the surfaces of the strata.

   The most prevalent direction of the cleavage strike in Westmoreland is
E.N.E., varying however to E. and N.E. This corresponds nearly with the

strike of the beds. In the country east of Kendal, about Hougill Fells, it is

nearly E. and W. (N. 80░ E,, N. 85░ E.), In the same vicinity the beds strike

E.N.E. and N. 85░ E., or on the whole a little more to the northward. Pro-
ceeding to the S.E., we find cleavage well-developed in the clearly bedded
rocks of Ribblesdale, subjacent to the mountain limestone, which shows no
sign of cleavage. The beds of slate are marked by graptolites and shells; the
cleavage is always traceable. The beds are undulated on axes directed
between 15░ north of west, and 3░ north of west. (In a certain limited roll,
the strikes vary 37░ (from 22░ north of west to 15░ south of west). The
cleavage strike is nearly parallel, in a general sense, to the strike of the beds
it varies only 10░ (from 16░ north of west to 6░ north of west).) There is
one principal synclinal roll of the strata (b), with dips on the north side (n)
of 46░ to S.S.W.; on the south side (c) 60░, 73░, 80░ to N.N.E. ; then for a
narrow space the beds are vertical (d) ; after which is a broad band of dips

whole grow greater and greater toward the southern end ; so that beginning
in the northern part at 60░ and 66░, they augment in the synclinal roll to 72░,

south of it to 80░, and at length appear vertical, near the line of the North

Craven Fault, which ranges E.S.E., nearly parallel to the strike of the beds

and the cleavage. In Diagrams 16 and 17 these remarkable facts are ex-

pressed in a section from N. to S. in Ribblesdale, which may be compax-ed

with Diagrams No. !, 5, 6.
   As already observed, the rocks which form the needles and sharp crests on

the flanks of Mont Blanc, appeared to Studer and other geologists to be com-

posed of laminge which, viewed on a great scale, dip inward on each side of

the great chain, so as to produce in the section a fan-shnped structure; and

this has the more caught attention because the lowest in the scale of lamina-

tion contain organic remains and appear to be covered by crystalline schists,

--: the gneissic and granitic series of Mont Blanc. It appears to Mr. Sharpe

that these fan-shaped laniinaa are due to cleavage; that an anticlinal axis of

foliation shows itself between two lines of vertical foliation in Mont Blanc,

and  runs through  the  whole chain                                                      and  tliat there  is really  no superposition

of gneiss above fossiliferous strata. He traces across the region of the Swiss

Alps, nine of these parallel axes and ten vertical bands of cleavage and folia-

tion. The following is Mr. Sharpe's section* of the granitic or gneissic

mass (protogine) of Mont Blanc, and the strata adjoining which appear to

dip into or under the gneissic rocks.

   The Section No. 19 exhibits the same systems of cleavage and foliation,
the same axes, and the same verticals; the strata on the flanks of the Mont
Blanc are seen reposing against the gneiss, not dipping into or under it. The

gneiss is not supposed to be stratified, but foliated; the foliation being in

planes parallel to, and even continuous with, those of cleavage.

    Sedgwick seems to refer to such a case as one of imperfect cleavage,
marked by parallel planes at definite distances, which it might be difficult to
class with joints or cleavages.

    (b.) In other examples all the strata are traversed by cleavage, but not all
at the same angles of inclination.

    In this Diagram, taken by the author
from Leek Beck near Kirkby Lonsdale,
1823*, the letters indicate, as before, soft
and hard beds : the inclination of the
cleavage planes varies in these beds in
such a way, that in the harder bed they
deviate more from planes of stratification
than in the softer beds.

    Such cases were observed by the au-
thor in Wales, 1836; North Devon, 1839;
Cove of Cork, 184'3; by Sharpe in Lang-
dale, J849; by Townsend at Cork, 1854;
by Harkness in the S.W. of Ireland, 1855.

    (c.) Not unfrequently, when beds al-
ternate whose mineral aggregation is not
uniform, the cleavage surfaces are curved
in the remarkable manner shown in Dia-
gram 23.

    In this Diagram (23) the cleavage edges

seen in the principal section are bent, so
that at the surfaces of each bed they
tend to coincide with the stratification,
but in the middle of each bed they form a
considerable angle with the stratification.

The first example I ever saw of this was

at Sallenche, in the Liassic slate, at the

base of Mont Blanc, in 1830. I afterward

ob.'erved it at Dolbadarn, in North
Wales, in Westmoreland, and Devonshire.
Mr. Sharpe has since confirmed this state-
ment. It is sometimes possible to trace
near the bounding surfaces ol the beds
laminae (/) of deposition, and sometimes
the original distinction of beds is only
marked by such laminae.

    (d.) Cleavage surfaces are usually dis-
turbed when traversing or passing near to
masses of unequal hardness.

   When, as in Diagram 24', beds of slate

--enclose nodules of greater hardness, as

--limestone or ' calliard,' or ironstone, the

cleavage, which is perfect and continuous
in the mass of slate, becomes irregular and
interrupted so as to resemble a series of
cracks in the nodules ; these cracks follow
the law indicated in Diagram 21, and tra-
verse the nodules in directions more nearly

                                                    * Geol. Trans. 182a

perpendicular to the planes of the stratification than the cleavage planes are.

Carbonate of lime, or quartz, may often be found filling these cracks ; sul-

phuret of iron also occurs in them. The                  Fig. 25.
slaty laminae are somewhat twisted about

the nodules.

Mr. Sorby has given us an example

(Diagram 25) of the deviation of cleavage

planes in passing through a thin bed of

indurated gritstone, lying in fine-grained

slate near Ilfracombe. The strata being

subject to much pressure, the thin grit-

stone layer is bent in parallel folds, and is

of greatest thickness in the vertices of the

folds. In this remarkable case, which is

on a small scale, the cleavage laminas in

the slate are more or less parallel to the

axial planes of the folds ; but in the grit-

stone, they deviate into fan-shaped arrange-

ments, which on a small scale resemble the

laminar structure of Mont Blanc. Here

also, as in Diagram 21, the cleavage fissures,

on passing through the harder substance,

deviate toward a direction perpendicular

to its surface. When the axes of the con-

tortions of such a bed as g (the hard grit-

stone) pass in different directions, the clea-

vage invariably passes through the centre

of them in planes coincident with the axes.

This is on a small scale the same law as

that already quoted from Professor Rogers,

the cleavage plane in each case bisecting

the flexures. The author just named pre-

              Fig. 26.

sents us with a drawing (Diagram 26) very well suited to explain his idea of
tan-like cleavage planes, in materials of unlike nature, and bent anticlinally*.

Д 7. Cleavage accompa7iied by change of dimensions in Rochs.

In rocks subject to cleavage, the parts of the mass have undergone some

change of place                                                                       and  the whole  mass  has  suffered  compression  in  one di-

rection. This will be evident from the following facts :

   (a.) Surfaces of stratification are frequently undulated and wrinkled by
edges of cleavage.

Thus in Diagram 27, let S be a surface of stra-                                                                                Fig. 27.

Ktification,  a plane of cleavage, and J a vertical

joint. The cleavage edges are often traced on the

bed S by undulated, interrupted ridges and hollows,

which appear in no other surfaces, and suggested to

me the idea of a " creeping movement among the

particles of the rock, along the plane of cleavage, the

effect of which was to roll them forward, in a direc-

tion always uniform, over the same tract of country."

In this expression the term ' creep ' is borrowed from

experience in collieries, where argillaceous strata are

frequently thrown into undulations which slowly

propagate themselves under continued pressure.

These undulations are often formed on a plane highly inclined to the axis

of pressure, as in the case of slaty cleavage. The interrupted character of

the ridges and furrows on the plane of the strata arises sometimes from the

unequal yielding power of the materials.

(6.) These undulations are really due to pressure of some kind, and affect

the figure of shells and other flexible and compressible objects on the sur-

faces of the strata, so tliat in the direction of the dip of the strata these objects
are often much shortened in dimension.

Thus a thin object originally circular, fig. 28 (as Orbicula), becomes short-

ened to an elliptical figure, fig. 29, on the plane, and arched, as fig. 30, in the

section. Thus it is certain that the effect of cleavage is to cause relative
" motion among the parts of stratified rocks," such as would be produced

by a compression in the direction perpendicular to cleavage.

              Fig. 28.                                                                                           Fig. 29.

   I am not aware of any observations on record regarding these curious

pheenomena of change of place in the parts of a slaty mass prior to 1843,
when I communicated them with other facts to the British Association at
Cork*. One of the points then much insisted on was the fact of the move-

ment uniformly in the line of the dip of the strata of the parts of symmetrical

--fossils like trilobites, LingulcB, SpirifertB ; so that, when presented in one

direction, these objects were shortened, in a direction at right angles to the
former they were relatively lengthened (really narrowed), and in an inter-

mediate direction distorted, fig. 31. And the change of figure was employed
as a measure of the movement on the plane of stratification, viz. :j or ^ an
inch in the common trilobite of Llandeilo ( Ogygia Buchii), equals xoi^i or
ith of the whole space. The movement does not seem, in the case of Irish
or North Devon rocks, to have affected the thicker and harder shells, but

only those which were thin, as also the Algae and Trilobites ; the latter
in Llandeilo flags are often covered with little folds, or even thread-like
striations parallel to the wave of motion, fig. 32, which, when lying right
across the axis of figure, may deceive an inexperienced person into the sup-
position of a real transverse striation. The same thing occurs in North
Devon, and in the south of Ireland.

                                                                  Fig. 31.

--388 REPORT 1856.

   In the remarkable case sketched, the ridges and hollows assume a regu-
larity of wavy interruptions which appear the effect of concretionary forces
whose axes cross the bed, the concretions being subsequently pressed by

cleavage, so that the rock can sometimes be practically divided by art, and
in other cases is found actually divided by nature into irregular oblong
solids whose axis is parallel to the line of dip of the cleavage. Phaenomena
of this order are observable among the slaty rocks of Westmoreland (Win-
dermere Head, Bowness), and in some tracts of South Wales (Llandowror),

but they do not yield good slate.
   In some cases the irregular surface of the beds is apparently due to ori-

ginal ripple structure, which by the general movement of the mass of the

rock across the cleavage planes, have acquired superposed wrinkles parallel

to the cleavage edges. Thus in several cases may the planes of stratification

be clearly distinguished from joints.
   The steps thus placed for a mechanical theory of the series of changes by

which the structural characters and accidents of position in slate rocks might
be determined, were relaid with care, and strengthened by new observations,

by Mr. D. Sharpe*.
   In the quarries of South Petherwin, where argillaceous, ochraceous, and

calcareous beds occur, the former are wholly cleft, the latter partially so, or
rather cracked, the soft ochreous beds not marked by cleavage. In tlie argil-

laceous slate the thinner and more tender fossils are much changed in figure,
the encrinite columns not so. The distortion is greatest where the angle
between the planes of cleavage and stratification is least. The contraction of

of cleavage, is estimated at one-fourth, and there is an expansion in the

--plane of cleavage on the line of the dip. Mr. Sharpe's general result is

expressed in these distinct terms : " From these and similar cases, we learn

that the shells have been compressed by a force acting in a direction perpen-
dicular to the planes of cleavage, and that the compression of the mass

between the cleavage planes has been counterbalanced by its expansion in

a direction corresponding to the dip of the cleavage." And again, "As
the expansion of the rock in one direction may have been caused by its com-

pression in the contrary direction, it follows that all the eff'ects yet described

may have originated in the compression of the mass of the rock in a direction
perpendicular to the cleavage planes." The oblique pressures which appear

to have affected many shells in the planes of stratification and produced such
extraordinary distortions as that of Spirifera disjuncta (Diagram 34 a, com-
pared with 34 b), " may always be resolved into the same two direct forces

one forwards along the plane of cleavage towards the intersection of the

cleavage and the bedding, the other downwards in a direction perpendicular

to the cleavage. When the bedding and cleavage exactly coincide at Tin-

--tagel, the shells are flattened and drawn out considerably, even 50 per cent,

in one direction," the direction

being, doubtless, that of the line

of dip of the cleavage planes.

Mr. Sharpe thus concludes this

part of his investigation :

   " It may be asserted as probable,
that all rocks affected by that pe-
culiar fissile character which we

call slaty cleavage have under-

gone,

sume that the masses of rock have not been altered in that direction."

    These conclusions, presented in IS^e, on the sure evidence of the changed
forms of shells, trilobitts, &c., were extended in 1848 to slates in which no
traces of any organic forms had been observed. The evidence in this case
was found by examination of the mechanical structure of the slates, especially

by certain apparently brecciated slates including masses of discernible mag-
nitude, and distinct colour and quality. Such are frequent in Westmoreland

and Cumberland about Rydal, in Langdale, Patterdale and Borrowdale.
" In all these slaty breccias, the included masses are flatter between the

--planes of cleavage than in any other direction. Their flattest sides are always

parallel to the cleavage planes, they are usually rather longer on the line of

--dip of the cleavage than along the strike, thus confirming the opinion that

the rocks have expanded in the direction of the dip of the cleavage."

somewhat elongated in the line of

pearance of similar masses on the

edge of the same sheet of slate, the

It is curious to observe in some of

these brecciated slates which have

undergone much metamorphosis,

crystals which have suffered no

change by compression. These cry-

stals (e. g. garnets) have probably

been generated in the mass by the

metamorphic actions consequent on

communicated heat.

   It is obvious, that with such a                           t
structure the easy cleavage of slate

in parallel planes is completely pro-

vided for. Moreover, in each sheet

of slate, where the parts are sensibly

extended in the direction of dip,

there is a somewhat greater facility of fracture in that direction than in any
other. This comparative facility of fracture is called by Mr. Sharpe "se-
condary cleavage*;" it is of some importance in the working of slate, and
gives rise to the terms " end " (e in fig. 35), and "side" {s in fig. 36).
Slates are best split by inserting the tool at the end.

the structure of rocks by the microscope, and especially by the use of thin

sections, he has applied this method of research to ascertain the origin of

slaty cleavage. In the course of a careful examination of contortions in North

Wales and Devonshire, he was convinced that they indicate a very con-

siderable amount of lateral pressure, the thickness of the contorted beds being

very different in one part to what it is in another (see Diagram 25). In the

case referred to, the amount of compression inferred is so great, that points

which appear to have been 38 inches apart, are now at the distance of only

9 inches. Unyielding parts have been contorted, yielding parts simply pressed

together in one direction and extended in another. The green spots so often

seen in purple slate, also indicate great change of dimensions in the mass. In

rocks without cleavage they appear spherical ; in cleaved slates they are found

to be compressed in the perpendicular to cleavage, elongated in the line of its

dip ; so that, if originally spherical, they have become ellipsoids of three

dimensions, the shortest axis lying across the cleavage, the longest in the

line of cleavage dip, while the third axis of intermediate length coincides

with the strike of the cleavage. These three axes, in a case not supposed to

be extreme, though doubtless above the average, in the slates of Llanberis

and Penrhyn, are found as 1 : 3'75 : 6 ; from which it follows that the sphere

has been compressed to less than half the original bulk (as 3'75^ to

1 X 3-75 X 6-0), or as 100 to 43.

In a mass so compressed, the relative angular positions       Fig. 37.

of all the particles not exactly perpendicular to the line

of pressure or exactly parallel to it would be changed.

Supposing the particles, or some of them, to be unsym-

metrical (as they mostly are in the brecciated slates, and

indeed in most kinds of slate), and that their lengths

were equally presented in all directions, or inclined at

--all angles to the plane perpendicular to the line of pres-

sure, we shall find after compression their inclination

6' by the formula tan 0'=-         where c is the ratio of

the longer to the shorter axis of the ellipse representing
the compression, 6 the original angle, and d' the angle
to which it has been changed by compression. In the

case assumed above c=6, where and 6' appear in the

    These numbers exhibit the relative tendency to cleavage

in each arc of 10░ in the compressed mass. If instead of

5░ on each side of a given position we had assumed a very

small angle only, the tendency to fissility along the prin-

cipal cleavage plane, as compared to that perpendicular to

it in the line of strike, would have been as 36 : 1.

   The structure here assigned by calculation does actu-

ally occur in slaty rocks, but not in others. " The water

of Ayr stone, which has no cleavage, consists of mica and a very few grains
of quartz sand, imbedded in a large proportion of decomposed felspar ; the
peroxide of iron being collected to certain centres, and having the character
of peroxidized pyrites. The flakes of mica do not lie in the plane of the
bedding, but are inclined at all angles ; so that there is no definite plane of
structural weakness independent of that due to bedding." But in a rock of

similar composition having cleavage, a section cut perpendicular to cleavage
in the line of its dip, shows by far the greater part of the flakes of mica in-
clined at low angles, so that the majority lie within 20░ on each side of it,

--being most numerous in and nearly in the plane of cleavage, twenty times

as many nearly in it as nearly in the plane of 45░ to it, and very few at 90░.
In a section perpendicular to cleavage, and in the line of strike, there is still
a preponderance of flakes of mica in and near the plane of cleavage, but in
a less marked degree. On the plane of cleavage itself, a slight tendency to
arrangement of the flakes parallel to the line of dip is observable.

   One of the latest and most instructive of Mr. Sorby 's observations relates
to the cleavage of Devonian limestones. In a specimen from Kings Kerswell

near Torquay, the cleavage pressure has affected the whole mass of the rock,

including the encrinites, which are found with their substance compressed
and crushed so as to occupy, in the direction of the perpendicular to cleavage,
only a quarter of the space they fill in the direction of cleavage dip. Thus
the originally nearly equiaxed cells of the encrinital stem are altered by
cleavage to elongated fusiform shapes, whose longer axes are parallel, and
four times as great as the shorter axes. Even crystals of calcareous spar and
dolomite are found crushed, bent and broken up, so as to be with difficulty
recognizable.

   The instances thus collected of the movements of the parts of the rocks
subject to slaty cleavage, in directions normal to the planes of cleavage, have
been, if possible, made more convincing by imitative experiments, which
show that some of the phaenomena of cleavage are attainable by means of
pressure in materials composed of particles capable of change of figure, or
change of position. Mr. Sorby, observing by the microscope that iu certain
uncleaved stones (e.g. water of Ayr stone) mica occurred in plates inclined

--evenly in all directions, while in slates in which cleavage was manifest the

mica was found more collected on the cleavage planes and inclined at low

--angles to it, a circumstance directly deducible from the phaenomena of com-
--pression already proved, made a cleavable mass in the following manner*:

He mixed scales of oxide of iron with soft pipe-clay, so that the scales lay

evenly in all direction as in water of Ayr stone, and then pressed it so as
as to alter the dimensions of th.e mass in the same proportion as the slate of
Llanberis already referred to. Having then dried and baked it, he examined
the interior state of the substance by rubbing smooth faces, one face perpen-
dicular to pressure and in the line of elongation or dip; another in what
represented the line of strike, and a third face in the plane of the pressure
corresponding to the cleavage plane. The particles of oxide of iron were
found distributed just as mica is in well-cleaved slate; the mass was capable

of easily splitting parallel to the pressure planes, but not across them.
    Professor Tyndall has more recently taken up this part of the subject,

and has produced a variety of results, confirming and extending the inge-
nious reasonings and experiments of Mr. Sorby f- Perhaps his most re-
markable experiment is tliat made with pure white wax, which in the ordi-
nary state admits of fracture in all dii^ections equally, and contains no
unequiaxed particles like mica and scales of oxide of iron. This substance,
being subject to pressure:!:, is found to have acquired true slaty structure,
even in a higher degree than any known slate, for it splits to much finer and
more equal laminae. " The finer the slate the more perfect will be the resem-
blance of its cleavage to that of the wax," is the conclusion of the author of
this instructive experiment.

   The experiments and reasonings of Professor Tyndall, Mr. Sorby, and
Mr. Sharpe, will again come under review in a future Report, when the theory
of slaty cleavage may be examined, and the 'mechanical pressure' which
these authors advocate may be placed in comparison with the crystalline
polarity, formerly advanced by Prof. Sedgwick. The veined structure of
glaciers, which reminded Professor J. Forbes of the analogous lamination in

-- --slates, an idea since expressed by Rogers and Tyndall, and Mr. Fox's in-

genious imitation of slaty cleavage by electrical currents passing through
clay, will then receive the attention which they merit.

                                  Д 8. Secondary Cleavage of Slate.

     It is difficult to break slates of the usual thickness (about ^th of an inch)
 so as to produce surfaces even rudely rectangled to the plane of cleavage ; a
 circumstance which need occasion no surprise. But in this respect two

 lines may be chosen in the slate, along one of which the rudely perpendi-

--cular fracture may occasionally be looked for; this is the line of dip, on

 the other it can hardly be produced even with the utmost care ; this is

 parallel to the strike. In experiments for this purpose, it should be observed
 whether the surfaces produced by fracture on lines parallel to the strike
 tend to parallelism. If a sheet of slate be laid on two supports parallel to

 and equidistant from the strike edges, it may be found that at one of these
 edges fracture will be more easy than at the other. Then turn over the

 slate to see if the facts will be reversed, and the other edge give the easiest

 fracture. [An observation in the affirmative is in my note book, for 1836,
 at Llanberis. I shall be glad to know if it has been noticed by others in

 this or other localities.]

    Hence it appears probable, that besides the principal cleavage, some slates
 contain a secret lamination, or ' secondary cleavage,' which occasions a par-
 tial fissility ; but in general this kind of structure produces no such distinct
 appearances in the blocks and masses as to be often recognized on a great
 scale. Some cases in which I had supposed such a structure to be real and
 important, turned out on further research to be merely examples of symme-
 trical jointing. Prof. Sedgwick, however, refers me for satisfactory instances
 to the old black slates of Buttermere, and to the vicinity of Yspytty Evan, in
 North Wales.

    One of the cases in which a second set of cleavage planes was supposed to
 cross the principal cleavage frequently and regularly, is the " pencil bed "
 of Skiddaw slate dug in Westmoreland, near Shap. Mr. Sharpe has exa-
 mined this curious rock, and finds in one case (Thornthwaite Gill) the prin-
 cipal cleavage parallel to the original beds and dipping N.W. 60░ ; the

 secondary cleavage crosses it nearly at right angles and dips S.E. between
 20░ and 30░. In another case (Rosgill Moor) the beds dip N.E. 30░ ; the

principal cleavage N. by W. 60░; the secondary cleavage S. by E. 15░. By

 natural decomposition, small square prisms are produced, whose sides mea-
sure one-quarter to half an inch across, and these may be sometimes split
again parallel to the faces. Mr. Sorby has found proof that this so-called
'secondary cleavage' is due to many small parallel joints.

  --The following case occurred to me in North Wales, in 1836: A sheet of

slate was excavated into a notch on one dip-edge, and the other struck by a
heavy tool on the opposite point (the plane of cleavage being held vertical)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

it yielded along a zigzag line so as to show two sets of planes on the fracture

+meeting each other at 90░ on the plane of cleavage, but with a common

edge oblique to the plane (70░ and 110░). This I regard as a case of secret
jointing, and wish to know if any thing of the kind has been observed by others.

                                 Д 9. Relation of Cleavage to Joints,

   The joints which traverse cleavage, in well-cleaved and massive slate rocks,
show much regularity for short spaces, and often present the same or nearly
equal angles of intersection. After examining and measuring innumerable
instances, I believe that this apparent symmetry is not delusive, and that by

a careful classification of joints with reference to the plane of stratification
and the plane of cleavage, some data of importance in the theory of their

origin may be obtained. An example of joints seen on a plane of stratifica-

a space of 30 feet on the north and 17 feet on the south of the dyke, the
sandstones and marls are changed in hardness, texture and structure, so that
for these breadths they are excavated with the trap ; and from their density,
hardness, and resemblance to basalt, amygdaloid or porphyry, may be easily
mistaken for primeval rocks of fusion. They have been literally baked under

--pressure, not roasted with freedom of access and escape for volatile matter."
   " In regarding the structures of the stratified rocks, we observe that on
approaching toward the dyke the stratification grows less distinct and sud-
denly becomes untraceable ; that instead of it, especially on the south side,
a great abundance of angularly intersecting dirisional planes occur, so as to

produce prismatic structures perpendicular to the plane of the dyke. Further,

we observe, parallel to the dyke, to a distance of 30 or more feet from it,

several very long, very straight, nearly vertical joints, continuous through all
the beds, without any sign of vertical displacement, or any mark of lateral
disturbance, unless the appearance of broad striation or narrow fluting,
which horizontally marks the vertical sandstone surface, 30 feet from the
dyke on the north side, be of the nature of slickenside, and referrible to
lateral movement*."

    If these examples be attentively considered, it will appear that under the

--circumstances described heat being probably the principal agent, and pres-

--sure very little if at all evident the following changes occur, near to and

 parallel to the heating surfaces :

           1. Extinction of the stratified structure.

         2. Production of a new structure.
          3. Accon)panied in one case by great molecular and mineral changes.
    But it must be remarked, that the change indicated in the second of these
sentences is really distinct from that which slate has undergone. Slate is
cleavable in all its parts, more or less perfectly ; because its ultimate mole-
 cular texture is altered to such a condition ; near these dykes the rocks are
 cleft indeed, but not further cleavable ; split, but not traversed by numerous

 planes of easy fissility.

    I have seen phaenomena of a somewhat similar character, but less marked,
 near great faults, as, for example, in the line of the Craven fault in

 Yorkshire.

                                       Д11. The Cleat in Coal.

     In the northern coal districts of England, and in other tracts, there exists,
 besides the lamination parallel to the bounding surfaces of the beds, a series
 of approximate often nearly vertical divisional surfaces, along which the
 coal admits of easy fissility. This structure is called cleat, and it is of the
 greatest importance in coal working, since parallel to it the ' headways' are
 driven in the ' post and stall ' workings of Northumberland and Durham, and
 parallel to it the ' banks' are wrought in the ' long wall' and 'board and end'
 systems of Yorkshire and Derbyshire. Cleat is little aff'ected by fractures,

--or undulations of the strata. It has usually one persistent course across a

 large district, the same direction often obtains in neighbouring districts, and
  even prevails over the whole of a great carboniferous region, 'rhus in North-
 umberland and Durham the cleat runs most generally to the north-west (true);
  its 'strike' is in that direction. The most general strike of the beds is to
  the N.N.E. The same direction of cleat is prevalent in Yorkshire and
  Derbyshire, and this whether the beds strike eastward, as near Leeds and
  Sheffield ; or southward, as near Huddersfield and Chesterfield. The same
  direction prevails in Lancashire.

* Memoirs of Geological Survey of Great Britain, vol. ii. pt. 1, p. 156.
--396 REPORT 1856.

    There are some cases in which the cleat varies in its direction from the
 normal strike, and degree or inclination, even (as I have been informed*) in
different parts of one bed of coal. From frequent inspections of cleat in
its ordinary state and near trap dykes and near faults, I conceive that no
doubt can exist of its being a peculiar structure, more resembling the effect
of aggregation under polar attractions than anything else. Coal affected by
it is not properly 'cleavable' like slate, but actually cleft into numerous
parallel, nearly vertical tables, whose general direction is remarkably uniform
amidst many variations of other concomitant conditions.

    Neither heat nor pressure seem to be specially indicated by the phaeno-
mena of cleat, which on the whole most resemble the jointed structure of
rocks, where that is manifested on the smallest scale and in greatest regu-
larity, i.e. where the dips of the strata are most uniform, and all the conco-
mitant conditions are the most regular. Joints, like cleat, have very preva-
lent directions in given districts, and inclinations to the strata tending to one
angular value in one bed. In parallel beds of the same mineral nature and
in the same series of strata, their strike and dip are often the same. In beds
of a different mineral nature joints vary in character ; and in a given series

of argillaceous, calcareous and coarse arenaceous rocks, we may find many

plane close joints in the argillaceous beds, inclined 70░ ;H to the strata ; a
few large continuous Jissiires in the limestone nearly perpendicular to the
beds; and a varying number oi irregular rents in the sandstone.

  --Addendum (1857). Very lately Professor Haughton has instituted accu-

rate measures and calculations founded on the distortion of fossils in cleaved
rocks, and has obtained numerical results which concur with those of
Mr. Sharpe and Mr. Sorby already referred to, in regard to the proof of
pressure in a direction perpendicular to the cleavage plane; they, however,
for the most part, do not indicate greater relative extension on the line of
cleavage dip than on the line of cleavage strikef.

                 [A communication ordered to be printed entire among the Reports.]

All the classes of the animal kingdom, when viewed in relation to their

stratigraphical distribution, are not of the same value to the palaeontologist.
Some Mollusca, as the Conchifera and Gasteropoda, have a much greater
extension in time than the Cephalopoda, and among the Radiata, Corals and
Echinoderms may be adduced as examples of classes whose species had a
limited life in time; in estimating the value of palaeontological evidence, it is
therefore necessary to take into consideration this important fact, which has
not received the attention it is so justly entitled to.

   The Echinodermata, although occupying a low position in the animal
series, in a zoological point of view, still afford the palaeontologist most

important data for discussing questions relative to the distribution of species

in time and space, for it is well known that the Silurian, Devonian, and Car-
boniferous rocks are all characterized by distinct forms of Crinoidea, most of

 1834.

which are limited in their range to the different stages of these great groups.
It is the object of. this paper to show that the species of the Oolitic Echino-
dermata had a limited range in time, and that the different stages of the
Oolitic formations are characterized by species which are special to each.

   Dr. William Smith was doubtless aware of the value of the Echinodermata
in stratigraphical geology, for he carefully noted the different species known
to him which characterized the secondary rocks ; and it is a remarkable
fact, that although our knowledge of the species of this class has been
nearly quadrupled since the publication of his works *, still the outlines
sketched by the hand of our great master remain nearly the same as laid out
by him.

   The test of the Echinodermata constitutes an internal and integral part of
the body of the animal, participating in its life, intimately connected with the
organs of digestion, respiration, and generation, as well as with those of vision
and locomotion, and having consequently many of the distinctive characters
of the organism indelibly impressed on portions of its skeleton. The individual
plates which compose the columns of the test of the Echinoidea, and the
ossicula which form the skeletons of the Asteroidea, Ophiuroidea, and
Crinoidea, are organized after distinct plans; they are therefore of great

value in determining the species, as the specific characters are often well pre-
served on even fragmentary portions of the skeleton ; for this reason the
remains of this class are of the highest value in stratigraphical geology, and
second to no other class of the animal kingdom in importance.

    In the Echinoidea the body is spheroidal, oval, depressed or discoidal,
and enclosed in a calcareous test or shell composed of ten columns of large
plates constituting the inter-ambulacral areas ; and ten columns of small plates
constituting the ambulacral areas, which segments are separated from each
other by ten rows of holes constituting the poriferous zones. '1 he external

surface of the plates is studded with tubercles of different sizes, in the dif-
ferent families; to these are articulated, by a kind of ball-and-socket joint,
the spines, which are of different sizes, forms, and dimensions in the different
families, and serve to characterize the genera and species.

    At the summit of the test is the apical disc, composed of five genital plates
perforated for the passage of the ovarial and seminal canals; and five ocular
plates notched or perforated for lodging the eyes : in one family, the Sale-
Ni adjE, an additional or suranal plate, composed of one or many pieces, is in-
troduced within the circle formed by the genital and ocular plates.

    There are two great apertures in the shell, one for the mouth, which is
alwa3's at the base ; the other for the anus, which occupies different positions
 on the test; in one section it is in the centre of the upper surface, directly
opposite to the mouth, and surrounded by the genital and ocular plates ; in a
second section the vent is external to the circle of genital plates, and never
 opposite to the mouth, but situated in different positions in relation to that
 opening, being placed on the upper surface, on the sides, the border, the infra-
 border or the base, in the different groups.

    The mouth is sometimes armed with a complicated apparatus of jaws and
 teeth, but it is sometimes edentulous, or provided with lobes formed of the

 plates of the test itself.

    The Asteroidea have a depressed stelliform body provided with five or
 more lobes or hollow arms, which are a continuation of the body, and contain
 prolongations of the viscera. The mouth is always below and central, and
 rows of tubular retractile suckers occupy the centre of the rays. The com-

plicated skeleton is composed of numerous solid calcareous ossicula, variable
as to number, size and arrangement in the different genera which they serve
to characterize. Their coriaceous integument is studded with calcareous
spines of various forms, and they have a spongy madreporiform body on the
upper surface of the disc near the angle between two rays ; reptation is accom-
plished by the retractile tubular ambulacral suckers.

   The Ophiuroidea have a distinct depressed discoidal body provided with
long slender arms, in which there is no excavation for any prolongation of

the viscera ; they are special organs of locomotion, independent of the visceral
cavity, and provided with spines which are developed on their sides ; the

mouth is basal and central, and surrounded by membranous tentacula. The
skeleton is composed of a series of plates which form the disc or centrum,
and the long slender rays are sustained by numerous elongated vertebrate-
like ossicula, having numerous plates or spines disposed along the borders
of the rays to assist in reptation. The form, structure and arrangement
of the discal plates, and of the ossicles of the rays, afford good characters for

distinguishing the genera.

   The Crinoidea have a distinct bursiform body formed of a calyx, com-
posed of a definite number of plates, provided with five solid rays, which are
independent of the visceral cavity, and adapted for prehension ; they have a
distinct mouth and vent, no retractile suckers, and the ovaries open at the
base of the arms into special apertures. The skeleton is extremely compli-
cated, being composed of many thousands of ossicula closely articulated to-
gether, the number, form and arrangement of which are determinate in the
different families, the multiples of five being the numbers which in general

predominate ; the central plate of the calyx is supported on a long jointed
column composed of circular, pentagonal or stelliform plates, the articulating
surfaces of which are sculptured with crenulations that interlock into each

other ; in many genera the stem was attached by a calcareous root to the bed
of sea, and supported the calyx and arms upwards like a plant; in others it
appears to have been moveable, and was used as a point of suspension from
submarine bodies, the calyx and arms having had a pendent position.

    The mouth is central and prominent, and the vent opens near its side ; the
arms are mostly ramose and multiarticulate, and when extended they formed

a net-like instrument of considerable dimensions.

   The four orders of the Echinodermata thus briefly described are the only ones
found fossil in the oolitic rocks, and of these by far the largest number of
species belong to the Echinoidea ; for this order I have proposed the fol-
lowing classification, which differs in many essential particulars from that of

 previous authors.

    As the mouth is always basal, central, subcentral, or excentral, the excen-

 tricity being invariably towards the anterior border, this aperture does not
 afford a character of primary importance, although when taken in connexion
 with others it is valuable in the definition of families.

    The position of the anal opening affords a good primary character; in one
 section the vent opens within the centre of the apical disc, surrounded by
 the genital and ocular plates ; in another section the vent opens without the
 apical disc, and is external to, and at a greater or less distance from, the genital
 and ocular plates : these two sections may be thus defined.

plates. Mouth always armed with five powerful calcareous jaws, formed
of many elements disposed in a vertical direction.

    B. Test sometimes circular and hemispherical, oftener oblong, pentagonal,
depressed, clypeiform or discoidal ; mouth central or excentral ; vent ex-
ternal to the circle of genital and ocular plates, never opposite the mouth, but
situated in diflferent positions in relation to that opening : four of the genital
plates are generally perforated. The mouth is sometimes armed with jaws,
but is oftener edentulous. The jaws are disposed in a more or less horizontal

direction.

   The structure of the ambulacral areas and poriferous zones, the form,
number, and arrangement of the tubercles and their spines, the presence or
absence of fascioles or semitae, the size and form of the elements of the apical
disc, and the position of the anus, afford collectively good characters for de-

fining the genera.

   The minute details in the structure of the plates ; the size, form, and
number of the tubercles on each ; the form and arrangement of the pores in
the zones ; their proximity or remoteness from each other ; the general out-
line of the body, which has only certain limits of variation ; the character of
the sculpture on the plates ; the form of the areolas ; the greater or less pro-
minence of the base ; the size of the tubercle ; the presence or absence, the
size and arrangement of the granules forming the areolar circle ; the com-
pleteness or incompleteness of the same ; the width of the miliary zone, the
number and size of the rows of granules composing it ; tfce length of the spines;
the form of their stems ; the character of the sculpture on them ; the size of

--the head, and the prominence and milling of the ring, are all details of struc-

ture which individually and collectively afford good specific characters, as
they are persistent details which are more or less developed on every consider-
able fragment of the test and spines of the Echinoidea.

   Taking these characters for our guidance,! have grouped the genera, already
so numerous by the discovery of extinct forms, into the following natural

 families :

Order Crinoidea. All the species belonging to the families Cidarjdje,

The Lias species appear to be special to the three subdivisions of that for-

mation, so well characterized by the species of Ammonites which indicate these
three zones of Liassic life. The Inferior Oolite contains forty-three spe-

cies, of which forty are Echinoidea, one Asteroidea, and two are Cri-

NOiDEA ; of these, ten species extend into the Great Oolite, and seven species
pass into the Cornbrash; the Inferior Oolite has therefore twenty-six species

which up to this time have not been found in any other formation, and all the

species from the Lias to the Cornbrash included became extinct before the

deposition of the Kelloway rock and Oxford clay. The Fuller's earth has

yielded no remains of Echinoderms ; the Stonesfield slate contains six species,
most of which are special to this fissile oolitic rock. The Great Oolite has

yielded twenty- six species, of which nine extend into the Cornbrash, but seven-
teen are special to the Great Oolite stage. The eight species of the Bradford

clay are mostly common to this argillaceous bed, and the Great Oolite lime-
stone on which it rests. The Forest Marble contains seven species, of which
four are common to this rock and the Cornbrash, which contains seventeen

species, most of which are found in the older formations ; with the deposition
of the Cornbrash the lower division of the Oolites terminate, and with it all

the species of Echinodermata found in these rocks became extinct.
   The middle division of the Oolites contains far fewer species than the lower.

The Kelloway rock and Oxford clay, so rich in Cephalopoda, have not in
England, as far as 1 can learn, yielded any remains of Echinodermata. The

Lower Calcareous grit, the Coral rag, and Upper Calcareous grit, have
several species in common ; of the nine species of the Lower Calcareous grit,
five are common to it and the Coral rag, which contains twenty species; but
I have not ascertained how many, if any, pass into the Upper Calcareous grit;

in fact these three stages in reality represent only one stratigraphical zone of

life.

   The Kimmeridge clay up to the present time is known to contain only
four species, which are all special to it. There is one species only in the
Portland sand, and one in the Marine Purbeck beds. The Portland Oolitic
limestone is said to contain the remains of Echinoderms, but I have not been
able to obtain any of the specimens for examination.
           TENSILE STRENGTH OF BOILER PLATE.   406

On the Tensile Strength of Wrought Iron at various Temperatures.
                 By William Fairbairn, F.R.S. ^c.

On a previous occasion I had the honour of conducting, for the Association,

a series of experiments to determine the effects of temperature on the

strength of cast iron. In that inquiry I endeavoured to show to what extent

the cohesion of that material was affected by change of temperature, and

taking into account the rapidity with which iron imbibes caloric, and the

facility with which it parts with it, it is equally interesting to know to what

extent wrought iron is improved or deteriorated by similar changes. In the

present inquiry, as in the former on cast iron, the expansion of the metal

by heat is not the question for solution. Rondelet, Smeaton and others have

already investigated that subject, and it now only remains for us to deter-

mine the effects produced on the strength of malleable iron by changes of

--temperature, varying from 30░ of Fahrenheit to a red heat, perceptible in

daylight.

The immense number of purposes to which iron is applied, and the changes

of temperature to which it is exposed, render the present inquiry not only

interesting, but absolutely essential to a knowledge of its security under the

varied influences of those changes ; and when it is known that most of our

iron constructions are exposed to a range of temperature varying from the

extreme cold of winter to the intense heat of summer, it is assuredly desirable

to ascertain the effects produced by these causes on a material from which

we derive so many advantages, and on the security of which the safety of

the public not unfrequently depends.

Independent of atmospheric influences, another consideration presents

itself in reference to the durability and ultimate stability of iron under
changes much greater than those alluded to above, and this is the strength

of such vessels as pans and boilers subjected to the extreme temperatures of

boiling liquids on one side, and the intense heat of a furnace on the other.

But even these extremes, however great, do not seem seriously to affect the

cohesive strength of wrought-iron plates, nor do they appear to cause any

disruption of the laminated structure which results from the system of piling

and rolling adopted in the manufacture, excepting only where small particles

of scoria happen to intervene between the laminated surfaces. These not

unfrequently prevent a perfect welding, as the plate is compressed by

passing through the rolls, and the effects of temperature are strikingly

exhibited in the production of large blisters upon the surface of the plate, as

shown in the annexed sketch at

Nowa, a.   the reason of this is      Fig. I.

the want of solidity and homo-

geneity in the plate, and the con-

sequent expansion of the lower

part exposed to the greatest heat. Let us suppose, for the sake of illustra-

tion, the plate to be fths of an inch thick, and the surface b to be the inte-
rior of a boiler-plate, and the surface a, a to be exposed to the action of the

fire in the furnace. In this case it is evident that the temperature of the side

a, a may be upwards of 1000░, while that of b is very little above 212░, or

the temperature of boiling water ; and supposing there be any imperfection or

want of soundness in the plate, the result will he a greater expansion on the

exterior surface, causing it to rise up in blisters in the manner we have de-
--406 REPORT 1856.

scribed. These defects are invariably present when the plates are not sound ;
but in other respects, where the bars which form the pile are clear and free

from rust or scoria, and are well-welded in the rolling process, the wide dif-

ference between the temperature of one side and that of the other produces,

apparently, no injurious effect on the strength of the plate. It is, however,

widely different when the whole of the plates are exposed to the same de-

gree of temperature, as in this position the strengths are increased or dimi-

nished according as the temperature approaches or recedes from the point

where the strength is a maximum.

In order to show how the results were obtained, it will be necessary to

describe the apparatus and the mode of conducting the experiments.

The apparatus consisted of a powerful wrought-iron lever, Plate IV. A,

figs. 2 and 3, capable of imparting a force of more than 100,000 lbs,, or 45 tons
per square inch to the specimen to be broken. The lever is supported in a

cast-iron standard or frame B, arranged for the reception of specimens of the

material to be subjected to a crushing force or tensile strain. On the short

arm of the lever the plates and bars (one of which is seen at a) were

suspended by a shackle c, and held down to the bottom of the cast-iron

standard by the rod and screw e; on this rod the box, b, was fixed, and pre-

pared to hold a bath of oil or water, in which the iron to be broken Avas

immersed. Below this box was a fire-grate, d, for heating the liquid in the

bath to the required temperature, and this grate could be drawn backwards

from the box b, when the required temperature was attained or when it be-

came too high. The fulcrum of the lever is shown atf, and the scale in
which the weights were placed at g. The cast-iron standard was firmly

bolted to the heavy balks of timber upon which it stands, and the pressure on

the specimen was adjusted by placing weights in the scale.

The plates experimented upon were of the form shown in fig. 4, reduced

at a, to 2\ inches wide, and at 6 to 2 inches wide, in order to secure frac-
ture at the part of the plate immersed in the liquid in the bath. At each

end two holes are drilled                       '░'
to receive the bolt which

fixed them in the shackles.              "V_         H╗ o

point where the temperature was raised or lowered to the required degree.

 --With these preparations, the experiments proceeded as follows : the bar

to be broken was fixed between the shackles of the lever; and, if necessary,
the bath was filled, and the fire drawn close under it; as soon as the intended
temperature was attained, the lever was let down by the crab, and weights
carefully added to the scale until the bar broke. During the process the
temperature was observed from time to time, and the fire adjusted accord-

of strength can only be accounted for by some defect not perceptible when the

Collecting the results of these experiments, tabulated above, it will be

necessary to exhibit them in a more condensed form, so as to facilitate com-

parison, and to deduce the laws which regulate the tensile strength of wrought

Weiron.  may then apply the results of these experiments to a much greater

variety of plates produced in the different districts of England. It will be

borne in mind that the ordinary Staffordshire plates, such as those experi-

mented upon (unless they are double-worked), are rather inferior in quality

to the Shropshire and Derbyshire plates, and much more so to those manu-

factured at the Lowmoor and Bowling Works. Hence the comparison will

only hold good between the Staffordshire plates in each case.

   From the experimental inquiry into the strength of wrought-iron plates,
as applied to ship-building, we have the following results* :
TENSILE STRENGTH OF RIVET IRON.                                        415

                   Experiments on the Tensile Strength of Rivet Iron.

   At the time when the preceding experiments were instituted, it was con-
sidered expedient to make them on plates of ordinary quality, and of the de-
scription in general use. For this purpose Staffordshire plates were selected,
as being of medium quality, such as arc employed in the construction of boilers,
ship-building, &c. Plates of a higher character, such as the Lowmoor and
double-worked (\ndX\\\es, might have been selected ; but those most in demand,
and which are manufactured in large quantities, Avere considered more de-
sirable, although it left untouched a question of some importance in regard
to the influence of heat upon the finer qualities, generally known as " scrap "
and "faffotted" iron. This description of iron is forged from old iron scrap,
and rolled into bars for bolts and rivets. It is a fine ductile iron of great
tenacity, and works freely under the hammer; and it was determined to apply
to it the same experimental tests as had been applied to the Staffordshire

plates.

   From the results of these experiments, it will be seen that they indicate
precisely the same law as was found to influence the Staffordshire plates,
the maximum strength being at a temperature of 325░, rather higher than
that indicated by the plates. This is irrespective of the superior strength of
the bar iron as compared with that of the plates.

   Having prepared the lever, as before, a long bar, |-ths of an inch in
diameter, was selected and cut into lengths, which were then reduced to the
form shown in the
annexed sketch,

with shoulders to

receive the shackle. The specimens, when immersed in the bath, were drawn
asunder by the same process as that described for the plates.

    In this experiment, as in those on the plates, the tenacity of the iron is
seriously injured before the temperature reaches dull red heat ; and when that
point is attained, it has lost more than one-half its powers of resistance to
strain. At this high temperature it becomes exceedingly ductile and weak
when subjected to any description of force, inasmuch as it becomes so pliable
that it is immaterial whether the strain applied is compressive, tensile or
torsional. Under any of these forces it is not to be depended upon at a
temperature bordering upon redness.

    Collecting the results of the foregoing experiments in their consecutive

order into a Table, we see that the maximum strength of bars appears to be
attained at a mean temperature of about 320░. This is above the tempera-
ture at which the maximum strength of the plates was attained ; but it is to

be remembered, that little or no change is observable in the strength of the
plates, whilst that of the bars is increased nearly one-half.

    This fact is worthy of notice, inasmuch as in countries where the climate
is hot and never descends below freezing, the best bar iron will retain a
power of resistance equal to 29 tons upon the square inch, whereas in colder
and more northerly districts it would not be safe to calculate upon more
than 28 tons to the square inch.

to from twenty to twenty-five times its original length ; whilst plates, such
as we have selected, never come under the hammer, and seldom exceed six
or eight times the length of the original shingle after passing through the

rolls.

   On comparing these results with those of a similar quality of iron, viz.

^S.C. bar iron, experimented upon at Woolwich Dockyard, it will be found

that a corresponding and progressive increase of strength is equally appa-
rent as in the above experiments; that increase, however, arising from a

MERCANTILE STEAM TRANSPORT ECONOMY.  423

 Mercantile Steam Transport Economy. By Charles Atherton,

            Chief Engineer of Her Majesty's Dockyard, Woolwich.

    [A Communication directed to be printed entire among the Reports of the Association.]

 The construction of ships and the administration of shipping affairs, invol-

 ving a multiplicity of considerations of a scientific and of a practical and
 mercantile character connected with these arts, requires that shipping direc-

 tion be regarded and treated as the subject of an exclusive science; and, of
 late years, the progressively extended application of steam to maritime pur-
poses, and the prospect of its general use as an auxiliary power, have still
 further complicated the subject, and extended the range of mercantile

acquirement which is now necessary in the prosecution of steam-ship equip-
ment, direction, and management. It is therefore with diffidence, and with
the feeling of my not possessing the combination of qualifications which is
necessary to ensure adequate justice being done in all respects to the eluci-
dation of the important subject, " Steam Transport Economy," that I enter
upon the task of bringing that subject before the notice of the British Asso-
ciation for the Promotion of Science. I am, however, encouraged by the
assuring reflection that public utility is a field in which it is an honour to
labour, that lenient consideration for individual deficiencies and the helping
hand of others will be extended to the most humble delvers in that field, and
that credit may be earned in proportion to the roughness and obdurate nature
of the spot of ground which we may have undertaken to break up, and to
the perseverance by which one may at least attempt the accomplishment of

the assigned task. Permit me, therefore, to remark, that uiy present appeal

to the British Association is but a continuation of my previous efforts in the

cause of steam exposition, with a view to bringing " Steam Transport Eco-
nomy " within the pale of arithnietical calculation ; and as I shall have occa-
sion to refer to the enunciation of principles and to the details of calculations
which have thus preceded this essay, it may be convenient that I briefly
enumerate the various published statements thus referred to as forming an
integral portion of this paper, and which, accordingly, I beg to hand in to
the Association for the purposes of reference and record.

   A1st. brief essay on ' Marine Engine Construction and Classification,'

published by Weale, in 1851.
   The object of this essay was to analyse the data afforded by published and

authentic statements of the actual test-trial performances of various steam-
ships, and ascertain, by means of such comparative analysis, what are the
peculiarities or proportions of build, and what are the peculiarities of engine-
construction of those vessels which have attained to the highest degrees of

locomotive efficiency, thereby also scrutinising how far the popularly re-
ceived notions in regard to steam-ship type and marine engine construction,
supposed to be most conducive to locomotive efficiency, may be in accord-
ance with, or in opposition to, the results of actual experience, when mea-
sured by any definite and received law.

   2nd. An essay on ' Steam-ship Capability,' originally published in 1853,

and of which a second edition, with supplement, was published by Weale, in

1864..

   This essay was designed to demonstrate the mutual relations which subsist
between displacement, power, and speed in steam-ships ; especially as respects
the increasing scale of engine-power by which progressive increase of speed
is attained ; and to show the diflSculties which attend the prosecution of a
steam service in which long passages are required to be performed at a high
--424 REPORT 1856.

rate of speed ; also to show the sacrifice which attends the employment of
vessels of an inferior type of build, as compared with vessels of a superior
type. The supplement published with the second edition of this essay ex-
tended the tabular calculations to embiace vessels of hypothetical magni-
tude, and to demonstrate a system of Б s. d. arithmetical calculation appli-
cable to estimating the cost of goods conveyance per ton weight by steam-
ships, based on the constructive type of the ship, the speed to be realized,
and the size of ship employed to do the work. The appendix to this essay
embraces a dissertation on the probable capabilities of ships of unprece-
dented magnitude, showing the advantage of magnitude so far as mechanical
principles are concerned irrespective of mercantile considerations, and under

what combinations of speed and distance without re-coaling, comparatively

with the more frequent coaling depots available to smaller vessels, the me-

chanical advantage of magnitude becomes neutralized; also giving new tables

for facilitating steam-ship calculations, by showing the cubes of numbers

from 5 to 25, rising by the decimal "01 , and the cube-roots of the squares of

all numbers likely to be embraced in the tonnage displacement of ships.

A3i-d.   paper on " Steam-ship Capability," read before the Society of

Arts, London, 16th May, 1855.

The object of this paper was to expose the indefinite nature of the terms

" horse-power " and " tonnage " as respects their not being what tbey are

generally supposed to be, definite units of measurement of engine-power and
ships' size ; also to show the uselessness for scientific purposes of all statistical
data based on nominal horse-power and nominal tonnage, and the fallacy of
all calculations based on those indefinite terms, thence showing the necessity
for some definite measure of power being legalized as the unit of power to
be denoted by the term " Marine Horse-power," and used as the base of
calculation and contract engagement in steam shipping affairs.

  A4th. paper on " Tonnage Registration," read before the Society of Arts,

London, January 16, 1856, with the discussions thereon.
   The object of this paper was to show the insufficiency for scientific pur-

poses of the system of tonnage registration now in force, as prescribed by
the Merchant Shipping Bill of 1854, in so far that under this Act the
registered tonnage of a ship affords no certain indication of the tons weight

of cargo that the ship will carry, nor does it give, even approximately, the

displacement with reference to any given draught ; nor does the registration
afford any indication of the power capable of being worked up to by the
engines of steam-ships, or any other data whereby the dynamic properties or

locomotive duty of vessels may be scrutinized on scientific principles. By

this paper, I brought forward certain suggestions for public consideration

and discussion with a view to our official registration of shipping being ren-

dered more comprehensive for the fulfilment of the various useful purposes

to which statistical registration, if complete, would undoubtedly conduce, in

a scientific point of view, irrespectively of merely fiscal objects.

   These papers, oP 16th May 1855, and 16th of January 1856, urging the

establishment and recognition of definite units as the legal admeasurement of

marine engine-power and ships' tonnage, I beg respectfully to submit to the

notice of the Committee appointed by this Association for the consideration of
the tonnage question, of which Committee I had the honour of being named
a member, but I was under the necessity of declining to take part on this

Committee in consequence of my being, as above stated, committed to cer-

tain views and publicly engaged in agitating the question of Tonnage Regi-
stration amendment, with a view to supplying the deficiencies of the present

           MERCANTILE STEAM TRANSPORT ECONOMY.                              425

    Having thus shown that various investigations essentially connected with

the elucidation of the subject now before us, " Steam Transport Economy,"
have constantly and publicly engaged my attention since 1851, I may now,
in the beginning of my paper, announce the proposition to which I hope to

direct the attention of the British Association.

   Now, what I have undertaken to demonstrate is this : that, in consequence
of there being no legalized definitions of the terms power and tonnage as

standard units of quantity applied to the prosecution of steam navigation,

there is practically no definite measure of quantity whatever attaciied to

those terms, even although they are so generally made use of as the base of

pecuniary contracts, and that, in addition to the private evils as between

buyer and seller resulting from this singular anomaly in matters of mercan-

tile account: the public evils, resulting from nominal "horse-power" and

" tonnage " being terms which cannot be scientifically recognized as express-

ing either the working power of marine machinery or the size of a ship^ are

monstrous, inasmuch as they publicly defeat science from being brought to

bear on steam-ship construction and steam-ship management as a means of

investigation and proof whereby to confirm the existence and establish the

continued adoption of good practice where good practice does exist, and to

detect error either in the construction of steamers or in the management of

steamers in cases where bad types of construction and mal-administration

may exist and be destructive of enterprise, which might otherwise have con-

duced to public good. In short, ray object is to show that in consequence

of the deficiencies in our national standard units of power and tonnage, and

deficiencies of our statistical registration, the public are deprived of the

benefits capable of being derived from science as a means of discriminating

between good and bad practice in the great matter of shipping, thus enabling

us to take advantage of the one and explode the other. The constructive

merits of steam-ships in a dynamic point of view may be comparatively de-

termined by the ratio that subsists between the amount of displacement that

is propelled from place to place, the speed or time in which the vessel per-

forms the given passage, and the engine-power exerted or the coal consumed

in  the  performance  of  the work                                          yet every ship that is launched, and goes
                                                                         ;

with flying colours upon the usual test-trial, is always for the day pronounced

to be the most wonderful ship that ever was built ; and no wonder that it is

so, considering that the dynamic merits of ships are thus determined, not by

any admitted rule based on the mutual relations of displacement, power, and

speed, but by acclamation based on the mutual interests of all concerned,

that a new ship shall be of good repute. All attempts to expose this mon-

strous deficiency in our nautical system by urging the importance of statis-

tical registration, have been held up to reprobation as an interference with

the shipping interests, regardless of the fact that it is the public who pay the

penalty of an enhanced price of goods transport consequent on whatever

deficiencies may exist in connexion with the locomotive properties of our

shipping.

    In justification of these remarks as to our denominations of ships' tonnage

and engine-power being a delusion, subversive of all truth so far as scientific

inquiry and research may be based thereon, I may be permitted to adduce

the following statements :

    Ist. As to tonnage registration. Although tonnage measurement for re-

gistration has been subjected to legislative revision under the Merchant

Shipping Act of 1854, the terra "tonnage" is still made use of in various
significations. By the present law, 100 cubic feet of internal roomage, or

available space for cargo, constitutes the unit of tonnage, but as respects all
--436 REPORT 1856.

 ships built previously to the month of May 1855, when this Act came into

 operation, the adoption of this law is not compulsory. Merchants have the
 privilege of retaining the former registration of some ships, and getting such

 others of their ships measured and registered under the new Act as they may
 think fit to select for re-registry, so that the term " tonnage " may now signify
 " builders' tonnage," old measure, under the Act of 1773, or tonnage under
 the Act of 1833, or tonnage under the Act of 1854; and these are three

 totally different systems of admeasurement, having no definite ratio to each
 other. Moreover, the unit of tonnage under the Act of 1854) being based
 on internal roomage measurbig up to the deck, affords no certain indication
 of the displacement of a ship when loaded fit for sea, nor does it afford any

 assurance whatever as to the tons' weight of cargo that a ship will carry ; for

 example, by adopting the cellular principle of build now introduced in the

 construction of iron ships, a ship of 10,000 cubic feet of internal roomage, or
 100 tons register tonnage, may have such external displacement as would
safely float with the whole internal roomage filled with iron, and therefore

weighing no less than 1000 tons of dead weight, or ten times the register

tonnage, and the registration of steam-ships is open to similar delusion as to

their capability for weight of cargo. So much for the mercantile liberties
that may possibly be introduced and taken with our statistics of exports and
imports so far as they may be based on the tonnage registration of shipping

under the Act of 1854.
    The abortiveness for statistical and scientific purposes which has hitherto

attended all legislation on tonnage registration, appears to have been occa-
sioned by the attempt to embrace under the one term "tonnage," two things
which have no fixed ratio to each other, namely, tonnage by bulk, and ton-

nage by weight. The law has not comprehended the double mercantile use
and application of the term " ton " by providing for the separate and distinct
registration of each, namely, tonnage by bulk and tonnage by weight, the
capability of ships for holding bulk tonnage being dependent on internal room-
age ; but the capability of ships for carrying weight tonnage being dependent
on external displacement, a distinction which is not noticed by the new law
of tonnage admeasurement under the Act of 1854.

   2nd. As to marine engine-power. Although Watt originally defined the
unit of power, which he denominated horse-power, as equivalent to 33,000 lbs.
weight raised one foot high in one minute of time, and invented a mecha-
nical device or instrument called a "steam-indicator," whereby the variable
pressure of the steam in the cylinder and consequently the working power
of steam-engines could be readily ascertained (whence the working power so
ascertained was denominated the " indicated horse-power"), all which ar-
rangements of Watt put the working operation of the steam-engine originally
on a scientific base, defined by a standard unit of power admeasurement,
still this definite unit of power was never recognized by law, and conse-
quently the steam-engine was no sooner applied to maritime purposes, than
the rivalry of trade introduced a practice under which the nominal, or contract
power of engines, did not specifically regulate the working capability of the
engine delivered. Engines were not objected to by the purchaser if their
working capabilities were in excess of the nominal power, and engineers
themselves voluntarily supplied marine engines working up to an " indicated
power far in excess of the nominal " power, for the purpose of thereby dri-
ving the new vessel at a higher rate of speed than that attained by some rival
vessel with the same nominal power. Reputation for the production of fast
steamers depended on beating the rival boat, not on the mode of effectin-^

M\*that object, The shipping interests and their working craftsmen,
MERCANTILE STEAM TRANSPORT ECONOMY.  427

Wrights and engineers, felt themselves constrained to meet their rivals in
trade with their rivals' M'eapons ; numerous devices have been adopted with
a view to the development of power on board of ship by packing the greatest
amount of engine-power into the least space, and undoubtedly great improve-
ments have been made by adapting the dimensions and proportions of vessels
to the service required, but still " Fame," in regard to the character of steam-
ships based on speed, has been too much the result of horse-power delusive
jockeyship rather than of truthful science. By the practice of trade, horse-
power came to be measured by the diameter of the cylinder, without any
limitation as to the capabilities of the boiler, and gradually in time a marine-
engine contract was considered not to be fulfilled unless the engines were
capable of working up to an "indicated horse-power" at least double that of
the contract nominal power; still, however, no specific limit was assigned
either by custom or by law ; and at length to such a degree has competition
set truth at defiance, that the working, or " indicated horse-power " of
engines delivered under contract, has frequently amounted to four times the
nominal horse-power actually stipulated for by the contract. These facts

are fully set forth in the paper read by me before the Society of Arts on the
16th of May, 1855.

    Having thus pointed out the indefinite application in steam-shipping
practice of the terms " tonnage" and "horse-power," with reference to the
definite terms " displacement " and " indicated horse-power," it may be still
further edifying that we illustrate the anomalies liable to result when these
terms are used in combination with each other, as is constantly the case in
expressing and recording the ratio of tonnage to power of a steam-ship. In
exposition of this matter, I may again refer to the before-mentioned paper,
whereby it will be seen that I selected ten vessels, in each of which the ratio
of builders' tonnage to nominal power was very nearly the same, namely, in
the ratio of 100 tons of builders' tonnage to 40 nominal horse-power, or
2^ tons of tonnage to one nominal horse-power; but on comparing the
constructors' load displacement of these same ships, calculated in tons weight
at 35 cubic feet of water to the ton, with the effective working power, based on
indicator measurement, the ratio was found to be 100 tons displacement to
38 horse-power in one case, and 100 tons displacement to 281 horse-power

in another.

    The recorded statistics of these ten vessels would lead one to infer that
they are all powered in the same proportion of engine-power to size of ship ;
but, in fact, they are all different, and on comparing the two extremes, one
ship has no less than seven times the power of the other, in proportion to

size of ship as determined by displacement. In fact, generally, the records

of register-tonnage and nominal horse-power do not constitute statistical data
of any value whatever for the scientific purpose of discriminating between
the relative dynamic n orits of steam-ships, but, on the contrary, such records
and all ideas resulting therefrom are positively delusive and mischievous.
The conclusion at which 1 would arrive from these statements is, that the
very first step in any attempts to bring steam affairs within the range of
arithmetical calculation, must necessarily be to establish the measure or value
which we assign to our units of tonnage and power. It is only by the moral
influence of such a body as the British Association that the cause of science
can obtain a hearing in this matter of statistical registration applied to ship-
ping. With reference to our units, it is, of course, desirable that the measure
of the unit, to be legally recognized as the unit of power, should be nearly
in accordance with the general average of practice at the time when the unit

may be so established; and as at the present time (1856) the genФral run of
428 REPORT-- 1856.

marine nominal horse-power varies from two indicated horse-power to four
indicated horse-power, that is from 66,000 lbs. to 132,000 lbs. raised one foot
high per minute, it is submitted that tlie unit of marine horse-power would
now be most conveniently fixed at 100,000 lbs. raised one foot high per
minute. Until, however, some definite measure of the unit be legally
recognized, it is considered advisable in matters of scientific inquiry liiie the
present to adhere to the measure of the unit originally proposed by Watt,
namely, 33,000 lbs. raised one foot high per minute, designating this scale

--of measurement as the "indicated horse-power," thus: Ind. h.p. ; and such

will be the unit referred to when horse-power is spoken of in the following
pages of this paper.

   Now, as to the measure of the unit of tonnage by which the sizes of ships
are to be spoken of and compared, we have already observed that under the
Merchant Shipping Act passed in the year 1854-, the unit of tonnage is based
on the internal roomage of ships available for cargo ; that all ships built since

May 1855, are registered under this Act; but the re-measurement and

re-registration of ships built previously to 1855 is not made compulsory.
Shipowners have the privilege of re-registering, under the Act of 1854, such
vessels as they may select for that purpose; consequently, our present regis-
tration is mixed, and the various units of tonnage-measurement thus embraced
under our present tonnage-registration have no definite ratio to each other,
or to the tons weight of cargo that ships will carry. The comparative merits
or demerits of these various systems of registration for fiscal purposes need
not be here discussed. Suffice it to say, that in none of these systems has
any notice whatever been taken of the measurements which constitute dis-
placement ; and as displacement is an essential element in any scientific in-
vestigation as to the locomotive performance of steam-ships with reference
to the power employed and speed attained, it follows that our present regis-
tration of shipping, even under the Act of 1854, does not afford statistical
data of such a character as to be available for science in the matter of com-
paring the merits, in a locomotive or dynamic point of view, of the various
models or types of form by which steam-ships have been constructed. It is

submitted for the consideration of the British Association, that national ad-
vancement in maritime aft'airs, especially in regard to transport economy,
would be promoted by our public registration of shipping in general, and of
steam shipping in particular, being so systematized as to embrace not only
the roomage measurement required for fiscal purposes, but also, in addition,
those details of displacement, which in combination with the data of speed
and power derived from the actual performances of ships, are necessary to
scientific investigation in determining the relative dynamic merits of different
types of form of steam-ships. It must be borne in mind, that it is the public,

the consumers of merchandise, who must ultimately bear all the expenses

connected with the transport and delivery of merchandise, whether well or
ill performed. Bad ships individually enhance the average cost of imported
corn and all other consumable merchandise. Bad ships also enhance the
price of cotton and all other similar raw material imported for the production
of export manufactures. This enhanced price restricts demand, thus curtailing
the sources of employment ; so that every bad ship, whether employed in the
import or export trade, is, of itself, a public nuisance : a prevalent bad type
of ships would be a public calamity, and progressive improvement would be
a public benefit. It has been said that the interests of shipowners is in
itself a sufficient guarantee for ensuring the adoption of the type of ships
best adapted for mercantile steam transport economy. It is scarcely fair
to base any argument on interested motives, but as that argument has
MERCANTILE STEAM TRANSPORT ECONOMY.  429

been raised it must be noticed. Undoubtedly, each shipowner has an
individual interest in liis own sliips being the best afloat, but if he does
possess the best ships, it is equally his interest to keep that fact and the
means of acquiring them to himself, so that the charges for freight may con-
tinue to be ruled by the inferior dynamic qualities of the average ships em-

ployed by the trade, not by the superior dynamic qualities of the best ships
as possessed by himself, the difference being the shipowner's private advan-

tage or the public's loss. It is therefore the interest of the public that all
bad types of shipping be exposed and eradicated. Freight would then, as
respects the quality of ships, be ruled by a scale of charges derived from
the performance of a generally improved type of ships working in fair com-

petition with each other.

Having already defined the measurement of the units by which we propose

to designate the working power of the engines and the size of the ship,

namely, ind. h.p. at 33,000 lbs. raised one foot high per minute, and tons
weight of displacement at 35 cubic feet of water to the ton, it is now neces-

sary that we refer to the received law or formula by which the comparative

dynamic duty of steam-ships may be numerically ascertained. The formula

usually adopted for obtaining the coefficient of dynamic duty of steam-

-- =C DT--T--r
), in which is the displacement of the ship at the

Vtime of trial expressed in tons weight, the speed (usually expressed in

nautical miles per hour), and ind. h.p. the working power as ascertained by
means of the indicator. The resultant number (C) deduced from this formula
is termed the coetficient of dynamic performance. This coefficient (C) will
be a constant number for all vessels of perfectly similar model or type of
form, and of which the engines are equally effective in proportion to their gross
ind. h.p. ; but if the vessels be not of similar type, and the engines not equally
effective in proportion to their ind. h.p., the coefficient (C) will vary, and thus

the dynamic performance of different vessels will be comparatively ascertained.

It is not our purpose in this paper to raise any question as to the scientific
rationale or resultant accuracy of this formula ; I will merely observe, that
though open to criticism in several respects, the results of experience have
demonstrated that this formula, when applied to any known type of ship, ex-
pounds the mutual relations of displacement, power, and speed with a degree
of precision that admits of its being practically made use of for determining
the resultant speed that is to be expected from any combination of power
and displacement, and in like manner, any one of the three elements of the

formula may be deduced from the other two being given. Further, this
formula may be rendered available as a counting-house check on the work-

ing operation of steam-ships, simply by substituting the consumption of coals,
expressed in cwts. per day of 24 hours (W), in lieu of the ind. h.p.; for 1
cwt., or 112 lbs., per day of 24 hours is at the rate of 4"66 lbs. per hour,
which is probably about the ordinary consumption per ind. h.p. per hour,

and it ought not to be exceeded. If, therefore, in lieu of the ind. h.p. we

substitute the consumption of coals, calculated in cwts. per day of 24 hours,
the resultant coefficient (C) will afford an approximate indication of the
good or bad performance of ships, as compared one with another, and the
fact of an inferior performance being thus detected, the cause to which it

may be attributable, whether to inferior type of form, or foulness of bottom,

or inferior adaptation of engine, or inferior construction of boiler, or inferior

management on board ship, will then become the subject of professional in-
quiry ; thus, the merchant, by aid of his counting-house statistics of displace-
ment, time on passage of given length, and coals consumed, will be enabled
--430 REPORT 1856.

to detect the fact of ineflSciency, and it will then be for the professional
engineer to detect and remedy the cause thereof. The annunciation of the

--formula, or the mercantile rule above referred to, is as follows : Multiply

the cube of the speed, expressed in knots or nautical miles per hour (V^),

by the cube root of the square of the displacement (Df ), and divide by the

consumption of coals, expressed in cwts. per day of 24 hours, the resultant
numeral coefficient (C) will indicate the dynamic or locomotive efficiency
of the vessel ; and such is the variable condition of steam-ships in present
use, that the coefficient has been found to be as low in some cases as 120,
whilst in other cases it has reached the number 250. The pecuniary value
of gold is determined by assay ; and in like manner the contract price to be
paid for a steam-ship should, in some measure, be regulated by the coefficient,
based on the mutual relation of displacement, speed, and coals, which may
be realized on trial of the ship ; for example, multiply the contract price by
the numeral coefficient that may be actually realized, and divide by the
coefficient that may be regarded as the par measure of dynamic efficiency,

according as the vessels maybe painted or sheathed with copper. Contracts
based on this principle would constitute a check upon the production of
inefficient ships, and award a premium on the construction of ships of superior

merit.

-- -- --The approximate trustworthiness of the formula (^~j j~  ^1 being

conceded, we now have the means of pursuing our exposition of the extent

to which any definite diflference of type or falling off in the working condition

of a ship will affect the amount of prime cost expenses incurred in the con-

veyance of merchandise by steam-ships. Suppose, for example, that we

have ships whose coefficients of dynamic duty or index numbers (C) deduced

                   -- =C^  j are respectively 250 and 166, which num-

from the formula f . . .

bers correspond with 1000 and 664, if the unit of marine engine-power be

taken at 4 ind. h.p., as is the case in the tabular calculations given in Ather-
ton's ' Steam-ship Capability,' and are coefficients of dynamic duty not

unusual as between different steam-ships in actual practice ; in evidence of
which, confirmatory of the official records whence L ..se numbers are taken,

I may refer to a tabular statement of steam-ship trials recently supplied to
me by one of our most experienced firms (engineers and shipbuilders), by
which statement it appears, that, adopting the formula referred to, the index
numbers or coefficients of dynamic duty of eight steam-ships varied from 251
to 149, thus showing that the difference of constructive types now assumed

as the base of calculation for this exposition, is not an exaggeration, but such

as is common in practice. In the first place, referring to ' Steam-ship Capa-
bility,' 2nd edit, page 78, we will expose the difference of power (ind. h.p.)

Awhich would be required by two vessels. and B, of the respective types

or working conditions of service indicated by the coefficients above referred
to (namely 250 and 166), supposing the vessels to be each of 2500 tons load

Adisplacement. The vessel will be propelled at 8 knots, 10 knots, and 12

knots per hour, by 376 ind. h.p., 736 ind.h.p., and 1272 ind. h.p, ; but the vessel

B will require, to attain the same rate of speed, 568 ind, h.p,, 1112 ind.h.p.,
and 1920 ind. h.p. Thus the ship B requires, in consequence of her infe-

riority of working condition, or type of construction, an increase of power of

Ano less than 50 per cent, in order to attain the same rate of speed as ship ;

and, be it observed, that these assumed coefficients are within the range of

ordinary difference between one ship and another.

   We will now show the sacrifice which such a difference of type produces
MERCANTILE STEAM TRANSPORT ECONOMY.  431

in the weight of cargo which these ships of (say) 2500 tons displacement,

with mean quantity of coal on board, would respectively carry on a given

passage, if powered for running at the speed of 8, 10, and 12 knots per hour.

For this exposition we will assume the weight of the ships themselves, as

measured by the light displacement of ships, when ready to receive cargo and

coal for the voyage, to appropriate 1000 tons displacement, being 40 per

Wecent, of the load displacement.  will also assume the weight of the

engine department complete at 5 cwts. per ind. h. p., and the consumption of

coal to be at the rate of 4 lbs. per ind. h.p. per hour, and the length of passage,

without re-coaling, to be 3250 nautical miles, being about the distance from

Liverpool to New York, or to Constantinople. On these data, according as

the vessels may be powered, as before shown, for being propelled at the speed

Aof 8, 10, and 12 knots per hour, the displacement available for cargo in

will be 1270 tons, 1103 tons, and 875 tons weight of cargo ; while in B it will

Abe 1152, 900, and 556 tons weight. The consumption of coal in will be

273 tons at 8 knots, 427 tons at 10 knots, and 615 tons at 12 knots ; and in

B it will be 412, 64^5, and 929 tons weight. Hence it appears that purely in

consequence of the difference in constructive type, or working condition of

the ships, the reduction of cargo in B, as compared with A, will be 9, 18, and
36 per cent., according as the speed may be, 8, 10, or 12 knots per hour;

while the increase of coal, being in proportion to the increase of power, will

in each case be 50 per cent. But the public evils of an inferior type, or

neglected condition of ships, will be still more fully exposed, and be more

definitely understood by the extra Б s. d. charge that must be made for

freight per ton weight of goods conveyed, in order to meet the prime cost

expense of conveyance. In order to work out this calculation, we must

assume certain data of investment and current expense as constituting the

prime cost charges of permanently establishing and upholding a commercial

fleet of steam-ships ; and as this is the vital point in which the public, as con-

sumers, have a direct interest, it will be expected that I enter upon it in con-

siderable detail, as set forth in Supplement to ' Steam-ship Capability,' 2nd

edit, page 76.

In the first place, I would remark that it is only during the number of days

that steamers are annually at sea conveying cargoes of goods from port to

port that they earn the income that is to defray the whole annual expenditure

incurred. The number of days per annum during which steamers are at sea

will, of course, depend materially on the service in which they may be

employed ; and as it is proposed to work out our calculations with reference

--to a passage of 3250 nautical miles- such, for example, as the passage from

--England to New York or to the Black Sea I have assumed that the vessels

employed on such service may be at sea 200 days per annum. In the next

place, the cost of coal is a very material item, greatly dependent on the

service on which the vessels may be employed. This I have assumed at Б2

per ton weight as the average cost of the yearly consumption. Next, as to

the ship ; I have assumed that a ship of 2500 to 3000 tons load displacement

would be purchased from the builders as a ship of about the same amount of

tonnage, builders' measurement, and that the cost of the ship, completely

fitted, equipped, and furnished in all respects ready for sea, would be Б25 per

ton. Then, assuming the interest on investment at Б5 per cent, per annum,

the upholding and replacement at lOper cent, per annum, insurance at 5 per

cent, per annum, and wages and rations of officers and crew all the year

round at Б3 per 100 tons per week ; on these data we shall have the prime

cost expenses incidental to the hull amounting to Б6 \\s.2d. per ton of

tonnage per annum, which is Sd. per day sea-time, assuming the vessel to be
----                                                                 --

--432 REPORT 1856.

at sea 200 days per annum, exclusive of harbour dues, lights, and pilotage,
which are supposed to be the same for all ships of equal tonnage.

    Next, as to the engine department :

   The average price of marine condensing engines, as now usually con-
structed, may be rated at Б50 per nominal horse-power, and in general each
horse-power nominal may be expected to work up to 2|- ind. h.p., so that the
cost of marine engines may be rated at Б20 per ind. h.p. Then, assuming the
interest on investment at 5 per cent, per annum on the contract cost, the
ujiholding and replacement at 10 per cent., insurance 5 per cent., wages and
rations of engineers and stokers at Б5 per 100 ind. h.p. per week, consu-
mable stores (coal excepted) Б2 lOs. per iOO ind. h.p. per week, on these data
we shall have the prime cost expenses incidental to the engine department
(exclusive of coal), amounting to Б7 185. per ind. h.p. per annum, which is
9d. per day per ind. h.p. sea-time, assuming the vessel to be at sea 200 days

per annum.

These assumed data of pecuniary charges incidental to steam-ship transport

service, as applied to mercantile purposes, combined with the mutual relations

of displacement, power, and speed, which are derivable from the foregoing

         =/ V^ D^           \

formula \( m: d.t-h.~p~.  C l according to the constructive type or locomotive

                            /

{pality of the ship, as shown by the coefficient or index number C, enable us
to make up the prime cost expenses, being the minimum at which goods can

be conveyed, and which therefore should constitute the base of the estimate

by which a minimum scale of freight charges should be estimated ; and

Aapplying these data to the ships and B, employed on a passage of 3250

nautical miles, as exemplified in the Supplement to Atherton's ' Steam-ship
Capability,' 2nd edition, page 78, the minimum scale of freight charges per

ton of goods, according as the vessels may be powered for a speed of 8, 10,

or 12 knots per hour, will, on the data referred to, require to be as follows :

ShipA                         8 knots.     10 knots.      12 knots.
ShipB
                          272Б1 15 7    Б2394 86      Б3 4-6

                                                        6 16 3

   The proportions in which goods, according to their respective kinds, may
be made to bear freight charges so as to yield the average return per ton

weight on the entire cargo, is altogether a matter of commercial discretion
and management. The entire cargo must be made to yield the average return

per ton weight here set forth.

   Hence it appears that 12 miles speed involves about double the freight cost
of the 8 miles speed with the superior ship A, and nearly three times the cost

of the 8 miles speed with the ship B, and 12 miles speed with the ship B is

about four times as expensive as the 8 miles speed with the ship A. Also,
the extra cost to the public at which freight charges are enhanced by the in-
ferior type or inferior working condition of ship B, as compared with the ship
A, if continuously employed on the passage of 3250 nautical miles, and under
the data referred to, assuming the consumption of coal to be at the rate of
4 lbs. per ind. h.p. per hour, and according as the steaming speed of both
ships may be 8, 10, or 12 knots per hour, is no less than 32 per cent, at
8 knots, 56 per cent, at 10 knots, and 111 per cent, at 12 knots. Undoubt-
edly, the details of the data on which the foregoing calculations have been
based are open to correction, and will greatly depend on their application to
special services on considerations immediately connected with such special
service, and cannot be generalized ; but, whatever alteration of these data

Amay be applied to the ship must likewise be applied to B, so that, although
             MERCANTILE STEAM TRANSPORT ECONOMY.      433

the foregoing estimate of the actual cost expenses of freight may be consider-

ably modified by our altering the data of the calculations, still the per-

centages of difference above set forth, showing the degree or per-centage in

which freight charges for the passage of 3250 miles are enhanced in conse-

quence of the inferiority in locomotive properties of the ship B, as compared

with the ship A, will not be much altered from the per-centages above set

forth, showing an enhanced cost of freight to be paid by the public on bring-

ing cargo, grain forinstance,from the States, or from the Black Sea, to England,

amounting to 32 percent. at the 8 knots speed, b(^ percent. at the lOknots speed,

and 111 per cent, at the 12 knots speed, extra charges incurred on freight per

ton of goods conveyed, and to be paid by the public, in consequence of the

dynamic inferiority of ship B, as compared with ship A. It is surely in con-

sequence of the public not being generally aware of the high scale of prime

cost charges necessarily involved in a 12 miles speed (steaming speed at sea),

as compared with an 8 miles speed, that such high speed is so universally de-

manded by the public ; and it must surely be in consequence of an almost
similar want of insight into the real cost of high speed on the part of directors,

that obligations as to speed are so frequently incurred at a price inadequate

to such service. If the public will have a progressively increasing high rate of

speed, they must pay for it about in the ratio at which they purchase iron,

copper, silver, gold, and diamonds, either of which may be bought too dear for

common use.

   The foregoing results have been based on the supposition that the consump-

Mytion of fuel in both ships is at the rate of 4 lbs. per hour per ind. h.p.

own experience, however, induces me to be of opinion that this rate of con-

sumption is but very seldom realized, and that 5 lbs. of coal per ind. h.p.

per hour is much nearer in accordance with our present actual steaming prac-

tice. It is therefore important that we show to what extent the rate of trans-

port freight expenses will be enhanced, if the service above referred to,

namely 3250 nautical miles direct, be performed with an inferior construc-

tion of boiler, causing a consumption of 5 lbs. of coal per indicated horse-

power per hour, instead of 4- lbs., as above calculated on. In this case, accord-

ing as the speed for which the vessel may be powered is *8, 10, or 12 knots

an hour (see ' Steam-ship Capability,' p. 78), the cost expenses incurred by
vessel A, instead of being Б1 Б2155. Id.., ^s. 6d., and Б3 4*. 6d, per ton-weight

of cargo, will now amount to Б1 195. 5d., Б2 lis. 4</., and Б3 19*. Id. per

ton-vfeight of cargo, this increase of prime cost freight expenses per ton of

goods being 11 per cent., 15 per cent., and 22 per cent., according as the

service speed may be 8, 10, or 12 knots per hour, solely in consequence of the

inferiority of the boiler, or inferiority of boiler-management, causing this

extra consumption of fuel ; and further, if this greater consumption of coal

be combined with the inferior type of vessel B, the prime cost expenses of

freight per ton of goods, instead of being Б115*. 7c?., Б2 4s. 6c?., and Б3 4s. 6c?.,

will now be Б2 13s. 7c?., Б4 5s. 5d., and Б9 15s. 2d., this increase of freight

cost being 18s. per ton, Б2 Os. lie?, per ton, and Б6 10s. 8d. per ton weight

of cargo conveyed, or 50 per cent., 100 per cent., and 202 per cent, extra

charge incurred according as the service speed may be 8, 10, or 12 knots per

hour. These results show the monstrous extent, in a pecuniary point of

view, to which the public are interested in the general quality of the type of

ships and machinery adaptation thereto, and working condition of ships by
which the mercantile transport service of the country may be prosecuted.

But let us look a little further into this matter, in the hope of obtaining

a more definite appreciation of the total extent in Б s. d. to which the

British public are interested in having their mercantile transport service per-

formed to the best advantage. It has been publicly stated (' Times,* June 18,
1856) that at the twelve principal ports of the United Kingdom during the
year 1855, ship tonnage to the extent of 6,372,301 tons entered inwards, and
6,426,566 tons cleared outwards, making altogether 12,798,867, say 12|-
millions of tons of tonnage per annum ; and since mercantile shipping will
probably, on the average, carry dead weight of cargo to the full extent of
their register tonnage, it is probable that the tons weight of merchandise con-
stituting the cargoes of ships arriving at and sailing from the United King-
dom, amounts to no less than twelve millions of tons per annum, of which,
for the purpose of illustration, we will suppose that one-sixth part, or two
millions of tons, is conveyed by steam power on a passage of 3250 nautical
miles, under the circumstances of the data that have been assumed as the base
of the foregoing calculations; and since we have shown under these circum-
stances that the prime cost expenses of freight per ton of goods may be
enhanced by an inferior type of ship and machinery, or inferior management
thereof, to the extent of I8s., Б2 0*. lie?., and Б6 10s. Sd. per ton weight of
goods conveyed, it follows that the extra charges for freight on the assumed
quantity of two millions of tons weight per annum, will amount to the extra
annual cost or public loss of Б1,800,000 at 8 knots speed, Б4',916,666 at 10
knots speed, and Б13,666,666 at 12 knots speed, according as the type of ship
and machinery by which the work is performed may be of the inferior type

AB, as compared with the superior type ; seeing also that it is the public

interest which has to bear the brunt of our national goods transport service,
being either as respects construction or working condition anything short of
that degree of perfection which the application of science might achieve, is it
not, therefore, of importance that our public system of statistical shipping
registration should be complete, especially in those points which are essential
for scrutinising the dynamic properties of steam-ships, thus leading to the
recognition of good practice on the one hand, or the exposition of bad practice
and consequent public loss on the other ? Ships may be regarded as national
implements for doing the work of the nation, and should therefore be sub-
jected, by the aid of statistical registration, to public scrutiny, as conducive

to their being upheld fit to do their work in the best manner. A shipbuilder

will not allow his interests to be trifled with by the use of a blunt adze, so
the public interest requires that its national transport service in the convey-
ance of goods should not be performed by bad ships if the statistical grind-
stone will obviate the evil. Nevertheless, the public statistics of British ship-
ping afford no data available to science for promoting or even protecting
from abuse the great public interests which are involved in the proper execu-
tion of its transport service, amounting probably to twelve millions of tons
per annum. It is pre-eminently for the British Association to suggest the
remedy for this humiliating fact.

   The subject herein treated of admits of extended illustration beyond the
limits of time that I may presume to occupy at a meeting of the British
Association. I only profess to have broken up new ground, in showing that
mercantile transport service by steam-ships admits of being brought within
the range of arithmetical calculation, whereby the dynamic quality of ships,
the size of ships as measured by displacement, the working quality of engines
and engine-power as measured by the unit ind. h.p., and the speed to be
assigned as the condition of any service, may each of them be treated as

functions of calculation involving definite pecuniary considerations, consti-

tuting a system wliich may be denominated the "arithmetic of steam-ship

'adaptation to the requirements of mercantile service." By the application of

these principles of calculation, I submit that errors in steam-ship construction,
             MERCANTILE STEAM TRANSPORT ECONOMY.                                   435

or neglect of its working condition, may be exposed, correction will follow,
the directorial management of steam-shipping affairs, as respects steam-ship
capability, will be based upon arithmetical calculation, thereby prosecuting

its assigned service with confidence, and rejecting all Utopian projects that
will not pay. Thus science will produce its fruit in promoting public in-
terests, without detriment to the fair competitive pursuits of any class, by pro-
ducing a sound, well-understood, and healthy condition of steam- ship manage-
ment, and consequently of " Mercantile Steam Transport Economy."

Remarks by James R. Napier, Glasgow, on Mr. Atherton's Paper on Mer-
                               cantile Steam Transport Economy,

I quite agree with Mr. Atherton in regard to the indefiniteness of the

term horse-power as at present used in steam-engine contracts, and in the

desirableness of having a dynamical unit, or standard of power or work

legalized, as well for the purpose of buying and selling machines produ-

cing power, as for that of scientific comparison. The rule or formula

established by James Watt for the horse-power of condensing engines was

PXV          ~foot lbs. per minute  ,             wh, ere  t,he  pressure  (^P^)^           ,

SSmo^^                              horse-power,                                   and

             33 000

velocity (V) had either their ac<?^a^ values or fractional parts thereof. But

at the present time the pressure (P) is continued at what it was in the days

of Watt, viz. 7 lbs., no matter what the actual pressure may be now. And

for the velocity (V) almost every engineer has a scale of his own, varying

according to the length of stroke of the steam-piston ; some assuming the

Vvelocities to vary as (of the length of stroke), others following the Admi-

ralty rule for paddle engines assuming the velocities to vary as \/ (of the

length of stroke). All these assumptions, moreover, have no necessary con-

nexion with the results desired, nor with the actual results afterward obtained ;
nor do they answer any better the purpose either of the buyer or seller ; and
all the use they subserve is to fix the size of the cylinder by the very round-
about method of resolving an arithmetical or algebraical equation in which
two of the three quantities, diameter, length of stroke or velocity, and horse-

power required to be known.
   As the term horse-power applied to steam-engines was fixed by Watt at

33,000 lbs. raised 1 foot high per minute, and as this same value is used by
the Americans, the French, the Germans, and, I presume, by all nations

where the history of the steam-engine is known, I should be very sorry to
recommend any change as to the use of the name in any other sense than as
synonymous with 33,000 lbs. per minute. I see no objection, however, to
the entire abolition of the term Nominal Horse-Power, as it is of no use
whatever to the engineer, as little to steam-engine owners, and deceitful to

the public.

   As I adhere to 33,000 lbs. per minute being received as a horse-power, I
would object to the 33,000 being altered into 132,000, or into any other
figure, without at the same time changing the name into something alto-
gether different from Horse-Power or Marine Horse-power. I would sug-
gest that the power be expressed in foot lbs. alone, as this is a term already
known to all scientific nations. Dividing by 1,000,000, the result would be

simply stated in millions of foot lbs.

   As to the tonnage question, I feel I know very little about it, except that
the present law is very complex, and certeunly does not give what Mr.

Atherton would like, viz. the displacement.

That part of Mr. Atherton's paper concerning the comparison of vessels

                                                            2f2
                                  --

is very important. What other writers have called the efficiency or the ratio

of the power expended to the work produced, is surely a subject which all

shipowners ought to be acquainted with. The formula adopted by Mr.

Atherton for the efficiency or dynamical duty of steam-ships, is, I fear, too

rough an approximation to be recommended for general adoption, especially

when a more exact and equally simple formula is at hand, and the one also

from which Mr. Atherton's adopted formula is no doubt deduced, viz.

^=L.V^x mid. section  ,,,  power  .       . .,                       ,  x,          ,p

at present varies as the cube of the velocity. This, I believe, is nearly true,
and ought to vary also directly as the immersed midship section. For simi-
lar vessels the midship section no doubt varies as displacement raised to
the power ^rds ; but scarcely any two vessels are similar (in the mathema-
tical sense of the term) ; nor is the same vessel similar to itself when the draft

of water varies.

   The following Table, deduced from published statements of some of the
ships of the Navy, and also from vessels built by the firm with which I am
connected, shows the difficulty there would be in the use of the formula
V^ (displacement) f=C, from the (displacement) f having no necessary

connexion with the midship section :

                                                                                                                                  2

In reference to the Table of the performances of steamers, which I recently

gave to Mr. Atherton, it is necessary to remark that too much confidence is

not to be placed in it as an exact document. Though I aimed at the truth,
it is possible I may have erred in the speed which is generally on the Clyde

tried between the Clock and Cumbrae lighthouses, or 13f nautical miles
too great a distance for maintaining a uniform speed, especially in new ves-

sels with strange firemen, &c. I believe the statement, however, to be nearly

true, and the study of it affords useful lessons. The last column shows the

efficiency of the vessels by both formulas; I adhere, however, to the mid-

section formula, as being the more correct.

   The * Vulcan's ' speed and power is deduced from a number of trials at a
measured statute mile on the Garelock. The ' Simoom s ' performances I

obtained from one of the Dockyards.

   The ' Bogota,' a common paddle-wheel steamer employed by the Pacific
Steam Navigation Company, and loaded very deeply at her trial, shows a

very inferior result to that of the screw-steamer 'Black Swan' (now 'Ganges'),

not deeply laden. Their displacements are nearly alike, and their speeds

about equal                                             yet the paddle vessel (too deeply laden) requires about 60 per
                                                     ;

cent, more power than the screw.

The ' London ' and ' Lady Eglinton ' are two screw vessels near enough

alike to be comparable. Their screws are the same diameter, but the one is
more immersed than the other, which I imagine is sufficient to account for

at least part of the difference in the efficiency of the two vessels.
   The ' Edina ' was constructed by Messrs. Barclay and Curie, and her

engines by Inglis ; but I was kindly invited to the trial, and got the particu-

lars of displacement, power, and midship section from the constructors. The

trials of the screw -steamer ' Lancefield ' are not so satisfactory as could be

desired, there being a little uncertainty as to speed. At the first trial the
screw was not immersed : the result shows a very low coefficient. The speed

at the other trials is uncertain, as it was taken at sea, and not in the usual
way for such calculations.

I was unfortunate in not getting the particulars of the power and speed of

the ' Persia ' before she left the Clyde, so as to add her performances to the

Table.

--Sir, With reference to Mr. James R. Napier's remarks on my paper,

" Mercantile Steam Transport Economy," I beg to submit the following ob-

servations. Mr. J. R. Napier concurs with me as to the indefiniteness of the

term "nominal horse-power," as at present applied in marine engineering

practice, and in the desirableness of having the unit of power, denoted horse-

power,  specifically defined                                                                    and he prefers  that  the  measure  originally pro-
                                                                                             ;

posed and acted upon by Watt, viz. 33,000 lbs. weight raised 1 foot high

per minute, be now adopted as the statute unit of horse-power.

On this point I have merely to remark, that scientifically it is a matter of

indifference what may be the statute measure of the unit, provided it be
specific. In my ' Essay on Steam-ship Capability,' I based my calculations

and tables on 132,000 lbs. raised 1 foot high per minute, because that was the

average performance, per nominal horse-power, of the ten mail packets then

employed in Her Majesty's Service. In my paper on " Mercantile Steam

Transport Economy," I have suggested that 100,000 lbs., raised 1 foot high

per minute, be adopted as the statute unit of horse-power, because that is, I
--

believe, about the average present practice in the highest class of our mer-

chant steam-shipping, and this measure of the unit would facilitate calcula-

tions; but whether 33,000, or 100,000, or 132,000, or any other number of

lbs. weight, raised 1 foot high per minute, be adopted as the statute unit of

horse-power, is a mere matter of convenience, a question very proper for

being submitted for the consideration and recommendation of a Committee.
----V^D^As to the question whether tiie formula

be the better formula for determining the relative dynamic merits of steam-

ships, these formulae are, as respects similar types of immersed form, a mere

transformation of terms, for in similar types of form the immersed midship

section will vary in the same proportion as the cube root of the square of the

displacement. These formulae would therefore give proportional results. I

                                                  V/ D^ \

--have, however, preferred the formula based on displacement I -^--z r-^-- i,

because this formula may, as I believe, be made the base of calculations as
to the capability of ships for mercantile service, for which purpose the for-
mula, based on midship section, without reference to displacement, is

inadequate.

   The Table of data now supplied by Mr. J. R. Napier, is a valuable addition

to our statistical data, in so far that, after having determined the relative
dynamic merits of the ships referred to, and classified them accordingly, the
information afforded by this Table will aid in the analysis of their respective
types of form. T would, however, beg to suggest that the position of the
centre of gravity of the immersed midship section of each ship, expressed by
its depth below the surface line, at which the displacement has been cal-
culated, would be a very important addition to this Table, and it is hoped that

Mr, James R. Napier will be able to supply it.
    In fact, it is in consequence of the depth of the centre of gravity not being

noticed in the formula above referred to, that I have spoken of it in my

paper as " open to criticism " and probable amendment, and I shall be pre-
pared in Committee to submit this view of the case for consideration.
Requesting that this letter be read conjointly with Mr. Napier's remarks,

                I have the honour to be. Sir, your most obedient servant,

                                                                     Charles Atherton.

                     On the Vital Powers of the Spongiadoe.
                By J. S. BowERBANK, F.E.S., F.G.S. ^c.

                                   Inhalation and Exhalation.

Some years since I received from Dr. Lister of Madeira two masses of a

Halichondriaceous sponge, each about 7 inches in diameter, accompanied
by the information that they were portions of the same individual, and I
was struck by the remarkable difference in the external appearance of the
two. In one, the oscula were nearly all widely expanded, several of
the orifices being nearly half an inch in diameter; while in the other
piece scarcely any of them were open, the greater part being entirely closed
by a stout membranous veil, which in many cases was pursed up in the

centre of the area in a conical form. On writing to my friend to inquire

the cause of this difference in the appearance of the two pieces of the

same sponge, he informed me that the piece with the closed oscula had been
ON THE VITAL POWERS OP THE SPONGIAD^.  439

 dried immediately on being taken from the sea, but that the other one had
 been placed in a vessel of sea-water, about half an hour after removal from
 the sea, and placed in the sun ; nearly all the orifices were then closed,
 and it was observed by Dr. and Mrs. Lister ths.t a gradual contraction shortly
 commenced in the membranous veils of the oscula, which continued until the
 whole of the orifices were opened to the fullest extent, and in this condition
 they remained. Struck by this explanation and by some other circumstances
 of a similar nature which I had observed in other sponges, I felt a strong
 conviction that the Spongiadse possessed the power of" expanding and con-
 tracting the oscula at their pleasure while in a living condition, and I deter-
 mined at the first convenient opportunity to work out this interesting problem
 in their natural history. I accordingly located myself at Tenby, South

Wales, at the latter end of last May for the purpose.
    The great cave that runs completely through beneath St. Catherine's

Island at Tenby, is highly favourable to such observations as I contemplated
making, as it is studded abundantly in every direction with specimens of
Halichondria panicea and Grantia compressa, Johnston, and a deep orange-

coloured sponge, Hymeniacidon carunciila, Bowerbank, MS. On my first

visit to the cave, June 2nd, I carefully noted the appearance of Halichondria
panicea and Hymeniacidon caruncula in the condition of repose during the
period of low tide, while they were without water and fully exposed to the
influence of the atmosphere. 1 found that in Hal. panicea the greater
portions of the oscula were completely open, while the tubular orifices of

others were either partially or completely closed. On the contrary, in fifty or

sixty specimens of Hymeniacidon caruncula they were so completely closed
that I could scarcely detect even their position on the surface of the sponge.
I carefully removed several specimens of each species from the rocks to
which they adhered, taking care not to injure the basal membranes of the
sponges. I placed them in shallow dishes of fresh salt water, and in a short
time the whole of them began to pour forth streams of water from their
oscula with considerable force. I supplied these specimens with indigo
rubbed up into a fine powder and infused in salt water ; the rush of the par-
ticles to the outer surface of Halichondria panicea and Grantia compressa
rendered them of a deep blue colour in a short time, and the ex-current
streams continued steadily in action for more than an hour. I then poured
oflP the water, that they might reniaia for some hours in the same condition as
the specimens were in their natural locality ; at 8 o'clock in the evening
I filled up the dishes with fresh salt water, and in a very short time the ex-
current action commenced ; and I left it in full action in two specimens of

Halichondria panicea at 11 p.m. On examining these specimens at 10 a.m.

on the 3rd of June, I found that nearly the whole of the oscula, which were
fully distended on the previous evening, were now nearly all closed ; and
the mode of closing was in some cases rather peculiar ; the greatest con-
traction was at about half a line within the outer edge of the osculum, and

by this constriction the closing wБis completely effected, leaving the outer
part of the osculum above this constriction in the form of a shallow cup,
slightly elevated above the general level of the surface of the sponge.

   Of three specimens of Hymeniandon caruncula placed by themselves in a

saucer of sea-water, not a single osculum was apparent at 11 p.m. on the
previous night ; but on the following morning, June 3, at 9 a.m., several oscula
in each specimen were to be seen in a full state of expansion, varying in size
from one to four lines in diameter, and the ex-current streams were steadily

poured forth.
   The surface of the sponges exhibited a comparatiTely smooth and dilated
--440 REPORT 1856.

appearance, and the inhalant pores were distinctly visible by the aid of a
2-inch lens. I removed these specimens from the water and placed them in
a saucer; in tlie course of a few minutes the surface of the sponges lost the
smooth distended appearance, the pores were scarcely distinguishable by the
aid of the same lens, and the surface became full of corrugations. The
oscula gradually contracted at about a line or half a line within the outer
margin, and this slow contraction continued in action until the openings were
completely closed, and a cup-shaped depression only remained to indicate
the large orifices which but 10 or 15 minutes previously were steadily pouring
forth the ex-current streams. The thin sharp membranous edges of the
osculum shrunk into a fleshy obtuse margin to the basin-shaped depression
of these organs in their closed state.

    I let them remain without water from half-past 9 o'clock in the morn-
ing until half-past 1 p.m., and then replaced them in the saucer with
a few fronds of green fuci, and gave them fresh sea-water. In 5 or 6
minutes there was a manifest expansion of the oscula, and they continued
gradually to open ; the obtuse margins became thin, sharp, and slightly pro-
jecting, and the currents were poured forth vigorously and continuously
from each osculum. I triturated a little crude indigo in sea-water, and let
it glide from the small palette knife over those portions of the sponges where
there were no oscula ; the molecules of indigo were immediately drawn
forcibly down to the surface, and were retained there. I then dropped in a
similar manner a few drops of the water laden Avith indigo, immediately
over the oscula ; a few molecules remained very close to the margin of the
osculum, but the remainder were driven off by the powerful jet of water
issuing from the osculum, and were speedily dispersed and mixed with the
surrounding fluid. By these experiments the in-current and ex-current actions
were rendered strikingly apparent, and it was evident that even in the imme-
diate vicinity of the oscula the in- current action was in full operation. At
a quarter past 3 o'clock the ex-current action had entirely ceased in one
of the four specimens, and was very languidly continued in the others, but
the oscula were still fully expanded ; before an hour had elapsed, the ex-
current action had apparently ceased in all the specimens ; the smaller oscula
were closed, but the larger ones were contracted to the extent of about half
their greatest amount of expansion. I drained the water from these sponges
at half-past 11 p.m., and at 10 o'clock the next morning, June 4, I filled up
the saucer with fresh sea-water, but I did not detect them in action during
the remainder of the day. At half-past ] 1 of the 4th the water was again
drained from them.

  --June 5th. At aquarter past9 a.m. I put fresh water to the same group of

Hal. caruncula ; about five minutes after the oscula were slowly opened, and
the ejection of the water from one of the small oscula near the middle part
of the largest sponge, commenced at first slowly, and then, after the lapse
of a iew minutes, with such force as to produce a continued elevation of the
surface of the water immediately above it, about a i or f of an inch above
the osculum. During this action of the smaller and more simple osculum
near the middle of the sponge, two large compound oscula, each consisting
of three or four orifices, situated in depressions near each end of the sponge,
were languidly pouring forth streams of water. Three quarters of an hour
after the commencement of the projection of the ex-current streams they
became still more languid in their action, and at the end of an hour they
entirely ceased ; the oscula in each of the groups near the ends of the sponge
were entirely closed, and the small one, near the middle of the sponge in
which the action had been the most forcible, alone remained partly open.
ON THE VITAL POWERS OP THE SPONGIAD^.                               44i

Finding that this sponge, which M'as 2 inches in length, 1 inch in breadth,

and I of an inch in thickness, was by far the most interesting and active in

its habits, I determined to direct my observations more especially to its

proceedings for the future, and I accordingly separated it from the others

and placed it in a saucer full of salt water fresh from the sea, and put a few

small green fuci along with it. In 7 minutes after immersion in the cool

fresh salt water, the ex-current action again commenced slowly ; the closed

oscula gradually expanded, but not fully and completely, and the action was

steadily and moderately sustained ; at a quarter to 12 the action was so strong

and vigorous as to again cause a considerable elevation of the surface of the

water above the central and most active osculum of the largest sponge. It

is evident, therefore, that temperature has much to do with the activity of its

action, and that the animal is quickly cognisant of such changes, and is rapidly

amenable to the stimulus of a fresh and cool supply of the element in which

it exists ; and it is equally evident that its actions are not merely mechanical or

periodical, but subject to its own control, and that it can as readily avail

itself of favourable circumstances for imbibing nutrition or of protecting

itself from adverse circumstances, as the higher organized and more elabo-

rately constructed classes of animals. At 12 o'clock, on returning to

examine the state of affairs, I found the sponge perfectly quiescent, and some

of the oscula again closed. I immediately changed the water in this case,

pouring it full on the sponge in a large stream, and at 4 minutes after 12 the

currents were again in full action ; at 11 minutes after 12, the stream from

the central osculum was so forcible as to elevate the water to a considerable

extent at the surface immediately above it; at a quarter past 12 one of the

large groups of oscula commenced ejecting a stream so strong as also to pro-

duce an elevation of the water immediately above it. It would appear

therefore that the action of the different oscula is not simultaneous, but that

each is independent, to a considerable extent, of the other. At 1 o'clock, when

myI left them, they were still in action, although slowly ; and on  return at

3 o'clock they wei'e all apparently quiescent, and remained so for the remainder

of the day. At 11 p.m. I drained the water from them, and left them so

--for the night.
   June 6th. At half-past 9 o'clock I put more sea-water to them. It had

stood some time in the sun, and was probably above the ordinary tempera-

ture. In about 5 minutes the ex-current action commenced, and proceeded

languidly for about half an hour, and then ceased. At half-past 12 1 drained

the water from it, and supplied it with water fresh from the sea, and the ex-

current action almost immediately recommenced, and at 1 o'clock was so

forcible that the surface above the two large groups of oscula was consider-

ably elevated by the force of the jets ; at a quarter to 2 o'clock the action

had entirely ceased. I drained off the water, and poured fresh water over

the sponge by jerks, until I had filled the saucer; again, in a few minutes,

action commenced in the large group of oscula near the largest end of the

sponge, and attained sufficient force to elevate the surface of the water by

the force of its jet at 6 minutes to 2 o'clock ; but this time it was the only

osculum in action, the smaller central one and the other large compound

osculum remaining quite inert, and the central one so completely closed, that

it was only by minute inspection with a 2-inch lens, and a complete familiarity

with the surface of the sponge, that [ could make certain of its precise posi-

tion ; at 20 minutes after 2 o'clock the central small osculum had opened,

and was sufficiently in action to elevate the surface of the water above it;

but the third, the large one at the smaller end of the sponge, was still inert,

and the small oscula within the large outer orifice were closely shut. At
--442 REPORT 1856.

37 minutes past 2 the third osculuiu had opened, and the whole three were
in strong action, each projecting a stream so strong as to elevate the surface
of the water above it. This independence and inequality of action is remark-
ably curious. I left them in the above-described state of full action at 15

minutes to 3 o'clock. On my return at a quarter past 3, action had entirely

ceased, the group of oscula at the small end of the central osculum were
closely shut up, but in the group at the largest end of the sponge the mouths
of the oscula were open, but apparently entirely inert. At half-past 1 1 p.m.

--1 drained off the water for the night.
   June 7th. I put fresh water to the same sponge at half-past 9. No action

was observed until half-past 10 ; it was then very languid, and ceased entirely
in a very short time ; at a quarter past 12 I again drained off the water, and
poured fresh cool water on the sponge; in about 10 minutes the ex-current
action commenced from the two large groups of oscula near the ends of the
sponge, and in a very short period, about 10 minutes, the action became so
strong as to produce the elevation at the surface of the water immediately
above them. During this period the small osculum in tlie middle of the
sponge was closed and entirely inert. I did not examine it again until
2 o'clock, when the action had ceased ; at 1 1 p.m. I poured off the water as

--usual.
   June 8th. At 10 o'clock I poured fresh sea-water over it and filled the
saucer as usual ; within one minute it commenced ejecting granules of effete
matter from the two large oscula, and in a few minutes the action was strong
enough to produce the usual elevation at the surface of the water. I looked
carefully with a 2-inch lens for the central osculum, but could not detect it,
and it had all the appearance of having been permanently closed by a mem-

brane. When in full action the membranous margins of the oscula are

tense and very distinctly defined ; but when the action becomes languid or
ceases, the orifices contract to about half the diameter they assume in an
active state, the marginal membranes lose their tension, and the edge becomes
very indistinct. Previously to a general cessation of action, it will sometimes
occur that one or two of the oscula of the group will assume this inert and
flaccid appearance, while from one only the stream will continue to issue in
full force, and this condition was assumed by the two large compound oscula

this morning at 12 o'clock.
    It is a remarkable circumstance, that of eighteen other specimens of the

same species of sponge which were treated in precisely the same manner as
the one whose history I have just recorded, three only of them had assumed
ex-current action up to 12 o'clock on the 8th of June. It is evident therefore
that the commencement or the cessation of action is not a merely mechaniial
effect, arising from temperature, or the general effect of particular circum-
stances, but that, as in other animals, each individual commences or ceases
action as may be dictated by its especial necessities.

    At 8 minutes past 12 o'clock the osculum at the large end was still in full
work. At a quarter to 1 o'clock the osculum at the small end had resumed
action, and in the mean time no cessation had occurred in the action at the
large end. At half-past 1 o'clock I left both groups of oscula in steady
action, each producing its elevated spot on the surface of the water. On my

return at 4; o'clock they appeared perfectly quiescent. I immediately poured
off the water and gave them fresh cool sea-water, and on looking at them
again at 5 o'clock, they were in very powerful action, and the middle single
osculum that had remained closed so long, had now opened and poured forth a
stream that raised a considerable elevation on the surface of the water,
and the osculum was fully expanded. At 5 o'clock the same osculum had
ON THE VITAL POWERS OF THE SPONGIAD^.  443

ceased to act and was again completely closed, while the other two groups of
oscula were still in full action.

    I frequently examined the condition of the sponge until past 11 o'clock
p.^f., and found the ex-current action of both the large groups of oscula in
full force. The action of the ex-current streams had been more vigorous

and continuous than on any day since the commencement of my observations

of it, and the elevation of the water at the surface above the oscula had been
larger than ordinary, indicating a greater amount of force than usual. At
half-past 11 P.M., when I poured off the water for the night, the two large
compound oscula were in full play.

  --June 9.' At 10 o'clock I put fresh sea-water to the sponge, and within a

minute the ex-current action was apparent at both the large groups of oscula,
and in a few minutes became in full vigour. The central smaller single
osculum was perfectly closed, and not the slightest appearance of it was to
be detected with a 2-inch lens. The action in the two groups of oscula
continued in full force until half-past 12, when the group at the small
bend had ceased to act, and the smaller oscula of the group had contracted
to about half their full diameter. I placed a drop of water charged with indigo
immediately above this osculum, and watched the effect with a 2-inch lens,
and was surprised to find that its action was reversed, and the molecules of
indigo passed into it with a considerable degree of rapidity. I repeated the
application of the drop of water charged with indigo several times, and the
result was the same. Occasionally the ex-current action was resumed for an
instant, and a large molecule of indigo would be expelled, but the next mo-
ment the in-current action would be resumed. At half-past 1 I repeated
the application of the drops of water charged with indigo with the same
result,' when it suddenly broke forth again into strong ex-current action, ele-

vating the surface of the water immediately above it in the usual manner,

and continued thus to act. The reversal of the action in the osculum in
this instance was apparently effected by the vigour of the action in the
other group of oscula ; the whole of these organs being more or less con-
nected, not only by the intermarginal canals, but also by the general system
of interstitial canals of the mass of the sponge.

   At half-past 2 o'clock the action of both of the groups of oscula had
entirely ceased. At 10 minutes to 3 o'clock I drained oft' the water, and put
fresh sea-water to it, and the ex-current action from both groups commenced
again in less than a minute, and were in full action in about 2 minutes. The
action continued untill 11 p.m., when the water was drained off for the night..

  --June 10. At 10 a.m. I put fresh water to the sponge. The ex-current

action commenced immediately from the large groups of oscula, elevating
the surface of the water as usual. The central osculum remained perfectly
closed, presenting the appearance of a new membrane having been formed

over its orifice, and be! w it on the side of the sponge 1 observed that a
new osculum had been formed about the same size as the largest of those
already existing. The stream poured from this osculum was as powerful as

any of the older ones, and it elevated the water at the surface strongly,

although the line of action was in a diagonal direction, and therefore passing
through a greater distance than those that were ejected in nearly a straight

line upward. At 11 1 left the whole of these oscula in full play. On
my return at 3 o'clock all action had apparently ceased. On carefully

examining the state of the oscula I had left in full action, I found that the
closing membrane of each was contracted in such a manner as to close each
orifice all but a centi'al opening, so small as to appear by the c:l.' a 2-inch

lens scarcely capable of admitting the point of a pin. I drained otf the water
--444 REPORT 185C.

and poured fresh sea-water slowly over the sponge, and positioned it again
for observation, and found that it was again in full action, having the three
oscula distended to the fullest extent of their capability. At half-past 4;
when I returned, they were perfectly quiescent, and the oscula had resumed
the appearance I have described above, with the very minute orifice in the
centre. I left them in that condition, and at 7 o'clock examined them again,
when I found them still quiescent ; but one of the two large groups of oscula
and the new one were entirely closed, while the other osculum at the largest
end of the sponge had opened to the extent of about one-third of its diameter,
and the membrane presented the appearance of a series of lines or corrugations
radiating from the centre to the circumference. I have since frequently
observed the same appearance when the oscula have been in a half-closed

condition.

   I observed today that three new oscula had been opened about midway
between the large group at the largest end of the sponge and the base of
the sponge ; these new organs entered upon their function with as much vigour
as the older ones, ejecting their streams with an equal degree of force. The
new osculum, formerly described as having been opened beneath the central
osculum, was increased in diameter; and the central one, formerly so energetic

--in its action, remained completely closed.
   June 11, 12, and 13. I continued to watch closely the action of this
interesting and active specimen. It continued to exhibit results very similar
to those already recorded. The three new oscula beneath the group at the
large end increased somewhat in diameter and acted with much force. The
central osculum, up to June 13, continued completely closed, and not the
slightest indication of its former existence could be discerned. Considerable
alteration had also taken place in the two large groups of oscula. At an

early period of my observations I sketched each of these groups carefully,

that I might be under no subsequent mistake regarding them ; and I was
induced to do so from having observed that even during the same day the
oscula in the same group varied in the relative degree of their diameter when
in full action ; and I have since frequently observed that sometimes the whole
were fully expanded and in vigorous action, while at other times the largest
osculum of the group would be very active, while the lesser ones were par-
tially closed and very languidly in action ; thus while from the large one the
molecules were ejected with great force and rapidity, those from the minor
ones seemed to float gently from their orifices until they came under the
influence of the forcible stream flowing from the large and active osculum.

   Some of the smaller oscula in each group have become apparently perma-
nently closed, while others have assumed greater dimensions : thus the confi-
guration of each of these large groups had become greatly modified, and the
sketch of them in their former condition was anything but a faithful portrait

of their present appearance.
   These variations in the position and diameter of the oscula are very inter-

esting, but are not so surprising as they may appear at the first blush. If we

examine the surface of the sponge in its most distended condition while in
full action, we see that immediately beneath the dermal membrane there is
a complicated system of large ex-current canals, inosculating with each other
in every possible direction, and forming a wide but irregular cloacal network.

At any point therefore in the course of these canals oscula may be generated
in accordance with the necessities of the animal, and new ones having been
thus generated, a portion of the older organs becomes more or less useless,
and during the cessation of action their membranous lip becomes firmly and

permanently closed.
ON THE VITAL POWERS OF THE SPONGIADiE.  445

    The systems of large cloacal or ex-current canals are very visible by the

aid of a 2-inch lens while the sponge is distended and in full action, but in

its inactive and contracted tjondition they are not so readily to be traced.
About 1 o'clock I perforated the dermal membrane with a needle in two places,

directly above one of these large canals, and immediately applied drops of

sea-water charged with indigo, but no immediate result arose from this expe-
riment. At 5 o'clock of the same day, June 13th, I observed that the
punctured orifices were much smaller, and had become oval in form, and at
11 o'clock P.M. they were scarcely visible. At 10 o'clock on the following

morning, June 14th, previously to placing the sponge in water, they were

not visible ; but after the expansion of the sponge by the inhalation of water
they were barely distinguishable, but the orifices were entirely closed by
membrane, apparently as thick and strong as the adjoining uninjured portions
of the dermal membrane.

    It is thus evident that the formation of new oscula on the lines of inter-

marginal ex-current canals is not due to accidental circumstances, but that
they are instinctively formed or closed up in accordance with the physiolo-

gical necessities of the animal. This law is also demonstrated by the fact,
that when a slice of considerable dimensions was removed from the upper
surface of a specimen of this species, when three large orifices were generated
by the sections at right angles of as many large canals, none, either of the

large orifices thus created, or of the numerous smaller ones, remained open

after a lapse of twenty-two hours.

  --June 14. During the whole of this day the largest osculum of the group

at the small end of the sponge continued in strong and steady action ; all the
other oscula remaining inactive and closed.

  --June 15. No traces of the punctured wounds above the large intermar-

ginal canals were visible. The sponge commenced action at 10 o'clock a.m.,
when water was put to it in exactly the same manner as recorded on the
14th, and the action was confined to the single large osculum at the small
end of the sponge. At half-past 11 a.m. the whole of the remaining oscula
opened, and commenced pouring forth streams of water vigorously. The
smaller oscula of the groups at the small end of the sponge were apparently
permanently closed, and the single large osculum had much increased in

diameter.

   I continued my observations on this sponge from the 16th to the 28th of
June, with variable results. Some days it remained perfectly inert, but it

generally inhaled and exhaled water with more or less vigour for some
hours each day ; and I could usually induce action by pouring on it a small
stream from a few inches above it, or by running the water over it for a few
minutes with a spoon.

   On the 29th I poured the water from it and some other specimens of the

same species at 7 a.m., and placing it in a pan on fresh fuci, I brought it

with me to London, where I immersed it in sea-water which I had brought
with me at 7 o'clock p.m. I continued to treat it as heretofore, and on giving
it some fresh sea- water on the Istof July, it slowly commenced action from the
large osculum at the small end of the sponge. On weighing it after having

been immersed about an hour in water, July 1st, I found it weighed 128
grains after having been immersed in water two hours. I was induced to
weigh it, from observing that it was paler in colour than usual, and had a

more rugged or warted surface than customary. On the 10th of June, at

10 A.M., I had previously weighed this sponge, first, after having been out of
the water the whole night, when it weighed 137 grains, and at 12 o'clock of
the same day, after being in water two hours, when it weighed 144 grains,
--446 REPORT 1856.

having increased in weight one-nineteenth, or rather more than 5 per cent.
The difference between the first and second weighing, under similar circum-

stances, therefore amounted to 16 grains. It had thus lost one-ninth of its

original weight.

   I continued to observe daily the condition of this sponge which had previ-

ously afforded me such satisfactory results. It exhibited very little difference

in appearance until the 15th of July, when tt became somewhat paler in

colour; after being an hour out of the water it weighed 121 grains. I con-
tinued to examine it frequently from the 15th to the 20th of July, and I found

that the paleness that I had noticed on the former date, was occasioned by

a gradual dissolution or change of the dermal membrane, the remains of
which hung about the sponge in the form of small flocculent fragments.

This dissolution or change of the dermal membrane produced a remarkable

alteration of its external features. Beneath the old dermal membrane, as I

before stated, there were several large superficial canals which meandered

irregularly over nearly every part of the sponge, with which the oscula were

always  connected                                               but  after the dissolution  of the  membrane,  the  whole
                                                             ;

of these closed canals were uncovered, and became simply a series of deeply

indented channels on the exposed surface, and no membranous oscula were
any longer apparent; but in the places formerly occupied by these, there
remained a series of large, irregular orifices only, without any membranous

veil whatever that was apparent. Under these circumstances, the sponge
presented a much more rugged and attenuated appearance than it had pre-

viously exhibited, and I accordingly weighed it again, under precisely the

former circumstances, and was surprised to find that the weight was 121
grains, being precisely the same as when weighed five days previously.

   From the 1st of July to the 20th I examined this sponge frequently, and

often endeavoured to excite it to ex-current action by pouring water over it,

but without success. On the 21st of July I omitted to replace it in the water

at night, and in the morning I found it was dead, giving forth a peculiar
odour that always accompanies the death of the sponge.

                                             Adhesion of Species.

    It has long been known to naturalists, through the valuable communi-
cations of Dr. Grant in the Edinburgli Philosophical Journal, vol. xiv.
p. 115, that individuals of the same species of sponge growing near each other,
united and became as one sponge, when by their natural extension they came
in contact ; and that individuals of different species under similar circum-
stances, however closely they might embrace each other, never became
organically united. I have frequently seen these facts verified in their natural
localities at Tenby, and under other circumstances. I determined therefore
to endeavour to ascertain, if possible, the phaenomena that were exhibited
under such occasions of coalescence.

   On the 4th of June, at 3 p.m., I placed nine small specimens of Hyme'

niacidon caruncula in a saucer-full of salt-water with a few green fuci in it,

and I arranged the sponges gently in contact with each other. On

examining them at 11 o'clock a.m. on the 5th of June, I found that five of
these specimens in which the contact had been complete, were firmly

cemented together. Two of them were one and a half inch in length, and

three-fourths of an inch in breadth, and the others about half that size; but
so strong was the adhesion, that the largest four, full of water, were readily
sustained out of the water by the smallest of the united group. Twenty hours
therefore had sufficed to unite them firmly.

   At 3 o'clock P.M. of the 5th of June, 1 placed several specimens of the
ON THB VITAL POWERS OP THE SPONOIAD^.  44f

same sponge in contact in pairs ; at half-past 1 1 p.m., on pouring off
the water carefully, I found some of the pairs had slightly adhered to each

other.

   I left them in contact without further disturbance, and it is evident that
adhesion will, to a certain extent, be effected in eight or nine hours, an
amount of exertion of vital action that was scarcely to have been expected.
At half-past 9 o'clock on the following morning, June 6th, I found the junc-
tion of the four pairs of sponges had been strongly and completely effected
during the night, and while deprived of water. The united portions in two

of the pairs were three-eighths of an inch in length. No traces of the lines

of separation that existed on the previous day could be detected with a 2-inch
lens, and the uniting membrane stretched from one to the other, without the

slightest depression or indication of the former state of separation. Thus we

find a strong and complete junction effected in each of the four cases in so

short a time as eighteen hours.

   None of these specimens when taken from the rock were compressed or

otherwise injured, and in none of them were there any oscula visible. On

the following morning, when supplied with sea-water after having been left ex-
posed to the air and without water during the night, the numerous oscula
made their appearance, and the ex-current action became general and very

vigorous, creating currents in every possible direction at the surface of the

dish of water in which they were kept.

 --June 7. I examined them again at half-past 9 o'clock, and found the

adhesion between the specimens had been strengthened ; I gave them fresh
water, but not finding any action taking place at 12 o'clock, I removed them
and pickled them in bay-salt and water.

   I repeated this experiment on the adhesion of individuals of the same spe-
cies many times and always with the same results. Specimens oi Hal. panicea,
when placed in contact, also adhered to each other, but they did not appear

to adhere either so rapidly or with so much force as in Hym. caruncula.
When specimens of Hal. panicea and Hym. caruncula were placed in close

contact, no adhesion whatever took place.
    I fully expected this result, as I had often examined the two species grow-

ing closely pressed against each other on the rock, and always found that,
although the contact was close and apparently forcible, no adhesion could

ever be detected.

   On several subsequent occasions I placed pairs of specimens of Hymenia-

cidon caruncula in contact at about 1 1 o'clock p.m., after draining the water

from them, and in every instance I found the adhesion took place as readily

without, as with immersion in water.

                                                Reparative powers.

   The remarkable activity of the vital power, as displayed in the rapidity and
strength with which individuals of the same species adhered to each other,
naturally led me to imagine that the power of repairing injuries would be no
less great than that of simply coalescing, and I determined to investigate

--this branch of their economy.
   June 8. At half-past 1 p.m. I wounded a specimen of Hymeniacidon
caruncula, rather exceeding 2 inches in length, in two places. In one case
I made a clean cut across it nearly half an inch in depth ; in the other I
out a notch in it about three- fourths of an inch in length, and the eighth
of an inch wide and deep. At 5 p.m. a manifest alteration had taken
place in the latter case. The edges of the wouad at the dermal membrane
were no longer angular, but were rounded off, and a very thin membrane
--448 REPORT 1856.

appeared to be in course of production over tlie whole of the cut surface.
The surfaces of the first simple incised wound could not be readily separated,
and a sufficient amount of adhesion had evidently taken place within, to
prevent the wounded surfaces from separating without the application of
some amount of violence. At 10 a.m. of the 9th of June, I examined
this specimen again, and found that the deep incised wound had entirely
closed, and a firm and strong membrane had united the previously separated

parts of the surface of the sponge so completely that a separation of the sides
of the wound could not have been effected without a degree of violence that
would have endangered the whole sponge. The large notch that had been
cut on the other end of the sponge had also been completely repaired. The

edges of the wound had lost all their angularity, and the sides of the cut, in
which when first made there were numerous orifices arising from sections
of the great canals, were now covered by the new membrune, which entirely
closed all the orifices caused by the wounding of the sponge ; and so com-
plete was the reparation, that the indentation appeared to be merely one of
the natural depressions of the surface of the sponge. From 11 to 12 o'clock
the sponge exhibited ex-current action from its principal oscula, and among
those in full action was one which had been bisected in the act of making

the deep simple incision across the substance of the sponge.

   On the 8th of June, at 4 p.m., I also wounded several sponges of the same

species hi situ, on the rocks in St. Catherine's cave, by cutting notches
about the eighth of an inch in breadth and depth in their surface, or by cut-
ting out conical masses from near the middle of the sponges about a quarter
of an inch in diameter at the surface of the sponge ; and in another case I
cut a slice from the surface about three quarters of an inch in diameter, and

Myabout one-tenth of an inch in thickness at the middle of the sponge.

object in this experiment was to ascertain whether any difference in the
results would arise from the very different condition under which the last and
the present experiments were made.

   On examining the wounded sponges in their natural localities twenty-four

hours after the wounds had been made, I found the results to be precisely
the same as in those that I had kept in a state of perfect quiescence; the
continued action of the water upon them had not retarded the reparative pro-
cess in the slightest degree, nor had the quiescent condition of those which I

--had retained in the dishes apparently accelerated the healing process.
   June 12. I cut off a piece from the small end of a specimen of H. carun-
cula, about 1| inch in length, at 12 o'clock at noon, and let it remain sepa-
rated for about an hour. I then placed the two surfaces in contact in sea-
water. At half-past 11 p.m. they had already united, but were evidently
not strongly cemented together. I drained off the water as usual at that
period, and left them without any during the night; at 11 a.m., on June 13th,
they were completely and firmly united. On June 13th, at noon, with
a view to ascertain whether the healing process emanated from the dermal
membrane, from the interior substance of the sponge, or from both, I cut
a notch, about the eighth of an inch in width, entirely round the middle of
the same sponge, and then cut it asunder through the middle of the notch,
replaced it in sea-water, and brought the two sides of the section in
close contact, to ascertain whether the healing process would take place
independent of the dermal membrane. On June the 14th, at 10 a.m., I found
the two pieces firmly cemented together without contact of the dermal

--membrane.
   June 13th. At noon, from a specimen of H. caruncula, about 1|^ inch long
by 1^ broad, I cut a slice from the top of the sponge f inch long by about

A- an inch broad, the greatest thickness being about y^th of an inch, laying
open three large ex-cinreiit canals, and numerous other small canals and
cavities, and then replaced it in the water. I also cut seven other specimens
in halves, and then replaced them in the water, bringing the sections into close
contact. June 14th, at 10 o'clock a.m., I found the two pieces firmly

cemented without contact of the dermal membrane. On examining the sponge,

from the top of which I had cut oft' a slice at 12 o'clock, June 13, at 5 o'clock
on the same day, I observed that the three great orifices arising from sections
of great ex-current canals were each in process of being closed. From the
circular margin of each a membrane had extended from the circumference
towards the centre, very nearly closing the smallest of the orifices, and in
the other two cases leaving in one a circular central orifice, one-third of the

original diameter, and in the other about one-fourth of the diameter. On the

following morning, June 14, these apertures were entirely closed, and over
the whole of the wounded surface a new dermal membrane had been formed,
which securely closed ail the numerous small orifices as well as the larger

ones.

   The seven larger sponges which I had separated by cutting into halves,
and then replaced in water with the divided parts again in close contact, were
all found firmly united at 10 o'clock on the following morning, June 14th
and at June 15th, 10 a.m., the reparation of the subjects of the above
experiment were so complete as to quite obliterate the traces of the separation
in some of them. I therefore pickled the specimens. In other cases I cut
the same species of sponges into three pieces and reversed the position of the
middle piece of each, so as to render the sections unconformable ; but this
reversal of position, when the surfaces were brought into close contact, did
not seem in the slightest degree to retard the healing process, or to render
the adhesion of the pieces less firm than when placed together conformably.

                                        Disease and Death.

 --July 1. At 10 A.M. I observed in one of the specimens of Hym. carun-

cula which I had brought from Tenby to London, an appearance of
disease in one of the lobes of the sponge for about half an inch from
the point inwards. There was a tumid appearance of the surface tissues
and a glassy opalescence in the part aff"ected. On smelling this portion of
the sponge, there was a slightly fcetid odour which did not exist in the
healthy portions of it. I immediately cut off this piece about half an inch
from the diseased part, and placed it in a basin by itself in sea-water. In six
hours the diseased appearance had become much more evident, but the
healthy part attached to it remained apparently unaffected. On examining a
section from the surface of the most diseased part, I found the dermal mem-
brane distended by an effusion of an opalescent lymph-like Huid ; thesarcode
in the immediate neighbourhood had lost its red colour, and the parts were
apparently in a decomposing state, but the adjoining portions of the same
tissue presented a healthy appearance. The separation of the diseased piece
from the parent sponge, had apparently been effective in preventing the

spread of the disease, as it retained its usual appearance at the section and
in the other parts of the sponge during the next twenty-four hours, but
shortly after that time, it began to exhibit strong symptoms of disease, and
in a few hours it was evidently dead.

       Nutrition.

I cannot dismiss the subject without a few words regarding the nutri-

tion of the Spongiadfe. That they inhaled and exhaled water abun-

dantly, has been long well known, but what the effects of the exertion of
those functions were has been little noted by naturalists; and although,
by the almost universal consent of zoologists, they have been received as
animals, they have been denied the possession of stomach, intestines, and
almost of every organ that constitutes aniniality, while in truth nearly the
whole of the interior of the animal is one large stomachal cavity, furnished
abundantly with mucous membranes, if I may so term them, covered with a
coat of sarcode, analogous in every respect to the mucous lining of the
intestines of the higher animals, and which performs for the sponge precisely
those functions that the sarcode exerts, ivovnActinophrys jSW upwards, through
every gradation of animal existence, to man, and the rest of the most elabo-

rately constructed animals. This extraordinary substance, designated, in

Actinophrys Sol, sarcode by KoUiker, and in the higher animals known by
anatomists as the mucous lining of the intestines, is apparently an organ
 of very much more importance in the process of digestion than has been
 generally conceived. It is never deficient in any animal, from the lowest

 to the highest. I have examined it from living specimens microscopically in
 Acalepha, Actinia, Radiaria, Fishes, and in the Mouse and other small
 quadrupeds ; and in all, it presents nearly the same appearance. It is semi-
 transparent, has an uneven corrugated surface, and in every instance in which

 I have observed it, abounds with solid and vesicular molecules of extraneous
 matter in a semi- digested state. Generally speaking, of the vesicular mole-
 cules, very few indeed are in a fully distended condition, and by far the

 greater number present every degree of collapse that can well be imagined

 during the dissolution of such bodies by digestion.

     In the Spongiadse there is every reason to believe that the imbibition of
 the molecules by this substance is precisely in the manner described by

 mKoUiker Actinophrys Sol, and from ray examinations of the mucous mem-

 branes of so many classes of animals, I feel persuaded that the mucous lining
 of the intestines in such animals is truly the homologue of the sarcode in

 Actinophrys Sol and in the Spongiadae.

    I will not enter at the present time fully into this subject, as I trust I shall
hereafter, by further investigations, be enabled to do so more completely and

effectively.

In conclusion I may observe, that I have been thus particular in detailing

minutely the history of the actions of the specimen of Hymeniacidon carun-

cula that has been the subject of so great a portion of this communication, as

Weit leads us to some very interesting conclusions.  learn by the daily

records of its actions, that it is neither the mere stimulus of light or even the

presence of fresh water, or the abundance of its natural food, that will at all

times stimulate these animals to action, as in vegetables ; but that, on the con-

trary, they select or reject their food like other animals as their necessities

may dictate ; and not the least curious part of the history of this sponge, is
the power it displayed to determine what parts of its organs should be called

into activity, and what should be quiescent.

During the course of these observations I have frequently observed other

specimens of the same species, and have tested the degree of their action or

repose by the application of a few drops of sea-water charged with molecules

of indigo ; and in almost every case where the oscula were in the slightest

degree open, I have found that although apparently inert, there usually re-

mained a very gentle ex-current action. It will be remembered also, that in

the course of the records of the action of the sponge which has formed the

principal subject of these observations, the general effect of the removal

of the animal from the water is the entire closing of the oscula ; but that on
                                          --

ON THE ARTIFICIAL PROPAGATION OF SALMON.  451

the cessation of the full and vigorous action, the oscula while still immersed
in the water do not close entirely ; the orifices almost always remain more or
less open, and during this condition a comparatively languid circulation

continues.

    These two conditions of the animal action are strongly indicative of the
exertion of two distinct functions ; the vigorous action being that of the
period of feeding, while the gentle one indicates the breathing one only.

   If, during the powerful state of action of the sponge, we introduce a few
drops of water charged with indigo, the rush of the molecules to its outer
surface is immediate ; and if the species be Grantia ciliata or compressa, we
find the sponge deeply tinctured with blue in a very few minutes. After a
brief period we find a few molecules of indigo ejected from the common

faecal orifice of the sponge.

   If the sponge be now removed into fresh water, the ejection of molecules

of indigo continues for hours to be slowly eflFected. After having thus im-
bibed indigo, there is no amount of washing that will not injure the sponge
that will remove the colouring matter ; but if the sponge be removed into
fresh water, it will be found to be free from colour in a period varying from
twelve to twenty-four hours, the process of digestion and defecation having
naturally effected its removal ; and if any molecules remain on the outer sur-

face, a very little water poured over the sponge will now usually remove them.
   The strongly adhesive power inherent in the dermal membranes of sponges

and in all parts of their internal structure, readily accounts for the universal
habit of inosculation, not only as regards the large external branches, but
the internal fibres also, and it is evident that to this active power of
adherence the reticulated forms of fibrous structure is due.

Report of a Committee, consisting of Sir W. Jardine, Bart., Dr.
   Fleming, and Mr. E. Ashworth, upon the Experiments con-

    ducted at Stormontfield, near Perth, for the artificial propagation

    of Salmon.

The migrations of the Salmon between the seas and rivers have long been a
subject of much interest to the proprietors of salmon fisheries, to sportsraen,

and to naturalists ; and the difficulty of making observations, or of obtaining
accurate information, rendered the pursuit of the inquiry if possible more
exciting. The experiments conducted by Mr. Shaw at Drumlanrig, and
Mr. Young at Invershin, produced many valuable and important results;
and being conducted with great care by practical men, entirely independent of
each other, and at stations widely apart, the facts stated were entitled to
every reliance. The opinions of these two men, however, were at variance
on a very important point, viz. the age at which the young fry assumed their
migratory dress and took their departure from the river to the sea
Mr. Shaw making it two years, Mr. Young only twelve or thirteen months.

    These experiments, and the success which had attended artificial propaga-
tion in France, and the extent to which, in that country, the latter was
beginning to be practised economically and for profit ; the trials of Mr.
Garnett at Clitheroe, and of Mr. Ashworth at Outerard in Ireland, attracted
the attention of the fishermen of the Tay; and on the 19th of July, 1852, a
meeting of the proprietors of that river was held at Perth to consider the

                                                              2g2

subject generall}'. This meeting was numerously attehded, and Mr. Thomas
Asiiworth of Po)'nton laid before it and explained the operations which had
been recently carried on by himself and his brother, Mr. Edmund Ashworth,
at their fisheries in Ireland, and recommended strongly that these should now
be attempted for the Tay. The recommendation was acceded to, and the
Earl of RIansfield, who was chairman of the meeting, at once gave permis-

sion to select from his estates any situation favourable for carrying on the
experiments. This was the origin of the Stormontfield breeding ponds, and

an excellent account of their construction, with a detail of the operations con-
ducted in them, was brought before the Natural History Section of the
British Association at their meeting in Glasgow, which led to the support of
the Association, and the appointment of the Committee which has reported
this year to the meeting at Cheltenham*.

    To bring the subject up to the period when the Committee appointed by

the British Association was prepai-ed to act, it will be necessary to mention

the principal points and results of the experiments detailed by Mr. Edmund

Ashworth at Glasgow. These are extremely interesting in themselves, and
are indispensable for the right understanding of the operations which were
afterwards conducted and are now in operationf.

    The situation for the ponds was selected at Stormontfield Mill I, not far from
the Palace of Scone. " A gentle slope from the lade which supplies the
 mill off"ered every facility for the equable flow of water through the boxes
and pond. Three hundred boxes were laid down in twenty-five parallel
rows, each box partly filled with clean gravel and pebbles, and protected at
 both ends with zinc grating to exclude trout and insects. Filtering beds
 were formed at the head and foot of the rows, and a pond for the reception
 of the fry was constructed immediately below the hatching ground. On the
 23rd of November, 1853, operations were commenced, and by the 23rd of
 December, 300,000 ova were deposited in the boxes. The fish were taken

 from spawning beds in the Tay."
    The process of fecundation and of depositing the ova in the boxes was

 conducted by Mr. Ramsbottom, who was engaged for the purpose, his prac-

 tice and experience at Clitheroe and elsewhere giving confidence to his

 manipulations. " The ova were placed in the boxes as nearly similar to

 what they would be under the ordinary course of natural deposition as

--possible, with, however, this important advantage in the bed of the river

 the ova are liable to injury and destruction in a variety of ways. The
 alluvial matter deposited in times of flood will often cover the ova too deep
 to admit of the extrication of the young fry, even if hatched. The impetuosity
 of the streams, when flooded, will frequently sweep away whole spawning

  beds and their contents Д. Whilst deposited in boxes, the ova are shielded
 from injury, and their vivification in large numbers is thus rendered a matter

 of certainty, and the young fish reared in safety. On the 31st of March,
 I85i, the first ovum was observed to be hatched, and in April and May the

     * The Committee named to watch over the expeiiments in progress, and those to be ccm-
  menced in 1856, consisted of Sir W. Jardine, Bart. ; tlie Rev. Dr. Fleming, Prof. Nat. Hist,
 Free College, Edinburgh ; and Mr. Edmund Ashworth, Egerton Hall, Lancashire.

     i Mr. Spottiswoode, the tenant of Stormontfield, with much liberality, also agreed to give
  the use of the ground and water from his mill lade, free of all remuneration ; and we may add,
  that the interest taken by all who had any control over the locality chosen, either in the ma-
  nagement and conducting of the experiments, or in communicating information, could not be
  exceeded ; this of itself is a proof of the importance attached to these operations.

      Д " These causes, in addition to the great destruction of ova, as well as young fry, by wild
  fowl, fish and insects, all tend to limit the natural increase of the salmon,''

greater portion had come to life and were at large in the boxes ; in June they

were admitted into the pond, their average size being about an inch and a

half in length. From the period of their admission into the pond the fry-

were fed daily with boiled liver rubbed small by the hand. Notwithstanding

the severity of the winter, they continued in a healtiiy condition, and in the

spring of the present year (1855) were found to have increased in size to

the average of M and 4 inches in length. On tiie 2nd of May, 1855, a

meeting of the Committee (appointed by the Tay proprietors in 1852) was

held at the pond, to consider the expediency of detaining the fry for another

year, or allowing them to depart. A comparison with the undoubted smolts

of the river then descending seawards, with the fry in the ponds, led to the

conclusion that the latter were not yet smolts, and ought to be detained.

Seventeen days afterwards, viz. on the I9th May, a second meeting was

held, in consequence of the great numbers of the fry having in the interim

assumed the migratory dress. On inspection, it was found that a considerable

portion were actual smolts, and the Committee came to the determination to

allow them to depart. Accordingly, the sluice communicating with the Tay

was opened, and every facility for egress afforded. Contrary to expecta-

tion, none of the fry manifested any inclination to leave the pond until

the 24th of May, when the larger and more mature of the smolts, after

having held themselves detached from the others for several days, went off

Ain a body.  series of similar emigrations took place, until fully one-half of

the fry had left the pond and descended the sluice to the Tay. It has long

been a subject of controversy, whether the fry of the salmon assume the

migratory dress in the second or third year of their existence. So favourable

an opportunity of deciding the question as that afforded by the Stormontfield

experiment was not to be overlooked. In order to test the matter in the

fairest possible way, it was resolved to mark a portion of the smolts in such

Aa maimer that they might easily be detected when returning as grilse.

temporary tank, into which the lish must necessarily descend, was constructed

at the junction of the sluice with the Tay ; and as the shoals successively left

the pond, about one in every hundred was marked by the abscision of the

second dorsal fin. A greater number were marked on the 29lh of May than

on any other day, in all about 1200 or 1300. The result has proved highly

satisfactory. Within two months of the date of their liberation, viz. between

the 29th of May and 31st of July, twent3--two of the young fish so marked when

in the state of smolts, on their way to the sea, have been, in their returning mi-

gration up the river, recaptured, and carefully examined. This fact may be

considered as still further established, by observing the increased weight,

according to date, of the grilse caught and examined ; those taken first weigh-

ing 5 to 9^ lbs., then increasing progressively to 7 and 8 lbs., whilst the one

captured 31st July weighed no less than 9| pounds. In all these fish the
wound caused by marking was covered with skin, and in some a coating of

scales had formed over the part. Although twenty-two only are mentioned,

the taking of which rests on indubitable evidence, nearly as many more are

reported from distant parts ; the weights and sizes of these have not been

forwarded.

"The experiment at Stormontfield has afforded satisfactory proof, that a

portion at least of the fry of the salmon assume the migratory dress, and

descend to the sea shortly after the  close of the first  year of  their existence
                                                                                                                              ;

and what is far more important in a practical point of view, it has also

demonstrated the practicability of rearing salmon of marketable value within

Atwenty months from the deposition of the ova.            very interesting question

still remains to be solved. At what date will the fry now in the pond

become smolts ? Hitherto they have manifested no disposition to migrate,
and if the silvery coat of the smolt be not assumed till the spring of 1856,
a curious anomaly will present itself. Some of the fry, as smolts, will, for
the first time, be descending seawards, of the average weight of 2 oz. ; some
as grilse will be taking their second departure to the sea; and others still
more advanced will even have completed their second migration, and return
to the river as salmon 10 or 12 lbs. in weight. It is much to be desired, that
the experiment at Stormontfield could be continued for a year or two longer,
till the links in the chain of evidence now wanting to complete the natural
history of the salmon should be obtained. All praise is due to Lord Mans-
field for the liberal manner in which he has aided the carrying out the ope-
rations to this time, and from which he can reap little advantage, beyond
the satisfaction to an enlightened mind, of promoting the interests of science
and the welfare of the community.

 --" Since arriving in Glasgow I have received a communication from my

friend Mr. Buist, in which he says, ' In my opinion, you have kept your

statements within the truth, as I have got satisfactory evidence of twenty-
two marked grilse being taken, besides others which have been reported ; and
I have no doubt many have been thrown in the heap without being noticed
by the careless fishermen. There is at present a mystery as regards the
progress of the young salmon ; there can be no doubt, that all in our ponds
are really and truly the offspring of salmon ; no other fish, not even the seed of

them, could by any possibility get into the ponds ; now we see that about
one-half have gone off" as smolts in their season as grilses. The other half
remain as parrs, and the milt in the males is as much developed in proportion
to the size of the fish as their brethren of the same age 7 to 10 lbs. weight,
whilst these same parrs in the pond do not exceed 1 oz. in weight. This is
an anomaly in nature, which I fear cannot be cleared up at present. I hope,
however, by proper attention, some light may be thrown upon it from our
experiments next spring. The female parrs in the pond have their ova so
undeveloped, that the granulations can scarcely be discovered by a lens of
some power. It is strange, that both Young and Shaw's theories are likely
to prove correct, though seemingly so contradictory, and the much-disputed
point settled, that parrs (such as ours at least) are truly the young of the

salmon.'

  We may now consider ourselves at the close of the Glasgow meeting.

The Committee which is now reporting to you prepared to act, and one-half
of the fish hatched in the spring of 1854 are still in the Stormontfield ponds,
and under the charge of their faithful guardian, Peter Marshall. These fish
are still in the state of parr. Mr. Ashworth had arranged that a book
should be kept at the ponds, in which every occurrence worthy of notice

--should be entered, and we shall allow that book to tell its own story: "These

parr continued, during the winter 1855-56, healthy and in good condition,

but did not appear to make much advance in size until the month of April
1856. They were then in good condition, but not much larger than those
which had been allowed to leave the ponds the previous year."

   As the migratory season approached, the fish were closely watched.

--Peter Marshall reports, 19th March, "that the parrs in the pond continued

very healthy." 19th April: " Ponds again inspected, and some experiments

--tried to mark with silver rings. They were then also healthy." 26th

April : " Found that a great change had taken place upon them, and that
they were fast getting into their smolt state ; marked a few with the silver
rings ; found it to answer very well, and that the fish went off very lively on
                                          ;

 being turned into the river ; fixed on a place in the river where the smolts
 can be intercepted for tiie purpose of being taken out and marked. They
 showed a decided tendency to go out, and from 28th April to the 24th of
 May, the shoals went off daily from the ponds."

     It is supposed, as a fair estimate, that about 120,000 fry in all have left

 the ponds in May 1856, and of those 1435 have been marked, being 300

 with silver rings, and 11 35 by having the lower lobe of the tail cut diagonally

--off. The return of some of those marked fish was anxiously watched for, and on

 the 30th of July Mr. Buist writes to me, " There has been a very large catch
 of grilses, indeed in such numbers, that the people don't take care to examine

 them. On 12th July we had a grilse of 3^ lbs. weight, with the lower fork
 cut off the tail, such as we marked in April and May, and several who were

 present at the marking of the smolts considered that it was one of them

--another with the same mark was reported, but not produced to me." On the 7th

 of August Mr, Buist again writes, " Several grilse with cut tails have been

taken within the last week." Up to the time of the reading of this Report,

 no fish marked with rings had been taken, but when the small number marked
 is considered, this is not remarkable. The experiment of the first hatching
may now be said to be completed. The results have been satisfactory in two
 waj's. In showing the practicability of hatching, rearing, and maintaining
in health a very large number of young fish for a period of two years, and

 not reckoning the original expense of the ponds at a comparatively small cost;

it may be worthy of consideration, whether the " large catch " mentioned
by Mr. Buist as taking place this yeai', may not have been, in part at least,
due to the numbers that have been lately turned out. It has also been again
proved, we think without dispute, that the young fish turned out as smolts
return as grilses within a period of from five to ten weeks. Not so many
marked fish have been taken as could have been wished ; at the same time

there have been sufficient to establish this fact.

   We now come to the experiments of the present year, which have been

conducted as carefully as possible, and we hope to be able to report what
the final results may be at your next meeting ; and if there is a partial
migration before that time, or if a certain number of the fish now in confine-
ment take upon them the migratory dress, then we may assume that a similar
process takes place in the rivers, and that a, portion of the broods do seek the
sea, at the age of from twelve to fourteen months after they are hatched. In

conducting experiments of this kind, there are always attendant circumstances

not quite natural that we shall have to contend with ; and it may now be
urged, that the regular feeding during winter might bring the young fish

sooner to maturity, or on the other side of the question, that the confinement
of so many within a small compass might retard their growth. But on com-

paring the fish of the ponds with those in the rivers, we find a remarkable
similarity and agreement of the different stages, so far as we can judge of the
age of those in the rivers. If, on the other hand, we can by care, with good
and regular feeding during winter,^rce 07i, as it were, the young, or some por-

tion of them, to be in a fit state to migrate in twelve or thirteen months, it will
be a very great point gained in the object we have in view (the artificial
increase of the salmon), and it does not appear to us that this is impracti-

cable.

   In order to try over again the experiments we have just described as con-

cluded in May last, arrangements were made at Stormontfield to fill the boxes

Avith fresh impregnated spawn, and to take every care tliat this should be done
with exactness. The taking of the fish for spawning was commenced on the
22nd of November, and continued until the 1 9th of December, 1855; in that time

183 boxes were filled, each beiug supposed to contain 2000 ova. On the 16th

December last, Mr. E- Ashworth, on the part of the British Association

Committee, accompanied by Mr. Buist of Perth, and Mr. Ramsbottom, met

the fishermen at a ford near the junction of the Almond and the Tay, for the

--purpose of obtaining spawn. Our pond journal relates, " When we arrived

at the river they had caught two female fish, and at the next cast of the net

two other female fish were taken. At the third cast they captured a male

Wefish in fine condition, from 2i to 28 lbs. weight.  had now full oppor-

tunity of seeing the whole process of spawning performed. The female fisli,

after" being relieved of their ova, swam away quite lively, and each were

marked by punching a hole in the tail *."

The male fish proved to be one of the fish which had been caught by Mr.

Ramsbottom i?i December lS5f-, and marked at. that time by the dead fin

being cut off.

  --On I8fh Februury, 1856, Peter Marshall reports, " The spawn all healthy,

and have every appearance of coming to life."

   On 3rd March. " The appearance of the spawn still continues very

healthy, but not yet quite ready for hatching."

These reports were continued, and the ova that were first deposited,

viz. on the 22nd of November, 1855, came to life on the ?>rd oi April, 1856.
The others in succession and those last deposited, viz. \9th December, were

hatched on the 1 1th of April, showing a difference of only eight days in the

hatching, although there was fourteen between the different dates of

deposition in the boxes.

Upon the dispersion or turning out the last portion of the previous brood

in the end of May, the rearing pond Avas emptied, thoroughly cleaned out

and prepared for the reception of the young fish of this year, still in the

spawning boxes, but now increasing in size. On the \st of Juli/ last, your
Committee visited Perth, and in company with Mr. Buist and Mr. Walsh

inspected the ponds. At this time a large proportion of the young fish had
found their way to the rearing ponds. Some were still in the communicating

race through which the water flowed gently, and a few still continued in the

small pools of the spawning boxes. After the ova are hatched or come to

life, the young are allowed to find their own way to the rearing pond ; this
they do gradually, and with the exceptions stated, had nearly all reached it.

They appeared quite healthy, were feeding upon flies and other insects, and

when a small quantity of their artificial food (boiled liver grated) was thrown

in, they would rush towards it in shoals. The reports of the keeper since

--the 1st of July have been equally satisfactory, " The young are as thriving

as could be wished in every way."

This, then, is the state and condition of the experiment which your Com-

mittee consider thej' have under charge. Nothing further can be done until

the time arrives next year, when it is supposed a part, or the whole of the

brood, may assume the migrator}^ dress, and be ready to remove to the sea.

We propose to take such measures as will allow us to watch this narrowly,

and also if the migratory dress be assumed, to mark a large number before

turning out.

 --Note to Report on Stormontfield Ponds. The importance of arti-

ficial impregnation, and the general question of changes and migration, is also
being attended to elsewhere, and we trust, that as soon as the natural history,
the " rise and progress " of the Salmon shall have been completed, a similar
series of experiments will be instituted, to determine that of other migratory
fishes which have not yet been bred or kept in confinement. Mr. Shaw bred
and reared the " Sea Trout " of the Solway, and we have given a series of
figures of this fish from the length of an inch to a weight of 4| lbs. * ; but
the fish of the Tweed, known as the " Bull Trouf," has never been examined

through its different stages, and except those now in the Duke of Rox-

burghe's ponds at Floors, has never been bred in confinement.
    Ponds similar in construction to those at Stormontfield were erected

in 1855 by the Duke of Roxburghe near Floors, and upon writing to his
Grace regarding them, every information has been kindly supplied by
himself, and a detailed account, at his desire, has been drawn up by the
Superintendent of the Tweed River Police ; and as this bears so much
upon our subject, it is thought that some extracts from it will not now be

out of place :

    " The pond is situate on a small rivulet called Stodrig Burn, and is about
sixty yards from the Tweed, within the policies of Floors Castle, near Kelso.
The breeding boxes or troughs I caused to be made similar to those at Stor-
montfield, and they consist of four, laid parallel, 18 feet long, subdivided
into four compartments, 4-^ feet long, the only division between the troughs
being a l^-inch deal, instead of the gravel walk as at Stormontfield. The
water, which is raised by a dam at the upper end, is made to fall into a deep
trough which adjoins the breeding troughs, from which it is as equally dis-
tributed, and after flowing over the gravel, it falls into an aqueduct 18 inches
wide, and which is carried round the margin of the receiving pond, which is
oval-shaped, and about 30 feet long by 15 wide, in which there is about

18 inches of water, and into it the aqueduct or canal discharges itself.
    " The pond was constructed in the latter months of 185.3, but owing to

circumstances, it was not stocked that season.

   " On the 4tli and 5th of March, 1855, the produce of five fish (three of

them grilses) was impregnated with the milt procured from two male fish,
and deposited in the hatching troughs. The spring was very cold, and the
temperature of the water very low ; however, the ova appeared to thrive
nicely, and on the 27th of April the young were formed and moving, and
from their appearance, I expected they should have been hatched in the
course of another week ; but when I examined them on the 4th of May, I

found, to my astonishment, that not a single ovum was in a healthy hatching
state, but thousands of them had in the course of the week become opake,

and the backbone and eyes of the little creatures could be easily seen upon
dividing the ovum with a penknife. The cause of this mishap it was impos-
sible to trace, but there is much reason to believe that it was caused by a
large quantity of lime being used as manure upon the lands through which

the rivulet which supplies the ponds flows.

   "On the 17th, 18th, and 19th of March this year (1856), I had a quantity

 of spawn dug from a shallow bank in the Tweed, near Galashiels, part of

                                         * Illustrations of Scottish Salmonidse.
--458 REPORT 1856.

it being the ova of the salmon, grilse, and bull trout, in about equal portions,
and the whole being not less than 50,000. The ponds being in readiness, it
was conveyed on the 19th of March to Kelso, in boxes filled with fine

gravel or sand in a damp state, and was deposited in the breeding boxes the
same day, where it remained till the 11th of April, when the young were
first observed to be bursting the shell or covering of the ova. Upon exa-
mining the gravel in the boxes on the 2nd of ^lay, I found that all the fish were
hatched, and only those remained which had become addled. Since that
time most of the fry left the hatching boxes, and fell back into the aqueduct,
from which most of them have passed into the receiving pond, where they
now remain. They have as yet received no artificial food, but they appear
quite healthy, and are growing as well as could be desired. There is a
great difference in the size and appearance of them : the largest are about
1^ inch long, while some of them are not over half the size, and the colour
of some is much lighter than of others,which no doubt arises from the different

kinds of ova which were placed there."
    The fishing season in the Tay is now closed for this year, and none of the

--ringed grilse have been recovered ; but INIr. Buist writes to me, " Since I

last wrote (7th August) several grilse with the tail mark have been taken,
and a number of salmon have been taken during the season with last year's
grilse mark upon them. The two last taken were 13 and 19^ lbs." Next
season, therefore, our ringed fry may yet appear as salmon, although they
have not been captured this year in their grilse state. " Our young brood
are thriving well ; but as in former cases, they are already showing a great

disparity in size."

Provisional Report on the progress of a Committee appointed at the
   Meeting in Glasgoiv, September 1855, to consider the question of

  --the Measurement of Ships for Tonnage, consisting of the following

   Gentlemen: Mr. J. R. Napier, Mr. John Wood, Mr. Allan
   GiLMORE, Mr. Charles Atherton, Mr. James Peake, and
   Mr. Andrew Henderson (Reporter).

As the first-named Member of the Committee on Tonnage Measurement,
it becomes my duty to report progress in the matters referred to us, and in
so doing, I beg to premise my report with the remark, that I was induced to

propose this Committee from having had the honour of reading a paper on
Ocean Steamers, Clipper Ships, and their descriptive measurement, to the
Association at their iNIeeting at Liverpool (vide page 152 to 156 of Report,
1854). While at Glasgow, in 1855, a new shipping bill having come into
operation, 1 found that the extreme interest then publicly taken in the general
question of Government interference in shipping affairs seemed to render
this Committee expedient.

    The serious and important character of the subject thereby involved, and
the consequent responsibility imposed on all individuals who may take a
prominent part in this matter, have operated as an obstacle to the immediate
establishment and working operation of this Committee. In the first place,
I beg to notice that the subject of Tonnage Registration, as connected with
our national statistics of shipping, had been brought to the notice of the
public, both at the Institution of Civil Engineers by myself, in 1853, and at
the Society of Arts, by Mr. Charles Atherton, in a manner which has fully
            ON THE MEASUREMENT. OF SHIPg FOB TONNAGE.                 459'

set forth the importance of the subject, and shown that legislative enactment

will be necessary in order to correct the deficiencies of our present tonnage

registration of shipping : the subject, having been thus brought before the

public in its most serious and important aspect, has apparently induced

several of the gentlemen proposed for this Committee to decline the task

thus expected of them.

The absence from Glasgow of many interested in the subject rendering

previous communication impracticable, the President and officers of the

Mechanical Section deeming it desirable that the three scientific bodies

before whom the subject had been brought should participate in the inves-

tigation, Mr. John Scott Russell was nominated to represent the British

Association; and it being also considered expedient to follow the precedent

of the Tonnage Committee of 1849, comprising shipowners, shipbuilders,

ofiicers of the Royal Navy, Merchant Service, and Trinity House, gentlemen

connected with Lloyd's Register, and their surveyors, with several naval

architects and engineers, there were proposed Mr. Allan Gilmore, Mr.

John Wood, and Mr. James R. Napier, representing the shipowners and

shipbuilders of Scotland ; Mr. C. Atherton and Mr. J. Peake, the latter

professions, with the understanding that they were to seek the cooperation

of others.

Accordingly, application was made to noblemen, oflScers and engineers

connected with tlie Navy, the Society of Arts, and Institution of Civil

Engineers, the shipowners' societies of London and Liverpool, the Com-

mittee of Lloyd's Register of Shipping, and to shipbuilders ; although many

of these gentlemen of scientific attainments and practical experience offered

to participate in the investigation, diflSculty and delay occurred from some

of the members of the Committee being resident in distant parts of the

country, while for the deposit of papers and plans for references by the
Committee, no provision had been made even in the metropolis ; the only
means of bringing them under consideration, was the forwarding copies of

them to the principal ports, that the members might elicit the opinion of the

Local Marine Boards and shipowners.

With this view application was made to the Board of Trade for copies of

Acts and Parliamentary papers bearing on the question, to be submitted to
the members of the Committee of the British Association in their investi-

gation of Tonnage Measurement.

The official reply was, that the Board of Trade " d& not consider that the

law of tonnage measurement requires alteration, or that the subject requires

further investigation with any view of amending the law." " Most of the

papers to which you refer are published, and can be purchased. Those

which have not been published, and which are among the records of this

Myoffice.   Lords cannot part with ; but you are at liberty to inspect and take

copies of the plans whirh you have yourself submitted to the Board."

   In addition to these delays and the difficulties thrown in the way by the
routine of a public office, Mr. Allan Gilmore and Mr. John Wood of Glas-

gow, expressed a desire to withdraw from the Committee ; and Mr. Scott

Russell's engagements, especially in connexion with the construction of the

great ship for the Eastern Steam Navigation Company, have so engrossed

his time and attention as to have put it out of his power to take that interest

in this question which has hitherto so laudably characterized his exertions in

the cause of science, in connexion with the labours of the British Association.

Mr. Atherton also declined on the ground that the public agitation of the

question referred to, in which during the past year he was engaged before

the Society of Arts, disqualified him for the time being from taking part o╗
                                          --

460 REPORT 185(╗.

this Committee ; consequently, Mr. James R. Napier and Mr. James Peake
were tiie only parties available for cooperation with myself (Mr. Hender-
son) in this matter, and it has therefore been considered most advisable,
under the circumstances above referred to, not to officiate in our collective
capacity as a Committee of the British Association, but simply to give our
individual aid in promoting the discussions which have thus sprung up.

   With this view, I have myself taken a personal interest in the discussion
of tiie tonnage registration question before the Society of Arts, as exem-
plified by the documents submitted herewith, showing a large amount of

statistical data on steam-ship performances, which has been collected by me

since I originally brought it before the Institute of Civil Engineers in 184<7,
with the view of collecting in the archives of that Institution, statistics of
the progress of improvement in our mercantile marine.

   The papers comprise my view as to tonnage measurement, as laid before

the Board of Trade in 1850 and in 1852, and as to steam navigation and
the speed realized by mail steamers as laid before Parliament in 1851, papers
read before the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1853, the British Association
in 1854, and published by the Society of Arts in 1855; together with the
discussions that have taken place in the Journal of that Society, in 1856, on
Mr. Atherton's paper on Tonnage Registration. The system of measurement
I proposed to the Board of Trade in 1850, being exemplified by z. pro forma
certificate of survey appended to the paper, as well as by a tabular analysis
of the proportion and displacement of different ships and modes of measure-
ment, including the paper read before the Association last year, and
subsequent information, as well as proposed new rules, will be printed com-
plete, before submitting them to the consideration of any committee or
authority that will investigate the whole question.

    Mr. James R. Napier has, I understand, during the past twelve months,
collected much statistical information on the trial performances of steam
ships, and Mr. Peake has taken the opportunity of drawing public attention
to the question of the mode of measurement most available for shipping
 operations ; by these means I beg to bring to the notice of the General
 Committee, that the individual labours of Mr. Atherton, Mr. Napier, Mr.
 Peake, and myself, have now contributed materially to the elucidation of the
subject referred to, thereby facilitating any further effort that may be decided
 on ; and the favourable manner in which Mr. Atherton's paper on the analo-
 gous subject of " Mercantile Steam Transport Economy " has been received
 at the Mechanical Section of the Association, affords every prospect of the
 labours of this Committee being now prosecuted under far more encouraging
 prospects of public support and cooperation, on the part of the shipping
 interests themselves, than has hitherto been the case.

    As an example of the benefit to be derived from public discussion, I may
 refer to the numbers of that popular work, the ' Mechanics' Magazine,' pub-
 lished during the months of April, May, and June last, in which, after fully

 investigating the subject of the deficiencies of our present tonnage regis-
 tration for scientific purposes, the Editor has been pleased to announce
 the following admitted deficiencies and proposed corrections of our present
 system for the consideration of its numerous readers:

     " First. That the tonnage, measurement, and registration of vessels has
 never been brought before Government in any other than a purely fiscal

  point of view.

     " Secondly. That Government in legislating on tonnage registration has
 not contemplated the scientific features of the case, nor those which bear on

  the sea voyage.
          ON THE MEASUREMENT OF SHIPS FOR TONNAGE.   46X

" Thirdly. That undoubtedly there is a point beyond which ships cannot

be safely loaded.
   " Fourthly. That undoubtedly it would be desirable, if possible, to fix

limit to the degree to which ships may be loaded.
    " Fifthly. That as respects the draft of water at which ships leave port,

let the Board of Trade have, if it so please, properly authorized officers to

note and record the facts.

We" Sixthly.  should see with satisfaction a competent committee appointed

by Government, or by the British Association, with a view of ultimately, if

need be, acting on the Government, to take into consideration the foregoing

points."

Such being the declaration of opinions expressed by the Editor of one

of our most popular periodicals devoted to science, in respect to the deficiencies

of our present system of statistical registration of tonnage, it is respectfully
submitted that good and sufficient cause is shown for the re-appointment and
further continued labours of the Committee on this subject; and that under

such indications of the pu'blic appreciation of the utility of such labours,
there can be no doubt of such amendments of the present system being

desired as will conduce to public good.

   It may be in the recollection of members, that at the meeting of the

British Association at Liverpool, in ISS-t, the recommendations of the
General Committee included one, " That it was expedient for the advance-

ment of naval architecture, that a portion of the intended museum at Liver-

pool should Ije appropriated to this subject." Little progress having been

yet made with the museum at that port, while the want of such an establish-

ment for the record and disposal of papers and models added to the difficulties

of the Committee of 1855, it is with satisfaction I have to state that such
difficulties may be considered removed for the future, by the considerate
offer of the Chairman of the Crystal Palace Company, Mr. Arthur Anderson,
to lend the Naval Gallery of the Palace in any manner that can aid the

objects of the Committee, or ventilate the subject.

   Considering that there are already collected at the Crystal Palace Naval
Gallery models of ships and steamers, fishing- boats and life-boats, both

English and foreign, ancient and modern, and that a comparison can be there
made of the rapid improvement in shipping and steam- vessels since the old
tonnage law was abandoned, the great desideratum being that on the six
points enumerated, the question shall be better understood ; and also the neces-
sity for the investigation and re-examination of our system of measurement
and registration ; and that vast advantages would thereby accrue to our mer-
cantile marine, it is hoped that this appeal to the British Association will not

be in vain.                                          Andrew Henderson.

Interim Report to the British Association on Progress in Researches

on the Measurement of Water by Weir Boards. By James

Thomson, C.E.

                                       Belfast, August 6, 1856.

Having at last year's meeting of the Association read in the Mechanical

Section a short paper on the Measurement of Water by Weir Boards, and

having been requested by the General Committee to prepare a Report on

the same subject, 1 beg now to state that I have in the mean time been

Mycollecting information for the purposes of that Report.  professional

engagements have occupied me necessarily so much as to oblige me to defer

for this year the detailed prosecution of the subject and the preparation of

the Report in full. 1 have, however, the gratification of stating, that, with

special reference to the researches entrusted to me by the Association, the

President of the Athenaeum of Boston, United States, Mr. Thomas G. Gary,

has generously sent to me, with the request that it be presented to the

British Association on his behalf, a valuable book containing accounts of

experiments recently carried out on a very grand scale in America, on the

measurement of large bodies of flowing water by means of weir boards and

by other methods, and on the performance of Turbine Water Wheels.

The work is entitled "Lowell Hydraulic Experiments," by James B. Francis.

--In reference to the experiments, Mr. Gary, the donor of the book, states in

his letter to me, " These experiments, made under the direction and at the
expense of the Associated Gompanies of Lowell near Boston, who employ

Mr. Francis as the engineer for their cotton and woollen factories, have cost

about fiOOO sterling; and they make part in a series of investigations which

have cost those Gompanies Б15,000."

In the Report which I hope to submit to the British Association, I shall

have much occasion for reference to these important experiments, and, for

this purpose, I think it right to retain the book in m^ hands at present.

As the expenses incurred in reference to the researches have been but

small, and chiefly for the procuring of books, I do not desire to draw, for

them, on the fund of Б10 placed at my disposal by the Association ; and as

my intention is not to conduct experiments on the subject myself, but chiefly

to give a review of the most important experiments and deductions which

have been made by others, I do not think it necessary to ask for a renewal

of the grant.                          James Thomson.

PROVISIONAL REPORTS.  463

Report of a Committee appointed by " The British Association for the
   Advancement of Science," to consider the formation of a Catalogue
    of Philosophical Memoirs.

--The Committee were appointed on the occasion of a communication from

Professor Henry of Washington, containing a proposal for the publication
of Philosophical Memoirs scattered throughout the Transactions of Societies
in Europe and America, with the offer of cooperation on the part of the

Smithsonian Institute, to the extent of preparing and publishing, in accord-
ance with the general plan which might be adopted by the British Associa-

--tion, a catalogue of all the American Memoirs on Physical Science to con-

sider the best system of arrangement, and to report thereon to the Council.
   The Committee are desirous of expressing their sense of the great im-

portance and increasing need of such a catalogue.
   They understand the proposal of the Smithsonian Institute to be, that a

separate catalogue should be prepared and published for America.

    In the opinion of the Committee,^-
   The Catalogue should embrace the Mathematical and Physical Sciences,
but should exclude Natural History and Physiology, Geology, Mineralogy,
and Chemistry, which would propei'ly form the subject-matter of a distinct
catalogue or catalogues. The difficulty of drawing the line would perhaps be
greatest with regard to Chemistry and Gfeology ; but the Committee would
admit into the Catalogue memoirs not purely Chemical or Geological, but
having a direct bearing upon the subjects of the Catalogue.
   The Catalogue should not be restricted to memoirs in Transactions of
Societies, but should comprise also memoirs in the Proceedings of Societies,
in Mathematical and Scientific Journals, in Ephemerides and volumes of
Observations, and in other collections not coming under any of the preceding
heads. The Catalogue would not comprise separate works.
   The Catalogue should begin from the year 1800.

    There should be a catalogue according to the names of authors, and also
a catalogue according to subjects ; the title of the memoir, date, and other
particulars to be in each case given in full, so as to avoid the necessity of a
reference from the one catalogue to the other.

    The Catalogue should, in referring to a memoir, give the number as well
of the last as of the first page, so as to show the length of the memoir.

   The Catalogue should give in eveiy case the date of a memoir (the year
only), namely, in the case of memoirs published in the Transactions of a
Society, the date of reading, and in other cases the date on the title-page of
the volume. Such date should be inserted as a distinct fact, even in the case
of a volume of transactions referred to by its date.

   The Catalogue should contain a list of volumes indexed, showing the com-
plete title ; in the case of transactions, the year to which the volume belongs,
and the year of publication ; and in other cases, the year of publication, and

the abbreviated reference to the work.

   The references to works should be given in a form sufficiently full to be

easily intelligible without turning to the explanation of such reference.

    The author's name and the date should be printed in a distinctive type, so
as to be conspicuous at first sight ; and generally the typographical execution
should be such as to facilitate as much as possible the use of the Catalogue.

   As to the Catalogue according to the authors' names, the memoirs of the
same author should be arranged according to their dates.

    As to the Catalogue according to subjects, the question of the arrange-
ment is one of very great difficulty. It appears to the Committee that the
scheme of arrangement canaot be fixed upon according to any a priori
--464 REPORT 1856.

classification of subjects, but must he determined after some progress lias
been made in the preliminary work of collecting the titles of the memoirs to
be catalogued. The value of this part of the catalogue will materially
depend upon the selection of a proper principle of arrangement, and the
care and accuracy with which such principle is carried out. The arrange-

ment of the memoirs in the ultimate subdivisions should be according to

their dates.

   The most convenient method of making the Catalogue would appear to be,
that each volume to be indexed should be gone through separately, and a list
formed of all the memoirs which come within the plan of the proposed
Catalogue. Such list should be in triplicate, one copy for reference, a
second copy to be cut up and arranged for the Catalogue according to
authors' names, and another copy to be cut up and arranged for the

Catalogue according to subjects.

   The Committee have endeavoured to form an estimate of the space whicli
the Catalogue would occupy. The number of papers in a volume of trans-
actions is in general small, but there are works, such as the ' Coniptes Rend us,'

the 'Astronomisciie Nachrichten,' tlie 'Philosophical Magazine,'<!vrc., containing

a very great number of papers, the titles of v.hicii would consequently occupy
a considerable space in the Catalogue. Upon the whole, the Committee con-
sider, that, excluding America, they may estimate the number of papers to be
entered at 125,000; or since each paper would be entered twice, the
number of entries would be 250,000. The number of entries that could
conveniently be brought into a page 4to (double columns), would bi> about
30, so that, according to the above estimate, the Catalogue would occupy ten
quarto volumes of rather more than 800 pages each.

   It appears to the Committee that there should be paid Editors, who should

be familiar with the several great branches respectively of the Sciences to
which the Catalogue relates ; but that the general scheme of arrangement and
details of the Catalogue should be agreed upon between all the Editors, and

that they should be jointly responsible for the execution. It would of course

be necessary that the Editors should have the assistance of an adequate staff

of clerks.

   The principal scientific transactions and works would be accessible in
England at the Library of the British Museum, and the libraries of the
Royal Society and other Philosophical Societies. It would be the duty of
the Editors to ascertain all the different works which ought to be catalogued,
and to procure information as to the contents of such of them as may not

happen to be accessible.
   The Catalogue according to authors' names would be the most readily

executed, and this catalogue, if it should be found convenient, might be first
published. The time of bringing out the two catalogues would of course

depend upon the sufficiency of the assistance at the command of the Editors

should be such, that the complete work might be brought out within a

period not exceeding three years.

        On the Polyhedron of Forces. By J. T, Graves, M.A., F.R.S.

If any number of forces, represented in number and magnitude by the faces of a
polyhedron, and in direction perpendicular to those faces, act upon a point, they
will keep it in equilibrium. The above is the proposition which is called by the
writer " the Polyhedron of Forces." It has probably occurred to many, that the
well-known geometrical representation in magnitude and direction of a system of
balanced forces acting upon a point by the sides of a closed polygon is so simple
and complete that nothing needs to be noted beyond the polygon of forces. What

--is commonly called the parallelopipedon of forces which is the elementary theorem
--in solid space analogous to the parallelogram of forces represents by the" diagonal

of a parallelopipedon the resultant force, which balances the three forces represented
by the areas. But there the separate forces are represented by lines. The writer
was led more than ten years ago to the representation of forces by areas in making

researches respecting complex numbers with a new imaginary symbol. He has
mentioned the result here enunciated to several mathematicians, to whom it has
appeared familiar, and who have believed that it must have been already published
but the writer has searched for it in collections of memoirs and works on statics,
and has been unable to find it in print. He has, accordingly, been advised by a

very learned scientific friend to occupy it, if it has not been already appropriated.
With this view, he takes this opportunity of publishing it to the British Association.

On the Congruence nx^=^n-\-\ (mod/)). By John T. Graves, M.A., F.R.S.

  As is well known to those who have studied foreign works on the theory of num-

bers, the expression

                                              a =: b (mod. c)

--denotes that a 6 divided by c is a whole number. When this relation has place,

a and 6 are said to be congruent with respect to the modulus c, and the relation

itself is called a congruence.

Mr. J. T. Graves shows, from elementary principles of the theory of numbers,

that in the congruence  =Фar n-t-l (mod. ^),

if p be a prime number, and if m be made to assume, in regular ascending order, all
values from 1 top-- 1 inclusive, x will be found to have, in some order or other, all

values from 2 to p inclusive.

   Taking, for example, the modulus 7. the congruence

                     =na; w+l (mod. ^)

is a type of the six congruences (mod. 7),

                        =1 .2 2
                        =2.5 3
                         =3.6 4
                        =4 .3 5
                        =5.4 6

in which, while to n are given successively the values 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 . 5 . 6, we give to x

the corresponding values 2, 5, 6, 3, 4, 7.

   From this simple theorem Mr. J. T. Graves derives Wilson's famous theorem,

namely,

" When ^ is a prime number, we have
                        =1.2.3
                                    (p-- 1)     -1 (mod.p)."

   It is easy to see that the congruence (;)-- l)a;=^ is solved by making ce:=p, and
hence, by the preceding theorem, it is possible to find among the quantities 2.3.4..,

p-- --1, distinct values, including all numbers from 2 top 1, for x^, x^, x^, . . Xp-z,

such that                           =1 .ari
                                    =2.a;3
                                             2                                 (a)
                                             3                                 (b)
                                    =3.Ф3 4

                                    {p--2)xp-2z^p--l.

If, as is allowable, we substitute 1 . x-^ for the factor 2 in the left-hand member of

congruence (a), we get

                                    l.iri.a;j=3                                (c)

   Again, if we substitute 1 . a^i . a?j for the factor 3 in the left-hand member of con-
gruence (b), we get

and proceeding similarly, we find
                        = = --1 .a?i . Xj . iTg . . . arp-2

the last congruence being equivalent to         1 (mod. 7).

Wilson's theorem is thus exhibited as the last of a series of minor theorems.

   In introducing the subject of his paper, Mr. J. T. Graves took occasion to point
out that the late Mr. Peter Barlow's valuable work 'On the Theory of Numbers/ pub-
lished in 1811, which is the only elemenary text-book of note in our language spe-
cially directed to that subject, is not sufficient for the requirements of modern English

students.

--Two Memoirs. I. On a Theorem in Combinations. II. On a particular Class

   of Congruences. By Hbnry M. Jeffery, M.A., Second Master of Pate's
   Grammar School, Cheltenham.

                                                                                                 9

                          AI. Theorem, in Combinations.

   1 . It is proposed to determine the number of combinations of n things
taken severally I, 2, 3, ... n together, where there are p of one sort, q of

another, r of another, &c.

  We will begin by examining a simple case, where there are three quan-

tities, a, b, c.

   The product of the factors

                        +(l-\-ax+a'Jo^){l cx),

or

                         + +l {a c)x-\-(a^+ac)sr-{- a^cx^,

contains the combinations of the three quantities taken 1, 2, 3 severally

together.

   Their numbers in each case are found by equating a, c to unity ; or

                      =;^Ci 2; ^0.2=2; 363=!;

subject to the above restriction, that two of the three quantities are equal.
   The same process of reasoning is easily extended to the general case, as

proposed.

'I'he product of the factors

              (l+ax + a^x'+                    \-aPx'P

           x{\-\-bx+bV+                        +J9a;')

           x(1 + cj? + cVH-                    +c''.c'')

           X

contains the combinations of the n quantities taken severally 1, 2, 3, .. n
together, viz. in the coefficients of j?, x^, x^ . . x^K

The number of the combinations in each case is found by equating a, b,c . .

to unity.

   Hence any particular combination ^C/^ is found by finding the coefficient of

that power of x in the expansion of                                     (A)

   {l+x + x^+.. +xP){l+x + ar+ .. +x9)(l+x + x^+ .. +x'')

whose index is k.

   Or the rule may be otherwise conveniently stated : ,,C^= the coefficient

of x'^ in the expansion of

           l--xP+^ 1-- a;9+╗ l--x''+^

           X X X1 ' 1 ' 1

2. It is important to observe that, subject to these restrictions,

Ц
    as is proved by the circumstance, that x and 1 may be interchanged in the

above formula (A) without altering its value.

                                                          1*

Hence we conclude that there is no necessity for investigating the coeffi-

cients of powers of x beyond -- if ╗ be even, or beyond     if n be odd.

    This consideration vastly diminishes the labour of expansion.

   3. The total number of possible combinations is found by equating x to
unity in the formula (A), and subtracting 1 from the result, since 1 is the
first term in the expansion involving no power of x, and therefore cannot
denote the number of any combination.

   Hence the number required is

                  {p.+ l){q+\){r+\)             -1;

which is a known theorem.
   4. Example : To find the number of combinations that can be formed of

the letters of the word "Notation" taken severally 1, 2, 3, ... 8 together.
   There are two w's, two o's, two ^'s, one a, one i.

The numbers required are found by expanding, at least as far as x*,

         (1 -a^f^\-xy ^ ^^ _^y^i_^y. . (l - ^) -^

                  = (l-3;r'+          ){\-23? + x^)

                  X (1 +5x+\53^-\-Z5x^+ 10x*+. . )

                  = l+5x+lSx^+22x^+26x^+.. ..

The series can now be completed by aid of the theorem

                               =^8-4 8^*:

         l+5a:+13r^ + 22,r3 + 26^H22a;'+13^H5^^ + ;rФ.

The total number of possible combinations

     =5 + 13 + 22 + 26 + 22 + 13 + 5 + 1 = 107 = 3.3.3.2.2-1.

as might have been obtained at once by the formula
                                  (p+l)(q+l)(r+l) ... -I.

This example was selected to contrast the tentative method used in ' Lund's

Companion to Wood's Algebra,' p. Ill, London, 1852, in the particular case

of k=3.

I quote the author's words :

" Here are five different letters : the number of combinations of five letters,

=3 to^gether, where no letter recurs  5x4 =10.
                                      1x2

" Also there are two Ф's, two o's, and two <'s, each of which pairs may be

combined with each of the other four letters, and form four combinations of

three, making altogether 3 x 4=; 12 such combinations where the letters recur,

                  и.и number required =10+ 12=:22."

   5. To find the number of permutations of n things taken 1, 2, 3, . . Ф
together, when n consists of groups of identical quantities, p of one sort, q of

another, r of another, &c.

   In the following solution we shall denote ^Pj, 2P2. и и r^r by powers of P,

viz. P, P-, ... P'', and subject P to the laios of indices.
   In order to see more clearly the method and notation that will be adopted,

let us examine the familiar case of four different quantities, a, b, c, d. The

permutations are contained in the coefficients of the several powers of x in

the expansion of

                  + + + +(1 Pa,r)(l P6x)(l Pcci-)(1 Prfx),

                + (abc+abd+acd+ bcd)F^x^ + aicrfPV.

   The number of the permutations in each case is given by the coefficients
of the several powers of x in the expansion of

            V V+ + +( 1 P^)' or 1 4Pa: 6P + 4P + PV.

That is,

        4Pj = 4P=4: 4P^=6P2=12: 4P3=4P3=24 : 4P4=P*=24.

   Next consider the case of a, a, c, d.
   The permutations are contained in the coefficients of the powers of x in
the expansion of

            fl + a.'Px^- -^.PvVl + c.PajXl + rf.Pa;),

or

                \ + {a + c+d)'Px+(ac-\-ad+cd+ ^--\V^3^

       + f^!lI▒^+Фcrf)pV+ tSl PV.

          V 1.2 / 1.2

The justice of this conclusion may be seen by examining the mode of for-

mation of each coefficient.

The number is found by equating a, c, d to unity

Hence        1 + 3Pa; + |PV + 2PV + iPV.

             4P, = 3:4P2=7:4P3=12:4P4=I2.

The general theorem may be expressed as follows :

       nPj.= the coefficient of a;* in the expansion of

where it must be observed that P and its various powers have no meaning,

until the expansion has been effected.
    7. Ex. "Notation."

   The number of permutations in each case is contained in the expansion of

In this case, therefore,                8P5=1110=                  8?,= 2790 ;

           =hP, 5040: 8Pg=5040.

   To test these results, examine gPg.
   There are five different letters, n, o, t, a, i, whose permutations taken three

together ^=- 60.

   There are twelve groups of the form " nno," each of which may be per-
muted three times, or there are thirty-six permutations of this form. In all
60-1-36=96.

    8. It is presumed that a general method is preferable to the tentative pro-
cess, -which requires considerable acuteness in detecting the several groups,
and leaves a liability to error after all. Hence it is hoped that this theorem,
which supplies a desideratum in every-day algebra, may be worthy of the

attention of the Meeting.

          On a New Method of Treating the Doctrine of Parallel Lines.
                                       By Prof. Stevellt.

   The author stated that from the days of Euclid to the present, all geometricians
admitted that Euclid's twelfth axiom was a property to be proved, and not an axiom
to be assumed as self-evident ; but hitherto no satisfactory and sufficiently element-
arv proof of it had been adduced. He then showed that, by defining parallel lines
to be "when two lines in the same plane were both perpendicular to the same line,
they should be called parallel," all the properties of parallel fines as proved by
Euclid could be shown to belong to these, by two supplementary propositions. The
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  9

second of these was, that the line joining any two points along parallel lines,
assumed at an equal distance from the line to which both are perpendicular, formed
right angles with each of the parallel lines. The author then went through the
series of geometrical proofs, which would, however, be unsuited to our report, con-

cluding with the proof of the twelfth axiom of Euclid.

Models to illustrate a new Method of teaching Perspective. By H. R. Twining.

   The object of this communication is to explain the principles of perspective in
such a manner as may enable those who draw to distribute their objects not only in
a correct manner, but in one agreeable to the eye. The method aiFords an intermediary
step between those rules which are demonstrated by diagrams in the usual treatises,
and those appearances which characterize natural objects themselves. The chief dif-
ficulty in enabling an audience to follow out the principles of perspective when applied
to solid objects is, that every individual sees these from a different position ; so that
such an explanation of the effect observed as is adapted to one individual cannot suit
another. Mr. Twining's method aims at overcoming this difficulty by placing an
image (with which each individual is supposed to identify himself) in the exact spot
which the observer ought to occupy, and which serves to mark the true focus of the

picture.

     On various Phenomena of Refraction through Semi-Lenses producing Anomalies
             in the Illusion of Stereoscopic Images. By A. Claudet, F.R.S.

         The paper had for its object to explain the cause of the illusion of curvature given
     to pictures representing flat surfaces, when examined in the refracting or semilen-
      ticular stereoscope. The author showed that all vertical lines seen through prisms
       or semi-lenses are bent, presenting their concave side to the thin edge of the prism,
      and as the two photographic pictures are bent in the same manner and by the same
       cause, the inevitable result of their coalescence in the stereoscope is a concave sur-
      face produced by the necessity of converging the optic axes more to unite the ends and
      less to unite the centres of the two curved lines ; more convergence giving the illusion
      of nearer distance, and less convergence of further distance. The only means to
      avoid this defect is to examine the two pictures in order to employ the centre of
      the lenses, which do not bend straight lines ; but as the centre does not refract
      laterally the two images, their coincidence cannot take place without placing the
     optical axis in such a position that they are nearly parallel, as if we were looking
      at the moon, or a very distant object. This is an operation not very easy at the first
      attempt, but which a little practice will teach us to perform. Persons capable

   --of using such a stereoscope will see the pictures more perfect, and all objects in

     their natural shape. Mr. Claudet presented to the Meeting a stereoscope made
     on this principle, and many of the members present could see perfectly well with
      it. The author explained the cause of another defect which is very often noticed
      in examining stereoscopic pictures, viz. that the subject seems in some cases to

   --come out of the openings of the mountings, and in some others to recede from

      behind, this last effect being more favourable and more artistic. Mr. Claudet
     recommended photographers when mounting their pictures to take care that the
      opening should have their correspondent vertical sides less distant than any two
      correspondent points of the first plane of the pictures, which could be easily done
     by means of a pair of compasses, measuring those respective distances. To
      illustrate the phsenomenon of vertical lines, bent by prisms, forming by coalescence
      concave surfaces, Mr. Claudet stated that if holding in each hand one prism, the
      two prisms having their thin edges towards each other, we look at the window from
     the opposite end of the room, we see first two windows with their vertical Unes

k
--10 REPORT 1856.

bent in contrary directions ; but by inclining gradually the optical axes, we can
converge them until the two images coalesce, and we see only one window; as soon
as they coincide the lateral curvature of the vertical lines ceases, and they are bent
projectively from back to front : we have then the illusion of a window concave

towards the room, such as it would appear reflected by a concave mirror.

On some Dichromatic Phcenomena among Solutions, and the means of representing
                    them. By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S.

This paper was an extension of Sir John Herschel's observations on dichromatism,

that property whereby certain bodies appear of a different colour according to the

quantity seen through. It depends generally on the less rapid absorption of the red

Aray as it penetrates a substance.  dichromatic solution was examined by placing

it in a wedge-shaped glass- trough, held in such a position that a slit in a window-

shutter was seen traversing the varying thicknesses of the liquid. The diversely

coloured line of light thus produced was analysed by a prism ; and the resulting

spectrum was represented in a diagram by means of coloured chalks on black paper,

the true position of the apparent colours being determined by the fixed lines of the

spectrum. In this way the citrate and comenamate of iron, sulphate of indigo,

litmus in various conditions, cochineal, and chromium, and cobalt salts were examined

--and represented. Among the more notable results were the following : A base,

such as chromic oxide, produces very nearly the same spectral image with whatever

acid it may be combined, although the salts may appear very different in colour to

the unaided eye. Citrate of iron appears green, brown, or red, according to the

quantity seen through. It transmits the red ray most easily, then the orange, then

the green, while it cuts off entirely the more refrangible half of the spectrum.

Neutral litmus appears blue or red, according to the strength or depth of the solu-

tion. Alkalies cause a great development of the blue ray ; acids cause a like increase

of the orange, while the minimum of luminosity is altered to a position much nearer

the blue. Boracic acid causes a development of the violet. Alkaline litmus was

exhibited so strong that it appeared red, and sUghtly acid litmus so dilute that it

looked bluish purple ; indeed, on account of the easy transmissibility of the orange
ray through an acid solution, the apparent paradox was maintained that a large

amount of alkaline litmus is of a purer red than acid litmus itself. Another kind

of dichromatism was examined, dependent not on the actual quantity of coloured

material, but on the relative proportion of the solvent, and diagrams of the changing

appearances of sulphocyanide of iron, of chloride of copper, and of chloride of cobalt

were exhibited.

              On the Stratified Appearance of the Electrical Discharge.

                         By W. R. Grove, M.A., F.R.S.

   Mr. Grove communicated some additional facts connected with a phaenomenon
first observed and published by him in the 'Philosophical Transactions' for 1852,

viz. the striated or stratified appearance in the electric discharge in rarefied gases

and vapours, particularly that of phosphorus. M. Ruhmkorff, M. Quet, and
Dr. Robinson had, subsequently to Mr. Grove, experimented on the subject. No sa-
tisfactory rationale of it has hitherto been given. Mr. Grove has, however, observed
that the mode of breaking contact has a marked influence on the phaenomenon, which
would lead to the belief that it is due to the intermittent character of the discharges.
If,for instance, the arm of thecontact-breaker be made to rest on a slight spring placed
underneath it, the bands become narrower. If a single breach of contact be effected,
most observers have remarked that the effect is still perceptible ; but it is very diffi-
cult to effect a single breach of contact. The fusion of the metals at the point of
contact, with the vibration accompanying the movement, occasions a double or
triple disruption. The best mode is to place two stout copper wires across each
other, and with a firm hand draw one over the other, until the end of the former
parts company with the latter ; when this is well done the striae are, in the majority
of cases, not observed. Of all the substances which had been tried, the vapour of
phosphoiTis succeeds best, and with this is seen a remarkable effect on the powder
or smoke of allotropic phosphorus (which is always formed when the striae are
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  11

observed) : this smoke traverses from pole to pole, from the negative to the positive

--side, showing, unless there be some latent optical deception, a mechanical effect of

the discharge under the circumstances. The phsenomenon was exhibited to the
members of the Section in the committee-room, which had been darkened for the

purpose.

On the Law of Electrical and Magnetic Force. By Sir W. S. Harris, F.R.S.

   The author prefaced the exposition of the views he himself had adopted, after
elaborate experimental research on the subject, by stating that the discovery of the
beautiful and comprehensive law of universal gravitation by Newton had predisposed
all physical inquirers to entertain the notion that every other force associated with
ordinary matter was subject to a similar law. The forces of electricity and magnetism
were especially considered as coming under a like law, and a great variety of expe-
rimental inquiries were instituted to verify the conjecture. Cavendish, after QEpinus,
was certainly the first philosopher who investigated experimentally and threw light
on this question. This appears by his celebrated paper in the ' Philosophical Trans-
actions' for 1772, and likewise by his unpublished manuscripts, which had descended
to the Earl of Burlington, and had been placed by that nobleman in the hands of the
author ; and, he might add in passing, were open to the inspection of any inquirer
engaged in these researches, and contained matter of the most important kind. The
author then pointed out several well-known and acknowledged truths in these
sciences which were due to the researches of Cavendish. He then pointed out the
influence which the researches of Coulomb had exercised on the universal philoso-

phic world, particularly after the writings of the celebrated Poisson, Laplace, Biot.
and others had given form and currency to his views and principles. Such a
galaxy of eminent names, and so wide a reception of Coulomb's theoretical views,

the author considered to be calculated to discountenance and discourage much critical
inquiry as to their soundness, and to immerse us in a kind of philosophical ortho-
doxy very unfavourable to a more complete knowledge of these unseen, yet astonishing
powers of Nature which we daily experience. The author then went on to illustrate

the law of the inverse square of the distance as relating to forces emanating from

one central point and to other emanations from a centre, and to point out how far

this might safely be relied upon as applicable to the electrical and magnetic forces
of attraction and repulsion ; and stated that the object of the present communication,
which the author submitted with all due diffidence, was to investigate the physical

--condition under which these forces manifest themselves, what are the general laws
--of the operation of such forces, how far we may safely consider them as central

forces, such as gravity, or whether they are to be considered more in the light of
forces, operating between surfaces distinctive in their character and in their ordinary

relations to common matter. He then pointed out one essentially distinctive cha-
racter of these forces. In gravitation, the attracted body, as far as we can observe,

remains in the same physical condition before and during all the changes of distance
and force to which the bodies are naturally subjected. But in the phaenomena of
electrical and magnetic attraction and of repulsion, the very first step was that the
body acted upon had its physical condition changed ; and this change again, by a
kind of reflex influence, affected what had been the instant before the physical
condition of the body producing the change ; and thus, during the action and its
changes, new physical conditions of both had to be investigated and taken into con-
sideration, that is, if we wish truly to interpret the facts. The author then, with
well-arranged apparatus, proceeded to illustrate, by some striking experiments, both
electrical and magnetic, the truth and importance of these general views: he endea-
voured to explain the peculiar electrical conditions under which the forces of elec-
tricity and magnetism might be expected to vary in the inverse duplicate ratio of the
distances, but which conditions being interfered with, other laws of force might
become developed, as found by many eminent philosophers of the last century, dis-
tinguished by their great skill in experimental physics. The author concluded by
some observations on the use of the proof plane and the torsion balance, and showed
with what great caution the proof plane should be applied as a means of deducing
 results to serve as data for mathematical analysis.

          On the Unequal Sensibility of the Foramen Centrale to Light of
                       different Colours. By J. C. Maxwell.

  When observing the spectrum formed by looking at a long vertical slit through a
simple prism, I noticed an elongated dark spot running up and down in the blue,

and following the motion of the eye as it moved up and down the spectrum, but
refusing to pass out of the blue into the other colours. It was plain that the spot
belonged both to the eye and to the blue part of the spectrum. The result to which
I have come is, that the appearance is due to the yellow spot on the retina, com-
monly called the Foramen Centrale of Soemmering. The most convenient method of
observing the spot is by presenting to the eye in not too rapid succession, blue and
yellow glasses, or, still better, allowing blue and 5'ellow papers to revolve slowly
before the eye. In this way the spot is seen in the blue. It fades rapidly, but is
renewed every time the yellow comes in to relieve the effect of the blue. By using a
Nicol's prism along with this apparatus, the brushes of Haidinger are well seen in
connexion with the spot, and the fact of the brushes being the spot analysed by po-
larized light becomes evident. If we look steadily at an object behind a series
of bright bars which move in front of it, we shall see a curious bending of the bars
as they come up to the place of the yellow spot. The part which comes over the
spot seems to start in advance of the rest of the bar, and this would seem to indicate
a greater rapidity of sensation at the yellow spot than in the surrounding retina.
But I find the experiment diflScult, and I hope for better results from more accurate

observers.

 On a Method of Drawing the Theoretical Forms 0/ Faraday's Lines of Force
                         without Calculation. By J. C. Maxwell.

  The method applies more particularly to those cases in which the lines are entirely
parallel to one plane, such as the lines of electric currents in a thin plate, or those
round a system of parallel electric currents. In such cases, if we know the forms
of the lines of force in any two cases, we may combine them by simple addition of
the functions on which the equations of the lines depend. Thus the system of hues
in a uniform magnetic field is a series of parallel straight lines at equal intervals, and
that for an infinite straight electric current perpendicular to the paper is a series of
concentric circles whose radii are in geometric progression. Having drawn these two
sets of lines on two separate sheets of paper, and laid a third piece above, draw a
third set of lines through the intersections of the first and second sets. This will
be the system of lines in a uniform field disturbed by an electric current, llie most
interesting cases are those of uniform fields disturbed by a small magnet. If we
draw a circle of any diameter with the magnet for centre, and join those points in
which the circle cuts the lines of force, the straight lines so drawn will be parallel and
equidistant ; and it is easily shown that they represent the actual lines of force in a

paramagnetic, diamagnetic, or crystallized body, according to the nature of the ori-

ginal lines, the size of the circle, &c. No one can study Faraday's researches without

wishing to see the forms of the lines of force. This method, therefore, by which
they may be easily drawn, is recommended to the notice of electrical students.

     On the Theory of Compound Colours with reference to Mixtures of Blue
                           and Yellow Light. By J. C. Maxwell.

   When we mix together blue and yellow paint, we obtain green paint. This fact
is well known to all who have ever handled colours ; and it is universally admitted

that blue and yellow make green. Red, yellow, and blue, being the primary colours
among painters, green is regarded as a secondary colour, arising from the mixture of
blue and yellow. Newton, however, found that the green of the spectrum was not
the same thing as the mixture of two colours of the spectrum, for such a mixture
could be separated by the prism, while the green of the spectrum resisted further de-
composition. But still it was believed that yellow and blue would make a green,
though not that of the spectrum As far as I am aware, the first experiment on the
subject is that of M. Plateau, who, before 1819, made a disc with alternate sectors
of Prussian blue and gamboge, and observed that, when spinning, the resultant

                                                                                                                                           J
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                      13

tint was not green, but a neutral gray, inclining sometimes to yellow or blue, but
never to green. Prof. J. D. Forbes of Edinburgh made similar experiments in

1849, with the same result. Prof. Helmholtz of Konigsberg, to whom we owe the

most complete investigation on visible colour, has given the true explanation of this
phsenomenon. The result of mixing two coloured powders is not by any means the
same as mixing the beams of light which flow from each separately. In the latter
case we receive all the light which comes either from the one powder or the other.
In the former, much of the light coming from one powder falls on particles of the
other, and we receive only that portion which has escaped absorption by one or other.

Thus the light coming from a mixture of blue and yellow powder, consists partly
of light coming directly from blue particles or yellow particles, and partly of light

acted on by both blue and yellow particles. This latter light is green, since the blue
stops the red, yellow, and orange, and the yellow stops the blue and violet. I have

--made experiments on the mixture of blue and yellow light by rapid rotation, by

combined reflexion and transmission, by viewing them out of focus, in stripes, at
a great distance, by throwing the colours of the spectrum on a screen, and by
receiving them into the eye directly; and I have arranged a portable apparatus by
which any one may see the result of this or any other mixture of the colours of the
spectrum. In all these cases blue and yellow do not make green. I have also made
experiments on the mixture of coloured powders. Those which I used principally
were "mineral blue" (from copper) and "chrome-yellow." Other blue and yellow
pigments gave curious results, but it was more difficult to make the mixtures, and
the greens were less uniform in tint. The mixtures of these colours were made
by weight, and were painted on discs of paper, which were afterwards treated in

the manner described in my paper "On Colour as perceived by the Eye," in the

' Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,' vol. xxi. part 2. The visible

--effect of the colour is estimated in terms of the standard-coloured papers : ver-

milion (V), ultramarine (U), and emerald-green (E). The accuracy of the results,

and their significance can be best understood by referring to the paper before

Ymentioned. I shall denote mineral blue by B, and chrome-yellow by ; and B3 Yj

means a mixture of three parts blue and five parts yellow.

   The columns V, U, E give the proportions of the standard colours which
are equivalent to 100 of the given colour ; and the sum of V, U, E gives a co-

efficient, which gives a general idea of the brightness. It will be seen that the first
admixture of yellow diminishes the brightness of the blue. The negative values of

U indicate that a mixture of V, U, and E cannot be made equivalent to the given

colour. The experiments from which these results were taken had the negative
values trEinsferred to the other side of the equation. They were all made by means
of the colour-top, and were verified by repetition at different times. It may be
necessary to remark, in conclusion, with reference to the mode of registering visible
colours in terms of three arbitrary standard colours, that it proceeds upon that theory

of three primary elements in the sensation of colour, which treats the investigation of
the laws of visible colour as a branch of human physiology, incapable of being

deduced from the laws of light itself, as set forth in physical optics. It takes advan-

tage of the methods of optics to study vision itself ; and its appeal is not to physical

principles, but to our consciousness of our own sensations.

On the Form of Lightning. By James Nasmyth, F.R.A.S.

Mr Nasmyth said, that, observing that the form usually attributed to lightning by
                                                          that which he had observed as
painters and in works of art was very different from      .t. He believed the error of the
exhibited in nature, he was induced to call attention to
artists originated in the form given to the thunderbolt in the hand of Jupiter as sculp-

tured by the early Greeks.

The form of lightning as
exhibited in nature was

simply an irregular curved

line, most generally shoot-

ing from the earth below to

the cloud above, and often

continued from the cloud

downwards agai n to another

distant part of the earth.

This appearance, he con-

ceived, was the result of the

rapid passage of a point of

light which constituted the
true lightniug, leaving on

the eye the impression of

the path it traced. In very
intense lightning, he had

also observed offshoots of

an arborescent form to pro-

ceed, at several places, from

the primary track of the

flash. But in no instance
among the many thunder-

storms whose progress he

had most attentively watch-

ed, had he ever observed

such forms of lightning as

that usually represented in

works of art ; in all such,
the artists invariably adopt
a conventional form, name-
ly, that of a zigzag com-

bination of straight lines as

indicated in fig 1 ; whereas

the true natural form of a

primitive flash of lightning

appears to Mr. Nasmyth

On Fresnel's Formulmfor Reflected and Refracted Light. By the Rev. Baden
     Powell, M.A., F.R.S. Src, Savilian Professor of Geometry, Oxford.

   The author having recently published in the 'Philosophical Magazine' (July and
August 1856) a detailed review of the various questions respecting the rfemores<ra^zo╗

of these well-known and important formulae, and their applications, is anxious to
put before the Section a short summary of the whole case, and to elicit, if possible,
a more complete discussion of the questions arising out of it, more especially as some
views recently taken would seem calculated to set aside the whole reasoning hitherto
adopted on the subject, and to involve the whole application and interpretation of
the formulas in doubt.

   The whole of these investigations is founded on the following principles :

   (1) The law of vis viva (m and m, being the simultaneously vibrating masses of
aether without and within the medium ; h, h', h, the amplitudes of the incident, re-
flected, and refracted rays),

                 >Ф(A2-- A'2)=m;A,^

   (2) The law of equivalent vibrations as given by Maccullagh (i and r being the
angles of incidence and refraction, I the plane of incidence),

     h-\-h'=.hf yWiraiWons perpendicular to I.

                 cosr .

(3)  A+ft --ftj  и sihraXioas parallel to I.

(4) Another form of this law, the second case of which was adopted by Fresoel

     h--h'=:h,                           perpendicular to I.

     -- ----cosr
(5)  h h'z=h     -.                      parallel to I.

(6) MaccuUagh's hypothesis of equal densities, giving

                                     m sin 2i

                                                       m, sin 2r

(7) Fresnel's hypothesis of increased density in the more refractive medium, giving

(8) MaccuUagh's hypothesis of vibrations parallel to the plane of polarization.

(9) Fresnel's hypothesis of vibrations perpendicular to the plane of polarization.

From these assumptions are directly deduced formulas whose general types are

                 --h! sin (i r)                                           (^^

=Vwhence h, and k, follow from (1) by (2), (3), or (4), (5). Also becomes 0, and

changes sign at the incidence of polarization.

   The several hypotheses give these formulas with different signs, and consequently
with different values of A, k,.

   Thus, proceeding in all cases on the principle of vis viva, and that of the mecha-

--nical equivalence of the incident, reflected, and refracted vibrations, on the hypo-
-- --thesis of equal densities, of vibrations parallel to the plane of polarization, and of
--Maccullagh's law of equivalence, vie have Maccullagh's formulas (H) and (K). (A.)

   On the hypothesis of increased density, of vibrations perpendicular to polariza-
tion, and Maccullagh's law of equivalence, we have Fresnel's formula (H), but a for-

mula (K) differing from Fresnel's in the signs. (B.)

   On the same hypotheses, but taking that form of the law of equivalence which
Fresnel adopted in one instance, we have (H) differing from Fresnel's in sign, and

(K) the same as Fresnel's. (C.)
   The theoretical principles seem as yet to furnish no guide to a choice between

these assumptions ; but the results of experiment must be appealed to.
   The only known experimental results which bear upon the question between these

several formula and the hypotheses on which they are deduced, are
    I. Professor Stokes's result of the change of plane of vibration and polarization in

diffraction, which sets aside absolutely the hypothesis of vibrations parallel to the
plane of polarization, and by consequence Maccullagh's formulae (A), and the hypo-
thesis of equal densities on which they are founded.

   II. The result of Arago, Fresnel and Brewster, as to the change of plane of polari-
zation by reflexion ; the new plane being, at small incidences, on the opposite side of

the plane of incidence to that of original polarization ; while after passing the inci-
dence of complete polarization it comes to the same side. This requires formulas

Vwhich give h' and of opposite signs at small incidences, and of the same sign after

the polarizing incidence, which is only the case with Fresnel's original formulas
(B, a.) and (C, /3), and excludes those on the other hypotheses, (R, /3), and (C, u).

   III. The result of Dr. Lloyd from his interference fringes, where at the extreme
oblique incidence the incident and reflected ray are in opposite phases ; this requires
both h' and h, as also Ic and V, to be of opposite signs at great incidences, which
agrees only with Fresnel's original formulas (B, a) and (C, /3).

   But these inferences assume the correctness of the reasoning on the symbols as
hitherto adopted, both by the original investigators referred to, and also in the ele-
mentary treatises of Mr. Airy and others. Some suggestions lateh^ made in order
to bring the other formulas into accordance with the facts, can only do so by setting
aside the validity of the entire reasoning just referred to. These suggestions turn
on the geometrical change in position which (in the case of vibrations parallel to the
plane of incidence) the directions of the vibrations undergo, with the change of posi-
tion of the ray, in passing from small to large incidences, so that if they accord in
the first instance they will (from this cause alone) be opposed in the second.

   On the other hand, the original formulas of Fresnel are still deficient in respect

to their direct deduction from any one of the above-mentioned hypotheses ; they will
only follow from partially adopting two of them, viz. (B, oi) and (C, /3).

  A suggestion for deducing them on another principle has been since made by the

author in the ' Philosophical Magazine,' October 1856.

   On a Modification of the Maynooth Cast Iron Battery. By W. Symons.
   A recent paper by Professor Callan in the ' Philosophical Magazine ' on a cast iron

batter)' which he states to be equal in power to Grove's nitric acid battery, will
probably induce many persons to adopt this very cheap but cumbrous metal. The
battery now exhibited is an improvement on one published by the author in the ' Phar-
maceutical Journal ' for February 1853, and its recommendations are compactness, as
it can be moved as one mass ; and simplicity and economy of construction, as one
wooden screw is sufficient for 10 or 12 pairs. The construction was minutely de-
scribed, and two arrangements of plates were shown, one adapted for a Wedgewood
trough with cast-iron plates on each side of each zinc plate, and the other fitted up
in a similar manner to a battery described by Martyn Roberts, in which he proposes to
use both sides of both plates : such an arrangement may perhaps be advantageous
where the resistance is very small, but from a few experiments with the battery shown,
it appears to be far from economical where the resistance is equal to that required for
the decomposition of water. Six pairs on each plan were fitted up with similar plates
       TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                          l*J

and with acid of the same strength, but the arrangement in which the pairs were
isolated in a Wedgewood trough, liberated three or four times tbe amount of gases
in the voltameter, as the arrangement on Martyn Roberts' plan. The battery, when
arranged as the author proposes, will be one compact mass, which can be readily
moved in and out of the cells ; this will probably more than compensate for the loss
by the action of the acid on the iron surface not exposed to the zinc, as the battery
need only be kept in the acid when actually at work ; and this loss may perhaps be
further prevented by covering the outside of the iron with a resinous mixture ; but

should the cast-iron cell suggested by Callan be preferred, they can be easily cast with

the addition required in this arrangement. As cast-iron plates 5 inches square can
be procured for 2d. each at any foundry, and no binding screws are required, this
battery will probably be found much cheaper and quite as efficient as any published,
and especially adapted for experimentalists who make their own apparatus, who will

know how to appreciate the cheap and easy method for making the connexions. A

more detailed account, with an engraving of this battery, may be seen in the
' Chemist ' for November 1856.

On Dellman's Method of observing Atmospheric Electricity. By

           Professor William Thomson, M.A., F.R.S., Glasgow.

--Extract from letter addressed to General Sabine : " During my recent visit to

Creuznach I became acquainted with Mr. Dellman of that place, who makes meteoro-

logical, chiefly electrical, observations for the Pnassian Government, and I had oppor-

tunities of witnessing his method of electrical observation . It consists in using a copper

ball about 6 inches diameter, to carry away an electrical effect from a position about
two yards above the roof of his house, depending simply on the atmospheric ' poten-

tial ' at the point to which the centre of the ball is sent ; and it is exactly the method

of the ' carrier ball ' by which Faraday investigated the atmospheric potential in the

neighbourhood of a rubbed stick of shell-lac, and other electrified bodies (' Experi-

mental Researches,' Series XI. 1837) . The whole process only differs from Faraday's

in not employing the carrier ball directly, as the repeller in a Coulomb-electrometer,

but putting it into communication with the conductor of a separate electrometer of
peculiar construction. The collecting part of the apparatus is so simple and easily

managed that an amateur could, for a few shillings, set one up on his own house, if

at all suitable as regards roof and windows ; and, if provided with a suitable electro-
meter, could make observations in atmospheric electricity with as much ease as ther-

mometric or barometric observations. The electrometer used by Mr. Dellman is of
his own construction (described in Poggendorff's 'Annalen,' 1853, vol. Ixxxix., also

vol. Ixxxv.), and it appears to be very satisfactory in its operation. It is, I believe,

essentially more accurate and sensitive than Peltier's, and it has a great advantage in

affording a very easy and exact method for reducing its indications to absolute measure.
I was much struck with the simplicity and excellence of Mr. Dellman's whole system

of observation on atmospheric electricity; and it has occurred to me that the Kew Com-

mittee might be disposed to adopt it, if determined to carry out electrical observations.

When I told Mr. Dellman that I intended to make a suggestion to this effect, he at once
offered to have an electrometer, if desired, made under his own care. I wish also to

suggest two other modes of observing atmospheric electricity which have occurred to
me, as possessing each of them some advantages over any of the systems hitherto fol-

lowed. In one of these I propose to have an uninsulated cylindrical iron funnel, about

7 inches diameter, fixed to a height of two or three yards above the highest part of

the building, and a light moveable continuation (like the telescope funnel of a

steamer) of a yard and a half or two yards more, which can be let down or pushed

up at pleasure. Insulated by supports at the top of the fixed part of the funnel, I
would have a metal stem carrying a ball like Dellman's, standing to such a height

that it can be covered by a hinged lid on the top of the moveable joint of the funnel,
when the latter is pushed up ; and a fine wire fixed to the lower end of the insulated

stem, and hanging down, in the axis of the funnel to the electrometer. When the

apparatus is not in use, the moveable joint would be kept at the highest, with its lid
down, and the ball uninsulated. To make an observation, the ball would be insu-

lated, the lid turned up rapidly, and the moveable joint carrying it let down, an

 operation which could be effected in a few seconds by a suitable mechanism. The
 electrometer would immediately indicate an inductive electrification simply propor-
 tional to the atmospheric potential at the position occupied by the centre of the ball,
 and would continue to indicate at each instant the actual atmospheric potential,
 however variable, as long as no sensible electrification or diselectrification has taken
place through imperfect insulation or convection by particles of dust Or currents of
air (probably for a quarter or a half of an hour, when care is taken to keep the
 insulation in good order). This might be the best form of apparatus for making
 observations in the presence of thunder-clouds. But I think the best possible plan
in most respects, if it turns out to be practicable, of which I can have little doubt,
 will be to use, instead of the ordinary fixed insulated conductor with a point, a fixed
 conductor of similar form, but hollow, and containing within itself an apparatus for
making hydrogen, and blowing small soap-bubbles of that gas from a fine tube ter-
minating as nearly as may be in a point, at a height of a few yards in the air. With
this arrangement the insulation would only need to be good enough to make the loss
of a charge by conduction very slow in comparison with convective loss by the
bubbles ; so that it would be easy to secure against any sensible error from defective
insulation. If 100 or 200 bubbles, each tV inch in diameter, are blown from the

top of the conductor per minute, the electrical potential in its interior will very rapidly,
follow variations of the atmospheric potential, and would be at any instant the same

as the mean for the atmosphere during some period of a few minutes preceding.
The action of a simple point is (as, I suppose, is generally admitted) essentially
unsatisfactory, and as nearly as possible nugatory in its results. I am not aware
how flame has been found to succeed, but I should think not well in the circumstances
of atmospheric observations, in which it is essentially closed in a lantern; and I
cannot see on any theoretical ground how its action in these circumstances can be
perfect, like that of the soap-bubbles. I intend to make a trial of the practicability
of blowing the bubbles ; and if it proves satisfactory, there cannot be a doubt of the

--availability of the system for atmospheric observations."
   [Addition, Feb. 1857.] The author has now made various trials on the last-men-
tioned part of his proposal, and he has not succeeded in finding any practicable self-
regulating apparatus for blowing bubbles and detaching them one by one from the
tube. He has seen reason to doubt whether it will be possible to get bubbles so small

as those proposed above, to rise at all ; but he has not been led to believe that, if it is
thought worth while to try, it will be found impracticable to construct a self-acting
apparatus which will regularly blow and discharge separately, bubbles of considerably
larger diameter, and so to secure the advantages mentioned, although with a pro-
portionately larger consumption of the gas.

   On the other hand, he finds that, by the aid of an extremely sensitive electrometer

which he has recently constructed, he will be able, in all probability with great ease
and at very small cost, to bring into practice the first of his two plans, constructed
on a considerably smaller scale as regards height than proposed in the preceding
statement.

On Printing Photographs, ivith suggestions for introducing Clouds and Artistic
                               Effects. By E. Vivian, M.A.

   The object of this paper was to point out the deficiencies in the chiaroscuro of
photographic pictures, occasioned by the discrepancy between the actinic and the
visual ray, and also the importance of introducing artistic effects in accordance with

the laws of composition.
   The former of these is well known, yellow being the focus of light in the scale oi

colour, whilst it is the darkest in the photographic image, the greatest intensity of
chemical action in the spectrum being in the violet, and even beyond the range of light.

The defects of composition in ordineiry nature are not so generally admitted, but, to
the artist's eye, few scenes are capable of producing a good picture, without, at
least, the concentration and balance of light and shadow, which are only seen under
rare and peculiarly favourable circumstances. Attention to this latter point is the
more necessary in most photographic pictures from their reduced size, which
requires them to be viewed at a distance from the eye, much beyond the technical
                      TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                    19

" distance of the picture," the rays thus entering the retina from all parts at nearly

the same angle, instead of those from the centre being full and direct, and those

from the extremities weakened by obliquity, as would be the case if the picture were

the size of life.

The remedy proposed was the employment of a second artificial negative, similar to

the tint stone in double lithography. In preparing this, a sheet of transparent tracing

paper is laid upon the original photograph, and all those portions which are to form

the high lights are stopped out with opake colour, the clouds being formed with

washes by a camel-hair brush, and the fine tracery of architecture, &c. with a reed,

pen or crowquill. Whilst the positive impression is still sensitive, this tint pE^per is

to be accurately fitted on, either by the eye, or points in the frame, and exposed

again to the light, until flat tones of the requisite depth are produced. The sky may

be graduated by moving a shade over the surface, allowing the horizon to be least

exposed, the effect of which is to produce the utmost delicacy in the force of the

Aclouds as they recede in the perspective, however rudely drawn.       still more per-

fect method is to commence with a good negative photograph of' natural clouds,

proceeding as before with the details of the picture.

The first object should be to throw a flat tint over all those portions which, from

being blue, have printed too light, as the sky, slate roofs, and all polished surfaces,

as water, leaves of evergreens, &c., which reflect the blue of the sky. This alone

will often produce a pleasing picture from a very unsatisfactory negative, light objects

relieved by a dark sky, and the deep tones of water, especially in sea pieces, being

amongst the most effective objects in nature, but which are quite lost in ordinary

photography. The effect must be left to the skill of the artist, shadows of clouds, with

the toning down of obtrusive or offensive features being amongst the most obvious

means employed to improve the composition, without interfering with the truth of

the original outlines. The most powerful effects of moonlight, sunrise, or sunset
may thus be produced, with reflexions in still water, or the gleams and ripple of a

breeze ; the foam and sharp lines of a cataract may, by stopping out high lights on
the original negative, be also substituted for the dull mass which ordinarily repre-

sents falling water.

The difiicultj' of reversing the lights of the clouds by using dark colour, may, if

preferred, be avoided by substituting Chinese white tinged with yellow, the trans-

parent paper being laid upon the dark sky of the negative.

  A tint paper thus produced may be used for any number of impressions, and, if

the details of the picture are satisfactory, skies alone may be adapted to many

different negatives, especially if drawn of more than the requisite extent, so as to

apply such portion as is suitable to the composition of each picture.

Many other suggestions were offered, such as inverting the negative to produce

reflexions, when taken from the level of the water, the introduction of foregrounds,

cattle, &c., by using both the object and the matrix from which it was cut, so that
the lines should exactly coincide. Methods were also shown by which the printing
of parts of a photograph may be retarded so as to bring up the more opake portions.

The most effectual of these was to attach a sheet of transparent tracing paper over

the back of the negative and to stump over the weaker parts, so as when seen by

transmitted light the whole should be in due gradation. The dispersion of ray

through the thickness of the glass is found sufiicient to prevent any trace of thia

artificial shading. With paper negatives the same result may also be produced by

partial waxing.

On the Construction and Use of an Instrument for determining the Value of
   Intermittent or Alternating Electric Currents for purposes of Practical

   Telegraphy. By Wildman Whitehouse.

   In the prosecution of some electrical studies, requiring an estimate of the vdues
of different magneto-electric currents, Mr. Whitehouse found that the ordinary gal-
vanometer was totally inadequate to indicate the required results.

   However suitable that instrument might be for a continuous or voltaic current,
and within a very limited range, yet the problem before him involved the numerical
estimate of currents of the widest range and of the shortest duration.

                                                                                               2*
--30 REPORT 1856.

   It therefore occurred to Mr. Whitehouse that the amount of magnetic force deve-

loped by the current in its passage through fine wire surrounding an electro-magnet,

--seemed 'to offer the most ready, and at the same time the most practical mode of

attaining tlie object ; an idea which received confirmation from the fact, that when-
ever such currents were used in telegraphy, they were always received upon and made

to actuate electro-magnets.

He therefore wound an electro-magnet with fine wire, placing its poles very near

to a keeper of soft iron, poised in the manner of a lever steelyard and loaded to any
given weight ; the current either lifted or did not lift the given weight, and this was

the test of what Mr. W. proposed to call its " value " in telegraphy.

   So delicate was this test that he had been able to determine accurately the " value,"

as it may be termed, of a current too feeble in its energy, and too brief in its dura-

tion, to give the slightest indication of its presence on one of the most sensitive

"detectors" usually employed in critical telegraphic operations.

He had actually weighed with accuracy a current whose force was represented by
'-ths of a grain ; and on the other hand currents with a wide range of quantity and

intensity, and of varying amounts of force up to no less than 600,000 grains.

Mr. Whitehouse then described in detail the principle and construction of the

instrument. The reels of fine wire were so arranged as to be easily removeable, in

order to substitute others carrying wire of different gauges, or even without this

change any two reels might be either joined up in series for intensity or in parallel

currents, which thereby halved the length while it doubled the area of conducting wire.

Mr. Whitehouse then illustrated its uses and practical capabilities.

1st. It had contributed valuable aid in the analysis of several forms of induction

coils, varying in size and construction ; it not only estimated in grains the value of

each' secondary current thus produced, but approximatively determined their relative
amounts of quantity and intensity, by noting the arrangement of wire which gave

the best result.                                                  ....
                                   .,
2ndly. It speedily indicated the advantage of using mduction coils in pairs rather

than singly, under which head some surprising results were given, the near presence

of an unexcitcd iron bar augmenting the value of the current in the coil under

observation.                 . ,,  ,                              ..           . i-

3rdly. It would evidently afford the means of practically determining a point of

considerable interest in the comparison of voltaic and magneto-electric currents,

to the solution of which Mr. Whitehouse had pledged himself: this was to ascer-

tain the economico-practical limits of battery series ; because the penetrating

power or intensity and value of currents so produced might hereby be accurately
compared with the force of coil currents educed from batteries of much simpler and

less wasteful construction, consisting only of one or two elements, instead of

hundreds.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                .
   4thly. It had, conjointly with the use of a pendulum and automatic recording

arrangements, led to the production of a series of curve diagrams, representing a
minute analysis of any given current, denoting its force, however variable, in the

several fractions of a second of time.
    5thly. It had enabled Mr. Whitehouse, with the assistance and cooperation of

Mr. Bright of the Magnetic Company, after weighing the value, upon short circuit,
of the currents from many of their magneto-instruments, so as to determine their
average value, to weigh the same currents after working through various distances,
from 40 to 320 miles of subterranean and submarine wires ; thus showing with
certainty and minute accuracy the loss due to the combined influence of resistance,

induction and defective insulation.
    Lastly. It had done good service in working out the laws relating to induction in

submarine circuits ; and some striking illustrations were given in conclusion.
   Working upon a 498 mile length of very perfectly insulated cable-wire, the phe-

nomena of induction and retardation, of charge and discharge, as originally described
by Faraday, were exhibited in a remarkable manner.

  A current, lifting 18,000 grains on short circuit, was sent into the long wire, the

further end of which was insulated ; but on cutting off the battery, and instantly
discharging the wire to earth through the same instrument, it gave a lifting power
of 60,000 grains j so strikingly cumulative was the tendency of this gigantic Leyden

jar. While, if both ends of the wire were discharged to earth simultaneously, a lift
of 96,000 grains was obtained, thus realizing as a return, more than five times the

Aamount which the battery gave on short circuit. Again : feeble magneto-current

of only 4 grains was adequate to work a telegraphic receiving instrument, a sensitive
galvanometer being placed in the same circuit ; but this latter gave most uncertain
indications of value ; its unsteady movements ranged wider with slow and feeble
currents, and indicated a lesser value for stronger currents, which followed more
rapidly in succession, all which however were accurately pourtrayed by the new

Ainstrument. Again : pair of induction coils, excited by six small Smee cells, gave

27,000 grains ; the mere addition of a soft iron armature at one end augmented
this to 43,000, while a similar one at the other end increased the current's value
up to 47,500.

   Mr. Whitehouse called it a " Magneto-electrometer " from its special adaptation
to the measurement of magneto-electric currents, while the terms galvanometer,
voltameter, and electrometer sufficiently indicated for these instruments their con-
nexion with other forms of electricity.

   The desirability of a definite and common standard of comparison was insisted on,
and Mr. Whitehouse promised to set aside for this special use the most accurately

finished and perfect instrument he could obtain, for the free use of any fellow-
labourers in the same field.

--The Law of the Squares is it applicable or not to the Transmission of Signals

               in Suhmarine Circuits? By W^ildman Whitehouse.

    Referring to the proceedings of this Section last year at Glasgow, the author
quoted Prof. W.Thomson's paper on this subject, where he stated " that a part of the
theory communicated by himself to the Royal Society last May, and published in
the ' Proceedings,' shows that a wire of six times the length of the Varna and Bala-
klava wire, if of the same lateral dimensions, would give thirty-six times the retar-
dation, and thirty-six times the slowness of action. If the distinctness of utterance
and rapidity of action practicable with the Varna and Balaklava wire are only such
as not to be inconvenient, it would be necessary to have a wire of six times the
diameter ; or better, thirty-six wires of the same dimensions ; or a larger number of
small wires twisted together, under a gutta-percha covering, to give tolerably
convenient action by a submarine cable of six times the length." The author then
stated, that circumstances had enabled him to make very recently a long series of
experiments upon this point, the results of which he proposed to lay before the
Section ; adding, that an opportunity still existed for repeating these experiments
upon a portion of cable to which he could obtain access, and that he was ready to
show them before a committee of this Section in London, if the important nature of
the subject should seem to render such a course desirable. Although the subject of

submarine telegraphy had many points of the highest importance requiring investi-
gation, and to the consideration of which he had been devoting himself recently,
Mr. Whitehouse proposed to confine his remarks on this occasion to the one point

indicated in the title, inasmuch as the decision of that one, either favourably or
otherwise, would have, on the one hand, the effect of putting a very narrow limit
to our progress in telegraphy, or, on the other, of leaving it the most ample scope.

He drew a distinction between the mere transmisssion of a current across the

Atlantic (the possibility of which he supposed everybody must admit) and the
effectual working of a telegraph at a speed sufficient for " commercial success ;
and we gathered from his remarks that there were those ready to embark in the
undertaking as soon as the possibility of " commercial success" was demonstrated.

    The author then gave a description of the apparatus employed in his researches,
 of the manner in which the experiments were conducted, and, lastly, of the results
 obtained. The wires upon which the experiments were made were copper, of No.

--16 gauge, very perfectly insulated with gutta percha spun into two cables, con-

 taining three wires of equal length (83 miles), covered with iron wires and coiled in
 a large tank in full contact with moist earth, but not submerged. The two cables
 were subsequently joined together, making a length of 166 miles of cable, containing
 three wires. In addition to this, in some of the latest experiments he had also the

advantage of another length of cable, giving with the above, an aggregate of 1020 miles.
The instruments, one of which was exhibited, seemed to be of great delicacy, capable of
the utmost nicety of adjustment and particularly free from sources of error. The
records were all made automatically, by electro-chemical decomposition, on chemi-
 cally prepared paper. The observations of different distances recorded themselves
 upon the same shp of paper; thus, 0, 83, and 249 miles were imprinted upon one paper,
 0,83, 498 miles upon another slip, 0, 249, 498 upon another, and 0, 535, 1020 upon
 another. Thus by the juxtaposition of the several simultaneous records on each
 slip, as well as by the comparison of one slip with another, the author has been
 enabled to show most convincingly that the law of the squares is not the law which
 governs the transmission of signals in submarine circuits. Mr. Whitehouse showed
 next, by reference to published experiments of Faraday's and Wheatstone's (Philo-
  sophical Magazine, July, 1855), that the effect of the iron covering with which the
 cable was surrounded was, electrically speaking, identical with that which would
 have resulted from submerging the wire, and that the results of the experiments
 could not on that point be deemed otherwise than reliable. The author next
  addressed himself to the objections raised against conclusions drawn from experi-
 ments in "Multiple" cables. Faraday had experimented, he said, upon wires
 laid in close juxtaposition, and with reliable results ; but an appeal was made to

  direct experiment, and the amount of induction from wire to wire was weighed, and
  proved to be as one to ten thousand, and it was found impossible tovaiy the amount
  of retardation by any variation in the arrangement of the wires. Testimony also
  on this point was not wanting. The Director of the Black Sea Telegraph, Lieut.-
  Col. Biddulph, was in England, and present at many of the experiments. He con-
  firmed our author's view, adding, " that there was quite as much induction and
  embarrassment of instruments in this cable as he had met with in the Black Sea
  line." The author considers it therefore proved, " that experiments upon such a
  cable, fairly and cautiously conducted, may be regarded as real practical tests, and
  the results obtained as a fair sample of what will ultimately be found to hold good
  practically in lines laid out in extenso. At the head of each column in the annexed
  Table is stated the number of observations upon which the result given was com-

 --puted, every observation being rejected on which there could fall a suspicion of

  carelessness, inaccuracy, or uncertainty as to the precise conditions ; and, on the
  other hand, every one which was retained being carefully measured to the hundredth
  part of a second. This Table is subject to correction, for variation in the state of

   the battery employed, just as the barometrical observations are subject to correction

  for temperature. Of this variation as a source of error I am quite aware, but I am
  not yet in possession of facts enough to supply me with the exact amount of cor-

   rection required. I prefer, therefore, to let the results stand without correction.

author then examined the evidence of the law of the squares, as shown hy the value
 of a current taken in submarine or subterranean wires at different distances from the
generator thereof, which he showed were strongly corroborative of the previous
results. He next examined the question of the size of the conducting wire ; and he
had the opportunity of testing the application of the law, as enunciated by Prof.
Thomson last year. The results, far from confirming the law, are strikingly opposed
to it. The fact of trebling the size of the conductor augmented the amount af
retardation to nearly double that observed in the single wire. The author, however,
looked for the experimentum crucis in the limit to the rapidity and distinctness of
utterance attainable in the relative distances of 500 and 1020 miles. 350 and 270
were the actual number of distinct signals recorded in equal times through th^e two
lengths respectively. These figures have no relation to the squares of the distance.
" Now, if the law of the squares be held to be good in its application to submarine
circuits, and if the deductions as to the necessary size of the wire, based upon that
law, can be proved to be valid also, we are driven to the inevitable conclusion that
submarine cables of certain length to be successful must be constructed in accord-
ance with these principles. And what does this involve ? In the case of the
Transatlantic line, whose estimated length will be no less than 2500 miles, it would

necessitate the use, for a single conductor only, of a cable so large and ponderous,

--as that probably no ship except Mr. Scott Russell's leviathian could carry it, so
--unwieldy in the manufacture, that its perfect insulation would be a matter almost of

practical impossibility, and so expensive, from the amount of materials employed,
and the very laborious and critical nature of the processes required in making and
laying it out, that the thing would be abandoned as being practically and commer-

cially impossible. If, on the- other hand, the law of the squares be proved to be
inapplicable to the transmission of signals by submarine wires, whether with refe-

rence to the amount of retardation observable in them, the rapidity of utterance to
be obtained, or the size of conductor required for the purpose, then we may shortly
expect to see a cable not much exceeding one ton per mile, containing three, four or
five conductors, stretched from shore to shore, and uniting us to our Transatlantic

brethren, at an expense of less than one-fourth that of the large one above men-
tioned, able to carry four or five times the number of messages, and therefore yielding
about twenty times as much return in proportion to the outlay. And what, I may
be asked, is the general conclusion to be drawn as the result of this investigation of
the law of the squares applied to submarine circuits ? In all honesty, I am bound
to answer, that I believe nature knows no such application of that law ; and I can
only regard it as a fiction of the schools, a forced and violent adaptation of a prin-
ciple in Physics, good and true under other circumstances, but misapplied here.

                                  On the Tides of Nova Scotia.
                By the Rev. Professor Chevallier, B.D., F.R.A.8.

   The observations to which reference is made were taken by a tide-gauge fixed
upon a wharf at the north end of the naval yard at Halifax. The tides there are
small in amount, the spring tides rising from 65 to 9 feet at Hahfax, and 8 feet at
Sambro Isle, twelve miles south of that place. The tides themselves appear to be quite

regular ; but in addition to the ordinary tide-wave there occurs a series of undula-
tions succeeding each other at intervals of twenty minutes or half an hour, the
difference of elevation and depression rarely exceeding 6 inches, and being usually

much less. They are more perceptible near low water ; but occur at all times of
tide, and are very distinctly marked upon the curve traced by the self-acting tide-
gauge. The question to be considered is, what is the cause of these small waves ?
1. They do not arise from any influence which the casual swell of the sea might
exercise upon the tide-guage : for the rise and fall of one of these waves very
seldom takes less time than a quarter of an hour, and often requires half an hour.
--24 REPORT 1856.

or even three-quarters of an hour. 2. They do not arise from undulatory motion in
the whole waters of the harbour. In order to examine this question, Mr. Edgcumbe
Chevallier, the storekesjDer in Halifax Dockyard, went to Sambro, ten or twelve miles
south of Halifax, and entirely clear of the harbour, and erected upon Power Island
a temporary gauge, with which he took the height of the water every five minutes
for the whole day. Having laid off the results in a form similar to that employed
with the fixed tide-gauge at Halifax, it was found that every irregularity at Halifax
was preceded ten or fifteen minutes by a larger irregularity at Sambro. These
observations show that the irregular waves do not arise from the peculiar form of
the harbour at Halifax. 3. At about sixty miles eastward from Halifax, outside
Sable Jsland, the Gulf-stream runs in nearly a north-eastern direction with consider-
able velocity; and between Sable Island and the land a counter-current runs nearly
in a south-western direction. One of these currents would elevate the surface of the
sea near the middle of the currents; and such an elevation of the surface over which
the tide-wave is propagated might give rise to undulations similar to those observed.

I am informed, however, that the undulations in question are observed on the
western side of Nova Scotia, to which any effect of those two currents could not extend.

4. Although the tides at Halifax and on the neighbouring coast are small, that
part of the ocean is near the indraught of the Bay of Fundy, where the peculiar
form of the coast and its position with reference to the great tide-wave of the
Atlantic give rise to a local tide of excessive magnitude. Such a tide, espe-
cially when reverberated from coast to coast in a comparatively narrow inlet,
might not improbably give rise to perceptible undulations in a neighbouring part
of the sea. If this be the cause, it might be expected that a similar effect should be
noticed where a tide of the like nature takes place. The Bay of Avranches is
a locality of this kind, and the island of Jersey appeared to be a place where any
undulations of the tide might probably be noticed. The extreme difference between
high and low water at St. Helier's is 42 feet, and the difference of height of the

mean high and low water is 36 feet. On inquiry, I find that about ten years since
a tide-guage was fixed at St. Helier's, but observed only at high water, when

irregularities were observed of the same kind as those noticed at Halifax. This seems
to give probability to the opinion that the irregularities observed in the tide at

Halifax may be connected with the unusual tides in the Bay of Fundy. But

whether they arise from this source, or are to be traced to some great reciprocating
motion to which the waters of the Atlantic may be subject, the phaenomenon deserves
to be studied, as likely to lead to a more extended knowledge of the hydrodynaraical
conditions of our globe.

Working Model of a Machine for polishing Specula for Reflecting Telescopes
                      and Lenses. By Richard Greene, M.D.

The polishing machine, the model of which I have now the honour of laying before

the British Association, scarcely deserves the name of an invention, inasmuch as

the public have for some years been in possession of a very beautiful machine,

invented by William Lassell, Esq. of Liverpool, and most ably constructed by my

very talented friend James Nasmyth, Esq. of Patricroft foundry. It will no doubt

occur to most persons acquainted with the very superior specula produced by both

these gentlemen with that machine, why trouble the Association with an imitation

of that invention ?

БThis question is solved by the weighty argument of the three letters  s. d.

The polishing machine of Mr. Lassell is constructed entirely of metal, is quite out

of the power of any amateur to construct, requires to be bolted to wall, can scarcely

be turned by hand power, weighs at least three or four hundredweight, and from

the great care and accuracy required in its construction, costs, I think, Б70, while

a light portable machine on the principle of this model can, without any difiicultv,
be made by any handy amateur with a common foot lathe for less than 70s., and

need not weigli 90 pounds. The only machine I ever made on this principle is

amply powerful to polish specula of 12 or 14 inches aperture ; its fly-wheel is only

2 feet diameter, weighing about 45 lbs., and such a fly-wheel can always be found

at the old iron stands for six or eight shillings : all the spindles are common bar iron
           TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                          25

with the journeys turned on them, and all the bearings are of box-wood, which is

far better than bell-metal, as neither heating, wearing, or scarcely ever requiring oil.

In that beautiful machine of Mr. Lassell, the axis of the table which carries the

speculum is in the same line with the axis of the slow crank, which by two systems

of gearing rotating round a fixed toothed wheel, the pin of the quick crank carries

the centre of the polisher with an epicycloidal motion over the surface of the specu-

lum. This machine effects the same object simply by a crank rotating in a circle,

but the centre of the table which carries the speculum, can be moved at pleasure

more or less distant from the centre of that circle. This simple sliding of the axis

of the table out of the line of the axis of the crank, causes the centre of the polisher

to describe over the face of the speculum the exact figure the more complex machine

produces.

  When first I contemplated the construction of a polishing machine on this very

simple principle, I never intended to do anything more than to imitate exactly the

motions which produced such happy results in the hands of its talented inventor.

In carrying out my design, it became obvious, that, by adding three or four more

pulleys, at a cost of less than half so many shillings, the machine (in addition to the

proved movements of Mr. Lassell's machine) was invested with a power enabling

an experimenter in that most interesting branch of practical science, to try the effect

of a vast variety of motions for figuring, which the more complex machine is not

Acapable of producing.  few of these motions have been transferred to paper, by

substituting for the iron sliding box (which by its pin moves the polisher) a wooden

sliding box carrj'ing a pencil, and in place of the speculum these pieces of paper

were laid on the table and held there with weights on their corners. The figures

are extremely regular and of every conceivable variety of curve.

   Several specula of 4^, 7, and 8^ inches have been repeatedly polished and repo-
lished with this machine, and in no instance has a really bad figure been the result.

Of course some wpre better than others ; but I believe it will be admitted by all who

have trodden this very difficult but interesting path of practical science, that a very

fine figure is as much entitled to be enrolled in the chapter of accidents, as a really

fine chronometer, which no care in its construction can possibly ensure. If the cause

of the imperfection of a speculum be ascertained, and it is found to be decidedly sphe-

rical or hyperbolical, the former can with certainty be removed by increasing the

excentricity of the table, and the latter by diminishing it. Very frequently, however,

it happens that the diflferent zones of a speculum, as tested by diaphragms, have their

foci coincident, j'et the speculum does not perform well, from a want of uniformity

in the curvature. In these cases I have derived great advantage from placing the

centre of the speculum a little excentric as regards the centre of the table, so that in

working the excentricity (which is the slow crank in Lassell's) is continually vary-

ing from the sum of the two excentricities, to their difference, the mean excentricity

remaining unchanged. Latterly, indeed, I have always employed the double excen-

Atricity.  few remarks upon the formation of the polisher will bring this descrip-

tion to a close. Mr. Lassell recommends making the polisher of two pieces of light

wood glued together, with their grain at right angles ; in his hands it has certainly
performed wonders, but as it is liable to warp with hygrometric changes in the

atmosphere, it is as well totally to prevent such warping by employing three, instead

of two pieces of board, making the two outside pieces at right angles to the centre

piece as regards their grain. To make the furrows in the pitch so that they shall

not fill up in poUshing, is extremely difficult by the ordinary process of pressing the

pitch while in a soft state with the edge of a ruler, as the pitch forced out of the

furrows is heaped up on the edges of the squares, leaving a hollow in the centre of

each square ; in working it is forced back again, and it is absolutely necessary that

the furrows should remain open during the entire process of polishing. I prefer

covering the surface of the polisher with squares of wood about -j- inch in thickness

and ^ an inch apart, stuck on with hot pitch or glue, and a nail in the centre. The
polisher being held with the face down, the squares are covered over with a brush

dipped in the pitch (not very hot), and repeating the operation until a proper thick-
ness be obtained ; when made in this way the furrows will never fill up except the

pilch be much too soft.

       On the Physical Structure of the Earth. By Professor Hennesst.

   After some preliminary observations as to the impossibility of accounting for the
earth's figure, without supposing it to have been once a fused mass, the exterior of
which has cooled into a solid crust, the process of solidification of the fluid was
described. The influence of the convection and circulation of the particles in a
heterogeneous fluid was shown to be different from what would take place in a
homogeneous fluid such as usually comes under our notice. As the primitive fluid
mass of the earth would consist of strata increasing in density from the surface
towards the centre, its refrigeration would be that of a heterogeneous fluid, and the
process of circulation would be less energetic in going from its surface towards its
centre. Thus the earth would ultimately consist of a fluid nucleus enclosed in a
spheroidal shell. The increase in thickness of this shell would take place by the
solidification of each of the surface strata of the nucleus in succession. If the matter
composing the interior of the earth is subjected to the same physical laws as the
material of the solid crust coming under our notice, the change of state in the fluid
must be accompanied by a diminution of its volume. The contrary hypothesis had
been hitherto always assumed in mathematical investigations relative to the form
and structure of the earth. The erroneous supposition that the particles of the
primitive fluid retained the same positions after the mass had advanced in the pro-
cess of solidification as they had before the process commenced, had been tacitly or
openly assumed in all such inquiries until it was formally rejected by the author*,
who proposed to assume for the fluid similar properties to those exhibited by the
fusion and solidification of such portions of the solidified crust as are accessible to
observation. The results to which the improved hypothesis has led, show that it
fundamentally affects the whole question, not only of the shape and internal struc-
ture of the earth, but also of the various actions and reactions taking place between
the fluid nucleus and the solid shell. If the process of solidification took place
without change of volume in the congelation of the fluid, the strata of the shell
would possess the same forms as those of the primitive fluid, and their oblateness
would diminish in going from the outer to the inner surface. If the fluid contracts
in volume on passing to the solid state, the remaining fluid will tend to assume a
more and more oblate figure after the formation of each stratum of the shell. The
law of density of the nucleus will not be the same as that of the primitive fluid, but
will vary more slowly, and the mass will thus tend towards a state of homogeneity
as the radius of the nucleus diminishes by the gradual thickening of the shell. The
surface of the nucleus, and consequently the inner surface of the shell, will thus
tend to become more oblate after each successive stratum added to the shell by con-
gelation from the nucleus. This result, combined with another obtained by Mr.
Hopkins, proves that so great pressure and friction exist at the surface of contact of
the shell and nucleus as to cause both to rotate together nearly as one solid mass.
 Other grounds for believing in the existence of the great pressure exercised by the
nucleus at the surface of the shell were adduced. If the density of the fluid strata
 were due to the pressures they support, and if the earth solidified without any change
 of state in the solidifying fluid, the pressure against the inner surface of the shell
 would be that due to the density of the surface stratum of the nucleus, and would
 therefore rapidly increase with the thickness of the shell. Contraction in volume

of the fluid on entering the solid state would diminish this pressure, but yet it may

 continue to be very considerable, as the coefficient of contraction would always
 approach towards unity. The phsenomena of the solidification of lava and of volcanic
 bombs were referred to in illustration of these viev^'s, and their application was then
 shown to some of the greatest questions of geology- The relations of symmetry
 which the researches of M. Elie de Beaumont seem to establish between the great
 lines of elevation which traverse the surface of the earth, appear to Prof. Hennessy
 far more simply and satisfactorily explained by the expansive tendency of the nucleus
 which produces the great pressure against the shell than by the collapse and subsi-
 dences of the latter. The direction- of the forces which would tend to produce a
 rupture from the purely elevatory action of the pressure referred to would be far
 more favourable to symmetry than if the shell were undergoing a distortion of shape

from collapsing inwards. The nearly spherical shape of the shell would also greatly

increase its resistance to forces acting perpendicularly to its surface, so as to cause
parts to subside, while the action of elevatory forces would pot be resisted in the same
manner.

      On the Eclipse of the iSun mentioned in the First Book of Herodotus,
                          By the Rev. Dr. Edward Hincks.

   The author maintained that the eclipse of the 18th of May, 603 B.C., was tha*
which terminated the Lydian war, and that from this celebrated eclipse and his
knowledge of the period of 223 lunations, Thales had predicted the eclipse of the
28th of May, 585 b.c. Herodotus, he thought, had confounded the two eclipses
with which the name of Thales was connected.

   Previously to the publication of Mr, Baily's paper in 1811, it was generally believed
by astronomers that the eclipse of 603 b.c. satisfied the conditions of that which
terminated the war, the field of battle being supposed to be in the neighbourhood of

Kars. Now that Mr. Baily's arguments against this eclipse have been shown to be

erroneous, the author regretted that recent writers had neglected it ; the elements of
it having never been calculated with the improved lunar tables now in use.

             On an Instrument to illustrate Poinsot's Theory of Rotation,
                                     By J. C. Maxwell.

   In studying the rotation of a solid body according to Poinsot's method, we have

to consider the successive positions of the instantaneous axis of rotation with refer-
ence both to directions fixed in space and axes assumed in the moving body. The
paths traced out by the pole of this axis on the invariable plane and on the central

ellipsoid form interesting subjects of mathematical investigation. But when we
attempt to follow with our eye the motion of a rotating body, we find it difficult to
determine through what point of the body the instantaneous axis passes at any
time,^and to determine its path must be still more diflScult. I have endeavoured to

render visible the path of the instantaneous axis, and to vary the circumstances of
motion, by means of a top of the same kind as that used by Mr. Elliot, to illustrate
precession*. The body of the instrument is a hollow cone of wood, rising from a

ring, 7 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick. An iron axis, 8 inches long, screws

into the vertex of the cone. The lower extremity has a point of hard steel, which
rests in an agate cup, and forms the support of the instrument. An iron nut,
three ounces in weight, is made to screw on the axis, and to be fixed at any point
and in the wooden ring are screwed four bolts, of three ounces, working horizontally,

and four bolts, of one ounce, working vertically. On the upper part of the axis is

placed a disc of card, on which are drawn four concentric rings. Each ring is
divided into four quadrants, which are coloured red, yellow, green, and blue. The

spaces between the rings are white. When the top is in motion, it is easy to see in
which quadrant the instantaneous axis is at any moment and the distance between
it and the axis of the 'instrument ; and we observe,^lst. That the instantaneous

axis travels in a closed curve, and returns to its original position in the body.
2ndly. That by working the vertical bolts, we can make the axis of the instrument
the centre of this closed curve. It will then be one of the principal axes of inertia.

Srdly. That, bj- working the nut on the axis, we can make the order of colours either
red, yellow, green, blue, or the reverse. When the order of colours is in the same

direction as the rotation, it indicates that the axis of the instrument is that of great-

est moment of ineirtia. 4thly. That if we screw the two pairs of opposite horizontal
bolts to different distances from the axis, the path of the instantaneous pole will no
longer be equidistant from the axis, but will describe an ellipse, whose longer axis is
in the direction of the mean axis of the instrument. 5thly. That if we now make one
of the two horizontal axes less and the other greater than the vertical axis, the instan-

taneous pole will separate from the axis of the instrument, and the axis will incline
more and more till the spinning can no longer go on, on account of the obliquity.

It is easy to see that, by attending to the laws of motion, we may produce any
of the above effects at pleasure, and illustrate many different propositions by means
of the same instrument.

On the Constancy of Solar Radiation. By Professor Pxazzi Smyth, F.R.S.Et

Having lately recomputed all our earth-therraometric observations from the

year 1838 to 1854 inclusive, I am able to offer to the Association a few particulars

respecting a cosmical question, on which many speculations have been ventured, but

--no exact numerical particulars ascertained, I mean the constancy in amount of heat

radiated from the sun.

These earth-thermometers have been observed once a week during the whole

period alluded to, and are admirably adapted to equalize temporary meteorological

variations, and to give good mean results.

Their bulbs (filled with alcohol) are buried in the porphyry rock of the hill at the

several depths of 3, 6, 12, 24 French feet, and their tubes are long enough to rise to

the surface of the ground where the scales are placed, and may be read off to "01 of

a degree Fahrenheit. This set of thermometers was one of those which were esta-

blished in and about Edinburgh in 1837 for the British Association, under the care

of Prof. J. D. Forbes, and it is the only one of them which has survived more than

half the period which has elapsed. The excellence and completeness of the burial

of the bulb of every thermometer is vouched for by the length of time which the

wave of summer heat is found to occupy in reaching each bulb in succession accord-

ing to its depth. Thus the 3-feet thermometer has its maximum in August ; the

6-feet ditto in September; the 12-feet ditto in October; and the 24- feet ditto in Decem-

ber or January. Again, from the annual range decreasing with the depth, as the
= =3-feet thermometer, annual range
=12-feet ditto, annual range                         15░                 the G-feet ditto, annual range  9░'8                   the
                                                                      ;                                                      ;

                              4░"6                   and the 24-feet ditto, annual range := 1░'2.                               And
                                                  ;

when it is added that each weekly observation is carefully corrected for the effect

caused by the difference between the temperature of the bulb, and of the several

parts of the stem and scale, it will be seen, I trust, that the annual means of such

observations must be worth some attention. They are as follow :

ness of the bad conducting rock between the lowest of our thermometers and any
part of the earth where its substance can be fluid with heat, and be capable of
assuming more sudden changes of position or temperature than a solid can, we may
safely in a first examination consider the internal or terrestrial effect as constant at
each depth for the whole period from 1838 to 1854. The effect is small, but veiy
sensible, as thus :

certainly very similar to what an alteration in the zero-points might do, we have

such evidence in special features of difference between the curves of the several
thermometers. Thus while ^^ and t^, by the rapid and uniform rise of their cui"ves
at the beginning of the period, lead one to suspect the possibility of something in-

strumental affecting them, yet it may be that the observations were commenced at
the bottom of one of the temperature waves, of which there are evidently three, with

a nearly sexennial period between 1838 and 1854. If this latter be the true expla-

nation, then inasmuch as U is retarded in its indications on t^ and ^3 by two or three

months, it ought to show in 1838 by so much the temperature of the opposite slope

of the wave, and its curve should not reach its maximum depression so pointedly in

On1838 as those of ^4 and ^3 .  looking at it, we find t^ fulfilling these expectations

perfectly, for its curve, instead of rising up steeply from 1838 to 1839, is nearly

level.

But there is still another proof: ti ought to exhibit the retarded effects of t^ in a

still greater degree, if the continued rise of ti and ^3 in 1838-39 and 1840 be due to a

cosmical cause, and not to an instrumental defect that would act on all the thermo-

Nowmeters ahke.  t^ does precisely what it should do on such a hypothesis ; for

instead of being only level like t^ for 1838-39, it is even depressed, having its minimum

in the latter year.
    Similarly, it will be found through the whole of the period of our observations,

that by their regulated differences from each other depending on the effect of the

several depths of non-conducting matter covering each of them, the several thermo-
meters serve to confirm each other, as really indicating changes in the mean tempe-
rature of the surface of the earth, such as can hardly be attributed to any cause but
the variations in the development of solar light and heat.

   In this case the ascertainment of the period of the secular wave must be of the
utmost importance ; for its summit may bring us years warmer than any that have
been felt in our own day, and the bottom of it seasons with cold in corresponding

severity.

    On a Collimator for completing the Adjustments of Reflecting Telescopes.
                     By Professor G. Johnstone Stoney, M.A.

   This paper described an accessory to large reflecting telescopes, designed to assist
in adjusting their mirrors at night with more ease and accuracy than hitherto. In
general construction the new collimator resembles the telescopes made use of by
engineers ; it differs only so far that provision must be made for sufficiently illu-
minating the wires or an artificial star, and that its large lens should have a focal
length/, determined by the equation

                                    1-- 1_1
                                    f~d F'

where F is the focal length of the telescope to be adjusted, and d is the distance from

the centre of the large lens of the collimator to the cross wires. If this instrument
be placed in the usual position of the eye-pieces, the illuminated cross wires, and

the image of them which will be formed, may be viewed in it, and if these be now

brought into coincidence by the adjustment of the mirrors, the line from the inter-
section of the cross wires to the centre of the large lens of the collimator will be
the optic axis of the telescope ; i. e. this ray, after reflexion from the small mirror
will, if produced backward, pass through the centre of curvature of the large mirror.

A slight addition to the arrangement would ensure that this axis should also pass

approximately through the vertex of the large mirror ; but it was supposed that,
so far as the optical performance of the telescope is concerned, this would be found
a needless refinement if the collimator be employed only to complete adjustments
already approximately made by the usual methods, and if the small mirror be
properly supported.

   The experiments which had been made showed that this latter condition was one
of much importance and required that the support of the small mirror should be very
stiff, and that the small mirror should be counterpoised at the end of it. The small
mirror is usually supported by a single arm placed edgewise, in order to intercept
but little light; a second bar, also placed edgewise, aad forming a small angle
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                               SI

with the first, had been found sufficient to make the arrangement capable of re-

sisting flexure and vibration in a surprising degree, and, as the angle may be reduced

so far that both bars can be attached to a slide carrying the eye- pieces, it is also

more convenient than the steadying wire which has been sometimes employed.

The facility and accuracy offered by the use of the new collimator are such, that it

was suggested that in some instances it might be desirable to make arrangements for

adjusting the telescope after every considerable change of altitude. If the collimator

were to be thus frequently employed, a beautiful contrivance made use of by Lord

Rosse might with much advantage be adapted to it, by mounting it and one or two

of the eye-pieces in a slide so that any one of them could in a moment be brought

Aopposite to the cone of rays.  slide moving on a centre was recommended. Since

the tilt of the large mirror will thus become of less importance, we may henceforth

admit for its support arrangements which introduce more tilt than those at present

in use, and thus the solution of what now remains the most difficult problem of

large reflecting telescopes may possibly be facilitated.

                             On the Causes of Great Inundations.
          By Thomas Dobson, B.A., of St. John's College, Cambridge.

   The principal special causes which tend to produce great inundations in a country
are, the inclination and the lithological character of the surface of the basins drained
by the rivers of the country.

   Where the subsoil of a river-basin is composed chiefly of porous and therefore

permeable materials, as oohte, loose gravel, &c., the rain will be absorbed almost as
fast as it falls, and will reach the river gradually, after returning to the surface
through springs.

   But where the subsoil is generally compact and impermeable, as clay, granite, &c.,
the rain will flow over the surface with more or less velocity, according to the

greater or less inclination of the surface to the horizon.
   So far, therefore, as the geological character of a river-basin is concerned, the

tendency to inundation due to that basin will be measured by the difference between
the areas of the permeable and of the impermeable superficial strata, and by the
inclination of the sides of the basin to the horizon.

   The general cause of great inundations in the countries forming the western sea-
board of Europe, is the easterly progressive motion of the cyclones, or revolving
storms, of the North Atlantic Ocean.

    Starting from the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, and sweeping during a

considerable portion of their early course along the warm surface of the Gulf- stream,

they collect the vapours so copiously generated in southern latitudes and finally pre-
cipitate them on the high lands and mountain chains of Europe. In general, several
cyclones follow each other in rapid succession, so that the continued rains at length
saturate the earth, and floods and inundations ensue.

   I shall illustrate these remarks on the general cause of European inundations by a
brief meteorological history of the great inundations in France in October 1844,

--October 1846, and in May and June of the present year.
   1844. The tracks of the cyclones of October 1844 have been determined by
Mr. Redfield. The first passed over the West Indian Islands on the 1st and 2nd of
32 EEPOET--1856.

October. The second was the " great Cuba hurricane," which destroyed more than
a hundred ships at Havannah, Jamaica, &c. The loss at Havannah alone was
estimated at ,Б1,000,000. Its diameter already exceeded 1000 miles. Passing over
Cuba on the 3rd and 4th of October, it skirted the coasts of the United States, and
struck off eastward into the North Atlantic Ocean at Newfoundland on the 8th

of October. Smaller cyclones, waterspouts, &c., as usual, followed in its rear.

   The barometer in Britain, as shown by the annexed curve, distinctly recognizes
the arrival of each member of this chain of aerial eddies. Tempests, rains, unusually
heavv floods, and destructive inundations marked their progress over France, Ger-

--many, Italy, &c.
   1846. On the 10th of September, 1846 (Col. Reid, 'Development of the Law of

Storms,' p. 371), a great cyclone formed between the islands of Trinidad, Marguerita,

Grenada, and Tobago. " As it advanced, its force increased, until it became a tempest

of a furious kind. Passing to the westward of Bermuda, it blew there a hard gale

on the l7th and 18tb, with the centre a little to the eastward of Newfoundland,

where it did great damage to the town of St. John's, and was felt as far as 19░ W.,
We50░ N. on the eastern side of the Atlantic."
                                                have here evidence that this cyclone

came from the West India Islands to the mouth of the English Channel. The

barometric readings given by Col. Reid show that the south-eastern margin passed

over Bermuda between the 13th and 20th of September. The accompanying baro-

metric curves for Rouen and the Orkneys during September and October 1846, prove

that the front of this cyclone first aifected the barometer at Rouen on the ] 7th of

September.

   This was followed by a series of cyclonic paroxysms, of which the most violent

has been examined in detail by Mr. Redfield. It began in the Caribbean Sea on the
6th of October, and passed over Havannah on the 11th, wrecking more than 100

ships, and sending the mercurial column down to 27'70 inches. On the 12th nearly

the whole town of Rey West,in Mexico, was destroyed, and twenty ships driven ashore.

On the 13th it swept over Washington and New York, and started across the

Atlantic from Newfoundland on the 14th of October.

          1846,

   These dates indicate approximately the position of the central area, which may
have a diameter of 100 miles, while the whole cyclone probably extends more than
2000 miles, for the barometer shows that the front often strikes the British Islands
about the same time as the rear is leaving Newfoundland.

   Here then was an uninterrupted series of cyclones, which, beginning among the
tropical heats of the West Indies, crossed the Atlantic in succession and maintained
a continuous discharge of storms and unprecedently heavy rains in Britain, France,
Germany, and Italy, from the l/th of September to the end of October.

   On the 30th of September a destructive tempest passed over Sicily and Italy. Seven
villages near Messina were destroyed by storms and inundations. At Portici many
houses fell and fifteen persons perished. The village of St. Firmin was engul()hed and
many lives lost. From the 15th to the 18th of October a tempest raged over the
whole Continent. During that period there fell 'ISS m. (6 inches) of rain at Mont-
brison, in France. On the I6th, the village of Schledorf, three leagues from Munich,
was utterly destroyed by a storm of wind, rain, and lightning. On the 1 8th the

great rivers of France overflowed ; the Loire rose 6'94 metres (Ji yards) above its
mean height, and a general inundation ensued, the most destructive since that of the
13th of November, 1790.

    In the Tyrol> it rained incessantly from the 28th to the 31st of October, and the
River Elsch inundated the country.

   On the western coasts of Britain and Ireland, the rear of the last cyclone pro-

duced a hurricane from N.W., which occasioned great loss of life and property on
the 22nd and 23rd of October.

   1850.-- Before considering the inundations of 1856, it will be useful to show that
the elevated temperature which invariably accompanies the southern half of a cyclone,

                                                              January 1850.

                                                                                       232125 26

may sometimes exert a powerful influence in promoting an inundation by suddenly
melting the snows accumulated on the mountains during the winter. On the 26th
of January, 1850, a warm rain began to fall at Paris, and melted the snows at the

sources of the Seine and its affluents so rapidly as to produce an extraordinary flood.

The annexed barometrical curves for the Orkneys, Versailles, and Bordeaux, show

the presence at that time of a cyclone of moderate dimensions, the central track

passing between the Orkneys and Versailles. The outer southern margin passes

over Bordeaux, where the wind is light. At Versailles the thermometric curves show
that the warm S.W. wind raised the temperature 12░ C, and the cold N.W. wind
afterwards produced a corresponding depression. These curves are good types of
the general actions of the barometer and thermometer during the transit of a cyclone.

  --1856. In order to determine as accurately as possible the various phases of the

 weather in Great Britain during the months of April and May, 1856, I have con-
 structed the curve of barometric pressure, and the curves of maximum and minimum
 temperature (the latter on the scale of 20░ F. to an inch) from the observations
 during these months, at eight stations of the British Meteorological Society; viz.
 Elgin, Anstruther, and Makerstoun, in Scotland ; Stonyhurst, Wakefield, Canter-
 bury, and Teignmouth, in England ; and Lampeter, in Wales. From these I have
 selected to accompany this paper the curves for Wakefield, where observations are
 made night and day at equal intervals of six hours, and those for Elgin and Teign-
 mouth, the extreme stations to the North and South respectively.

     These curves indicate, as in the case of the inundations of 1846, a succession of
  cyclones, of storms of wind and rain, producing floods of increasing height and

 violence, until the culminating disastrous inundations at the end of May and in the

  beginning of June.

    Two cyclones, either of enormous extent or of slow progressive motion, occupy

 the whole month of April. The first ended about the 15th, and caused great floods
  in the Garonne, and other large rivers of France. The second cyclone had passed
 over by the 2nd of May. An abrupt depression of the mercury, accompanied by
  heavy easterly gales, shows the passage of a cyclone between the 3rd and 8th of

 May ; the central track lying to the south of Britain. From the 8th to the 20th of May,

  a deep cyclonic depression occurs. Physical phsenomena happen during this period,

 which frequently characterize the passage of cyclones in tropical countries. On the
 10th of May there was a heavy earthquake at Saint Rabier, in the canton of Terras-

son, by which a mountain was precipitated into a ravine. On the same day great

storms devastated Rhenish Bavaria ; a destructive waterspout fell in the commune of

Dembach, and the Garonne and other rivers of France again overflowed. On the 1 2th

of May a waterspout fell at Givry, St. Denis                                                                                                                                                                                                     and another at Beaume on the 15th.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

In Britain the temperature rose 20░ F. on the 9th, with the S.W. wind, and con-

tinued high until the end of the month. Several accounts from the south and west
of France mention the powerful influence of the south and south-west winds at this
time in melting the snows on the mountains.

   The barometric curve shows that the centre of the cyclone passed on the 18th, a
day signalized by great storms at London, Rouen, and in the South of France. At
Nantes on that day, the wind blew violently from the S.W. and then shifted sud-

denly to the northward, a well-known indication of the passage of the centre of a

cyclone.

From the 20th to the 30th of May, the faithful barometer registers the passage

over Britain of the northern margins of two closely-allied cyclones, whose centres

lay far to the southward. In each case the wind veers from S.E. through E. to

N.E., and the depressions increase in depth towards the south.

  A very heavy thunder-storm passed over England on the 22nd of May ; at Brad-

ford Moor a man was killed by lightning ; the Midland Railway was flooded and
several villages inundated. At Leeds the river Aire overflowed, and two lives were

lost.

  On the 25th of May two men were killed by lightning during a thunder-storm, at

Strabane, in Scotland.

   On the 29th of May, Brighton, Hastings, Portsmouth, and all the South Coast

of England, were visited by a violent storm of thunder, lightning, rain, and hail.
   Such were the effects in Britain, which was merely grazed by the northern margins

of the two associated cyclones. The effects were much more disastrous in countries

farther south, which lay nearer to the centres of the cyclones. Violent storms of
wind, hail, and rain traversed France, Austria, Italy, and Spain. The enormous

falls of rain deluged the countries already saturated by the previous inundations of the
middle of May. At Lyons it rained continuously for forty-six hours, from 7 p.m. of
the 29th to 5 p.m. of the 3lst of May. At Ainay, the rain measured in this interval

was '30 m. (Iff inches), and at Aux Brotteaux it was '22 m. (8i inches). These
rains were general over the western countries of Europe. An indication of the east-

erly progress of these cyclones is given by an account of a great storm which broke

over Ratisbon on the afternoon of the 31st of May, accompanied by a waterspout.

Great damage ensued at Ratisbon. Scarcely one house in Lichtenfels was uninjured,

whole roofs were carried away, and the strongest trees uprooted.

   The numerous cyclone-tracks determined by Redfield and Reid all tend to pass to
the northward of Great Britain, and this agrees with the well-known predominance

of south-westerly and westerh' gales here. But the barometric curves, and the

winds, prove that the centres of the twin-cyclones of May 20 to 30 lay far to the south

of England.

Now, as cyclones invariably move, more or less, from the equator towards the

pole, their track must have been through latitudes unusually low, at a season of the

year when the sun has a high northern declina-                                                                                                                                                                                                   May 1856, Bordeaux,

tion. This passage through an atmosphere of an

elevated temperature, and therefore abounding in

vapour, will account for the altogether abnormal

quantities of rain which they precipitated on southern

Europe.

   M. Abria, Dean of the Faculty of Sciences of Bor-
deaux, having most obligingly forwarded to me a copy

of his Meteorological Observations, taken four times

daily, from May 20th to June 6th, I am enabled to

determine approximately, as in the annexed sketch, the positions of the centres of
the twin-cyclones of the end of May.

   The first cyclone declared its approach at Bordeaux on the 21st by "a very strong"
S.E. gale, with thunder and lightning. The centre, therefore, lay to the south of
Bordeaux. Where the two cyclones impinge upon and interfere with each other,

                                                                                               3*
--36 REPORT 1856.

the S.W. wind of the second neutralizes the N.E. wind of the first ; the wind is
feeble and the mercury rises. Nevertheless, the S.W. prevails on the 25th ; this
changes to W., and finally to N.W. on the 28th and 29th with almost continual
rain. These winds show that the centre of the second cyclone passed to the north
of Bordeaux, and therefore between Bordeaux and Teignmouth.

    In neither of these cyclones is the central barometric depression so extreme as is

usual in the great winter storms. This may probably arise from the confusion or

juxtaposition of the central spaces.

On the Balahlava Tempest, and the Mode of Interpreting Barometrical Fluc-
       tuations. By T. DoBSON, B.A. of St. John's College, Cambridge.

In the month of November, 1854, the passage of a storm over the British islands

caused a considerable depression of the barometric column, beginning on the 11th

of November and ending on the 19th, as shown by the barometric curves which

accompany this paper. During four consecutive days of this period of diminished

atmospheric pressure, there occurred in the coal mines of Britain six fatal explo-

--sions, at the following places : on Nov. 13, at Old Park Colliery, Dudley, Worces-

tershire ; Nov. 14, Cramlington Colliery, Northumberland; Nov. 15, Bennett's

Colliery, Bolton, Lancashire ; Birchey Coppice Colliery, Dudley ; and Coalbrook
Vale Colliery, Monmouthshire ; Nov. 16, Rosehall Colliery, Coatbridge, N.B.

These facts alone render this storm worthy of especial attention, independently of

the notoriety which it has acquired from its disastrous effects on the allied fleets

and armies in the Crimea. The meteorological circumstances which characterized

the Balaklava tempest have been determined with unusual care and skill, from a very

great number of observations at stations spread over the whole surface of Europe,

by M. Liais, of the Imperial Observatory at Paris. In all probability, many years

will elapse before a great storm on land is subjected to an examination so rigorous

and complete as that undertaken by M. Liais, in the present instance. This storm

may therefore be adopted as the most satisfactory test that we are likely to have

for some time to come of the correctness of the principles of interpretation which

myI have already applied to barometric fluctuations in  report on the relation be-

--tween explosions in coal mines and revolving storms, principles which flow directly
from the nature of cyclones.

   For the observations with which I have constructed the barometrical curves for
November, 1854, at Teignmouth in Devonshire, Stonyhurst in Lancashire, Wakefield

in Yorkshire, and Dunino in Scotland, I am indebted to Mr. Glaisher, the able

Secretary of the British Meteorological Society. The curve for the Orkney Islands
is from observations published in the 'Philosophical Magazine.' At Wakefield and
Stonyhurst observations are made four times a day, at the other stations twice a day.

--The cyclonic interpretation in this case would be First, that the curves indicate the

passage of a cyclone, of which the central track lay to the southward of England.

This is inferred from the gradual increase of the barometric depression from the
Orkneys in the north to Teignmouth in the south, and depends on the fact that the
height of the mercurial column decreases continuously from the circumference to the
centre of a cyclone. ITais inference is confirmed by the observation that the wind
blewfrom the eastward at all the above-mentioned stations. Secondly, that the cyclone
was progressing to the eastward. This is derived from observing that at each

station the wind began at S.E. while the mercury was falling, veered to E. when
the mercury was lowest, and then to N.E. as the mercury rose. If the wind had

veered from S.W. through W. to N.W., as it does most frequently in British storms,

and the barometric depressions had increased from Teignmouth towards the Orkneys,
the interpretations would have been, that the depression was caused by a cyclone
travelling eastward, of which the central track lay to the north of Scotland. In the
first case (A), the explanation would be that the chord (S.E., E., N.E.) passed over
the British islands, and the chord (S.W., W., N.W.) in the second case (B). Such
deductions are both obvious and satisfactory to persons whose knowledge of nautical
technicalities has enabled them to appreciate the demonstrations of the rotatory

and progressive motions of Atlantic cyclones, given by Redfield, Reid, &c. M. Liais
having favoured me with an opportunity of studying his unpublished charts of the
Balaklava tempest, I have found therein a distinct and impressive confirmation of
the correctness of the method of interpreting barometric fluctuations according to the

laws of cyclonology. These charts fully establish the truth of the inferences derived
above from the contemporaneous barometric curves in Britian. They prove that the
Balaklava tempest was a cyclone, moving to the eastward, along a central track which
lay to the southward of Britain. It is known that during their transit from the
Gulf of Mexico to the western coasts of Europe, across the comparatively uniform
surface of the ocean, cyclones preserve an approximately circular form. The excellent

charts of M. Liais, at the same time that they exhibit the progress of the storm day
by day, from the shores of Britain across the continent of Europe, to the Caucasian
mountains and the borders of the Caspian Sea, show also the remarkable modifica-
tions produced in the normal condition of the cyclone by mountains and other

 irregularities of the surface of the land. Thus, for example, a portion of the cyclone
 is delayed nearly twenty-four hours in passing the Alps. The consequence of this
and similar obstructions is, that what was nearly a circular atmospheric wave while
 crossing the ocean, takes the form of a much elongated and somewhat distorted

ellipse on land, enveloping an elliptical central area of maximum barometric depres-
 sion, which extends, on one chart, from Dantzic in the Baltic to Varna in the Black
 Sea. Around this central space the wind still blows continuously in the direction

 peculiar to the cyclones of the northern hemisphere. In the case therefore of the

 Balaklava temjiest, whose nature has been determined with much greater exactness
 than that of any other tempest on land, we have unequivocal testimony that the
 principles of cyclonology may be safely applied to interpret the fluctuations of the

 barometer in Great Britain.

On a Model of a Self- Registering Anemometer. Desig?ied and Constructed by
        R. Beckley, of Kew Observatory. Described by Mr. Welsh.

In this model Mr. Beckley has adopted Dr. Robinson's method of measuring the

velocity of the wind by the rotation of a system of hemispherical cups, the direc-

tion being indicated by a double wheel-fan like the directing vane at the back of a

Awindmill.  stout tubular support carries the whole of the external part of the

instrument, including the measurer of velocity, the direction vane, and a rain-gauge.

This support is so made that it can be easily adapted to the roof of any building

upon which it may be necessary to mount it. All the rotatory parts of the anemo-

meter run upon friction balls. The shaft of the apparatus for measuring the move-

ment of the wind, by means of a diminishing train of wheels, is made to turn a

cylinder upon which is wrapped a sheet of paper of the kind used for "metallic

memorandum books," this paper having the property of receiving a trace from a

style of brass. The sheet of paper is divided into two sections, upon one of which

is recorded the motion of the wind and upon the other the direction. As the

cylinder is being turned by the action of the wind, a clock carries a pencil along the

cylinder at a uniform rate of 1 2 inches in the twenty-four hours. To the lower end of

the direction shaft is attached a spiral of such a figure that equal angles correspond to

equal increments of radius; the edge of this spiral consists of a thin slip of brass, which

touches the paper and records the direction of the wind on a rectilinear scale. When

the sheet of paper is unwrapped from the cylinder after twenty-four hours, the motion

of the wind and the direction are both found projected in rectangular co-ordinates.
   With reference to anemometric observations at sea, Mr. Welsh read the following

extract from a letter which he had addressed to the Chairman of the Kew Committee,

--describing a method of making allowance for the efl^ect of the ship's motion upon

the observed velocity and direction of the wind : ^"By means of a portable Robinson's
anemometer, provided with a means of observing the total number of turns made by

the rotating part in any given lime, observe the apparent velocity of the wind and
record it in knots per hour. By an anemoscope of any kind register the apparent direc-

tion of the wind. From the log-book take the rate and direction of the ship's motion.

On a slate or other similar surface scratch a permanent compass circle. Set off from

the centre of the circle, on the radius of the direction of the ship's head, by any

convenient scale, the number of knots per hour the ship is going ; from this point

draw a pencil line parallel to the direction of the wind as observed by the aneino-

scope (i. e. the apparent direction to which the wind is going) ; set off on this hne

the number of knots per hour as shown by the anemometer ; draw a line from the

centre of the circle to this last point. The length of this line by the scale adopted

gives the tnie velocity of the wind, and its direction (carried backwards) shows the

Apoint/row which the wind is coming.  parallel ruler divided on the edge is all

that is required besides the slate. It would be easy enough to contrive some

mechanism to save the trouble of drawing lin^s, but it would not, I believe, be any

real simplification, and would increase the expense. The train of indicating wheels

might be so arranged that they at once indicate knots per hour without reference

to tables, and can be readily set to zero for a fresh observation."

On a remarkable Hail-Storm in North Staffordshire. With some Casts of the
                                Hailstones. By R. Garner.

   This storm, which came from the N.W. in the afternoon of the 22nd of July last,

between four and five o'clock, continued with great violence for about half an hour,
some of the masses of ice which fell being li inch in diameter, and of course doing
corresponding injury, for instance, breaking more than twenty large squares of glass
in the rather small house of his (the writers's) next-door neighbour, and those of
his own Wardian case. Most of the hailstones seemed to have nodulated nuclei,
containing numerous particles of air, and externally to these were formed irregular
conglomerations of ice, looking like a mass of imperfect but transparent crystals.
The storm was attended with gusts of wind and thunder, and was of a very limited
and defined extent ; but to the south of the writer's residence, about four miles
away, near the Barlaston Station, a violent wind fr6m an opposite direction, S.W.
or S.S.W., occurred at the same hour, without rain or hail, the ravages of which
could afterwards be traced for a length of two miles, with a breadth of only from
50 to 100 yards. Oaks were deprived by it of their largest limbs, poplars broken at
the height of 8 or 12 feet from the ground, and an alder, 50 feet high, was uprooted
and carried some distance. The clouds were extremely dark for a great extent of

country. An artist took some casts of such hailstones as he picked up, by no means

the largest. These the writer exhibited with a drawing.

            On Isothermal Lines. By Professor Hennessy, M.R.I.A.

   After some preliminary remarks as to the general influence of the distribution of
land and water on the forms of isothermal lines, the author proceeded to discuss
the distribution of these lines in islands. By considering an island situated so as

to have its shores bathed by a warm oceanic current, if the influence of direct solar

radiation be obstructed, it appears that the isothermals would be closed curves
surrounding the centre of the island and having some relation to its coast line. The
influence of ranges of mountains, and in general of inequalities in the surface of the
island, as well as the modifying action of general winds, and the resulting changes

in the shapes of the isothermals, were explained. By the introduction of solar
radiation, it now follows from the mathematical theory of heat that the entire quan-

tity of heat received by a unit of surface of the island will depend on two principal
terms : one, a function of the distance of the point from the coast, and capable of
being expressed in some cases as a function of the difference of latitude of that point
and the nearest point on the coast ; and, secondly, of a term depending on the
latitude and on an elliptic function of the second order having for its modulus the
sine of the inclination of the equator to the ecliptic. It hence follows that the effect
of solar radiation will be to transport the centres of all the closed isothermals
towards the pole of the hemisphere in which the island is situated. Some of the

lines may thus ultimately terminate at the coast with their convex sides turned
towards the equator, while others may still continue as closed curves in the in-

terior. If the influence of difference of latitude and direct solar radiation were
greatly predominant compared to other causes affecting the temperature of the

island, the isothermals might all terminate on the coast. If the continents may
be considered as immense islands so circumstanced, they become subjects for the
--40 REPORT 1856.

--application of these views. Prof. Hennessy then proceeded to show that the

isothernials of Ireland strictly conformed to his theory. On discussing the obser-
vations collected and arranged by Dr. Lloyd in his ' Memoir on the Meteorology of

Ireland,' it appears some of its isothermals are actually closed curves, while others
terminate at points on the coast, the shortest being closest to the equator. The
physical structure of Ireland, and the difference of nearly 4░ between the tempera-
ture of the seas bathing its shores and the air above them, rendered it probable,
d priori, that Ireland should present a good example for the application of the
theory. From the general nature of his views. Prof. Hennessy anticipated that the
discussion of observations in other islands would lead to their further confirma-
tion ; and it would ultimately follow, that not only are isothermals sinuous in their
shapes and not generally parallel to the equator, but that many would be found
which do not at all circumscribe the axis which joins the opposite poles of the earth.

       On an Instrument for observing [Vertical Currents in the Atmosphere.
                                 By Professor Hennesst.

   The author said he had been led to devise this instrument when offering an
explanation, printed in the ' Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy,' of certain
abnormal phienomena sometimes observed on the surface of Lough Erne. The
instrument is constructed like a common wind-vane, but instead of the fixed tail, a
circular disc is placed vertically on an axis passing through the branches of a fork
at the tail end. This disc is pierced about half-way between its centre and circum-
ference so as to admit another axle, to the ends of which are firmly attached two
light rectangular discs. These discs are always in a horizontal position, whatever
may be the position of the circular disc, for each of them has ap endulum attached to its
centre by which the centre of gravity is kept considerably below the axle. These
discs, theiefore, cannot be acted on by a wind which blows horizontally. The position
of the circular disc will thus very clearly show whether any given current has an
upward or a downward tendency. The application of this instrument to the study
of mountain winds was pointed out, as well as to assist in studying some of the undula-
tory movements of the atmosphere. In the trials which have been already made
with it. Prof. Hennessy stated that it gave satisfactory results. The instrument is
of course not an anemometer, but simply a kind of universal anemoscope, for it shows
both the horizontal and vertical directions of a current.

On Negretti and Zambra's Mercurial Minimum Thermometer.
                   By John Lee, LL.D., F.R.S.

Dr. Lee exhibited the thermometer to the Section, and pointed out the advantages of

a thermometer of mercury in preference to alcohol, which is subject to unequal ex-

pansion at different degrees of heat ; it is a desideratum that ail thermometers in

a meteorological observatory should be constructed with one fluid, and that mercury,

the recognized standard measurer of heat. The thermometer has been tried at the

Observatory of Greenwich; by Mr. Glaisher, the Secretary of the British Meteoro-

logical Society                                                                    Mr. E. J. Lowe of the Beeston Observatory, and several other emi-
                                                                                ;

nent meteorologists ; some instances have occurred in which errors in the alcohol

minimum thermometer have been corrected by the observations made by the mer-

curial minimum thermometer.

   Dr. Lee made some remarks upon a pamphlet recently printed by Dr. Herbert

Barker, of Bedford, on the relative value of the Ozonometers of Dr. Schcinbein and
Dr. Moffat, based upon daily observations made for eighteen months at Bedford, and

--he drew the attention of the audience to the following points : 1. Whether ozone

observations have generally been conducted by them in their meteorological ob-
servations? 2. Whether they use Schonbein's or Moffat's test papers, or both?
3. Whether they have noticed the difference between those which the Bedford
observations those of Mr. Glaisher in various parts of London, and those at Hart-
well House Observatory indicate ? 4. Whether they will without delay add the
Ozonometer to their instruments, as so much interest and importance belongs to
the mysterious agent. Ozone, which is carrying on its, at present, incomprehensible
effects' on the atmosphere, in order that they may be recorded r

    On a New Method of making Maximum Self- Registering Thermometers.
By John Phillips, M.A., F.R.S., Reader in Geology in the JJniversity of Oxford.

   Thermometers constructed after this plan were first exhibited by Prof. Philfips,
accompanied by a description, at the Oxford Meeting of the Association in 1832.
In consequence of a careful examination by Mr. Welsh, of the principle on which
they were arranged, attention was again called to the subject. The principle of the
instrument is the employment of a certain portion of the column of mercury, detached
as a marker. The length of this is capable of a great range of adaptation, to suit
the objects of experiment ; when set to work, the instrument is independent of
change, by time or chemical action, and as delicate in operation and as free from
error as the best ordinary thermometer can be made. Mr. Phillips constructed
many twenty-five years since, some of which remain in excellent state to this day.
The length of the marker was varied at pleasure, by means of a second hollow ball
blown at the extremity opposite the ball containing mercury. The longer this marker
is left, the easier is its flow : at a certain small length, depending on the diameter of the
tube, it will remain without turning in any position, and requires strong shaking to
change its place. Mr. Welsh constructed some in a manner superior to that for-
merly employed by Prof. Phillips, and reported in very favourable terms on the
accuracy and permanency of the instrument. Thus encouraged, Mr. Casella had
undertaken to adapt the thermometer to diflferent purposes in meteorology and philo-
sophical research, but without changing in any degree the essential character of the

instrument. Among the examples on the table was one which was planned by Prof.

Phillips for special researches on limited sources, or areas, of heat, with small bulb,

fine bore, and short detached marking column. Thus made, the thermometer may be

used in any position, vertical, inclined, or horizontal, and the short detac/ied marking

column will retain its place with such firmness that instruments may be carried far,
or even agitated much, without losing the registration.

Observations ivith the Aneroid M^tallique and Thermometer, during a Tour

   through Palestine, and along the shores of the Dead Sea, October and
   November 1855. By Henry Poole.

   During a recent tour through Palestine,! carried an Aneroid Metallique, and though
I would not presume to say that the results of observations made with it are quite
correct, yet as the readings in many instances are close approximations to the cal-
culations of Lynch and other travellers, I wish to draw attention to that instrument
as affording an easy mode of obtaining approximate levellings of heights in unsur-
veyed countries. It is light, and can be easily carried by a strap over the shoulder.
From the rackwork being visible, a readjustment can easily be made when required
upon ascending high mountains.

  A table of corrections is, however, required, and which I found must be additive

with an increase of temperature (being the reverse of mercurial barometers and
vacuum aneroids), as indicated by the variation in the readings at different tempera-
tures at the same localities, as recorded in the accompanying Table.

    In Dent's tables, 85 feet are calculated for the difference of each tenth of an
inch of the barometer; this, multiplied by 39'37 inches, equal to a metre, gives 33'46

feet, or 33^ feet in common practice, as the multiple of each division in the Aneroid

Metallique. In practice I found it very nearly correct; for instance, there are forty-

seven steps with a 6-inch rise going down into the Tomb of the Virgin Mary in the

Valley of Jehosophat equals 23*5 feet, and by aneroid I read a difference of 7 milli-
metres X by 33"5=23"45 feet ; again, the minaret of the Church of Ascension on

--the top of the Mount of Olives measured 36'5 feet, by aneroid the difference was

II millims. X 33"5=:36'85 feet. If the aneroid were mounted with a vernier scale,
the observations could be more closely read off. I particularly mention these com-
parisons of the aneroid with actual measurements, as they gave me confidence in it
at the time, and also because I found on my return to London that I had arrived
very nearly to the same results as Lieut. Lynch up to 2000 feet above the level of
the Mediterranean Sea; and also in the depression of the Dead Sea, 1313"5 feet by
aneroid, while Lynch made it 1316'7 feet by level, and Capt. Symonds calls it 1312
feet. There is also a variation in the line of the Dead Sea level at different seasons
--42 REPORT 1856.

Emof the year, for I found at Ras  Barghek three distinct lines of drift-wood one

above the other ; opposite Usdum the line of salt incrustations was 40 yards, and

the line of drift 70 yards distant from the edge of the sea ; while along the west side
of the peninsula " El Lisan," a reef of rocks was exposed about a quarter of a mile

distant from the shore, which does not appear to have been noticed by Lieut. Lynch's

party                             I therefore think I must have been there when the water was unusually low.
                               ;

I found the temperature of the Dead Sea at the north end 82░ Fahr. at 5 a.m., and

83░ Fahr. at the south end at 4 p.m. River Jordan, and brooks on the Lisan, and at

the Ghor, 64░ each. Brine spring 90░, where Lebia were caught near the sea-shore.

Wady Ern Barghek, temperature 76░. Spring at Engedi, 83░. At Ain Terabeh the sea

was 80░; also a brine spring close to the shore, and the freshwater spring was 79░: in it

were a number of Lebia swimming about, the largest appearing to be about 3 inches.

A sulphurous smell was observed on passing the white hills south of Sebbeh near

Wady El Mahras, at Birket el Khalil, but not at other places. It often blew hard

during the day, but the waves never appeared to be more than two feet high, and the

sea quickly went down after the wind ceased. Several nights were quite calm, but

I never observed any phosphorescence on the water.

The table of observations with the dry- and wet-bulb thermometer were made by

the same instrument, as unfortunately I had broken two others, and there were not

any to be bought in Jerusalem; I therefore obtained the lower or wet-bulb tempera-

tures by wetting the bulb, and waving the instrument about in the shade. The

vapour arising from the Dead Sea, when looked at from the heights of Ain jidi and

Ghomran, had the same appearance as the fumes produced at brass castings.

              On a Meteor seen at Cheltenham on Friday, August 8th.
                            By the Rev. C. Pritchard, F.R.S.

    The author stated, that on leaving the Meeting of the Association on Friday
evening, about 8 p.m., the friend who was with him suddenly exclaimed, "There is
lightning !" But observing that the light continued, he turned round, and saw a

--beautiful meteor moving, nearly in a vertical circle, nearly through a. Lyree, com-
--mencing about eight diameters of moon below a Lyrae, and extending* through about

ten diameters, commencing, in fact, in a line drawn through Jupiter and the lower
of the three stars in Aquila. It was very decided and persistent, with rose-coloured

Noscintillations, taking a serpentine course, and lasting for fully forty seconds.

--further meteors were observed that night ; but on the following night he observed six

others, about the same hour, all having their vanishing points near, or below, the
horizon, and, in the vertical circle, through a Lyree. The former meteor was seen
by other friends, and also at Tewkesbury, and its decided persistency and violet
colour remarked upon at the time.

the appearance of the hull of a ship, with the white planks all distinct from stem to

          On a Thermometer for Measuring Fluctuations of Temperature.
         By B. Stewart. Communicated and described by Mr. Welsh.

   If a bulb be blown between two thermometric glass tubes of unequal bores, and
the instrument be filled with mercury in the same manner as an ordinary thermo-
meter, and laid horizontal or nearly so, it will be found that contractions from cold
take place only in the narrow bore, and expansions from heat only in the wide one.
The reason of this seems to be, that while the temperature remains the same the
mercury is kept at rest, and prevented from retreating from the small bore into the
bulb, by friction ; but when a motive force is supplied by a change of temperature,
the motion of the mercury takes place in that direction in which it is most aided
by capillary action. It was suggested by Mr. Welsh to the author that such an
instrument might be used to measure fluctuations of temperature. And the author
thinks it might be applied to measure with exactness the power of a source of
radiant heat ; for, by alternately interposing a screen between this instrument and
the source of heat, and withdrawing the same screen, the effect of the source on the
mercury would be multiplied by the number of times this operation was performed.
In constructing such an instrument, care must be taken that the tubes used are quite
free from dirt or moisture, and that they are not bent, but form one straight line, the
bulb being in the middle, and swelling out symmetrically from both its extremities.
The best proportion between the capacities of the bores is perhaps about 1 to 4, and
the best arrangement of bores seems to be one suggested by Mr. Welsh, viz. a
round bore for the wide tube, and a flat or elliptical bore for the narrow one, the
 greatest diameter of which equals the diameter of the wide bore. In graduating, if,
 when the instrument is vertical, the narrow bore being beneath, the mercury fills
              --

the bulb and rises in the wide bore, then the wide bore may be pointed off at differ-

ent temperatures like an ordinary thermometer ; but if under these circumstances
the mercury does not rise in the wide bore, then, in order to point off the wide
bore, the instrument must be laid horizontally in a dish of water, and compared
with a standard thermometer at different temperatures ; the extremity of the

mercury in the narrow bore being always kept at a fixed point. When the
wide bore has been pointed off, we may, by running the mercury along, find

what length of the narrow bore corresponds to a certain length of the wide
one, and thus be enabled to point off the narrow bore. In using the instrument
it should be kept nearly horizontal, and there is probably for each instrument a
small range of inclination, for every position within which its peculiar action holds,
but beyond which it is interfered with by gravity. Before graduating such an instru-
ment it should be ascertained whether it is likely to answer, and the best test
seems to be to lay it horizontal, exposing it to changes of temperature of the same
nature with those which it is intended afterwards to measure;-- if its action be per-
fect, the mercury will eventually be found to have retreated into the bulb from Ihe
narrow bore ; but should it have stopped at any point, the action will only be
perfect up to that point. If this demands too much time, it may be tested by
repeatedly applying to the bulb of an instrument so placed a few drops of slightly
warmed water.

      On the Climate of Torquay and South Devon. By E. Vivian, M.A.

    Mr. E. Vivian, of Torquay, laid before this Section the statistics of the meteoro-
logy of Torquay and South Devon contrasted with those of the average of England,
as given in the Reports of the Registrar-General, to which he is a contributor. The
observations on which they were based extended from 1842 to 1856, but the com-
parative statement was confined to the last six years. The following was the
general summary :

Instructions for the Graduation of Boiling-point Thermometers, intendedfor
                    the Measurement of Heights. By J. Welsh.

   Let the thermometer be in the first instance filled with a suiRcient quantity of
mercury to allow the point 82░ Fahr. to be where the point 212░ is desired ulti-
mately to be. Let a chamber be made at the top of the tube about 3 inches

above the point 212░ ; or, if the thermometer is required to have a chamber at the
top when finally completed, let there be two chambers made with sufficient space

between them to allow of the tube being there sealed by a blowpipe flame. By

comparison with a standard thermometer, set off the points 82░, 72░, 62░, 52░,

42░ (but not 32░). The scale may then be divided, adopting the mark 82 as

corresponding  to  212-00                             72  to  20r87  ;  62  to  19174  ;  52  to  181-61  ;  42  to  171-48.
                                                   ;

The graduation of the scale should then be verified by comparison with a standard

thermometer at different points from 37░ to 87░ Fahr., and a table of errors of

Agraduation thus obtained.                                sufficient quantity of mercury must now be separated

from the main mass until the top of the column stands in boiling water at the

proper reading. The superfluous mercury having been lodged in the upper chamber,
may be removed by sealing up the tube between the two chambers. If it is not

possible to detach exactly the proper quantity of mercury to make the column stand

at the true temperature of boiling water, the difference should be added as a further

constant correction to the table already found by comparison with the standard. The

following determination of the corrections to a thermometer, constructed on this

--principle by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra, will serve as an example of the accuracy

which may be attained by this method.

 ' As the presence of zinc was the source of very great injury to the iron-master, not
only in consequence of its forming incrustations, but also on account of a certain
quantity of it finding its way into the cast iron and thereby rendering it very brittle,
1 was requested by the proprietor of these furnaces to examine the various mate-
rials that were employed, and try to find out in which of them existed the compound
of zinc which gave rise to these several incrustations.

   Having failed to discover any blende or calamine in the limestone used, I next
examined the iron ores, and found that the ' under penny-stone ' (a name given ia
Shropshire to the ironstone nodules which are employed there nearly exclusively) con-
tained small black crystals, which proved, on analysis, to be sulplmret of zinc or blende.

   Since this observation was made by me, E. W. Binney, Esq., F.R.S., has placed a
very interesting paper in my hands (published in 1852), in which he describes the

presence of the sulphurets of lead and zinc " as existing in the druses or hollows of
ironstone nodules occurring in coal-measures, which seem to indicate that metals
had in some instances been precipitated from aqueous solutions, or segregated from

semifluid masses."
   But it would appear probable, from the recent researches of Messrs. Fremy,

Deville, and Senarmont, that the blende has formed itself in the druses by the action
of a volatile sulphuret on the oxide of zinc which had been deposited in those druses
after they had been formed in the ironstone.

   In examining the coals employed, I found in the lowest strata which bear the name
of "Court Bandies Coal" in the neighbourhood of Coalbrook Dale, a large quantity
of white metallic scales disseminated through the mass of coals, exactly in the same
manner as pyrites are observed in the same substance. The presence of such scales
having not yet been observed, I analysed them, and found them to be composed of
galena mixed with a little blende.

   I think that the pi'esence of the blende and galena in the iron mineral and in the
coals, clearly indicates that in the neiglibourhood there must be veins or lodes of the
sulphurets of these two metals.

On the Salts actually present in the Cheltenham and other Mineral Waters.
                        By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S.

The Cheltenham waters have been analysed by many distinguished chemists, and

the experiments of Messrs. Abel and Rowney leave nothing to be desired in point of

accuracy, that is to say, as far as the amounts of chlorine, carbonic acid, soda, lime,

&c. are concerned ; but the author contended that the usual method of arranging the

results of analysis, as so much chloride of sodium, so much carbonate of lime, &c.,

was utterly fallacious. The rule of ' combining the strongest base with the strongest

acid ' is purely empirical, and almost incapable of application, since our knowledge is

very vague as to which is stronger and which weaker ; but the rule is also false, if it
be true, as the author has found it to be wherever proof was possible, that " where

two or more binary compounds are mixed under such circumstances that all the

resulting bodies are free to act and react, each electro-positive element arranges itself

in combination with each electro-negative element in certain constant proportions."

The method of determining the salts actually present in a water by evaporating it

down and exhausting the residue successively with aether, alcohol and water, is also

fallacious, for the state of combination of the acids and bases may materially alter

when crystallization is taking place.

The paper of Messrs. Abel and Rowney contains indications that the salts are not

actually present in the Cheltenham waters in the manner in which they are arranged

in their lists of analyses. Thus so carefully had these chemists experimented, that

they observed there was not sufficient free carbonic acid to retain in solution the lime

and magnesia which, according to the usual principles, they supposed present in the

form of carbonates. Hence they imagined them dissolved by the alkaline salts, and

Weadd, "  have satisfied ourselves by direct experiment, that the solubility of car-

bonate of lime is much increased by the presence of chloride of sodium and sulphate

Nowof soda."  all this is the necessary consequence of the law of reciprocal aflinity,

as the lime, instead of monopolizing the carbonic acid, will unite more or less with the

other acids present, forming salts soluble in water.

The author was fully aware that analytical chemists themselves did not profess the

                                                      4*

method complained of to be absolutely correct ; but be feared that tlie semi-scientific
and the general public were deceived by it, and that chemists also often came to
believe there was some truth in their own arbitrary mode of expressing the results of

analysis.

         Notes on Nitroglycerine. By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S.
   The author had made several observations on this remarkable explosive li(^uid,
\vliich had been iirst exhibited by Dr. De Vrij at the Ipswich meeting of the Associa-

tion ; but the recent research of Mr. Railton had forestalled him, and left little for
him to bring before the public. However, he felt convinced that nitroglycerine was
not always uniform in its properties, and was perhaps various in its composition.
Tlius a liquid produced by immersing glycerine (in the hydrated state in which it is
found in commerce) in a mixture of one part of fuming nitric acid and three parts of
sulphuric acid, was found to be easily exploded by a blow with a hammer, or when
heated rather strongly in a test-tube, giving rise to much flame and noise, with the
evolution of much nitrous gas ; while a liquid produced in a precisely similar manner
from the same glycerine, but after it had been rendered anhydrous, did not explode
by a blow with a hammer, and burnt without noise when very strongly heated.
Again, some explosive nitroglycerine was allowed to decompose spontaneously till only
about one-half was left; this remaining portion was non-explosive. Each variety,
when exposed to a bath of solid carbonic acid in alcohol, froze, becoming at first viscous,
and then assuming an appearance similar to that of the fatty acids at the ordinary
temperature. This substance, like other nitrous acid substitution products, is liable
to slow spontaneous decomposition. This had been several times observed : one spe-
cimen exposed for some weeks to the light of the summer sun, gave off abundance of
red fumes, and separated into two liquids, between which long crystals of oxalic acid
formed. The upper liquid contained the products of decomposition, being in fact
an aqueous solution of nitric and oxalic acids, with a large quantity of ammonia, a
little prussic acid, and traces of two or three slightly acid or neutral bodies, which

coidd not be identified.

       On the Conversion of Tannin into Gallic Acid. By John Hoesley.
    It is several years since I first noticed the facts which 1 now bring before j'our

notice. I have never yet heard or read cf the practical application of the agent in
the manufacture of gallic acid in the manner I now suggest.

    Every chemist is aware that the quantity of gallic acid naturally contained in the
gall-nut is very small compared with the tannin (alias tannic acid), and that the gallic
acid of commerce is a manufactured article, being obtained by what is called the fer-
mentation process, which consists in the saturation of the braised galls with water
and exposing the mass to the air for a period of several weeks or even months, when
decomposition sets in, a mould collects, and small yellov.' crystals of gallic acid are
observable, evidently the result of the oxidation of the tannin. The gallic acid is
then dissolved out by boiling the mass in water, and crystallizes from the concentrated
liquid on cooling.

   It occurred to me to make experiments by keeping powdered galls in contact for
some time with liquid acids, such as sulphuric, sulphurous, nitric, and acetic acids,

but with diluted sulphuric acid only did I perceive any change produced ; small
иwhite tufts or nodules of gallic acid being observed soon to protrude themselves, so to
speak, to the surface of the dried cake,

    I have lately, for the purpose of drawing up this paper, made further experiments,
of which these are specimens. I merely moistened the powdered galls with the diluted
acid and exposed the mixture in an evaporating dish to the full action of the sun, and
in a few hours signs of intestine motion began to manifest themselves and crystalline
white tufts were forming ; these white tufts gradually increased from day to day, and
became more apparent as the mass dried. It is necessary to renew the application
of moisture from time to time, so as to promote the growth of gallic acid.

    In proof of the above, I likewise treated ^?╗-e tannin by triturating it with dilute

     A New Method of instituting post-mortem researches for Strychnia.

                                       By John Horsley.

   The following will be found an exceedingly simple and successful method of
obtaining strychnia, in cases where it is practicable, from the tissues of the body.

   The weather at the time of making these experiments being very hot, the effluvia
evolved from so much putrefying animal matter-, induced me to adopt some means
for remedying the annoyance. I therefore thought of a solution of ordinai-y chloride
of lime (bleaching liquid), but fearing lest that agent should decompose or destroy
the strychnia, I first tried its effect on a weak acetic solution of strychnia, and was
surprised to find that a milky white precipitate of a chloride, possibly a hypochlorite
of strychnia, ensued, insoluble even on the addition of a large quantity of acetic acid.
This precipitate, when drained on a filter and dried, is freely soluble in alcohol, which
seems to be its best spirituous solvent, but did not readily dissolve in dilute sulphuric

acid even with the aid of heat. Its best acid solvent is glacial acetic acid. It is also

soluble in alkaline liquors.

   This result gave me such confidence, that I at once proceeded to operate on animal

matter. I therefore took some of the putrid liquid in which the liver of a dog

poisoned by strychnia had been boiled, which liver had not hitherto yielded me any

strychnia. I purposely introduced a little of the alkaloid, boiled the whole a few
minutes, and when cold, added the liquid chloride of lime in excess, or till all soluble
matter (animal or otherwise) was precipitated, and then filtered it through a cloth.

No trace of bitterness could be detected in the liquor.
   The drained precipitate of fibrine, gelatine, caseine, and strychnia was next dried

in a water-bath, then powdered, digested in alcohol acidified with acetic acid, heated,
filtered, and evaporated to the consistency of a syrup : by this time the whole of the
smell of chlorine will have been given off, and acetate of strychnia obtained, which
can be purified in the usual way, by precipitation with an alkali, &c.

               Testing for Strychnia, Brucia, 8(C. By John Horsley.

   The author tried the effects of a precipitant formed of one part of bichromate of
potash dissolved in fourteen parts of water, to which were added afterwards two
parts in bulk of strong sulphuric acid, upon a solution of strychnine, which was entirely
precipitated in the form of a beautiful golden-coloured insoluble chromate. The
decolorizat'wn of a solution of either the chromate or bichromate of potash was effected
by gradually adding a solution of the acetate of strychnia, when chromate of strychnia
was precipitated. Scarcely a trace of bitterness was left in the filtered liquor.

   The author claimed as his own, this mode of the application of the chromic salt
and the acid. He diluted thirty drops of a solution containing half a grain of strychnia
with four drachms of water. When six drops of a solution of bichromate of potash were
added, at each drop crystals were at once formed, and the decomposition was complete
when the whole were mixed together. Though the half-grain of strychnia was split
up into millions of atomic crystals, each atom as effectually demonstrated the chemical
properties of the poison as a pound in weight could have done. The chemical reaction
with these crystals was next shown by spreading out a drop of the liquid chromate of
strychnia upon an evaporating dish, and adding a drop or two of strong sulphuric acid.

   Amorphous chromate of strychnia may be obtained from neutral chromate of

potash; nacreous or crystalline, from the bichromate; and, thirdly, in the regular
crystalline state with a wealc chromic acid solution : fine spiculas are first formed, and
next (which is the peculiar characteristic of strychnia) small cubic crystals studding

the sides of the glass.

   The salts of brucia and of lead alone appear to afford results in anywise similar.
The chromates of strychnia and of brucia become (contrary to that of lead) dark
coloured by exposure to sunlight.

   Chromate of strychnia is changed to deep purple, and then to violet and red on appli.
cation of sulphuric acid. But chromate of brucia shows only an orange-red colour
and being more soluble, no crystals can be obtained by means of the weak acid
solution mentioned. Chromate of lead also is in the amorphous or powdery state, and
developes no colour with sulphuric acid.

   The following new tests disprove the fallacy entertained, that the non-detection
of strychnia in the body of J. P. Cooke was owing to the presence of antimonj'.

   Mix one part of a saturated solution of the yellow cyanide of potassium (12 grains

thirty drops of solution of strychnia diluted with sixty or ninety drops of water ; drop in

dance of minute yellowish-white crystals of the ferrocyanide of strychnia is formed.

dered protosulphate   of iron ;  drench  both with  water                             the  deep  blue  of the iron                              is  first

On a New Method of extracting the Alkaloids Strychnia and Bruciafrom
             Nux Vomica without Alcohol. By John Horsley.

   The usual modes of obtaining strychnia from nux vomica are, besides being more
or less expensive owing to the alcohol used, far from satisfactory. This, in a toxico-
logical point of view, is particularly the case, on account of the small quantity of
strychnia naturally contained in the nut ; and as the production of the alkaloid for its
characteristic colour-test is a matter of importance, I have been induced to make
several exi^eriments on the different methods in use, and it appears to me that the
simplest and best is that which I now propose, viz. to make an acetic extract by
kneading up, say a quarter of a pound of nux vomica with an equal quantity of com-
mercial acetic acid, and thinning the pulpy mass with two or three pints of cold water,
allowing it to digest for a few days. The clear liquor must then be decanted oflP and
an equal quantity of fresh water poured on the mass to digest for a day or two longer,
or till all soluble matter is extracted. The clear liquor is then to be decanted, and
the remainder thrown on a flannel filter. The liquid which passes through should
be mixed with the former decanted liquors and evaporated to a syrupy consistence
(about three or four ounces). When this is cold, dilute it with an equal quantity of
water, add liquor ammonite in excess, and set it by for a day or two that the strychnia
may crystallize out, which is known by the various little white tufts which collect
within the fluid as well as on the sides of the glass vessel. When the crystallization

is complete, the dark green supernatant fluid is to be passed through a calico filter
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and the residuum with the crystals adhering to the vessel collected thereon, must be
left to drain; the dark green mass consisting of strychnia and brucia with resinoid

matter is next to be scraped otf and well dried in a water-bath, digested in hot diluted

acetic acid, and the solution filtered. The strychnia and brucia may be thrown down

by potassa, or the strychnia only by the addition of a solution of chromate of potassa,
when a chromate of strychnia will be obtained free from brucia provided the solution

which retains the brucia be tolerablj' acid.
   This chromate of strychnia being collected on a filter and well drained, can easily

be (Zechromatized by digestion in liq. ammonise, and the strychnia obtained of a more

or less snowy whiteness.

The quantity of strychnia actually contained in the nux vomica has not, I believe,

been accurately ascertained, at least if I may judge from Professor Taylor's work on

Poisons, where that gentleman represents it at about ^f^j or i a grain per cent. I
cannot help thinking that the exhaustion in that case must have been but imperfectly

performed, as my own experiments show that nearly twice that quantity is capable of
being extracted; for in my first concentration of the liquor from a quarter of a pound

of nux vomica I obtained as follows :

                   From the 1st concentration 11 grains of strychnia

                      ╗ 2nd              ,,          4,,

                      ╗ 3rd              ,,          2,,

                                                                           17 grains.
   This difference in quantity is necessary to be borne in mind by the medical prac-
titioner when prescribing the extract and other preparations of nux vomica.

Experiments on Animals with Strychnia, and probable reasons for the non-

detection of the Poison in certain cases. By John Hoksley.

The author next related his experiments on three white rats with strychnine. To

each rat was given a quarter of a grain of powdered strychnia. In little more than

an hour a quarter-grain dose was given to the largest rat, and in about another hour
half a grain more was given to the same animal. At 4 o'clock the next morning

they were all alive, having eaten bread and milk, but shortly after 7 o'clock they

were all dead, one having lived just twelve hours after taking the quarter-grain dose.

    In about three hours afterwards not the least indication of strychnine could be
obtained by the usual tests, and all traces of bitterness were lost. Every portion of
their bodies gave the same negative results. Was, then, the strychnia decomposed in

the organism, and its nature changed, as Liebig intimated ?
   The strychnine might have been absorbed into the albumen or other solid animal

matter, and thus abstracted from the fluid, forming perhaps by coagulation in the

blood, a solid albuminate as in the case of the glairy white of egg with strychnia, the

full quantity of the alkaloid not being recoverable.
    In his second experiment the author gave full three-quarters of a grain to a wild

rat, which was killed by a dog four or five days afterwards, exhibiting but little of

the effects of the poison ; the palms of the feet having cedematous swellings, and one
of the fore-feet being contracted. In the third experiment, Mr. H. gave a pill of two
grains of strychnia wrapped in blotting-paper, to a full-sized terrier dog. It was ap-
parently well for at least five hours, but in the morning was found dead, as though

asleep. When taken up, blood flowed freely from its mouth. The right ventricle

and auricle of the heart contained no blood ; the left was full of partly liquid, partly

clotted blood. The stomach was detached with both orifices closed. On incision,

the paper wrapper, so far from being reduced to a pulp by the action of the stomach,
was found in the same state as when the pill was given, and contained nearly all the

strychnine.

None of the absorbed strychnia could be detected in the blood or elsewhere after

the most careful experiments.
   Mr. H. subsequently made experiments proving the great probability that a more

or less insoluble compound of organic or animal matter is found in combination with

strychnia.   _____^

On the Detection of Strychnine. By Stevenson Macadam, Ph.D., F.R.S.E.,

    F.C.S., Lecturer on Chemistry in the Medical School, Surgeons' Hall; in the
    School of Arts ; and to the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, Edin-

    burgh.

    Four points were sought to be determined by the present investigation.
   (1) Can strychnine which has been administered as a poison be thereafter detected
in the animal systean ?
    (2) Will antimony, morphine, coniine, or other chemical agent, conceal strychnine,
when such has been given to the animal ?
    (3) Will time, with its host of putrefying agents, so far destroy strychnine as to

render its detection unlikely or impossible 1 And
   (4) Can strychnine which has been given to the animal in minimum doses remain

in its organism in such quantity as afterwards to be isolated and recognized?
    In examining animal matter for strychnine, the author has found the following

process eminently serviceable, and confidently commends it to the notice of analysts
as a method which can be depended upon. The animal matter, when solid, is chopped
into minute fragments, and treated with a dilute solution of oxalic acid. After stand-
ing twenty-four hours, during which time the mass is repeatedly agitated, the whole
is filtered through muslin. The contents of the filter are well washed with water, and
the washings added to the filtrate. The liquid so obtained is heated to ebullition,
when albuminous matters separate, and whilst warm, is filtered through paper. Ani-
--56 ' REPORT 1856.

mal charcoal is added to the filtrate, and, after repeated agitation during twenty-four

hours, the supernatant liquid is decanted off, and the charcoal received on a paper
filter, where it is well washed with cold water. The charcoal now retaining the
strychnine is allowed to dry spontaneously, thereafter placed in a flask, drenched

with alcohol, and the whole kept for two hours at a temperature short of ehullition.

The alcoholic extract is separated by filtration from the charcoal, and is evaporated
down to dryness in a porcelain vessel, at a water-bath heat. The residue so obtained
will generally be found in a fit condition to be at once tested for strychnine, by means

of bichromate of potash and sulphuric acid; but should such not be the case, a few

drops of oxalic acid solution are again added, and the process repeated from the action
of charcoal onwards. Proceeding in this manner, the author has many times suc-
ceeded in detecting strychnine in the various organs of an animal destroyed by means

of it. In a few instances, hydrochloric acid and acetic acid were severally employed

instead of the oxalic acid, but were found unsuitable. Tartaric acid, however, gives

results equally successful with those yielded by oxalic acid.

   When this investigation commenced, it was still an open question as to the possi-

bility of strychnine being absorbed and retained in the animal system. Accordingly,

in the first trials, large doses were gradually given, so aa to afford every chance of the

strychnine being afterwards found.

   A Horse received 24 grains of strychnine in small doses at repeated intervals during

one hour and fifty minutes, when a large dose of 12 grains was given. Tetanus

came on in two hours from the commencement of the experiment, and the animal

died in one minute thereafter. Strychnine was detected in (1) the contents of the

stomach, (2) the muscle, (3) the blood, and (4) the urine.

  A large Police Dog partook of four bread pills, each coi>taining ^\th of a grain of

strychnine, at intervals of about a quarter of an hour each. In fifteen minutes after-

wards 3 grains of strychnine were given, and in other fifteen minutes another dose of

3 grains. Tetanic spasms commenced in one hour and forty-five minutes after the

first dose was administered, and the animal died in thirteen minutes. Strychnine was

found in (1) the intestines, (2) the blood, (3) urine, and (4) muscle. The other

parts of this animal were not examined.

Three Mice were poisoned with strychnine by the author's assistant, Mr. John J. J,

Kyle, who afterwards examined them according to Stas'pi-ocess, substituting chloroforn;

for ether. He detected the alkaloid in the stomachs and intestines thrown together,

but not in the muscle and other organs.

The suggestion lately advanced, that antimony and other substances are capable of

destroying, retaining, or concealing strychnine, when such has been administered as

a poison, does not seem to possess any foimdation. A White Dog which had been

under treatment with tartar emetic for foiu* days, receiving four 3:th of a grain doses

each day, was poisoned with 1 grain of strychnine, and died in forty minutes; and,

Awhen tested, the poison was found in every organ. Black Dog, similarly treated with

tartar emetic, received IJ grain of strychnine along with 12 grains of extract of hem-

lock, died in one hour and two minutes, and when examined yielded evidence of the

Apoison having passed into nearly every part of its system.  Terrier Dog, poisoned

Aby I5 grain strychnine and 3 drops coniine, gave the same positive result.        Cat,

to which half a grain of strychnine and 2 grains of muriate of morphia were given, died

in fifty-six minutes, and afforded evidence of strychnine in six different parts.

The effect of time in causing the destruction of the strychnine has also occupied the

attention of the author. Several parts of the Horse which had been buried for four

weeks, as also other parts which had lain above ground for three weeks, including the

stomach itself, and which were in an advanced stage of decomposition, on being tested,

Ashowed the presence of stiychnine.      Dnck also poisoned by strychnine, and which

lay above ground for three and a half weeks (by whicli time maggots in abundance

were crawling in and through it), yielded strychnine. Further, the remains of a Dog

destroyed two and a half years ago by strychnine, as also those of another Dog poi-

soned three and a half years agoby tlie same substance, still yielded satisfactory indi-

cations of the agent by means of which they came by their death.

As strychnine, like other organic substances, is liable to change in the animal

system, it is of imjiortance to know how far minimum doses may be given which in days

Amay prove fatal and yet be thereafter discovered.  Skye Terrier veceived |^th of

a grain of strycliiune, was seized with tetanus in three hours, died in twelve hours,
and notwithstanding the smalhiess of the dose, and the length of time the vital powers
could act upon it, yet strychnine was satisfactorily discovered in all the more im-
portant organs. Again, a Terrier Dog was fed on the flesh of the hoi-se for four-

teen days, received each day 2 lbs. of food undoubtedly containing strychnine, lived
and thrived on the poisoned flesh, and when afterwards destroyed by strychnine (un-
fortunately so), yielded such a comparatively large proportion of strychnine, that the
author came to the conclusion that this excess of strychnine must have been stored up
in the tissues of the animal whilst it was partaking of the flesh of the horse, containing

the minimum of minimum of doses of strychnine.
   In summing up these remarks on the detection of strychnine, the author deduces

from the results of the experiments, the following conclusions :
   (1) That, when administered to the animal, strychnine is absorbed and retained

in its system.
    (2) That strychnine is not sensibly destroyed in the animal system during life, nor

by the partial decomposition of the animal tissue consequent on death.

   (3) That minimum doses of strychnine may cause the animal to exhibit but par-

tially, or not at all, the physiological effects, but such dosss are the most favourable

for the chemist ; so that, as the physiological evidence decreases, or sinks to a mini-

mum, the chemical proof increases or rises to a maximum.
   (4) That tartar emetic, muriate of morphia, extract of hemlock, and coniine, may

retard or relieve the spasms, but they do not in the slightest degree hinder the chemi-

cal isolation and detection of strychnine.

    (5) That, by proper treatment, strychnine can be separated from organized tissue

--and organic matter in general, as easily as any other poison arsenic not excepted

and much more easily than most other poisonous substances.
    (6) That, when isolated, strychnine can be distinguished by a special test, which

is unerring and most delicate, and which will detect the merest trace.
    (7) That the decomposition or natural decay of the animal frame may in ages cause

the complete destruction of the strychnine ; but in this, time will no more easily blot
out all traces of strychnine than it will obliterate the mark of the knife of the assassin.

   Sewer and cesspool water was distilled. The powerfully alkaline distillate was
supersaturated with hydrochloric acid, and precipitated with bichloride of platinum in
the usual manner. The resulting platinum salt was crystallized, and then burnt with
chromate of lead. The liberation of a large amount of carbonic acid proved the car-
boniferous character of the alkali. The platinum salt yielded the same per-centage
of platinum as the platlno-chloride of methylamine.

   By Reinsch's process, antimonial deposits upon copper can be obtained from solu-
tions which, on account of their dilution, are unaffected by sulphydric acid. The

и001th of a grain of dry tartar emetic, under a dilution of half a million times, gives

a complete metallic coating to one square inch of copper siu'face. By the same pro-
cess, other metals than antimony, arsenic, and mercury can be deposited as brilliant
metallic coatings upon copper. The characters of the various deposits, and the cir-
cumstances under which they form, vary somewhat. Cadmium precipitates copper
completely from cupric solutions; but, on the other hand, from cadmic solutions cad-
mium is readily preoipitable upon copper. The deposit of antimony upon copper is

       On Engraving Collodion Photographs by means of Fluoric Acid Gas.
                              By Charles Pooley, Cirencester.

   In this paper the author set forth the means he had adopted in order to obtain

engraved impressions of collodion photographs on glass. He divided the process into

four steps :

              1 St. The preparation of the plate.
              2nd. The treatment of the picture.
              3rd. The application of heat to the picture.
              4th. The exposure of the picture to the influence of fluoric acid gas.
   In the preparation of the plate, Mr. Pooley found it necessary to use new glass,
and strong collodion well iodized, and also to deposit as much pure silver as possible,
for which purpose he developed with protosulphate of iron and acetic acid, although
be thought other agents would answer the purpose equally well.
   The author tlien proceeded to show that the gi-eat obstacle he had to contend with,
was the presence of the film of collodion covering the glass; but this was overcome
by submitting the plate to a high temperature, which gave to the silver a white, frosted
appearance, and attenuated the film of collodion so much as to make it permeable to
the action of the gas. The picture was then exposed to the influence of the dry,
warm vapour of fluoric acid, and in 20 to 40 seconds the operation was completed.
    Having washed off the film, a fine etching becomes visible, so delicate in its mark-
ings, and yet so perfect, that the unassisted eye is unable to discern all its beauties.
It requires a lens to make out all the minutije of detail correctly.
    The author then adverted to a remarkable fact which he had observed in the
character of the engraved picture, namely, that the portions of the glass on which the
silver had been deposited were those on which the action of the gas first took place,
the vmsilvered parts being imafFected by it. This circumstance, which appears to be
 at variance with our notions of the ancient claims of fluoric acid for silica, opens a
new field for investigation. The author refrained from offering an explanation of

 this interesting question, but left it as a subject for future consideration.

    Immediately after the publication of M. Taupenot's process, I proceeded to experi-
 ment on it, under the impression that it possessed many advantages over the dry
 photographic processes then known, and that the further investigation of it was likely
 to lead to results of the highest interest, both practically and theoretically. In these
 respects I have not been disappointed, and I can most decidedly recommend the
 adoption of the process to all photographers, as well to those who are not afraid of a
 little trouble in the manipulation of preparing their own materials and plates, as to
 those who, preferring the artistic choice of subjects, would rather commit the prepara-
 tion and subsequent development of plates to assistants, or to professional photographers.

   I have to acknowledge the assistance of several friends. Members of the Leeds
Photographic Society, of whom some worked conjointly with me, and of others who
freely communicated to me their experience in working the albumen process.

The modification of tlie original process which I have adopted, consists, first, in

using only one bath for both the first and second sensitizing of the plate. This bath

is composed of about 35 grains of nitrate of silver per ounce, witli about 10 per cent,

of the commercial acetic acid known as Beaufoy's acid. Secondly, in nsing a very

fluid collodion somewhat highly iodized and not containing any bromide, and in using

albumen without any other addition than a bromide and sufficient water for its solu-

tion. I use about 4 grains of bromide of potassium for the white of each egg, but

the particular bromide, or the precise quantity, does not appear to be very material.

And, thirdly, in drying the coating of albumen by suspending the plate in a wire

cradle attached to a long thread over a heated iron plate, and keeping the prepared

glass plate in rapid rotation until dry, so as in the first instance to throw off the

superfluous albumen by the centrifugal force, and then to cause the plate to dry

equally from the centre.

I use a similar method of drying after the second sensitizing, but without heat if

the plates are to be kept more than a day or two.

By adopting these manipulations, I have been able to prepare plates up to 1 7 inches

by 13 as free from blemishes and with very little more trouble, than if collodion alone

had been used.

I have always preferred to develope the picture by gallic acid, using a cold, nearly

saturated solution, with the addition of about 4 minims per ounce of a solution of

nitrate of silver, 30 grains per ounce with about 30 minims of acetic acid, i. e. rather

less acidified than the bath solution. This generally developes the picture in about

an hour and a half; but if the picture be faint from over-exposure, or slow in developing

from under-exposure, an addition of double or treble the quantity of aceto-nitrate

Asolution should from time to time be added.  greater quantity of silver in the first

instance appears to retard the development.

Small plates may be more speedily developed by pyrogallic acid, but with large

plates I find gallic acid preferable, both on the score of economy, and that with pyro-

gallic acid constant care is required in watching the development and in preventing

the spoiling the result by a muddy deposit.

The theoretical advantages of this process appear to me to be, that, compared with

other processes, it permits quite as great, and I think a much greater latitude in the

time of exposure ; that whilst the rapidity is as great as can be desired (except for

the instantaneous efiects, which are only practicable with wet collodion), an exposure

for many hours or even days may be given for feebly illumined objects ; that the use

of an iodide in the collodion and a bromide in albumen, give a great increase of sen-

sibility, in like manner as the accelerating effect by the alternate use of iodine and

bromine in the Daguerreotype; that the image is formed on the plane on which the

combined films of collodion and albumen coalesce together, and where alone there is

a combination of iodide and bromide of silver; thus, although it is necessary that the

plates should be very carefully cleaned to prociue the perfect adherence of the film

of collodion, neither impurities on the surface of the glass plate, nor on the upper sur-

face of the albumen, are increased during the development of the image ; that the

drying the plates by heat prevents almost entirely the blistering of the plates, which

has been found so great a disadvantage in the process as published by M. Taupenot.

 --Note. Subsequent experiments have shown the use of a bromide alone in the

albumen to be fallacious.

    On a New Process for Making and Melting Steel. By P. J. Worsley.

   This process, invented by Dr. Gurlt, is interesting as an example of the method of
applying fuel, known as the gas-fuel method, by which the useful portions of the fuel
are brought to bear while all impurities are left behind. This latter advantage is
peculiarly applicable to iron and steel making, as the chief impurities in these metals
are derived from the fuel. Dr. Gurlt exposes iron-ore to a current of gas, of which a

at will. By applying gas-fuel to a reverberatory furnace, and blowing in air by pipes

over the bridge, a true blowpipe flame is obtained, by which the highest heat possible
is attained, and also by the regulation of the wind the atmosphere of the furnace

may be kept either neutral, oxidizing or reducing at will. With such a furnace
Dr. Gurlt hopes to melt steel in large quantity without injury to its quality. The gas
is obtained by burning the fuel in a close deep fire-box by means of a blast of air at

the bottom.

On Fossils from the Crimea. By William H. Baily, Geological Survey of

                                                   Great Britain.

The fossils which formed the subject of this communication belong, with one ex-

ception, to the [nvertebrata, and were principally collected in the southern part of the

Crimea, by Captain C. F. Cockburn, of the Royal Artillery. They comprise a series

from the Monastery of St. George and gorge of Iphigenia, consisting of fossils from

the Jurassic and oldest deposits ; also others from the tertiaries resting immediately

upon  them                            and  from  the volcanic  or  eruptive  rocks which have  disturbed and  broken
                                   ;

up some of these strata, together with a set of well-preserved newer tertiary Mollusca

from the Quarantine Harbour. The Museum of Practical Geology has also received

from Major Cooke, of the Royal Engineers, a suite of somewhat similar forms of

Steppe limestone fossils from the Redan, and near the dockyard of Sevastopol, and

some interesting Jurassic Brachiopoda from Balaklava. It possesses also from Lieu-

tenant-Colonel Munro, and Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Lygon Cocks, of the Cold-

stream Guards, other specimens of the Steppe limestone containing fossils, obtained

from the ground before Sevastopol, upon which the allied armies were encamped, and

volcanic and mineral specimens from the sea-coast.

These instructive collections, including a series of fossils from the various strata of

the Crimea, formerly presented by the Imperial School of Mines at St. Petersburgh,

enable us to add to the published lists of fossils from that country seventy-four

species.

  The geology of this peninsula having been described in detail by M. Du Bois de
Montpereux, M. Huot in the work of Demidoff, M. Hommaire de Hell, and by Sir
R. I. Murchison and M. de Verneuil in the ' Geology of Russia and the Ural Moun-

tains,' a slight sketch of the formations represented in that country only is necessary

before proceeding to the remarks upon the fossils.

   The most ancient deposits of the Crimea are those at the base of the Jurassic for-
mation, described as black schists, composed of hard, soft, and ferruginous beds, which

are probably equivalent to the Trias, or New Red Sandstone appearing in the Valley

of Baidar and other localities, and on the coast, where they are superimposed by the
Lias. Overlying the schists of the Lias are the Jurassic rocks, which extend along the

southern sea-coast from Balaklava to the vicinity of Theodosia or KafFa, a length of

about 100 miles. This mountain-chain of hard and crystalline limestones, pierced
and broken into by volcanic eruptions of greenstone, porphyry, &c., is, with its asso-
ciated strata, analogous to that of the Caucasus, and proceeds in a direction E.N.E. to
S.S.W., its highest point being the Tchatir Dagh or Tent Mountain, of an elevation
of 5135 feet. The Bay of Balaklava Is enclosed on both sides by steep and rugged
rocks of the Jurassic formation, composed of compact red and grey limestones, in
which are clefts filled with a reddish clay. These limestones and clays contain nume-
rous organic remains, the most abundant of which are corals and Encrinital joints.

   At the foot of the chain towards the north, the lower division of the Cretaceous
series, or " Ncocomien," may be well observed, its horizontal beds resting unconform-

aWy either upon the Jurassic limestones, or upon the shales at their base, the inter-
mediate subdivisions being absent. Upon these beds repose the Upper Cretaceous,

composed of shales (probably equivalent to the Gault), Upper greensand, Chalk marl,
and White chalk. On the eastern coast the Hippuritic and Senonian subdivisions

rest immediately on the disturbed Jurassic beds, the intermediate subdivisions being

absent. The Cretaceous series does not ocoipy much space in the Crimea, being

enclosed between the nummulitic deposits and the Jurassic limestone, taking the same
direction, and extending from KafTa to Cape Chersonese on the south-west coast. The

soft calcareous rock of Inkermann, from which the beautiful white stone used in con-

structing most of the public buildings of Sevastopol was obtained, is very easily
worked, but becomes harder and more durable by exposure to the atmosphere. From

comparison of its fossils, it appears to be identical with the Upper chalk.

The Lower Tertiarj' or Eocene is represented by the Nummulitic formation, which,

like the cretaceous series, is elevated by the mountainous region of the coast, and dis-
posed in long bands following its contour. This formation commences in the environs

of Theodosia, continuing to the north, near to Karas-ubazar, Simferopol, and Baktchi

Serai, terminating at the south-west coast near Sevastopol.

The Upper Tertiary formation includes the older and newer Caspian or Steppe

limestone, the former of wliich subdivisions, or older Caspian, occupies the northern

and greater portion of the peninsula at Eupatoria, Sevastopol, &c., including the

chief limestones round Kertch, and the deposits of the cliffs of Kamiesch Boroun

and Taman. These limestones and sands, associated in some localities with volcanic

ashes, tufa, &c., occur in various conditions as shelly and oolitic limestones of marine
and freshwater origin, being more or less fossiliferous. The Heracleotic Chersonesus

is, as it were, a shred of the Steppe limestone ; the Bay of Sevastopol exhibiting a
succession of formations from the most recent of these tertiaries through the nummu-

litic limestone and chalk. The newer Caspian occupies the still more northern extre-

mity of the Crimea, extending to Perekop, Kherson, and the shores of the Sea of Azof.

The environs of Kertch and Taman are the most favourable localities to observe its
characters, and here the fossils are in good preservation. The existence of coal has

been often rumoured, but on examination the supposed coal has proved to be lignite

of very ordinary quality.

Deposits of hydrate and phosphate of iron have been met with near to Kertch,

ATaman, and other parts of the Crimea.  foundry was formerly established near

Kertch, and the iron was worked by M. GouriefE From an analysis by Hussein

Effendi, of the Government School of Mines, it gave but 19-234 per cent.

each formation was read, viz. :                                                                Known       New

                             Remarks on the Fossils.

On referring to the table of Jurassic fossils, it was shown that the most numerous

classes represented in the Crimea from that formation are the Zoopliyta, Brachiopoda,

and Cephalopoda-^the Conchifera and Gasteropoda being the fewest. In the lowest

-- --class, the Amorphozoa a group of rare occurrence in this formation a new form of

Sponge has been collected by Capt. Cockburn, from the red Jurassic limestone near

the Monastery of St. George. Of the Zoophyta nearly all the specimens received

have been identified with species found in the coralline and inferior oolite of this

country. The Echinodermata are principally spines belonging to the genus Cidaris

with these are joints of crinoids (Apiocrinites) from near Balaklava, and portions of

stems of Pentacrinites from the interior of the Crimea. Of the Brachiopoda, the cha-

--racteristic lias species, Terehraiula numismaUs, has been obtained from Woronzoff
Road.  Four are new species  two of these belonging to the genus Rhi/nchonella
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

others of the same genus have been identified with inferior oolite and marlstone spe-

cies. In the lias shales of the Woronzoff Road were found several specimens of a

bivalve, identified with Astarte complanata (Roemer), together with a new form of

Cardium allied to an inferior oolite species. The Gasteropoda are represented only

by a large species of Natica from the red limestone near the Monastery of St. George,
and a fragment of Nerinea, probably A^. (^randis, from the village Djanalai. The

Cephalopoda, of which the Ammonites belong mostly to the fimbriated group, have

been described by M. d'Orbigny, together with one species of Belemnites from Kobsel

and Biasali.

   In the list of Cretaceous fossils are included those mentioned by M. Du Bois de

Montpereux in his table of fossils from the Neocomian to the chalk found at Baktchi
Serai ; from the Neocomian of that locality he tabulates sixty-five species. The

Upper Cretaceous, including the Upper greensand. Chalk marl, and Upper chalk, are
richest in Conchifera, of which there are thirty-two species. Many of these were col-

lected by Capt. Cockburn from the Upper chalk of Inkermann, several of them being
identical with characteristic chalk fossils. Associated with these were found many
specimens of a large Crania, identified with the Crania spi7iulosa of l>ii\ssor\, Hni most

probably the same species as that mentioned by Du Bois in his table imder the name

of Crania mimmidits from Baktchi Serai.

   From the Nummulitic formation, belonging to the Older Tertiary, only twenty-
three species are known, most of these being included by M. Du Bois in his table of
cretaceous fossils. The Nummulites are refei-red by M. d'Orbigny to two species

only, viz. NummuUles nnmnmlaria and N. mamilla from near Simferopol. Three
species of Echinoderms from this formation are mentioned in M. d'Orbigny's ' Pro-

drome de Paleontologie,' a remarkable form of wliich, the Conoclypus conoideus, is in

this collection, from near Simferopol; it has also been described as from near the
River Salghir. Of Conchifera eight species are tabulated, the most characteristic of

which is the Ostrea gigantica (Brander). Ten species of Gasteropoda are also noticed,

one of them being the Cerithium giyanteum, a large cast of whicli, together with the

last-named oyster from Simferopol, is also in this collection.

The list of Newer Tertiary, or Steppe limestone fossils, includes those described by
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  63

M. Deshayes in the third volume of the ' Memoirs Geol. Soc. of France,' from Ter-
tiary deposits in the neighbourhood of Kertcli ; the majority of them are, however,
from near Sevastopol. The classes represented, with the exception of two new species
of Amorphozoa, are entirely composed of species of Conchifera and Gasteropoda, in
nearly equal proportions, more than half of which are new. Of the peculiar forms of
Cardhim resembling the present Aralo-Caspian types, thirty-one species are tabulated,
including those described by M. Deshayes, as found associated with bands of iron-ore
before alluded to. Several of these are in the collection of the British Museum from
the same locality ; also twelve species of Trochus, some of them being in beautiful
preservation, and mostly collected by Capt. Cockburn from the Quarantine Harbour,
Sevastopol. Six of these are identified with species iigured in the fine work of M.
Hommaire, and described by M. d'Orbigny from the Tertiary of Kichinev in Bessa-
rabia, and contemporaneous deposits.

            On the Origin of Siliceous Deposits in the Chalk Formation.
                       By J. S. BowERBANK, F.R.S., F.G.S. 8fC.

   Some years since the author read at the Geological Society of London, a paper on
the origin and structure of the siliceous deposits of the chalk and greensand forma-
tions, and subsequently one on the spongeous origin of moss, agates, &c., in which he

advocated the doctrine of the derivation of nearly the whole of the flints and cherts
from various species of sponges that existed in the ancient oceans.

   The principal proofs adduced at that time in favour of the views then enunciated,
were to a great extent derived from the microscopical evidence afforded by sections
of such siliceous bodies. . The object of the present communication is to strengthen
and confirm those views by the production of evidence derived from information
recently acquired, regarding the habits and manner of growth of the recent Spon-
giadae. In the opinion of the author, the whole of the numerous strata of nodular and
tabular flints are derived from vast quantities of sponges that existed in the seas of those

periods ; the attraction of the animal matter of the sponges inducing the deposit of
the silex, which in the first instance is always in the form of a thin film surrounding
the skeleton of the sponge, and from which successive crops of chalcedonic crystals
proceed until the solidification of the whole is effected.

   The tabular beds of flint are accounted for on the presumption that the sponges
originating the deposit grew on a more consolidated bottom than the tuberous ones,
and that they therefore developed themselves laterally instead of perpendicularly, as
many species of recent sponges are in the habit of doing, and that approaching and
touching each other, they united and thus formed extensive and continuous beds
instead of numerous isolated specimens. The author illustrated this part of his
subject by producing four recent sponges of the same species, which having been
placed in close contact while in the living state, became firmly united to each other
within eighteen hours, and ultimately formed but one sponge.

   ThФ occurrence of the shells of bivalves and of echinoderms filled with flint or chert,
was accounted for on the principle of their having been previously filled with living
sponges, and subsequently fossilized by the deposit in the spongeous tissue of silex
held in solution in the water ; in illustration of which the author produced specimens
of recent bivalve shells in a closed condition, which were completely filled with recent

sponges.

   The loose specimens of fossil sponges contained in the Wiltshire flints were ex-
plained on the same principle ; but their not adhering to each other, the author stated,
was in accordance with the law that always obtains among the recent Spongiadse,
that although individuals of the same species of sponge always adhere on being
brought in close contact, those of different species never unite under such circum-
stances, and specimens of recent sponges, one species completely enveloping the other,
but without the slightest adherence between them, were exhibited.

   The author concluded his paper by applying the same principles to the siliceous
deposits of the whole of the geological formations of aqueous origin, and by expressing
his opinion that the geological office of the Spongiada; in creation is that of inducing

the deposit of siliceous matter held in solution in the ocean, as the Corallidse assist in
the consolidation of the calcareous matter.

On some New Species of Corals in the Lias of Gloucestershire, Worcestershire,
         and Warwickshire. By the Rev. P. B. Bhodie, M.A., F.G.S.

   The object of this communication is rather to indicate the occurrence of some new
and undescribed species of corals in the Lias, than to describe them in detail. They
are generally rare in the Lias, the sea in which it was deposited being unfavourable

to the growth of Polyparia. A species of Ci/athophylhan and a Flustra have been

found by Mr. C. Moore in the Upper Lias of Ilminster, in Somersetshire, in addi-
tion to those figured in the ' JNIemoirs of the Pakeontographical Society.' From
the Lias marlstone of Northamptonshire a form belonging probably to the Fungidae

is in the collection of the late Hugh Strickland, Esq. I have in my collection several

specimens of the genus Moidlivallia, which I discovered in the shales of the Lower
Lias, in Gloucestersliire, and one or two occur in the same beds in Oxfordshire. From
the Lower Lias near Cheltenham, I obtained a small coral, which appears to be a
species of Turb'moUa. I have met with a few species of hastrea both in Worcester-
shire and Gloucestershire, and in one case in sufficient numbers to show the existence
of an ancient coral reef: most of them arc highly solidified, but in others the cells
are soft and crumbly, a condition very different to that of most of the Imiixclsastrea.
In the Isle of Skye there is a group of corals belonging to this genus nearly a foot in

thickness in the lower division of the Lias.

On a New Species of Pollicipes in the Inferior Oolite near Stroud, in Glouces-
                 tershire. By the Rev. P. B. Bkodie, M.A., F.G.S.

The Lepadidre are usually rare in a fossil state, and the specimen which I found

at Selsley Hill, near Stroud, appears to be a distinct species from the Pollicipes ooli-

ticus in the Stonesfield slate. On comparing the scutum two valves of which are

entire, with the same valve of P. ooliticus, there is a sufficient difference to warrant

Athe conclusion that it belongs to a different species.  small valve of another, and

probably a distinct species, has been detected in the Lias at Campden, in Gloucester-

shire, by Mr. Gavey, the oldest remains of a Cirripede yet discovered.

       On the Basement Beds of the Oolite.
By Professor James Buckman, F.L.S., F.G.S.

   The object of this paper was to show that the Pisolite or its equivalents formed
the true base of the Inferior Oolite as established by Murchison, Strickland, and the
Cotteswold geologists, but in opposition to a theory recently started by Dr. Wright,
in which he places certain bands of ferruginous stone resting on the " Inferior Oolite
sands " of the Ordnance Surveyors with the Upper Lias, a theory which he attempts
to support from the presence of a number of Cephalopoda therein contained, some of
which are truly liassic, but the majority are peculiar to the so-called ' Cephalopoda

bed.'

   The Professor contends that the bed is oolitic in structure, and as regards the fossils,
only a small per-centage belong to the Lias, as may be seen from the following

Thus giving a total of forty-three species, only eleven of which are liassic, and of

these several extend a considerable way upwards in the oolitic series.

The author further contended, that as much as from sixty to eighty feet below the

'Cephalopoda bed,' at the very base of the " Inferior Oolite sands/' a band of ferru-

ginous oolite had been worked by Mr. John Lycett, of Minchinhampton, which was

full of fossils of the Inferior Oolite forms,-- a fact not adverted to by the learned Doc-

tor, as he was then unaware of the bed. This may be summed up as follows :

    Here, then, if fossil evidence is to be relied on, the sands far below the Inferior Oolite

should be added to that rock rather than a portion of the Inferior Oolite to be abs-
tracted and added to the Lias, an argument which was further supported by reference
to the fauna of the Cornbrash, in which out of about sixty-five species, twenty-one,

including even Cephalopoda, were identical with the common species of the Inferior

Oolite.

   The author's general conclusion was, that as the Inferior Oolite sands mark a change
in the physical conditions under which the unctuous blue lias clays were deposited,
which was immediately followed by a corresponding change of animal life, therefore
the natural separation of the Lias and Oolite should commence with these sands : by
so doing we have a boundary-line which all can recognize both lithologically and
palseontologically ; whereas by adopting Dr. Wright's view, we separate a bed of true
oolitic structure into two parts in obedience to the dictum of a small minority of fossils
peculiar to lower strata which one must always meet with at points of oscillation.

   Hitherto the only fossils which have been obtained from the oldest fossiliferous
strata of Ireland, the Cambrian rocks of the county of Wicklow, consist of two forms
of Oldhamia, viz. 0. radiata from the purple slates of Brayhead, and 0. antiqua
from the drab shales of Carrick M'Rielly. Associated with the former, last summer,
the author found evidences of the existence of Annelidse in the form of burrows, and
also sinuous ti-acks on the surfaces of some of the purple slates. These tracks and
burrows appear to be among the earliest we possess, which show the occurrence of
this tribe of animals.

   Among the black graptolitic shales of Moffatdale, at Dobbs Lin, the author has

also met with specimens of Beyrichia complicata, a crustacean which occurs in the
Lower Silurian rocks of England and the continent of Europe.

       On the Jointing of Rocks. By Professor Harkness, F.G.S.

   In the Devonian strata of the south of Ireland the rocksmanifest jointing in a very
perfect state. The master-joints, which are very prominent, have a north and south

direction, and, in the language of Professor Sedgwick, might be termed lip-joints

joints of a similar nature are also seen intersecting the carboniferous limestone, where
they are even more prominent than in the Devonians, having frequently the aspect

of stratification, and being, like the Devonian joints, pei-pendicular. Besides these

perpendicular master-joints, the carboniferous limestone is also intersected by two

other series of jointings, the one nearly horizontal, and the other inclined at about

46░, also running north and south. These two latter jointings are not so persistent

as the master-joints, and are, in some cases, only local.
   The great uniformity of the master-joints and their great parallelism over larga

areas, would induce the conclusion that they result from some uniform cause operating
over a great space.

   The theory which attributes joints to shrinkage would not be sufficient to account

for these master-joints.

   These seem rather to have originated from the application of a mechanical force
applied in one direction. This force was probably that which gave the middle and

--upper palaeozoic strata of the south of Ireland their east and west strike of rolls, the

force being apphed either to the north or south, the rocks having a tendency to extend
themselves at right angles to the direction of the force, and consequently breaking,
from their rigidity, into parallel lines which we recognize as joints. The origin of

the other two forms of jointing is by no means apparent, but this may probably have
been the same cause operating locally in different directions at a subsequent period to

that which produced the master-joints.

           On the Lignites of the Giant's Causeway and the Isle of Mull.
                            By Professor Harkness, F.G.S.

   The Giant's Causeway affords, in connexion with its basalts, beds of lignite, and in
the Isle of Mull we have the same circumstances occurring. The lignite of the former
locality retains its woody nature to a great extent, and this exhibits sufficient of its
original structure to admit of the determination of the forms of vegetables to which
this substance owes its origin. The only changes which the structure of this substance
has undergone, result from compression, which has brought the sides of the woody
cells in immediate contact, and in some instances so lacerated the tissue as to give
this, in longitudinal section, a somewhat spiral arrangement. Sometimes, however,
the longitudinal section gives this tissue in its perfect state, and when this is the case,
pitted vessels, of a coniferous character, are seen on the sides of the cells.

   The size of these cells, and their relative distance from each other, would lead to the
conclusion that the trees forming this lignite are nearly allied to those which are found
forming the mass of lignite mentioned by His Grace the Duke of Argyll as occurring

associated with the basalts of the Island of Mull. In the latter locality the lignite
presents itself in two conditions, the one in a state of nearly pure coal, the other

having more of a woody aspect.
   The vegetable fibre of the Mull lignites is often sufficiently distinct to manifest its

internal structure, and would support the inference as to the similarity in age of these
deposits, and those of the Giant's Causeway. The fossil evidence, as this is shown
by the nature of the lignites, supports the conclusion of His Grace the Duke of
Argyll, adopted by Sir Charles Lyell, that the traps of Mull and the Giant's Cause-
way belong to the same geological epoch, that epoch being the Miocene.

On the Relative Distribution of Land and Water as affecting Climate at
   different Geological Epochs. By Professor Hennessy, M.R.I. A.

   The views developed in this paper were partly deduced from the principles advanced
by the author in his memoir on isothermal lines. As all the investigations on terres-
trial temperatures which he has undertaken will be printed elsewhere, it is unnecessary
to do more than state some of the conclusions of this paper.

   1. The distribution of land and water most favourable to high general terrestrial

temperature all over the globe is that of the existence of land, not in great continents,

but in islands evenly distributed over the earth's surface.
   2. Under such conditions the isothermal lines in the islands would generally

approach the character of closed curves, and the temperature in the higher latitudes

would decrease in advancing from the coasts to the interior of an island.
   3. If these views are correct, some differences might be expected between some of

the fossils representing the organized beings of the interior of such islands, and those

distributed about the coasts.  ^

On the South'Sastefly Attenuation of the Oolitic, Liassic, Triassic, and
        Permian Formations. By Edward Hull, A.B., F.G.S.

The subject of this paper is partly of a local, and partly of a general character.
Sir R. I. Murchison having called the attention of the Section to the Map of the

Geological Survey (No. 44) just completed, and embracing the region of the Cottes-
wold Hills, together with the liassic plains of Gloucester and Moreton, the author

proceeded to point out the remarkable diminution in thickness which the rocks of the

Cotteswold Hills undergo in their extension to the borders of Oxfordshire.

Taking as points of comparison Leckhampton Hill near Cheltenham, and Burford

in Oxfordshire, distant from each other about twenty miles, it was shown that the

same beds, which at the former locality have an aggregate thickness of 624 feet, at
the latter have dwindled down to the twenty-ninth part of this amount. The for-

mations included in this coiaiputation range from the marlstone to the Fuller's earth,

and may be tabulated as follows :

   From this table it would be observed that the ragstones of the inferior oolite, in-
cluding a bed remarkable for the abundance of Clypeus sinuatiis, forms the most con-
stant zone of the inferior oolite, and that at the eastern limits of the district it is the
sole representative of the formation. This fact tends to show that this terminating
zone was deposited in a sea of greater depth and tranquillity than that of the lower
members of the formation an hypothesis, which is also borne out by differences in the

                                                                                                                                         ;

state of the included organisms. For while i\\e freestones everywhere present the
phsenomena of false bedding, and are to a great extent composed of organic^ debris,
the stratification of the ragstones is always regular, and the organic remains in good

preservation, though frequently occurring as moulds and casts.
    Passing on to the consideration of the formations which underlie the marlstone or

middle lias, Mr. Hull proceeded to show from analogy the strong probability that the
lower lias forms no exception to the law of easterly attenuation, which obtains in the
case of the upper and middle members of the liassic group ; and that consequently
under Burford the lower lias would be found of comparatively small depth. From
these premises, he also drew the conclusion, that further in the same direction, e. g.
under the city of Oxford, all the strata already alluded to must be on the point of dis-

appearing.

    It was next shown that the trias of Central England undergoes a similar south-
easterly attenuation, so that, while in Lancashire, Cheshire, and Shropshire, the
Keuper and Bunter attain their greatest development, in the counties to the eastward
bordering on the lias, these formations are greatly reduced in thickness. With regard
to the Permian formation, it was not possible to speak with equal certainty, as it has
been found, through the researches of the Government Geological Surveyors, to vary
rapidly in thickness. Thus while it is almost or altogether absent around the Leices-
tershire coal-field, it appears in considerable force on the flanks of the coal-field of

Warwickshire.
    Attention was then called to the fact, that on the borders of France and Belgium,

and in the " Bas-Bouloimais," all the secondary formations between the coal-mea-
sures and the chalk in the former case, and the great oolite in the latter, are altogether
absent*. This fact was shown to bear out the hypothesis of the author, and to lead
to the supposition that under some parts of Oxfordshire and Northamptonshire the

coal-formation may lie at depths not inaccessible to human agency.

--68 REPORT 1856.

   Lastly, in order to obviate the objection that the coal-formation itself might have
thinned out in the same direction as the superincumbent formations, Mr. Hull endea-
voured to show that the manner of its formation, and that of the secondary strata,
were altogether different ; for while (as had been shown by Mr. Godwin-Austen) the
ancient coal basin included the greater part of the British Isles, France and Belgium
forming one almost uninterrupted coal-growth ; on the other hand, the development
of the new red sandstone and lias proved that they are formed of sediment derived
from norlh-westerlij sources, and that consequently, as the distance from these sources
increased, the quantity of sediment diminished. Hence it was argued, that while under
Oxfordshire the strata between the great oolite and the coal-measures might be very
thin, the thickness and quality of the coal-seams would not necessarily have deterio-

rated.

On the Alteration of Clay-slate and Gritstone into Mica-schist and Gneiss by
       the Granite of Wicklow, <^c. By J. Beete Jukes, M.A., F.R.S.

The granite of the south-east of Ireland, extending from Dublm Bay into the county

of Kilkenny, is intrusive as regards the Lower Silurian rocks, and sends veins into them.

The Lower Silurian rocks generally are composed of dull earthy slates interstratified

with fine-grained gritstones commonly not more Uian an inch in thickness, but some-

times two or three feet. The main granite range is not a true geological axis, as it

does not bring up the lowest beds of the district, and forms only a partial geographical

axis as it is breached through by the valley of the Slaney.

Wherever granite appears at the surface, it metamorphoses the surrounding slaty

rocks and changes   them    into schistose rocks (mica-schist, &c., and gneiss).  "  glaze  "
   The dull earthy          are found on approaching the granite to acquire a
                    slates

or silvery lustre not only externally but internally, as it is as apparent in the rock when

ground to powder or triturated into mud or silt as in the mass of the rock. This

micaceous lustre increases as we approach the granite, till within half a mile (more or

less) of its general boundary nothing can be found but schistose rocks, often containing

crystals of garnet, andalusite, staurolite, schorl, &c. Simultaneously with this change

in mineral structure the rocks are affected by a folding or corrugation, crumpling both
slates and grits, evidently the result of a mechanical force. The foliation of the mica-

schist is most usually parallel to the original stratification of the rock, as shown by

these grit-bands.

   In the cases observed where the foliation crossed the beds, and ran parallel to the
cleavage, the plates of mica were smaller and more interrupted than when parallel to

the bedding, their development being apparently interfered with by the changes of

texture in the original lamination of stratification.

   The surface boundary of the granite is very undulating and irregular, and many

large patches of schistose rock are found within it, resting on, and apparently dipping
down into the granite. The original surface of the granite appears to have had rather a
gentle general slope, but to have been very uneven, having many hollows and

protuberances,

^v Although the lowest beds of the Silurian rocks are not brought up by the granite,
yet the beds near it dip every way from it at angles not often exceeding 30░, and the
patches of schistose rock lying within the general boundary of the granite dip towards

that boundary. The graphite is probably continued under the adjacent slates with a
similarly gentle slope and irregular surface ; especially on the eastern side, where many

smaller bosses appear at the surface between the main range and the sea. These

smaller bosses produce alteration in the slates through which they appear, exactly

similar to that of the main range, though of proportionately less extent.

   At Polmounty near New Ross, thick beds of grit interstratified with shale were

observed converted into alternations of fine-grained gneiss and mica-schist, and near
Graiguenamanagh a dark gneiss was seen, in which crystals of common felspar as large
as the thumb were imbedded, forming a true porphyritic gneiss, which is yet nothing
more than an altered Silurian gritstone or an arenaceous slate rock.

   The very general occurrence of mica in these schistose rocks results probably from
the varied mineral composition of different well-characterized micas, so that true mica
(of some kind or other) is more likely to be produced than any other mineral. Inde-
                                                               TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                       69

pendently of this, however, it was asked if mica, such as it occurs in mica-schist, might
not often rather be the result of the physical condition of other mineral combinations,
than those forming well-characterized micas ; whether those combinations were definite'

minerals, or only indefinite mixtures of silicates of alumina with other silicates?

    Finally, it was stated as the general result, that no one could examine the district
without arriving at the conclusion, that as perfect mica-schist, gneiss, &c. as can be
found in any so-called primitive district, has been produced by the metamorphosis of
earthy clay-slate by the granite, and without being convinced that all schistose rocks,
even the most crystalline gneiss, had a similar metamorphic origin.

Glamorganshire. It runs into the land to the depth of 206 yards, 56 of which are
covered by shingle. The width at the mouth is 80 yards ; and in the broadest part
a little below the bottom of the shingle, ] 03. Hard firm sand of an average width of
20 yards occurs from low water to the shingle ; on each side of which are large and
rugged rocks filling up the rest of the inlet. It would not appear therefore that the

action of the sea can be peculiarly violent here, more especially when we consider

that the general bearing of the little fiord is N. 10░ E. and S. 10░ W., the prevaihno-

being thrown into the little bay already described, somewhat below high-water mark.

    The general result to be deduced from the above may be thus stated ;--that on a
beach not more than usually exposed to the action of the sea, ten years sufficed for

the formation of "rolled stones."

                 On the Skin and Food of Ichthyosauri and Teleosauri.
                               By Charles Moore, F.G.S.

  mIn clearing specimens of the former genus dark patches of matter have been

frequently seen, association with which thousands of minute black hooks may be

noticed by the aid of the lens. These have been supposed to be portions of the outer
       of the Ichthyosaurus covered by the hook-shaped processes referred to. It was

stated by Mr. Moore that out of twenty-three saurians in his museum he had traced

these black patches in not less than sixteen; but that as in every instance they were
^ --REPORT 1856.

connected with the stomach of the saurian, the conclusion was forced upon him that
they were not portions of skin, but were to be accounted for by supposing that the
Ichthyosauri had fed upon naked cephalopods, alUed to the cuttle-fish. On continuing
his investigations on the subject, Mr. Moore proved that there were many cephalopods
existing with the Ichthyosaurus that would supply these hooks, and that they were fre-
quently to be found on the fleshy arms of the Omjclioteuthis and allied genera.
Mr. Moore exhibited to the Meeting the body of a small saurian, which at this distant
time had its soft skin entire ; and appealed to it in confirmation of his opinion, that
the black patches containing these hooks were no portion of its outer covering. In
conclusion, Mr. Moore produced some of the dark matter taken from the stomach of
one of his Ichthyosauri, and stated that he could show to the Meeting, that although
it had through so many ages been lying in the stomach of this ancient creature, and
had been mixed with other food, it could be no other than what was once the fluid
ink of a cuttle-fish ; a fact, which was demonstrated to the Meeting, by his showing
them that it retained its colouring matter almost as perfectly as if it had been taken
from a recent sepia. Of the genus Teleosaurus a very beautiful example was shown
to the Meeting, which, like the Gavise of the present day, was covered with bony
scutes or scales. In clearing this specimen, Mr. Moore was fortunate enough to
make an incision into its stomach, in which, though so long a period had elapsed since
it had taken its last meal, there was still to be seen there, in perfect preservation, a
small fish of the genus Leptolepis.

                On the Middle and Upper Lias of the West of England.
                                 By Charles Moore, F.G.S.

    Sections were given of these beds at Ilminster, their most westerly point, from
whence they were traced to Yeovil, where they were shown to become extremely thin,
and to be covered up by the sands of the Inferior Oolite, from whence they were traced
to Bath and to the neighbourhood of Cheltenham, where they were shown to be of
considerable thickness. In noticing the organic remains of the Middle Lias, Mr.
Moore called attention to the Brachiopoda in these beds, and exhibited many of the
original specimens of this class published by the Palaeontographical Society. The
attention of the meeting was also directed to a series of microscopic shells of the family
Foraminifera, nearly 150 species of which were shown by Mr. Moore to have existed
during the deposition of the Middle and Upper Lias. From the latter beds a magni-
ficent series of organic remains was exhibited, chiefly consisting of Saurians, Fishes,
Crustacea, and Insects. Mr. Moore amused the Section by informing them what
animals were contained in certain stones, which, on being broken, presented the animals

indicated.

On the Bone Beds of the Upper Ludlow Rock, and base of the Old Red Sand-
                        stone. By Sir R. I. Murchison, FM.S.

    Sir Roderick Murchison gave an account of certain additional discoveries made
in those strata, which, whether they pertain to the uppermost beds of the Silurian
rocks, or to the lowest junction strata of the Old Red Sandstone, have been grouped
under the term of "Tilestones." In his original description of the upper Ludlow
rocks he had described a layer, near their summit, as being characterized by the
remains of bones of fishes, principally the defences of Onchus, with jaws and teeth,
and numerous small coprolitic bodies. He also formerly noticed, in several locali-
ties, the occurrence of a still higher bed, which seemed to form a passage into the
Old Red Sandstone, and in which remains of terrestrial plants occurred. He had
further pointed out, that the Upper Ludlow Rock was the lowest stratum in which

--the remains of Vertebrata were discovered, an observation which has remained
--uncontroverted till the present day, no remains of true fishes having yet been detected

in more ancient strata in any part of Europe. In an ascending order, on the other
hand, it was well known that Ichthyolites augmented rapidly; and the object of the
present communication is to show how the recent Ouservations of Mr. Richard Banks,
of Kington, and of Mr. Lightbody, of Ludlow, have made us acquainted with the
presence of fish remains in thin layers a few feet above the original bone-bed of the

Upper Ludlow Rock.
         TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.             ^l

The lower of these overlying beds, which, according to sections exhibited, occurs both

at Kington and Ludlow, was recently inspected by Sir Roderick, accompanied by

Professor Ramsay, Mr. Aveline, and Mr. Salter. It is a greyish or yellowish flag-like

sandstone, the lowest course of which, at Kington, contains many spines of Onchus,

with Lingula cornea. This thin layer, and another softer one, full of remains of

Pterygotus, and with two species of Pteraspis, are there surmounted by bluish-grey

building-stone, with Pterygotus, Lingula cornea, &c. These beds are covered by

others, less massive, which contain fragments of plants and large Pterygoti, and gra-

duate upwards insensibly into more micaceous sandstones, often splitting into tiles.

The Lingula cornea and Trochus helicites, together with species of Alodiolopsis, and

hitherto the small Beyrichia Klodeni, all considered characteristic of the uppermost

Ludlow rock, prevail throughout these strata, with occasional carbonaceous matter

and traces of land vegetation ; clearly indicating a graduation towards the younger

formation of Old Red Sandstone. The last-mentioned fish-bed is probably of similar

age to the stratum which Sir R. \. Murchison described as occupying the summit of the

ASilurian system in Clun Forest and other places.  stratum of this age has recently

been laid open by the cutting of the railroad north-east of the town of Ludlow, and

exhibits a grey rock beneath passing up into an overlying micaceous reddish sand-

stone and red marl : large fragments oi Pterygotus are here associated with remains

of fishes and the Lingula cornea.

The succession is more clearly traceable on the i"ight bank of the Teme, opposite

Ludlow and below Ludford, where the Ludlow rocks with the old bone-bed are over-

laid by micaceous brownish-red sandstones and red marls, with true cornstones, ex-

posed in the bed of the river, which are again followed by other marls and sandstones,

surmounted by a band of coarse, greenish-grey micaceous sandstone, containing re-

mains both of fishes and of Pterygotus. The fish remains consist of distinct jaws and

teeth and fin defences of OwcAms, the heads of a Cephalaspis, together with Xhe Lingula

cornea.

The genus Pterygotus having now been found throughout the Upper Silurian rocks,

can no longer be considered characteristic of the transition beds' between the Silurian

and Devonian ; and as the genera Cephalaspis and Pteraspis are now known to extend

their downward range to the very verge of the true upper Ludlow strata, our views

concerning the zoological characters, which separate the two formations, may be

settled accordingly. As regards the frontier of the Silurian rocks in England, the

phaenomena present no ambiguity ; for all the strata, from the lowest bone-bed of the
true Ludlow rock, which contains so many species of shells of Silurian age, to the

--uppermost of the above-mentioned fish-beds with the Lingula cornea, do not exceed

40 or 50 feet in thickness, the upper part of the series with the Cephalaspis and

Pteraspis, constituting a true mineral and zoological passage into the Old Red Sand-

stone. In conclusion, the author observed, that if applied either to the top of the Upper
Ludlow Rock or to the base of the Old Red Sandstone exclusively, the word "tilestones"

might mislead ; but if generally to the beds of transition between the two deposits,

it is still a convenient term.

 Description of an ancient Miner's Axe recently discovered in the Forest ofDean.
         In a letter to Richard Beamish, F.R.S. By Robkbt Mushet.

    The accompanying relic was found as follows. Some miners were engaged at an
 iron-mine, near Lambsquay, in turning over some of the refuse iron-ore, which had
 been put aside centuries ago as not rich enough in iron to be suited for the Bloomary
' Forges then in use. At a depth of upwards of sixteen feet, and under a very old and
 decayed lime tree, which had grown over the spot, the axe was discovered amongst
 the refuse iron-ore. The handle was broken to pieces and lost, before the axe itself
 was noticed, a circumstance much to be regretted. The spot where the axe was dis-
 covered, was free from moisture, except that incidental to rainy weather, and there-
 fore the axe itself must have been wet and dry just as the weather varied. On trying
 the point of the axe with a file, it proved to be iron, and not steel, so that its date
 must have been earlier than that of the use of steel for mining purposes.

    The iron-ore surrounding the axe, was a mixture of hydrated peroxide of iron and
 carbonate of lime, mixed with common loam, and the axe itself is covered with Qpn-
.

--72 REPORT 1856.

cretionary carbonate of lime and hydrated peroxide of iron. But the extraordinary
circumstance connected with this discovery is the fact, that the wooden handle origi-
nally inserted into the eye of the axe, has become converted into pure hydrated per-
oxide of iron, precisely similar to the ordinary brush iron-ore peculiar to the Forest
of Dean, except that in the centre of the handle, on the underside of the eye, a portion
of soft woody fibre remains, and on the upper side there appear the two small iron
wedges by which the helve was tightened to the axe. Thus apiece of wood (probably
ash) has been replaced by hydrous oxide of iron, composed of

   Peroxide of iron  81'63
   Water             18-37

Or more probably it is the subhydrate, containing only 10-5 per cent, of water, and
which is the proportion contained in the forest brush-ore. Two reedy specimens,
taken from the solid vein of iron-ore, near the spot where the axe was found, accom-
pany the latter, and in their appearance they present some analogy to the converted

portion of the axe-handle.
    I believe that this relic of antiquity is well worthy of the notice of the British

Association about to meet in Cheltenham, and I have therefore enclosed it, and the
reedy specimens, in a box, to be forwarded to you.

On the Dichodon cuspidatus, /rom the Upper Eocene of the Isle of Wight and
                    Hordwell, Hants. By Professor Owen, F.R.S.

   Prof. Owen communicated the results of examinations of additional specimens of

jaws and teeth of the Dichodon cuspidatus, which he had received since his original
Memoirs on that extinct animal in the 'Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society,'
vol. iv. (June 1847). The first specimen described supplied the characters of the
last true molar tooth of the lower jaw, which had not been previously known. This
tooth has six lobes, the additional posterior pair being less than the normal ones, and
more simple. The inner surface of the inner lobe has an accessory cusp at the back
part of its base, but not at the fore-part as in the other lobes. The length of the last
lower molar was nine lines, that of the first and second molars being each six lines.

A specimen of the Dichodon cuspidatus from the Hordwell Sands, in the British

Museum, supplied the characters of the permanent incisors, canine, and three anterior
premolars of the upper jaw : all these teeth closely correspond in form with the cor-
responding deciduous teeth, but are of larger size. Finally, a portion of the lower jaw
of an aged specimen of Dichodon, in the British Museum, showing the effects of
attrition on the last molar tooth, was described, and the results of this additional evi-

dence confirmed the conclusions of the author as to the generic distinction of the

Dichodon.

  Additional Evidence of the Fossil Musk-Ox (Bubalus moschatus) yrow the
                      Wiltshire Drift. By Professor Owen, F.R.S.

    This evidence consisted of mutilated crania, but with the horn-cores complete, of
both male and female Musk-Ox.

   Drawings of the specimens of the natural size of the fossils were exhibited, and the
characters were pointed out which, in the author's opinion, confirmed his opinion of
the fossil being of the same species as the recent Musk-Ox of Arctic America (Buba-
lus moschatus)

   The fossils were associated with remains of the Elephas primigenius, Bhinoceros
tichorinus, and teeth of bovine, cervine, and equine quadrupeds. They were discovered
by Charles Moore Esq., F.G.S., of Bath.

On a New Species of Anoplotherioid Mammal (Dichobune Ovinum, Ow.) from

Cuvier, from the Upper Eocene marl at Binstead, Isle of Wight, Hampshire ; and

pointed out the characters by which it differed from the known nearest allied fossils.

The total length of the lower jaw was 5 inches 11 lines the extent of the molar series
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

of teeth 2 inches 11 lines, and that of the three true molars 1 inch Sj lines.

The near equality in height of the crowns of all the teeth, and their general cha-

racter, show that the animal belonged to that group of the Anoplotherioid family which

includes the genera Dichohune and Xiphodon.

It has the same dental formula as the Anoplotherioid and Anthracotherioid qua-

drupeds, viz.

                           ,-3-3     1-1 4-4                                                           3-3  ..

   It differs from the genus Dichodon in the absence of the accessory cusps on the
inner side of the base of the true molars, and both from Dichodon cuspidatus and
Xiphodon gracilis, in the minor antero-posterior extent of the premolar teeth : it cori-e-
sponds with the Dichohme leporinum, Cuv., in the proportions of the premolars and in
the separation of the canine and anterior premolar; and to this genus, therefore, the new
fossil was referred. Its size and proportions indicate its specific distinction from
previously defined species of Dichohune. The name proposed for this species is
Dichobune ovinum. The specimen forms part of the series of fossils in the British
Museum.

On a Fossil Mammal (Stereognathus Ooliticus) from the Stonesfield Slate.
                              By Professor Owen, F.R.S.

Prof. Owen exhibited, by favour of the Rev. J. P. B. Dennis, M. A., a portion of a

lower jaw, with three molar teeth, of a small mammal, from the oolitic slate of

Stonesfield, Oxfordshire, for which the name of Stereognathus Ooliticus had been

proposed ; and after a minute description of the characters of the bone and teeth, he

entered upon the question of its probable affinities. These could only be judged

of by the peculiarities of certain molar teeth of the lower jaw of the unique fossil.

Those teeth presented the singular complexity of six cusps or cones upon the grind-

ing surface, in three longitudinal pairs, the crown of the tooth being quadrate, broad-

est transversely, but very short or low. The jaw-bone presents a corresponding shal-

lowness and thickness. The cusps are sub-compressed : the outermost and innermost

of the three hinder ones are oblique, and converge towards the middle of the crown,

being overlapped by the outermost and innermost of the three front cones. The

three molar teeth occupy the extent of 4^ lines, or 1 centimetre ; each tooth being 3

millimetres in fore and aft extent, and nearly four millimetres in transverse extent.

After a comparison of these molars with the multicuspid teeth of the Rat, the Hedge-

hog, the Shrews and Galeopitheci, the author showed that the proportions, numbers,

and arrangement of the cusps in those Insectivora forbad a reference of the Stereo-

gnathus, on dental grounds, to that order. The same negative result followed a com-
parison of the fossil oolitic mammal with the sex-cuspid teeth with the eocene

Hyracothere,   Microthere  and     Hyopotamus                                                     but  in   these  the  resemblance  was
                                                                                               ;

presented only by the teeth of the upper jaw. The lower molar teeth of the Choero-

potamus, to which the author deemed those of the Hyracotherium would most closely

approximate, when discovered, showed a rudiment of the intermediate cones between

the normal pairs of cones. The proportional size and regularity of the form of the

cones of the grinding teeth of the Stereognathus give a quite different character of

the crown from that of the multicuspid molars of the Insectivora, and cause the sex-

cuspid crown of the oolitic mammal to resemble the pente-cuspid and quadri-cuspid

molars of the before-cited extinct Artiodactyle genera. Prof. Owen concluded, there-

fore, that the Stereognathus was most probably a diminutive form of non-ruminant

Artiodactyle, of omnivorous habits.

   On the Scelidotherium leptocephalum, a Megatherioid Quadrupedfrom
                        La Plata. By Professor Owen, F.R.S.

   The extinct species of large terrestrial sloth indicated by the above name, was first
made known by portions of its fossil skeleton having been discovered by Charles
--74 REPORT 1856.

Darwin, Esq., F.R.S., at Punta Alta, Northern Patagonia, These portions were
described by the author in the appendix to the ' Natural History of the Voyage of

H.M.S. Beagle.' The subsequent acquisition by the British Museum of the collec-
tion of Fossil Mammalia brought from Buenos Ayres by M. Bravard, has given further

evidenceof the generic distinction ofScelidotherhtm, aud has supplied important charac-
ters of the osseous system, and especially of the skull, which the fragments from the
hard consolidated gravel of Punta Alta did not afford. The best portion of the cra-
nium from that locality wanted the facial part anterior to the orbit, and the greater
part of the upper walls ; sufficient, however, remained to indicate the peculiar charac-

ter of its slender proportions, and hence Professor Owen has been led to select the
name leptocephalum for the species, which is undoubtedly new. The aptness of the

epithet ' slender headed,' is proved by the author's researches to be greater than could
have been surmised from the original fossil ; for the entire skull, now in the British
Museum, exhibits a remarkable prolongation of the upper and lower jaws, and a
slenderness of the parts pi-oduced anterior to the dental series, unique in the leaf-eat-
ing section of the order Bruia, and offering a very interesting approximation to the
peculiar proportions of the skull in the Ant-eaters. The original fossils from Pata-
gonia indicated that they belonged to an individual of immature age : the difference of
size between them and the corresponding parts in the British Museum, depends on
the latter having belonged to full-grown individuals : the slight difference in the shape
of the anterior molars seems in like manner to be due to such an amount of change
as might take place in the progress of growth of a tooth with a constantly renewable

pulp. Professor Owen finds at least no good gi-ounds for inferring a specific distinc-

tion between the fossils of the old animal from Buenos Ayres, and the younger
specimen from Patagonia. The author then proceeds to give a detailed anatomical
account of the fossil bones in the British Museum, instituting a comparison betweeu
them and the bones of other large extinct animals, especially those of the Edentate
order. The Scelidothere was a quadruped of from eight to ten feet in length, but not
more than four feet high, and nearly as broad at the haunches, the thigh-bones being
extraordinarily broad in proportion to their length. The trunk gradually tapered
forwards to the long and slender head. The fore-limbs had complete clavicles, and
the rotatory movements of the fore-arm. All the limbs were provided with long and
strong claws. The animal had a long and muscular tongue, and it is probable that
its food might have been of a more mixed nature than that of the Megatherium.
But it was more essentially related to the Sloths than to the Ant-eaters. In conclusion,
the author remarks, that as our knowledge of the great Megatherioid animals increases,
the definition of their distinctive characters demands more extended comparison of
particulars. Hence in each successive attempt at a restoration of these truly remark-
able extinct South American quadrupeds, there results a discription of details which
might seem prolix and uncalled for, but which are necessary for the proper develop-
ment of the task of reproducing a specimen of an extinct species.

    These details of the osteology and dentition of the Scelidotherium leptocephalum, it
is the intention of the author to communicate, with the requisite illustrations, to the
Royal Society of London.

              On the Beekites found in the Red Conglomerates of Torbay.

                             By W. Pengellt, F.G.S.

    Perhaps the most interesting things found in the red Triassic conglomerates of
Torbay are the Beekites, so named from the late Dr. Beeke, Dean of Bristol, by
whom, it is believed, they were first noticed. They vary in size from half an inch
to a foot, but the more common dimensions are from three to six inches in mean
diameter. Their surfaces are covered with chalcedony, generally arranged in tuber-
cles, each of which is not unfrequently surrounded by one or more rings, and occa-
sionally the same ring invests two or more tubercles, or sets of rings.

   The interior of the Beekite is calcareous. In most instances the nucleus is under-
going decomposition and is only partially attached to the shell ; sometimes it is entirely
detached, and rolls about within the cavity when shaken ; not unfreijuently it is
reduced to a dark-brown or iron-grey powder, which effervesces in acids.

   The nucleus appears to be always a fossil, aud is either a sponge, a coral, a shell.

-- --or a group of shells generally spiral univalves all of well-known Devonian forms.

The organic structure is frequently preserved on the inner or concave surface of the
enveloping ei-ust, even when the nucleus is reduced to powder. Occasionally organic

traces are discernible on the exterior surface of the chalcedony, but such cases are

not frequent. Some of the nuclei are slightly siliceous, but in no. case more so than

ordinary limestones are.
    Beekites which have fallen from the cliff, and have been for some time exposed to

the action of the waves, are much abraded, while those taken at once from the rock
above the reach of the sea have not the least marks of friction ; hence it may be
inferred that the chalcedony has been deposited on the nuclei since they became

immoveable, that is since the conversion of the ancient triassic sea-beach into a
conglomerate rock.

    Beekites are found in every part of the Torbay conglomerates, which extend along
the coast from two and a half to three miles, but they are considerably more abun-
dant at Livermead Head, and at and near Paignton harbour, than elsewhere in the
district ; but though rocks of the same age and character prevail throughout a great
part of the south-east of Devonshire, no Beekites have been found beyond the district
named ; indeed, so far as is at present known, they appear to be peculiar to Torbay.

   On whatever surface chalcedony is deposited, it appears in most cases to take a
tubercular arrangement ; hence the tubercles on the surface of the Beekite. From a

careful examination of all the facts of the case, it seems probable that after the forma-
tion of the triassic conglomerate some of the calcareous pebbles in it underwent
decomposition ; that water holding chalcedony in solution, and passing through the
rock, deposited the chalcedony on the nucleus : the nucleus in some cases continued
to decompose, by which it was wholly or partially detached from its envelope, and
not unfrequently reduced to dust. Suppose the decomposition to have commenced
at various points or centres on the surface of the pebble, the chalcedony deposited at
these points would form central tubercles; let the decaying process extend from and
around these centres, the chalcedony deposited around each tubercle would form a
ring ; in like manner a succession of rings might be formed, until they touched, after
which a more comprehensive circle might invest two or more of the systems already
formed, until the whole surface would be covered.

On the Origin ofSaliferous Deposits. By Professor H. D. Rogers, Boston, U.S.

       On the Great Pterygotus (Seraphim) of Scotland and other Species.

    By J, W. Salter, F.G.S., of the Geological Survey of Great Britain,

   This paper was in some measure a continuation of one published in the Quarterly
Geological Journal for 1855, describing some new and large crustacean forms from
the uppermost Silurian rocks of the south of Scotland.

   They were described under the name of Himanthopterus, and were supposed to
differ from the published fragments of the great Pterygotus by the lateral position of

the large simple eyes.
   In the general shape of the body, however, the terminal joints and tail, in the want'

of appendages to the abdomen, as well as in the form and number of the swimming
feet, mandibles, maxillae and antennae, there was found to be on further examination
the closest resemblance between Himanthopterus and the great Pterygotus. And the
resemblance has been carried still further by the favourable collocation of all the
known specimens from the Scotch collections, which have furnished nearly all the
portions and also the head. This is now found to be exactly like that of Himan-

                                                      ;

thopterus, and to have lateral, not subcentral eyes, as represented by other authors.
   The two genei-a are therefore identical, and the group, as now constittited, includes

a number both of small and moderate-sized Crustacea, along with some which were
far larger than any living species, and which certainly attained a length of six or

eight feet.
--

--76 REPORT 1856.

  --The collections made by the Scottish geologists, those in Lord Kinnaird's cabinet,
--and in the Watt Institution, Dundee, in connexion with other specimens obtained

by Mr. Banks of Kington and Messrs. Lightbody and Cocking of Ludlow, show that
that Pterygotus was an elongate crustacean, with a comparatively small head and
sessile compound eyes ; and having but few appendages, of which the large chelate

--antennas are most remarkable, being a foot long, and only four-jointed, the terminal

joints forming a strong serrated claw. The large mandibles were fully six inches
long: the maxillfe were either one or two pairs, with six-jointed palpi ; and the great
swimming feet consisted of six joints, of which the terminal ones were modified for
swimming; the basal joints are great foliaceous expansions with crenulate edges, which

possibly' assisted, like the first joints of the legs in Limulus, in mastication.

   The singular piece called " Seraphim " by the workmen, is not, as formerly sup-
posed, a portion of the carapace, but in all probability the hypostome on the under
side of the front of the head, the central prong of which is really free, being the labrum
itself. The plate would be analogous to a similar piece on the under surface of the

--head of the Trilobite, of Apus, Limtdus, and many other Crustacea. No argument

seems necessary to show that it was not a portion of the upper surface, as indicated
by Mr. Page in his communication to the Section last year, since we possess the cara-
pace entire, and it is like that of all the other nine or ten species.

   From the explanation given by Mr. Huxley in the memoir above referred to, there
is a general resemblance both in form and structure to the small Stomapod Crustaceans,
Mysis and Cnrna, minute forms, which are now arranged very low down among the
Decapods, and which are frequently ornamented with a sculpture very similar to
that of the fossils. There is even a yet greater resemblance in form to the larvae of
the common crab. If this be accepted, the coincidence in essential structure between
such minute and embryonic forms and these gigantic denizens of the old seas be-
comes. most remarkable and interesting, as bearing on the course of development of

life throughout geological epochs.

        On some New Palceozoic Star-fishes, compared with living Forms.
                             ByJ.W. Salter, F.G.S.

   The object of the communication was chiefly to exhibit some new forms oi Asteri-
dce, from the Upper Silurian rocks ; and others which have all the aspect of Ophiurida:,
but are essentially distinguished by the number of ossicles which go to form a single

--segment of the arms the lower surface showing a double row of flat plates, and the

upper also being composed of two rows of plates, while the Ophiuridce have a single
plate above, and one below.

    There is, however, the closest similarity to the latter family in the length of the

arms and the restriction of the disc (Protdster, Forbes)*.
   The Star-fish proper belong to three and probably to more genera, all remarkable

for their membranous texture.
   In the great length of the spines on the margin, Palaocoma resembles Pteraster,

MiilL, while in the pentagonal form and simply plated integument of another genus
{Palasterind), there is a much nearer approach made to Asteriscus or Palmipes than to
any other type of living star-fish. One of the latter had been described from Sweden.

   A Lower Silurian form, originally described by Forbes as Uraster, has the disc

little developed or quite absent, but better specimens show it to have had but two rows
of suckers, and the avenues bordered by very large plates. This is also appai'ently
allied to Asteriscus, and I find that the name Palceaster has been proposed by Prof.
Hall for the genus, which is represented by five or six species.

   The genera are,
1. Palaeaster {Hall), without disc, avenues deep. Upper and Lower Silurian . . 6 sp.
2. Palasterina (M'Coy), pentagonal, disc moderate, plated. Upper Silurian , . 2sp.
3. Palseocoma (5'a/<er),disclooselyreticular,avenuesveryshallow. Upper Silurian. 5 sp.

4. Protaster (Forbes), disc small, arms long, extended, with two plates above  4 sp.
              and two below. Upper and Lower Silurian

There appear to be other forms yet undescribed.

   * Later observations (1857) have led the author to believe this genus to be a true Ophi-
urid, but of a new group.

Description of a Working Model to illustrate the formation of " Drift-bedding "

            (a kind offalse stratification). By H. C. Sorby, F.G.S.

   This model was constructed to explain the manner in -which that kind of false
stratification, for which the author has proposed the term " drift-hedding," is produced
by the sandy material being drifted along on the bottom, till the depth of the water
becomes so much greater, that the velocity of the current is not sufficient to wash it
any farther. It then accumulates in stratula, inclined to the horizontal plane at angles,
the value of which depends upon various circumstances. In the model, the drifting
effect of the current was intimated by a kind of coarse screw, which, when turned
round, carried forward the sand, supplied from a bag, along a groove, from which it
fell into a space with a glass front, where it accumulated at the angle of rest. Being
a mixture of heavy black fine grains of specular iron and coarser white quartz sand,
it became sorted by moving the screw alternately quickly and slowly, and thus accu-
mulated in black and white bands ; whereas, if it was moved with a uniform velocity,
no such bands were produced, but the coarse white particles collected at the bottom.
These effects, thus produced experimentally by an irregular or uniform forward
moving action of the screw, are precisely the same as what the author had previously
deduced to have been generated in strata of various geological periods by currents of
varying velocity ; and the appearance of the structure, thus formed in the model, so
closely agrees with what is so commonly met with in sandy rocks, that no one can
doubt how it originated. Such models may now be procured of Messrs. Chadburn

Brothers, Sheffield.

On the Magnesian Limestone having been formed by the alteration of an ordi-
                 nary calcareous deposit. By H. C. Sorbt, F.G.S.

   It is well known that crystals of calcareous spar are in some cases found changed
into dolomite, and that corals and other calcareous organisms are often altered in a
similar manner, and their organic structure obliterated. It is therefore clearly
proved that such a change may take place in calcareous rocks. Portions of the car-
boniferous and Devonian limestones have also frequently experienced this change,
and it has so taken place along joints and veins, that no explanation appears probable,
but the long-continued action of some soluble magnesian salt.

   When thin sections of such rocks are examined with the microscope, some trace of
the fragments of organic bodies of which they were composed may be seen in some
cases, but in many the original mechanical structure has been entirely obliterated by
the change, and there is now only a peculiar crystalline structure, chiefly due to the

more or less interfering action of minute rhombohedrons. The same is seen in thin
sections of the Permian dolomite ; so that a considerable portion, if not the whole,
appears, like other limestones, to have been derived from comminuted and decayed
calcareous organisms, and to have been subsequently altered into dolomite. If such be
the case, the author suggested that probably this alteration was effected by the infiltra-
tion of the soluble magnesian salts of the sea-water, under some peculiar conditions not
yet clearly explained, during the period when it became so far concentrated that rock-
salt was frequently deposited ; and that the calcareous salt removed during the change
had, by decomposition with the sulphatesof the sea-water, given rise to the accumula-
tions of gypsum. In support of this, it is an important fact, that some very solid dolo-
mite does even now still contain about one-fifth per cent, of salts soluble in water, con-
sisting of the chloride.i of sodium, magnesium, potassium and calcium, and sulphate of
lime, doubtless retained in the minute fluid cavities, seen with the microscope to exist
in great numbers. These, like those in most crystals formed from solution, must have
been produced at the same time as the dolomite, and caught in some of the solution
then present, which is thus indicated to have been of a briny character.

  A process the very reverse of that just described is now taking place by the action

of dissolved gypsum, by which sulphate of magnesia, frequently efflorescing on the

surface of the rock, and carbonate of lime are produced ; and this may perhaps, in
some cases, explain why the upper beds of the Permian limestone are now more cal-

careous than the lower.

   On the Microscopical Structure of Mica-Schist, By H. C. Sorby, F.G.S.

    The examination of thin transparent sections of mica-schist and the allied rocks
shows that there exist two very marked varieties, characterized by the manner in
which the flaky crystals of mica are arranged. In one they lie more or less closely
in the plane of the alternating layers of different mineral composition^ and, when
these are bent into complicated contortions, they also continue to coincide with them;
whilst in the other variety they lie in one particular plane, and, instead of varying in
direction in sharp contortions, they still remain throughout more or less closely in
the same general line. This structure then is similar to cleavage in a contorted
slate rock; and its direction in like manner coincides witli tlie axis planes of the
contortions, and varies from the general direction in the same particulars. One
structure is as if chemical and crystalline changes had occurred in a rock that
possessed no slaty cleavage, the arrangement of the particles due to stratification
having caused the crystals of mica to be formed in its plane, which may or may not
have been subsequently contorted. For this the author proposes the term " stratifica-
tion foliation,'' to distinguish it from the other that may be called " cleavage folia-
tion," which is as if the rock had been compressed in such a manner as to alter the
ultimate structure and develope slaty cleavage, before the large crystals of mica were
formed. Then, when the subsequent crystalline changes occurred, the minute flakes
of mica, placed more or less closely in the plane of cleavage by the change in the
dimensions of the rock, grew up into larger crystals in the same general line of clea-
vage. The distribution of these two kinds of mica-schist follows general laws similar
to that of cleaved and luicleaved slates.- For instance, in the coast section south of
Aberdeen, most of the rocks possess cleavage foliation, whereas in the Loch Lomond

district there is simply stratification foliation.

   The author particularly argued that the peculiarities in the rocks having cleavage
foliation cannot be explained except by supposing that they have been metamorphosed
stratified rocks ; for their structure so clearly shows the effects of both stratification
and slaty cleavage, and that the cause- of the separation into layers of different mine-

--ral composition is pre-existing stratification, and is in no way analogous to that which

produced the cleavage of slates that the cleavage foliation is the effect of previously
existing cleavage, and not that slaty cleavage is a partially developed foliation.

   Attention was also drawn to the vast numbers of minute fluid cavities, containing
water, that occur in the quartz laj'ers in mica-schist ; being analogous to those found
almost invariably in crystals formed from solution, and not in those produced by
simple fusion. These indicate that the metamorphic changes have been due to an
aqueous process, or else minute globules of water could not thus have been caught
in the solid crystals during their formation. Probably an ilevated temperature was
also concerned in the change, but not heat alone and a simple partial fusion.

   In mica-schist there is often a peculiar structure, which in many cases might easily
be confounded with slaty cleavage. This is when the rock has been so bent into sharp

cramples or small contortions, that planes of weakness or actual joint fractures have

been produced. These may be so close as to appear just like slaty cleavage to the

naked eye, but are seen with the microscope to be quite distinct ; being finite divi-
sions, and not an ultimate structure as it is. Both occur occasionally in the same
clay-slate, and then give rise to what has been described as double-cleaved slate.

the Rev. J. MacEnery's original memoir, which gives a most graphic account of the
first discovery of fossil remains in the cavern, and which is thus referred to by

--Professor Owen in his ' Fossil Mammalia:' Perhaps the richest depository of

bears hitherto found in England is that called Kent's Hole near Torquay. It is to
the assiduous researches of the Rev. Mr. MacEnery, that the discovery of the
various and interesting fossils of this cave are principally due, and some of the rarest
and most valuable of this gentleman's collection have been recently acquired by the

British Museum. M. de Blainville frequently cites 'A description of the cavern of
Kent's Hole, Devonshire,' which he supposes to have been pubhshed by Mr. Mac-

Enery, but whichhe regrets that he had not been able to procure. I have been assured
by Dr. Buckland that Mr. MacEnery never published such a work, and it is most
probable that the drawing or lithographic impressions, shown by Mr. MacEnery
to Professor Blainville, were those designed to illustrate the forthcoming second
volume of the ' Reliquiae Diluvianse.' " Mr. Vivian had recovered the original rough
notes of this memoir, which had been disposed of at the sale of Mr. MacEnery's
collection, and proposes shortly to edit it with annotations in a connected form.

  -- AThe following extract is a specimen of the geological portion of the work:

    The Bear's Den. " curtain of stalactite, with depending clusters of spar at
certain intervals, and corresponding eminences on the floor, was the picture this
chamber presented when we first saw it. It was floored through its entire extent
with a continuous sheet of stalagmite, siliceo-calcareous and crystalline, so diflScult
to penetrate, that after repeated attempts we abandoned it in despair ; at length,

availing ourselves of cracks that traversed it, like the divisions in a pavement, we
succeeded in ripping it up. All we had hitherto observed vanished in interest before
this disclosure. The first flag that was turned over, exhibited in relief groups of

skulls and bones adhering to the stalagmite. Each successive flag repeated the same
spectacle. It is to be regretted that their size prevented us from transferring them
at once, as they were found, to our museums ; for while they lay in the chamber
awaiting their removal, some persons, who had heard of the discovery, broke into the
cavern, and either tore away or disfigured the masses. SuflScient, however, have
been preserved to give an idea of the accumulation and character of the remains in

this quarter.

   " The remains of Bear prevail here to the exclusion of all others, of all ages, and of
all periods down to their encasement in the mud ; some of the teeth have the
most dazzling enamel, and the bones retain their natural freshness, as if derived from

animals in high health destroyed for the sake of their skeletons ; others, on the con-
trary, are of a darkish brown, with the texture of the bone decayed from long expo-
sure, and only kept together by the calcareous and ferruginous matter with which
they are saturated ; even the enamel is of a greenish tinge. Owing to the induration
of their earthy enclosure or their encrustation by stalagmite, few were extracted

entire. Two skulls were buried in the stalagmite as in a mould, and were brought
away in that state. The spar has formed into a variety of specular crystals in their

chambers. The skulls were severed in two ; the front separated from the occiput

and found apart, the other parts of the skeletons lay about in all directions without
any order ; generally we were able to trace the natural relation of the parts
in some instances; but. in no case were they or the skulls broken or gnawed like
those in other parts. The long bones were found generally entire, and when found

broken, it was only mechanically, from pressure. In no instance have they exhibited

indications of being broken or gnawed by the jaws of carnivorous animals for the
sake of their flesh or marrow. In fine, they were precisely in the state of bones that

belonged to animals that died by a natural death on the spot during a succession of
ages, whose remains had long laid about on the surface, subject to be trampled upon
by the feet of their own species that made this branch their haunt. In this respect
this section of the cavern resembles the caves of Germany, in the predominance of

the Bear, in the identity of the species, and in the unbroken condition of the remains.

It is worthy of remark, that the remains of the Ursus cultridens do not appear here

any more than among the Bears in the German caves, though they do, as we shall
see, in the other chambers with bones of Elephants. To enhance the wonder of

this anomalous scene, there appeared, and there still exist attached to the under sur-
face of one of the pyramidal mounds in this chamber, lumps of Album Gracum ;
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

but of other traces of the presence of the Hyaena there is not a shadow, nor indeed
of any other animal, except in its outskirts, as shown by the fractured jaws of Ursus
speleeus and ailtridens. In the German caves we know that the remains of the
Hyaena generally accompany those of the Bear, and under such circumstances as to
warrant the inference that certain species, at least, if not all, lived in good intelligence
together. In the centre of this chamber there was a double floor of stalagmite, be-
tween which was interposed a stratum of rubble sparry pipes, a black flint knife and
spots of charcoal, with shells of mussel and oyster, but no red marl or its usual
contents. The rest of the floor was regularly stratified in red and white laminae, ex-
hibiting no vestiges of adventitious matter or of interruption. The position of the

rubbly stratum occurring half-way down the section of the stalagmite, inclines me
to refer it to the same cause and epoch as the seam containing the Bears' remains
at the entrance of the Arcade of which we have already spoken."

On the Evidence of a Reef of Lower Lias Rock, extending from Robin Hood's
    Bay to the neighbourhood of Flamborough Head. By Capt. Woodall.

    Capt.Woodall called attention to the fact that this reef joined the land at the point
where the lower lias is thrown up in contact with the inferior oolite of that part

of Yorkshire. He produced a specimen, which he had obtained twenty miles to the

south-east of Robin Hood's Bay, from a depth of 20 fathoms, and attempted to prove,
from the softness of the specimen, that the reef was liassic throughout. The very
straight inner margin of the reef, which extends twenty miles and upwards in one straight
line, was another reason for such argimient; and, by comparing the fossils contained
in the specimen exhibited witli some from the boulders of the Holderness coast, he
thought that there was a probability that those fossils had originally been derived
from this submerged area.

    On the Occurrence of Upper Lias Ammonites in the (so-called) Basement
       Beds of the Inferior Oolite. By Thomas Wright, M.D., F.R.S.E.

    The brown sands which lie at the base of the Inferior Oolite are capped in some
 localities, as at Beacon Hill, Frocester Hill, and Wotton-under-Edge in Gloucester-
 shire, and in several places in Somersetshire and Dorsetshire, by a remarkable bed
 containing a great number of Ammonites, Belemnites and Nautili, and which the
 author designates " the Cephalopoda bed ; " by far the greater number of the
 ammonites contained in these deposits, have not been figured in the ' Mineral
 Conchology of Great Britain,' and are for the most part new as English fossils. Many
 of the same species of Ammonites as those exhibited are found in France and Ger-
 many, in strata which are regarded by the palteontologists of those countries as the
 uppermost zone of the Upper Lias, and are only found in that particular horizon
 whereas the equivalent strata in England have been described as the basement beds of

 the Inferior Oolite.
     In the localities already enumerated the brown sands are overlaid by a bed of coarse

 brown marly limestone, full of small, dark, ferruginous grains of the hydrate of iron,
 which impart an iron-shot aspect to the rock : fossils are very abundant in this bed,
 which attains only a few feet in thickness ; the true position of the Cephalopoda bed
 is shown in the sections of Frocester Hill and Wotton-under-Edge, now exhibited.
 Beneath this fossiliferous band or Ammonite bed are the so-called sands of the Infe-
 rior Oolite, consisting of fine brown and yellow calcareous sands, often micaceous,
 and attaining a thickness of from 2 to 150 feet. The sands contain in their upper
 part inconstant layers of siliceo-calcareons sandstone, and sometimes in their lower
 part inconstant concretionary masses of coarse sandstone, the lowest beds becoming
 blue and marly, and passing insensibly into the clays of the Upper Lias. The sands
 themselves are not fossiliferous, but sometimes nodules lying near their base are found
  to contain organic remains.

    When unquestionable sections such as those at Beacon Hill, Frocester Hill, and

 Wotton-under-Edge exist, it becomes a matter of great interest to study the boun-
  dary between two such formations as the Lias and Inferior Oolite, as the general
 principles developed in the investigation of this question apply equally to other frontier

stratigrapliical lines. The lithological characters, and other physical evidence, assist
the investigation, but do not enable the geologist to assign exact limits to such con-
tiguous formations. It is here that the value of palaeontological evidence becomes
so important; for without its aid it would be impossible to say where one rock group
terminates and another begins : this testimony of the rocks proves, that it is by the
zones of life alone that the line of separation between the Lias and the Inferior Oolite
can be drawn, and that if we accept this view of the subject, w^e are bound to admit
that a considerable deposit, which has hitherto been grouped with the Inferior Oolite,
must be transferred to the Upper Lias, of which it forms its highest stage.

    All the Cephalopoda of the above list are found only in the uppermost zone of the

Upper Lias of France and Germany, with the exception of Amm. hifrons, which

occupies always a lower zone, and at Frocester is contained in the nodules towards

the base of the sands; one gasteropod and seventeen species of Conchifera, found in

the Ammonite  bed,  extend  upwards  into  the  Inferior Oolite                                                                the species marked  with
                                                                                                                            ;

an asterisk (*) form the series which are common to the Cephalopoda bed, and to the

limestones of the Inferior Oolite. All the others are either Upper Lias forms or are

special to this bed.

   One of the Brachiopods, Bhynchonella cynocephala, is found only in the Cepha-

lopoda bed, whilst Terebratula suhpunclata descends into the marlstone.
   The author contended that all classes of the Mollusca are not of the same value to

the pakeontologist in stratigraphical geology, as some have a much wider range than
others ; for example, certain species of Conchifera extend through the Lower and
Middle Lias, others pass from the Inferior Oolite into the Cornbrash, and even into
the Coral rag, whilst the different zones of the Lias, and the several stages of the
oolitic rocks, are all characterized by distinct species of Ammonites, which are limited

to these different horizons of life; for this reason Cephalopoda are regarded as better

indicators of geological time than Conchifera; as none of the twenty-one species of

Ammonites, Belemnites and Nautili passed from the Cephalopoda bed into the In-
ferior Oolite, and were all identical with Upper Lias forms, it was inferred that the
Cephalopoda bed represented the Jurensis-marl of German authors, or the uppermost

zone of tl)e Upper Lias.
   The author further showed that the Inferior Oolite contains fourteen species of

Ammonites, two Nautili, one Belemnite, ten species of Gasteropoda, forty species of

Conchifera, ten species of Brachiopoda, eight species of Annelida, twenty-two species

Aof Echinodermata, and fourteen species of ntkozoa, not one of which was found in

the Cephalopoda bed on which the Inferior Oolite immediately rests.
   The Dorsetshire sections confirm the same conclusions, but the lists of. fossils from

these rocks are not so complete as those furnished by the Gloucestershire sections;

the author had not collected many of his Dorsetshire fossils himself, and was unable
to decide on the stratigraphical position of many of his specimens. Ammonites Dorset-

ensis, Wright, has not yet been found in the Cotteswold hills, although it is most

abundant in several localities in Dorsetshire.
   The Cephalopoda bed is regarded as the English equivalent of the " Ores supra-

liassique ou marly sandstone" of M. Terquem, as developed in the department of the

Moselle.

the Province of Luxembourg.

the uppermost of his Schwarzer Jura (Lias).
   The Jurensis-marl of Dr. Fraas, in his table of the Jura formation of Suabia.
   The positive palaeontological evidence leads the author to group his Cephalopoda

bed with the uppermost zone of the Lias, specifically characterized by Ammonites
Jurensis and variabilis, and Rhynchonella cynocephala, and the other forty-four
species special to this bed ; and negatively separated from the Inferior Oolite which

rests upon it, by the one hundred and twenty species which appear for the first time

in that stage.
    Besides the forty- seven species which have hitherto been found only in the Cepha-

lopoda bed, there are eighteen species which are common to this bed and the Infe-

rior Oolite ; but these are chiefly Conchifera, which have a wide vertical range, whilst
the Cephalopoda, which are special to it, have a very limited distribution in time
both positive and negative evidence therefore support the conclusion that the Cepha-
lopoda bed and sands belong to the uppermost part of the Upper Lias, and not to
the Inferior Oolite with which they have hitherto been classed.

On a supposed Fossil Fucus found at Aust Cliff, Gloucestershire.
                 By C. C. Babington, M.A., F.R.S.

Above the well-known bed containing fossils occupying the higher part of Aust

Cliff, there is a bed of laminated rock nearly, or quite, devoid of fossil remains.

Lately a fall of the cliff brought down a part of this upper stratum, when Mr.

Brodie, the author of a well-known work on fossil insects, found between some of

the thin plates of stone a substance closely resembling a Fucus. There being no

apparent mode of accounting for its presence in that position, and no reason except

its very modern appearance for doubting its fossil character, Mr. Brodie and other

geologists and naturalists inclined to think it of ancient origin, and for that reason

presented it to the notice of the Section. Several naturalists examined the specimen,

and thought it possible that it might be a recent product, a Rhizomorpha, which

Ahad intruded itself between the plates of stone.                             careful microscopic examination

alone can determine if it is of fungoid or algal structure, of recent or fossil date.

Notes on Experiments in the Botanical Garden of the Royal Agricultural College.

   By Professor Buckman, F.G.S., of the Agricultural College, Cirencester.

In this paper the author first described the soil and situation of the ZocaZe occupied

as his garden, which, from being situate on Forest Marble Clay, is of a somewhat

sterile character. The experimental portion is divided into 200 plots, most of which

are 2i yards square, some double that size, and a few still larger, now engaged for

experiments with various manures. The plots are employed at the present time with

--crops mostly experimental, in the following classes : grasses, 82; papilionaceous

feeding-plants, 25 ; crops for green food, 12 ; wheat, 6 ; garden vegetables, 5 ; turnips,
experiments with manures, 14 ; economic plants, 13 ; flowering and ornamental

plants, 40: total, 197. For the grasses many observations were given tending to

--show that several so-called species prove in cultivation to be varieties, instances of

which were given in the following genera : Bromus, Festuca, and Agrostis. One

case in particular of the three following forms of Festuca, F. loliacea, F. pratensis,

and F. elatior, were shown to have been produced from the same seed by the gradual

change of the first two into the latter. In the Papilionaceae the author pointed out

the production of the spring and winter varieties of Vetch from the V. angustifolia.

In the genus Trifolium he made the following remarks on T. pratense and T. medium.

The T. pratense occurs wild in all good and rich meadows and pastures; its place,

however, in poor sandy soils is supplied by the T. medium, on which account the

latter plant was some few years since introduced into agriculture to ensure a crop

when the former usually failed. The seedsmen used to supply it under its botanical

name of  T.  medium                                but  it is a  curious  circumstance  that all the samples of this  seed
                                                ;

now in the market show it to be but a variety of T. pratense, and hence, at present,

the best informed seedsmen no longer send it out under the original botanical desig-

--nation of T. medium, but under that of T. pratense perenne, the fact being well

established that we have two varieties of broad clover in cultivation, whilst the true

T. medium has been entirely lost to agriculture ; and the whole evidence with respect
to this subject showed that it has not been lost from neglect, but that it has merged

into T. pratense ; and if so, it remains as a most interesting matter for experiment,
especially when it is considered that no doubt has been entertained by botanists of

their distinction as species. Many experiments of a like kind were described, and

their practical utility clearly pointed out.

On New Forms of Diatomacea from the Firth of Clyde. By Professor Gkegoky,

                                                       Edinburgh,

   The author, after referring to two papers by himself on the Diatoms of the Glen-
shira Sand, the marine forms in which must have come from the Firth of Clyde,
proceeded to describe the material now under investigation. It is remarkable that
of all the many undescribed marine forms found in the Glenshira Sand, not one has

more than dirt washed from some nests of Lima hians, dredged by Prof. Allman off

Campylodiscus simulans, W. G. ; and another disc not yet named. It thus appears

that about thirty of the new marine forms of the Glenshira Sand occur in this ma-

--terial, as might be anticipated from the connexion between Glenshira and Loch Fyne

which is an arm of the Firth of Chde. 4. Many forms which appear to be entirely

new. These consist of a. Navicuiae and Pinnularise, of which there are several,

chiefly small ; but there is one very fine large Navicula, of very peculiar aspect, which

proves to be N. proetexta, Ehr. It has a marginal and two medial striated bands,

and the space between these is irregularly powdered with round granules, the same

as those of which the striae are made up. One of the smaller forms exhibits,

at one focal distance, a striated marginal band, at another the whole valve is seen

to be striated. There are several others, which the author has not had time as
yet to study. 6. Filamentous forms, of which there are several. One is ap-

parently' a Denticula, a fine large form, which, as no marine species of the
genus are known in Britain, the author names, provisionally, Denticula marina.
Four appear to be species of Zygoceros, two of which are rather large, and two

smaller. One frequent form is that named by Smith, from the front view alone,

Himanlidium Williamsoni. The side view proves it to be not a Himantidium ; and it

Ais probably a Diadesmis.                             predominant form in the material is a small disc, possi-
=bly Coscinodiscus minor, Sm. But it is here seen to be an Orthocira. c. Cocco-

neides. There appear to be three or four species of Cocconeis, which are only

mentioned, not having been fully studied. Two of these are allied to C. distans,

which also occurs as above stated, and is both frequent and fine, and, notwithstand-

ing the opinion of Prof. Smith, is held by the author to be entirely distinct from C.

Scutellum d. Discs. These are some apparently new discs, one of which is a large

CCampylodiscus, allied to RaJfsii, which the author has also found in the Glenshira

Sand, but has not yet described, e. Amphorae. Of this genus, of which the Glen-
shira Sand has yielded so many and such remarkable new species, this material, be-

sides several of the Glenshira forms, including two of the finest, A. crassa and A. Gre-
villiana, has yielded a large number of new, and in most cases very remarkable spe-

              On the Development of the Embryo of Flowering Plants.
By Arthur Henfrey, F.R.S., Professor of Botany in King's College, London.

All those who have devoted attention to the study of vegetable physiology, are

aware that a controversy has been carried on pretty actively of late years, regarding
the real mode of origin of the primary cell, from which the embryo becomes deve-

loped in the seeds of the higher plants. On one hand. Prof. Schleiden has asserted

that the "germ-cell" is produced in the end of the pollen-tube, after this organ

has penetrated to the nucleus of the ovule. Until very lately, Schleiden has firmly

adhered to this opinion, and it has been most actively defended by Dr. Schacht in

various memoirs, receiving additional support also in a few other less important

quarters. On the other hand. Prof. Amici, about ten years ago, announced his

conviction that Schleiden and the pollinists were mistaken, and, moreover, showed

that in certain species of Orchis and other plants the germ-cell originates quite inde-

pendently in the embryo-sac, and is merely fertilized by the contents of the pollen-

tube. Amici's views have been confirmed, and the illustrations of the doctrine

extended, by Von Mohl, Hofmeister, and others, among whom the author of this
paper may be counted. M. Tulasne also may be ranked, for his later researches, in

the same company, although he differs in his conclusions in a subordinate point, he

having been unable to detect the germ-cells in the embryo-sac prior to fertilization,

although he finds them originating quite independently of the pollen-tube after this

has exerted its influence. This discrepancy is perhaps explicable, by the perishable

condition in which the germinal body has now been ascertained to exist, previously

to its impregnation by the pollen-tube.

In the course of the last twelve months the aspect of the present question has

undergone a most striking change, depending not only on the total surrender of one

of the conflicting parties, but on the recognition of a totally new point, throwing

very considerable light on the true nature of the analogies existing between the pro-

cesses of reproduction in vegetables generally. The author is induced to lay the

particulars of the recent occurrences before the British Association, not only on

account of the importance of certain of the facts, but by the circumstance that his

long- continued researches on this subject have been rewarded by his being the

first to recognize what he believes to be the essential point in the process of fecun-

dation.

   In the first place, to dismiss certain matters which now belong only to the history
of this question, it may be stated that Schleiden, the originator of the pollinic hypo-

thesis, has become convinced that it is erroneous. One of his pupils. Dr. Radlkofer

of Munich, published in the early part of this year, some researches carried on under

the  auspices  of  Prof.  Schleiden                                                         and  in  the  relation  of his  results, he  makes  the
                                                                                         ;

statement, that he is authorized by Schleiden to publish that author's admission

that the prepai-ations figured in the memoir demonstrate the existence of the germinal

vesicles as independent bodies before the pollen-tube reaches the embryo-sac. So

far, therefore, as that point was concerned, Amici's doctrine might be considered

substantiated, although it still remained to obtain the acknowledgment of error on
the part of Dr. Schacht. That physiologist was in Madeira at the time Dr. Radl-

kofer's pamphlet appeared, pursuing his physiological researches ; and we have just
received a report of a communication sent by him to Berlin, containing not only

the required admission, but a remarkable confirmation of a new and most important

point, which had been brought foi-ward in the mean time by the author of this

notice.

From the time when I carefully repeated Amici's observations on Orchis years

ago, I have been convinced that he was right in regard to the independence and

pre-existence of the germinal bodies in the embryo-sac. Every summer I have
prosecuted researches on this subject, with a view to overcome the obstinate resist-

ance of the pollinists. During last year, I was led to observe certain minute cha-

racteristics of the germinal vesicles, and to . apply reagents to them, in order to
ascertain more accurately their conditions in various stages. In the article " Ovule "

of the ' Micrographic Dictionarj',' published last autumn, I stated that I had good

reason for believing that the germinal bodies did not possess a cellulose coat until

myafter impregnation. I had not leisure until the completion of that work to bring

notes into a fit state for publication, but in February I forwarded a paper to the
Linnean Societj' of London, which was read on the 4th of March, in which the
new discovery was fully illustrated and explained, as observed in the ovules of San-

talum album. That memoir contained many details respecting the development of
the ovule in all its stages ; but the point of greatest physiological importance, and of
absolute novelt)', was the demonstration, that previously to the period when the

pollen-tube reaches the embryo-sac, the germinal vesicles, or rather "corpuscles,"
are not perfect cells in the old and ordinary acceptation of the term in vegetable
anatomy, but are merely definitely-bounded, spherical or ellipsoidal masses of gra-
nular protoplusm ; being, in fact, in the same condition as the zoospores of the Con-
fervoid Algae, before they are discharged from the parent-cell in swarming. The

pollen-tube reaches the summit of the erabryo-sac, and adheres very firmly to it.

It was not decided whether the membranes gave way, so as to allow the contents
of the pollen-tube to be discharged into the embryo-sac, but this appeared probable.
The result of the application of the pollen-tube to the end of the erabryo-sac above
the germinal corpuscles, was very quickly evident in the appearance of a solid cellu-
lose membrane as a new coat to that germinal corpuscle which was to give origin to
the embryo, converting it into a perfect cell. This cell then became divided into
two by a transverse septum, the upper half forming the " suspensor"-cel!, while
the lower increased in size, and by cell-division became a cellular mass, ultimately

taking the proper form of the embryo.

   Botanists who are acquainted with the recent discoveries of Thuret, Pringsheim,
Cohn and others in the reproduction of the Algse, will see the interesting connexion
which exists between the process above described, and the phaenomena of fecunda-
tion of the species of the lower plants. I have dwelt upon this in the memoir
presented to the Linnean Society, and stated my opinion, since confirmed by further

observation, that the germinal corpuscle of the archegonium of the Ferns is likewise

destitute of a cellulose coat until it is fertilized by the contact of the spermatozoids.
    I send with this notice some drawings illustrating the phaenomena presented in

the fertilization of the ovule of Santalum.

Having arrived at the above views, it was with great pleasure I last week received

the report of the May sitting of the Berlin Academy, containing a paper by Dr.

Schacht, transmitted from Madeira, with the date of April, on the same subject,

myand confirming  account in all essential respects. His observations on the ovule

of Gladiolus segetum have induced him not only to admit the error in his long and

warm advocacy of the pollinic hypothesis, but to assert that the germinal corpuscles

are, as stated by me, pre-existent as protoplasmic masses destitute of a membrane,

and that their conversion into true cells, with a cellulose wall, is the result, and the

first evidence of the process of fertilization by the arteries of the pollen-tube. This

corroboration of my statements by an independent observer, is very satisfactory,

seeing the delicacy of the observations on which they rest; but it may be observed,

that the new views form a natural development of those previously entertained by
Amici's school, resulting from a more minute attention to the nature of " cell-con-

tents" than was formerly paid. It is probable that part of the error of the pollinists,

together with Tulasne's inability to find the germinal corpuscles before impregnation,

may have arisen from the great liability to destruction of the corpuscles by external

Weagents, and alteration by endosmose.  have observed them best either by moist-

ening the fresh preparations with solution of sugar instead of pure water, or by

On the Triiicoidal Forms q/"iEgilops and on the Specific Identity of Centaurea
   nigra and C. nigrescens. By the Rev. Professor Henslow, M.A., F.R.S.

In this paper the Professor recorded the result of his own experiments, in which

he had so far succeeded in changing the character of jEgilops squarrosa as to lead

^.him to conclude that M. Fabre's original statement, that  ovata was the origin

of the domestic wheat, Triticum sativum, was not altogether without foundation.
He exhibited specimens in which the form of jEgilops squarrosa had undergone

considerable change ; but he had not succeeded in obtaining the characters of Triti-

seen that cultivated specimens of seedling plants had completely passed into the
form of C. nigra. He then referred to instances of species of Rosa, Primula, and
Anagallis, passing one into the other.

  On the Movements of Oscillatoria. By Professor G. B. Knowles, F.L.S.,
                                      Queen's College, Birmingham.

   The OscillatorijE belong to a group of plants which seem to stand immediately
between the animal and vegetable kingdoms. After very careful and repeated exa-
minations, the author has fully satisfied himself that the motions of this family of
freshwater Algae are entirely independent of any electrical influence ; of any current
in the fluid in which they are placed ; or of any effort to recover their straight posi-
tion. The motions, in fact, have very much the appearance of being spontaneous
an opinion in which Prof. Knowles is pleased to find that Captain Carmichael, who
devoted his attention for many years to the investigation of marine and freshwater

algae, fully concurs.

   Many of the larger Oscillatoriae, if carefully watched, may be seen to move in

various directions, sometimes to the right, sometimes to the left ; sometimes slowly,
sometimes briskly. The author, however, never perceived in them anything like an
effort to recover the straight position which is considered to be natural to them.

On the contrary, they may often be observed to hend gradually, so as to form a very

considerable curve ; to return again to the straight position, and then to hend in an
opposite direction. They have also a progressive motion ; and two filaments lying

side by side, may frequently be seen advancing in opposite directions on the field of
the microscope. This progressive motion, in all probability, is effected by means of
cilia, although they have not hitherto been detected. Of the correctness of these
facts any one may readily convince himself, by examining with a little attention
fresh specimens of any of the larger Oscillatoriae.

On the genus Abrothallus, De Nrs. By W. Lauder Lindsay, M.B., Perth.

    The genus Abrothallus has long been misunderstood and little known by botanists.
 Its species have generally been regarded either as the abortive, monstrous or acces-

--sory apothecia of various common lichens : as parasitic species of Endocarpon or

 Lecidea ; or as parasitic Fungi. They are athalline : hence the apothecia, which
are very minute, almost microscopic, may be said to constitute the plants. They
are parasitic on the thallus of various common foliaceous lichens belonging to the
 genera Parmeliu, Cetraria and Sticta ; and are esi)ecially abundant on furfuraceous
 states of Parmelia saxatilis. Though comparatively unknown to British botanists.
 Dr. L. has met with them plentifully on old road-side walls, and more sparingly on
 boulders, rocks, and trees, both in the Highlands and Lowlands of Scotland ; and
 more particularly in the neighbourhood of Perth, Dui.keld, Braemar, Glen Shee,
 Lochaber, Skve, and Dumfries. The genus is specially interesting, from possessing,

-- --in addition to the ordinary reproductive organs, the spores and sperraatia,- of

 other lichens, accessory, leproductive bodies, siylospores, contained in minute
 microscopic conceptacles, termed by Tulasne Pycniod^s. The presence of stylo-
 spores and the absence of a tballus, tend to assimilate this genus closely to the
 Fungi, between which and the lichens the marks of differentiation are daily beco-
 ming less and less distinct.

     The first approach to a satisfactory examination and description of the genus was
 made by De Notaris, who, however, was led into various eirors regarding its struc-
 ture. He described it as possessing a small, delicate thallus ; hence the name
 which he bestowed on the genus. This thallus is now ascertained to belong to, or
  to be a modified portion or anamorphosis of, the ihuWus of Parmelia saxaiilis, or
  other lichen, on which the Ahrolhallvs is parasitic. His errors were corrected by
  Tulasne, in a monograph cm the genus Jbrot/tallun, and certain allied parasitic
  genera, included in his elaborate and valuable memoir on the minute anatomy of
  the lichens, published in the 'Annales des Sciences Naturelles' for 1852. The
  results of Dr. Lindsay's examination of a large number of Scotch specimens, have

led him, however, to take a somewhat different view of the numbers and characters
of the species ; and have enabled him to supply certain important omissions, and to
correct various minor errors of previous observers. He has been the first, it is
believed, to observe and describe the sperraogones and spermatia of the genus ; and
thus to give a complete account of its minute anatomy. The structure of the apo-
thecia appears to entitle this genus to be classed in the natural family of the Leci-

deacea. Tulasne desciibes the five following species :

 Notice of the Natural Printing of Sea-Weeds on the Rocks in the vicinity of

                   Stromness, Orkney. By Charles W. Peach.

   The author found, on the rocks near Stromness, by the sea-side, distinct impres-
sions of living Algae, Desmarestia ligulata, Halidrys siliquosa, Fucus nodosus, and
 several others. It appeared that in some cases the stone (micaceous Old Red Sand-
stone) had been covered by a Leathsia ?, that this was corroded by the larger sea-
weeds, so that their forms appeared slightly impressed, and of a yellow colour. In
other cases no preparatory growth of Leathsia was observed, but the stone was
slightly excavated, and darkened in colour. The author showed the bearing of this
observation in cases of plant-like forms in the Lower Palaeozoic strata of Cornwall,
 where no trace of carbonaceous matter appeared.

                                         By Joshua Alder.

     The paper contained descriptions of thirteen new species, found by the author on
 the coasts of Northumberland and Durham. They include two new genera, and
 another genus not before recorded as European. They are as follows : Voriidava,
 a new genus allied to Clava, but differing in having the tentacles in two regular circles
 round the head, and dissimilar. The species F. humilis has five tentacles in the
 upper row, and ten in the lower. Eudendrimn confectum, a small species encrust-

ing old univalve shells, and having much the habit of a Hydractinia. E. capillare,
a minute slender-branched species, having the polypes and reproductive capsules on

different branches. Sertularia tricuspidata, somewhat resembling S. polyzonias,

but more nearly allied to a New Zealand species (S. Johnstoni, Gray). It has three-

toothed apertures to the cells. Sertularia tenella, a species supposed by Dr. John-

--ston to be a variety of S. rugosa with the habit of S. polyzonias, but it differs from both

in some of its characters. Campanidaria volulilis, C. Johnstoni, and C. Hincksii.

The Linnean species is re-described for the purpose of distinguishing it from the

other two, which have been confounded with it. According to the opinion of the

author, the C. volubilis of Johnston differs from that of Ellis. The latter is considered

Cto be the Linnean type, and the second species is named  Johnstoni. They differ

Ain the form of their ovicapsules, as well as in other particulars.  third species,

with the margin of the cell sculptured in a castellated form, had been previously ob-

--served by the Rev. T. Hincks, and is here called C. Hincksii. C. gracillima, a
--species allied to C. dumosa. Grammaria, a genus lately described by Mr. Stimpson

in 'A Synopsis of the Marine Invertebrata of Grand Manan,' published by the Smith-
sonian Institution of Washington. The British species, now first noticed, comes

--very near to the G. rohtista of Stimpson, but differs in being much branched. It is

called G. ramosa. Bushia, a new genus of Polyzoa, belonging to the family Vesi-

culariadse. It is parasitical, and consists of small cells, closely adhering to other

substances, with marginal spines also adhering. They are united by a creeping fibre.

The species B. nitens is minute, shining, and horn-coloured. Farrella pedicellata.

Found on old shells from deep water. It differs from the Laguncula {Farrella) elon-

gata of Van Beneden in the great length and slenderness of the pedicle, and in some

other respects. Alcyonidiiim mammillatum, an encrusting species, found on old

shells, distinguished by the size of the papillae. A. albidum, enveloping the stem of

Plumularia falcata with prominent whitish polypides.

  A skull of a Manatee, obtained by Dr. Baikie in Africa, was exhibited to the

Observations on the Acalephce, with respect to Organs of Circulation and Respi-

      ration. By Professor J. H. Corbett, M.JD., Queen's College, Cork,

   In this communication the author claimed for the Acalephse a degree of organi-
zation higher than that usually conceded to them, and which might be supposed

consistent with so soft and perishable a structure. He described two different sets of

vessels-- a centrifugal and centripetal ; the former divide, subdivide, and anastomose,
as they proceed towards the circumference of the disc ; the latter larger, but less in
number, commence towards the circumference and pass in straight lines towards
the centre, where they become connected with the plaited red bands which are
disposed around the gastric cavity. It seems evident that the tubes which circulate
the nutritive fluid are not simply gastro vascular canals as generally described, but
really vessels which assist in maintaining a complete circulation. The four bands
situated around the gastric cavity are considered by recent authors as exclusively
the organs of reproduction, consisting of vesicles which contain sperm-cells in the
male and ova in the female. The contributor of this paper believes these to be
compound parts, and states that the vascular plaited bands are organized in an
appropriate manner for carrying on the respiratory action, while the contained
vesicles are the agents of the reproductive function. According to some writers,
respiration is accomplished by the agency of the cilia, which are attached along the
margin of the disc ; but as ciliary appendages are frequently absent amongst the
Medusae, such a view cannot be considered as satisfactory.

   The following considerations seem to indicate that the membranous constituents
of these bands are branchial or respiratory organs :-- 1st, by their position around

the gastiic cavity and their continuity with the membrane which lines it ; 2ndly, by

their connexion with  the vessels                                                   3rdly, that a rhythmical action of the                             entire' disc

and of these bands takes place both by day and during night, as carefully observed

by the author; 4thly, by an alteration in their colour when respiration is retarded;

5thly, by the diminution which occurs in one of these bands, if an injury happen

to be inflicted, on the corresponding portion of the disc, while the others preserve

their condition unchanged.

On the Pearls of the Conway River, North Wales, with some Observations on
  the Natural Productions of the Neighbou7-ing Coast. By Robert Garner,

   Though the Uiiio margaritiferus, or true British Pearl-mussel, is sufficiently well
known to naturalists, yet some obscurity has been thrown on the subject, and the repu-

tation of its beautiful pearls also suffered, from the circumstance that another very

sordid sort of pearl is procured from the salt-water mussel found at the mouth of the
Cor. way, the incjuirer commonly resting satisfied with such as are here procured and
offered him. With respect to these inferior pearls, undue mystery has been attached

to them and their use. It is true that several families exist by gathering the mussels

at low water, but it is not for the sake of the contained pearls, but as food for swine,

some being also used as baits, the pearls, which indeed are sold as curiosities, being

a secondary object. We doubt whether any method is known of making them orna-

mental. The true pearl mussel must be searched for a good many miles up the

river, and the writer found it plentiful about a mile above the ancient bridge of

Llanrwst, near the domain of Gwydir, where the water is beautifully clear, rapid,
and deep, and it may be had hence up to Bettws-y-Coed. It was probably from

the first spot that Sir Richard Wynne obtained the pearl which he presented to the
queen of Charles the Second. The writer procured a couple of pearls from one

mussel, one of which he considers by no means despicable, though inferior to

another which he saw in the possession of one of the village maidens. By means

of the coracles still used on this part of the river, the naturalists might procure

plenty of these handsome shells, and it may be, be fortunate enough to meet with a

pearl.

The banks of the Conway near its embouchure are singularly rich in maritime and

other plants, very interesting to a naturalist from an inland district of England.

On the rocks of the Great Ormshead, immediately over Llandudno, we picked

Cotoneaster chrysocoma, Veronica spicata, HypocJusris niaculata, an Orohanr.he (pro-

bably wi/nor), apparently springing from the ivy, and, in the neighbourhood, about a
score more plants nearly as rare. The madwort {Asperugo) is not to be had

without endangering the neck, but it grows at Llech, the extreme and exposed point

of the Great Ormshead peninsula. The Scropkularia verna is considered by some a

doubtful native ; we gathered it near Gloddaeth, where it is plentiful on one spot,

and have it also from Diganeury ; it can hardly have been introduced. Along the

rather dangerous path which goes along the face of the Great Ormshead from the

west,   a  variety  of plants  may  be  got,                                        as  the  Samphire  {Crithmum)                                      generally  rare in

WeWales.   here found the Cyclosloma elegans, Bulimus obscurus and aciitus, Zua

lubrica, Helix virgata and pulchella, with five or six other common species of Helix,
and three or four common Pupce and Clausilise.

On several places on the Llandudno mountain are large accumulations of shells,

specimens of which a geologist gave to the writer as crag fossils, and proofs of an

elevation of the rock in comparativtly recent times. They entirelv consist of the

limpet, mussel, and periwinkle, and are mixed with bones of the sheep or goat.

No doubt they are the debris of ancient inhabitants, who probably worked at the

Wemines.   obtained a rude stone hammer which was found in tlie mines, similar

to some found by Mr. Bateman in British barrows ; and on Pen Ddinas, hard by, we
noticed rows of the foundations of circular British dwellings. An intrepid female

oologist, living by the mines, furnishes eggs of the Guillemot, Puffin, Divers, and

two or three species of Gull.

In the drift at the entrance of the Conway, many minute shells abound, four or

live species of Rissoa, and some of Odostomia, Mangelia, Lacuna, and Chemnitzia :

on the Anglesea side of the Menai. The writer picked up also dead shells of Ernar-

the dredge, he got from Llandudno Bay Tuhularia indivisa, Bullea aperta, Ophiura

rosula, Beroe pileus. Medusa aurita, and a few other species of animals. The deep

cavernous inlets at the foot of the Ormshead, appear to abound in other Medusidse,
which however we cannot attempt to enumerate. In a little pool in the Bay we

captured two specimens of the beautiful little fish, the Argentine. The large

yellowish Doris was common in the crevices of the rocks, and we found it also at

Beaumaris. It appears to take the place of D. verrucosa, which we have commonly

Wefound on the Sussex coast.                                            picked living specimens of Sphenia Binghami, and,

amongst Radiata, Cribella oculata, of a very rich orange colour, Uraster violacea, and

Asterins papposa ; also Actinia mesemhryanthemum of distinct varieties or species, the
beautiful A. dianthus (finer, however, at Penmon), and Anthea cereus. Saxicava

ruyosa seems to take the place of the Pholades as a borer in the limestone, though

valves of P. Candida and crispata are to be found. The Cephalopoda generally seem

rare on  the coast of North  Wales                                          Sepia,  Loligo  vulgaris and media,    all   of which we

the summit of the rocks, the second is the most common species of the shores.

WePatella pellucida in all its forms is found on the Laminaria.                                                    got tvvo fresh

antiquus and islandicus. Bulla lignaria and the large Turriiella are not rare as

mere shells. The Natica moniliformis, as it is now termed, abounds alive in Car-

digan Bay, but smaller than on our southern coast. Pecten maximus and Donax

trunculus or anatinus are also often small. The different species of Venns seem to
abound in this sea, particularly if we extend our search to the Isle of Man, where

we found V. striatula and casina. Tapes aurea and fasciata, Artemis lincta, horealls

and exoleta, and Fenerupis pullastra, decussata and virginea, often containing the

animals. Solen ensis, Reliqua marginatus and legumen are also common and fine on

this coast ; and other not rare bivalves are Lutraria ellipiica, Scrobicularia piperita,

Mya truncata, Psammobia Ferroensis, Mactra solida, truncate, subtruncata, and

stultorum, the latter, however, often as cinerea ; also Pectunculus glycimeris in its

two principal varieties.

    Remarks on the Anatomy of the Brachiopoda. By Albany Hancock.

    Having been engaged for some time past in investigating the structure of the
Brachiopods, I propose laying before this meeting of the British Association the
results attained up to the present moment, especially on two or three points, to which

my attention has been more particularly directed, and on which there exists some
diversity of opinion among anatomists.

   So far back as 1852 I had dissected H'aldheimia Australis a.ndTerelratulina cajmt-
serpentis, and was struck by the peculiar appearance of the organs commonly deno-
minated hearts, which seemed very unlike any molluscan heart that I had ever seen.

On attentive examination, it became evident that they gave off no arteries as they

had been described to do ; and, moreover, that their apices, from which the arteries
were stated to pass, appeared to open externally. I was therefore, and for other

reasons, inclined to consider the so-called hearts oviducts.

   At the same time I examined, with considerable care, the alimentary tube, my
attention having been particularly drawn to this part by Mr. Woodward ; and failed

to demonstrate an anal outlet, though I was disposed to believe in the existence of
a minute anal puncture ; and thought that the refuse of digestion might make its
escape by the foramen of the pedicle. Howsoever this might be, it was quite obvious
that no anal aperture was situated in the pallial chamber as described by Professor
Owen. I also examined the muscular apparatus, and likewise the nervous system

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and the complicated structure of the mantle, I found, invited further investigation.

   Other and more urgent matters, however, at that time claimed my attention, and

all further inquiry into the structure of the Brachiopods was necessarily postponed.
The results at which I had arrived were, nevertheless, partially made known, and
have, to a considerable extent, been substantiated by the more recent investigations
of Mr. Huxley, who in 1854 published a very interesting paper on the anatomy of
the Brachiopoda in the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society.' In this paper the author
arrives at the conclusion, that in Waldheimia and Rhynchonella there is no anus at all,
but that the intestine terminates in a blind sac ; that the so-called hearts give off no
arteries, and that they possibly open externally. Mr. Huxley also describes, for the
first time, a system of ramified peripheral vessels, and two or three pyriform vesicles,
one of which is attached to the stomach, and is in connexion with a series of " ridges "
and "bands." Some of the "ridges " are stated to pass from the so-called hearts
to the genitalia ; and the whole apparatus is supposed to be a portion of the circula-

tory organs.

    It is then mainly in relation to these points, respecting the vascular and alimentary
systems, raised by Mr. Huxley and myself, that there is a difference of opinion.

Professor Owen maintaining the existence of an anal aperture situated in the paliial

chamber, and that the so-called hearts are true vascular centres propelling the blood
through arteries to the various organs. The opinion of this distinguished anatomist
demands the utmost deference ; and it is on no slight grounds that I have ventured
to dissent from it in this instance, doing so only after the most diligent examination
that it was possible to give to the subject, and when to doubt longer would have

been to disregard the evidence of my senses. The greatest caution was forced upon

me, not only by the respect due to authority, but likewise because analogy strongly-

favoured the views of the learned Professor respecting an anal aperture. And here
it must be stated that I should never have been able to enter upon this subject with
any chance of success, had I not had at my command an ample supply of specimens.
I have therefore to express my obligations to Dr. Gray, Mr. Huxley, Mr. Wood-
ward, Mr. Davidson, Mr. M'Andrew and Mr. A'der; as it is to the liberality ot
these gentlemen that I am indebted for the specimens used upon the present

occasion.

    First, with regard to the so-called hearts : these are two in number in the Tere-
bratulidfB ; they are composed of two portions, which have been denominated respect-
ively auricle and ventricle. The former portion is suspended by a membrane in
the visceral chamber, and resembles the mouth of a trumpet with the inner surface
laminated in a radiating manner. The other portion is tubular, arched and tapering,
and is imbedded in the thickness of the anterior wall of the visceral chamber, passing
diagonally through it. On reaching the surface, the apical extremity opens into the
pallial chamhtr. The whole organ may be looked upon as a tube, constricted a little

near the centre, with one extremity expanded and opening into the visceral chamber,
the other tapering and opening externally. These organs are placed one on each
side of the intestine, and the apertures by which they communicate with the pallial
chamber are situated near the junction of the two pallial lobes, one on either side of
the mouth.

    In JRhynchonella there are four of these organs, as first pointed out by Mr. Huxley,

all of which open externally. Two correspond in situation with those of the Tere-

bratulidx, the other two being placed at the sides of the liver a little above the for-
mer. Lingula is supplied with a pair of these so-called hearts, which do not-difFer

materially from those already described.
   The external apertures of these organs I have seen in every instance, and though

I have searched with the greatest care, have entirely failed to detect any arteries or
vessels, or anything that could be taken for such, passing from their apices to the

ovaries, or to any other part. When I first detected the external apertures I thought

they might possibly be ruptures of the tissue ; but further experience prohibits any
such notion. They are always placed symmetrically, and are of equal size, resem-
bling each other in form, and in every respect are similar, which would not be the

case were they formed accidentally.
    It is quite evident that these organs are not muscular centres ; some other func-

tion than that of propelling blood must be assigned to them. I was originally dis-
posed to look upon them as oviducts, and such I still believe them to be. It has,
however, been suggested to me by Mr. Huxley that they are possibly renal organs,
and that they may perhaps serve also as oviducts. This appears plausible enough,
and may probably turn out to be correct. Professor Owen supposes that the eggs
 escape by dehiscence of the pallial membrane. Such a theory might seem feasible
 in respect to those Brachiopods v^hich have the ovaries situated between the layers
 of that organ ; but in Lingula they are developed in the visceral chamber attached
 to membranes to which the pseudo-hearts are appended. Here then the ovaries
 and these peculiar organs are brought into intimate relationship with each other
 and it would appear more likely that the eggs should escape by this conduit than
 that they should have to find their way into the pallial sinuses and then escape by
 the rupture of the membranes. The walls of the conduit are of a glandular nature,
 and the lips of the internal aperture are spread out like the mouth of a funnel, as if
 for the very purpose of receiving the ova on their escape from the ovaries.

    The alimentary tube in the TerebratulidcB and Rhynchondlidce \Bvemz,rV&h\&{ovt\ie
 firmness of its walls, which never collapse, though the oesophagus is generally a little

 compressed. It is bent into the form of a siphon, the arch being turned towards
 the dorsal or imperforate valve : the oesophagus represents the short, the stomach
 and intestine the long arm. The gastric organ, though small, is distinctly marked

 it is irregularly oval, and suddenly contracting posteriorly gives origin to the intes-
 tine, which is short, and is suspended by a membrane in the midst of the visceral
 chamber. This portion of the alimentary tube passes downwards and terminates

  behind the adductor muscle, having a cardinal muscle on each side. In the Tere-

 braiulidcB it gradually tapers towards its extremity, which is rounded and imperforate.
 In Waldheimia Australis it abuts against the membrane circumscribing the visceral
 chamber, to which it is firmly attached. But in Waldheimia cranium and Terebra-

 iulina caput-serpeniis there is no such attachment, the rounded cmcal extremity ter-
 minating at some little distance from the neutral wall of the chamber. The intestine
 of Rhynchonella on reaching this point doubles upon itself, and then advancing a little
 ends in an enlarged rounded extremity, which inclines to the right, and projects freely
  into the centre of the visceral chamber. In this, as in the Terebratulida?, there is no
  anal outlet, the termination of the intestinal tube being csscal. This is perfectly
 obvious in Rhynchonella psittacea. I have nevertheless made every endeavour to find
 an anal perforation ; I have made numerous dissections under apoweiful doublet,
  have removed the part and examined it with the microscope ; I have filled the tube
  with fluid as the finger of a glove with air, and by pressure have attempted to force
  a passage ; I have tried injections ; but have equally, on all occasions, failed to
  discover an outlet ; and have only succeeded in demonstrating more and more clearly
 the ceecal nature of the terminal extremity of the alimentary tube. Therefore, how-

 ever it may be opposed to analogy, the fact must be recorded, there is no anal

  orifice in Waldheimia, Terebratulina and Rhynchonella.
--96 REPORT 1856.

The next point that claims attention, is that relating to the pyriform vesicles

described by Mr. Huxley, of which there are five in Waldheimia Justralist. In the

other species that I have examined they do not appear to be so numerous ; one,

however, is aUvaj's present. This is attached to the dorsal surface of the stomach
on the median line ; and I have satisfactorily ascertained that the " ridges " on the

alimentary tube mentioned by Mr. Hux'ey as connected with it are really vessels;

likewise that these vessels pass along the gastro-parietal and ilia-parietal bands of

that gentleman, and thus reaching the ovarian sinuses run along their inner wall

and become attached to the border of the membranous ridge which suspends the

ovaries. They then course along the entire length of these organs, however ramified,

forming the axis around which the ova are developed. Two other vessels are in

connexion with this system ; one, passing backwards from the tube that runs along

the ilia-parietal bands, goes apparently to the pedicle ; the other, which is larger than
the rest, extends along the middle line of the stomach at Ihe base of the membrane

which divides the liver, and which has been denominated mesentery, and enters the

vesicle in front. The other four vesicles are considerably smaller than that attached

to the stomach, the walls of which are muscular, and are appended to the ovarian

vessels as they enter these organs.

From the above facts it may be safely concluded that in this apparatus we see the

true vascular system of these animals ; and yet it must be allowed to be rather of

a peculiar character. The vesicle suspended from the stomach is undoubtedly the

heart, and the vessels passing from it backwards are as assuredly arteries. The

vessel which passes along the stomach and approaches the vesicle in front, is appa-

rently the channel by which the blood is returned from the aerating surface ; but I
have hitherto failed to ascertain by what path the blood reaches this channel. It

would not, however, be difficult to conjecture, were it not better to wait the result

of further investigation. The central organ of propulsion is here of a very simple

form,-- a mere vesicle scarcely higher in organic mechanism than the pulsating

vessel of the Ascidian ; there is no auricle, no pericardium. Its powers must neces-

sarily be feeble; hence probablythe additional vesicles appended to the ovarian arteries,

which are apparently accessory pulsating organs.

With respect to the muscular system, I now find that the accessory cardinals are

not always distinct from the cardinal muscles ; but that the two occasionally coalesce,
forming only one muscle. This is the case in Waldheimia cranium. It is also worthy

of remark, that the dorsal pedicle muscles are not invariably attached to the hinge

plate. In W. cranium and Ternbratulina caput -serpentis they have their origin in

the valve itself between the adductors, extending nearly as far forward as they do.

I have nothing very positive to communicate on the reproductive system ; it does

not, however, appear conclusive that the Brachiopods are dioecious ; but, on the

--contrary, I find that the so-called ovaries or testes in Waldheimia Australis are really

composed of two parts, one yellow and minutely granular, the other red and

formed of large vesicles. In some specimens the former portion was developed into

eggs ; but I have not yet observed spermatozoa in the red part, which is probably
the male secreting organ. This would appear to be likely from what I have observed

in Lingula. In this genus the ovary is developed within the visceral chamber, of a

yellow colour and on the inner surface of the dorsal and ventral walls of this
                                                                            ;

chamber there ramifies a red dentritic organ which is made up for the most part of

large vesicles like those of the red portion of the genitalia of Waklh^imia ; and in

this organ I have found what I believe to be spermatophora filled with spermatozoa.

Thus it would appear that Lingula is androjjynous ; and if so, it is probable that
the other Brachiopods may likewise have the sexes combined in the same individual.

I shall refrain on the present occasion from entering upon the nervous system,

which is beautifully developed, only remarking  that  it  requires further elucidation
                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

and in conclusion may express a hope that I shall be able, before terminating the

investigation on which I am now engaged, to clear up what still remains obscure in

the anatomy and physiology of these interesting animals, and that at no distant

period I shall be in a position to publish a detailed and illustrated account of these
matters. With a view to this I have already made numerous drawings.

Suggestions for ascertaining the Causes of Death in Birds and Animals.

              By W. E. C. NouRSE, F.R.Med. S; Chirur.S.

The Medical Indications of Poisoning. Uy William E.G. Nourse, /S'Mr<7^oM
   to the East and West Cowes Dispensary, and Felloio of the Royal Medical and

Chirurgical Society

  --The medical proofs of poisoning are to be sought for, 1. in the recognition of the
--physiological or vital effects of the poison ; and 2. in the detection of the poison by tests:

hy chemical tests, used in the test-tube, the subliming tube, or the blowpipe; by
mechanical tests, powerful microscopes being used for the identification of crystals';
a.ndhy vital tests, portions of the suspected matter being given to animals, applied

to living tissues, or tasted vi'ith the tongue.

   The testing of a poison thus seems in a fair way of being thoroughly understood
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

but the methods of its recognition by its physiological or vital effects demand a few

further remarks.

1. The author insists in an especial manner on the importance of recognizing the

earliest symptoms of the administration of a poison.

2. The recognition of the severer and fully developed symptoms of poisoniny requires

no new comment                                                                     yet we have seen                    that life has actually been allowed to pass away
                                                                                ;

without such recognition being made.

   3. In cases of recovery, it is important to note the manner in which the symptoms
  ass off, and to observe the sequelce of them, if any.

   4. The mode of dying, when death takes place, is very indicative. There may be

death from coma, death from suffocation, or death from exhaustion, either of vital
power or of the vital fluid, or both. It is necessary to remember which sort of death
each poison produces, both to aid in identifying the poison, and for purposes of treat-
ment.

   5. The first thing sought for in examination after death should invariably he, phy-
siological evidence as to the mode of dying. The contents of the cavities of the heart
ought therefore to be examined before any other part is touched. It seems surprising,
that in the very able and careful post-mortem exammations now made, this needful

attention to the order of proceedings should be overlooked yet W'e every day read
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

accounts of such investigations in cases of the highest importance, in which no

notice is taken of ths contents of the heart, or if they are examined, it is after other

parts have been looked into, and when the empty or full condition of these cavities

can no longer be ascertained, owing to the vessels having been cut across.

  A proper examination of the contents of the heart, which can only be done rightly

if done first, would show the immediate physiological state which caused death, and

which points directly, through a more or less rapid series of effects of which it forms

the closing one, to the poison which originated them.

Nor is it in cases of poisoning alone that this point should be attended to. It

should be done in all cases ; and should invariably form the first step in any post-

mortem examination. The uses and advantages of this proceeding will be obvious

to every medical man                                                                                    and  for  the  sake of  the  student, who  is generally called on
                                                                                                     ;

to assist or to be present, it ought to be especially insisted on.

6. The other effects of poisons discovered in examinations post-mortem, are well known,

and have always received due attention

    In fact, these, with the chemical detection of the poison, and the severer and fully
developed symptoms during life, are and have been generally relied on as the great
medical proofs of poisoning. They must continue to be so ; but it is also necessary that
the other points alluded to should not be ovei-looked, especially the earlier and pre-
monitory symptoms which indicate poisoning, and the information to be gathered
from inspection of the contents of the heart.

              Recent Researches on the Cause of the Fluidity of the Blood.

                          By B. W. Richardson, M.D.

   The point of Dr. Richardson's researches consisted in the discovery of the volatile
alkali, ammonia, as a constituent of the living blood, and its escape from blood
abstracted from the bodj'. The author related a long series of demonstrative expe-
riments, all proving not only that ammonia v^ras present in the blood, but that upon
its presence the solubility of the fibrine, and therefore the fluidity of blood, de-
pended. The peculiarity of this demonstration of the cause of the fluidity of the
blood is, that it explains the different hypotheses which have previously been oflFered
on this question, and shows how far these hypotheses have approached or fallen
short of the truth. In concluding his paper. Dr. Richardson pointed out that
ammonia, in combination with carbonic acid gas, is a constaat constituent of the air
expired in the breath. The presence of ammonia in the animal economy, and its
evolution in respiration, was of interest, in that it connected more closely the link that
exists between the animal and vegetable worlds. But the subject was of the greatest
importance in relation to the causes, the nature and the treatment of various diseases,

especially those of the fever class.

Experiments and Observations on the Development of Infusorial Animalcules.

   By J. Samuelson, Honorary Secretary to the Royal Institution {Literary

    Society), Hull.

The author mentioned that, in March last, he had traced in rain-water the growth

of an infusorial animalcule, called Glaucoma scintillans, from one of the so-called

Monads of Ehrenberg, and, aided by a diagram, pointed out its gradual development

explaining, at the same time, the action of the internal organs, such as those of

digestion, &c., and the differentiation in structure which takes place as the animal-

cule grows older. He stated that he had fed these invisible forms with vegetable

cake in the first instance, and under the microscope with indigo, so that the process

of digestion was rendered visible (the latter is a mode which has for some time been

adopted by microscopists). Another phase in the existence of the animalcule was

then described by the author, namely, the encysting process ; also, the subsequent

--appearance of numerous examples of Kerona, a form of a higher character than

Glaucoma, which the author believed to be the result of the process just named.

Having obtained this glance at the life of Glaucoma, Mr. Samuelson then tried (at

the suggestion, he said, of Mr. Robert Hunt) what eflFect the rays of the sun would

have when filtered through variously-coloured glasses in accelerating or retarding

animalcular life. For this purpose, he fitted up a box containing three compartments,

covered by a pane of blue, red, and yellow glass respectively ; and he found that whilst

under the blue and red glass infusorial forms were rapidly developed, under the yellow

hardly any signs of life were visible. He then transferred a portion of the infusion

from the yellow to the blue compartment, when the infusorial forms very shortly

made their appearance. After this he varied the experiment, employing distilled

water and finely-cut hay, when the same results were even more strikingly exhibited.

The temperature, he said, under the three compartments varied on the average about

three degrees, though frequently the variation was greater, the blue always being the

lowest. After mentioning one or two other circumstances connected with the expe-

riment, Mr. Samuelson concluded with a review of the results, and observed that if

they should be confirmed, that is, if the differently- coloured rays could be proved to

operate variously upon animal and vegetable life (to which he also adverted in the

course of his paper), much new light would be thrown on the debateable ground

between the two kingdoms.  ,

Description of the Ajuh, a hind of IJ^iale, found by Dr Vogel in the River

   The Ajuh is a species of whale found in the River Benue, or Upper Chadda, by

--Dr. Vogel, and is thus described by him : It is black, horizontal, shovel-shaped,

with two fins, situate close behind the head, each with three three-jointed bones.

narily small (in one individual, of 5 feet in length, the head was 18 inches long, 15

inches high, and the orifice of the mouth only 3 inches) ; nostrils directed forward

--and close over the upper lip they are crescentic ; eyes upward directed, close

behind the nostrils, and (in the above mentioned case only 3^ inches from the end

of the muzzle or snout) very small (3 lines in diameter), black ; no spouting-holes

gullet hard ; tongue immoveable (grown fast) on each side, above and below ; five

grinders (with six points and three roots each), extending only a few lines above the

gum                                front    teeth    wanting,      instead  of  which                                                             the jaw                         is     bordered  with hard,    short

red hairs. The Ajuh becomes 10 feet long, and lives in the marshes inundated by

the river. With the subsidence of the waters, the animal retires down the river to

the ocean ; but reappears in the commencement of the rainy season with the rising

waters, bringing with it one or two young, at that period from 3 feet to 4 feet in

length. Its food consists chiefly of grass ; and in the dung, which in colour and

form resembles that of the horse, no trace of fish was ever found. The Ajuh is

exceedingly fat; the flesh and fat, similar to that of the hog, is very well-tasting.

The bones are as hard as ivory, and rings are fabricated from them, and whips are

made from the skin.                                        The  Ajuh  appears   to  be                                                            rare                       and      I  do  not  believe  that  during

the three months it remains in the Benue more than twenty to thirty are taken.

On this paper. Prof. Owen read the following Note on the Ajuh of Dr. Vogel.

The translation of Dr.Vogel's account of the animal which that enterprising traveller

had seen in the river Benue or Chadda, in Central Africa, permits of no doubt being

entertained as to the class, and even genus, of animal to which that brief and some-

what vague account refers. The combination of two crescentic nostrils, with a

pair of fins attached "close behind the head," shows that it is a cetaceous animal;

whilst its food, "chiefly of grass," proves it to belong to the herbivorous section of

the order Cetacea of the Cuvierian system, answering to the order Sirenia of Illiger.

That order now includes three genera, Manatus, Halicore, and Rytina; the first of

which is the only one in which the teeth are multicuspid and with two or more

roots. It is therefore a species of Manatee that Dr. Vogel makes known to us
under the name of Ajuh. One species of Manatus has long been known as inhabit-

ing certain rivers of Africa, especially those terminating on the west coast. This

Aspecies is the Manatus Senegalensis of Cuvier and other zoologists. stuffed specimen

from that coast is in the British Museum ; it was presented by Messrs. Vorster and Co.,

African merchants. The back and sides of the body are of a very dark gray, approach-

ing to black ; the belly is a Hghtgray. The head is small in proportion to the body,

and tapers to an obtuse muzzle ; the upper lip is cleft, and the mouth small. The

nostrils, a pair of crescentic clefts, with the convexity upward and backward, are
situated as described in the Ajuh : the eyes are, however, not situated close behind

the nostrils, and they are distant 7^ inches from the end of the muzzle. This
admeasurement is from an individual about 3 feet longer than the one of which the
dimensions are given by Dr. Vogel ; but the difference of relative position seems still

too great to be accidental or probable in animals of the same species. The hard short
bristles which fringe the mouth, the scattered hairs along the back, the nails termina-

ting each of the three-jointed digits of the pectoral fin, the want of front or incisive teeth,

the hard ivory-like texture of the bones, the fatness and vapid nature of the flesh,

are all characters common to the Manatees. The number of nails appears to vary
in individuals of the same species, as might be expected in parts almost rudimental

in their development, and of no very great utility to the animal. Thus Cuvier

notices in one individual of the American Manatee {Manatus Americanus, Desm.,
M. Amlralis, TiJesius) four flat rounded nails on the edge of the fin ; the fourth

being very small. In a foetus of this species there were but three nails on one fin,

and four on the other. In a young Manatee, Cuvier noticed only two nails on each

fin*. The three nails observed by Dr. Vogel on the fin of the Ajuh, cannot, there-

fore, be depended on as a constant or specific character. The teeth of the known

--species of Manatee have the crown divided into two transverse ridges, each ridge,

bordered bj' enamel, is exposed. There is also an anterior and posterior low barrel

ridge ; the posterior one being most developed in the lower molars. The upper

molars have each three diverging roots, one on the inner and two on the outer side.

The lower molars have two fangs. Dr. Vogel's description of the grinders, as
"having six points and three roots each," would apply to the upper molars of the
M. Senegalensis before they had been much worn*. As to the number " five," that

doubtless refers to the number forming tlie series of teeth on each side of the jaw.
I have not had the opportunity of examining the dentition of the known African
Manatee. In the figure of the skull of the M. Senegalensis given by Cuvierf, six

molars are shown on the right side of both upper and lower jaws, and the coronoid
process of the mandible may hide a greater number. In the American Manatee I

have ascertained that at least nine molars are developed on each side of both jaws X,
but they are never simultaneously in place or use. The greatest number which I

have found in that condition is seven, the socket of a shed anterior molar being at

one end of the series, and that containing an incomplete ninth molar at the opposite

end. Prof. Stannius has observed a small simple conical molar anterior to the nor-

mal two-ridged molars, and divided by a narrow interval from them, in a new-born

American Manatee. The individual Ajuh, 5 feet in length, which appears to have

been more especially the subject of Dr. Vogel's account, was a half-grown animal,

and the number of grinders (five), as well as their six-pointed crowns, doubtless

relate to that circumstance. Fifteen feet is said to be the length to which adults of

the M. Senegalensis attain: the Ajuh becomes 10 feet long. It maybe a distinct
and somewhat smaller species. The chief indication, however, of such specific di-

stinction is the closer approximation of the eyes to the nostrils and to the end of the
snout, as shown by the admeasurement given by Dr. Vogel. The easiest procura-

ble and transportable evidence of the Ajuh, and the best calculated to determine

this  point  would  be  the  skull  ;  but  every  part  would be  most acceptable                                                                          and,  in  the

meanwhile, the species may be indicated and kept before the notice of the naturalists

by entering the Ajuh in the Zoological Catalogue as the Manatus Vogelii, or Vogel's

Manatee.

Experimental Researches on the Eye, and Observations on the Circulation of

    the Blood in the Vessels of the Conjunctiva, of the Iris, of the Ciliary
   Ligament, mid of the Choroid Membrane, during life, as seen under the Com-

   pound Microscope. By Augustus Waller, M.D., F.R.S.

   Dr. A. Waller states, that his observations are founded in great measure on the

fact observed by him some months since, that the eye may be obtained sufficiently-

protruded from the cavity of the orbit to render its deep-seated parts accessible to

direct observation.

   Artificial exophthalmosis of this nature, he finds from experiment, may be easily

produced in various animals, sufficiently to expose the anterior two-thirds of the
eyeball and to observe the circulation oyer the greatest portion of the vessels of the

choroid.

   While in this state the iris may be made to contract by light, and there is reason

to suppose that the organ of the animal still possesses the powers of vision.
   The eye is obtained in this state by opening widely the eyelids, and by exercising

a slight lateral pressure on the eye, which causes the ej^eball to escape through the
opening of the eyelids ; returning to its original situation as soon as the pressure is

removed.

   For his experiments. Dr. Waller employs the rabbit, the guinea-pig, and the Mus de-
cumanus or rat, all of them of the albinos variety, and more especially the albinos rat.

    In these animals, by means of the light passing through the pupil and through the
sclerotica, the organ may be sufficiently illuminated by transmitted light to enable
us to observe, under the compound microscope, the different parts of the eye as a

transparent object.

   The body and the eye of the animal are fixed by using a roll of linen like a swad-
dling band, and then tied to a piece of flat cork, the eye at the same time being pro-

truded from the orbit by a few turns of thread passed alternately behind and in front
of the eyeball in close contact with it.

   The result is, that the animal's eye is kept nearly immoveable, and that by direct-
ing the microscope to any point of the exposed surface, the circulation of the vessels
may be easily examined under a magnifying power of 200 diameters and upwards.

   Dr. Waller then proceeds to describe minutely the different parts of the eye, and
the distribution of the vessels over the cornea, the sclerotica,' the iris, and other deep-
seated parts of the eye.

            On the Mechanism of Respiration in the Family of Echinida.
                               By Thomas Williams, M.D.

    The author stated, that, after a very careful research upon the subject, he had

arrived at the conclusion that the mechanism of the breathing process in the Echi-

nidse dilFered in a radical manner from that which obtained in the Asteridie. In
the latter, the entire integumentary skeleton was perforated by minute orifices,
through which digital, membranous, ccecal processes protruded, and in and by
which the cavitary fluid was brought into contact with the exterior aerating
element. In the Echinidee, on the contrary-, the integumentary skeleton was
perforated only by the " ambulacral feet." ' The branchise in this family were
restricted to the membranous area which surrounded the mouth, around the
circumference of which they are disposed in a row. They differed in number and

structure in different orders, but in all they conformed to one type. They were
hollow-branched membranous processes, considerably larger in size than the
corresponding processes rising from the ligamentary surface of Jsterias ; and
communicated directly with the general cavity of the body. They bore an inti-
mate resemblance to the branchiae of the SipimculidcB. TheEchinidae differed from

the Sipunculidce in being totally destitute of every provision along the general sur-
face of the body which could aid in the office of respiration. The relation which

was thus established between the branchiae and the cavitary fluid in the Echinidw,
was a strong presumptive ground for the belief that a blood-vascular system did
not exist at all in this family of Echinoderms.

On the Fluid System of the Nematoid Entozoa. By Thomas Williams, M.D.

  --In this communication the author mentioned the leading facts: 1. That espe-

cially in the genus Ascaris the peritoneal cavity was occupied by a peculiar vesicular

tissue, opening on the integumentary exterior, which appeared to be adapted to
absorb fluid from without. 2. That in some species it almost entirely filled up that
space which in the Annelids was/ree, and occupied by an oscillatory fluid; and, 3.
That in the Nematoid Entozoa there did not exist any trace whatever either of a
blood-vascular or a water-vascular system.

      On the Variation of Species. By the Rev. L. Jenyns, M.A., F.L.S.

   The object of this paper was to draw the attention of the Natural History Section
of the British Association to the importance of collecting all the facts already known,
or which might be obtained by further researches, connected with the variation of
species. The subject was stated to be one, which, more than almost any other,
deserved the consideration of naturalists at the present day. Reference was made to
the many complaints which may be found in the works of different authors, as to the
difficulty of determining what is and what is not a species, as also to the excessive
multiplication of species by some naturalists, and their too ready disposition to over-
rate the value of those slight differences, by which many of these so-called species are
distinguished. It was thought that a very large number would probably prove to
be merely local races, originally derived from one stock, their differential characters
102 REPORT 1856,

being due to climatal or other external causes exercising a permanent influence through
a succession of generations. Hence it was recommended, in the case of such species
as have others closely allied to them but supposed to be probably distinct, to endeavour

to trace the effect of such causes. Many facts bearing on this question were thought

to be already on record, only scattered over various works and periodicals, which

required to be collected under one head; while a far larger number were wanted in
order to arrive at any certain conclusions admitting of such generalization. These
last must principally be sought for at the hands of travellers or naturalists stationed

in different parts of the world, whose comparative observations on the same species,
as found in diflferent regions and latitudes, would prove of great value.

   In this communication the author restricted his remarks for the most part to the

species adopted in zoology. It was urged especially that we should endeavour to
work out the history of those exotic animals which either appear identical with, or
which closely approximate to, European forms, and observe whether, between two

nearly allied species inhabiting remote countries, there cannot be discovered inter-

mediate forms, or as they have been termed transition species, serving to show the
passage from one species to another, and so proving all to be the same. Or, if such
cannot be detected in any of the intervening parts of the globe, inquiry should be
made whether the exotic form is never found in any transition state in the particular
country it inhabits. It was remarked that it does not follow, because the European

race never acquires the distinguishing character of the exotic form, that the latter

may never so vary as to become identical with the former.

   But it was added, that before we can hope to clear up the doubts which hang over
a large number of exotic species, we must be better acquainted with the European

species themselves to serve as a standard of comparison with all others. Even in the

case of some of our most common birds, and the same is true in every other class of

animals, there are several different races, or sub-species as some call them, or real

species as accounted by others, inhabiting either the same or different countries on

the continent, each showing some shght though constant peculiarity of character,

but on the whole so generally similar, that we are at a loss, in the present state of

our knowledge, whether to refer them to one or more than one original stock. It
was thought that the endeavour to remove some of the difficulties which attend this

question would prove more serviceable to zoology than adding to our already over-

loaded lists of names, one-half of which would probably in the end sink to mere

Wesynomyms, increasing the confusion.  alone advance the philosophy of the

science, when we are not content with registering a new species, or subdividing an

old one ; but when we seek to ascertain the origin and nature of species themselves,

their geographical range, the influence they receive from the particular circumstances

--under which they live, the limits within which they may vary, without having their

essential diflferences destroyed, and the degree of permanence stamped upon some

of these variations, through the slow operation of local and climatal causes over a

long period of time.

The author, in allusion to the doubts entertained by some with respect to species

in general, stated his opinion that there was nothing to contradict the belief

that they had a real existence in nature, and that all the individuals belonging to

the same species had emanated from a single stock, or in other words, that there

had been for each species but one centre of creation. He considered that the case

of hybrids, so far from proving anything to the contrary, only demonstrated the

reality of species the more plainly ; for he believed that strictly hybrid plants had
never been known to reproduce themselves beyond two or three generations at most,

while there were not more than one or two well-authenticated instances of hybrid

animals producing offspring at all, excepting with one of the parent species, to which

in this way, the hybrid, making continually a nearer approach, was gradually brought

back. He regarded this as a clear indication on the part of nature that there is a

barrier separating certain forms, or collections of forms, from certain others, which

shall not be ordinarily passed, and never passed, without those who pass it, being,

so to speak, sent back in the end. Unless we ground our notions of the species on

this law, we in vain attempt a definition of it at all. If we once hold that species can

intermix through an unlimited succession of generations, since no species under such

circumstances could preserve its distinguishing characters for any length of time,

it is equivalent to saying that species have no existence at all.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  103

   He thought it probable that a great deal of the obscurity in which this subject

is involved arose from our inadequate ideas with respect to the degree to which cer-
tain species may vary, without losing their identity, and the unwillingness of some
naturalists who have been long accustomed to other ways of thinking, to receive the

facts as conclusive, which have been adduced in support of this opinion. He then

adverted to certain facts and observations which had been brought forward of late
years by different naturalists to show the variation to which many species are liable
in the classes of Insects, Birds, and Shells. Several conclusions arrived at by Mr.
Wollaston*, in reference more especially to the coleopterous insects of the island of
Madeira, were much dwelt upon. Variations of structure, size and colouring had

been found by that gentleman to be often connected with the insular or continental
stations in which these insects lived, the temperature of the climate, the altitudes at
which they were found, and their greater or less proximity to the sea.

    In the class of Birds, a few cases were alluded to in which the adult males of cer-
tain species in certain countries appeared never to arrive at the same state of plumage

which characterized the very old male in others : also the instance of the common
Ruff {Machetes pugnax) , which, according to Mr. Blythef, is never met with in the

neighbourhood of Calcutta in the breeding plumage, by which it is so remarkably
distinguished in Europe. Mention was then made of several common European
birds, of which two or more races existed in different parts of the continent, each
characterized by certain constant peculiarities of plumage, and which it was very
desirable should be studied more closely, especially in respect of habits and manner
of life, by those who had the opportunity, in order to ascertain whether they have
any real claim to be elevated to the rank of species, the light in which they have

--been considered by some naturalists : such, for example, as the Sylvia suecica of

Latham, of which one race exists in the north of Europe having the pectoral spot
rufous, and another in the central and south parts having the same spot white ; the
Saxicola aurita, and the S. stapazina, found, at least in the greatest plenty, in the
north and south parts of Italy respectively, and only to be distinguished by the
colour of the throat ; the Common, Cisalpine, and Spanish Sparrows, the differences
between which, and those very slight, were almost confined to the adult males ; the

many so-called species of White and Yellow Wagtails, mostly inhabiting different
parts of Europe, though occurring, some of them, together in some places. It was
observed, in reference to these and similar cases, that if two closely-allied species

are found living together always, without any individuals occurring of an intermediate
kind, it is a strong argument for their being really distinct. But if they are mostly
found in two different countries or districts, the same inference cannot be drawn from
the circumstance of their being occasionally met with together in the localities lying
between those two countries, or bordering on them when contiguous.

    In the above-mentioned instances, the differences between the supposed species
rest principally in the plumage j but the author went on to speak of others, in which
these are combined with slight differences of foim or size of parts, but on which it

was shown, from many recorded observations, no greater reliance could be placed,
as a ground at least in all cases, of specific distinctness. The differences between
the White-winged Cross-bills of America and Europe, as indicated by De Selys-
Longchamps+, were adduced as a probable example of this kind of variation. That
naturalist observes that these two Cross-bills (which have been considered by some
naturalists as two species to which the names of Loueia leucoptera and L. bifasciata

have been respectively given) differ slightly, but constantly, in size, form of the bill,

depth of the red tint of the plumage, and proportions of the wings and tail. He

--thinks, nevertheless, that these are only the distinguishing marks of two races, sprung

originally from the same stock, one race having fixed itself in the North of America,

the other in the North of Asia. He suggests, in explanation of the modified form of

the bill in the two kinds, that, in birds which use the bill as pinchers for detaching
the seeds of fir-cones, and tearing them violently away, the shape of this organ may
to a certain extent be affected by the different forms of fructification in the different

species of conifers. And he is strengthened in this opinion by the circumstance that
the second American species of Cross-bill {Loxia Ampricana, Wils.) resembles on

the whole the L. curvirostra of the Old World, but differs from it, exactly in the
same way as the h. leucoptera differs from L. bifasciata, that is to say, by its smaller
size, and weaker bill with the points finer and more elongated.

    Reference was also made to a remark by Mr. Gould respecting the swallows and
sylvan birds in the island of Malta, whicb, " though unquestionably of the same

species as those of Great Britain, exhibit small local characteristics by which they

may be immediately distinguished, such as the length of the wings, size of the bills,
and tints of the plumage*." Mr. Gould was inclined to think that the shortening
of the wings in these Maltese individuals was connected with the circumstance of

their having a shorter distance to traverse in their migrations to and from Africa,

where they winter.

  --These and several other observations, all tending to show the occasional variation

of the characters of birds, more especially some by the same gentleman last alluded

to respecting the greater brilliancy of the plumage, according as individuals of a

--given species were found in the interior of continents, or in insular or maritime

countries t, led the author to ask, whether there is not enough on record to make us
at least hesitate respecting the stability, not of species in general, but of many of the

so-called species of Birds. When we couple the facts above referred to, with the
known influences of season and temperature in causing periudic changes in the

--plumage of some species; when we find these changes hastened or retarded

according as the seasons are more or less forward, prevented, it is probable, from
taking place at all some years> or in some localities, in which the summers are colder

--or the winters milder than in others ; when we further take into consideration the

known effect which particular kinds of food have in altering the plumage of birds in

--captivity, the colours becoming deeper or more dull, sometimes changing to a complete

blackj ; when we bear all this in mind, and recollect too how generally the offspring

--is marked with the peculiarities of the parents, might we not almost Ф p-Фon be led

to expect, that if a species had originally extended itself ages back, or been accidentally

introduced into other countries than that in which it had been first created, these
countries having a different climate, or the bird finding there a particular food, cal-

--culated to exercise a permaimtt influence of a like kind to that which is only seasonal

ov occasional elsewhere, it would become, in the course of generations, stamped by
some permanent variation of plumage, just as we have the different races of men,
each bearing so remarkably its own distinctive characters, yet surely all of one species,

as the best ethnographers and physiologists of the day seem disposed to admit ?

   An opinion was expressed, that where two species are really distinct, there will

generally be some difference of song, nidification, or other habits, accompanying any

slight differences of plumage, as in the instance of Sylvia trochibis and -S. rvfa, which
no one would mistake when heard in the woods, though difficult to distinguish in
hand. And though we must for a long time be necessarily ignorant of the habits
of a large number of foreign birds, the author thought it far better, in the case of any
supposed new species, especially where only one or two specimens have been obtained,
to abstain from naming it for the present, unless characterized by well-marked and
unmistakeable peculiarities of form or plumage, rather than incur the risk of increasing

the synonyms of some previously known species, from which it may not prove to be

distinct. Until further information respecting it were obtained, it would be prefer-
able to regard it as a mere local race, to which race, however, there would be no
objection to append the name of the particular country or district in which it was
found.

   Before concludmg. the author made some remarks on the variation of shells,
noticing chiefly some valuable communications to science by Dr. GrayД and Mr.
M'Andrew||, who have shown that the characters of many species of shells greatly
alter, according to the depth of sea they inhabit, or the more or less exposed situations
in which they are found. He then expressed a hope that these variations, along with

the others he had spoken of in the species of different classes of animals, would
receive more attention from naturalists in future, as tending to throw light upon a
question which is every day assuming more importance, and on the solution of which
all correct notions of classification must be based.

   Let a map constructed about the commencement of the present century be exa-
mined, and attention will be at once arrested by the immense tracts of country marked
unexplored ; and even in other directions names are but sparingly given, and the
positions of cities and the courses of rivers marked only by guess. The famous city

the mighty Niger, or Kwora, historical ever since the days of Herodotus, was inserted
without beginning and without termination, save when some bold theoretical charto-
grapher connected it with Gambia, or led it to the Nile or the Congo. Even the
numerous streams which enter the Bights of Benin andBiafra were unknown except
as breaks in the coast line, which were never visited but by slaves or pirates. The
tide of more modern discovery may be held to have commenced with the travels of
Bruce in Abyssinia, when he discovered the sources of the Blue Nile, and in more
central Africa, with the first expedition of the celebrated Mungo Park, when he deter-
mined the easterly course of the Niger. Many other adventurers, as Houghton, Horne-
mann, Nicholls, &c., followed, and added little by little to our previous scanty know-
ledge. But by far the most important facts were collected by Denham and Clappei'-
ton, who re-discovered Bornu, identified Lake Tsad, visited Bagirmi, Mandara, and
other unknown districts, and brought circumstantial accounts of a wonderful, do-
minant race, the Pulo or Fulata tribes. About the same time Timbuktu had been
reached, first by the unfortunate Major Laing, and shortly afterwards by M. de
Caillie, whose narrative was the first authentic one relating to that wondrous city.
The next important journey was that of the brothers Richard and John Lander, who,
having penetrated from Badagry, on the coast, to the town of Yauri, descended the
river in a canoe, and at the expense of great hardship and danger, discovered its
embouchure, and so settled a controversy which had commenced long before the
Christian era. This exploit of the Landers caused the beginning of a new series of
efforts, and thenceforth attention was especially directed to a water communication
with Sudan. The first of these was by Mr. Macgregor Laird, Capt. Allen, and Mr.
Oldfield ; the second by the late Mr. Consul Beecroft ; and, finally, one undertaken
by the Government, and which left this countiy in 1841. All of these showed
clearly that the Niger was easily navigable, the only difiBculty being from the effects
of the climate, which proved so fatal to European life, that Mr. Laird lost 44 out of
49, and the Government Expedition in less than two months experienced a mortality

--of 49 out of 145 whites, a result which shook the confidence and deadened

the energy of the most ardent philanthropists. In 1845 and 1846 Mr. J. Richardson
travelled from Tripoli to the northern parts of the Great Desert, visiting Ghadaraes,
Tuat, and Murziik, during which time he collected much information, both geo-

graphical and commercial, which may be found in his interesting volumes entitled
' Travels in the Great Desert of Sahara.' On this gentleman's return to England he
made proposals to Government for an expedition on a more extended scale, for the

purpose of establishing commercial relations with the tribes across the Desert, and,
by the introduction of legitimate trade, of striking a blow at slavery. Accordingly,

he again set forth accompanied by Drs. Barth and Overweg, who started from
Tripoli for Sudan on the 30th of March, 1849. Mr. Richardson's strength was not
equal to the great fatigue and labour he had to undergo, and he died at Ungurutua,

in Bornu, on the 4th of March, 1851. His journal up to that date, full of instruct-
ive materials, has since been published under the care of Mr. Bayie St. John. His

bly of tougher materials, undismayed by the death of his associates, boldly continued
his solitary wanderings, and after a sojourn in Central Africa of upwards of five

years, happily returned in safety to England. He is now preparing for the press
an account of his most interesting journeys and discoveries ; and from some conver-
sations and correspondence I have had with him, I am looking forward with impatience

for the appearance of his work, as with such a fund of information and of novelties
as he possesses, he must be able to give the fullest and most accurate, as well as the
latest, account of Central Africa, from Timbuktu to Adamawa. The most recent
traveller in Nigritia is Dr. Vogel, who, bj' the last letters received from him, was
endeavouring to penetrate towards the kingdom of Wadai, and from whona numerous
important astronomical and other observations have been already transmitted.

   In 1852, Dr. Barth, whilst on the route to Yola, the capital of Adamawa, crossed

a large river called the Binue, just at its junction with a considerable affluent, the
Faro. This river he conjectured, from the information he received, to be the upper

portion of that hitherto known near its termination, to Europeans, as the Tsadda or

--Tshadda, a name which seems to have been given to it by Lander, in consequence
--of a report he heard from a travelling Mallam, that it flowed from lake Tsad,

view now proved to be erroneous. Dr. Barth described this as a large river, and as

--containing during the rainy season a large body of water, fitted, therefore, for the

purposes of navigation. On hearing these accounts from Dr. Barth, Government

resolved to fit out a small expedition, to endeavour to ascend the so-called Tsadda,
and to ascertain its identity with the Binue. For this purpose a small iron screw
schooner was built by Mr. John Laird at Birkenhead, and fitted out and manned by
Mr. Macgregor Laird ; and as it had been agreed to combine the commercial element
with exploration, a suitable cargo was also provided. Government appointed certain
officers to proceed in this vessel for geographical, scientific, and other general
purposes. Careful and copious instructions were drawn out under the direction of
 Sir Francis Beaufort, aided more especially by the scientific knowledge of Sir

Roderick Murchison, who took an especial interest in the progress of the expedition,
was one of its chief promoters, and who himself personally prepared a set of hints
on geologj' and mineralogy for the guidance of the officers. This expedition entered
the mouth of the Kwora or Niger on the 1 2th of July, 1854 ; and after remaining in

 the river 120 days, again left without the loss of a single life, and without having
encountered any troublesome sickness. This almost unlooked-for exemption is to
be ascribed, first, to the employment of as few Europeans as possible ; secondly, to
 ascending the river during the rainy season, and avoiding any delay in the Delta
 and, thirdly, to the free use of quinine as a prophylactic or preventive. Nearly 700
 miles of river were explored and surveyed, a chart was compiled, the capabilities of
the surrounding countries examined, and friendly relations were established with the
 various tribes.

    The trade with Western Africa is much greater than is generally supposed, and
 has for some years past been steadily on the increase. From 1846 to 1850, the
 annual value of exports from Britain to the West Coast averaged ^554,000, and in
 1854 amounted to upwards of j^958,000. The African races are, almost without

exception, born traders, buying and selling being with them the chief end of their

lives. Only give them the chance, and they will eagerly grasp at it ; and being

also naturally friendly and well-disposed, they only require kind treatment to render

them confiding and quiet. The only well-marked exceptions are among the natives
living along the coasts, who have contracted from Europeans all possible vices,

which have been unfortunately encouraged for selfish ends by white men, until
now; the present generation, at least, is almost beyond the reach of reform. In
the interior the population is much better conducted, and it is with these people
that I now propose to open trade directly, by means of the rivers, instead of through

the medium of the many savage races with whom we now deal. This would, more-

over, open to us vastly increased supplies, which could also be purchased at more
moderate rates. By opening new markets also with these people, they would have

other things to occupy them instead of intestine wars, and above all it would tend

directly to supplant by means of legitimate commerce that still existing unnatural
and horrid traffic in human flesh, which, first established and since fostered by men

styling themselves Christians, has been the bane and the curse of Africa, but which

I feel assured, from what I have observed, as well as from the experience of other

recent travellers, would be greatly lessened, and in time altogether stopped, by the

means I now recommend.
   The population of Sierra Leone is composed, to a very great extent, of recaptured

and freed slaves and their families, and among them are to be found representatives

of almost every tribe in Central Africa. These people have become civilized, are

Christians, speak the English language, have acquired English manners, and learnt

our methods of trading ; they are usually most industrious, and many have acquired
wealth. Still, among them an intense love of country exists, and the all but uni-

versal desire is to revisit their native land. One very extensive race, the Yoruba or

Akii tribe, have already returned to their original seats in great numbers, their

country having a sea-coast, and access being easily attained by Lagos and Badagry.

But others are not so fortunate, and have not the opportunities of gratifying their
amor patrice. But in these persons we have at hand all that we desire, ready in-

struments to be employed alike in establishing commerce, and in civilizing, by their

own efforts, their less favoured brethren. By opening to these the navigation

of the Niger, and aiding them to settle along its banks, we do good alike to them,

to the country, and to ourselves; and I have satisfied myself, by actual inquiry, both

that these people would eagerly embrace any opening for return, and likewise that

they would be received with open arms. Such are the commercial and philanthropical

grounds for advocating further progress ; but there are equally strong scientific reasons

for prosecuting the inquiry. Numerous tribes are yet unknown, many countries

unexplored, cities and towns unvisited, lakes and rivers unsurveyed, and mountains

unmeasured. The zoological and botanical novelties are unaccountable, the geologic

condition and mineral treasures have yet to be examined, and the economical products

carefully inquired into. The climate is not so deadly as has been supposed, and the

hitherto dreaded diseases are more thoroughly understood. The expense, too, of

--exploration, especially if combined with commercial enterprise, would be very

trifling, not one-twentieth part of what was lavished on the unfortunate attempt in

1841. If the expedition is to be renewed, no time should be lost ; as if not at once

undertaken, all that has been effected in 1854 will be thrown away, and efforts

would have to be commenced de novo. During my ascent of the river, I was often

asked why white men had been so long in revisiting the place, and why they had

Mynot sooner kept the promises they made in 1841.  ingenuity was often taxed to

afford explanations and excuses, and the chiefs said that when they saw us returning

regularly they would then believe white men, but not before. Two years have

already elapsed since my visit ; and it would be of the utmost consequence that

preparations should be now made for the season 1857, for which purpose Govern-

ment should be urged to come to a decision, so as to enable the requisite arrange-

ments to be at once entered upon, as those engaged should leave England early in

the spring.

Notes on some Antiques found at Cirencester as Evidence of the Domestic
                   Manners of the Romans. By Professor Buckman.

    la this communication the evidence derived from the position of most of the

Roman stations went to show that this people was guided by a careful survey of

the district, as they fixed some important stations, and Corinium amongst others,
at a distance from the direct road, making an abrupt turn in accordance with the
geological facts which presented themselves; and as for some miles round the
country does not offer water supply for a large community, but this is ensured at
Cirencester by a curious concatenation of geological conditions. The esteem in
which this people held a good water supply, is attested by the remains of most care-
fully executed wells still remaining, and indeed some of those now in use, all lined
with fine ashlared stone, the rubbish which has been cleared from the bottom of
some of them presenting traces of the well-moulded coping stones by which they
were surmounted.

    In metallurgy it was pointed out that they greatly excelled ; and two most inter-
esting crucibles were exhibited, in order to show that the chemical apparatus so
named is of very ancient date.

    In metallic work some beautiful bronze personal ornaments were exhibited, espe-
cially some armillse or bracelets, six of which were staled as having been taken
from a single arm ; and as these possessed rivets, it was suggested that they were
never removed from the person ; if, therefore, these were lovers' gifts, it showed
either that the lover was very lavish or that a gift was not returnable.

   An oyster-knife was shown, as also some fictilia for domestic use, as a funnel,
colander, infants' feeding-bottle, their form and application so much like our own as

to lead to the inference that comfort and convenience were sought in furniture which
we have very exactly copied. Amongst other articles, bone-spoons, like those used
in country places, were shown to be so perfect, as to lead to the inference that they
could scarcely be antique ; however, on comparing them with our present forms, it

was observed that the handles were pointed, a custom with all spoons of Roman

work, whether in bone or metal ; it is stated that this was for the piercing of egg-
shells, so that they should not swim, the legend that uncanny visitors niay swim in
egg-shells, being, like many articles of modern use, not a modern invention.

    In concluding his remarks upon the various relics which he had collected at
Cirencester, the Professor remarked that these were not sought often by the anti-
quary merely as curious property, but because their study was so well calculated to
fill up those blanks in history which acquaint us with the inner life of the people,
instead of confining it to a mere account of the battles, murders and sudden death
of potentates and rulers.

                         By J. Barnard Davis, F.S.A., F.E.S.

    The typical form of the Anglo-Saxon skull is distinguished for its great size, the
horizontal development of the brain-case being somewhat expanded in all directions
at its periphery, without being deficient in height ; by which means is produced a -weW-
maiked plaiy-cephalic skull. The calvarium, when viewed vertically, does not impress

the eye with its unusual length or shortness, although it is not at all deficient in
length ; but it appears somewhat broader than common. The frontal region is fre-
quently upright, so as to afford a good Camperian angle, broad and expanded at the

sides, in this respect greatly resembling what we regard as the typical Roman form.
The lateral regions are full, and sometimes project over the base of the skull. The
posterior region is usually capacious and elevated. The outer surface of the vault of

the calvarium, which is full, equable, and expanded, gives the impression of great
capacity, and of constituting the receptacle of a massive powerful brain. The face
is upright, and only occasionally presents any marked prominence in the region of
the frontal sinuses. The nasal bones differ a good deal in form, are seldom large,
and only very rarely aquiline. The face is somewhat broad ; but from the angles of
the lower jaw not being so much expressed, does not present the quadrate form of

the ancient Roman.

   Mean internal capacity of these six crania, 99 cubic inches, or. . . . 8 If oz.
   In Morton's great table the mean of eighteen German skulls was 90 cub. in., that
of five English ones 96 cub. in., and that of seven Anglo-Americans 90 cub. in. The
mean of these three classes, 92 cub. in., is 7 cub. in. less than the mean of the six
crania enumerated ; and these three classes stand at the head of Morton's table.

Without claiming for the Anglo-Saxon skull such a large average capacity as that
deduced from the examples, we are still justified in assuming that it was not at all
deficient in capacitv, and in believing that the people of Germanic race equal, if they

do not exceed, all others in the size of their heads.
   Besides the typical form, there is a large proportion of skulls found in Anglo-Saxon

cemeteries, which present much of the oval form that may be regarded as distinctive

of modern English crania.
   Of the accounts of the ancient German tribes, that of Tacitus is most ethnological.

He says, " I have already acceded to the opinion of those who think that the Germans

have hitherto subsisted without intermarrying with other nations, a pure, unmixed,
and independent race, unlike any other people, all bearing the marks of a distinct
national character. Hence, what is very remarkable in such prodigious numbers, a

family likeness throughout the nation ; the same form and features, stern blue eyes,

ruddy hair, their bodies large and robust, but powerful only in sudden efforts." It
should be recollected these accounts are derived from Italian writers, accustomed to
a people of somewhat smaller stature, and to dark hair and eyes, and for these reasons
likely to exaggerate the more marked differences which arrested their attention in the

ancient Germans.
   That the Anglo-Saxons were a large people wehave the indisputable evidence of their

skeletons. Of three thigh-bones, one is 176 in. long, another ]9'5, and the third
20-5. Of thirty-six thigh-bones of different ancient Britons, the range is from 17 to
19"5 in. The longest therefore is an inch less than the longest of these Anglo-Saxon
femora. Faussett, in the ' Inventorium Sepulcrale,' remarks of a skeleton found at
Crundale, "I think this person must needs have been about 6i feet high." The brothers
Lindenschmit found the skeletons in the Frankish cemetery at Selzen to range from

5| to 7 feet Rhenish, including those of -women, or from 4 ft, 8 in. to 6^ feet English.

One woman actually measured this extreme length, Douglas met with Anglo-Saxon
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

hair in Greenwich Park of an auburn colour ; and Mr. Bateman, near Taddingtoil,
Derbyshire, of a decidedly light colour.

   Dr. Prichard thought the Germans had lost the peculiar features attributed to them
by classical writers, from a change of climate, both which positions are most ques-
tionable, and, indeed, are disproved by the evidence of facts. The present German
natives are a tall stout people with large heads, fair complexions, and generally
light or blond hair and eyes, probably all that was intended by the Italian writers.
This view is quite borne out by Dr. Beddoes's careful examination of people of dif-
ferent districts of our own country. In the Lothians and borders which were subdued
by the Angles and Saxons in the sixth century, he says, " the people seem generally
tall, large, and muscular ; their outlines of face and figure are rounded, particularly in
the forehead and the chin ; the nose varies in form, but as a rule is short and
straightish. The heavy overhanging brow and deep sunk eye, which, with the high
cheek-bones, are generally sufficient to mark out a Scotchman from among a group
of Saxon Englishmen, are in this district comparatively rare. The prevaihng com-
plexion is fairer than in any other district [of Scotland] 1 have visited. The eyes
are in a great majority of cases blue or light grey, but hazel is not an uncommon
colour. The hair varies from light yellowish-red and flaxen yellow, through divers
shades of brown."

   The great mental power of the Germanic races, with its special manifestations in
different tribes ; and the probability that the ancient Germans, and perhaps the Anglo-
Saxons, distorted the skull artificially, were briefly alluded to, previous to the closing
remarks on the striking ethnological position of the lasting permanency of ethnical
characters confirmed by all the evidence adduced.

   On some Volcanic Islets to the South-East of Japan, including the Bonin
                         Islands. By A. G. Findlay, F.R.G.S.

   The recent importance of our commercial relations with Japan, consequent upon
the opening of the ports of Nagasaki and Hakodadi to our shipping, and the increasing
commerce now developing itself between Eastern Asia and North-West America,
has rendered the great ocean-highway between Nippon and the Bonin Islands of
great interest. The dangers of this region to the seaman is much increased by the
rapid Japanese current, first shown by the author in 1850 to run from east to west
across the North Pacific Ocean, in an analogous course to the Atlantic Gulf-stream.
This mighty stream, running to the E.N.E., through the space under consideration,
has given rise to the very complicated nature of the so-believed new discoveries
above thirty of these announcements being, by investigallon, reduced to five or six
rocky islets of very singular character. The islands nearest to Japan, the Broken
Ids, Fatsisyo, the Japanese penal colony, and South Island, were shown to be in
some cases defectively represented. The Redfield Rocks are those discovered by
Broughton, and corrected by Capt. Donnel in 1850, and therefore not a discovery by
the United States Japan Expedition in 1854. The islandS'south of this are, perhaps,
Tibbit Island of 1844, then an island or reef of pointed rocks, discovered by Coffin

in 1825, afterwards announced as new by Capt. Jurien-Lagraviere in May 1850;
again announced as new by Capt. Rogers in 1851 ; again in 1852 by Capt. Drescher

of the ' Walter,' and again in 1856 by Capt. Grove, each person believing that he had
discovered a new island. Others similar were also cited. The next group, perhaps,
is about eight miles to the south of the last, or lat. 31░ 53' N., long. 139░ 59' E.,
was discovered in the Dutch corvette, the ' Koerier,' August 24th, 1849, and is of
a very dangerous character. Jeannette Island, twenty-three miles further south, is
doubtful. Smith Island, in lat 31░ 12' N., long. 139░ 55' E., discovered by Capt.
Smith of the ' Ileber,' March 1846, is a most singular needle-rock, springing from
unfathomable depths to a height of 300 feet, and not more than 250 feet diameter at
the base. It has been seen by others. Ponafidin Island of the Russians lies next,
to the south. St. Peter's or Black Rock, first seen in 1821, and again in 1853, is a
wonderful column of basalt 200 feet high, parallel and quite perpendicular sides, not
more than 150 feet in diameter, and hke a bottle in appearance. It is in lat.
29░42'N., long. 140░ 15' E. The volcanic nature of these remarkable rocks, lying near
the meridian of 140░ E., indicates a continuation of those immense volcanic ranges

 which pass along the Kurile Islands, throughout Nippon, the great Japanese island,
 and thence to the well-known range of spiracles in the Ladrone Islands. At the
northern end of this range is the well-known Mount Fusi, 10,000 or 12,000 feet in

--height, now quiescent. To the south of this volcano is Simoda, a port between

the two capitals of Japan, Jedo and Miako, which has been thrown open to the ships
of the United States in 1854. The dreadful earthquake of 1854 at this place was
alluded to. It totally changed the character of the harbour of Simoda, destroyed
the fine city of Osaca, and injured Jedo. The wave which was caused by this up-
heaval of the land traversed the entire breadth of the North Pacific in twelve hours
and some few minutes, a distance of between 4000 and 5000 miles, demonstrating
the depth of that ocean to be between two and three miles. The diagram illustrating
the paper showed the singular confusion before mentioned in the hydrography of
these small but important positions. The Bonin Islands lie to the southward. They
have recently been made the subject of some uncourteous disputation by the Americans
as to the right of discovery and ownership. There can be no doubt of their Japanese
discovery, and are the Arzbispo Islands of the early Spaniards. Next follows Captain
Coffin in 1824-25, who was believed to be an Englishman, but which is controverted
by Commodore Perry of the United States Navy. The particulars of the discovery
were related. Next, Captain (now Admiral) Beechey saw them in 1827, and took
possession of them before the discovery of Coffin was published. They were colonized
under the direction of Her British Majesty's Consul at Oahu in 1830, the survivors
of those settlers still living there. These islands have been lately explored by the
United States Japan Expedition, and their volcanic origin established. It was hoped
that some authority to repel aggression would be established there, as the islands have
now become important, as they are adapted for a coaling and refitting station for
steam-vessels. The Volcano Isles which follow are tolerably well known, and from
these the volcanic submarine ridges diverge to S.S.E. and S.W., several isolated
shoals and volcanic rocks having been discovered in these directions. The paper
concluded with a hope that our naval officers would endeavour to clear up the embar-
rassing confusion which had arisen from the imperfect accounts given of this now
important region.

Vesuvius and its Eruptions. By Frederick D. Hartland, F.S.A., F.R.G.S,

The first part of this paper (which was illustrated by a series of views) was de-

voted to a geographical and geological description of the mountain ; it then touched on

the legends of the Phoenicians, of its previous volcanic character, and finally gave an

outline of the principal of its fifty-four historically recorded eruptions, selecting from

each the peculiarities that render it most interesting. The 34th, which took place on the
--"A8th of August, 1779, and terminated in three days, was thus described :
                                                                             dense

smoke first issued from the cone, followed by a shower of scoriae and large stones ; an
explosion, of such force as to shake Portici, Torre del Greco, and Torre dell' Annun-

ziata, followed, and then in an instant a fountain of liquid transparent fire began to

rise, and gradually increasing, arrived at so amazing a height as to strike every

beholder with the most awful astonishment. The height of this stupendous column

of fire could not be less than three times that of Vesuvius itself, which rises perpen-

dicularly near 3700 feet above the level of the sea. Puffs of smoke, as black as can

be possibly imagined, succeeded each other hastily, and accompanied the red-hot trans-

parent and liquid lava, interrupting its splendid brightness here and there by patches

of the darkest hue. Within these puiFs of smoke, at the very moment of their emis-

sion from the crater, could be perceived a bright but pale electrical light, briskly

playing about in zigzag hues." This graphic description is from the pen of Sir
U.2 RBPOET-- 1856.

William Hamilton ; but Mr. Morris also states the light was so strong at Sorrento,
nearly fourteen miles off, that he could read large print by it. The column fell partly
perpendicularly, filling up the valley of the Atrio del Cavallo, and partly around
Ottajano. After its fall, the black cloud advanced towards Naples, putting the citi-
zens in great fear, but it did not fall on it. Next day another vast column arose,
but there being no wind, it fell back into the crater. On the 11th some lava was dis-
charged, and Vesuvius was covered with a mass of white cotton-hke clouds, piled one
over another in a colossal mass, scarcely possible to describe.

   The last eruption from its proximity was the most interesting.
   The fifty-fourth and last eruption of Vesuvius took place on the 1st of May, 1855.
The warning of its approach was given early in January, by the opening of a new
crater at the summit of the cone, between the old one and the city of Naples, and
directly across the route of ascent. This crater differed from the others, insomuch
as it was neither sulphurous in its character, nor was it of the usual chimney form. It
was from sixty to eighty yards wide, and a slight smoke issued from its blackened sides.
After its appearance, the report of an immediate eruption was spread, and was
kept up without intermission for many months; but on Monday, the 30th of April,
the symptoms were so apparent, that the guides declared to a party then making the
ascent the number of hours it would be before it occurred. On Tuesday, the 1st of
May, Vesuvius was invisible at Naples, and it was not till the afternoon that the

fact became known that the eruption had commenced. A rush was then made for

Santa Lucia, the spot of Naples from which the mountain can best be seen, and
here the truth became apparent, as the mountain was blazing from several points.
Upon accomplishing the ascent, and after passing the Hermitage, the intense heat
betrayed the approach of the burning element; and after leaving various cascades of
fire, down which half-melting blocks of lava were dashing at a pace to overcome all
resistance, the current of the eruption was reached, and resembled a liquid fiery river
rushing from the side of the cone, and apparently fed from an orifice about half-way
up it, which, amidst flames of fire, was throwing out stones to an immense height,
accompanied by volumes of dark smoke ; whilst all below was clear, and the lava at
times even assumed a bright phosphoric blue. This was the most magnificent part
of the scene, as the ascent of the cone did not repay the risk and trouble. During
this scene daylight dawned, and so earnest had been the attention given to it by the
thousands assembled on the mountain, that although a perfectly visible eclipse of the
moon occurred during the time, it passed, with few exceptions, unobsei'ved. The
eruption continued till the end of the month (27th), and before its close eleven cones
were in active operation, the discharge from which was so great, that at one time
a total falling in of the mountain was dreaded. This discharge, almost unaccom-
panied by the ejection of stones or ashes, was the peculiarity of the last eruption.

      On the Homolographical Maps o/M. Babinet. By Prof. Hennessy.

    Prof. Hennessy explained the nature of the new system of maps, invented by
M. Babinet, Member of the Institute of France, and referred to a letter which that
gentleman had written on the subject to General Sabine. In the new projection all
the meridians are ellipses, and the parallels straight lines ; whence it follows that
the areas included between any two pairs of equidistant meridians are always equal.
It follows that all areas lying between the same parallels and having equal bases
on these parallels will be also equal. This property is not possessed by any of the
ordinary modes of projection, all of which, more or less, distort the actual configu-
ration of the surface of the globe. This new projection, designated by its author
the Homolographical Projectiou, alone possesses the property of making the areas
of the different parts of a map comparable among each other, like corresponding
areas on the surface of a globe. Its value in geography is thus obvious, especially
in such cases as those where relations of surface are important, such as the distribu-
tion of vegetable and animal life, of population, of races, and, generally, in all ques-
tions of physical and statistical geography.

An original Letter from General Mouravieff. By Col. A. Lake.

Return Journey across Southern Africa. By the Rev. Dr. D. Livingston.

Sir R. I. Murchison communicated to the Section an outline of the accounts of

the last journey of the Rev. Dr. D. Livingston, from the western to the eastern coast

of South Africa, as contained in three long and highly interesting letters addressed

to him by that eminent explorer and! successful missionary. The first of these was

written at Linyanti, on the river Chobe, from whence he had been accompanied

across the continent, to St. Paul di Laonda, on the west coast in 10░ S. Lat., by

the natives, whose fidelity to him during his perilous adventures had been rewarded

by being instructed and reconducted to their native place, and is dated the I6th of

October, 1855 ; the second from the Hill Chanyune, on the banks of the Zambesi,
the 25th of January, 1856 ; the third from Tete, or Nyungwe, lower down the

same river.

The map about to be constructed by Dr. Livingston, of the vast unexplored region,

has been for some time in preparation b}' Mr. Arrowsmith for publication in the

volumes of the Royal Geographical Society ; and some of the information contained

--in the letters recently received will occasion improvements in that map, the chief

points of which have, for the first time, been fixed by astronomical observations,

which the undaunted traveller was enabled to accomplish even under all the priva-

tions and dangers of his two remarkable journeys. These observations have beeri

calculated by Mr. M'Clear, the astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope.

Not endeavouring to detail the names of all the African chiefs and places alluded

to, but pointing out generally the line of route pursued. Sir Roderick read those

passages of the first letter which confirmed, by actual observation, a theory he had

himself formed in the year 1852*, of the probable physical condition of the interior

of Africa in modern as well as in ancient times, from the examination of a geological

map of the Cape Colony by Mr. Bain, and from the earlier discoveries of the

Lake Njami by Dr. Livingston and his former associates, Oswell and Vardon ; viz.

that crests of hard rocks constitute both the eastern and western flanks of the con-

tinent, through which the rivers, escaping by deep fissures, have proceeded from a

broad central watery region of no great altitude. Of this interior basin, intersected

--by a network of rivers. Dr. Livingston gives a clear account, some of the waters

even flowing northwards into the Zaire or Congo, and others south-eastwards into

the Zambesi.

The chief geological and mineralogical characteristics of the eastern and western

flanking crest-lands are described, including coal-fields, iron and other ores, and hot

springs issuing from igneous and metamorphic rocks. The internal or watery basin,

on the contrary, is everywhere occupied by calcareous tufa, often of considerable

thickness, in which are enclosed the remains of existing shells and animals of

Athe land and water of the present day.  collection of fossil bones found to

the south of the last explorations, and consigned to Dr. Buckland, has been

unfortunately lost; with measurements of chief altitudes as determined by the

ebullition of water. The return journey from St. Paul di Loanda to Linyanti was

facilitated for a time by the possession of two asses, given to the author by friends

in the Portuguese settlement of Loanda ; these animals being insensible to the sting

of the Tsetse, which destroys oxen and other animals.

In the second letter, Dr. Livingston, then within a few days' march of the Portu-

guese eastern station of Tete, gives a lively and graphic sketch of the remainder of

the route he pursued in proceeding across the eastern hilly region ; and his descrip-

tion of the scenery (aa read to the Section), where the broad river Zambesi, after

forming great rapids, is compressed into a narrow gorge and cascades over a lofty

precipice, amidst the most luxuriant and extraordinary vegetation, afforded the

liveliest gratification. This rocky region is very salubrious, and in passing through

it the traveller is no longer molested by the Tsetse, or destructive insect. The
 author speculates, indeed, on the probability of such hilly sanitaria being extended
vastly further to the north, and adds, " At present there is the prospect of water-
 carriage right up to the bottom of the eastern ridge ; and if a quick passage can be
 effected thither during a healthy part of the season, there is, I presume, a prospect
 of residence in localities very superior to those on the coast." The deltas betvsreen
 such hilly districts and the shores of the eastern as well as of the western oceans,
 are, on the contrary, described as the most unhealthy of all the tracts examined.

    The third letter, much of which was read to the Meeting, gives a general view
of the ethnological distinctions and habits of the various tribes among whom he has
lived and with whose languages he is so well acquainted, assigning a manifest
 superiority in bravery and conduct to the hill people, and particularly to the Caffre-
Zuluh race. He also explains that the Bible has been nearly all translated into
 Sechuana, or the dialect of the Bechuanas, the most regularly developed of all the
African languages. " Of its capabilities (he adds) you may judge, when I mention
that the Pentateuch is fully expressed in considerably fewer words than in the Greek
Septuagint, and in a very greatly less number than our verbose English."

    After a sketch of the zoology and natural history of the region, and a record of
the prevalent diseases of the people, showing that certain maladies which civilized

man cannot eradicate, are often worn out and disappear naturally in South Africa,

Dr. Livingston, adverting to previous explorers, and returning his warmest thanks
to the Portuguese authorities of Laonda and Tete, modestly expresses his belief that

--he is the first European who has travelled across Southern Africa in those latitudes,
    and having acomplished thus much, he speaks of a visit to his native land, but

--only with the intention of returning to exercise his sacred calling. He concludes

in these words : " I feel thankful to God who has preserved mv life while so many
who would have done more good have been cut off. But I am not so much elated

as might have been expected, for the end of the geographical feat is but the beginning

of the missionary enterprise. Geographers labouring to make men better acquainted

with each other, soldiers fighting against oppression, and sailors rescuing captives in
deadly climes, are all, as well as missionaries, aiding in hastening on a glorious con-

summation to all God's dealings to man. In the hope that I may yet be permitted
to do some good to this poor, long trodden-down Africa, the gentlemen over whom
you have the honour to preside, will, I doubt not, all cordially join."

    In conclusion. Sir Roderick called attention to the great merits of Dr. Livingston,

who had justly been honoured with the adjudication of a Gold Medal of the Royal
Geographical Society, and having also adverted to the extraordinary and extensive
travels of Barth in Central Africa, who had received a similar honour, and to the
prospect of fresh explorations both up the Niger and from Zanzibar on the east coast,
to the mountains from whence the Nile is supposed to flow, he congratulated the
assembly on the hope we might now rationally entertain of spreading civilization and

Christianity throughout these benighted lands.
   In the absence of detailed maps, and in the expectation of seeing Dr. Livingston

soon in England, Sir Roderick forbore to enter into any specific account of the
courses of the interior rivers, or to dwell upon data which would in due time be
brought before the Geographical Society.

  --A New Route to India the Syro-Arabian Railway. By John Locke.

    This paper suggested a railway from Acre to Busrah, passing the Jordan between
the 32nd and 33rd degrees of latitude. The gain in space of this line over the pro-
jected Euphratean route was stated to be 400 miles, and in time (making due allow-
ance for greater velocity of locomotive than steamer) two days and a half; and over
the present overland route of 1000 miles, or six days, which might be increased one
day and a half by accelerating the speed in the long level reaches of the Desert,
where the traveller can observe at the distance of several miles any object of a size
likely to impede or endanger a train. Mr. Locke's paper went to demonstrate the
shortness, security and economy (both in time and in cost of construction) of this

route. He also pointed out the facilities likely to be afforded by the Ottoman
government and the Imaum of Muekat, and especially dwelt on the collateral advan-

tages of developing new markets and commercial relations, not only in the Persian

Gulf, but also with the eleven millions of the Arabian peninsula, hitherto almost
isolated from the conditions of modern civilization.

Researches in the Crimean Bosphorus, and on the site of the Ancient Greek
       City of PanticapcKum (Kertch). By Dr. D. Macpherson, F.R.G.S.

The present town of Kertch is built close to the site where 500 years B.C. the

Milesians founded a colony. About fifty years before Christ, this colony became

subject to Rome, or rather a Satrap of the Roman Empire, from the circumstance of '

the Bosphorean kings, who were also rulers of Pontus, having been subdued by

this people in Asia. In the year 375 of our era, the colony was utterly annihilated

by the Huns. Barbarous hordes succeeded one upon another thereafter until a.d.

1280, when the Genoese became possessors of the soil, and held it until expelled

by the Turks in 1473 ; they being in their turn expelled in 1771 by the Russians.
The characteristic features around Kertch are the immense tumuli, or artificial mounds,

that abound in this locality, more especially within the second vallum. These

Wesepulchres of the ancient world are found in many places.  have them in the

form of barrows in England, and cairns in Scotland. Calculated as they are for

almost endless duration, they present the simplest and sublimest monument that

could have been raised over the dead. The size and grandeur of the tumuli found

ia this locality excite astonishing ideas of the wealth and power of the people by

whom they were erected, for the labour must have been prodigious and the expendi-

--ture enormous. The highest specimens of Hellenic art have been discovered in these

tumuli such as sculpture, metal, alabaster and Etruscan vases, glass vessels,

remarkable for their lightness, carved ivory, coins, peculiarly pleasing on account of

their sharpness and finish, and trinkets, executed with a skill that would vie with

that of our best workmen. All originals were forwarded to the Hermitage, at

St. Petersburg, duplicates being preserved in the Museum at Kertch, and these

might have been with ease secured to England on the investment of the place by the

Allies ; but with the exception of some bas-reliefs, which, in connexion with other

two officers, I transmitted to the British Museum, the whole of these rare treasures

were barbarously made away with. The local tradition is, that these tumuli were

raised over the remains, and to perpetuate the memory, of the kings or rulers who

held sway over the colonists, and that the earth was heaped upon them annually on

the anniversary of the decease of the prince, and for a period of years corresponding

to the rank or respect in which its tenant was held or had reigned ; and to this day

successive layers of earth, which were laid on in each succeeding year, can be traced,

a thin coating of sea-shell or charcoal having been first put down. I have counted

as many as thirty layers in a scarp made in one of those mounds, about two-thirds

from its base. They are to be seen of all sizes, varying from 10 to 300 feet in

circumference, and in height from 5 to 150 feet, and are usually composed of surface

soil and rubble masonry. Herodotus's reference to these sepulchres is the earliest

account which history has recorded of this mode of burial ; and I would particularly

draw attention to his description of the mode adopted by the Scythians to perpetuate

mythe mejnory of their deceased princes, for it will be hereafter seen that one of

excavations corresponds exactly with the description given by him. " The tombs of

the Scythian kings," he states, " are seen in the land Gberri, at the extreme point

to which the Borysthenes is navigable. Here, in the event of a king's decease,

after embalming the body, they convey it to some neighbouring Scythian nation.

The people receive the royal corpse, and convey it to another province of his domi-

nions ; and when they have paraded it through all the provinces, they dig a deep square

fosse, and place the body in the grave on a bed of grass. In the vacant space around

the body in the fosse they now lay one of the king's concubines, whom they strangle

for the purpose, his cup-bearer, his cook, his groom, his page, his messenger, fifty of

his slaves, some horses, and samples of all his things. Having so done, all fall to

work, throwing up an immense mound, striving and vieing with one another who

shall do the most." The Greeks, who always respected the religion of the countries

they had subjugated, and who, in process of time, imbibed, to a certain extent, their

customs and observances, appear to have adopted this Scythian mode of burial,

--116 REPORT 1856.

Instead, however, of placing their magistrates or rulers in a " deep square fosse" dug
in the earth, they built tombs, and over these raised the conical hill. I examined
several without meeting with any success. All, or nearly all, of these tumuli have
been already explored. Not far from Mons Mithridatis I came upon a portion of an
aqueduct which probably conveyed water to the Acropolis. It was formed of con-

cave tiles ; one of these, with a Greek name thereon, I have brought with me. On

one occasion I arrived at a place where five stone tombs were found adjoining, neither
of which contained any relic ; but in a spot contiguous a large ornamented earthen-
ware jug and five glass cups, one within the other, were discovered. It was not

unusual thus to find the remains in one spot and the ornaments in another. On

removing the earth off the sides of a rock, the apex of which was only perceptible on
the summit, I struck upon a recess, three sides of a square chiseled out of the rock
16 feet in length and 8 in depth. Following this, I reached a stone seat ; hewn out
on each side of this seat small recesses had been made, apparently for the purpose
of receiving lamps. After descending 12 feet I came to human remains, and for five

days the workmen turned nothing out of this pit but human bones. How far these
would have descended I know not, for I ceased my explorations here, feeling satisfied,

--from the appearance of the bones, that they must have been placed there at the same

period the result, most probably, of some great engagement, for many of the skulls
and long bones presented fractures and injuries. The marks on the rock would
indicate that sacrificial meetings, possibly commemorative of the event, was held here.
Replacing these remains, I proceeded to a point indicated as the tombs of the dimi-
nutive or pigmy race, but discovered nothing that would indicate a peculiar class of

people. Beneath an extensive sloping artificial tumulus, running at right angles

with the ridge extending northwards from Mons Mithridatis, I came upon a mass
of rubble masonry, beyond which was a door leading to an arched chamber, built
under the side of the mound. This led me to a larger chamber, which was also arched.
The walls of the larger chamber were marked oif in squares, with here and there

flowers, birds, and grotesque figures. Over the entrance into this chamber were
painted two figures of griffins rampant, two horsemen, a person in authority and

-- --his attendant the latter carrying in his hand a long spear being rudely sketched

on one of the inner walls. There were no remains of any sort in this tomb or temple.

A recess in the walls on two sides resembled doors blocked up. On removing the

masonry to the right, the skeleton of a horse was found. To the left a human ske-
leton lay across the door. Tunnelling on each side, the work was carried on beneath
the descents of former explorations from above. On the right-hand side the tunnel
extended seven yards, but nothing of interest was met with. On the left, descending
as the tunnel was formed, arriving occasionally at objects possessing much interest, I
came upon a layer of natural slate rock, the sides and roof of the tunnel being com-

posed of artificial soil, charcoal, animal remains, and, as usual, heaps of broken
pottery. Thirty feet from the entrance, the rock suddenly disappeared to the front
and left, the mark of the chisel being perceptible on the divided portion. Tunnelling
on, the rock was again reached 12 feet from the spot where it had disappeared, loose
sand occupying the intervening space, into which the exploring rod, 6 feet long,

dropped without any efibrt. 1 worked down into this shaft 1 2 feet. But the left side
of the shaft, which was composed of the same loose sand as far as the steel rod could
reach, was continually falling in. Moreover, the labour caried on by candlelight of
raising the earth in baskets, and conveying it in wheelbarrows to the outside through
the building was becoming very arduous, and I╗was compelled to abandon the work.
At this period no relics or remains of any sort were discovered, and the steel rod
sunk into the loose sand as if it had been so much flour. I felt satisfied that this
shaft led to rich treasures below, but regard for the safety of my workmen prevented

my proceeding deeper. I now sought out other ground, and selected a place

removed about 100 yards from that I had just left. Descending some 10 feet, I

struck upon a tomb cut out of the solid rock. Not far from this my attention was
attracted to an excavation in the rock, somewhat similar to, but on a much smaller

scale, than that large descent which I had just abandoned. Clearing the surface, I
found that the rock was hewn out 3 feet in width and 12 in length, the intervening space
being filled with sand, similar in all respects to the other into which the steel rod sunk

with ease. Fifteen feet of this sand being removed, I came upon the skeleton of

Aa horse.  few feet further on, an upright flag, 4 feet high, and the breadth of

the shaft, was placed over the entrance of a tomb cut out of the calcareous clay.

The opening faced the east by an arched door, 24 inches wide and 32 high. The

tomb was of a semicircular form, arched, 10 feet by 12 in diameter, and 8 feet high

in the centre. Above the doorway, a lintel stone was placed on which the slab which

closed it rested. The cavity was cut out of the natural calcareous clay, which was

firm and consistent, the form and shape of the instrument by which it had been re-

moved being very distinct. The candle burnt brightly on entering. The floor was

covered with beautiful pebbles and shells, such as are now found on the shores of

Athe Sea of Azov.  niche was cut out of the walls on three sides, in which lay the

dust of what once was human. It was a sight replete with interest to survey this

--chamber to examine each article as it had been originally placed more than 2000
--years ago to contemplate its use, and to behold the effect of twenty centuries upon us

proud mortals. There lay the dust of the human frame, possessing still the form of man.

The bones had also crumbled into dust; the space once occupied by the head didnot

exceed the size of the palm of the hand, but on the undisturbed dust, the position of

the features could still be traced. The mode in which the garments enveloped the

body, and the knots and fastenings by which these were bound, were also distinct.

On each niche a body had been placed, and the coflSns, crumbled into powdei-, had

--number of walnuts the wine and nuts being doubtless placed there to cheer and

support the soul in its passage to Paradise. Some fibulee and common ornaments,
valuable on account of their antiquity, were also found. Continuing my researches

in the same locality, 1 came upon other similar shafts, at the end of which were

the bones of a horse, and then the large flagstone closed the mouth of tombs similar

to the last. I now resolved to make another attempt to explore the great shaft ; the

only mode of effecting this being to remove entirely that portion of the hill above it,

I brought all my labourers to the spot, although the few days that remained of our

sojourn in Kertch would hardly enable me, I feared, to complete the work. Placing

my men in two gangs, each were made to work half an hour without ceasing. On

the third day we struck on two large amphorse, containing each the skeleton of a

child. Adjoining these were the tombs of two adults, and then came the skeleton

of a horse. There was now every indication that a great feast or sacrifice had been

held, for a few feet further on we came upon immense heaps of brokeft amphorae,

fragments of wine jars, the inside of which were still encrusted with wine lees, broken

drinking cups, flat tiles which may have served the purpose of plates, beef and mutton

bones, fragments of cooking pots still black from the smoke, and quantities of charcoal.

Descending still further, we came upon what appeared to have been a workshop

portions of crucibles in which copper had been smelted, corroded iron, lumps of

vitreous glass, broken glass vessels, moulds, and other things being found. Five feet

deeper we exposed the excavation in the rock, and a shaft exactly similar to, but on

amuch larger scale than the descent into the arched tombs. As the hill was removed,

platforms were scarped on the sides, on which the earth was thrown up, a man being

placed on each platform ; and as I descended into the shaft, similar platforms of wood

were slung from above. On the twelfth day we reached a depth of 16 feet in the

shaft, the portion of the hill removed being 38 feet in length, 20 in depth, and 12 in

breadth. The mouth of the shaft hewn out of the rock, 3 feet in thickness, was 18 feet

long by 12 broad. It then took on a bell shape, thediameter of which was 22 feet, cut

out in dark consistent clay, a depth of nearly 7 feet. Beyond this the size of the

shaft became a square of 7 feet, cut out of successive layers of sandstone and calca-

reous clay. When we had attained a depth of 30 feet in the shaft, the labour of

raising the earth became very great ; but by means of a block and shears, which Capt.

Commerell, of Her Majesty's ship ' Snake,' very kindly fixed over the descent, the

work was much facilitated, the earth being slung up in baskets, and the men ascend-

Aing and descending in the same manner.  few feet beyond the bones of the horse,

and exactly in the centre of the shaft, the skeleton of an adult female appeared

enveloped in sea-weed. Under the neck was a lacrymatory, and on the middle

finger of the right hand a key-ring. Three feet further we met a layer of humar;

--skeletons, laid head to feet, the bones being here in excellent preservation, as, indeed-
118 REPORT 1856.

we found them to be ia all places where the calcareous clay came into immediate

contact with them. There were ten adult male skeletons on this spot, and separated

by a foot of clay between each, five layers were found, being fifty in all. I may state

Wethat toads in large numbers were found alive in this part of the pit.  had now

reached a depth of 42 feet in the shaft, the bones of another horse were turned out,
and then we came on loose sand to a depth of 5 feet. Six more skeletons were

here again exposed. The sides of the shaft were regular and smooth, the mark of

the chisel on the rock being as fresh as when first formed. Six feet more of the
loose sand being now taken away, hard bottom could be felt by the steel rod, and

there lay two skeletons, male and female, enveloped in sea-weed ; and in a large

amphora at the corner, which was unfortunately found crushed, were the bones of a

child. Some beautiful specimens of pottery, lacrymatories, beads, and a few coins,

were all that I got to repay my labours on this spot. I examined well on every

side, and in the rock below, for a trap-door or concealed passage, and an abrupt

perpendicular division in the natural strata or layers of calcareous clay appeared to

indicate the existence of such, but I found none. Evetything during the descent

had promised so very favourably, that I fully expected to have found a large chamber

leading on from the termination of the shaft ; but if such does exist, the discovery of

mythe passage to it utterly baffled all  researches. The deep fosse, the mode in which

the skeletons were found at the bottom, the six discovered immediately above these,

the fifty about the centre, and the bones of the horses, are exactly in harmony with

the description of Herodotus of the mode in which the Scythian kings were buried.

The substance which I have called sea-weed, from its bearing a stronger resemblance
to that production than anything else I can compare it with, may possibly be the

"grass" described by Herodotus as used to envelope the body. If such be the case,

the description is in all respects exact.

This wonderful place of sepulture must therefore be Scythian, and date with the

very earliest colonization of the Greeks ; full 500 years b.c. That able osteologist

and comparative anatomist. Professor Owen, confirms this by pronouncing the creuiia
brought with me from the bottom of the shaft, as certainly not of Grecian, but rather

of Indo-European characters, and of the dolichocephalic variety.

On the Plastic Origin of the Cuneiform Characters, and its Relation to our own
                               Alphabet. By James Nasmtth.

    Since Mr. Nasmyth first brought this subject forward in a lecture which he gave
at the Royal Institution in 1838, so much additional interest has been excited in
relation to the cuneiform character in consequence of the admirable discoveries and
researches of Layard, Rawlinson and others, that Mr. Nasmyth availed himself of
the opportunity afforded by the meeting of the British Association at Cheltenham to

recall attention to the subject.

   With this view he gave a complete practical illustration of the mode in which he
conceives the cuneiform character had originated ; secondly, how it was written; and
thirdly, how far he conceives it to have been the parent of certain portions of our
own alphabetic characters.

    In respect to the first part of the subject, namely the plastic origin of the cuneiform
characters, Mr. Nasmyth stated that he considered it was due to the simple circum-
stance of clay or plastic mud, in the form of bricks and tiles, having been employed as
the chief building material by the primitive founders of the cities on the banks of the
Euphrates and Tigris, that the cuneiform character owes its origin and adoption.
Mr. Nasmyth showed, by a practical demonstration of the most convincing kind, that
the peculiar triangular impression or indentation which is the distinguishing feature
or characteristic element and basis of all cuneiform inscriptions, is the direct and
inevitable result of the contact of the angle or corner of a hard or dried brick with

the side of a soft one.
   That the most perfect cuneiform characters can thus be inscribed on soft clay,

Mr. Nasmyth proved to the meeting by rapidly inscribing a vast variety of cuneiform
characters on plastic clay by the means referred to. He then proceeded to state, that
although he considered it highly probable that the first idea of the cuneiform had
thus suggested itself, yet as a brick would be found to be rather an awkward stylus
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                          119

to manipulate with, and as it was only the corner of the brick that was acting as the
stylus, the cumbrous brick would soon be substituted by a triangular stylus as the
most convenient agent to be employed in inscribing the cuneiform on plastic clay.
In proof of this Mr. Nasmyth exhibited to the meeting an impression from a Baby-
lonian brick which he had access to in the British Museum, in which the absolute
size as well as the form of the stylus employed in impressing it was given. This
specimen appeared to set at rest all doubt as to the nature of the instrument employed,
as well as to illustrate the mode of using it. Mr. Nasmyth gave a practical illustration
of the capability of such a stylus in enabling the inscriber to produce cuneiform cha-
racters of a vast variety of size as well as form, simply by varying the depth to which it
was impressed into the clay.

   In conclusion, Mr. Nasmyth stated his views as to the probable connexion that
appeared to him to exist between certain parts of our own alphabetic characters and

that of the cuneiform, referring in this respect to those portions of our alphabetic
characters termed " Serifs," namely, the cross strokes which terminate the limbs of

most of our capital letters. In illustration of this part of the subject he referred to
several ancient Greek inscriptions, in which he showed that the characters of which

they were formed were decomposable into absolute cuneiform elements ; in many

cases the bottom strokes terminating the limbs of the letters were so identical with
the cuneiform element, that they were at right angles to the axis of the limb of the

letter, and not parallel to the line of inscription.

On the earliest traces of Human Remains in Kent's Cavern.
                  By E. Vivian, M.A., Torquay.

The cavern is situated between Torquay and Babbicombe, beneath a conical

hill of the Devonian limestone, extending to a circuit of about 600 feet. It appears

to have been first occupied by the bear and hyena, the remains of which, with the

bones of elephants, rhinoceros, deer, &c., upon which they preyed, were strewn

upon the rocky floor. By some violent and transitory convulsion, a vast amount of

the soil of the surrounding country was injected into the cavern, carrying with it the

bones, and burying them in the inmost recesses. Immediately upon its subsidence

the cavern appears to have been occupied by human inhabitants, whose rude flint-
Aknives and arrowheads are found upon the mud beneath the stalagmite.
                                                                       period

then succeeded, during which the cavern was not inhabited until about half of the

floor was formed, when a streak containing burnt wood and the bones of the wild
boar and badger was deposited, and again the cave was unoccupied, either by men

or animals, the remaining portion of the stalagmite being, above as below, pure and

unstained by soil or any foreign matter. Above the floor have been found remains

of Celtic, early British and Roman remains, together with those of more modern

date. Among the inscriptions is one of interest as connected with the landing of
William III. on the opposite side of the bay, " W. Hodges, of Ireland, 1688."

The position of the flint instruments beneath the stalagmite, although contrary to

the generally received opinion of geologists, and carrying back the first occupation

of Devon to very high antiquity, was shown to be not necessarily at variance with
Scriptural chronology, the deposit of stalagmite having apparently been much more

rapid at those periods when the cavern was not inhabited, in consequence of a greater

discharge of carbonic acid gas. Without attempting to affix with any certainty

more than a relative date, Mr. Vivian suggested that there was reason for believing

that the introduction of the mud was occasioned, not by the comparatively tranquil

Mosaic Deluge, which spared the olive and allowed the ark to float without miracu-

lous interposition, as was once assumed by Dr. Buckland, but by the greater

coavulsioD, alluded to in the first chapter of Genesis, which destroyed the pre-
     --

--120 REPORT 1856,

-- --existing races of animals most of those in this cavern being of extinct species, and

prepared the earth for man and his contemporaries.
   The original formation of the cavern was attributed principally to the action of

trap and the volcanic action which had disturbed the strata in many parts of this
district, causing deep fissures, as at Daddy's Hole and Ansty's Cove.

   The sources from which the statements in the paper were obtained were princi-
pally the original manuscript memoir of the late Rev. J. MacEnery, F.G.S., which
is deplored by Professor Owen, in his Fossil Mammalia, and by other writers, as lost
to science, but which had been recovered by Mr. Vivian and was produced before
the Section ; also the report of the sub-committee of the Torquay Natural History
Society, and his own researches. Photographic representations were exhibited of
the fossils, showing the connexion between the teeth of elephants, horns of deer, &c.,
found in the cavern, and in the submerged forest in Torbay.

   The following was read amongst other extracts from Mr. MacEnery's manu-

 script :

   "The floor we found at our first visit covered, through its whole extent, with a

 darkish mould, varying in depth from a few inches to a foot. It only dates since
the cavern became a popular place of resort, and the further progress of the stalag-
mite in open situations was interrupted by the trampling of visitors. In the vesti-
bule were found, deep imbedded in it, those curiously shaped pieces of oak to which

--the appellation of Druids-sandal was given, as has been remarked, together with a

quantity of decomposed animal and vegetable matter, the remains of fires and feasts,
mingled with rabbit bones.

    " In the crevices of the rock, and in the cavities occasioned bytheoverlappingof fallen
masses, were concealed the skeletons of such animals as strayed or retired hither to
 die, such as dog, hare, rabbit, sheep ; and the remains of the bat, with its delicate
framework spread out on the black mould, were particularly noticed.

    " But, for greater precision and perspicuity, I shall take the chambers in the order

--they are visited in. To commence with the common entrance. Here, once for all, I

must solicit indulgence for entering into details apparently unimportant. In this
cavern are found grouped together, phsenomena which have only been observed
separately in others, dispersed over divers countries. By closely examining the dis-
closures of this, a clue may be obtained to all. At the hazard of unnecessarily charging

the thread of my n arrative with seemingly frivolous particulars, I proceed to note down

the characters presented by its general aspect, no less than its contents, before it was
altered by those operations which have since left no part of it in its original state.
 It is only on a just appreciation of all their circumstances that a true estimate can
be founded of those facts which should serve as the basis of all reasoning on its
nature and history.

    "The floor of the entrance, except that it had the appearance of being broken up,

--offered nothing remarkable to detain us ; we shall have occasion to return to it

presently. Not so the lateral branch by which it communicates with the body of
the cavern on the left ; at this point so great was the obstruction, from the accumu-
lation of mould and a fallen ledge of rock lying across the way, that those who then
visited it will not have forgotten their accomplishing the passage on all fours. These
impediments have been partly removed. Under a similar ledge on the left, still
standing, was found the usual sprinkling of modern bones ; and, in the mould
beneath, which had acquired the consistence of hard claj^ were found fragments of

--pottery, calcined bones, charcoal, and ashes, in the midst of all were dispersed

 arrow-heads of flint and schist ; the ashes furnished a large proportion of the mould.
In the same heap were discovered round slabs of roofing-slate of a plate-like form,
some crushed, others entire. The pottery is of the rudest description, made of
coarse gritty eartb, not turned on a lathe, and sun-baked ; on its external margin it
bears zigzag indentations, not unlike those represented on the urns found by Sir
Richard lioare in the barrows of Wiltshire. These fragments, there seems no
reason for doubting, are the remains of cinerary urns which once contained the
substances scattered around, and to which the slates served as covers. At a short
distance nearer the entrance were found, in a continuation of the same mould, articles

--of bone, of three sorts, some of an inch long and pointed at one end, or arrow-
--heads, others about three inches long, rounded, slender, and likewise pointed.

Conjecture was long busy as to their destination ; they were thought by some to be
bodkins ; by others, for confining the hair, Uke those ornaments used by the women
in Italy ; lastly, they were supposed, with more probability, to be a species of pin

for fastening the skin in front which served savages for garments.

             The shaggy wolfish skin he wore,
             Pinn'd by a polish'd bone before.

"The third article does not seem quite so easy to explain: it is of a different shape,

quite flat, broad at one end, pointed at the other ; the broad part retains the trun-

--cated form of a comb, the teeth of which were broken off near their root, whether

it was used as a comb or for making nets for fishing, is not clear. There was only

this solitary one found, and two of the former, but several of the first, with a quantity

of bone chips. All three bore marks of polish. Nearer the mouth are collected a

good number of shells of the mussel, limpet, and oyster, with a palate of the Scarus.

This, as well as the nacker of oysters, which was thickly disseminated through the

mould, served, as they do at the present day among savages, most probably for

ornament. The shell-fish may have furnished bait for fishing. The presence of

these rude articles render it probable that they were collected here by the ancient

aborigines, who divided their time between the chase and fishing in the adjacent sea.

"Closeto the opposite wall, in the same passage, buried in black mould, I found a

stone hatchet, or celt, of syenite, the only one found in the cavern. Another of the

same material, but of a different shape, I found shortly after, not far from the

cavern near Anstis Cove, which the labourers engaged in making the new cut had

just thrown up with the mould. As we advanced towards the second mouth, on

the same level, were found, though sparingly, pieces of pottery. The most remark-

able product of this gallery were round pieces of blue slate, about an inch and n half

in diameter and a quarter thick. It may have served, like the Kimmeridge coal, for

money. In the same quarter were likewise found several round pieces of sandstone

grit, about the form and size of a dollar, but thicker, and rounded at the edge, and

in the centre pierced with a hole, by means of which they seem to have been strung

together like beads. Clusters of small pipes or icicles of spar, such as depended

from the roof at our first visit, we saw collected here in heaps buried in the mud.

Similar collections we had occasion to observe accompanied by charcoal, throughout

the entire range of the cavern, sometimes in pits excavated in the stalagmite.

Copper ore with these various articles in the same stuff was picked up ; a lump
much oxidized, which the late Mr. Phillips analysed, was found to be pure virgin

ore. Though this branch of the cavern is more spacious and the mouth more ample,

it by no means furnished an equal proportion of antiquities as the other. Several

of these articles were slightly encrusted with a pellicle of stalagmite, according as

they happened to lie within the reach of the drop when exposed on the surface.

Having taken a general survey of the surface of the floor, we returned to the point
from which we set out, viz. the common passage, for the purpose of piercing into

the materials below the mould. Here, in sinking a foot into the soil (for of sta-

lagmite there remained only the broken edges adhering to the sides of the passage,

and which appeared to be repeated at intervals), we came upon flints in all forms,

confusedly disseminated through the earth, and intermixed with fossil and human

bones, the whole slightly agglutinated together by calcareous matter derived from

Mythe roof.  collection possesses an example of this aggregation in a mass consisting

of pebbles, clay, and bone, in the midst of which is imbedded a fine blade of flint,

all united together by a sparry cement. The flints were in all conditions, from the

rounded pebble, as it came out of the chalk, to the instruments fabricated from them,

as arrow- and spear-heads, and hatchets. Some of the flint- blocks were chipped only

on one side, such as had probably furnished the axes, others had been on several faces,

presenting planes corresponding exactly to the long blades found by their side, and

from which they had been evidently sliced off ; other pebbles vs?ere still more angu-

larly chipped at all points, which were no doubt those which yielded the small arrow-

heads, which abounded in by far the greatest number. Small irregular splinters,

not referable to any of the above divisions, and which seem to have been struck off

in the operation of detaching the latter, not unlike the small chips in a sculptor's

shop, were thickly scattered through the stuff, indicating that this spot was the

workshop where the savage prepared his weapons of the chase, taking advantage of
--122 BjspoRT 1856.

its cover and the light. I have discovered in this passage precisely similar arrow-
heads to those which I detected in an urn from a barrow presented to me by
the Rev. Mr. Welland. With the exception of the boar-spear and a blade of the
same metal found not far from it very much rusted, all the articles in the mould, or

--in the disturbed soil, consisted of flint, chert, syenite, and bone, such primitive

substances as have been in all countries, and down to the present, used by the savage
for the fabrication of his weapons, whether for the chase or battle. At a still greater
depth, near the common entrance, in the passage, lay extended, lengthwise, in the

--ordinary position of burial, the remains of a human skeleton, much decayed ; two

portions only of the jaw and some single teeth, with the mouldering vertebrae and
ribs, were all that remained. As in the case of the flint-knife mass, already described,
there adhered to the jaw portions of the soil on which it lay, and of the stalagmite
which partly covered it. The teeth were so worn down that the flat crowns of the

--incisors might be mistaken for molars, indicating the advanced age of the individual.

M. Cuvier, to whom I submitted the fragments, in 1831, was struck with the form of
the jaw. He pronounced it to belong to the Caucasian race : he promised to bestow

particular notice on it, but death, unhappily for science, put a stop to his glorious

--labours. AH the specimens, together with a collection of fossil bones, the third I
--had presented to the museum of the Jardin des Plantes, I transmitted to him

before I quitted the Continent, and may be found among his effects. The skeleton
lay about a foot and a half below the surface ; from the tumbled state of the earth,

the admixture of flags of stalagmite, added to the presence of flint articles and pieces
of slate, it was manifest that the floor had been dug up for the reception of the body,
and that it was again covered over with the materials thrown up from the excavation.
The earthy covering consisted of the red soil, containing fossil bones mixed up with

recent mould ; the mound of earth outside the mouth, at the right hand, was thrown
up from the passage to render it more accessible. It was precisely that which
covered the human skeleton and contained the admixture of human and fossil relics.
Previous to the disturbance of the floor for the admission, of the bod}', it would

--appear, from the presence of flags of stalagmite in the rubble, that it was covered

by a continuous crust, the edges indeed of which still adhere to the sides. It
further appears from the repetition of similar crusts, as indicated by the broken
edges at the sides, that there were periods of repose which allowed new floors to
form, marking clearly their repeated destruction and renovation at intervals of time.
With the exception of single teeth and an occasional rib or vertebra in charcoal,
which may have possibly belonged to the same subject, there were no other traces
of human remains."

       Opening Address by Lord Stanley, M.P., President of the Section.

I BELIEVE it will be my duty to open the proceedings of this Section by a few words

 relative to the purpose of our meeting ; and I must begin by observing, that the
 remarks which follow were prepared before the passing of that resolution of yester-
 day, which has enlarged the scope of our duties so as to include, in addition to
 Statistics, properly so called. Economic Science in general.

     It is needless in this presence to define, at any length, the nature or the object of
 statistical science. The axiom on which that science is based may be stated thus :
 that the laws by which nature is governed, and more especially those laws which
 operate on the moral and physical condition of the human race, are constant, and

-- --are, in all cases, best discoverable in some cases only discoverable by the investi-

 gation and comparison of phsenomena extending over a very large number of
                                                                                                                                                                     --

individual instances. In dealing with the individual human being every thing is

uncertainty : in dealing with man in the aggregate, results may be calculated with

--the precision and accuracy of a mathematical problem. To take a familiar instance,
the  length  of a  single  life  can  never  be known beforehand                                                                                                     but by the accurate
                                                                                                                                                                  ;

keeping of returns the aggregate length of ten thousand or a hundred thousand lives

is easily ascertained. This aggregate length, the conditions of life being generally

the same, approximates to a constant quantity', however often the experiment be

repeated ; and from that quantity, thus obtained, we deduce an average, which, as

the experience of every insurance office shows, is near enough to the truth for ordi-

nary purposes of calculation. Accidental diversities, whether of internal constitution

or of external circumstances, tend to neutralize one another. Their influence

diminishes as the area of investigation increases, until, if that area be sufficiently

extended, we are justified in disregarding them altogether, and in admitting as

approximately, if not as absolutely true, the general inference to which our suc-

cessive trials point. I will not lead you into those strange and startling conclusions

to which Quetelet has come, when comparing some of the averages obtained with

one another, and representing them in mathematical form ; he finds in the laws thus
discovered a close resemblance to, perhaps an actual identity with, those which

operate in physics ; as, for instance, when he lays it down that the obstacles which

oppose the increase of population act in a manner exactly the same as does the
resistance of the medium in which a body moves to the motion of that body. Wide

as is the field of thought which such a suggestion opens, it must probably be, for
many years, premature to enter it : the laws as yet made known to us by statistical

research are too few to allow of generalization relative to their mutual inter-con-

nexion. Enough to cite the dictum of Quetelet, confirmatory of what was said

above, "All observation tends to confirm the truth of this proposition, that that

which concerns the human race, considered collectively, is of the order of physical

facts : the greater the number of individuals, the more completely does the will of

individuals disappear, and allow the series of general facts, which depend upon the

causes by which society exists and is preserved, to predominate                                                                                                      We

must admit, that on submitting to careful experiment unorganized bodies, and the

social system, we are unable to say on which side causes act in their efi^ects with the

greatest regularity."

    This, then, is the first characteristic of statistics as a science : that it proceeds

--wholly by the accumulation and comparison of registered facts ; that from these

facts alone, properly classified, it seeks to deduce general principles ; and that it

rejects all a priori reasoning, employing hypothesis, if at all, only in a tentative

manner, and subject to future verification. It starts from the assumption, verified
by many trials, that human action, fluctuating as regards the human unit, is

approximately invariable as regards the masses which make up society. But there

is another aspect in which it may be considered. As a rule, the degree of certainty

which attends any science is exactly proportioned to the extent to which such science

Weadmits of the application of numbers.      know what has been done for chemistry
--by the discovery of a single numerical law the theory of definite proportions

turning, by one stroke,' into a science, what was before little more than a collection

of important, but detached observations. And what we aim at in statistics is, to

substitute for vague phrases, intended to express certain qualities, arithmetical

formulae, by which the came idea may be conveyed with a precision to which

language alone cannot attain. For instance, the uneducated man, speaking of a

climate or season of the year, will say only that it is warm, hot, or very hot ; the

statistician registers the temperature of each day, strikes an average, and gives his

result, in numerical form, extending, it may be, over a period of several years, and
calculated, accordingly, with the most absolute accuracy of which human investi-

gation is capable. Again, the traveller, in describing a nation which he has visited,

writes that offences of violence are exceedingly common, probably more so than in

any other country ; the statistician obtains returns of convictions, distinguishes the

different classes of crime, ascertains the per-centage of murder, or assaults per head,

on the total population, allows for the probable amount of undetected criminality,

and finally compares these results with others similarly obtained in other parts of

the world.

   When, therefore, in discussing social questions, we apply the statistical test, we

--are really doing nothing more than appealing from imagination to fact, from con-
--jecture to certainty from an imperfect to a perfect method of observation. In the

principle, srrictly speaking, there is no novelty : every sensible and observing man
who has lived in a civilized state of society, has been to some extent a statistician

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

the novelty, consists, first, in the greater accuracy with which, and the enlarged

scale on which, facts can be collected in modern Europe ; and, secondly, in the

practical application of that theorj', which to philosophers must, from the analogy

--of inanimate nature, have always appeared probable the theory, namely, that

organized beings, taken in the aggregate, are governed in their acts by determinate
and discoverable laws.

It is obvious that in a science of this kind, unlike many which have occupied the

attention of mankind, little room is left for imagination, and as little for error. On

the  first  ground,  the  study is  unattractive even  to  many who  appreciate  its  value                            on
                                                                                                                    ;

the second, it is eminently and necessarily progressive. " Hypotheses non fingo,"
--those memorable words of Newton's should be written over the door of every

Statistical Society in Europe. Nor is there any branch of mental exertion so

calculated to promote a cosmopolitan habit of thought and feeling. Man is the

object studied ; and man, so studied, is seen to vary in difi^erent countries only in

consequence of discoverable influencing causes, such as race, climate, food, laws,
modes of life, &c. However great, therefore, the external differences between

branches of the human family, the tendency of sociology is to eliminate these
differences one by one, to refer each of them to its several specific orgin, and thus,

finally, to bring to light the essential unity of type which underlies them all.

   I would also observe, that as an experimental science, the progress of statistics is

not liable to those delays which impede the advance of manyother branches of know-

--ledge. Where, as in mathematics, the work to be done is transacted necessarily and

exclusively within the mind of the discoverer, where not the quantity, but the

--quality of intellect brought to bear is all-important, great advances are rare, for

the plain reason that they can only be made by men of extraordinary capacities.
No number of ordinary proficients in mathematics, working jointly, can make up

for the absence, or supply the place, of one Newton. But though not one man in
ten thousand can be distinguished as an analyst or a geometer, the number is far
larger of those who possess the mental requisites for statistical investigation, at least

in its simpler forms : and without disparaging the remarkable talent for arrangement
and generalization evinced by such men as Quetelet, and by some of our own country-

men whom I will not here mention, it may be safely affirmed that the extension of

statistical inquiry depends less on the appearance among us of any one mind of
more than common power, than on the sustained and cooperative industry, encouraged
by the State, of many minds trained to this pursuit, and each taking a separate and

distinct department in which to labour.

It is almost superfluous to point out the sources of those errors which most

beset statisticians. They may I think be reduced under two heads : (1) Calculation
of mean results from an insufficient number of data ; a fault, from the effects of which,

in finances, many provident societies are suffering grievously: (2) Calculation of
mean results without sufficient care being taken to eliminate disturbing causes :

whether this omission arises from the classing together of phsenomena essentially

distinct, and referable to separate laws, or from omitting to make allowance for

imperfections in the data supplied, e.g. as though one engaged on criminal statistics

were to assume that all oflfeuces committed were actually brought to light, overlooking

those in which no detection follows, and, consequently, in which no trial takes place.

Neither of the sources of error which I have mentioned are difficult to avoid. The

one danger against which they warn us is that of premature conclusions. In all

physical science, but in no science more than this of which we treat, is supension of
judgement necessary. I mean by the phrase, that temper of mind which says, " I

neither believe nor disbelieve ; evidence is wanting to do either. I only wait and

Howhold myself free from bias until further facts are adduced."                  easy this is in
--theory, how hard and painful in practice, need not be told to any one who has

given time, and thought, and toil to the proof or disproof of a scientific hypothesis.

Time would not allow me to attempt even the most rapid and hasty survey of
                                                               --

what has been done, and of what yet needs doing, in the way of statistical research.

--Generally, I think we may say this of the progress of the science in England,

that what defects remain arise principally from causes beyond the 'control of indi-
viduals. Statistics are the function of the State in a sense in which no other science
is so. The details of population, of employment, of instruction, of religious worship,
of commerce, and of health, are already recorded in official publications; those of
agricultural production we may hope will shortly follow. The branch which I

principally note as deficient is that which relates to civil and criminal judicature.

class of offences (of late much increased) which are dealt with under summary juris-

diction. It is not wise in any country to copy servilely the practice of another : local
diflferences may create and necessitate diversity of procedure. But I may refer to
the annual reports (two yearly volumes) of the Minister of Justice in France as
examples of an almost perfect arrangement of compUcated statistical details. One
result of that publication is to show a vast local difference between department and
department in the nature and amount of crime. It is obvious, that when such a
difference is shown, by the lapse of a sufficient period, to be chronic and not merely
casual, the Government, whose attention is thus invited, must feel itself bound to
investigate the source of the evil, and, if possible, to provide a cure. In fact, an
executive regularly supplied with such knowledge, may be said to have its finger on

the pulse of every province, ready, at the first symptom of disease, to intervene with

the requisite remedy.

  There is another suggestion which I may make, and which indeed connects itself

with this last. I allude to the advantage, I might almost say the necessity, of esta-

blishing a Statistical Department of Governnient, charged with the annual publication

of such facts relative to the management of national affairs, as are reducible to nume-

Werical expression.  have statistics enough presented to Parliament every session,

but they are, in the great majority of cases, called for by individuals. They are drawn

out to suit the particular purpose of those who move for them : they are, accordingly,

deficient in unity, and often of no use beyond the moment. Now I speak from some

personal observation when I say, that at a cost hardly greater than that of these

desultory, fragmentary, isolated returns, (which have in addition the inconvenience,
coming as they do, at unexpected times, and without any regularity, of throwing a

sudden increase of work on particular offices,) it would be possible to present to the

nation such a yearly resume of administrative statistics, as should, to a very great

degree, supersede the present system (if system it can be called) of moving for returns

as, and when, they are wanted.

I have said that I think a Statistical Department desirable, instead of a Statistical

Branch in every Department ; because the former method gives better security for
unity of plan, and because the work will be best done by those whose sole and undi-

vided business it is.
   I have not referred to the meetings of the International Congress of Brussels and

Paris, because on such a subject I could offer no remark that would not naturally

occur to those whom I address. Such meetings have a twofold value. First, they
extend the field of statistical research : and we have seen that accuracy of result

varies directly as the magnitude of the area of investigation. Secondly, they form

a new link between nation and nation ; because, though speech differs, arithmetical
notation is the same everywhere. In proportion, therefore, as numerical is substi-
tuted for descriptive statement, we approach nearer to that otherwise impracticable

--dream of philosophers a universal language.

   There is, I believe I may state, a probability of the Congress of 1857 being held
in London ; an expectation which seems both natural and reasonable, inasmuch as
it has been averred in public, and not denied, that the first design of holding such
--126 REPORT 1856.

international meetings was suggested by the analogy of the Hyde Park Exhibition

of 1851.
   Should the eVent I allude to take place, it will become the duty of all concerned

in statistical science to see that such an opportunity does not pass unimproved ; so

that 1858 may find us with a thoroughly organized system for the annual collection
and publication of national facts, assimilated, if possible, to the systems of France
and Belgium. For it must be borne in mind, that the objects to be aimed at are
two : one, the adoption of a method as perfect in itself as possible ; the other, the
assimilation of that method to those which prevail elsewhere, so that nations may

mutually profit by each other's experience.

   As a proof how much such comparing of notes is required, I may remind you that
the census of Ireland and Scotland was taken in a manner different from that of
England, while no attempt has ever been made to bring the entire British empire,

including India and the colonies, under a single statistical organization.

   The constitution of such a statistical department as we require is matter of fair
discussion at the approaching Congress. Probably the most effective combination
of working talent would be that obtained by the appointment of a Commission or
Board, to preside over the issuing of official publications, partly composed of scientific
men, partly of members of the permanent or parliamentary administration (the for-
mer preferably, as having more leisure), who would bring in the necessary element

of a knowledge of official customs. This is, I believe, the system actually existing
in Belgium. In Prussia there is a Minister at the head of the Statistical Department.
Those who wish to see the question more fully discussed, will find information in a
valuable Report by Dr. Farr to the Registrar- General, dated October, 1855, p. 108
et seq., of the Registrar- General's Sixteenth Annual Report. It was also gone into
at the Paris Congress of 1855, and a debate upon it will be found in the volume of

Proceedings, s. 360 et seq.
    1 wish also to point out to the Association the advantage of such a communication

between the Home Government and the leading British colonies, in reference to the
approaching Congress, as may enable such of them as desire it to represent themselves

by means of delegates.
    Before I conclude, let me read two letters from the Secretary to the London Sta-

tistical Society, giving an account of an important work in which its members are
engaged, the only work of the kind which the Society has just now on hand,

 --My" Lord, A Committee was appointed by this Society on the 25th January

of this year to collect information relating to the Beneficent Institutions of the Me-
tropolis. The class of institutions to which their attention was first directed was
the Medical Charities. They have received reports from 49 hospitals, of which the
total annual income is Б352,370, and from 58 dispensaries, with a total annual

income of Б28,192 ; besides this, the Samaritan and other small funds connected

with hospitals have an income of Б1656 ; the Poor-Law-Board's expenses for medi-
cal officers are Б28,000, and for vaccination Б4000, so that the total sum expended
in medical relief in the Metropolis is Б414,218 per annum. The Committee will
shortly be able to publish a detailed account of the items of which this income con-

sists, deduced from the reports of the institutions themselves.

Statistics and Suggestions connected with the Reformation of Juvenile Offenders.

                             By T. Barwick Lloyd Baker.

   The author commenced by saying that it was not necessary at the present time to go

--into the general question whether Reformatories were good or bad. The voice of the

country had decided that point, and probably by Michaelmas there would be only two
counties which would not be provided for. But there were three points which he
thought had hardly received the attention they deserved : and he would confine him-

self to these.

   The first and principal point was the necessity of paying attention, not merely to
the individual boys who chanced to be committed to the school, and endeavouring to
reform them, but the paying attention also to the statistics of juvenile crime in the
district, with the view of finding out all those who are extending the evil by cor-
rupting and teaching others. The apprehension of one or two leaders of a gang will
frequently restore the others to at least comparative habits of honesty : but what is
far more important, the apprehension of one or two instructors in crime will prevent
the temptation and fall of perhaps eight or ten others whom they would have corrupted.

He produced some local statistics of juvenile crime, showing that the number of boys

under 16 years, convicted in the Cheltenham district of any offence since the 1st of
January, 1852, was 149. Of this number, 54 may be termed regular thieves; 39 have

been, or are at Hardwicke, of whom two had not been convicted ; 9, convicted once
16, twice; 6, three times; 4, four times; and 2, five times. Of these youthful pri-

soners nearly all had had a fair education*, and could read and write well; and the
statistical result, in that point of view, did not show that mere instruction prevented
the necessity of reformatory schools. Mr. Baker explained that the object of the
reformatory school was to clear out of the district all who might be termed regular
thieves, and gradually to reduce to the lowest the amount of criminality which might
be considered to confer the title of regular thief. This, he said, must vary in different
towns. In Liverpool, from which place he had lately had several boys, there were
many who lived entirely by plunder for years together ; and a boy who usually works,
and only occasionally steals, even though he might be three or four times convicted, was
comparatively a trifling case. In Cheltenham he did not believe that for the last
three years there had been a single boy belonging to the place who had gained one-
half of his keep dishonestly for a month together. The term, therefore, "regular
thief" is applied to all who had been convicted a second time, even though many of
the cases were extremely slight.

    Extracting from the total number of convicted boys returned by the Cheltenham
police during the 4| years all those who either were convicted a second time, or whose
first offence was considered sufiiciently serious to send them to a reformatory school,
it gave a total of 54 regular thieves, i. e. either twice convicted, or such as were
thought worthy of being sent to the Hardwicke Reformatory on a first conviction.
Of these, 39 had been, or still were, at Hardwicke, 8 were long past age, and 7 are still

in the town. Of these seven, tvi^o have not been convicted since May 1854; and the

other fivef, though repeatedly convicted, were merely very slight cases of vagrancy.
Considering that in January 1852 there were 20 boys who had been twice, thrice,
or four times convicted, this result he (Mr. Baker) considered not unsatisfactory.
With regard to the 39 boys who had been or were at Hardwicke, he by no means
pretended that all were " reformed," past the possibility of again falling into crime.

   * Of 39 who have been sent to Hardwicke, 15 could read and write well, and were well
up in the four first rules of arithmetic ; 17 could read and write sufficiently to understand and
we understood, though with incorrect spelling, and were fairly up in addition and subtraction ;
and 7 only were below this point.

   t Of these 5, 3 have been since committed to Hardwicke.

He could not predicate more of them than he could of himself. But all had at least

been kept long enough away from Cheltenham to break the course of education which
had been handed down from boy to boy. Of fifteen who had left the school, six were
doing well, one had fallen, but was still hopeful, three unsatisfactory, but never con-
victed, four had been convicted, and one had not been heard of lately. The other
twenty-four were still either in his (the Hardwicke) school or in others, where situa-
tions would probably be found for them that would keep most of them away from

Cheltenham. He was by no means one of those who abused the prison system. In
many points it was admirable ; but it certainly had the grand failing, that after a boy
or man had undergone his punishment he was returned to the world with very little

--capability of earning an honest livelihood, or doing anything but steal again. Now,

he thought they might say, 1st, that they had been able at Hardwicke to receive
for two years all regular thieves, and to break off the connexion between them and
the innocent ; 2ndly, that they had wiped off from themselves the reproach of com-
mitting boys to prison, and then turning them out without enabling them, if they
pleased, to live honestly ; Srdly, that they had reduced the degree of evil necessary
to confer the title of regular thief as low as they could well hope, there being now no

--such thing as a gang, or connexion between the dishonest boys, but all being merely

boys yielding to a sudden temptation, not premeditately planning a theft.

   The two other points he would touch upon very briefly. When a boy was once

committed to the school for two years, he believed it was by no means intended by the
Legislature that he should necessarily remain the whole of those two years at the
school. It was extremely undesirable that he should do so, because it would then be
difficult to find a place for him exactly at the moment that his sentence chanced to
expire. Power had been given to the Secretary of State to release a boy at any time
upon good grounds shown for it ; he always appeared willing to exercise this power.
But if he could go further, and, without granting a pardon, he could allow a boy leave
to go on trial for a time, it would enable the managers, if the boy behaved ill or did
not suit his place, to receive him back again, and at any rate to keep a more thorough
surveillance over him for the first part of his new service.

   The third point was the allowing a parent or guardian, where good proof of respect-
ability could be shown, and in such cases as in the opinion of the committing magis-
trates and manager of the school should be desirable, to bail a boy out from the school,

on finding security for his good behaviour for a time longer than the expiration of the

--sentence. Mr. Baker then concluded by recapitulating the three points : First, the

giving attention to clearing a district* ; second, the giving leave on trial; third, the

permitting hail.

             Statistics of Cheltenham. By Richard Beamish, F.R.S.

   This paper gives a short account of the early history of Cheltenham, its connexion
with the Crown, and grant to the celebrated Bohun, Earl of Hereford, its present
government under commissioners, and its rapid increase in population from 3076 in
1801 to 35,051 in 1851, being greater than that of any town in England, with the ex-
ception of Lemington Priors, which in 1801 numbered but 315 inhabitants, and in 1851
15,724; Cheltenham having increased 1039-5 per cent, in 50 years, while Leming-
ton in the same time increased 4891 '74 per cent.

   The paper further shows the salubrity of the climate of Cheltenham in the longevity
of its inhabitants, and its immunity from epidemic diseases, cholera never having
visited the town, which is attributed to the high range and great equality of tempera-

* The Gloucestershire Quarter Sessions at Midsummer ventured on what will probably be

a most important step in recommending to the magistrates of the county, as a general rule,
{not without exception nor interfering with the due discretion of the magistrates) to send all
boys on a first conviction to gaol for one week (thus securing the lowest diet, and not giving

them time to overcome their dislike to a prison). If they are convicted a second time, to

send them to the Reformatory. If they relapse after this, they fairly merit penal servitude.
   If this be feasible, as it probably now is in Gloucestershire and will be in all counties when

they have had sufificient time, three important points will be gained. 1st. There will rarely
be any boys in our gaols. 2nd. No boys can become habituated to gaol. 3rd. Unless the
police are very careless, no boys can obtain sufficient practice in crime to enable them to

teach others.

Si in 1851 throughout the kingdom, Cheltenham reckons 1 in 6, whilst the accommo-

dation afforded for religious worship in its churches and chapels amounts to no less

than 60 per cent.

Interesting details are given of the rise and progress of the various schools and pro-

prietary colleges, and more particularly of the resuscitation of the Cheltenham Gram-

mar School, the amount of money expended by these establishments in the town, that

of the Cheltenham Proprietary College being upwards of Б16,000 per annum; the

Grammar School and Training College upwards of Б5000 each. The author dwells

strongly upon the importance of schools for the adult poor. " Father and son," he ob-
serves, " are thus found learning the same lesson ; both drinking at the same purifying
fountain both being made to feel that there are higher pleasures than those of the

                                               ;

senses, and that being without well-being may be a curse rather than a blessing."
He considers that it is beginning at the right end, and " that however children may

be instructed in their schools, their moral development must still depend upon their

homes." He adds, " that it is scarcely possible to conceive any antagonism greater

than the influence sought to be exercised upon the minds of children in a well-organ-

ized school,  and those to which they are                                subjected  in  a  rude  semi-barbarous home
                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

but bring the parent into sympathy with the intellectual and moral progress of the

child, and the whole atmosphere is changed. Education then really commences, and

every subsequent step in the path of knowledge adds another element to the lofty re-

ciprocities of domestic and social life, and affords another defence against immorality

and crime."

Pauperism and crime is brought into juxtaposition, and some illustrative evidence

given of the evils resulting from eleemosynary institutions, in which Cheltenham, like

Salisbury and Newbury,abounds, and which are found to exercise a baneful influence
upon the moral condition of the people, and to weaken the efforts of the local autho-
rities. In Cheltenham, the result seems to have been to increase largely the amount
of larceny and of pauperism, although vagrancy has been repressed to the extent of

70^ per cent, since 1849.
   The paper closes with an account of the Reformatory at Hardwicke Court, and the

benefit which it has conferred on the county generally, and on Cheltenham in parti-

cular; and the author infers that one-half at least of those whom a prison would have
consigned to a life of infamy, may be rendered valuable, if not worthy members of the

--community.
   His conclusions are, 1st, that opportunity is afforded him whose moral tendencies

are favourable, to break his connexion with the really vicious.

   2ndly. That the instructed thief is deprived of his opportunity of daily exercise in
his art, whereby his chance of future success is reduced to a minimum, and he is made
to feel that life has charms, and labour has sweets which no amount of dishonest skill

can obtain.

3rdly. That the heavy reproach against society is (so far as boys ai'e concerned, and

why not girls?)  thus  removed                                           that it punishes crime without  providing any means
                                                                      ;

by which to change the character of the criminal.

Suggestions on the People's Education. By the Rev. C. H. Bromby, M.A.

   The principles laid down in this paper were as follow :
   1. That a rate shall not take the place but come in aid of voluntary benevolence.
   2. That existing schools as well as future schools, originating in denominational
zeal, and claiming the rate in aid, shall contribute threepence from subscriptions,
collections, endowment, and children's payments, in order to secure for themselves
denominational management.
   3. That a local School Committee shall be empowered to establish new schools, which
children in the receipt of outdoor parochial relief shall be compelled to attend, and

for whom the Guardians of the Poor shall pay the school premium ; and the capita-
tion fee now made by the Committee of Council shall take the place of subscriptions

and donations.
   4. That such a school shall be regarded in the light of a preventive school, and

shall be industrial in its character.
   5. That in all ragged or preventive schools, in regard of moral and religious

instruction, the British and Foreign School might be taken as a type.
   After briefly reviewing the system of public education in present operation, and

which was originated in 1846 by Sir J. K. Shuttleworth, the paper proceeded to point

out the more prominent defects of the system.

The pupil-teacher is apprenticed at an age too early to know his natural fitness for

Hethe office.  is often coaxed into it at 13, and at 16 he finds he has no heart for

the work, becomes desultory in character, and loses rapidly in moral tone. 2.^ There
is a want of unity of action in everything that relates to school-keeping. Each of

Her Majesty's Inspectors has his peculiar views of school-fittings, school-method, and

Aschool-organization.  master is written down by one, and held up another year as

a model. This is a growing evil, and the more so as new regulations place the master

more and more absolutely in the hands of the Inspector. The third great defect is

the present system fails to carry help where help is most imperatively wanted. The
problem which proposes to supply this defect has not been solved. No measure can

succeed which does not distinctly show that the working of the present system will

not be arrested. And yet almost every plan hitherto proposed has failed in this

particular.

  A --Scheme proposed. In order to excite and not to nip nor finally destroy sub-

scriptions, let the amount of support borne by the rate hold a fixed proportion to the

amount of voluntary subscriptions. It is found that in towns the average cost of each

child is at the rate of 1 7s. a-year, or of fivepence a-week for 45 weeks in the year.

Let grants be made to existing schools from the rates of twopence per child to meet

threepence raised by local subscriptions and children's pence conjointly. The pro-

portion in which the latter sum shall be divided may perhaps be left to be determined

by the circumstances of the locality, but a minimum proportion of local subscriptions

should be defined. Such a plan would have the effect of encouraging private bene-

volence up to the extent required, and at the same time it would leave disengaged

any excess now found in the more favoured districts of a borough, for the benefit of

Athose neighbouring localities which are now neglected.   subscriber who now pays

^1 for the school of his own district, finding 10s. sufficient under the operation of the

rate-system, would be likely to divide his original donation with another school, in

order to enable it to claim the benefit of the rates, and remain under Denominational

Acontrol.  great advantage would thus accrue from such diffiision. This plan would

have the direct effect of encouraging combined Denominational action. Local School

Associations would take the place of isolated Church or Chapel School Committees,

and the poorer schools belonging to the same religious society would have an equal

claim with the richer upon the central fund.

  --Compulsory Attendance. There is great reason to fear that free schools in destitute

localities would be comparatively empty without some inducement or compulsion.

Poverty, intemperance, and improvidence, are not likely to beget any high estimation

of school work. In Manchester and Salford, from inquiries of 17,426 families visited,

the following results have been published :

1. Children between 3 and 15 neither at school nor work, 17,177.

132 REPORT-- 1856.

These statistics go to show that no system, however perfect, will satisfactorily meet

the educational wants of the land, so long as the improvident parent is under no obli-

gation to send his children to the school. Even the Denominational Schools already

supply more room than is filled, and if this be the case in the localities where the

presence of the higher orders of society must exercise a favourable influence, it is

more than possible, nay, it is sure that the free and rate-supported schools in wholly

destitute neighbourhoods, will miss their aim for want of children. From the census

return we find 17,002 children attending school in, Manchester and Salford, while

private inquiry in connexion with Mr. Entwhistle's local scheme, gives the number

21,925. Taking the larger figure, and comparing it with the school accommodation

which is given on the same authority, as 74,887 children, we find that two-thirds of

the school accommodation is entirely wasted. How much lost energy therefore may

be expected in those rate-supported schools erected and set to work in the still poorer

and neglected localities, without some species of compulsion ? But for what species
of compulsion are we prepared ? Mr. Horner remarks, " Popular education must be

in some form obligatory, and the successful working of the Factory Act in this respect

is a very satisfactory heyinning." Let the inhibitory clauses of the Factory Act be at

once applied to at least similar fields of child employment ; and in all other desul-

tory and less organized spheres of labour, let it be illegal to employ a boy under 14

who cannot produce the school certificate that he has attended for three years, 172

days at least during each year. Above all we repeat, make it compulsory upon a

child who receives out-door parochial relief, that he attend a day-school at the expense

of the parish, and ultimately make a certificate of school attendance a condition of

the elective franchise. Beyond this it is better to foster than to force. It is a favour-

able sign that the Government have adopted the employment of educational tests as

passports to clerkships in public offices. The example of Government has been hap-

pily followed by the Society of Arts, who have established a system of examination

Awith granting certificates of merit.  large number of capitalists, both individual

and corporate, have signed a declaration that they will give preference to candidates

Afor their more lucrative offices who hold these certificates.  great necessity presses

upon the Government for establishinginstitutionsof secondary education. In France

we find ecoles de dessein and schools of trade ; but in England, the workshop of the

world, where there is no law to compel attendance in the primary school, there is no

opportunity of learning the principles of trade in the secondary school. The time

has gone by when England can safely trust to her coal and iron, when steam can

cheaply convey the raw material to countries who are educating their skilled operatives.

Another instrument of secondary education is the establishment of Free Libraries.

Wherever the measure has been tried the most satisfactory results have followed. In

the Parliamentary Return asked for by Mr. Ewart, we find very interesting details.

At Liverpool, " the number of volumes issued in the first year was 35,928, in the

second 99,021, and the circulation is now 5000 per week."

At Oxford, " during the two years since its establishment 236,000 persons have

visited the Free Library. Here the working-man finds rest after a day of labour,

which he was wont to spend in a far less creditable manner."

At Salford we find the issue steadily increasing at the rate of 10,000 a year, while

a corresponding improvement in taste is observable in the following comparison of

--the character of the books selected. The comparison is limited to 3000 consecutive

issues of books:

--Risumi. In the advocacy of a supplementary measure, let it be distinctly seen

that present schools will not be thinned by proximate free schools, and that they will

not slip under the control of the local board. Let it be felt that such supplementary

measure looks simply at present to the lowest and outcasts of our children. In this

way the religious jealousy of denominations will be avoided, for they never quarrel

about ragged children. According to the census of 1851, there were 132 Ragged

Schools, with 23,643 scholars. Only nine of these schools were connected with par-

ticular denominations. The politician and philanthropist need not fear religious

scruples here. Those who, as a rule, object to all religious teaching except what is

formal and technical, are found to merge their scruples in the paramount necessity

for converting the dangerous classes into new constituents of social strength. Here,

at least, is a work in which the attractive element of philanthropy and pity is stronger

than the repelling element of sectarianism. Nor will the advocates of national eco-
nomy object either. They know that a million spent upon moral and industrial

training will save ten millions in county rates. The simple state of the case is that

two millions are neither at work nor school. The question is, how shall we obtain hold

Weof them?  answer, refuse to feed by out-door relief those who attend no school.

AThis would reduce the two millions by one-half.  fourth below those who receive

out-door relief might still remain untouched, and another fourth above. But the

lower fourth might be thinned by the provisions of Reformatories, and the fourth

above them, who are the children of parents able but unwilling to educate them,

would be stimulated by the improvement of those who are below them, and who are

threatening to supplant them in the walks of life and industry. In Cheltenham there

is a population of 35,000, of which number there are 867 children under 16 years of

age receiving out-door relief. The parents are either hopelessly poor, or culpably

unthrifty, and the majority of the children, as might be expected, are left to chance

and ignorance. This is the point on which to put the screw. More compulsory

measures may indeed be needed, but is the country prepared to adopt them ?

On the Advantages to Statistical Science of a Uniform Decimal System of
   Measures, Weights, and Coins throughout the World. By Samuel Bkown,

   F.S.S., and Vice-President of the Institute of Actuaries.

   There are few facts relating to material objects in which weight and measure do
not form principal points in the comparison ; and if the comparison be made for
commercial purposes, value also becomes a prominent consideration.

   Whoever has undertaken for statistical purposes to reduce a collection of facts to
one measure for comparison, will recall the immense labour which the system of
measures, weights, and coins prevalent even in this country has caused him. If, in
addition to this, it be desired to make the comparison of the results with similar
tables of other countries, how much additional labour is thrown upon him

    This difficulty has of late been felt so strongly since the frequent assemblages of

men interested in science or commerce, that scarcely any meeting of consequence

has been held without an expression of opinion on the incongruities of existing
systems, and the importance of preparing the way for a change. At the Statistical

Congress at Brussels in 1853, a resolution was carried, recommending that in the
Statistical Tables of counties not possessing the metrical system, a column should
be added indicating the metrical reductions of weights and measures. Previous to
this, however, the great difficulty of comparing the measure, weight and value of
articles from so many different countries as were represented in the Great Exhibition
of 1851, had forced the subject on the attention of the Jurors. In every year since
then an addition has been made to the number and influential position of those who
advocate some uniform system. The resolution above quoted only partially removes
the difficulty. It merely suggests the advantages of reducing all measures and weights
to the metrical system, which is already extensively recognized; but it does not provide
the means of dispensing altogether with the great labour required in the reduction.

    The declaration signed by the Members of the International Jury of the Great
 Exhibition in Paris, or Commissioners sent by their respective Governments to the
 Exhibition, takes a more comprehensive view, and, without pledging themselves to
 the support of any particular system, they urge " upon the consideration of their
 respective Governments, and of enlightened individuals, friends of civilization, and
 advocates for peace and harmony throughout the world, the adoption of a uniform
 system of weights and measures computed decimally, both in regard to its multiples
 and divisions, and also in regard to the elements of all the different units."

    At the Statistical Congress held in Paris last year, after a discussion originated by
 Mr. Pent, a resolution was passed still further extending the objects to be aimed at,

 --and applying it expressly to the purposes of the Meeting : ." The Congress, considering
            --

howmuchtheadoptionby different nations of a uniform system of measures, weights,

and coins would facilitate the comparative study of the statistics of different countries,

resolves that it is desirable to put such a uniform system into energetic practice."

Of the extraordinary labour which attends the comparison of the statistics of

different countries at the present time, no better idea could be given than by a little

work containing only a few pages, which was prepared and published by Mr. Wool-

house in 1836, and which is still used by architects and contractors whose operations
are carried on in foreign countries. It is entitled " Tables of continental lineal and

square measures." Table I. contains a list of the principal lineal measures of the

various countries, states, and cities throughout Europe, arranged in alphabetical

order. The columns exhibit to 4 places of decimals the value of a unit of each

respective measure, when estimated in English feet, Florence bracchi, French metres,
Neapolitan palmi, Rhineland feet, Roman palmi, Venice feet, and Vienna feet.

Under each column the number of different places in which the unit of measure is

compared under Table I. amounts to 143, nearly all forming different proportions of
the English foot. In the second table is shown the comparison of square and super-

ficial measures for the same number of places.
    In the discussion which took place at the Institution of Civil Engineers in February

1854, Professor Airy stated that for every different class of objects a different unit

was adopted ; that the multipliers of that unit were counted by the decimal scale of
common arithmetic, and the subdivisions of that unit by the binary scale. Thus he

enumerates

                The Acre (for land measure).

                The Mile (for itinerary measure).

                The Yard (for measure of drapery).

                The Coomb (for capacity of corn, &c.).

                The Gallon (for capacity of liquids).

                The Pound (for grocer's ware).

                The Stone of 8 pound (for butcher's meat).

                The Stone of 14 pounds (for flour, oatmeal, &c.).

And the learned Professor did not consider that the Government ought to enforce a

decimal scale except in coinage.

   Now it is evident that if so many units are to be maintained, having no connexion

with or relation to each other, and if they are not even to be divided decimally, and

if foreign nations may each have as many units equally unrelated to each other, no

great advantage would be gained by any change at all. If the inconvenience of an

alteration of system must be encountered, the one adopted should at least be of such

a kind, that no further change should be necessary, that the system should be decimal

for the convenience of calculation, that it should be distinguished by the utmost sim-

plicity, and that both measures and weights should be in harmony with each other.

The author states that at the present time no system so completely fulfils these

conditions as the metrical system, which, beginning in France, has been since

established in so many countries, and from which, whatever prejudices it may have to

overcome, there seems no desire in any country where it has been introduced, to

withdraw or to substitute any old system for it. Both in weights and measures the
difference is so slight between some denominations of the metrical system and some

used in this country, that very little inconvenience would be felt in the change.

Thus the ton^l015*65 kilogrammes might easily be altered to 1000 kilogrammes.

On the Position of Reformatory Schools in reference to the State, and the

    General Principles of their Management, especially as regards Female Re-

  formatories. By Mart Carpenter {of Bristol).

    Reformatory schools have only been brought prominently before the public during
the last five years, and great ignorance still prevails respecting their real object and

working.

   The old Saxon law distinctly provided that all persons who are by the "act of God "
irresponsible, should not be punished; and that a child "pardonatur, quia infana."
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  ISS

Yet, although in the United States for thirty years, and in France and Germany for
a long period, the school had been considered a fitter place than the gaol for juvenile
delinquents, our own country had forgotten that a child was a child, and till August
1854 had compelled magistrates and judges to punish them as adults. The act 17
and 18 Vict., chap. 86, allows magistrates to sentence young persons under sixteen
to a reformatory school under legal detention ; the schools being private, but under
government certificate and inspection, and the superintendents receiving from Govern-
ment five shillings per week for each child so sent. Further aid, in the establishment
and working of schools, is provided by recent minutes of the Committee of Council on
Fiducation ; and acts have been passed during the present and the last sessions, to
facilitate the practical workings of the original measure. This indeed must simply be

regarded as tentative, the establishment of Reformatory Institutions being left to the
accidents of private benevolence, and the old laws still remaining in force. Hence it
\i.a.Y^ensi\iaXin somelarge citiesandtownsnot a child has been sent to any such institution,
though schools exist in the immediate neighbourhood, and young delinquents swarm
in their streets who are receiving a gaol education in short and repeated imprison-
ments. This painful fact shows the necessity of a law making it compulsory on
magistrates to send to a Reformatory all children on a second conviction ; and on a
first, all children whose circumstances prove that they cannot escape from crime if

left to themselves.
    It is also found that great differences exist in the length of impriaonment to which

--a child is subjected before transmission to a Reformatory School, the time being often

proportioned to the magnitude of the same crime in the adult, and not to the circum-
stances of the child, who often, if of tender years, suffers not a little from the rigours
of the system. The experience of four years in the management of Reformatory
Schools, and a close observation of the effects of diflferent modes of treatment on both
boys and girls, leads the writer to the conviction, that while a lengthened imprison-
ment is most injurious to the physical and mental health of the child, and while his
conduct in prison is in no way a criterion of his penitence or future course, yet the
influence of a short seclusion in a separate cell, under the good influence now happily
administered to such prisoners, prepares the child to receive in a grateful and sub-
missive spirit the advantages held out in the school, and makes him understand the
consequences which his past conduct would entail on him in future life.

    Government has power to compel parents to pay a larger or smaller proportion of
the weekly cost of the child's maintenance ; a power already enforced in Bristol and
other towns. Thus all cause of fear lest the advantages of the school should be a
premium on vice or a relief to the natural guardians, is removed.

    Reasons were given for the well-ascertained fact that girls of the criminal class are
far worse than boys, and more difficult to manage. The object is to restore the young
girl to the natural condition of childhood, and fit her for the social duties of life. The
writer's experience as manager of the Red Lodge Girls' Reformatory School, Bristol,

leads her to give the following recommendations.

   A1 . healthy physical state to be attained, with a view to moral reformation. Venti-

lation, cleanliness, temperature. Out-door play and walks in the country, to supply
 the want of boys' agricultural labour. Food sufficient, and of a more nourishing de-
 scription than is allowed in most pauper schools, the girls having been previously

 accustomed to a stimulating diet.
    2. The child must be brought under steady regular restraint, administered with a

 firm, equal, but loving hand.
    3. They must be trained to feel themselves apart of society ; not to have the dress

 of a caste; and to have intercourse, as far as possible, with persons of virtuous cha-
 racter and loving spirit.

    4. The healthy affections must be cultivated ; the natural ties cherished ; and the
 school made a home, and a happy one.

    5. The activity and love of amusement natural to childhood should be cultivated in
 a healthy and innocent manner. Many useful lessons respecting social rights may
 be built upon it.

    6. Rewards and punishments should be made the natural consequences of actions.

On the Tendency of European Races to become extinct in the United States.
        By Edward Clibborn, Corr. Mem. Nat. Inst. Washington.

The object of this paper was to exhibit the probability of the extinction on the

continent of North America, not only of the Celtic, or Irish race, but of all other

European races, provided intercourse with Europe was entirely interrupted.

The argument was based on a fact admitted everywhere in the United States, that

the town populations there are more healthy and productive than those of the

country districts; and that as the law of extinction of town populations exists in the

United States, as well as in Ireland and other parts of Europe, and as the annual

loss of population cannot be supplied by the country districts, which are, on the con-

trary, in a measure replenished by the towns in the United States, it follows, that in

the course of a few generations, both the towns, as well as the country districts,

--would be left without inhabitants, provided the annual deficiencies in both were not
supplied by the emigrants from Europe.

It was admitted there were some favoured localities in the United States where

the population of European extraction increases by reproduction, and which in some

degree helps to replace the loss of population in other districts, which are, however,

by far the more numerous. It was however argued, from the general unfitness of

the climate to the European constitutions, coupled with the occasional pestilential

visitations which occur in the healthier localities, that on the whole, or on an average

of three or four generations, extinction of the European races in North America

would be almost certain, if the communications with Europe were entirely cut off.

And thus the facts indicated by the extinction of the colony from Iceland, in Nara-

-- --ganut Bay, the extinction of French and German settlements in the West, of
--Spanish settlements in the South, the non-increase of the numbers of people
--representing the old settlers in New York, Maryland, and especially the families

who with Penn colonized Pennsylvania, all told the same sad story, and led to the

inference, that the continent of North America had not been, and was not likely to

become, a homestead to the European races, and which would, from the force of cir-

cumstances not likely to change, die out if the intercourse with Europe wereprevented.

It was also explained, that the probability of the United States being long a tem-

porary homestead to the European peoples was greatly endangered, if not prospectively

barred, by the Chinese emigration, entirely antagonistic in its sympathies, which had

begun to flow in, and which, at no very distant period, promises to overrun the

whole country with an increasing population, whose constitution was perfectly adapted

to the climate, it might be said, in the inverse ratio of its unwholesomeness to the

European  constitution                                                      thus  giving  the  Chinese rice  cultivators  and  others  extra-

ordinary opportunities of plantation not offered to any Europeans, except in a very

few limited localities, the population of which, in the course of time, could not stand

their ground against overwhelming and surrounding populations perpetually at war

with them; so that it was clear from causes now in operation, that no matter how

favourable the circumstances of the European peoples in the United States were,

their extinction at no distant period was certain, provided the connexion of America

with Europe ceased.

On the Diversity of Measures in the Corn-Markets of the United Kingdom.
                          By J. TowNE Danson, F.S.S.

Taking the current circulars ot upwards of twenty firms engaged as corn-factors in

as many of the principal corn-markets of the kingdom, Mr. Danson enumerated the

various measures upon which the prices were quoted, some having reference to capa-

city onl}', some to weight only, and some to both ; and the weights used Varying with

nearly every change of locality. In London the bushel of wheat and all other grain

is determined by the imperial measure. In Liverpool a bushel of wheat means 70 lbs,

in Birmingham, 62 lbs. ; in Gloucester, 60 lbs. ; and in Newcastle-on-Tyne, 63 lbs.

Again, in Birmingham, a bushel of barley means 49 lbs. ; in Gloucester, 50 lbs. ; in

Leeds, ."525 lbs. ; and in Newcastle, 56 lbs. ; and to extend the field of comparison only

extends the variety of measures to be dealt with. The following evils were specified,

as resulting from this want of uniformity in these markets, where, since the promul-

--gation of the Imperial Measures Act, it is vulgarly supposed that tolerable uniformity

has existed: " 1. That in almost all cases in which a seller or buyer of agricultural

produce has occasion to resort to more than one market, he is compelled to deal with

more than one mode of ascertaining the quantity sold ; and that, while such differences

answer no good purpose whatever, they check the freedom of commercial intercourse,

afford facilities for the commission of fraud, often cause mistakes and disputes, and

always involve trouble and loss of time. 2. That the quotations by which producers,

dealers, and the public seek to inform themselves of the variations of the price of the

same commodity at the same time in different parts of the kingdom (in order to their

equalization by the legitimate action of trade), are deprived of a great part of their

proper utility, in consequence of the weights or measures quoted for each locality being

very commonly unintelligible in most others. 3. That the inconveniences thus arising

are increased precisely in proportion as the commercial intercourse of each locality

with every other in the kingdom is promoted, by the improvement of road and postal

communication                                                                        and, hence, are now much greater than they were when reported on
                                                                                  ;

by the Parliamentary Committee of 1833 ; and are growing greater year by year."

On the Connexion between Slavery in the United States of America and the
Cotton Manufacture in the United Kingdom. By J. Towne Danson, F.S.S.

Mr. Danson argued in favour of five propositions, which may be thus expressed:

1. That cotton, from the conditions of climate necessary to its culture, cannot be

grown in  Europe                                                                     but that,  with the single and not important exception of the facto-
                                                  ;

ries in the New England States of America, it is, and must long continue to be,

manufactured almost exclusively in Europe. 2. That the present supply is chiefly

--raised, and for the present must continue to be raised, by slave-labour seeing that

while for fifty years we have sought over the whole earth for cotton, we have during

that time continued to obtain from the slave States of the American Union a continually

increasing proportion of our entire supply. 3. That two-thirds in number at least of

the slave population of the United States have been called into existence, and are now

directly or indirectly maintained, for the supply of cotton for exportation. 4. That

of the cotton thus exported, three-fourths at least in value are raised for, and sent to,
this country alone. And 5. That of the entire quantity we import, four-fifths at least

in value are thus derived from the United States. Each proposition was supported by

tabular accounts extracted from the public records of this country and the United

--States, and the conclusion was expressed thus : " That hence, in the present state of

the commercial relations of the two countries, the cotton-planters of the United States

are interested, to the extent of two-thirds at least of their entire exportable produce,

in the maintenance of the cotton manufacture of the United Kingdom ; and that,

reciprocally, the cotton manufacturers of the United Kingdom, and through them the

entire population of the kingdom, are interested, to the extent of more than four-fifths

of the raw material of that manufacture, in the existing arrangements for maintaining

the cotton culture of the United States."

On the Wirral Peninsula, and the Growth of its Population during the last
  fifty years in connexion with Liverpool and the Manchester District, By
  J. TowNE Danson, F.8.S.
   The Wirral Peninsula is that tract of land, part of Cheshire, lying between the

Mersey and the Dee, and about 60,000 acres in extent, on the eastern border of
which has recently sprung up the town of Birkenhead. The following Table exhibits
the growth of the population, on the assumption that Birkenhead is, in fact, an oflF-
shoot of the town of Liverpool :

   The author observes in conclusion, that from the official returns he can trace only
those family connexions that are denoted by a similarity of name. The relation of
fathers-in-law and sons-in-law, of brothers-in-law, of uncles and nephews, and of
cousins, may exist in cases where the parties have different names. He professes only
to give an analysis of the facts stated in the returns, and he abstains from stating any
opinion as to whether family relationships are beneficial or otherwise as an element in
the composition of our Banking Institutions.

                                            By R. Thompson Jopling, F.S.S.

 --The battle of the Alma was fought on the 20th of September, 1854, and Sebastopol

was taken on the 9th of September, 1855, a period of little less than a year. During

this interval three, or including the battle of Sebastopol, four, distinct battles were

fought, besides several minor ones, such as the attack on the Quarries on the 7th of

June                       the attack on the Redan on the  18th of June                                                          and others.

It appears that the total number of officers killed in action was 162, and of those

dying subsequently from wounds 62 making together 224. Of these, 4 were Major-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

Generals, 5 Colonels, 21 Lieutenant-Colonels, 16 Majors, 77 Captains, SB Lieutenants,

11 Ensigns and Cornets, 1 Quartermaster, and 1 Surgeon. Among the Captains, 62

were killed in action, and 15 died subsequently from wounds; while among the Lieu-

tenants, 60 were killed in action, and 28 died from wounds, proving how much more

Captains are exposed to sudden death (i. e. to be killed in action in proportion to dying

subsequently from wounds) than Lieutenants, and, indeed, looking generally at Table

I., than any class of officers.

The following Table shows the number exposed to risk, the number killed or dead

from wounds, with the rate of mortality, for each of the four battles before alluded to.

Under the column of Sebastopol, the deaths therein stated occurred from the two

attacks on Sebastopol on the 18th of June and the 8th and 9th of September, 1855,

as well as the Quarries on the 8th of June, and also include officers killed in the

trenches by chance shots, &c.

Of the Indian wars, the statistics of which the author elaborates in his paper, the

greatest mortality occurred at the battle of Ferozeshah, where it was 1 in 12 (12-4),

and the lowest at Alliwal, at which only 4 officers were killed, the mortality being 1 in

58 (58-2). Of the Peninsula wars, Waterloo shows a mortality of 1 in 12 (12-3), at

which 186 officers were killed ; while at Vittoria, where the number of officers killed
amounted to 44, the mortality was only 1 in 58 (58'5).

   The number of officers who died of disease in the Crimea amounted to 148, being
a per-centage on the total number sent out of 4i (4-5), or 1 in 22. This number of

148 consisted of 28 field officers, 30 Captains, and 90 Subalterns. If we add the
numbers of those who were killed in action, and died subsequently from wounds, we

shall have 74 field officers, 107 Captains, and 191 Subalterns, making together a total

of 372.

The following abstract shows the general result of mortality from all causes :

             Killed in action                    5 per cent.

             Died of wounds                      2 per cent.

             Died of disease                     4Д per cent.

             Deaths from all causes              llf per cent.

Hence the total number of deaths from all causes, during the whole of the Crimean

campaign, which extended over rather more than twelvemonths, were 372, beng 11
(II -5) per cent., or about 1 in 9 (8-7) of the number sent out.

   The author concluded by stating, that at a subsequent period he purposes laying

before the public a complete statistical review of the whole question, including every

branch of Her Majesty's service, and enlargingmore particularly on the general sickness
of the army, and on the mortality from disease. On these latter points the peculiarities

of each disease will be carefully considered, with the causes producing them, the

influence of seasons, temperature, humidity, the prevailing winds, and other incidental

conditions.

The new standard of lineal measure to be the fathom of 6 feet, marked on a rod of

brass or other metal, and made equal to 6 feet 0*91548 inch of our present measure,

at the temperature of 62░'6 of Fahrenheit, or 17░ of Celsius's thermometer, when the

barometer stands at 29 inches and 4 tenths of an inch of the new measure. This

proportion will make the proposed mile equal to 1012'715 fathoms of our present

measure, being the mean length of the minute of a degree of the terrestrial meridian,

according to Mr. Airy's treatise on the Figure of the Earth in the ' Encyclopaedia Me-

tropolitana.' Should more extensive surveys of meridional arcs, since made or in

progress, lead to a more accurate value of the said minute, it is proposed that the

necessary correction shall be eiFected, not by changing the standard rod, but by

altering the legal temperature to a higher or lower temperature than the above.

    In measuring works of architecture and engineering, the foot and its decimal sub-
divisions will be the unit without reference to the fathom ; and all workmanship
measured by lineal measure must be priced by the foot, the 10 feet, or the 100 feet,

not by the yard or rod.
   For Itinerary Measure or Land Surveying the fathom will be the unit without

reference to the foot. The mile will be the nautical or geographical miles, the only
universal measure recognized by all civilized nations. 'J"he proposed new fathom and

--foot will differ so little from our present standards only by one-eightieth part of the
--latter in excess that, supposing the two fathoms to be set up at some little distance

apart, no person standing between them, and who consequently could not see both at
the same time, would be able, after having looked first at one and then at the othei',

to say which of the two was the shorter.

II. New Square or Superficial Measure proposed.

foot, by the 10 square feet, or by the 100 square feet, and not by the square yard

or rod.

                                                For Cloth Measure.
   Cloth to be priced by the new or imperial yard, in the same manner as is now done

10 cubic feet                                      1 quarter of corn.

In measuring corn for wholesale dealings, as well as sand, lime, &c., wooden boxes

of 1 cubic foot and of 5 cubic feet respectively, open at the top and bottom, and laid

upon a level floor, to be used; two of the latter to be put together, one over the other,

to measure a quarter of corn.

           Liquid Measure for Wholesale Dealings.

100 cubic inches                                   1 can.

1 000 cubic inches                                 1 cubic foot.

         Liquid Measure for Retail Dealings exclusively.

Beer, wine, and other liquors, sold wholesale, to be gauged and priced, and the

duties collected by the cubic foot and can

In retail dealings, the cubic foot, divided as above into 10 cans, 25 quarts, 50 pints,

100 chopins and 200 gills, if sold in bottles, should be priced by the 10 bottles instead
of the dozen, and each bottle should contain a quart or pint of the new standard.

When not bottled, to be sold in pewter pots or other measures, being respectively the

same aliquot parts of the new cubic foot that have been specified.

         New Apothecaries' Liquid Measure proposed.

50 minims                                   1 tenth of an imperial cubic inch.

500 minims or 10 tenths . . 1 cubic inch.

10 cubic inches                1 half-pint or chopin.

This will differ so very little from the present apothecaries' liquid measure, that no

medical practitioner can hesitate in adopting it.

The standard one-pound weight to be exactly one-sixtieth part of the weight of the

new cubic foot for distilled water as ascertained by brass weights, at the temperature
and state of air before mentioned. By this arrangement 100 lbs. of the new will be

equal to about 108 lbs. of the present avoirdupois weight.
   All goods now sold by avoirdupois weight to be priced in fiittne by the imperial

pound, and its decimal multiples the 10 lbs., the 100 lbs., and the 1000 lbs., to the

exclusion of stones, quarters, hundred weights and tons of our present avoirdupois
weight. For retail purposes the new ounce and its tenth parts to be used.

For Coins, Bullion, 8fC., and for Apothecaries' Weight.

10 hundredth parts of a grain                             1 tenth part.

10 tenth parts                                            1 grain.

1000 grains                                               1 imperial inch.

The grail), being subdivided into tenths and hundredths for very delicate purposes,

and its decimal multiples the 10 grains, the 100 grains, and the 1000 grains or
imperial ounce, will be used exclusively for weighing and pricing all valuable articles
to which troy weight is now applied, to the entire exclusion also of pearl weight,

diamond weight, and all the carat weights.

For apothecaries" weight, to which troy weight is also applied in preparing medical

prescriptions, and which requires the use of the grain as well as of the ounce, the
difference between the present and the proposed new grain and imperial ounce are

not worth noticing.

    Barrels and casks of various denominations, as well as sieves, baskets, sacks, boxes,
and other packages, now designating special quantities or weights of beer, wine, fruit,

coi'u, and other goods, together with the various customary loads, lasts and weys, all

differing from each other, not to be used as measures or weights without specifying

the contents or the amounts of each in cubic feet or pounds weight, as may be.

                                     Measures of Temperature and Air.
   For determining the new standard measures of length and of weight proposed, 62░"6
of Fahrenheit's thermometer, or its equivalent 17░ of Celsius's, were recommended,
with the barometer standing at 29*4 inches of the new measure. The author suggests,
that the last mentioned thermometer, which is established in France, and which has
its zero at the freezing-point, the only invariable point of temperature in nature, shall

be adopted in preference to Fahrenheit's*.
   If the foregoing suggestions, or any system on the same principle, for simplifying

our national measures and weights, should be adopted, the fine idea, generally supposed
to have been intended in Magna Charta, and most clearly and unequivocally expressed,
in one of our ancient laws of a subsequent date, but which has never yet been realized
in this country, will be literally accomplished, namely, that there shall be only one
MEASURE AND ONE WEIGHT THROUGHOUT ALL THE LANOf.

   * He is also of opinion, that it would be desirable to ascertain the length of the seconds'
pendulum by experiments in air, on the first floor of the new Houses of Parliament, in refer-
ence to the mean level of the tides in the Thames, without attempting to reduce it to the level

of the sea in a vacuum, by theoretical corrections, of which subsequent experience has rendered
the accuracy doubtful. The new experiments now suggested might be carried on in September,
during the recess of Parliament, when the above-mentioned temperature might easily be
obtained, and the state of air corrected, by ascending or descending from the given spot to a

different level.

                 v. New Monetauy System proposed.

   10 farthings                       1 cent.

   10 cents or 100 farthings          1 florin.

   10 florins, 100 cents, or 1000 farthings. . . 1 pound sterling.

   Setting aside all the new coins, proposed by him in his first publication of 1834,
except the tenth of the pound (since called the florin) and the silver cent, and setting
aside also his attempt to simplify the monetary system therein proposed, in the paper
read to the British Association at Oxford in 1847, which he admits was by no means
an improvement, the author now thinks, that the only new coin that ought to be
issued, is the silver cent, and that no silver coin greater than the florin should be
coined in future, gradually withdrawing all the crowns and half-crowns still in circu-
lation, as soon as florins to an equal amount can be issued from the Mint to replace

them.

   When any sum of money of the new coinage is written in sterling money, the last

figure or unit of the pound should always have a point after it, the three next figures
to which will designate florins, cents, and farthings, whether having these denomina-
tions written over them or not; but more than three such figures must never be used.

   He is also of the opinion, now adopted by the Council of the Decimal Association,
of which he is a member, that instead of coining new copper mils, or tithings as he
called them at first, it will be much better to declare by royal proclamation, that the

farthing shall be the tenth part of the cent, and the thousandth part of a pound, or to
make it so by Act of Parliament ; but it does not appear to him to be necessary to
withdraw any of the smaller silver coins, such as the threepenny and fourpenny
silver pieces, which, though not known when he first published, have been a very

great convenience to the public, and which none of the woi'king classes ever mistake
for one another, even in the dark, nor will they confound any of them with the new

silver cent proposed.

   The silver cent should be stamped with the words, one cent or ten farthings;
the present sixpenny pieces need not be called in ; but when more are required, let
them be stamped with the words one half shilling. In like manner, when more
fourpenny pieces are required, let them be stamped i of a shilling, and when more
threepenny pieces are required, let them be stamped i of a shilling. To add any-
thing more would be superfluous.

   The author then treats of the " difficulties urged as objections to the decimal coinage
proposed," points out the advantages of the new system proposed, and urges objec-

tions to the French metrical system.

       Aphoristic Notes on Sanitary Statistics of Workhouses and Charitable

                             Institutions. By M. Roth, M.D.

  A1 number of adult disabled persons are kept year after year in workhouses ot

charitable institutions, and very little or nothing is done to improve or cure their
chronic ailments.

  A2. number of constitutionally weak infants and children are in the workhouse

who could be cured or considerably improved.
   3. The expenses of the parish and charitable institutions would be, in the course of

years, considerably diminished by a better state of health amongst the poorer classes.
   4. Jt is necessary to have detailed statistics of the sanitary condition of the work-

houses and charitable institutions, and, if possible, of those who receive permanent or

periodical outdoor relief; and, as such returns do not exist,
    5. I have proposed the following as a specimen of a sanitary statistic table, which,

by the kindness of a poor-law guardian, was returned with the numbers showing the
actual sanitary state of one of the metropolitan suburban workhouses.

   I have proposed the classification of ages in a different way ; but as all the inmates
of workhouses are divided according to the scale shown in the Table, the actual work-
house classification has been retained.
--150 REPORT 1856.
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  151

   Such a sanitary state, as exhibited by the preceding Tables, cannot exist without great
loss of life and without considerable expense to the community at large, and the fol-
lowing are a few suggestions to remedy this bad state of health amongst the poorer

classes.

   6. All constitutionally weak children of several parishes should be brought into a
union sanatorium, where all the available hygienic and medical means, according to the
present state of science, should be used, and the education of the children continued,
as far as their weakly state permits ; when healthy, these children might be sent to the

union or charity school.
   7. The curable adult disabled paupers suffering from chronic affections should be

also visited, for the sake of cure or improvement.

   8. The expenses for the cure of such paupers would not be much more than the

expenses of the workhouse, where such paupers are frequently kept for years in con-
sequence of their having been neglected at a time when their health could have been

restored.

   9. In order to prevent the increase of the number of disabled paupers, it is most
important that the health of the healthy inmates should be kept up to the highest
standard, for which purpose the masters and matrons of workhouses, as well as all
schoolmasters and schoolmistresses, should have an elementary, popular, and practical
knowledge of the injurious and beneficial influences affecting health. This sanitary
knowledge should be imparted to the children, whose bodily faculties should be deve-

loped simultaneously with their mental faculties.
    10. This sanitary knowledge should form a part of the instruction in the training

schools of schoolmasters and schoolmistresses, of whom we cannot expect that they

should bestow more care on the preservation of the health of their pupils so long as
they are entirely ignorant on the subject ; the preservation of individual health depends
upon the parents and schoolmasters, but not on the medical man, who enters on his
duties, in the great majority of cases, only after those of the educator have been

neglected.

    11. The importance of a large garden or play-ground, as an indispensable part of a
workhouse, has been sufficiently advocated and proved by the condition of those schools

and workhouses which are not sufBciently provided in this respect.
    J 2. The kitchen fire in workhouses and charitable institutions can, by the aid of hot

water or steam, provide the necessary warmth in the various apartments, and sufficient
warm water or steam for baths, which are most important in preserving health, in cut-

--ting short many diseases at the beginning, or in curing them when developed.
     Conclusion. It is most important not only to diminish the amount of ill-health at
present existing among our poor population, but we must prevent, as far as it depends
upon ourselves, all the causes artificially producing disease and deteriorating the
general health : the number of inmates of our workhouses would thus considerably
decrease, and a diminution of poor's-rate would go hand-in-hand with the improved

 health of the paupers.

  On the Territorial Distribution of the Population, for purposes of Sanitary

         Inquiry and Social Economy. By H. W. Rtjmsey, F.R.C.S.

   1. If opportunities are now rarely afforded to States to group their populations on
scientific principles, to determine the most salutary and beneficial sites for human

habitation, and to combine the sites so occupied in well-contrived districts for statis-

--tical inquiry and local management, it cannot be denied that the past neglect of

governments, and the mistakes of private or associated enterprise, in the selection of

--places for migration and colonization, have led to most fatal results, to enormous

sacrifice of life, to immense national and personal loss, and to sad degradation of race.
    2. Correct principles of locajization are not easily applied to old communities, yet

the difficulties in the way of are-adjustment of territorial divisions, even in this country,
are not insuperable. The mobility of the population of England has undergone some
striking variations since the Conquest. Many causes and great facilities existed for

gveat changes are now in rapid progress ; and the obstacles to an amended distribution

of the hihabitants are fast disappearing.

   3. During the fii-st half of tliis century, a much larger proportion of the population
aggregated in towns ; but now a reflux of population from crowded centres is again
taking place. Suburban inhabited areas are accordingly increasing in a greater ratio
than the numbers of town residents.

    4. Past legislation has limited political privileges to crowded populations within
narrow boundaries, and has thus fostered the injurious condensation of the masses.
It is important to reverse this policy, and to treat the whole population on equal

terms.

    5. The old divisions of the country, various and conflicting, are inapplicable to the
progressive extension of inhabited areas. Changes have accordingly been found
necessary in parochial and municipal boundaries, which cannot therefore be considered
 of a settled or permanent nature.

    G. The recent division of the country into poor-law Unions was based on the paro-
chial system, and like it, is irreconcileable with municipal boundaries. Unions were
not formed scientifically ; and they often manifest, in their form and contents, singular
 inattention to physical geography and sanitary considerations.

    7. The registration districts, and (now) the census arrangements, are based on the
 poor-law division, and the returns of population, births, deaths, and marriages, have
made the defects of that division more obvious, while an erroneous distribution of the
people has, in turn, afiected the compilation of vital and sanitary statistics, so that
 these returns do not afford, to the extent which they might, the means for correct
 inferences respecting the physical condition and social progress of distinct communities,

 in special circumstances, natural or artificial.

    For this, among other valid reasons, it is unsafe to adopt the rate of mortality in
 any union or registration district, as a test of the actual salubrity, either of its principal
 town or of its more scattered population.

    8. Until our national records of vital statistics are more complete (including facts
 now omitted) and compiled from a more scientific classification of the people, we can
 arrive at no satisfactory conclusions respecting the life, the health, the social state,
 the education, the morals and the habits of those who inhabit difl^erent places ; we are
 unable to demonstrate the causes of social evils, and therefore we cannot fairly call
 upon the legislature to inaugurate the required reforms.

     9. Another obstacle to a correct territorial division for statistical objects, is the co-
 existence of several kinds of local administrative bodies, exercising conflicting functions,
 within difierent areas ofjurisdiction. Various administrative duties, of a sanitary or
 reformatory nature, are performed in most towns by two rival bodies (a Board of

 Guardians and a Town Council or Local Board of Health) managing districts which

 differ widely in extent ; the vital statistics being collected under the authority of that
 local board which has been the most distrusted as regards sanitary management.

    10. The practical evils of limited and isolated jurisdictions, in the execution of

--measures of public health, are manj' and serious, evils to the inhabitants included,

 and evils to those excluded.
     11. It is of paramount importance to extend sanitary inspection and regulation to

 suburban and rural districts. The outskirts of towns are more and more peopled by
 the humbler classes of society ; and it is therefore increasingly necessary to promote
 a better description of dwellings for working people out of towns, either near railway

  stations, or within accessible distance of their places of labour.
     12. Measures of public health should be extended to the whole population of the

 kingdom, without reference to any district-rate of mortality. It is absui'd to defer

--the application of preventive measures, until the fatal result of neglect, namely, a high

 proportion of deaths, the precise ratio of which different parties cannot agree upon,

--be detected in any place.

    No13. system of territorial division, for statistical purposes and for local self-govern-

 ment, deserves consideration, which would not secure for every portion of the country,
 whether town or rural parish, the superintendence of a uniform administi-ative ma-
 chinery, competent to collect all returns relating to the numbers, the vital force (ages
 of the living), the mortality, the diseases, and the reproduction ofc he population,
 as well as to carry into effect all sanitary precautions.

   A14. public registration of diseases should have special regard to their causation,

                                                                                                  ;

logy, and of the varying conditions of the animal and vegetable kingdoms (agricul-

tural statistics) should be concurrently made in each superior registration district. And

these combined observations and records in each locality should be published periodi-

cally for the instruction of its inhabitants.

   15. Again, the law should no longer confer badly-defined powers upon two or more
rival boards in the same place. If each of the existing local boards and councils were

--fairly represented in a superior court, with a larger jurisdiction than now belongs to

any of those bodies, as the district boards of London are in its metropolitan board,

all reasonable objections to a transfer^of local functions might be avoided.
   16. As to the extent and form of the proposed larger districts for collecting and

registering vital and social statistics and for local management (the jurisdiction of

the Metropolitan Board of Works being wholly excluded from present considerations),

each might contain, on the average, two or more parochial unions.
   Wherever a correction of existing boundaries might be deemed necessary, the

natural features of the locality should be carefully borne in mind ; each parish or
cluster of population being included in that district, the pi-incipal town of which would

be most easy of access; and special regard being had to density of population.

17. Every sanitary jurisdiction should be provided with a superintending officer of

health, debarred from private professional engagements, and performing a variety of

most important public functions*.

   And such sanitary jurisdictions should be an exact aggregate of a sufficient number

of smaller districts for medical visitation, which should be either identical with the

registration sub-districts or subdivisions of them.

18. Recapitulation of practical suggestions.

(a.) The physical geography of the district, and the general character of its popula-

tion, should be the main facts upon which any revision of existing territorial divisions

should be founded.

(b.) Areas for statistical returns should invariably be co-extensive with those for

sanitary management.

(c.) The extent of these areas should be large enough to provide satisfactorily for

the amalgamation of existing smaller jurisdictions.
   (d.) They should also be large enough to secure, with economy, the appointment

of a superior class of superintending Registrars, as officers of health.

All these changes might be effected without any offensive sacrifice of existing in-

terests, or violation of justly established rights.

On the Progress, Extent, and Value of the Porcelain, Earthenware, and Glass
          Manufacture of Glasgow. By John Strang, LL.D., F.S.S.

    At the last meeting of the British Association I had the honour of bringing before
this Section a paper on the progress, extent, and value of the coal and iron trade of the
west of Scotland, of which Glasgow is the central mart ; and I now have the pleasure
of presenting you with the past and present position of certain other modern branches
of industry, which, although not so great as the former, have tended to give an onward
impulse to that progressive city : I allude to the manufacture of porcelain, earthenware,
glass, and tobacco-pipes. Although the making of delft or stoneware in its rudest
style and forms, and the manufacture of porcelain in somewhat better taste, were

-- --there early introduced the one in 1748 and the other in 1766 the whole actual

value of both these articles made during the year 1777 amounted only to Б5000; and

--although the manufacture of black bottles and flint-glass was begun the one in 1730
--and the other in 1777 the export of the former from the Clyde during the year 1777

merely reached 4760 cwts., and of the latter to little more than 14 cwts. The fact is,
till within these thirty years, there was only one pottery, one flint-glass, and one bottle-
work in the city of Glasgow. The trade in all these articles may therefore be said to
be but of yesterday, when it is stated that there are now eight large potteries engaged
in the manufacture of all kinds of china, porcelain, parian, and other ware, four flint-
glass manufactories, and twelve bottle-houses, with a considerable number of manu-

factories of ornamental vases, chimney-tops, gas retorts, drain- and water-pipes, fire-
bricks, figures and fountains from fire-clay, and several very extensive works, wholly
engaged in the production of coarse earthenware, sugar moulds, and drips and chim-
ney caps from the red clay of the district. For the purpose of exhibiting more palpa-
bly and clearly the present extent and importance of this almost new branch of manu-
facture in Glasgow, the following statistical facts have been obtained, which cannot
fail to prove the rapid rise of this important department. During the year 1854 the
eight manufactories of porcelain and earthenware imported and used 7805 tons of clays
from Dorset, Devon, and Cornwall, 1240 tons of Cornish stone, and 2850 tons of flints,
employing in all 11,895 tons of shipping, while in these works were consumed about
50,000 tons of coals. The number of persons employed during the same period,
consisting of men, boys, and girls, were 2000, who, on an average, gained 12s. per
week of wages ; making an aggregate of Б62,400 paid to workpeople in the Glasgow
potteries during the twelvemonth. The total value of this branch may be fairly esti-
mated at Б120,000, while the quantity exported in 1854 from the Clyde amounted to
4,931,166 pieces. At first sight it might be supposed that a manufacture which requires
to draw such heavy products as clays, flints, and Coi-nish stone fi'om so great a distance
would be disaclvantageously placed as to profit. But as respects this, Glasgow is not
less favourably situated than the great seat of the porcelain manufacture in England,
Staffordshire; while in regard to the price of fuel, and the ready means of conveyance to
all parts of the world, it is even more advantageously placed. In the manufacture of

porcelain, however, there are a vast variety of articles required, in addition to clays
and flints. As a somewhat curious picture of the variety of articles which enter into

the manufacture of porcelain, we find the following rather long list used in a Glasgow
pottery employing 315 persons:

Blue clay                  600 tons.                                                                      Tar used with colour .            30 galls.

Б16,000, and the whole value of the branch being about Б40,000, while the quantity

exported from the Clyde amounted to 2262 cwt. From the twelve bottle-houses which,

during 1851, employed 400 workers, there were produced bottles to the extent of

--208,000 cwt., or 14,992,667 bottles the value of the branch in 1854 being about

Б104,000. The amount of wages paid was Б31,200 ; and the export from the Clyde

90,430 cwt.
    In the manufacture of tobacco-pipes, there has of late years been perhaps a greater

proportional advance than in that of porcelain or glass. This is a handicraft which

may be said to belong peculiarly to Glasgow, being carried on to a far greater extent
there than in any other part of the country. Within little more than twenty years,

there were not above fifty persons employed in this manufacture in that city, and at
-- ----

                       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                       155

this moment there are no fewer than 600 persons, who work up 2740 tons of clay, and
who manufacture, finish, and pack about 2700 gross of pipes per day, and whose wages
amount for each person employed to about 20s. yer week. The whole value of this
manufacture may amount to Б44,000.

    Assuming, then, all these statements to be as correct as they probably can be made^
let us see what the gross value of these branches are in twelve months :

Value of porcelain                                    j6120,000

Value of flint-glass                                  40,000

Value of bottles                                      104,000

Value of tobacco-pipes                                44,000

We find, also, from the foregoing statements, that the number of persons employed

in these branches, and the wages paid, during one year, were as follows :

Employed in porcelain and earthenware manufactories,

2000, at 12s. per week                                Б62,400

Employed in flint-glass works, 323                    16,000

Employed in bottle works, 400, at 30s. per week. . . 31,200

Employed in tobacco-pipe manufactories, COO, at 20s. . 31,200

In short, the foregoing Tables show that the porcelain, glass, bottle, and tobacco-pipe
manufactories in Glasgow, produce at present an annual value of Б288,000, and give
employment to 3323 persons, who receive for their labour wages to the amount of

Б140,800.

   The rapid progress which these several manufactures have made in Glasgow may
be chiefly attributed to the demand which the foreign trade of the Clyde has created
for bulky freight, and which the following Table, showing the number and tonnage of

the vessels employed in the foreign trade at the harbour of Glasgow alone, will best

illustrate :           Number of Vessels.             Tonnage.
                                   716                  176,441

                 1852              760                 221,139
                 1853

1854 878 245,062

1855 756 212,913

   It is well known that Liverpool has long enjoyed, through the manufacturers of
Staffordshire, the desideratum of bulky freight; and no sooner had Glasgow become,
as it has only done within twenty years, an increasing harbour for vessels trading to
every quarter of the globe, than it was found, that while she could furnish abundance of
heavy freight in the shape of pig, malleable iron, and coal, she was deficient in such
bulky articles as coarse earthenware, common porcelain, flint, and bottle glass and
china to fill up the space unoccupied by finer goods. It is probable, therefore, that
the manufactures whose progress we have been attempting to illustrate will go on in-
creasing with the increase of foreign commerce, and that the increase of these will in
future be chiefly excited and marked by the increasing tonnage employed in the
foreign trade from the harbour of Glasgow and the other lower ports of the Clyde.

On the Money-rate of Wages of Labour in Glasgow and the West of Scotland.
                            By John Strang, LL.D., F.S.S.

   A correct chronicle of wages, as applied to differentkinds of manufactures and hand-
crafts, combined with the changing cost of the necessaries and even the common
luxuries of life, would form one of the most valuable contributions to economic science.
While the rate of these would at once mark the advance or fall on the value of labour
at particular epochs, it would, at the same time, note the changes which have taken
place in the value of labour as applied to particular distinct handicrafts; and if the
money-rate were further measured by the cost of the great necessaries of existence,
would give a pretty clear insight into the social condition of the labourer at any period
of the country's history. As a humble contribution to this chronicle of labour, 1 have
now to present you witli a comparative statement of the rate of wages in one of the
most important of tlie labour marts of Great Britain, I mean the City of Glasgow and
its neighbourhood; and for this purpose I shall select, from the long list of mechanics,

general are based on returns made to me by some of the leading manufacturers,

engineers, ironmasters, and builders of the city and surrounding district, and that they

concerns to which they apply. Let us commence with the cotton-spinners and power-

loom weavers, of whom in the West of Scotland, Glasgow is the central mart, and

whose numbers amount at present to about 30,000. It appears the average wages of
those persons were as follows at the three different periods of 1841, 1851, and 1856:

--Power-loom weavers average per week            1841. 1851.                                                              1856.
--Cotton-spinners average per week                 7s. 7s. 3d.                                                           8s. 3d.
                                                                                                                        20s. to 35s.
                                                 21s. 2ls. Od.

From these figures, it appears that the wages in this department of manufactures have
been gradually rising since 1841. While this has been generally the case, it may

however be remarked that not more but even less has been paid for weaving for each

piece of cloth, and for spinning each hank of yarn. In the case of cotton-spinners in

particular, matters have so changed, and mills and machines have been so altered in

productive power, that it is almost impossible to arrive at a correct average of wages

at present paid : for while in the older factories a spinner cannot gain more than
20s. a week, in the new mills, possessing all the advai;tages of improved machinery,

his wages may even reach 35s. In the one a man manages 500 spindles, whereas in
another he can superintend 1500 or 2000. In proof of this I may mention that five

and thirty 3'ears ago the spinner of the finest or highest numbers of yarn had only

about 150 spindles to each jenny to attend to, whereas now in the factories where the

finest numbers of yarns are spun, one individual can easily manage 880 spindles, and

these two are annually on the increase. In short, in cotton-spinning and power-loom

weaving the advance of wages has arisen principally from increased production in conФ

sequence of improvements in machinery. It must also be kept in mind that weavers

and spinners worked 69 hours in 1841 and only 60 in 1851, and hence received more

money for less labour.

Let us next advert to the wages of two of the most important manufactures of the

West of Scotland, I mean the rates obtained by the workmen employed in mines and

iron- works, whose numbers in the year 1854-55 amounted to 33,900, and whose united

wages during these twelve months reached the large sum of ^1,976,000. Average

rate of mining labour for the last five years:

From the foregoing statements, it appears that there has been a gradual but important

rise in the wages of those employed in the coal and ironstone mines, as well as of those

employed in the manufacture  of pig and  malleable iron                                                                 in the former, from 2s. Gd.

men connected with these several departments is remembered, being nearly 34,000,
such a rise cannot fail to involve most important consequences. The third point to

--which we would call attention, is the wages of engineers and mechanics a very large

class of workers in Glasgow and its neighbourhood. The following is the average

rate of engineers' wages per day (of ten hours) during the last six years :

              1851                                  Shillings.
              1852
              1853                                    3-43
              1854                                    3-52
              1855                                    3-82
              1856                                    3-97
                                                      3-99
                                                      4

   From the foregoing Table it is quite plain that the wages paid to engineers and
mechanics during these last six years have been progressively advancing, and shows

since 1851 to the present time a rise of about 14 per cent.

   The fourth subject to which we would allude is that of building, or house con-
struction. In so growing a city as Glasgow, which, with its suburbs, has a population
at present of not less than 400,000, and whose rate of inci-ease from births over deaths
and immigration amounts annually to about 3f per cent., it is easy to conceive how very
large the employment must be of those engaged in this business. Of the many
handicraftsmen engaged in constructing houses, warehouses, and other buildings, we

shall, however, limit ourselves to stone quarriers, masons, carpenters, and labourers.

   The following is the rate of wages paid to quarriers from 1851 to 1856 :

      1851                      16s. per week of 60 hours.

      1852                      16s.                ,,         ,,

      18.53                     19s.                ,,         ,,
                                20s.                ,,         ,,
      1854                      22s.                ,,         ,,
      1855
      1856

Or a rise of 6s. per week, or about 37 per cent., since 1851.

The following is the average rate paid to masons :

                                                    Per week.

,, ,,               1853                            23s. 9c?., i^th less in winter.

,,,,                1856                            25s.               ,,
                                                    25s.               ,,

   For the last three years masons have restricted themselves to 57 hours' work per week;
previous to this, they worked 60 hoin-s ; and there is a prevalent feeling among this
class of craftsmen still further to reduce the hours of labour.

   The following is the rate of the wages paid to carpenters and joiners, from 1850 to
1 855 inclusive :

1850 (average during year)      21s. 6d. per week of 60 hours.

or an advance of 2s. 6d. per week, with a reduction during the last two years of
the series of three hours on the week's work. At the present moment the rate of
wages paid to carpenters and joiners is 5d. per hour for whatever time they are
working, without reference to weeks ; but the stated time is 57 hours per week, or
23s. 9d. per week; or, should they work the day of 10 hours, 4s. 2d. per day. This
shows the advance on the wages of this handicraft to have been 4s. 6d. per week.

   The following is the rate of wages paid to common labourers, connected with all

matters of house construction :

Thus the rise has been greater on unskilled than even skilled labour, being 5s., or

upwards of 40 per cent.   These labourers  are  almost  exclusively                                  Irish                         and,  strange  to
                                                                                                                                ;

say, that while in the north of Ireland, within 30 miles of Belfast, labourers can be got

from Is. to Is. 6d. per day, or 6s. to 9s. per week, with the cost of transit per steam to

Glasgow of from 2s. 6d. to 4s., the flow of Irish immigration to Glasgow has greatly

diminished.

   It would be easy for me to multiply examples of the advance which has taken
place in the rate of wages from almost every class of workmen during the last five
years, an advance which has now reached the long sinking employment of the hand-

loom weaver. For a long period the position of those connected with this last
employment had been gradually lowering, till at length it became pitiful indeed.
The facility with which the art can be learned, the numbers which unfortunately
rushed to this work, frequently creating an equal competition between the man and
the child, coupled with the competition of power-loom labour, are assuredly some

of the causes which have produced the great fall during these thirty years past in this

species of handicraft. But whatever the causes may have been for sinking the value

of hand-loom labour, it can scarcely be denied that the average rate of weekly wages,

as furnished me by two or three of the leading manufacturing houses in Glasgow,

being at present from 6s. to 7s. Id. per week, is indeed a miserable pittance even
when measured by the reduced prices which have taken place in every article of
consumption and clothing since J 825, when (he wages was 13s. 6f/. per week. The
following is a progressive statement of the average wages earned by the hand-
loom weavers from 1825, marking the periods when the reductions took place :

     1825                     13s. 6d.          1848                                                      6s. Od.
     1827                      9s. 0^.          1851                                                      5s. 8d.
     1829                       7s. 6d.         1852                                                      6s. 9c?.
     1831                      6s. 6d.          1853                                                      7s. Od.
     1834                      8s. 0Ф^.         1856                                                      7s. Od.
     1837                       7s. 0<^.

It will be observed from the foregoing statement, that the late advance in wages has

even reached those miserably paid workmen, the wages in 1851 being 5s. 8c?. per

week, whereas, in 1856, the average is 7s. Id. It is gratifying to state that the hand-

loom weavers are fast diminishing in Glasgow, although in the villages and

towns around they still maintain their numbers. That they should do so, is

at first sight surprising, when other branches of manufacture offer such high
иwages for labour. There is, however, some compensation to the hand-loom weaver

--which the factory workman and the artisan do not enjoy I allude to the feeling

that they are their own masters, can work short or long, late or early, in the garden

--or in the shop, and that without any detriment to their web that they can employ

their wives and children either as adjuncts or assistants in their own labour, and can
thus eke out a tolerable subsistence without the restraints imposed on many of their

more money-gaining brethren.

   The deduction which may be gathered from the foregoing statements and figures is

--simply this : That during the last five or six years a gradual and permanent rise seems

tohave been established in allwages connected with the leadingmanufacturesofGlasgow,

and  we may almost  add,  throughout  Great Britain  and  Ireland                                    and  that,                    too,  even     in
                                                                                                  ;

the face of the reduction which has been made in the hours of labour. And were we

to carry the inquiry further, and place in a comparative table the price of the chief
articles of consumption which enter into the domestic economy of the artisan and

labourer, since the period when the policy of this country was directed, to relieve not

only all the great necessaries of life from fiscal burdens, but to reduce, as far as pos-

sible, the duties exigible on those articles of luxury, such as tea, sugar, cofiee, &c.,

--иwhich more particularly enter into the consumption of the labouring classes ; it may be

fairly affirmed that this most important body of the community is at the present mo-

ment placed in a more enviable position in the social scale than they were ever for*

merly in this country, or are perhaps to be found in any quarter of the globe. From
the foregoing facts, and from the results of the policy pursued by the Government, it
is quite certain that the industrious man never knew a period in which, if he could only
be temperate and frugal, he might more easily save money ; and could he only be
induced to eschew the whisky shop, and turn his footsteps to the Savings' Bank, he
would speedily find himself more comfortable, independent, and happy, tlian the mass
of his fellow-labourers, whose increased means are but too frequently devoted to the

gratification of the grosser passions of humanity.

On some Statistics bearing upon the Relations existing between Poverty and

                          Crime. By W. M. Tartt, M.S. A.

   After alluding to the crimes committed by those who were in the enjoyment not
merely of competence but of luxury, Mr. Tartt contended, that, although poverty might
be a predisposing state, it was rarely an immediate cause of crime till it became allied
with drunkenness and ignorance. It was proved by prison returns from the manufac-
turing districts of Lancashii-e, that crime had increased during periods of prosperity,
and diminished (sometimes to the extent of 40 per cent.) in immediately succeeding
periods of adversity plenty leading to vicious indulgence, while poverty was the severe

                                                                                          ;

teacher of economy and restraint. In addition to the more minute details furnished
by the chaplain of the County-House of Correction at Preston (the Rev. Vi. Clay), and
quoted in the paper now read, it was shown by the reports of the chief constable for
Manchester, that the committals and summary convictions in that borough for the
prosperous years 1844-45 were 10,436, and that ibr the two years of distress which
followed, they were only 7635. It seemed admitted by all who came in contact with
the administration of criminal law, that the two great causes of crime amongst the
lower classes are drunkenness and ignorance ; and it was shown by the returns which
were now before them, that the greater proportion of the crimes committed were directly
or indirectly to be traced to drunkenness. At the assizes for Lancashire in the year
ending March 1 854, out of 380 of the worst cases, 250 (including 9 murders) were
traceable to this vice. Much of it is the result of ignorance, and of the consequent
inaptitude to find amusement in better things. To show the extent to which it pre-
vails, it was stated that of the male prisoners who came under the notice of Mr, Clay
in 1 853 and 1 854, 1088 (or 41 per cent, of the whole) were incapable of reading at all
938 (or 36 per cent.) were unable to repeat the Lord's prayer with any approach to
accuracy in the words or proper comprehension of their meaning; and 1836 (or 72
per cent.) were unable to understand the import of the plainest language necessary to
convey instruction in moral and religious truth. The Liverpool police returns showed
a similar result ; and they pretty nearly confirmed the calculations of Mr. Porter for an
average of thirteen years from 1836-1848. They cannot be taken as evidence on the
general question of education: they merely refer to the connexion between ignorance
and crime. The remedy was our great difficulty. One of the judges (Mr. Justice
Wightman) had more than once declared his belief, " that drunkenness would ultimately

be eradicated by moral and religious instruction. He did not depend so much upon

the knowledge acquired, as upon the habit of disciphne and self-restraint consequent
upon better education ; and the creation of a tone of self-respect which might ope-
rate as a check upon disgraceful or degrading conduct." Something might also be
eflPected by example. The lower classes were, at times, encouraged in their vices by
the conduct of those above them ; and as temperance has now been substituted for
debasing excesses in the one, the same change may, before long, be witnessed in the
other. But, above all, we should endeavour to get rid of the monstrous anomaly of
raising revenue from the vices of the people ; for whatever may be shown by tabulated
returns, we cannot but believe that the establishment of beer-houses has been the
greatest incentive to crime that was ever sanctioned by legislative enactment.

   It is, under every aspect, one of the most important questions to which our attention

can be directed.

    A Deduction from the Statistics of Crime for the last Ten Years.

                       By Professor R. H. Walsh, LL.D.

A theory has lately grown up, that when the people suffer privation they refrain from

crime, but fall into excesses when prosperity returns. This notion, opposed to the
malesuada fames of the poet, isbasSd on some criminal statistics, principally composed
of the records of summary convictions in a few localities. But it is not fair to esti-
mate the morality of a nation by the number of petty offences committed in one or
two districts, or even throughout the entire country. The returns of the summary
convictions before magistrates do not afford a correct test either of the number of
prohibited acts committed, or of the guilt of the perpetrators. Most of the offences
which swell these returns are of a most trivial character; and at one time the acts
which constitute such offences are committed with impunity, while at another the
excessive vigilance of the police and over-energy of the public in the assertion of their
rights, let nothing escape. But even if these alternate fits of remissness and zeal (the
necessary consequences of the petty nature and trivial character of the offences in
question) did not occur, and the summary convictions afforded a true representation
of the quantinn of prohibited acts committed, the test they furnish must be objected
to. The accurate measure of crime is to be found in the returns of offences sent for
trial to assizes and quarter sessions. These are usually of a serious and well-defined
character ; and for that very reason, the acts which constitute them are rarely committed
without being made the subject of legal investigation. These are the returns to be
employed in measuring the morality of a nation, and they should not be mixed up
with the summary convictions. To do so is to be guilty of the absurdity of confound-
ing together, as if they were on a footing of equality, the most serious offences and
trifling misdemeanors, and placing in the same category with the robber and the
murderer the man who slights the dignity of a policeman, heedlessly offends an irasci-
ble wayfarer, or happens to drive on the wrong side of the road. The returns of the
committals for trial at assizes and quarter sessions in England and Wales from 1 844 to
1854 (the last year for wliich they have been published), show clearly that crime
increases when the physical condition of the people deteriorates, and vice versa.
In 1844 the number of committals was 26,542; in 1845, 24,303; 1846, 25,107;
1847,28,833; 1848,30,349; 1849, 27,816; 1850,26,813; 1851,27,960; 1852,
27,510 ; 1853, 27,057 ; and in 1854, 29,359. The first year in which the committals
increased is 1 847, a year of distress ; the rise then being nearly 4000. This rise was
maintained with an addition of nearly 1500 in 1848, likewise a year of distress, partly
owing to the same causes as in 1847, and partly on account of political disturbances
and apprehensions. In 1849, the causes which before had depressed the condition of
the labourer died away. Food was cheap and employment abundant. Emigra-
tion had removed many of the working classes, and those who remained at home found
the demand for their services increased ; and in that year we find the committals de-
cline by nearly 2500. The succeeding years were likewise seasons of prosperity, and
during these the criminal returns exhibit no marked fluctuation. In the last year of
the series, the number of committals rose by a little over 2000, but at the same
time the condition of the people was impaired owing to the enhanced price of food and
other necessaries of life, and also to the waste of the national resources and partial
derangement of trade occasioned by the war. It may be observed in conclusion, that,
if the number of committals in 1844 was but 26,542 and in 1854 29,359, the popula-
tion had increased in the interval in a greater proportion. The criminal returns for
 Ireland tell a similar tale, when we take into account the changes experienced in the
physical condition of the people. Indeed, the lesson is the more instructive from the
fact of the changes in the condition of the people having been greater than those ex-
 perienced in England, so that the corresponding fluctuations in crime exhibit more
 strongly the marked connexion between the two. During the years of distress the
committals rose to over 40,000, and when prosperity visited the land they fell to less
than a fourth of that number. The returns of the summary convictions (as might be
 expected) do not exhibit in their fluctuations any constant relation to the changes in
 the physical condition of the people; but, as far as they go, they more frequently
 follow the same than an opposite course to that of the other criminal returns. So
 much for the results of the statistics of summary convictions, the class of offences fronr
 which it had been inferred that poverty and privation are conducive to popular
 morality. But, taking the statistics of real and formidable offences, we arrive at the more
 agreeable conclusion, that, when the people are comfortable, they are well-conducted
 while it is only when they suffer privation, that a general increase of crime takes place

On the Present Export of Silver to the East. By Prof. R. H. Walsh, LL.D.

    So far back as the time when Pliny termed it the sink of the precious metals, silver
was a favourite article of export to the East. It has continued so since ; but the trade

of late has assumed an extraordinary magnitude. In tlie five years prior to the present
over Б22,000,000 worth of silver have been exported (o the East through England
alone, and from other countries a similar movement has been in operation. The
export in 1855 was Б6,400,000; and this year it is proceeding at the rate of over
Б9,000,000 per annum, judging from the returns that have been published for the first
four months. Unlike the old movement, the pi'eaent cannot be permanent. The
former was seldom more than might be accounted for as the distribution of silver to

-- --some of its chief consumers the nations of the East according as new supplies were

raised elsewhere. It was, in fact, the ordinary movement from the producer to the
consumer. But now silver goes faster to the East than it is produced throughout the
world. Hence the process cannot be permanent, but must come to an end as soon

as the re-distribution of the old stock has been effected ; for the annual production of
silver is only about Б8,000,000, and since the export to the East through England
alone is at the rate of over Б9,000,000, it follovps that it cannot be the new supplies of
silver which meet that demand and all others for the same metal, but there must be
some auxiliary fund to be drawn upon. Such a fund is furnished by a cessation in
the demand for silver in several countries which before employed it most largely, but

now use gold instead. In a paper brought before this Association at Glasgow last
September, I had occasion to notice that silver, which used to be coined in France and
the United States at an average rate of Б4,000,000 per annum, is now little employed,
while much of the old coin of that metal is melted down and exported. In France, it
is said, that in one year, 1853, so much as ,Б12,000,000 was disposed of in this man-
ner, and that the operation has since been pi-oceeding at a still greater rate. All this
acts in the same way as if a silver California had been discovered. No one thinks it

extraordinary that gold is exported on a large scale from the auriferous regions to the
various nations which use that metal ; but it is quite as natural to suppose that when
large supplies of silver are thrown upon the market (it matters not whether newly
extracted from the earth, or just taken from the melting-pot), they would find their
way to those places where silver is generally employed. India, China, and other East-
ern nations come under this description, and hence the late extraordinary exportation.
As this cause is a novel one, there is an inclination on the part of some who call them-

selves practical men to adopt any other rather than it. Experience gives no instance
of any such, and hence those who look to their personal experience alone are completely
at fault when discussing this question. Some talk of the balance of trade; others of
an increased importation of tea and silk from China ; and a third set of investigators
enunciate details of the machinery of the foreign exchanges by which the transmission

is effected. But such persons forget that the export of silver is just as likely in the
abstract to be the cause as the effect of the "balance," or "increased importation," in
which they dogmatically assume it originated ; and that, as for the details of the foreign
exchanges, they merely tell us how and not why the export takes place. Yet all this
is said while the question presents no difficulty whatsoever, when two facts are noticed

--in juxtaposition, one, the great cessation in the demand for silver in countries which

employ a double standard ; the other, the circumstance that the Eastern nations

habituallj' use silver on a large scale, especially in their currency. After that there
is nothing to be said to complete the explanation, except to call to mind that when
the supply of any article is unusually great compared with the number of consumers,
it must find its way to these latter in quantities proportionally auj'mented; and that
such is the case at present with the article silver, the principal consumers of which

are the nations of the East.

       Concludhiff Address. By R. Monckton Milnes, M.P.

   In the absence of Lord Stanley, Mr. Monckton Milnes, a Vice-PresidentoftheSection,

gave a summary of the proceedings of the Section. He remarked on the small proportion

of papers that had been read bearing on political economy when compared with the
papers on other subjects. They were, no doubt, aware that there were French and

--162 REPORT 1856,

American economists who disputed the very fundamental principles of political economy
as laid down by Adam Smith and Ricardo, and he should be glad if the members of
the British Association would make this subject their study. In reviewing the papers,
he particularly alluded to the paper on the ' Credit Mobilier ' of France, and expressed
his fear that it would lead to the wildest speculations, such as could not occur in any
country without creating the greatest social disorganization. The Credit Mobilier
had this peculiarity, that it was not like the great commercial crises which had fallen
in our own time, which had arisen from over-employment of capital in public works
by the authors and promoters of these works ; the speculators were ruined, but the
works remained. This was not the case with the Credit Mobilier, which encouraged
speculations for the advantage of a mere body of capitalists, who, by their very system,
liberate themselves from all personal responsibility and all interest in the works under-
taken, and thus give encoui-agement to every extravagance, without even the pretence
of any permanent public utility. He believed the greatest political danger was likely
to result from evils of this kind, and hoped that British capitalists would take no part

in so unsound a system. He also commented on the papers on social subjects which

had been read, especially on those connected with the reformation of young offenders,
for which object he had brought a Bill into Parliament ten years ago, and which was
now bringing forth abundant fruit. Crime might, under certain circumstances, as had
been shown, be increased by national prosperity, but it might be diminished by moral
training and true education.

 Explorations through the Valley of the Atrato to the Pacific in search of a

             Route for a Ship-canal. By F. M. Kelley, of New York.

    Several surveying expeditions have been sent b}' Mr. Kelley into this region, and
 nuich valuable information has resulted. But the chief result is a conviction of the
feasibilit)' of a ship-canal through the isthmus. The most recent of Mr. Kelley 's ex-
plorers, Mr. Kennish, proposes to enter the Atrato by the Caiio Coquito. The great-
 est depth on the bar is about 4 ft. at low water; the soundings gradually deepen, and
become 30 ft. within 2 miles, when the depth increases to 47 ft., and is nowhere less
 up to the Truando. The width varies from a quarter of a mile to 2 miles, and the re-
moval of the bar would allow of the transit of the largest steamers. The confluence
of the Truando is about 63 miles from the Gulf, and that river forms the channel of
the proposed line for 36 miles. The line then follows the valley of the Nerqua through
rock-cutting, and )>asses the summit by a tunnel of 3^ miles. It reaches the
Pacific through the valley of a small Ktreaui, and debouches at Kelley 's Inlet. In the

valley of the Atrato, 300 miles long and 75 broad, and lying between the Antiochian
mountains on the east and the Cordillera of the Andes on the west, rain falls almost

daily, which accounts for the immense supply of water in that region. On the Pacific
side of the Cordillera there is scarcely any rain for eight months of the year. The

greater portion of the rain falling in the Atrato valley is caught above the confluence
of the Truando. Fifteen large tributaries and numerous smaller streams fall into the
Atrato and contribute to the immense lagoons, which form natural reservoirs and a
superabundant store of water throughout the year. There are various cogent reasons
for selecting the confluence of the Truando as the best point from whence the passage

from the Atrato to the Pacific may be effected. In the first place, there is no point

of junction with the Atrato by western tributaries so near the level of high water on
the Pacific as that of the Truando. It happens to be 9 ft. above the Pacific at high
water, and it is therefore of sufficient elevation to prevent the Pacific at high water

from flowing through the proposed cut into the Atrato ; while it is not so high
as to cause the current from the Atrato to the Pacific at low water to pass through the
cut too rapidly. In fact, the elevation of the Truando confluence just preserves a pre-
ponderating balance on the side of the Atrato. The Atrato, at the junction of the

Salaqui, is only 1 ft. above the level of the Pacific at high water ; but the dividing
ridge is 1063 ft. high and 30 miles wide, according to a survey of that route by Mr.
Kennish and Mr. Nelson. Should any of the rivers at the mouth of the Atrato be

selected without reference to the height and width of the dividing ridge, it may be
observed that the maximum tidal wave in the Pacific being 25 ft. and that on the

Atlantic only 2 ft., the Pacific at high tide would flow into the Atlantic with a current
equal to a head of ll^ft ; and at low water in the Pacific the Atlantic would flow into
it with a similar current. In the inlet of the Gulf of Micuel recently called Darien
Harbour, the action of the tide is so strong, that Her British Majesty's steamship ' Virago/
commanded by Capt. Prevost, dragged both anchors ahead, and was only brought up by
paying out nearly all her cable. The heights of the tides and the levels of the two oceans
have been well established by the recent observations of Col. Tolten in Navy Bay on the

Atlantic, and in a deep bend of the Bay of Panama on the Pacific. On the Atlantic a

consecutive series of thirty-two observations Were taken in the months of August and

September during the season of calms. On the Pacific two sets of observations were
made : the first during May and June, when fifty-four consecutive tides were observed
in a season of calms ; and the second in November and December, when fifty-two

consecutive tides were observed in a season of light winds. The results do not exactly
correspond, and are given in the following Table :

two oceans. The conclusions arrived at by the successive independent surveys

--carried out at the expense of Mr. Kelley may be summed up as follows : first, that

the oceans can be united through the Atrato and Truando by a canal without a lock or
any other impediment ; second, that while the distance between the oceans by this route
is only 131 miles, half that distance is provided by nature with a passage for the largest
ships ; third, the remaining distance requires the removal of bars, excavations, and
cuttings presenting no unusual difficulties ; fourth, harbours requiring but little im-
provement to render them excellent exist at the termini.

   On the Management of Mercantile Vessels. By R. Methuen, F.R.G.S.

   On a New Plan for a Ship Communicator. By Dr. Sibbald, Liverpool.

   Nothing is more common than for a ship in some position of difficulty to require
to communicate readily with adjoining land, especially with a lee shore when she
is in danger. Or it may be that two vessels require to communicate when they
cannot approach each other ; and various other sets of circumstances may arise to

 render such communication desirable or absolutely necessary.
    The following apparatus has been patented for the purpose ; and numerous ex-

periments have shown that it may be employed with great success.

   A series of four parallel hoops of wood, about two feet and a half in diameter,
are covered with patent oiled cloth so as to be impervious to water. When not in

 use, the machine lies flat, about four inches in thickness, and is less than six pounds

in weight. When required, the hoops are separated, and the machine becomes in-

 flated on the system of a pair of bellows. It forms two cylinders with a small neck
 between, the cylinders serving to produce buoyancy and to be acted upon by the
 wind ; and the intermediate neck having coiled round it a cord of two miles, or of
 any required length. In the centre of the lowest circle or bottom is an orifice of
 brass, into which a spindle of light cane is inserted ; and this is fastened at the top
 by a screw so as to keep the machine inflated during pleasure.

    It is now dropped into the water ; and a weight attached to the bottom keeps it
 in a uniform position. Standing at least two feet out of the water, the wind catches
 it, and drives it on. It revolves on a vertical axis, and "pays off" the cord with
 which it is surrounded. When the line has reached the shore, a communication can
 easily be eflfected with the other ship, or the wreck, as the case may be, in either

 direction. It is obvious that additional line can be attached, should the original
 quantity be found insufficient.

    To this general outline, various modifications have been added. For example, a
 brass hoop, the plane of which is vertical, is screwed to the centre of the top, and
 inside this are suspended a lamp and bell. These keep their position in all circum-
 stances, and address themselves to two senses, the eye and the ear. Also, in a
 pocket on the top, suitably protected from the water, letters may be inserted ; so

 that the instrument acts as an inanimate postman, returning with replies, or con-
 veying the most explicit directions. Lastly, to the top are attached ropes by which
 one individual, or even more, can in special circumstances make it serve the purpose
 of a life-buoy ; but this use might interfere with its primary one, which is simply
 that of a communicator. Experiments have shown that it requires about a ton to
 effect its immersion ; and it is hardly possible under any circumstances that such
 an amount of force could be employed.

    There are many circumstances which might arise in which this instrument could
 not be employed ; but the occasions are so numerous in which it could be put to
 its legitimate use, that it is surely most desirable that it should be known and pos-
 sessed. Its perfect portability is a great recommendation ; and its inflation and

 immersion occupy only one minute.

On the Quantity of Heat developed by Water when violently agitated.
                        By George Rennie, F.R.S. S(C.

   Our knowledge of the mechanical properties of heat was very limited until the
jear 1798, when Count Rumford published his valuable paper " On the Source of

Heat excited by Friction." The investigations of Dr. Black, and subsequently of

Watt, Southern, Creighton and Murdoch of Soho, and of Lavoisier, Mongolfier,

Dulong, Seguin, Mayer, &c. on the Continent, have been engaged in similar re-

searches ; while the chemical or mechanical properties of heat have been largely

--augmented by Dalton, Leslie, Taylor, Davy, Faraday, Hesse, and Thomson. The

question may be considered
   1st. As to the effects of electric action in separating or decomposing compound

bodies.      *

2ud. The effects of the compression and extension of solids and fluids.

   3rd. The effects of the chemical affinity of acids on metallic or saline bases, in
which may be included the spontaneous combustion of metals, fossils, and fibrous

substances.

   4th. The condensation and expansion of fluids and gases.
   All these have attracted the attention of modern philosophers, among whom may be
cited the names of Andrews, Graham, Joule, Thomson, Rankine, and of M. Regnault,
whose magnificent experiments, under the auspices of the French government, and

published in the year 1847, and since continued in a second part, have developed,
more fully than hitherto, new values of the calorific and specific heat of water under

different states of density, and temperature, and of other elastic fluids. He found

the calorific capacity of water to be double that of ice or steam, a quality which
would tend to prove that liquid water has a different molecular arrangement from

that of ice or steam.
   But it is owing to the more recent experiments of Mr. Joule, communicated to the

Philosophical Society of Manchester in 1843, to the British Association in 1847 and

1848, and afterwards to the Royal Society in 1849, that we became first acquainted with
the numerical value of heat as a mechanical power. Mr. Joule's experiments* were

made on three different fluids, water, oil, and mercury ; and in all the three cases
the remarkable result appeared, viz. that the mechanical power represented by the

force necessary to raise 774-88 lbs. one foot high, produced a quantity of heat equal
to the temperature of 1 lb. of water raised 1░ Fahrenheit. This equivalent was after-
wards altered by an improvement in the apparatus with which he experimented to
71 libs. ; thus confirming the experiments of Rumford and Davy on the friction of
solids, and proving that the heat of elastic fluids consists simply in the vis viva of
their particles. In the years 1845 and 1847, Mr. Joule employed an agitator to
agitate water, oil, and mercury in a box, to produce fluid friction on the principle of

common paddle-wheel, by which means he obtained equivalents of 781'5, 782'1, and

787'6 respectively.
   These and other experiments left no doubt in his mind as to the existence of an

equivalent relation between force and heat. The care bestowed upon these experi-
ments in deducting the retarding influences entitle them to every credit. Upon
examining the Table showing the results, it does not appear that the temperature of
the water had been raised more than 0-563209░, say half a degree to 97470-2 grains,
or as 1 to 7-84229 lbs. of water, and to a higher temperature, and for mercury, than

31-31. It is desirable, therefore, that these experiments be extended.
   Having long entertained the idea that steam, as applied to the movement of en-

gines, lost a large portion of its heat in the act of transmission, I watched carefully
the attempts which had been hitherto made by inventors for improvements in the
appUcation of it through the medium of atmospherical air, such as by Neipce in
France in 1806, by Sir George Cayley in 1807 and 1838, by Sterling in 1816, by
Erichson in 1826 and 1830, by Brown with his hydrogen gas-engine in 1823, and

by Du Trembley's combined steam and ether engine in 1846; and its subsequent

realization on a great scale in 1849, and more recently by Siemens in his combined
steam- and air-engine now in operation on the Continent, gave reason to expect that

   * In 1843, Mr. Joule announced that he had found that heat was evolved by the passage
of water through small tubes, and that each degree required for its evolution a mechanical

foice of 770 lbs.
--166 REPORT 1856.

the loss of heat occasioned by the use of steam, and which had been variously esti-

mated from tV to xj of the heat transmitted, might be avoided, and that we should
ultimately discover a more economical medium. All these attempts have as yet
been arrested by practical difficulties which have been encountered, but which may

yet be obviated.

The dynamical theory of heat has, however, been more recently developed by

Mayer in 1842*, and Helmholtz in 1847, and greatly extended by Messrs. Rankine
and Thomson about the same period. Mr. Siemens, in his paper " On the Conversion

of Heat into Mechanical Effect," published in the second part of the twelfth volume of

the ' Transactions of the Civil Engineers,' in citing proofs against the material theory

of heat shown by the experiments of Davy and Dulong, says, that, " inasmuch as they

show an intimate connexion between heat and the mechanical force by which it was

produced, and according to which heaf, mechanical force, electricity, chemical affi-

--nity, light and sound are but different manifestations of one great and infinite cause,

motion f, the specific heat and temperature of a body determine the vibrating
velocity of the material particles, the square of which multiplied by the weights of

the particles gives their inherent force or vis viva. In solids, the vis viva is least

remarkable                                                      in  fluids it is  greater.  In gaseous fluids, it predominates so strangely

The above Table is further illustrated b}' a table showing the theoretical and an

actual performance of steam- and air-engines by diagrams showing the curves which

would be indicated theoretically by converting heat into dynamic effect.

In March, 1856, being at Southampton, it occurred to me to make an experiment

on the difference of temperature between the water in the tidal basin of the docks

there, and the water then running through the sluices of the iron gates of one of the

dry docks which was then filling for the purpose of letting out a vessel into the tidal

basin. The result was a difference of two degrees. In both cases the same thermo-

meter was suspended ten minutes in the water of the tidal, and afterwards iu the

current of water running through the sluices into the dry dock. Observations on

the temperature of the sea in stormy weather, and through water-wheel races, always

indicated an increase.

   Being desirous of corroborating these statements, a box or cistern made of deal, 24 by
22J inches square, and 20 inches deep, was prepared ; a quantity of Thames water,

about 20 inches in depth, was poured into it, equal to 4375- lbs. Into the side of the

box was fitted a bent iron tube of 2 in. diameter ; and into the upper part, above the

bend of the pipe, a                                                 glass tube was inserted                                                                                                         so that,  by suspending a  glass  thermo-
                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

meter in the water contained in the tube, the temperature could be easily seen.

   The box was then covered by a wooden lid, so closely fitted as to exclude the sur-

rounding air, and to prevent the loss of water by agitation. A wooden spindle

having four arms, and twelve vertical agitators, was previouslj' fitted into the lid of

the box, as shown by the accompanying woodcut ; a pulley of wood was fitted to the

top of the spindle ; and the apparatus was rapidly revolved in the water by being

connected with a steam-engine.

   * Mayer was the first to observe an increase of temperature of from 12░ Centigrade to 13░
Centigrade by agitating water in the year 1842.

   The remarkable experiments of Beaumont and Mayer in the boiling of 400 litres of water
by the friction of a roller revolving in the interior of a tube, in the middle of a boiler sur-
rounded by water, 1855, at the Paris Exhibition, show the effects of mechanical force,

         The experiment commenced on the 19th of June last.
        The apparatus was then worked for an hour and a half, and the result was the
        iising of the temperature of the water by agitation from 58░ to 64░ Fahrenheit.
         The apparatus, however, got deranged, and the experiments were postponed to the

following da}'. The Thames water was then replaced by clear well-water. The
apparatus was again adjusted. The quantity of water weighed in the box 437 lbs.
The temperature of the air was 65░ Fahrenheit when the experiment commenced,
and of the water 64░ Fahrenheit.

   The apparatus made 270 revolutions per minute, and in 55 minutes raised the
temperature of the water from 64░ to 73^░, or an increase of 9}░ Fahrenheit.

   The experiments were continued on the third day with well-water at 59░, and the
temperature of the air 60i░. The apparatus was worked from 10i> 5░" a.m. to l"- 5TM
P.M., when the temperature of the water was raised from 59░ to 75i░, or 161' in-

crease in three hours.

   On the third day the apparatus was defective from the slipping of the strap, and
only made 140 revolutions instead of 270 revolutions per minute.

have been reduced to an equilibrium.

was left all night for 14 hours exposed to the external air. The temperature of the

or little more than one degree per hour.

   The conclusions to be derived from the foregoing experiments are as yet uncer-
tain. That the evolution of heat by fluid friction has been proved, cannot be doubt-
ful, as has been shown by the refined experiment of Joule ; but by what law re-

 Experiments to determine the Resistance of a Screw when revolving in Water

      at different Depths and Velocities. By George Rennie, F.R.S. SfC.

   The experiments which have hitherto been made upon screw propellers, have had
for their object, principally, to determine their forms and proportions, to enable
them to act most effectively in propelling the vessels to which they were attached,
and at the same time to impede by their form as little as possible the vessel's mo-
tion through the water when under steam or sail.

    In every case it has been considered necessary to give as large a diameter to the
screw as the draft of the vessel would admit, in order that the area of its whole disc
should have as large a proportion to the midship section and resistance to the on-
ward motion of the vessel as possible. So that the present state of our knowledge
upon screw propulsion is confined to the best form and ai'ea of the propeller and of
the vessel to which it is attached.

   The experiments of Mr. Barlow on several of Her Majesty's paddle wheel vessels,
and of Mr. Lloyd on the propelling powers of Her Majesty's steam sloop ' Rattler,'
and the recent investigations of Mr. Charles Atherton, had already established cer-
tain relations between these extremes. But no experiments have as yet been re-
corded on the action of screw propellers immersed at different depths and driven at

high velocities.

   Last year my attention was called by Mr. Joseph Apsey, an engineer of Broad-

wall, in the parish of Christ Church, Surrey, to some remarkable properties which
he stated to have discovered in a double screw which he had invented, but which
was similar in every respect to the screw used in the Archimedes steamer.

   The screw which he experimented upon was of brass 13f diameter, 28 inches
pitch, and 145 square inches, or about 1 foot area. The screw was fixed upon an

So that on reducing the results, they approximated to a parabolic curve with high
velocities, and a sharper curve with lower velocities. The conclusions derived from
these experiments at the meeting at Glasgow in 1855, were, that the water being
confined in a boiler by its reaction damaged the results, and were not to be de-
pended upon.

   In order, however, to remove further doubts on the subject, I had an apparatus
constructed somewhat similar, figure 3, as represented in the accompanying wood-
cut, with these differences, that the diameter of the screw was 1 ft. 9 in., and its
disc area 346^ square inches, or nearly 2^ times larger than Mr. Apsey's screw.
The screw worked on the outside of the cistern, and the lever and weights and
pulley were inside the cistern, the water having been kept out by means of a stuff-
ing-box let into one of the sides of the cistern, through which the spindle of the
screw worked. The experiments were made in the river Thames ; so that as the
tide rose or fell, the screw could be driven at different depths outside the cast-iron

cistern, while the observations were taken within the cistern.
   The greatest speed at which the screw could be driven, was at the rate of 558 re-

--volutions per minute, and the following were the results :

Experiments made in June, 1856, in the river Tliames, for the purpose of determining
   the resistances experienced by an ordinary two-bladed screw propeller when driven at
   a high rate of speed and at different depths.

  On comparing these experiments, it will be seen that, although the propeller is of

larger dimensions than that of Mr. Apsey, the thrusts are not so great. In the first
case, the velocity is nearly twice as great, while the area, taken as discs, are as
1 : 2'47 ; but taking the respective thrusts of the two propellers, Mr. Apsey's in the
boiler, and mine in the open river Thames, the ratios of resistance or thrusts of the
propellers at one, two, and three feet immersion respectively, are not very dis-

similar.

   In both cases the influence of velocity is much greater than depth, and is such
as to approximate the action of a screw in a solid, like which the water becomes
when rapidly acted upon ; but the joint influence of depth and velocity shows that
the thrust or resistance of the screw is 6J times greater when immersed three feet

below the water level than when working at a level ; consequently, a screw whose
disc area is one-sixth, three-fourths of the area of the screw, when the level of the

water is level with its circumference, is equally effective. If this be the fact, as the
often-repeated experiments proved, it is reasonable to expect very important results

hereafter in the use of the screw ; and further, if one small screw proportioned as

above shown be as effective as one large screw working in the dead wood, how much
smaller and more effective will be two screws, when applied to a vessel's quarters on
either side of the dead wood and stern

    Crystallogenesis, and the Equivalent in the Mineral Kingdom corresponding to

    --Geographical Distribution in the Animal and Vegetable Kingdoms. By

       Samuel Highley, F.G.S. (Read in 1854.)

      The author pointed out, that in mineralogy no scientific value could be attached to
   Locality, equivalent to that which it possessed in botany or zoology ; and although
   the Leonhards had published works on topographical mineralogy, no laws had been
   deduced analogous to those of the geographical distribution of plants and animals,
   though it was very evident local conditions determined the association of minerals,
   and the aspect, form or its modifications, isomorphic constitution, colour, &c. of the
   same species ; and as we know from laboratory experience that teinperature, light,
   electricity, magnetism, catalytic action, &c. are determining influences in crystallogenic
   force, we must learn in detail the physical as well as the chemical conditions of geo-
   logical districts in various parts of the globe before we should have data for founding
   any general laws on the mineral-producing conditions of the earth. The following
   form was then proposed and described in detail for tabulating local mineralogical
   phaenomena, which if distributed amongst naturalists, mine-masters, &c. at home and
   abroad and returns obtained, would furnish matter for deductions, not only of value
   in mineralogical, but also in physical, geological, zoological, ethnological, and agricul-

    tural science.

(so far as they are chemical), are not measurable by the amount of the additional
mineral food of plants liberated thereby, these being under ordinary cultivation in
excess of the assimilable nitrogen existing in, or condensed within the soil in the

-- --same period of time ; the amount of which latter therefore the available nitrogen

is the measure of the increased produce of grain which will be obtained.
   4. That the beneficial effects of rotation, in increasing the production of saleable

produce (so far as they are chemical), are not explained by the fact of one plant
taking from the soil more of the different mineral constituents than another, but
depend on the property of the so-called green or fallow crops bringing on, or con-
serving upon the farm, more of substance rich in nitrogen than is yielded to them in
manure, whilst the crops to which they are subservient are both largely exported
from the farm, and yield in their increase considerably less of nitrogen than is given
to them in manure.

    5. In a word, that in the existing condition of ^H^xsh agriculture, a full pro-
duction of the saleable cereal grains, with at the saiie time other exportable produce,

-- --is only attained whether by manures, fallow, or rotation by an accumulation of

available nitrogen (normally an atmospheric constituent), within the soil itself.

                On the Composition of Wheat-Grain, and its Products.
    By J. B. Lawes, F.R.8., F.C.S., and J. H. Gilbert, Ph.D., F.C.S.

   The authors had for a series of years conducted experiments on the successive
growth of wheat, on the same land, by different chemical manures. The general
result of these experiments had been to show, that, although the amount of the pro-
duce had been much increased by the use of nitrogenous manures, the per-centage of
nitrogen in the grain had been, comparatively speaking, but little affected thereby.
Variation in season had had more influence on the composition of the crop in this
respect. It had further appeared, that, within the limits of their own locality and
climate, there was, on the average of the seasons, a lower per-centage both of nitrogen
and of mineral matter in the grain, the more favourably the produce was developed
and matured. The varying composition of the entire grain as affected by season and
manuring, the authors hoped to treat of more fully elsewhere * ; their object, in the
present paper, being chiefly to call attention to some points in the character and com-
position of the different products obtained from wheat-grain by means of mechanical

separation.

   With a view to the prosecution of this part of the inquii"y, in selected cases, quan-
tities of the experimentally grown grains, namely, seven lots from the produce of 1846,
nineteen from that of 1847, and two from that of 1848, had been carefully watched
through the milling process. In some of the cases nine, and in others seven different
products of the dressing apparatus, were separately taken. The proportion of each of
the several products in the respective grains was ascertained and recoi'ded, and the
per-centages of dry substance and mineral matter were also in every case determined.
The three first wires of the dressing machine gave on the average rather more than
70 per cent, of the grain asjine flour; but in practice about 10 per cent, more would
be obtained from the next two products, yielding in all 80 per cent, or move of pretty
good bread flour. The average amount of dri/ substance in the various mill products
was about 85 per cent. ; the external or more branny portions containing rather mere,
and the finer flours rather less. The per-centage oi mineral matter varied very much
in the different products, it being scarcely |ths of 1 per cent, in the fine flours, and
ten times as much, or more than 7 per cent., in the coarsest bran. From the much
larger proportion of flour than bran, however, it resulted that rather more than -^^rd
of the total mineral matter of the grain would be accumulated in its currently edible

portions.

    In one series of these mill-products, from the finest flour at the head of the ma-
chine down to the coarsest bran, the nitrogen was determined, and also some of
the constituents of the respective ashes. It appeared that the per-centage of nitrogen
was about once and a half as great in the bran as in the finer flours. And even in-
cluding all the currently edible portions, still the excluded branny parts contained

considerably higher per-centages of nitrogen. Turning to the ashes of the respective
mill-products, there was a much larger proportion of matter insoluble in acid in those
of the finer flours than in those of the coarser brans ; of the phosphoric acid, on the
other hand, there was considerably the higher per-centage in the ash of the brans.
The magnesia also was the higher in the ash of the brans, and the potash and lime
the higher in that of the flours. Looking to the distribution of the various consti-
tuents, according to the average proportion in the grain, of each of the several mill-
products, it appeared that about |ths of the total nitrogen, and about |rd or -Iths of
the total mineral matter, were accumulated in the usually edible flours, and of the
total phosphoric acid, there was only about ird in the ashes of the latter. Notwith-
standing the higher per-centage of nitrogen, and the large actual amounts of the
mineral constituents of the grain contained in the branny portions, the authors were
of opinion, that, besides the information at present at command as to the character
and condition of the nitrogenous constituents of the bran, such were the effects of the
branny particles themselves in increasing the peristaltic action, and thus clearing the
alimentary canal more rapidly of its contents, that it was questionable whether fre-
quently more nutriment would not be lost to the system by the admission into the
food of the imperfectly divided branny particles, than would be gained by the in-
troduction into the body coincidently with them of the larger amount of supposed
nutritious matters. The action alluded to might indeed be conducive to health with
those of a sluggish habit or who were overfed ; but with those who were not so, the
benefits derivable from an already perhaps scanty diet would be still further reduced.

    Experiments were also described, in which several lots of the experimentally grown
wheats were ground in a colonist's steel hand-mill. The results of the examination
of the products thus obtained were in the main consistent with those from the pro-
ducts of the ordinary mill. They showed, however, more strikingly the effects of
mechanical means in separating different chemical compounds within the limits of

 the floury parts of the grain.
    Experiments were next adduced, in which the different edible products, from grains

grown by different manures or in different seasons, were made into bread ; the several
products of the dressing machine being employed sometimes separately and some-
times collectively. The result obtained was, that comparing with each other the three
 separate products which together yielded a fine flour, that at the head of the machine,
 which was the least nitrogenous, yielded on the average the least weight of bread for
 a given amount of flour, that is to say, it retained the least amount of water. Again,
 when the three products were mixed together, the flours of the season of 1846, which
 were the less nitrogenous, gave the less weight of bread, that is, retained less water
 than those of 1847, which were rather the more nitrogenous. The effect of an in-
 crease of nitrogen in augmenting the weight of bread was, however, not observable
 when this increase was due to including more of the more branny portions of the grain.

--The average yield of bread in twenty-two experiments with the individual products

 was rather more than 135 for every 100 of flour, equal to about 63 per cent, of dry
 substance and 37 of water in the bread. The average of nineteen experiments with fine
 flour, composed of the products of the first three wires mixed together, gave a produce
 of about 137^ of bread for every 100 of flour, and about 61^ of dry substance, and
 381 of water in the bread. Bakers' loaves were next examined. Of these, four ob-
 tained from different bakers in the country gave an average of about 62 per cent, of
 dry substance and 38 of water in the bread ; and three procured in London, rather
 more than 64 of dry matter and rather less than 36 of water. The authors concluded,
 that from 36 to 38 per cent, of water was perhaps the best average that could be
 assumed for bakers' bread within twelve hours of its being withdrawn from the oven.
 They showed, by reference to a Table of the results of other experimenters, that this
 agreed pretty well with the determinations of some of the most recent and trust-
 worthy. Others, however, gave the water in bread as much higher ; and all seem to
 agree that it was generally higher in country bread than in that of towns and

  cities.

     The point next illustrated was the general influence of locality and varying cli-
  matic circumstance upon the per-centage of gluten in wheaten-fiour. It appeared
  by the numerous results adduced, that, other things being equal, there was a tendency
  to an increase in the per-centage of gluten, proceeding from the north to the south
  a point which was illustrated in specimens both from the European and American

Acontinents.  comparatively high ripening temperature was indeed, among other

circumstances, favourable to a high per-cenlage of gluten. There were, however, in-

teresting exceptions to this generalization ; at any rate, so far as the per-centage of

the nitrogen, if not of the gluten itself, was concerned.

The foreign wheats containing a high per-centage of gluten, which were generally

ripened under a high temperature, had the undoubted character of yielding a flour of

great 'strength,' and retaining a considerable amount of water in the bread. Owing,

however, to their frequent hardness, and the peculiarity of their structural character

generally, which rendered them both refractory in the mill, and less fitted to make

an easily workable dough, and a bread of the desired colour, texture, and lightness,

they were less valued to use alone for bread-making purposes than many grains of

less per-centage of gluten, provided only that they are in an equal condition as to
maturation or elaboration of their constituents. Some of the most approved foreign

bread-flour grains in the market had indeed a comparatively low per-centage of nitro-
gen ; but apparently of very high condition of both their nitrogenous and non-nitro-
genous compounds, as well as a very favourable relation to each other of these two
classes of constituents. AVithin the limits of our own island, again, on the average of
seasons, the better elaborated grain would probably be the less nitrogenous ; though
the nitrogenous matter it did contain would be in a high condition as to elaboration,
and as to its mutual relations, structural and chemical, with the other constituents of
the flour." Hence it came to pass, that as our home-grown flours go, those which
were the best in the view of the baker would frequently be those having a compara-
tively lovf per-centage of nitrogenous compounds, a higher condition more than com-
pensating for the higher per-centage of nitrogen, generally associated as it was in our
climate with an inferior degree of development and maturation of the grain.

The authors further maintained, that the high per-centage of nitrogen or gluten in

wheaten-flour was no more an unconditional measure of value to the consumer, than

it was in the view of the baker.
   In illustration of this latter point, a Table was exhibited showing the relation of

nitrogen to carbon in a number of current articles of food. It was submitted, that
the under-fed or chiefly bread-fed working man, would, as his means increased, ge-

nerally first have recourse to the addition of bacon, or other highly fatty matters
which, though they might increase the actual amount of nitrogen consumed, would

seldom increase, and frequently decrease, the proportion of the nitrogenous or flesh-

forming to the more exclusively respiratory and fat-forming constituents. Indeed, so

large was the amount of fat, and therefore of respirable hydrogen, as well as respirable

carbon, even in fresh meat itself, that by its use the proportion of the nitrogenous to
the other constituents would be much less augmented than might be generally sup-

posed.

On the Correlation of the North American and British Paleeozoic Strata. By
   Henry Darwin Rogers, Corresp. Memb. of the British Association, Hon.

   F.R.S.E., F.G.S. 8(c.

   The paleeozoic system of strata constituting the first term in the great succession
of fossiliferous deposits of the globe, surpasses in geological interest all other groups
of rocks. It is from it that we learn under what types animal and vegetable existence
appeared in the morning of the great day of life, which is only now culminating
towards its noon. The classification of the palaeozoic deposits, only another expres-
sion for the determination of their true chronology, assumes in this light a high im-
portance, since through it alone can we trace the physical history of our earth through
the most interesting of all its phases, that of the infancy of its inhabitants ; but a
sound classification and correct chronology are not to be reached but through a compa-
rison of the sediments and fossils of very wide areas, indeed, not until the contents
of several great ancient contemporaneous basins have been faithfully coordinated.
This consideration confers an especial interest at the present time, upon the study of
the palaeozoic fields of North America, which constitute, apparently, five-sixths of
that wide continent, and possess, from their very breadth of distribution and amazing
continuity of mineral and organic type, unusual value for such comparison. Their title
to the attention of the philosophical geologist will be admitted when he reflects,
1st, on the remoteness and apparently partial original insulation of the North Ame-
rican palaeozoic basin from the European one ; 2ndly, on their amplitude and unbroken

continuity, offering unusual facilities for the detection and tracing of their natural
horizons ; 'and Srdlj', on the fullness of the whole series of deposits as a record of
the physical and vital conditions of the ages which beheld their accumulation. The
American basin is not only more replete in specific forms than the pala-ozoic basin
of Europe, but more abundant in well-defined palseontological horizons. Geographi-
cally more continuous, it appears to be stratigraphically more expanded. From the
lowest platform of ancient life to the uppermost layers crowning the coal series, its
latest formation, the aggregate thickness of the strata is between 35,000 and 40,000 feet.

   To coordinate faithfully such distant affiliated systems of strata, each set of the rocks
to be compared should be classified in accordance with their own phsenomena, and
not upon any preconceived notions of their equivalency to the deposits of independent
districts assumed as standards ; nor should the classification rest solely on the rela-

tions of their organic remains, but should recognize equally their physical peculiarities

or composition, and the nature of the horizons dividing them. From a deferential
feeling among American palaeontologists towards their learned British brethren,

there has been, the author conceives, a disposition to apply prematurely a favourite
British nomenclature to the American strata, and this unphilosophical procedure has
tended to check that spirit of free inquiry which is indispensable to the perception of
the wider relationships and grander laws of creation. To apply to a large field of
 nature in North America an interpretation expressed in a classification and nomen-
clature drawn from a distant region across the Atlantic, is to make one country a
 standard for another ; whereas by the sanctions of inductive philosophy, each great

tract of creation must be its own exemplar, must itself furnish the measure of its own
 phsenomena. In the universal federation of scientific intellect, no community or
 school of thinkers, however able or authoritative within their own domain, can be-
 come a supreme court of opinion in questions of a world-broad significance.

    Hitherto little has been done by the American and European geologists who have

 attempted the arduous study of the American palaeozoic basin, to measure the de-
 grees of relationship subsisting between its constituent formations, while those
 affinities which have been examined have been almost exclusively palaeontological.
 In this field all honour is due to the masterly labours of James Hall, and the in-
 vestigations of M. De Verneuil, and of the lamented Daniel Sharpe. Other skilful
 naturalists have contributed much to the definition of the American species ; Conrad

 of Philadelphia, and William Salter of the Geological Survey of Great Britain, have

 supplied many valuable determinations. Still there has been no systematic attempt

 to explore the physical phsenomena, which are in beautiful coordination with these pa-
 lseontological discoveries. While the fossils have been appealed to, as they should in

  everv attempt at classification, the strata themselves have scarcely been interrogated.
     In the present essay, the author's leading aim is to indicate the principal natural

 planes which intersect the North American pateozoic strata and insulate them more
  or less into formations, and to point out the relative magnitudes of the breaks of con-
  tinuity, both as respects their geographical areas, and their greater or less distinctness

  in the vertical scale. But first it will be expedient to sketch the general limits of the
  palaeozoic area of North America and of its chief subordinate basins.

                                       Paleozoic Basins of North America.

    We may estimate the surface originally covered by palteozoic sediments on this

  continent at about five-sixths of all the land between the North Atlantic, Pacific, and
  Arctic Oceans. These deposits are embraced in two great natural basins, bounded by
  zones of the older crj'stalline rocks. By far the largest is a great interior basin,

   spreading from the Appalachian chain to the Pacific mountains, and from the parallel
   of 32" or 33░ to the Arctic Sea and the Laurentian water-shed. This continental

   palaeozoic area includes three wide fields of these rocks, partially separated superficially

  by overlapping newer strata, but probably united underneath. These may be desig-

   nated severally as the Appalachian, the Saskatchewan, and the Chippewayan basins.

   The first extends westward from the Appalachian mountains to the eastern edge of
   the sandy plains of Texas, Kansas, and Nebraska, and northward from the low cre-

   taceous and tertiary plane fringing the Gulf of Mexico to the crystalline zone north
   of the St. Lawrence and its lakes. The Saskatchewan basin, strictly a prolongation

   of the Appalachian area, is a long palaeozoic belt stretching north-westward from the
                                                                                       ;;

sources of the Red River of Winnipeg to the Arctic Sea, between the crystalline

lacustrine zone on its east, and the cretaceous and tertiary prairies on its west.

   The Chippewayan basin, more vaguely known, may be defined, provisionally, as
coextensive with the Rocky Mountains and Humboldt Mountains of the Utah

Desert, and as including wide tracts surrounding the sources of the Rio-Colorado

of California, palaeozoic rocks being developed on a stupendous scale between the
Rocky Mountains and the Salt Deserts of Utah and the Columbia River. It would

seem from paleeontologic evidence, that each chief division of palaeozoic time, except

the Permian, is represented within each of these vast tracts or basins; and there appear
good reasons for inferring that many of the Appalachian formations, modified in com-

position and fossils, extend into both the other areas.

   The Hudson Bay Palceozoic Basin, lying north of the crystalline plateau, skirting
the valley of rhe St. Lawrence and its lakes, is of much more limited extent than
the main continental area. The zone of metamorphic rocks separating the two, after

running from Labrador to the head of Lake Superior, deflects to the north-west and

ranges in that direction 1500 miles to the Arctic Sea. Hitherto no strata of Cambrian

--or Lower Silurian age have been detected within the basin thus enclosed.
   Appalachian Formations. The palaeozoic strata of the Appalachian basin consti-

tute fifteen series or natural groups, individualized by distinctive organic species and
by their mineral composition. Some of these blend together both in their fossils and
their materials more than others, and it becomes important to ascertain their relative

degrees of affinity. Objecting to a geographical nomenclature as inapplicable to

formations so very widely distributed, and on the same ground of their inconstancy, to

the plan of naming them from prevailing local fossil or mineral features, titles have been

applied to them based on the consideration of their relative age, using a series of terms

significant of the different natural periods of the day as metaphorically expressing the

relative ages of the formations. These Appalachian rocks of North America are
therefore here named Primal, Auroral, Matinal, Levant, Surgent, Scalent, Premeri-

dian, Meridian, Pomeridian, Cadent, Vergent, Ponent, Vespertine, Umbral and Serai

the deposits, that is to say, of the dawn, daybreak, morning, sunrise, mounting-

evening, dusk and nightfall.

among the European strata ; also their lithological characters, their more character-

istic organic remains, and the nature and relative magnitude of the physical and

ontological breaks which separate them ; but it is too voluminous to be inserted

This vast succession of strata admits of a somewhat natural classification into four

assemblages, partially representing the Cambrian, Silurian, Devonian, and Carboni-

ferous series of European geologists, but the relative values of these groups are by no

means the same as the European, and it is doubtful if some of them can be strictly coor-
dinated. One main object of this essay is to indicate the proportionate value of the

differential elements which divide the fifteen members of the system, and bring these

into relationship with the palseontological breaks upon the recognition of which the

palaeozoic rocks of Europe have received their present classification. Attention will

be first directed to the stratigraphical phaenomena, and then to the palaeontological

but some preliminary suggestions will be offered respecting the inferences to be de-

duced from the conditions of superposition of strata.

   It must be conceded that every over-resting sheet or current of water has left some
permanent monument of its presence, and therefore wherever between two strata or
ancient surfaces known to have been produced in periods separated by some interval

of time nothing sedimentary intervenes, we must assume the vacuous space to have

been dry land. It is not supposable that water, endowed as it is with a power of

suspending and transporting sedimentary matter into the very middle of the ocean,

and there and everywhere teeming with animal and vegetable organisms, could have

rested over any surface without leaving an indelible record behind it. Until it can

be proved that some one formation has been thoroughly swept away from a wide
area where it was deposited, we are not entitled by rules of sound reasoning to infer

that such have existed.

   Looking at the conditions under which strata repose upon each other, we may view

their relations of superposition under the four following categories.

   1st. Successive deposits may lie together in parallel arrangement, and so graduate

into each other as to denote no pause in time or interruption in the formative process ;
and even a formation of one long period may thus graduate into another by their
sediments and their fossils. Such a close following of strata, the author entitles a

conformable continuous sequence.

   2nd. One set of strata may rest immediately on another with perfect parallelism,

and yet their plane of contact represent a long interval of time and a total change of
sedimentary conditions and of the physical geography ; for certain beds or even whole

formations interposed between them in other districts, may be altogether absent.

 This relationship is entitled a conformaUe interrtipted sequence.
    It proves not merely a lift of the w^atery floor into dry land, and its subsequent

re-immersion, but a movement unaccompanied by any tilting or undulation of the

 lower deposit.

    3rd. An upper group of beds may repose on a lower with an angle between them

 such as to imply an uptilting from horizontality in the inferior, before the superior
 was deposited, while a close sequence of type in their organic remains shows them to
 be the products of immediately consecutive periods, or that no time elapsed for the
 production elsewhere of a middle formation. This relationship is entitled an uncon-

formable continuous sequence.

    4th. Two sets of strata resting in contact, may present not only an absence of

 parallellism, but an omission of one or more intermediate formations elsewhere
 existing. This state of things implies not only an inclining of the inferior beds, but a
 lifting of them into dry land, with a lapse of time before their imraersionfor the recep-
 tion of the overlying deposits. Such a condition, familiar as the commonest species of
 unconformity, may fitly be entitled an unconformable interrupted sequence.

    The fifteen principal divisions of the Appalachian palaeozoic strata contain several
 important planes of discontinuity. These are of very unequal magnitude, both geogra-
 phically and stratigraphically. Between them are other lesser horizons, but only the
 greater'ones are discussed in this paper. The two most conspicuous of all, are that
 at the end of the Matinal or Hudson River period, and that at the beginning of the
 Vespertine or first Carboniferous age. Another, though materially less extensive
 one, divides the Premeridian or Lower Helderberg period from the Meridian or

 Oriskany sandstone age.

     The break or plane of discontinuity terminating the Matinal series or Hudson
  River group, exceeds all the others in the Appalachian basin for the abruptness of
 the transition which it implies in the organic remains, and in the magnitude of the
 crust-movement. From the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the Hudson River, nearly 800
 miles, this break is marked by an unconformable interrupted sequence ; the Matinal
  rocks highly inclined and folded, generally supporting less inclined strata of the Levant

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 '

  or some other middle paleeozoic formation. The Scalent or Niagara group, next to
  the highest of the four true Silurian equivalents, reposes discordantly upon the Upper
  Cambrian or Matinal, not only in the Peninsula of Gaspe, but in the Eastern Town-
  ships and in Vermont. The evidence of a great crust-movement at this epoch of the
  close of the Matinal slates, was shown by the author as long ago as 1838, in an
  annual report on the geological survey of Pennsylvania, where he pointed out the
  unconformity in the vicinity of the Hudson River, and drew the inference of an up-
  heaval of the bed of the ancient ocean. It would appear that throughout this north-
  eastern division of the Appalachian chain, the movement at the epoch separating the
  Cambrian and Silurian or older and newer Silurian periods, was so vehement, as to
  plicate and partially metamorphose the older strata. The condition of unconformity,
  with and without interruption of sequence in the strata, extends to the west side of
  the River Hudson, and there is good geological evidence that the displacement of level
  producing it reached westward as far as Oneida Lake. Undulated Matinal rocks
  support horizontal Niagara or Scalent strata, with a lapse of two intermediate for-

  mations for some distance from the Hudson, westward along the base of the Helderberg

range. Ascending the Mohawk valley, the undulation in the Cambrian rocks disap-

pears, and both series become approximately horizontal and parallel, but still with

omission of formations.
    South-westward from the Hudson, following the north-west margin of the great

Appalachian valley, one may trace this plane of discontinuity as far as Eastern
Tennessee, or even into Alabama ; for throughout this whole distance of 800 or 900
miles, though there is no lapse of a formation at the plane of contact, or any physical
unconformity, there is universally so abrupt and crisp an horizon dividing the
strata, in respect to composition, conditions of bedding, and organic remains, and
such plain evidence that the upper rock was formed from the wreck of the lower

ones, that the conviction is inevitable, that a crust-movement revolutionizing the
physical geography extended throughout this whole space. The Levant rocks, though
next in succession to the Matinal, and reposing conformably upon them, give evidence
of such a movement in every feature of their composition. The lower bed is usually
a conglomerate composed of fragments of all the underlying formations of the earlier
palseozoic or Cambrian series. Some of its pebbles belong to the Primal sandstone

some are of chert from the Auroral limestone, and much of the grey sandy matter
has evidently come from the Matinal slate group.

   Turning attention to the pheenomena connected with this horizon in other parts of
the broad Appalachian basin west of the mountains, it can be shown, that, over half

the width of the continent, there exists, notwithstanding an almost absolute horizon-
tality and parallelism of the two sets of strata, or the lower and middle palaeozoic

series, a true discontinuity in the sequence of the formations. In New York there

is a conformable interrupted sequence from the Hudson to Oneida county ; from
Oneida to Lake Ontario the Levant conglomerate, or Lowest Silurian stratum, enters
the gap and makes the sequence complete.

   But this state of things nowhere again prevails from Lake Ontario westward to
Illinois and the Missouri River, nor southward from the Laurentian Lakes to the
southern outcrops of the two systems on the borders of Alabama, Arkansas, and
Texas.

   The Medina sandstone, a higher Levant stratum, partially fills the break across

New York, and across Canada to the Manitoulin islands of Lake Huron, where,

after constantly thinning, it dies out. Thence to the western boundary of Iowa the
hiatus remains unsupplied by any equivalent throughout this whole distance. Tracing
the Surgent or Clinton group, the second Silurian formation ascending along the
same plane of discontinuity, it is found, after entering the brake or gap near Schoharie,
to stretch westward to the Niagara River, and north-westward to the Manitoulins,
and possibly thence to Green Bay. Beyond the Niagara River it is an extremely
thin bed of limestone and calcareous shale. Thus from the peninsula of Michigan to
the cretaceous plains of the Missouri, two entire formations are omitted above the
top of the lower palaeozoic or Cambrian formations. The Sealant or Niagara series,
the third Silurian group, ranges through a wider zone. Thin and obscure in the

eastern part of New York, and almost gone in the Appalachian chain from the
Hudson southward, it is an important stratum from western New York westward

to its disappearance beneath its cretaceous covering in the plains of Nebraska. It
was the first middle palaeozoic or Silurian deposit, formed upon the floor of the old
Appalachian sea, upon its re-immersion after its upheaval at the close of the Matinal

period.

  --Reviewing these statements, we arrive at this interesting general picture : 1st, a

violent and universal agitation of the whole bed of the Appalachian palaeozoic ocean
at the close of the Matinal period, resulting in its upheaval and drainage, from the
region of the Gulf of St. Lawrence to that of the centre of the continent, and in a
general shoaling of every other portion. 2nd, a more local paroxysmal movement
of depression accompanied by the formation of the Levant or Oneida conglomerate,
followed by a gradual and successive subsidence, letting in the ocean over a wider
space during the Levant and Surgent periods, until in the Scalent or Niagara period
the whole area was reclaimed again by the ocean. In the first stage of the subsidence,
the sea filled only a long, narrow trough, parallel with the present Appalachians ; in
the next or Median age, it had spread along its northern coast westward as far as
Lake Huron, but was evidently very shallow ; and in the following or Surgent period,

one enclosing Cincinnati, the other occupying a central position in the plain of

Middle Tennessee. Upon the Matinal strata, which are there very calcareous,
there rests not a vestige of the Levant or Medina formation, and scarcely a trace of
the Clinton or Surgent. The first Silurian deposit lapping upon the uppermost Cam-
brian, is the Scalent or Niagara limestone. Still more striking is the hiatus, where

the contact of the lower with the middle palaeozoic formations is exposed round
the margin of the Tennessee anticlinal, for there we find on its eastern side, neither
Levant, Surgent, Scalent, nor Premeridian rocks, that is to say, no proper Silurian

--formation whatsoever, and on its western only a thin layer of the Scalent or Niagara.
    Break in Eastern Missouri. From Lake Superior, by the valley of the Upper Missis-
sippi, and by the Ozark and Washita Hills, to the igneous range of the Rio-Colorado

of Texas, there is a chain of broad anticlinals, exposing ancient plutonic andgneissic
rocks, but chiefly the older paheozoics near their axes. Around every one of these,
either the middle, that is Silurian and Devonian, or upper, namely the Carboniferous
deposits, rest in discordant superposition with or without parallelism upon thePrimal,
Auroral, or Matinal members of the older palaeozoic division. This condition prevails
in southern Wisconsin, but to a more marked degree around the anticlinal area
traversed by the Missouri River eastward of the Osage*.

   On the western and northern borders of the Matinal area, some one of the Carbo-

niferous formations very generally reposes unconformably upon the strata of the
older palaeozoic or Cambrian age, all the middle formations, Silurian and Devonian,
being absent. Here then we have the clearest demonstration, that the anticlinal zone
of the Lower Missouri remained in the condition of dry land from the period of the
general movement of the bed of the Appalachian Sea at the close of theMatinal period
throughout all tlie long ages of the middle palaeozoic formations. This district gives
evidence of a similar, but less extensive paroxysmal movement, resulting in discordant
stratification at the beginning of the Carboniferous period, but the discussion of this

and other subsequent displacements of the crust can only be alluded to in this abstract.
The physical break visible throughout this western chain of anticlinals implies a
wider interval of time, or longer cessation of formative actions, than is discernible
anywhere further east within the Appalachian area.

    Reasoning from the data afforded by recent geological researches, especially those
of Owen, Norwood and Swallow, the author infers that the Silurian waters, even as
late as the Scalent or Niagara period, when they had attained their widest expansion,
were by no means co-extensive with the wide bounds of that earlier Appalachian
ocean which covered the Matinal and other primordial palaeozoic sediments. In the
middle latitudes of the United States, tjiis Silurian sea had crept no further eastward

than a line joining the Tennessee anticlinal and the Helderbexg Hills of New York,
prolonged thence into New England, Lower Canada, and New Brunswick. It occu-

pied the area of the present Laurentian Lakes, but did not reach the limit of the
ancient Matinal sea even in that direction, and towards the west and south-west it
did not spread to the Lower Missouri. It was merely a wide Mediterranean, covering

the area which is now the northern-middle and north-western Atlantic States. [Want
of space compels the omission of that part of the memoir which relates to the Sas-

    Palceozoic Basin of Hudson Bay. The north-eastern palaeozoic basin of North
 America is encircled on three sides by a low, broad zone of gneissic and azoic strata,
 between 200 and 300 miles broad, and of a curved length of not less than 3000 miles,
 from Labrador to the Arctic Sea. This belt is not, in the proper sense, an axis of
 crust elevation, but more truly, the still uncovered remnant of the broad floor of
 metamorphic strata upon which the palaeozoic deposits of the two great basins which

fringe it were accumulated. It seems not to have been sensibly upheaved since the

date of their deposition.

    Of the age of the palaeozoic basin of Hudson Bay, recent research has furnished
some very suggestive information. According to the statements of the geologists of the
Canadian government, and others, it has hitherto disclosed not a single fossil indi-

cative of the existence of either the Primal, Auroral, or Matinal formations of the
older palaeozoic series, but it abounds in deposits of middle palaeozoic or Silurian
age. Mr. Isbister, in an admirable summary of the results of research in this region,
considers this important general fact to be well-established for all the widely scattered
localities hitherto visited. It receives the strongest confirmation from the determi-

nations of Mr. Salter, who has devoted a careful scrutiny to the extensive collection
of fossils brought to England by the recent Arctic expeditions. According to Isbister,
middle palaeozoic or Silurian rocks extend uninterruptedly from Lake Temiscaming,

a little above 47░ latitude, to the shores of Wellington Channel beyond ^7░, or through
more than 30░. From all the geological evidence collected, it would appear that a
large portion, if not the whole of this wide palaeozoic area remained uncovered by
the sea throughout the three earlier or Cambrian periods, and was not submersed
until that stupendous disturbance of the crust took place which displaced so large a
tract of the bed of the Appalachian ocean. This north-eastern area was therefore
the nucleus of the continent, or, at least, one island centre, from the infancy of its
growth down to the end of the Matinal ages. The stupendous movement which
then depressed its central districts, converting it into a Silurian basin, also lifted off
a large part of the waters to the south of the neutral axis of motion marked by the

dividing zone of metamorphic strata. No sharp corrugations of the crust attended

this enormous displacement of the levels, analogous to the crust-undulations of the
same epoch between Gaspe and the Hudson. Still the subsidence of the Hudson
Bay region must have been violent or paroxysmal, if we are to judge from the con-
glomerates which strew its immediate floor, their lowest bed, according to Sir William
Logan, being composed of great boulders and blocks of sandstone, some of them 9 feet
in diameter, so energetic was the disturbance which attended the letting on of the
waters. It is not certain that this subsidence occurred at the beginning of the
Levant or first Silurian period, for Mr. Salter has shown* that all the strata of the
southern border of the Hudson Bay area yet examined, are of the age of the Scalent
or Niagara limestone. It is probable that after the first tremendous and nearly
universal disturbance of the levels at the close of the Matinal period, there occurred
an interval of comparative repose, with a slow deposition of the Levant and Surgent
formations in the central and southern tracts of the Appalachian Sea, and also in the
central parts of the Hudson Bay basin; and that succeeding this there was a broad,
nearly equalized subsidence of the whole northern basin, and the northern half of the
southern one in the Scalent or Niagara period.

   Reviewing all the facts, it would seem that the wide break in the sequence of the
American palaeozoic strata above the Matinal, or latest Cambrian formation, is as
well indicated north of the Laurentian metamorphic zone as south of it, though not
by a physical unconformity in the usual narrow sense, but by a prodigious hiatus in

the series of deposits.
    [The paper next contains " Evidences of a physical break or interruption in the

depositions between the Premeridian or latest Silurian, and Pomeridian or Devonian
formations," and also " Evidences of a similar physical break between the Pomeri-
dian and Vespertine, or earliest Carboniferous formations." These instances of dis-
cordant sequence are shown to be of less magnitude than that already discussed
between the Matinal and succeeding deposits; and as the physical breaks are, so are
the palaeontologic ; the transition in the organic remains being far more complete
and abrupt between the lower and middle palaozoics, than between the middle and
upper or anywhere within the middle between its Silurian and Devonian equivalents.]

markable. All the American palaeozoic formations appear to contain fewer species

in common than do the European ; and even strictly sequent formations divided by

no crisp physical plane, display decidedly abrupt transitions in their organic types.

No doubt every such sharp palaontological horizon coincides with a horizon of true

physical discontinuity, or sudden change at least, somewhere within the same
basin. Indeed, such palajontological planes may be accepted as evidence of im-
portant revolutions in the level of the ancient oceanic floor. This horizon of the
upper limit of the Matinal rocks is incontestably the sharpest paleeontologically
within the whole palaeozoic system of the Appalachian basin, whether we measure
it by the smallness in the proportion of the species which bridge the gulf, or by the

 Palceontological relations of the American and European Palceosoic Strata.

alteration in their types of structure. The following summary of the results of the

researches of Professor James Hall, and other skilful palaeontologists, will show the

extent of this revolution in palaeozoic life. Unluckil)^ neither Hall nor any other

naturalist, has yet advanced to an exhaustive description and enumeration of the

American species above the Scalent and Niagara series, though it is possible to

glean valuable data from his essay on the Paleeozoic Deposits of the United States

and Europe, and from other sources whereby to make the comparison between the

Cambrian -Silurian break and the other later horizons of life discontinuity.

The annexed Table presents in a summary form the palaeontological relations of

the American and European palaeozoic strata, indicating the numbers of the species

restricted to the several groups, and the numbers which are common to related ones.

It is a striking fact, bearing directly on the present inquiry, that the proportion

of organic forms common to the lower and middle palaeozoic divisions, scarcely

exceeds zero. According to Professor Hall *, the number of species now examined

from the lower palseozoics of the United States surpasses 400, and those from the

Levant, Surgent, and Scalent series, or all but the uppermost Silurian formation,

are about 344. He also statesf, that already more than 200 species have been re-

cognized in the Premeridian or Lower Helderberg limestone, from which it would

appear that the Silurian or Upper Silurian of Great Britain have yielded about 550

forms. The two sets together have thus turned out about 950 species, or nearly the

number catalogued by Professor Morris as found in the corresponding formations

Nowin the British Islands.  it is a most instructive fact, that, out of these nearly

1000 lower and middle palaeozoic fossils, only three or four, if as man}', span the

great break which divides the two groups of rocks. This complete extinction of

the earlier or Cambrian races, is a circumstance so important in the comparative

palaeontology of the two continents, that it deserves to be dwelt on sufficiently to

show the precise extent of the evidence. Professor Hall, speaking of the Medina,
Clinton, and Niagara groups, states, " In these investigations, some new facts have

been brought to light, which all the previous examinations have not shown, the

discovery of several species of fossils heretofore known only in the lower rocks, [n

the western part of the State of New York, the lower beds of the Clinton group

have furnished very dilapidated specimens of Bellerophon Irilohafus with Delthyrus

Lynx, and one or two imperfect specimens of a Leptmna undistinguishable from L.

Aallernata.  few other fragments and imperfect specimens have also been found,

which appear to be forms belonging to Lower Silurian strata. These facts are ex-

tremely important and interesting, and I take the present occasion of recording them,

from the circumstance that all our investigations previously had only strengthened

the opinion that no fossils of the lower rocks had passed the Oneida conglomerate."

  When we compare this remarkable palfeontological break, amounting to certainly

99 per cent, of all the discovered organisms from the two sets of strata, with the

synchronous break, separating the Cambrian or older Silurian from the Silurian of

Great Britain, we find a marked diflFerence in the extent of the discontinuity in the

vital stream. Sir Roderick Murchison has shown in an Appendix to his work

' Siluria,' in a Table of the vertical range of the older palaeozoic fossils, compiled

by Mr. Salter, that not less than 114 species are common to the lower and upper

groups. This number, assuming 880 as the species accessible for comparison, is

nearly 13 per cent, of the two entire faunas compared. It is obvious, therefore,

that the life-break, like the mechanical, was even more complete in the Appalachian

portion of the American paleozoic basin, than it was in the British part of the

AEuropean.   little more than one half of the 880 species enumerated by Professor

Morris, belong to the Upper Caradoc, Wenlock, and Ludlow formations, while,

according to Mr. Salter's list, 114 species, that is to say, about 22 percent., range

from the Llandeilo into these upper rocks.

  We reach a still clearer apprehension of the relative magnitudes of the American

and the British palaeontological breaks at the Matinal or Caradoc period, when we

regard for a moment the additional evidence afforded by comparing the proportionate

number of genera which pass the boundary in the two countries. According to

Professor Phillips's condensed enumeration framed from Professor Morris's Cata-

logue of British Fossils, there are restricted to the strata below the break 136

genera, and to those above it 149, while there are 74 genera common to the two
sets. In other words, the proportion of common to restricted is nearly 26 per cent.
Turning now to the American older and middle palseozoic faunas, I find, on care-
fully comparing Hall's catalogues of the fossils of the two corresponding sets of

formations (deficient, unfortunately, in any enumeration of Premeridian or latest
Silurian species), that there are restricted to

and that there are 37 genera common to the two series, the whole number of genera
being 171. Here the proportion of common to restricted is about 25 per cent. The
introduction of the Premeridian fossils, many of which are on the horizon of the
Wenlock beds of Britain, would add materially to the proportion of genera not held
in common, and would reduce the common to probably less than 20 percent. Thus
even on this broadest basis of comparison, there would seem to have been a much
more complete extinction and replacement of organic types in North America, than

occurred in Europe, or at least, in Britain.

Parallelism of the North American and European Palceozoic Rocks.

   Having examined the reciprocal relations of the Appalachian palaeozoic strata, and
also those of the European palaeozoics among themselves, as expressed by the nume-
rical proportions of their fossils, and also by the generic forms of their organic re-
mains, and learned where the stream of life was most continuous, and where most
interrupted, it remains to coordinate the deposits of the two basins with each
other. Thus may we hope to learn what formations are synchronous, and what are
without equivalents. In attempting this correlation, it should be remqpibered that
Nature presents no true or literal equivalency of strata, nor anything closer than a
mere approximate relationship where the deposits compared belong to independent
basins, or even to the remote sides of the same great receptacle. The most we can
hope to establish, is a general agreement in time with possibly a stricter synchronism
of the few chief paroxysmal movements which agitated the bed of the ancient ocean.

Partially representative formations are discoverable, but equivalent ones are not to
be looked for upon any philosophical view, since the distribution of organic beings
is essentially partial or geographical. The life horizons of the globe are no more

universal than are its horizons of sedimentation. With these reservations, we turn
to the degrees of affinity, linking the American and European palaeozoic groups of

fossils.                                               The Appalachian Primal strata

characterized by a peculiar group of Trilobites, absent from the higher formations

and by those earliest brachiopodous genera, Oholus, Lingula and Orbicula, are

obviously nearly on the horizon of Barrande's Primordial zone, and of the lowest

rocks of Russia and Scandinavia- Notwithstanding a general agreement of type,

there is not a species common to the two continents.

 --Auroral Series (Calciferous, Chasy and Black River Gi-oups). The Appalachian

Auroral strata, containing in New York alone more than 83 recognized forms, possess

but a single species, the Lituites convolvens, in common with the strata which repre-

sent them in Europe. Hall thinks that the Auroral limestones are not represented

by any British rocks, nor clearly by any European. Possibly they were approximately

contemporaneous with the Swedish Orthoceratite limestone.

 --Matinal Series (Trenton and Hudson River Groups). This group of formations,

Matinal limestone (Trenton), Matinal black slate (Utica), and Matinal shale (Hudson

River), would seem, from the testimony of the fossils, to be represented in Great

Britain by the Llandeilo flags and Caradoc sandstone, or more generally by Sedg-

wick's Bala or Upper Cambrian group. It finds also a near equivalent in the Ortho-
..                                                                                   ;

ceratite limestone of Sweden and Russia, and in the Graptolite shales. Mr. Hall,

the best American authority, states that the Caradoc sandstone is zoologically an

equivalent of the Hudson River group. While the Matinal series in New York

has afforded more than 250 forms, and the Bala group 122, there are, according to

the late Mr. Sharpe's comparison, only 12 in common. M. de Verneuil, contrasting

the American and North Europe Matinal fossils, finds only 14 in common. Still the

two faunas, though so poor in cosmopolite forms, have so many identical genera

that there can be no hesitation in admitting them to be the products of the same age.
Of the 20 species common to the American Matinal limestones and Matinal shales,

10, according to Mr. Sharpe, are also European species. This is one among many

facts showing that the most widely distributed races were those which best withstood

the revolutions betweea one formation and another. Adding together the British and

the North European species, there are only 24 or 6J per cent, found also in the Ame-

rican basin.

 --Levant Series {Medina Group). Passing the important horizon which divides the

Matinal from the Levant strata, we find that the latter, produced in an age of much

crust disturbance, contain a very limited fauna and flora, and seem not to be repre-

sented in Europe, but to have been formed in America just prior to the Wenlock

period of Great Britain.

 --Surgent and Scalent Series (or Clinton and Niagara). While the Surgent series

contains more than 100 well-defined species, 12 of them are ascertained to be Euro-

pean, and are eminently distinctive of the British Wenlock strata. But this Wen-

lock formation is equally a representative of the Scalent or Niagara of the United

States. The two together contain more than 326 species, the Surgent about 104
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

the Scalent some 222. Only 15, that is to say about 5 per cent., are common to both

but according to Hall, the Wenlock and its European continental equivalent has, at
least, 35 Niagara species. Thus we perceive that the Surgent and Scalent groups

are severally in closer affinity with the Wenlock of Europe than with each other. This

instructive fact suggests, that, during the quiet deposition of the Wenlock beds, an
important crust-movement may have occurred within the Appalachian basin, alter-

ing the conditions suitable to its marine inhabitants. The dissimilar areas which the

Surgent and Scalent deposits occupy indicate such a shifting of the Appalachian sea-
bed. These facts indicate that we cannot proceed securely in the classification of
formations until .we synchronize them widely.

 --Premeridian Series (Lower Helderherg) In the region of New York, where this

formation has been most closely examined, it has furnished Mr. Hall more than 200

species, only about 9 per cent, of which are also European, being fossils of the Wen-

lock and Dudley strata ; but Mr. Hall thinks that this number of identical forms will
be increased on a more critical comparison. Only two or three of the species, namely

the Calymene Blumenbachii, Atrypa reticularis, &c., occur in any higher or lower
stratum. Though thus insulated by its species, it is linked to the adjoining forma-

tions by possessing with them many common genera. While palseontologically it
has so little in common with the strata above and beneath it, it curiously enough

finds more than a tenth part of its organic remains in distant European formations,

in the Wenlock especially. This anomaly disappears, however, when we reflect on

the superior magnitude of the crust-movements or changes of physical geography

which seem to have taken place in the Appalachian sea. Compared with those in

the Silurian basin, Mr. Hall, agreeing with Mr. Sharpe, regards the lower Helderberg

strata as representing the Wenlock formation of England, while M. De Verneuil

considers them equivalent to the Ludlow. Hall admits the propriety of recognizing

the Niagara on the one side, and the Lower Helderberg on the other, as of Wenlock

age.

  --Meridian Series (Oriskany) This formation is still more completely insulated

from the formations above and beneath it, than any of the preceding. Its fossils,

not numerous, are exclusively its own, though they possess features linking them

somewhat with those of the next higher formations. Most American geologists,

adopting the view of their synchronism, first proposed by M. De Verneuil, regard

Wethem as the base of the American Devonian deposits.  shall see, however, that,

though nearly on this horizon, no precise coordination of any of the middle palaeo-

zoic strata of the two basins is practicable.
--186 REPORT 1856.

    Pomeridian, Cadent, and Veryent Series {Upper Helderherg, Ilamillon, and Che-

--mung Groups). These three natural, physical groups of strata, though characterized

by many peculiar fossils, are much less completely insulated from each other by
their species, than are the formations below them. It is remarkable that they are
related almost as intimately to the Silurian-Ludlow formation of England, and to
its continental equivalents, as to the European Devonian strata. Only two out of
all the Pomeridian species seem to be European ; but the general fades of the
fauna is as much Silurian as Devonian. The number of species common to the
Pomeridian and the Cadent rocks, is even less than the number which in England
pass upward from the Ludlow into the Devonian. Guided by numerical proportion

--only, we might be justified in drawing the Silurian-Devonian line, if the attempt
--at recognition of the Silurian and Devonian, as independent systems, is legitimate

at all for the Appalachian basin, at the boundary of the Pomeridian and the
Cadent. Mr. Hall, v\'ho was the first to promulgate explicitly this view of the
joint Silurian and Devonian affinities of the American Pomeridian and later strata,
reminds us, that in England there is a fusion amounting to 25 percent, of Silurian-
Ludlow fossils with Devonian in the rocks of Devonshire, or 10 per cent, of all the

Devonian species described by Professor Phillips. He justly says, " there is no
such mingling of species in the American formations." The older members of the

American Association of geologists will recollect, that, from an early day, the author,

in fellowship with his brother W. B. Rogers, contended, that we should not look for

a true equivalence between the formations of the American and European basins,
nor hope to discover either the same physical or the same palaeontological breaks
on both sides of the Atlantic ; and that therefore we were forbidden by the rules of
a sound philosophy to apply a European nomenclature to the American formations.

   Out of more than 220 or 230 species from the Cadent and Vergent (Hamilton
and Chemung) strata, about 20 are recognizable as European, Silurian and Devo-
nian forms, though Mr. Hall reduces the list to 12. He thinks that the organic
remains of the Cadent series are more closely related to those of the Ludlow forma-
tion of England, than to the European Devonian. M. De Verneuil recognizes 39
species of the Pomeridian, Cadent, and Vergent series, as belonging to the Silurian
and Devonian rocks of Continental Europe. Mr. Hall is unable to appreciate the
evidence which Avould place all these deposits in parallelism with the Devonian.

   From all the foregoing facts and statements, we arrive at this general inference,
that upon both palaeontological and physical evidence, there is no well-marked Silu-
rian-Devonian break discernible in the North American basin, no proof of an epoch

of general interruption in the life-stream, with wide crust-disturbance in the middle
palaeozoic ages, such as that which in earlier times, in the morning of the palseozoic
day, at the Cambro- Silurian transition, revolutionized alike the entire extent of the
American and European areas both in their inhabitants and in their physical geo-
graphy.

straight radiating lines ; i, a specimen of normal development, with
irregular wrinkles crossed by curved rows of spines ; j, portion of internal
margin of specimen h ; k, margin of specimen with spines partly formed,
open ; I, ditto fully developed, hollow throughout ; m, profile of specimen

beginning with regular margin, smooth, afterwards with irregular margin

and a few long spines at one corner; n, profile of smooth specimen

beginning regularly, then with difi^erent amounts of irregularity, ending

with a regular margin ; o, three specimens in profile, laid for the vertex to
