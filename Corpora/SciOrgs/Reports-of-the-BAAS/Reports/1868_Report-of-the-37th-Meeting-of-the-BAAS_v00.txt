              REPORT OP THE SCIENTIPIC EDUCATIONAL COMMITTEE. XXXIX

     Report of the Council of the British Association, presented to the
              General Committee, Wednesday, September 4, 1867.

    The Annual Reports of the Treasurer, the Parliamentary Committee, and

the Kew Committee have been received, and \viR be presented to the General

 Committee.
    At the last ileeting of the General Committee at Nottingham, the following

Resolution was adopted:

   " That the Kew Committee be authorized to discuss and make the neces-

sary arrangements with the Boai'd of Trade should any proposal be made re-
specting the superintendence, reduction, and pubHcatiou of Meteorological
Observations, in accordance with the recommendations of the Rejjort of the
Committee appointed to consider certain questions relating to the Meteorolo-
gical Department of the Board of Trade."

    The arrangements which have been made by virtue of the power thus

granted to the Kew Committee are described in detail in their Rej)ort, to

which the Council beg to refer the General Committee.
    The General Officers of the Association were requested by the Council

to inquii'e into the practicability of having lectures delivered to the Opera-

tive Classes when the Association meets in large towns. The Officers having
reported in favour of the occasional dehvery of such lectures, and having like-
wise ascertained that a lecture of the kind was desired by the Local Officers
at Dundee, the Council have requested Professor Tyndall to deliver one on
Thursday next.

    At the last Meeting of the Association, the Committee of Recommendations
referred to the Council certain Resolutions which had been adopted by the
Committees of two Sections, relative to the teaching of Natural Science in
Schools. The Council, fully impressed with the importance of the subject,
appointed a Special Committee for the purpose of inijuiring into the question,
and of preparing a report thereon. This Committee consisted of tlie General

Officers of the Association, the Trustees, the Rev. F. W. Farrar, M.A., F.R.S.,

the Rev. T. N. Hutchinson, M.A., Professor Huxley, F.R.S., Mr. Payne, Pro-
fessor Tyndall, F.R.S., and Mr. J. M. Wilson, M.A. The Council, having con-
sidered the Report presented by this Committee, adopted the recommenda-
tions contained therein, and resolved that the Rejiort be submitted to the
General Committee at Dundee.

   The Coimcil recommend that Sir Roderick Murchison, Bart., be elected a

Yice-President at the present Meeting.

    At their Meeting on the 9th of March, the Council also decided to recom-
mend for election, as a Yice-President, the late Provost Parker. They after-
wards learned, with deep regret, that death had deprived the Association of
the services of so esteemed and zealous an officer.

   The name of M. Janssen has been added to the list of Corresponding
Members.

   The Council have been informed that the Association will be invited to
hold future Meetings at Norwich, Plymouth, Exeter, Edinburgh, Liverjjool,
and Brighton.

Report of the Committee appointed by the Council of the British
   Association fur the Advancement of Science to consider the best
   means for promotinff Scientific Education in, Schools.

  A1. demand for the introduction of Science into the modern sj'stem of

education has increased so steadily during the last few years, and has re-
                                                                               --;

--xl REPOKT 1867.

ceived tlie approval of so many men of the highest eminence in every rank

and profession, and especially of those who have made the theory and prac-

tice of education their study, that it is impossible to doubt the existence of

a general, and even a national desire to facilitate the acquisition of some

scientific knowledge by boys at our Public and other Schools.

  We2. would point out that there is already a general recognition of

Science as an element in liberal education. It is encouraged, to a greater or

less degree, by the English, Scotch, and Irish Universities ; it is recognized

as an optional study by the College of Preceptors ; it forms one of the sub-

iects in the Local Examinations of Oxford and Cambridge ; and it has even

Webeen partially introduced into several Public Schools.       have added an

appendix containing information on some of these points*. But the means

at present adopted in our Schools and Universities for making this teaching

effective, are, in our opinion, capable of great improvement.

3. That general education in Schools ought to include some training in

Science is an opinion that has been strongly urged on the following grounds :

As providing the best discipline in observation and collection of facts,

in the combination of inductive with deductive reasoning, and in accu-

racy both of thought and language.

   Because it is found in practice to remedy some of the defects of the

ordinary school education. Many boys on whom the ordinary school studies

produce very slight effect, are stimulated and improved by instmction in

science ; and it is found to be a most valuable element in the education

of those who show special aptitude for literary culture.

   Because the methods and results of Science have so profoundly af-

fected all the philosophical thought of the age, that an educated man is

under a very great disadvantage if he is unacquainted with them.

Because very great intellectual pleasure is derived in after life from

even a moderate acquaintance with Science.

On grounds of practical utUity as materially affecting the present

position and future progress of civilization.

This opinion is fully supported by the popular judgment. AU who have

much to do with the parents of boys in the upper classes of life are aware

that, as a rule, they value education in Science on some or all of the grounds

above stated.

   4. There are difficulties in the way of introducing Science into schools
and we shall make some remarks on them. They will be found, we believe,

to be by no means insuperable.

First among these difficulties is the necessary increase of expense. For

if science is to be taught,  at least one additional master  must  be  appointed
                                                                                                                         ;

and it will be necessary in some cases to provide him with additional school-

rooms, and a fund for the purchase of apparatus. It is obvious that the

money which will be requisite for both the initial and current expenses, must

in general be obtained by increasing the school fees. This difficulty is a real

but not a fatal one. In a wealthy country like England, a slight increase in

the cost of education will not be allowed (in cases where it is unavoidable)

to stand in the way of what is generally looked on as an important educa-

tional reform ; and parents will not be unwilling to pay a small additional

fee if they are satisfied that the instruction in Science is to be made a reality.

Another ground of hesitation is, the fear that the teaching of Science

will injure the teaching in classics. But we do not think that there

                             * See Appendix A.
REPOai' OF THE SCIENTIFIC EDUCATIONAL COMMITTEE.                   xli

Tieed be the slightest apprehension that any one of the valuable results

of a classical education will be diminished by the introduction of Science.

It is a very general opinion, in which schoolmasters heartily concur,

that much more knowledge and intellectual vigour might be obtained

by most boys, during the many years they spend at school, than what

they do as a matter of fact obtain. It should, we think, be frankly

acknowledged, and indeed few are found who deny it, that an exclusively

classical education, however well it may operate in the case of the very

few who distinguish themselves in its curriculum, fails deplorably for

the majority of minds. As a general rule the small proportion of boys

who leave our schools for the Universities consists undeniably of those who

have advanced furthest in classical studies, and judging the existing system

of education by these boys alone, we have to confess that it frequently

ends in astonishing ignorance. This ignorance, often previously acknow-

ledged and deplored, has been dwelt on with much emphasis, and brought

into great prominence by the recent Royal Commission for Inquiry into

Weour Public Schools.  need not fear that we shall do great damage

by endeavouring to improve a system which has not been found to yield

satisfactory results. And we believe, further, that the philological abilities

of the very few who succeed in attaining to a satisfactory knowledge of

classics will be rather stimulated than impeded by a more expansive training.

Lastly, it may be objected that an undue strain wiU be piit upon the

Weminds of boys by the introduction of the proposed subjects.  would rer.ly

that the same objections were made, and in some schools are still made, to

the introduction of Mathematics and Modern Languages, and are found by

Ageneral experience to have been untenable.  change of studies, invol-

ving the play of a new set of faculties, often produces a sense of positive

relief; and at a time when it is thought necessary to devote to games so

large a proportion of a boy's available time, the danger of a general over-

pressure to the intellectual powers is very small, while any such danger in

Weindividual cases can always be obviated by special remissions.   do not

wish to advocate any addition to the hours of work in schools where it is be-

lieved that they are already as numerous as is desirable ; but in such schools
some hours a week could still be given up to science, by a curtailment of

the vastly preponderant time at present devoted to classical studies, and

especially to Greek and Latin Composition.

5. To the selection of the subjects that ought to be included in a pro-

gramme of scientific instruction in public schools we have given our best
attention, and we would make the following remarks on the principles by

which we have been guided in the selection that we shall propose.

There is an important distinction between scientific information and scien-

tific training ; in other words, between general literary acquaintance with

scientific facts, and the knowledge of methods that may be gained by

studying the facts at first hand under the guidance of a competent teacher.

Both of these are valuable ; it is very desirable, for example, that boys shoiild

have some general information about the ordinary phenomena of nature, such

as the simple facts of Astronomy, of Geology, of Physical Geography, and of

elementary Physiology. On the other hand, the scientific habit of mind,

which is the principal benefit resulting from scientific training, and which is

of incalculable value whatever be the pursuits of after life, can better be at-

tained by a thorough knowledge of the facts and principles of one science, than

by a general acquaintance with what has been said or written about many.

Both of these should co-exist, we think, at any school which professes to
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

offer tlie highest liberal education ; and at every school it will be easy to

provide at least for giving some scientific iuformatiou.

I. The subjects that we recommend for scientific information as distinguished

from training, should comj^rehend a general descrijition of the solar system

of the form and physical geography of the earth, and of such natural phe-

nomena as tides, currents, winds, and the causes that influence climate ; of the

broad facts of Geology ; of elementary Natural History, with especial reference
to the useful j^lauts and animals ; and of the rudiments of Physiology. This

is a kind of information which requires less preparation on the part of the

teacher ; and its effectiveness will depend on his knowledge, clearness, method,

and sympathy with his pupils. Nothing will be gained by circumscribing

these subjects by any general syllabus ; they may safely be left to the dis-
cretion of the masters who teach them.

II. And for scientific training we are decidedly of opinion that the

subjects which have paramount claims, are Experimental Physics, Elementary

Chemistry, and Botany.

i. The science of Experimental Physics deals with subjects which come within

the range of every boy's experience. It embraces the phenomena and laws of

light, heat, sound, electricity, and magnetism; the elements of mechanics, and

the mechanical properties of liquids and gases. The thorough knowledge of

these subjects includes the practical mastery of the apparatiis emjiloycd in their

investigation. The study of experimental physics involves the observation and

colligation of facts, and the discovery and application of principles. It is

both inductive and deductive. It exercises the attention and the memory,

but makes both of them subservient to an intellectual discipline higher than

either. The teacher can so present his facts as to make them sug-

gest the princiijles which underlie them, while, once in possession of the

principle, the learner may be stimulated to deduce from it results Avhich lie

beyond the bounds of his experience. The subsequent verification of his

deduction by experiment never fails to excite his interest and awaken his

--delight. The etfecls obtained in the class-room wiU be made the key to the

explanation of natural phenomena, of thunder and lightning, of rain and

snow, of dew and hoar-frost, of winds and waves, of atmospheric retraction

and reflexion, of the i-ainbow and the mirage, of meteorites, of terrestrial

magnetism, of the pressure and buoyancy of water and of air. Thus the

knowledge acquired by the study of experimeiital physics is, of itself, of the

highest value, while the acquisition of that knowledge brings into healthfid

and vigorous play every faculty of the learner's mind. Not only are natural
phenomena made the objects of intelligent observation, but they furnish

material for thought to wrestle with and to overcome                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        the  growth  of  intel-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

lectual strength being the sure concomitant of the enjoyment of intellectual

Wevictory.  do not entertain a doubt that the competent teacher who loves

his subject and can sympathize with his pupils, will find in experimental

physics a store of knowledge of the most fascinating kind, and an instrument

of mental training of exceeding power.

ii. Chemistry is remarkable for the comprehensive character of the training

which it aff'ords. Not only does it exercise the memory and the reasoning

powers, but it also teaches the student to gather by his own exi)eriments
and observations the facts upon which to reason.

It affords a corrective of each of the two extremes against which real

educators of youth are constantly struggling. For on the one hand it leads

even sluggish or uncultivated minds from simple and interesting observa-

tions to general ideas and conclusions, and gives them a taste of intellectual
                                                                                     ;

            REPORT OF THE SCIENTIFIC EDUCATIONAL COMMITTEE.                xliii

enjoyment and a desire for learning. On the other hand, it checks over-
confidence in mere reasoning, and shows the way in which valid extensions
of our ideas grow out of a series of more and more rational and accurate ob-

servations of external natui-e.

   It must not, however, be supposed that all so-called teaching of chemistry

produces results of this kind. Young men do occasionally come up to public

examinations with a literary acquaintance with special facts and even prin-

ciples of chemistry, sufficient to enable them to describe those facts from

some one point of view, and to enunciate the principles in fluent language,

and yet who know nothing of the real meaning of the phrases which they

have learnt. Such mere literary acquaintance with scientific facts is in

chemistry an incalculable evil to the student if he be allowed to mistake it

for science.

   ^Miether the student is to learn much or little of chemistry his very fii'st
lessons must be samples of the science. He must see the chief phenomena

which  are  described  to  him                   so that the words of each description may after-
                                              ;

wards call up in his mind an image of the thing. He must make simple ex-

periments, and learn to describe accurately what he has done, and what he

has observed. He must learn to use the knowledge which he has acquired

before proceeding to the acquisition of more ; and he must rise gradually

from well-examined facts to general laws and theories.

Among the commonest non-metallic elements and their simplest compounds

the teacher in a school will find abundant scope for his chief exertions.

iii. Botany has also strong claims to be regarded as a subject for scientific

training. It has been introduced into the regular school course at Ilugby

(where it is the first branch of Natural Science which is studied)

and the voluntary pursuit of it is encouraged at Harrow and at some other

schools Avith satisfactory results. It only requires observation, attention, and

the acquisition of some new words ; but it also evolves the powers of comparison

and colligation of facts in a remarkable degree ; of all sciences it seems to offer

the greatest facilities for observation in the fields and gardens ; and to this
must be added the fact that boys, from their familiarity with fruits, trees,

and flowers, start with a considerable general knowledge of botanical

facts. It admits therefore preeminently of being taught in the true

scientific method. The teaching of Science is made really valuable by train-
ing the learner's mind to examine into his present knowledge, to arrange and

criticise it, and to look for additional information. The science must be

begun where it touches his past experience, and this experience must be

converted into scientific knowledge. The discretion of the teacher will

best determine the range of Botany at which it is desirable to aim.

6. The modes of giving instruction in the subjects which we have I'e-

Acommended are reducible to two. I.              compulsory system of instruction

may be adopted, similar to that which exists at Eugby, where science has

now for nearly three years been introduced on precisely the same footing as

Mathematics and Modern Languages, and is necessarily taught to all boys.

II. A voluntary system may be encouraged as has been done for many years

at Harrow, where scientific instruction on such subjects as have been enume-
rated above is now given in a systematic series of lectures, on which the
attendance of all boys who are interested in them is entirely optional.

Of these systems it is impossible not to feel that the compulsory system is

the most complete and satisfactory. The experience of different schools

will indicate how it may best be adopted, and what modifications of it may be

made to suit the difi'erent school arrangements. It will often be very desirable to
      --

xliv  REPORT 1867.

supplement it by the voluntary system, to enable the boys of higher scientific

ability to study those parts of the course of Experimental Physics which

will rarely, if ever, be included in the compulsory school system. Lectures

may also be occasionally given by some non-resident lecturer with a view of

Westimulating the attention and interest of the boys.  add appendices con-

taining details of these two systems as worked at Rugby and Harrow *, and

we believe that a combination of the two would leave little or nothing to be

desired.

   The thorough teaching of the Physical Sciences at schools will not, how-
ever, be possible, unless there is a general improvement in the knowledge of
Arithmetic. At present many boys of thirteen and fourteen are sent to the
Public Schools almost totally ignorant of the elements of Arithmetic, and in
such cases they gain only the most limited and meagre knowledge of
it ; and the great majority enter ill-taught. It is a serious and lasting

injury to boys so to neglect Arithmetic in their early education ; it arises
partly from the desire of the masters of preparatory schools to send up
their boys fitted to take a good place in the classical school, and from the

indifference of the public schools themselves to the evil that has resulted.

   7. With a view to the furtherance of this scheme, we make the following

suggestions :--

   i. That in aU schools Natural Science be one of the subjects to be
taught, and that in every Public School at least one Natural Science
master be appointed for the purpose.

   ii. That at least three hours a week be devoted to such scientific instruc-

tion.

   iii. That Natural Science should be placed on an equal footing with
Mathematics and Modern Languages in affecting promotions, and in
winning honours and prizes.

   iv. That some knowledge of Arithmetic should be required for admission

into all Public Schools.

   V. That the Universities and CoUegcs be invited to assist in the intro-
duction of scientific education, by making Natural Science a subject of exa-
mination, either at Matriculation, or at an early period of a University

career.

    vi. That the importance of appointing Lecturers in Science, and off'eruig
Entrance Scholarships, Exhibitions, and Fellowships for the encourage-
ment of scientific attainments be represented to the authorities of the

Colleges.

   With reference to the last two recommendations, we would observe that,

without the cooperation of the Universities, Science can never be effectively
introduced into School education. Although not more than 35 per cent., even

of the boys at our great PubUc Schools, proceed to the University, and

at the majority of schools a still smaller proportion, yet the curriculum of
a public school course is almost exclusively prepared with reference to the
requii-ements of the Universities and the rewards for proficiency that they

offer. No more decisive proof could be furnished of the fact that the Univer-

sities and Colleges have it in their power to alter and improve the whole
higher education of England.

                               APPENDIX A.

                               I. Oxford,

    The Natural Science School at Oxford was established in the year 1853. By

recent changes the University allows those who have gained a first, second,

or third class in this school to graduate without passing the classical school,

provided they have obtained honours, or have passed in three books at least, at

the second classical examination, viz., moderations (which is usually passed

in  the  second year  of  residence)                                              honours in  this  school are thus placed
                                                                               ;

on an equality with classical honours. The first classical examination, ' re-

sponsions,' is generally passed in the first term of residence. Arithmetic and

two books of Euclid, or algebra up to simple equations, are a necessary

part of this examination.

    The University offers ample opportunities for the study of physics, che-

mistrj^, physiology, and other branches of natural science. At present only a

few of the Colleges have lecturers on this subject ; while for classics and mathe-

matics every College professes to have an adequate staff of teachers. At Christ

Church, however, a very complete chemical laboratory has been lately opened.

  A junior studentship at Christ Church and a demyship at Magdalen College,

tenable for five years, are, by the statutes of those Colleges, awarded annually

Afor proficiency in natural science.                                              scholarship, tenable for three years,

lately founded by Miss Brackenbury at BalUol College for the promotion

of the study of Natural Science, will be given away every two years. "With

the exception of Merton College, where a scholarship is to be shortly given

for proficiency in natural science, no College has hitherto assigned any

scholarships to natural science. The number of scholarships at the Colleges

is stated to be about 400, varying in annual value from £100 to £60.

"With these should be reckoned College exhibitions*, to the number of at least
220, which range in annual value from £145 to £20, and exhibitions awarded
at school, many of which are of considerable value.

    The two Burdett-Coutts geological scholarships, tenable for two years, and

of the annual value of £75, are open to all members of the University who

have passed the examination for the B.A degree, and have not exceeded

the 27th term from their matriculation. Every year a fellowship of £200 a
year, tenable for three years (half of which time must be spent on the Con-

tinent) on Dr. RadclifFe's foundation, is at present competed for by candidates

who, having taken a first class in the school of natural science, propose to

enter the medical profession.

    At Christ Church two of the senior studentships (fellowships) are awarded

for proficiency in natural science : at the examination for one of these, che-

mistry is the principal subject, and for the other physiology.

    At Magdalen College it is provided that, for twenty years from the year

1857, every fifth fellowship is assigned to mathematics and physical science
alternately. In the statutes of this and of every College in Oxford (except

Corpus, Exeter, and Lincolnf) the following clause occurs :--" The system of

   * At Magdalen College there will be twenty exhibitions tenable for five years, and of
the value of £75 a year, to be held by persons in need of support at the University ; in the
election to these, " the subjects of examination, for one exhibition at least in each year, shall
be mathematics and physical science alternately."

   t These Colleges exercised the powers of making statutes granted to them by the Oxford
University Act of 1854, 17 and 18 "Vic. cap. 81. In the statutes of Exeter College it is

provided that, in the election of Fellows, "preference shall be given to those candidates in

whom shall be found the highest moral and intellectual qualifications, such intellectual

qualifications having been tested by an examination in such subjects as the College from time
              --

REPORT 1867.

examinations shall always be siicli as shall render fellowships accessible, from
time to time, to excellence in every branch of knowledge for the time being
recognized in the schools of the University." This clause, so far as it relates
to the study of natural science, has been acted on only by Queen's College
and at Merton College, where a natural-science fellowship will be filled up

during the coui'se of the present year.

   At Pembroke College one of the two Sheppard fellows must proceed to the
degree of Bachelor and Doctor of Medicine in the University. At the late
election to this fellowship natural science was the principal subject in the
examination. The number of College fellowships in Oxford is at present

about 400.

                                                  II. Cambridge.

    It is important to distinguish, between the University and the Colleges at

Cambridge as at Oxford.
    There is a natural-science tripos in which the University examines in the

whole range of natural sciences, and grants honours precisely in the same
manner as in classics or mathematics.

   The University also recognizes the natural sciences as an alternative sub-
ject for the ordinary degree. As the regulations on this point are compara-
tively recent, it will be well to state them here.

   A student who intends to take an ordinary degree without taking honours

--has to pass three examinations during his course of three years, the first,

or previous examination, after a year's residence, in Paley, Latin, Greek,
EucUd, and arithmetic, and one of the Gospels in Greek ; the second, or gene-
ral examination, towards the end of his second year, in the Acts of the
Apostles in Greek, Latin, Greek, Latin prose composition, algebra, and ele-
mentary mechanics ; and the third, or special examination, at the end of his

--third year, in one of the following five subjects: 1. Theology; 2. Moral

Science ; 3. Law ; 4. Natural Science ; 5. Mechanism and applied science.

    In the natural-science examination a choice is given of chemistry, geology,

botany, and zoology.
    There are only five Colleges in Cambridge that take any notice of Natural

Science ; namely, King's, Cains, Sidney Sussex, St. John's, and Downing. At
King's two exhibitions have been given away partly for proficiency in this
subject; but there are no lectures, and it is doubtful whether similar exhi-
bitions will be given in future. At Cains there is a medical lecturer and
one scholarship given away annually for Anatomy and Physiology. At
Sidney Sussex two scholarships annually are given away for mathematics
and natural science ; and a prize of =£20 for scientific knowledge. There is
also a laboratory for the use of students. At St. John's there is a chemical
lecturer and laboratory ; and though at this CoUege there is no sort of exami-

nation in natural science either for scholarships or fellowships, it is believed

distinction in the subject may be taken into account in both elections.
Downing was founded with " especial reference to the studies of Law and

Medicine ;" there is a lecturer here in medicine and natural science, and in
the scholarship examinations one paper in these subjects ; no scholarship is
appropriated to them, but they are allowed equal weight with other subjects

to time shall determine." In tbe statutes of Lincoln College the following clause occurs :
" Pateat autem societas non iis tantum, qui in literis Grtecis et Latinis se profecisse pro-

baverint, sed etiam aliarum bonarum artium peritis juvenibus." And in the statutes of

Corpus Christi CoUege, " Quicunque se candidates offerant examinentur in bonis literis et

scientiis, sicut Prfesidenti et sociis videbitur."
                                                                                                                        ----                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

iu the choice of candidates. It is believed that the same principle will

govern the election to fellowships in this College, though no fellowship has

Weyet been given for honours in natural science.                                                                                                    believe that, owing to the

is under deliberation in other Colleges, and it is not improbable that the

same considerations wiU induce them to follow this example.

It must always be remembered that the practice is rare in Cambridge of

appropriating fellowships and scholarships to special subjects. At present

public opinion in the University does not reckon scientific distinction as on a

--par with mathematical or classical ; hence the progress of the subject seems

enclosed in this inevitable circle the ablest men do not study natural

science because no rewards are given for it, and no rewards are given for it

because the ablest men do not study it. But it may be hoped that the dis-

interested zeal of teachers and learners will rapidly break through this

circle                          in  that                                            case  the                           subject  may   be placed    on  a  satisfactory                                                                                                                                                             footing

   At the University of London the claims of science to form a part of eveiy
liberal education have long been recognized. At the Matriculation Exami-
nation the student is required to show that he possesses at least a popular
knowledge of the following subjects :

a.  In Mechanics:                                                                         the  composition                         and  resolution  of forces                                      the                                                                                                                              mechanical

c. In Acoustics : the nature of sound.

d. In Optics : the laws of refraction and reflection, and the formation of
   images by simple lenses.

    of the atmosphere ; composition of water, &c.

At the examination for the degree of B.A. a more extensive knowledge of

these subjects is required, and the candidate is further examined in the fol-

lowing branches of science :

/.  Astronomij                                                                      principal phenomena depending on the motion of the earth
                                                                                 :

                                                                                                                     :

    the principles of animal mechanics ; the processes of digestion, absorption,

    assimilation                                                                    the   general                            plan  of  circulation  in  the  great                                                                                                                                                                  divisions of

    actions of the nervous system ; and the organs of sense.

Besides the degree examination there is also an examination for honours

in mathematics and natural philosophy, in which, of course, a much wider

range of scientific knowledge is required.

  We would venture to remark that, if a similar elementary acquaintancG

with the general principles of sciences were required for matriculation at
xlviii  --REPORT 1867.

Oxford and Cambridge, it is certain that they woidd at once become a subject

of regular teaching in all our great public schools.
   There are also two specially scientific degrees, a Bachelor of Science and

a Doctor of Science. For the E.Sc. there are two examinations of a general
but highly scientific character. The degree of D.Sc. can only be obtained
after the expiration of two years subsequent to taking the degree of B.Sc.
The candidate is allowed to select one principal subject, and to prove his
thorough practical knowledge thereof, as well as a general acquaintance

with other subsidiary subjects.

                              IV. The College of Pkeceptoks.

    In the diploma examinations at the College of Preceptors, one branch of

science, viz. either chemistry, natural history, or physiology, is required as
a necessary subject for the diploma of Fellow. In the examinations for the

lower diploma of Associate or Liceuciate some branch of science may be
taken up by candidates at their own option. The Council recently decided
to offer a prize of three guineas half-yearly for the candidate who showed
most proficiency in science, and who at the same time obtained a second

class in the other subjects.

    In the examinations of pupils of schools, natural philosophy, chemistrj',
and natural history are optional subjects only, and are not required for a

certificate for the three classes. Two prizes are given to those candidates who

obtain the highest number of marks in these siibjects at the half-yearly
examinations ; and it is an interesting fact that last year, out of a total of
651 candidates, 100 brought up natural history, and 36 brought up che-

mistry as subjects for examination. Two additional prizes were conse-

quently awarded.

                                   V. The JFrench Schools.

    In France the " Lycees " correspond most nearly to our Public Schools, and

for many years science has formed a distinct part of their regular curriculum.

A strong im))ulse to the introduction of scientific teaching into French schools

was given by Napoleon I., and since that time we believe that no French
school has wholly neglected this branch of education. The amount of time
given to these subjects appears to average two hours in every week.

   The primary education is that which is given to all alike, whatever may be

their future destination in life, up to the age of eleven or twelve years.
After this period there is a " bifurcation " in the studies of boys. Those

who are intended for business or for practical professions lay aside Greek and

Latin, and enter on a course of " special secondary instruction." In this
course mechanics, cosmography, physics, chemistry, zoology, botany, and
geology occupy a large space; and the authorized ofticial programmes of these
studies are very full, and are drawn up with the greatest care. The remarks
and arguments of the Minister of Public Instruction (Mons. Duruy) and
others, in the " Programmes ofiiciels &c. de renseignement secondaire

special," are extremely valuable and suggestive ; and we recommend the sylla-

buses of the various subjects, which have received the sanction of the French
Government, as likely to afford material assistance to English teachers in
determining the range and limits of those scientific studies at which, in any

special system of instruction, they may practically aim. The " Enseigne-
ment secondaire special" might very safely be taken as a model of what
it is desirable to teach in the " modern departments " which are now attached

to some of our great schools.
         REPORT OF THE SCIENTIFIC EDUCATIONAL COMMITTEE.  xlix

    The boys vrho are destined to enter the learned professions continue a
classical course, in which, however, much less time is devoted to classical com-
position than is the case in our Public Schools. Nor is science by any means
neglected in this course, which is intended to cover a period of three years.
Besides the "elementary division" there are five great classes in these
schools, viz., a grammar division, an upper division, a philosophy class, and
classes for elementary and special mathematics.

    In the grammar division there is systematic instruction on the physical
geography of the globe.

    In the second class of the upper division the boys begin to be taught the
elements of zoology, botany, and geology in accordance with the ministerial
programmes ; and in the rhetoric class descriptive cosmography (which seems
to be nearly coextensive with the German Erdkunde) forms the subject of a
certain number of weekly lessons.

    In the class of philosophy, the young students are initiated into the ele-
mentary notions of physics (including weight, heat, electricity and magnetism,
acoustics, and optics) and of chemistry, in which, at this stage, the teaching
is confined to " general conceptions on air, water, oxidation, combustion, the
conditions and efi'ects of chemical action, and on the forces which result
from it."

    In the classes of elementary and special mathematics this course of scientific
training is very considerably extended ; and if the authorized programmes con-
stitute any real measure of the teaching, it is clear that no boy could pass
through these classes without a far more considerable amount of knowledge
in the most important branches of science than is at present attainable in any
English Public School.

                                 VI. The German Schools.

   In Germany the schools which are analogous to PubUc Schools in England
are the Oymnasia, where boys are prejDared for the Universities, and the
Burgerschulen or Realschulen, which were estabhshed for the most part about

thirty years ago for the pui"pose of aff"ording a complete education to those

who go into active life as soon as they leave school. An account of the

Prussian Gymnasia and Realschiilen may be seen in the Public-School Com-

mission Eeport, Appendix G ; further information may be obtained in ' Das

hohere Schulwesen in Preussen,' by Dr. Wiese, published under the sanction of
the Minister of Public Instruction in Prussia, and in the programmes issued
annually by the school authorities throughout Germany*.

   At the Gymnasia natural science is not taught to any great extent. Ac-
cording to the Prussian official instructions, in the highest class two hours,
and in the next class one hoiir, a week are allotted to the study of physics.
In the lower classes two hours a week are devoted to natural history, i. e.
botany and zoology. The results of the present training in natural science
at the Gymnasia are considered by many eminent University professors in
Germany to be unsatisfactory, owing to the insufiicient time allotted to it.

   In the Eealschulen about six hours a week are given to physics and che-
mistry in the two highest classes, and two or three hours a week to natural
history in the other classes. In these schools aU the classes devote five or
six hours a week to mathematics, and no Greek is learnt. In Prussia there
were in 1864 above 100 of these schools.

         APPENDIX B.

         On the NATUEAL-ScrENCE Teaching at Etigbt.

Before the summer of ?1864 a boy on entering Eugby might signify

his -sdsh to learn either modern languages or natural science ; the lessons
were given at the same time, and therefore excluded one another. If he
chose natural science he paid an entrance fee of £1 Is., Tvhich went to

an apparatus fund, and £o 5s. annually to the lecturer. Out of the whole

school, numbering from 450 to 500, about one-tenth generally were in the

natural science classes.                                       That

 --The changes proposed by the Commissioners were as foUows :

natural science should no longer be an alternative -vv-ith modern languages,

--but that all boys should learn some branch of it. That there should be two

principal branches, one consisting of chemistry and physics, the other of

physiology and natural histoiy, animal and vegetable ; and that the classes

in natural science should be entirely independent of the general divisions of

the school, so that boj-s might be arranged for this study exclusively accord-

ing to their proficiency in it.

   Since, owing to circumstances which it would be tedious to detail, it was

impossible to adopt literally the proposals of the Commissioners, a system

was devised, which must be considered as the system of the Commissioners

in spirit, adapted to meet the exigencies of the case.

 --The general arrangement is this, that new boys shall learn botany their

first year, mechanics their second, geology their third, and chemistry their

fourth.

In carrying out this general plan certain difficulties occui", which are met

by special arrangements depending on the peculiarities of the school system.

We need not here enter upon these details, because it would be impossible

to explain them simjily, and because any complications which occur in one

school would differ widely from those which are likely to arise in another.

Next, as to the nature of the teaching.

In botanj- the instruction is given partly by" lectures and 'partly from

Oliver's Botany. Flowers are dissected and examined by every boy, and

their parts recognized and compared in different plants, and then named.

No technical teiTas are given till a familiarity with the organ to be named

or described has given rise to their want. The terms which express the

cohesion and adhesion of the parts are gradually acquired vnitil the floral

schedule, so highly recommended by Henslow and Oliver, can be readily

worked. Fruit, seed, inflorescence, the forms of leaf, stem, root are then

treated, the principal facts of vegetable physiology illustrated, and the prin-

ciple of classification into natural orders explained, for the arrangement of
which Bentham's 'Handbook of the British Flora' is used. Contraiy to all

previous expectation, when this subject was first introduced it became at
once both popiUar and effective among the boys.

   The lectures are Ulustrated by Hcnslow's nine diagrams, and by a largo

and excellent collection of paintings and diagrams made by the lecturers and

their friends, and by botanical collections made for use in lectures. Wlion

the year's course is over, such boys as show a special taste are invited to

take botanical waUcs with the piincipal lecturer, to refer to the School Hcr-

bariimi, and are stimulated by prizes for advanced knowledge and for dried

collections, both local and general.

In mechanics the lecturer is the senior Natiiral Science Master. The

lectures include experimental investigations into the mechanical powers, with
                                                 ;

numeroiis examples worked by the boys ; into the elements of mechanism,

conversion of motion, the steam-engine, the equilibrium of roofs, bridges,

strength of material, &c. They are illustrated by a large collection of
models, and are very effective and popular Icctiires.

    The lectures in geology arc undertaken by another master. This subject is
only temporarily introduced, on account of the want of another experimental
school. "WTien this is buUt the third year's course ·will be some part of experi-
mental physics, for which there already exists at Eugby a fair amount of appa-
ratus. |It is veiy desirable that boys should obtain some knowledge of geology,
but it is not so well fitted for school teaching as some of the other subjects on
several grounds. Perhaps a larger proportion of boys are uiterested in the
subject than in any other ; but the subject presupposes more knowledge and
experience than most boys possess, and their work has a tendency to become

either supei-ficial, or undigested knowledge derived from books alone. The
lectures include the easier part of LyeU's Principles, i. e. the causes of change
now in operation on the earth ; next, an account of the phenomena observ-
able in the crust of the earth, stratification and its disturbances, and the
construction of maps and sections ; and, lastly, the liistoiy of the stratified
rocks and of life on the earth. These lectures are illustrated by a fair geo-
logical collection, which has been much increased of late, and by a good col-
lection of diagrams and views to illustrate geological phenomena.

   Por chemistry the lecturer has a convenient lecture-room and a small but
well-fitted laboratory*, and he takes his classes through the non-metallic and
the metallic elements : the lectures are fuUy illustrated by experiments. Boys,
whose parents wish them to study chemistry more completely, can go through
a complete course of practical analysis in the laboratory, by becoming private
pupils of the teacher. At present twenty-one boys are studying analysis.

    This being the matter of the teaching, it remains to say a few words on
the manner. This is nearly the same in all the classes, mutatis mutandis :
the lecture is given, interspersed with questions, illustrations, and experi-
ments, and the boys take rough notes, which are recast into an intelligible
and presentable form in note-books. These aro sent up about once a fort-
night, looked over, corrected, and returned ; and they form at once the test of

how far the matter has been understood, the test of the industry, care, and

attention of the boy, and an excellent subject for their English composition.
    Examination papers are given to the sets every three or foiir weeks, and

to these and to the note-books marks are assigned which have weight in the
promotion from form to form. The marks assigned to each subject are pro-
portional to the number of hours spent iu school on that subject.

    There are school prizes given annually for proficiency in each of the branches
of natural science above mentioned.

    This leads us, lastly, to speak of the results.

    Pirst, as to the value of the teaching itself ; secondly, as to its effects on
the other branches of study.

 --The experience gained at Rugby seems to point to these conclusions : That

botany, structural and classificatory, may be taught with great effect and

interest a large ntunber of boys, and is the best subject to start with. That
its exactness of terminology, the necessity of care in examining the flowers,
and the impossibility of superficial knowledge are its first recommendations
and the successive gradations in the generalizations as to the unity of type
of flowers, and the principles of a natural classification, are of great value to

    * Anotliei- and larger laboratory and school for Experimental Physics will shortly be
built at Eugby.

                                                                         d2

the cleverer boys. The teaehiug must he based on personal examination
of flowers, assisted by diagrams, and everything like cram strongly dis-

couraged.

   Mechanics are found rarely to be done -well by those who are not also the

best mathematicians. Eut it is a subject which in its applications interest

many boys, and would be much better done, and would be correspondingly

more profitable, if the standard of geometry and arithmetic were higher than

it is. The ignorance of arithmetic which is exhibited by most of the new

boys of fourteen or fifteen would be very surprising, if it had not long since
ceased to surprise the only persons who are acquainted with it ; and it forms

the main hindrance to teaching mechanics. Still, under the circumstances,

the results are fairly satisfactory.

   The geological teaching need not be discussed at length, as it is temporary,
at least in the middle school. Its value is more literary than scientific. The
boys can bring neither mineralogical, nor chemical, nor anatomical know-
ledge ; nor have they observed enough of rocks to make geological teaching
sound. The most that they can acquire, and this the majority do acquire,
is the general outline of the history of the earth and of the agencies by

which that history has been effected, with a conviction that the subject is
an extremely interesting one. It supplies them with an object rather than

with a method.
   Of the value of elementary teaching in chemistry there can be only one

opinion. It is felt to be a new era in a boy's mental progress when he has

realized the laws that regulate chemical combination and sees traces of order

amid the seeming endless variety. But the number of boys who get real

hold of chemistiy ft-om lectures alone is small, as might be expected from the

nature of the subject.

   Of the value of experimental teaching in physics, especially pneumatics,
heat, acoustics, optics, and electricity, there can be no doubt. Nothing but
impossibilities would prevent the immediate introduction of each of these
subjects in turn into the Hugby curriculum.

   Lastly, what are the general results of the introduction of scientific teach-

ing in the opinion of the body of masters ? In brief it is this, that the school
as a whole is the better for it, and that the scholarship is not worse. The
number of boys whose industry and attention is not caught by any school
study is decidedly less ; there is more respect for work and for abilities in

the different fields now open to a boy ; and though pxirsued often with great

vigour, and sometimes with great success, by boys distinguished in classics,

it is not found to interfere with their proficiency in classics, nor are there

any symptoms of overwork in the school. This is the testimony of classical

masters, by no means specially favourable to science, who are in a position
which enables them to judge. To many who would have left Rugby with
but little knowledge, and little love of knowledge, to show as the results of

their two or three years in our middle school, the introduction of science

into  our  coiu'se  has  been  the  greatest  possible  gain                                 and others who have
                                                                                          :

left from the upper part of the school, without hope of distinguishing them-

selves in classics or mathematics, have adopted science as their study at the

Universities. It is believed that no master in Eugby School would wish to

give up natural science and recur to the old cui'riculum.

                          APPENDIX C.

                         On the Teaching of Science at Haeeow School.

From this time forward natural science will be made a regular subject for

systematic teaching at Harrow, and a natural science master has been

appointed.

But for many years before the Royal Commission for Inquiiy into the

Public Schools had been appointed, a voluntary system for the encouragement

of science had been in existence at Harrow. There had been every term

a voluntary examination on some scientific subject, which, together with the

text-books recommended, was announced at the end of the previous term.

Boys from all parts of the school offered themselves as candidates for these

voluntary examinations, and every boy who acquitted himself to the satisfac-

tion of the examiners (who were always two of the masters) was rewarded

with reference to what could be expected from his age and previous attain-

ments. The text-books were selected' with great care, and every boy really

interested in his subject could and did seek the private assistance of his tutor

or of some other master. The deficiencies of the plan, if regarded as a sub-

stitute for the more formal teaching of science, were too obvious to need

pointing  out            yet its results were so  far satisfactory that many old  Harro-
                      ;

vians spoke of it with gratitude, among whom are some who have since de-

voted themselves to science with distinguished success.

   One of the 7nain defects of this plan (its want of all system) was remedied a
year ago, when two of the masters drew vip a scheme, which was most readily

adopted, by which any boy staying at Harrow for three years might at least

have the opportunity during that time of being introduced to the elementaiy

conceptions of astronomy, zoology, botany, structural and classificatory, che-

mistry, and physics. These subjects were entrusted to the responsibility of

eight of the masters, who drew up with great care a syllabus on the subject

for each term, recommend the best text-books, and give weekly instruction
(which is perfectly gratuitous) to all the boys who desire to avail themselves

of it ; indeed a boy may receive, in proportion to the interest which he
manifests in the subject, almost any amount of assistance which he may care

to seek. Proficiency in these examinations is rewarded as before ; and to

encourage steady perseverance, the boys who do best in the examination du-

ring a course of three terms receive more valuable special rewards.

As offering to boys a voluntary and informal method of obtaining much

scientific information this plan (which was originated at Harrow, and has

not, so far as we are aware, been ever adopted at any other school) offers
many advantages. It is sufficiently elastic to admit of many modifications

it is sufficiently comprehensive to attract a great diversity of tastes and incli-

nations ; it cannot be found oppressive, because it rests with each boy to decide
whether he has the requisite leisure or not ; it can be ado2)ted with ease at
any school where even a small body of the masters are interested in one or

other special branch of science ; and it may tend to excite in some minds a

more spontaneous enthusiasm than could be created by a compulsory plan

alone.

  We would not, however, for a moment recommend the adoption of any such

plan as a substitute for more regular scientific training. Its chief value is
purely sup-plemental, and henceforth it will be regarded at Harrow as entirely

subordinate to the formal classes for the teaching of science which will be

immediately established.

In addition to this, more than a year ago some of the boys formed them-

selves into a voluntary association for the pursuit of science. This Scientific
Society, which numbers upwards of thii-ty members, meets every ten clays at
the hoiise and under the presidency of one or other of the masters. Objects
of scientific interest are exhibited by the members, and papers are read gene-

rally on some subject connected witli natural history. Under the auspices of
this Society the nucleus of a future museum has already been formed ; and
among other advantages the Society has had the honour of numbering among
its visitors more than one eminent representative of literatiu'c and science.
AVe cannot too highly recommend the encouragement of such associations for
intellectual self-culture among the boys of our public schools.

    Report of the Kew Committee of the British Association for the

                         Advancement of Science for 1866-67.

   The Committee of the Kew Observatory submit to the Council of the British

Association the following statement of their proceedings during the past

year :--
   At the Nottingham Meeting it was resolved, " That the Kew Committee

be authorized to discuss and make the necessary arrangements with the Board
of Trade, should any proposal be made respecting the superintendence, reduc-
tion, and pubhcation of Meteorological observations, in accordance with the
recommendations of the Bcport of the Committee appointed to consider cer-
tain questions relating to the Meteorological Department of the Board of

Trade."

   On the 18th of October last, a joint Meeting of the Kew Committee, and

of the President, Vice-Presidents, and other Officers of the Royal Society, took
place, to take into consideration a communication which had been received
by the President of the Royal Society from the Board of Trade relative to
the Meteorological Department, and to consider what reply should be sent.

    At this joint Meeting it was recommended that the Department imder
whose care the Meteorological observations, reductions, and tabulations are
to be made shoidd be imder the direction and control of a Superintending
Scientific Committee, who should (subject to the approval of the Board of
Trade) have the nomination to all appointments, as well as the power of
 dismissing the usual officials receiving salaries or remimeration. It was also
understood that while the ser\ices of the Committee were to bo gratuitous,
 they would yet necessarily require the services and assistance of a competent

 paid Secretary.
     Finally, the draft of a reply to the above-mentioned communication from

 the Board of Trade was agreed to at this Meeting, for consideration of tho
 Council of the Royal Society.

    The CouncU of the Royal Society, on 13th Dec. 1866, nominated the following
 Fellows of the Society as the Superintending Meteorological Committee :
General Sabine, Pres. R.S., Mr. Do la Rue, Mr. Francis Galton, Mr. Gassiot,

 Dr. W. A. MiUer, Captain Richards (Hydrographer of the Admiralty), Colonel

 Smythc, and Mr. Spottiswoode ; and on the 3rd of January this Committee
 appointed Mr. Balfour Stewart as its Secretary, on the understanding that

he should, with the concurrence of the Kew Committee of the British Associa-
tion, retain his present office of Superintendent of the Kew Observatoiy.

   It was also proposed that Kew Observatory should become the Central

 Observatory, at which aU instruments used by or prepared for the several
 observatories or stations connected with the Meteorological Department shoidd

--be verified, the entire expense attendant thereon, or any futiu-e expense

arising through the connexion of the Observatory with the Meteorological
Department being paid from the funds supplied by the latter, and not in any

way from money subscribed by the British Association, These proposals

having been submitted to the Kew Committee, they approved of the Kew

Observatory being regarded as the Central Observatory of the Meteorological

Depai-tment, and of Mr. Stewart's holding the oifice of Secretary to the
Scientific Committee superintending that Department.

   "When the Meteorological Department was placed under the superinten-
dence of a Scientific Committee, one of the main objects contemplated was

the establishment of a series of meteorological observatories, working in unison

with the Kew Observatory, provided with similar self-recording instruments,

and distributed throughout the country ra such a manner that by their means
the progress of meteorological phenomena over the British Isles might be re-
corded with great exactness.

For this piu-pose it was proposed to have observatories in the following

places :

          Kew (Central Observatory).  Aberdeen (probably).
                                      Armagh.
          Falmouth.

          Stonyhurst.                 Valencia.

          Glasgow.

   Such a plan of course involves an additional annual expenditure ; but, the
appointment of a Committee having been sanctioned in the fii'st instance by
the Government, and the estimates attendant thereon afterwards by the

House of Commons, the arrangement may now be regarded as established,
without iavolving any additional expense to the British Association. The

consequence wiU. be a considerable access of work to Kew Observatoiy,

and the duties now undertaken by that establishment may, for clearness'

sake, be considered imder the two following heads :

     (A) The work done by Kew Observatory under the Direction of the

                    British Association.

      (B) That done at Kew as the Central Observatory of the Meteorological

                  Committee.

   This system of division will be adopted in what follows of this Eeport.

 --1. Magnetic. The Self-recording Magnetographs ordered by the Vic-

toria Government for Mr. Ellery, of Melboiu-ne, have been verified at Kew,
and dispatched to Melbourne, where they have arrived. They will, it is be-

lieved, be very shortly in continuous action.

   It was mentioned in the last Eeport that a set of Self-recording Magneto-

graphs ordered by the Stonyhurst Observatory had been verified at Kew and

dispatched to their destination. These instruments are now in action at
Stonyhurst, under the direction of the Eev. W. Sidgreaves.

   Mr. Meldrum, of the Mauritius Observatory, who is now in this country,

has received at Kew instruction in the various processes of that establish-

ment. His SeK-recording Magnetograi)hs have been verified in his presence,

and they are now in the hands of the optician, who is awaiting Mr. Meldrum 's

instructions regarding them.

   It is hoped that very soon a considerable number of Magnetographs after

the Kew pattern will be in continuous operation at different parts of the
--Ivi REPORT 1867.

world; and as during the nest two or three years magnetic disturhances

may he expected to increase, it will he interesting to institute comparisons

between the simultaneous records produced hy these various instruments.
    The usual monthly absolute determinations of the magnetic elements con-

tinue to be made by Mr. "Whipple, magnetic assistant; and the Self-record-
ing Magnetographs are in constant operation as heretofore, also under Mr.
Whipple, who has displayed much care and assiduity in the discharge of his

duties.

   The photographic department connected with the self-recording instruments
is under the charge of Mr. Page, who performs his duties very satisfactorily.

   The observations made for the purpose of determining the temperature
coefficients of the horizontal-force and vertical-force magnetographs have

been reduced.
    In order to obviate the chance of any break in the continuity of the series

of absolute magnetic determinations made at Kew which might arise from

a change of the magnetic assistant, the Superintendent has commenced taking
quarterly observations of the dip and horizontal force, with the ^dew of cor-
recting any change in personal equation which might be produced by change

of assistant.

   The magnetic curves produced at Kew previously to the month of Ja-

nuary 1865, have all been measured and reduced under the direction of
General Sabine, by the staff of his ofiRcc at Woolwich, and the results of this
reduction have been communicated by General Sabine to the Eoyal Society

in a series of interesting and valuable memoirs. It is now proposed that the

task of tabulating and reducing these curves since the above date be perfonned

--by the staff at Kew working under the direction of Mr. Stewart.
   2. Meteorological tvork. The meteorological work of the Observatory con-
tinues in charge of Mr. Baker, who executes his duties very satisfactorily.

    Since the Kottingham Meeting 89 Barometers have been verified ; 608
Thermometers have likewise been verified, and two Standard Thermometers
have been constructed at the Observatory.

   The Self-recording Barograph continues in constant operation, and traces
in duplicate are obtained, one set of which is regailarly forwarded to the

Meteorological Office.

  A Self-recording Barograph and Thermograph on the new Kew pattern

about to be made for Mr. EUery of Melbourne, and a Self-recording Baro-
graph for Mr. Smalley of Sydney, will be verified at the observatory before

they are dispatched to their destination.

   The Anemometer is in constant operation as heretofore.
    Dr. E. Coleridge Bowles, before he proceeded to Pekin, received meteorolo-
gical instruction at Kew.
   The weU-known apparatus employed for so long a time by Mr. Robert
Addams for liquefying carbonic acid, has been purchased by Mr. Stewart from
funds supplied by the Eoyal Society ; and Mr. Addams has kindly under-
taken to make a preliminary experiment with his apparatus, as well as to
give specific instructions regarding it. As the exact thermometric value of the
freezing-point of mercury has been previously determined by Mr. Stewart, it
is expected that the apparatus will furnish the means of verifying thermo-
meters at very low temperatures.
   At the request of the Meteorological Committee, several Aneroids have
been obtained from the best -known makers of these instruments, and, by
means of an apparatus constructed by Mr. Beckley for this purpose, they
have been compared with a standard Barometer at different pressures, being

meanwhile tapped so as to imitate as well as possible the tapping by the
hand which these instruments are usually subjected to previously to the read-

ings being taken.

   These experiments show that, while Aneroids cannot be considered equal

in accuracy to standard Barometers, yet the best-constructed Aneroids, within

--certain limits, give reliable results.
   3. Photoheliograph. The Kew Heliograph, in charge of Mr. De la Eue,

continues to be worked in a satisfactory manner. During the past year 204

negatives have been taken, on 144 days. Pictures of the Pagoda in Kew

Gardens are regularly taken by this instrument, in the hope that by this

means the angular diameter of the Sun may be satisfactoiily determined.

Since the last Meeting of the Association, a second scries of solar researches,

in continuation of the first series, has been published (the expense of print-

ing having been defrayed by Mr. De la Eue), entitled " Eesearches in Solar
Physics, Second Series, Area Measurements of the Sun-spots observed by

Mr. Carrington during the seven years 1854-1860 inclusive, and deduc-

tions therefrom. By Messrs. De la Eue, Stewart, and Loewy."
   The Heliographic latitudes and longitudes of all the spots recorded by the

Kew Photoheliograph during the years 1862 and 1863 have been calculated,
and it is hoped that the results may soon be published, forming a thii'd

series of Solar Eesearches. It is believed that these results will demon-

strate the superiority of photographic pictures over all other methods of

observation.

   The sum of <£60 has been obtained from the Government Grant fund of the

Eoyal Societj', to be applied to the discussion of Hofratli Schwabe's long and

valuable series of Sun-spots, at present in the possession of Kew Observatory.

These pictures are now being examined with this object.
   Sun-spots continued likewise to be numbered after the manner of Hofratli

Schwabe, and a table exhibiting the monthly groups observed at Dessau and

at Kew for the year 1866 has already appeared in the Monthly Notices of the

Astronomical Society, vol. xxvii. No. 3.

  --4. Ajyparatus for verifying Sextants. The apparatus constructed by

Mr. Cooke, for verifying Sextants, has for some time been erected at the
Observatory ; and a description of it has been communicated by Mr. Stewart
to the Eoyal Society, and published in their ' Proceedings,' vol. xvi, p. 2.

  --Seven Sextants have been verified during the past year.

   5. MisceUaneous worJc. The preliminaiy observations with Captain Kater's
pendulum, alluded to in last year's Eeport, have been made ; but the reduc-

tions are not yet quite finished.

   An account of certain experiments on the heating of a disk by rapid rota-

tion in vacuo has been communicated to the Eoyal Society by Mr. Stewart
in conjunction with Professor Tait, and has been published in the 'Pro-

ceedings ' of that body.

   The instrument devised by Mr. Broun for the purpose of estimating the
magnetic dip by means of soft iron, remains at present at the Observatory,
awaiting Mr. Brouu's return to England.

    During the past year two standard yards for opticians have been compared

with the Kew standard.
   Several instruments, chiefly magnetic, have been sent to Kew by General

Sabine from his office at Woolwich.
   The Superintendent has received grants from the Eoyal Society for special

experiments ; and when these are completed an account will be rendered to

that Society.

                                  Meteorological Committee,

    Mr. Stewart, as Director of the Central Meteorological Observatory, having
been called ixpou to arrange the self-recording instruments required by the
Meteorological Committee, has obtained the cooperation of Mr. Becklcy, me-

chanical assistant at Kew, from whom he has derived very great aid, and in

conjunction with him has arranged the Self-recording Thermograph and
Barograph which have been adopted by the Meteorological Committee.

 --The following are the chief characteristics of these instruments :

    Tliermogmpli. In this instrument an air-speck, formed by a break in the
mercurial column of a thermometer, allows the light of a gas-lamp to pass
through it, yielding an image that is obtained on a revolving cylinder covered

with photographic paper.

As the cylinder revolves once in forty-eight hoiu's, and as the thermometric

column rises and falls, these motions delineate a curve, by means of which

the temperature of the thermometer is denoted from moment to moment.

There would bo but one curve if there were only one thermometer ; in

practice there are two, the dry and wet bulb, the object of the first being

to register the temperature of the air, and of the second to register that

of evaporation. In this Thermograph the simultaneous records of these two

thermometers are obtained, the one under the other, on the same sheet of

Wepaper.  have thus an under curve denoting the readings of the wet-bulb

thermometer, and a curve above it denoting those of the dry-bixlb thermo-

meter.

An arrangement connected with the clock of this instrument has been

proposed and executed by Mr. Beckley, by means of which the light is cut

Aolf from the sensitive paper for foiu' minutes every two houi'S.  small

break is thus produced every two hours on each curve, by means of which

the time of any phenomenon may be easily ascertained. By drawing lines

through the simultaneous breaks of the wet and dry-bulb ciu'ves, a series

of lines is obtained perpendicular to the direction of motion of the cylinder,

which serves the purposes of a zero-line. Lastly, a Kew Standard Ther-

mometer, similar in size and figure to those of the Thermograph, and placed

between them (outside the house), is used as the standard of reference, and,

as such, is read (by eye) five or six times a day. By this means an independent

determination of the temperature of the air may bo obtained from time to

time.

   The Thermograph has been for some time ready to commence continuous
registration. Hitherto this has been delayed with the view of making ex-
periments designed to improve the working of the instrimient, because uj) to

the present time these improvements could be easily adapted to the other
instruments in course of construction. It is intended to commence the regular

--working of the instrument before the beginning of September.
   Barograph. The arrangement for cutting ofl^ the light every two hours, and
the precaiition of comparing the observations with those of a standard instru-
ment, read five or six times a day, will be introduced in the Barograph as
well as in the Thermograph. The correction of the Barograph for tempe-
rature is the only thing to which it is necessary to allude. Here the curve
denotes an uncorrected Barometer : the zero-line is not a straight line, but
is formed by the interception of the light from the cylinder by a stop which,
by means of a lever arrangement, rises and falls with temperature as much
as the barometric column rises and falls from the same cause ; that is to

say, in order to find tlie true height of the harometer, we measure between

the zero-line and the line denoting the top of the uncorrected column, since,

when the top of the column rises or falls through temperature, the zero-
hne rises or falls just as much. This mode of correction, although sufficient

for most purposes, cannot yet be absolutely perfect ; a httle reflection will,

however, show that the curved zero-line may not only be used as the

means of correcting the readings of the instrument, but also as giving the actual
temperature of the mercurial column from moment to moment, so that the

true temperature-correction may with very little trouble be obtained and

applied.

   A comparison of the curves of the old Kew Barograph at present in

operation, with those of the Oxford Barograph, has shown that there is
probably a slight adhesion of the mercury to the sides of the tube of the
former instrument ; moreover the instrument is not in all respects the same

as those about to be supplied to the other observatories. It has therefore

--been resolved that one of the new instruments shall be substitiited for it.
    Anemometer. This instrument is a modification of Dr. Hobinson's. Its

--time-scale corresponds in length with those of the Thermograph and Baro-

graph, the object of having all the time-scales of the same length being to
obtain the means of accurately placing the simultaneous records of the
different instruments, one under the other, on the same sheet of paper. The
present Anemometer wiU have to be altered, as it is not self-recording for
direction ; and it is then intended to support it above the moveable dome of
the Observatory so as to be independent of it.

    In order to fit the Observatory for the pui-poses of the Meteorological
Committee, one of the outhouses, at present only occasionally used for the veri-
fication of Magnetographs, has been altered so as to make it also available for

the verification of meteorological self-recording instruments ; this, together

with the addition of a small brick building outside, wiU be siifficient for the

purposes of the Meteorological Committee. When this building is completed

it will receive all the moveable iron at present in the Observatory; this
arrangement will at the same time set free the present workshop, additional
room being required for the increasing work of the Observatory.

Rejwrt of the Parliamentary Committee to the Meeting of the British
                         Association at Dundee, Sejitember 1867.

   The Parliamentary Committee have the honour to report as follows :
   Tour Committee have to express their regret that the Pubhc Schools Bill

has again failed to obtain the sanction of the Legislatiu'e ; but it is a subject
for congratulation that the discussions in Parliament and elsewhere, which

have followed its introduction, have already borne fruit. The attention of
the public appears to have been awakened to the necessity for introducing
scientific teaching into our Schools, if we are not wUling to sink into a con-
dition of inferiority as regards both intellectual culture and skill in art when
compared with foreign nations. The vokmtary efi^orts of the Masters of two
of oui- great schools to add instruction in Natiual Science to the ordinary
Classical course are desei-ving of aU praise ; and some evidence of their sue-

cess may be derived from the interesting fact, disclosed in the able Report

of the Committee appointed by the Council of the Association to consider this

subject, that some of the boys at Harrow have formed themselves into a

voluntary Association for the piu'suit of Science.

Your Committee have communicated to the Lord Chancellor the Reports of

the Committee  on   Scientific  Evidence  in  Courts  of  Law                     and  his  Lordship
                                                                               ;

has promised to consider the subject during the recess.

The Chairman of your Committee has also lately been in communication

with the President of the Board of Trade, with the object of prevailing

on the Government to amend the unsatisfactory provisions now in force,

under the authority of the Merchant Shipping Act, for securing the proper

adjustment of the Compasses of the iron-built ships of the Mercantile Marine.

This measui'e was strongly and ably advocated by the President and

Council of the Royal Society, in a correspondence which passed between

them and the Board of Trade in 1865, but hitherto without success.

The Report now presented contains an account of the proceedings of the

Lunar Committee during the past Association year. These proceedings have

--reference to the following subjects : First, the registration of craters and

other visible objects. Secondly, the construction of an outline map. And

--thirdly, an examination of an alleged change upon the surface of the moon.
   The Registration of Objects. In connexion with this head nothing has

transpired during the past year to render necessary any addition to the plan
proposed by the Committee in 1865. The mode of registration was treated
very fully in the Report presented at Birmingham, and published in the

volume of Reports for 186.5, pp. 287-300.

   The number of objects now registered are as follows :

       514 on 124 Areas in Quadrant I.

       349 ,,  86   ,,,,      II.

--The Outline Map. During the past year the Committee authorized the

engraving and printing of Areas IV A* and IV^, also the printing of the

catalogue of objects inserted on those areas, and the distribution of copies to
gentlemen taking part in the work. As the printing was com]deted, and
the issue had commenced before the last Report had gone to press, it was
considered advisable, in order to give them greater circulation, to append
these areas and catalogue to that Report. They form Appendix III., Report,
1866, pp. 239-280.

   The Committee, recognizing the great importance of obtaining periodical
examinations of the moon's disk, suggested that the entire surface should be

divided into subzones of 1° of latitude (Report, 1866, p. 240), and allotted to

1867.          ^^                               a

gentlemen willing to cooperate in the work. The two areas at present
issued embrace 10 degrees of latitude, and the allotment has been so arranged
that each purr of subzones overlap and dovetail into the adjoining pairs.
In Appendix III. to the last Heport, the objects in each pair of subzones are

specified in the order of their conspicuousness (sec Eeport, 1866, p. 241).

The following subzones have been allotted as imder :

    Several rctui-ns have been received, but they are not yet in a state fit for

publication.

   It has been proposed that, previous to publishing any returns, that may
be made to the Committee, the objects reported by the several observers

shall be re-examined by Mr. Birt, or by some other gentleman on behalf of the
Committee, with the aid of a telescope of superior power. The annual grant,

which the Committee request may be renewed, is uot available for supplj-ing

an instrument suitable for this puiiDose, as it is necessarilj' expended in
earryiug on tlie work of mapping, registration, &c. Nevertheless' the Com-

mittee hope that aid may be afforded by which this desii-able object may be

attained, as, by the use of such an instrument, an authority will be given to
the work of a kind which it would not other^dse possess.

 --Alleged Change on the Moon's Surface. On the 27th of November

186G, the Committee received a communication from Herr Schmidt, Di-

rector of the Observatory at Athens, announcing that a remarkable change
had taken place in the crater " Linne." The importance of this communi-

cation was at once apparent, as bearing in one direction on on interesting

question on lunar physics, and in another on the labom-s of tlie Committee.

Two years ago the Committee urged the necessity of so registering an object

that it might ever after, in all time, be sufficiently identified by all future

observers (Eeport, 1865, p. 294). Tlie announcement of Schmidt suggests a

modification                                                               for  if  a  change                                                 sufficiently extensive should  take  place  in  any

object, the condition of which had been definitely settled by more than one

observer, it might be difficult to identify it as the same object, but the value

of the determination of its former condition would be increased, both deter-

minations being equally good. In the particular case of " Linne," it is only

in the latter part of 1866, and up to September 1867, that its real state may

be regarded as settled upon the testimony of numerous observers, whose

observations fairly agree among themselves. With regard to its former

state there is some doubt, in consequence of real or supposed inexactitude in

previous observations, from which it is difficult to arrive at a conclusion;
an earlier observation agreeing (in the opinion of most astronomers) with

its present appearance, while others of a later date are ii-reconcileablc with

it. In the present state of Selenography a record of its real condition at any

particular epoch is so obviously important that nearly the whole of the obser-

vations, both early and recent, that have come into the possession of the

Committee, are given in an appendix ; those not inserted are mere repetitions

of similar features.

Herr Tempel's opinion of the round white spots on the moon's surface

(analogous to the appearance which Linne now presents) being of interest

for the existence of a chemicalhf warm activiti/ (Astronomische Nachrichten,

No. 1655, translated by W. T. Lynn, B.A., F.R.A.S., Astronomical Eegister,

No. 58, p. 219), demands attention. These spots, which are very numerous,

have usually been considered as ground-markings, but as Linne, in 1788,
and in 1866-67, presented a similar appearance, they will in future com-

mand more attention.

a letter of Professor Miidler in English, dated 18G7, June 6.

   "The crater Linne, situated in 27° 47' 13" N. lat., and 11° 32' 28" W.

long., has a diameter of 1-4 geographical miles (6-4 English miles). In full

moon the edge of it is not very sharply limited, but in oblique illumination

it is very distinct, and I have measured it seven times with great facility.
The light of the edge is noted permanently 6° ; the very small inner space

--has nearlj', or full the same brightness till the moment when shadows begin."

                 --Eecent Observations Results.

   1°. An ill-defined white spot, not unlike a cloud, greater in extent than the

crater of Lohrmann, Beer and Miidler, and Schmidt.

  A2°. large shallow crater that has been very rarely seen.
  A3°. small crater within the shallow crater, first seen as a crater by Father

Secchi on Feb. 11, 1867.
    These appearances of Linne have not been recorded previously as co-

existing*.

                            Observations of the White Spot.

   These have been very numerous. No doubt whatever has been cast on
this appeai'ance of Linne since Oct. 15, ISfiG. The only question that exists

has reference to the variability or invariability of its size, and probably of its
reflective power.

merely the dates of these observations except the fii-st, in which Schmidt
speaks of his missing for the first time the crater-form of Linne.

is called y by Madlee. For the first time did I miss Linuc, or rather its
crater-form, which at that time ought to have sho-svn with especial distinct-

ness and deeply shadowed.

    Schmidt obserTcd Linuc as a spot of light onhj, more or less similar to y
Posidonius, on the undermentioned days: 1860, Oct. IS ; Nov. 14, 17, 19,

22, 23, 24, and 2-5. On Nov. 26 ho recorded " no trace of Linne."' He also

observed it as alight-spot on Dee. 14-16 (and following evenings), 2.5, and 27.

On Dec. 27 he speaks of it as "inconsiderable." 1S67, Jan. 13, 14 to 19,

and 24, he still observed it as a light-spot or small white cloud. A\?,o on

May 23, he estimated it at 0-6 of Sulpicius Gallus ; May 24, estimated at 0-25

of S. Galliis ; June 22, 0-33 of S. Gallus ; and July 9, as the usual spot of

light.

   M. Flammarion observed the white spot on May 10, 1867, and described

it as under (Comptes Eendus, tom. Ixiv. 20 Mai, 1867, ISTo. 20, p. 1020.)

He does not appear to have seen either the large shallow crater, or the small

crater or hUl which were observed on the same day by Eespighi and Schmidt.
   " Une observation attentif montre immediatement que Linne n'est plus un

cratere. Aucuue ombre exterieure a I'est, aucune ombre au centre. En sa

place il n'y a plus maintenant qu'une nuee blanche circulaire, ou plutot une

tache blanche attenant au sol, laquelle, loin de s'elever comme un cratere

sur le fond un pen verdati-e de la mer de la Serenite parait n'etre ni en relief

--ni en creux et ressemble a un lac plus claire que la plaine avoisinante."
   Trmislntwn. An attentive observation shows immediately that Liane is
no longer a crater. No exterior shadow to the east, no shadow at the centre.
In its place there is now nothing more than a white circular cloud, or rather

a white spot contiguous to the ground, which, so far from elevating itself as a
crater on the slightly greenish ground of the Mare Serenitatis, appears neither

to be in rehef nor as a depression, but resembles a lalce brighter than the

neighbouring plain.

   1867, July 9. Mr. Huoorys measured the length and breadth of the white

spot, \\z. 7"'S54 length, and 6""138 breadth. On the same evening I measured

the white spot in the direction of position angle 0°, and found the diameter

in  this  direction  7'''004                          the  mean  of the length  and  breadth  gives 6"'996

for an intermediate diameter.

hy terminator at the moon's equator 0° 6'-4, Linne being unenlightened.

Later, when the moon was low in the west, Mr. Buckingham saw an oval spot

rise gradually out of the dark part of the moon, which projected a shadow to

the edge.

   From the sketch accompanying the note, it would appear that this spot
was somewhat elevated above the general surface, as the shadow extended to
the terminator, also the cone of the little crater is shown casting an exterior
shadow, the orifice being a black spot. On the same evening, at 8'' 30", Mr.

Bird noticed two notches on the terminator near the neighbourhood of Linne,

   1867, Oct. 5. Mr. Slack, of Camden Square (telescope 6|-inch aperture,

silvered glass reflector), observed the white spot. He says, " The next

night (Oct. 5) I thought the white patch round Linne smaller than on many

former occasions, but changes of this sort are very common."

   Mr. Webstee, of Dundee (telescope 7-inch aperture, achromatic object
glass by Cooke), records, " Oct. 5, I could see Linne only as a small faint

nebulosity."

--It showed as a distinct clear white spot, round which the sea was distinctly

of a deeper tint one of the nondescript ochrcous browns. 'No symptoms of

a cloudy edge was visible vrith my 6| and power lOU."

    In contrast with this and as illustrative of Mr. Slack's opinion of varia-
tions in the appearance of Linne (see 2')ost, p. 22) I quote the following passage

from my note-book under date 1SG7, July 8 :

    " The portion near the south border of the Mare Serenitatis was greatly in
contrast with Linne and its neighbourhood. While the most minute furrow
or cleft could have been seen near Sulpicius Gallus, linne was so indistinct that
nothing Avas visible except the spot of light, and this was quite undefined, so
that any Avell-marked margin, was invisible. Linne appeared as a light spot,

hriqliter towards the centre."

   On Oct. 17, to lo*", G. M. T., Mr. F. Bird, of Eirmingham, observed the

white spot but could not see the small crater, nor any trace whatever of sha-
dow, but he noticed that the place occupied by the small crater in July was
in October umisualhj bright. It is to be remarked that the state of the air
was almost as bad as possible at the time, so that it is doubtful if the small
crater was really replaced by the small bright spot.

   1867, Oct. 18, le"" to 20'' 30". Mi-. BrcKiNonAM observed the white spot

to be convex.
   Mr. Crossley on the same day saw the white spot as an irregular badly-

defined patch, especially towards Bessel, on which side near the centre was
the only shadow visible, which might have been the shadow of the supposed

central peak from its position.

                              Analogous Spots.

      Estimations and measures of the White Spot.

    Table I. contains estimations and measures of the extent of the white spot
in seconds of arc, English feet, and French metres. Those marked (*) are
measures, all at an angle of position=0°, except the measures by Mr. Huggins
marked respectively (t) the length, and {%) the breadth of the white spot.
The angles of position of these measures arc not given. As the same angle
of jiosition gives a different line of measurement on the moon's smrface from
day to day, the measures are not referable to the same line across the

white spot.

   The number of English feet subtending an angle of l"-0 at the centre of
the moon's disk at mean distance is 6116-7. At any given distance from the

centre this quantity is increased in the proportion of the secant of the angle.

tance and libration. The former presents them alternately to the eye under

larger and smaller angles, according as the moon is nearer to or further from

us. The latter alters their positions on the disk, sometimes bringing them

nearer to the apparent centre, at others removing them to a greater distance

from it. Approximately, distance may aficct the measurements of objects to

an extent of about a 9th part of the greatest measures at the epoch of mean
libration ; for as mean libration may occur when the moon is in perigee,

a measure taken at the time of apogee, when the moon is in a state of mean

hbration, will be less by about the 9th part of a measure taken at perigee
mean libration.

Libration atfects the measures of objects by presenting them imder larger

or smaller angles, according as they are nearer to or further from the centre

of the apparent disk ; thus an object of 6116-7 English feet in diameter,

occupying the centre of the disk nt mean distance, would subtend an angle
of l"-0. At mean Libration, moon in Perigee, an object of the same ex-

+tent would subtend an angle of l"-059 ; moon in Apogee 0"-941. In the

first case a similar object at an angular distance of 19° 54' 40" would appear

foreshortened in a radial direction, the longer axis at right angles to a radius

measuring l"-059, the shorter axis 0"-996 ; the shorter axis of an object of

the same diameter at a chstance of 29° 54' 40" on the same radius would

measure only 0"-918                                                                                           the difference, 0"-07S, is the change of angle arising

                              Brightness of the Whitish Spot.

    Since Schmidt suspected a change in Limie he has recorded nine compari-

sons of the brightness of Linne with that of the spot on the S.E. of Posi-

douius marked y by B. & M. (see ante, p. G). On seven occasions he found it

less bright than y, viz. on 1866, ^ox. 17, 19, 22, 23, and 2-1; and 1867,

Jan. 13 and 14 §. On Dec. 16, 1866, he recorded it equal to y ; and on Dec.

14, 1866, brighter than y. I also found it less bright than y on seven even-

ings, viz. 1866, Dec. 19, 1867, Jan. 14 §, 15, Feb. 11, May 11 and 15, and
Aug. 12. On May 17 and July 13 I recorded it as equal to y, and brighter than

y on March 14 and Aug. 10 ; on March 14 Mr. Buckingham estimated it as
equal to y. The above are comparisons -with y only, they give no informa-
tion as to the degree of brightness -n-ith which Linne reflected the sun's light.

The following are my estimations of the brightness of Linne, the scale being

=shadow =0"^, the bright mountain in Aristarchus 10°.

   These numbers appear to indicate that between 1866, Dec. 14, and 1867,
Aug. 12, Linne increased in brightness as the altitude of the sun increased.

   The following are estimations of the brightness of y Posidonius contempo-

raneous with those of Linne.

especially of the highest part, a little south of Linne. I E^ ^ [y Posidoiiius],
when near the morning or evening tenuinator, shows itself as a distinct
mountain peak of 150 toises, or 959-2 English feet in height. It is only
when the sun attains a considerable altitude on y that it presents the same
appearance as Linne, viz. that of a white diffused cloudy patch. So far as I

am aware, it is only recently that this similarity of appearance between these
objects has been observed. Although many monntains and craters lose their
distinguishing featnres, and appear as round white spots when the sun is at

a great altitude above their respective horizons, there are numerous craters

that present the characteristic appearance of having a darJc interior, sur-

rounded by a hriglit ring under the more direct rays of the sun, when most

mountains are seen as bright spots.

    Connected with the similarity of appearance under high illumination is

another interesting feature characterizing Linne and y Posidonius [I E* '^],
\"iz. the existence during the period of observation, of crater-openings on

both. Of that on Linne I E')' ^ we have numerous records. That on y [I E^ ^]
is certainly smaller than I E^ ", and has been seen only on five occasions.
It was discovered 1867, Januaiy 14, by Mr. Knott, with his T^-inch 0. G.
by Alvan Clark. His own words wiU best describe the nature of the disco-
very. "Writing under date of March 3, 1867, he says, " While observing
Linne' on the 14th of Januaiy, at about lO** 30" G. M. T., I had myself a
strong impression of a darl: sj^oi, as described by Schmidt, but definition was

so poor, and I saw, or fancied I saw, traces of a simiiar appearance on Posi-
donius y, that I regarded it as an illusion, and made no note of it at the

time. I could not, however, free my mind from the idea that there mir/lit be

something in it, and accordingly, two days afterwards, I added the following
note, which I transcribe verhatim :

    " I had a verg strong impression, with various eyepieces, of a small cen-

tral dark spot on the diffused patch covering (?) Linne, so strong that I
inclined to regard it as having a real existence ; as, however, I saw a similar

appearance, though not nearly so strongly marked, on y [Posidonius], I can

--onlj" regard it as a curious optical illusion." Xote added Januaiy 16, 1867.

   Tliis dark spot on y Posidonius was next seen by Mr. Buckingham on the

11th of April, 1867. His observation is thus recorded :--

   " 1867, April 11, 6"^ to 10'> 59TM. Air very steady, but slightly hazy, and
found y Posidonius a fine crater, 0"-5, seen well with 360 and higher,
clearly with 250, but could not with 120."

 --1867, May 11. Herr ScinriDT recorded as follows : " I also see a deli-

cate black point in y Posidonius ".
   1867, Oct. 16. Mr. BucKiNGnAM saw and described it as very black.
   1867, Dec. 4, 7"^ 30TM, G. M. T. Mr. Knott records that it was well seen*.
   The increase of the brightness of Linne as the sun attains a greater alti-

tude above its horizon, especially as y Posidonius does not exhibit it in so

marked a degree, may bear a passing remark without at all hazarding an

   * About the middle of January 1866, Mr. Leigh, then of Birkenhead, novr of War-
rington, detected a curious group of three small craters and three smaU moimtains north
of Aristoteles, which is figured by Webb in the ' Intellectual Observer,' Ko. 60. vol. x.
Jan. 1867, p. 441. April 11, 1867, Webb detected on the western of the three mountains

Maya shallow pit (I I' ") (see ' Intellectual Observer,' l^o. 64. vol. si.  1867, p. 282).  Webb

h.id pri->viniisly (1806, April 21) detected a cavity or pit (T I**) on tlie western mountain

of B. & M.'s r nortli of Ari.stoteles, which was extremely plain 0]i April 11, 1867. In

connexion with the phenomena presented by Linne, the value of observations of these and

opinion as to change. Varying angles of ilhimination appear to affect objects

on the moon's surface differenthj ; for example, under an oblique illumination,

when the sun shines more directly on the steep sloping sides of some craters,

they appear very bright ; this brightness arises from two circumstances, viz.
the nature of the surface of the sloping sides, and the angle of illumination

upon them being more direct ; this of itself -will make a difference in the
brightness (when no real difference exists in the reflective power of the in-

terior and exterior surfaces) at the times of sun-rising and setting ; as the

sun rises higher above the horizon the brilliancy from this cause declines.
The variations in the brilliancy of Linnc, y Posidonius, and other spots which
arc similarly affected, do not appear to be produced in the same manner.
The difference arising from elevation in the case of Linnd (if it exists) seems
to be too slight to occasion any appreciable effect. The gradual brightening

of such spots as Linne, especially when situated on a ground which darkem

--ujider the more direct rays of the sun, appears to point to something in the

nature of the surface of the spot as contrasted with that of the surrounding

--surface on which the sun's rays exert an influence, rendering it, for the time

being, capable of reflecting a greater amount of light. While there is a more
or less constant relation between reflective power and angle of illumination,
the recorded differences of reflective power under the same angles of illumina-
tion, would indicate that these differences depend upon other circumstances
than increase and decrease of illuminating angle. The phenomena presented
by Linnc during the last twelve months are strikingly in contrast with those

presented by Plato, as observed by me between 1859 and 1863. Linne is

faint under "oblique rays, bright under those that are more direct. Plato re-
flects more light under oblique, and less under more direct rays, i. e. the sur-

face is of a darler tint under a higher angle of illumination.

   This object, of which no measures exist, has not been previously recorded,

&unless SchriJter's description of the spot v refers to it (see ante, pp. 3 4).

His language is, however, rather ambiguous, and it is doubtful as to whether
he describes a plain on the same level as the adjacent surface of the Mare
Serenitatis, or one bounded by a low wall which did not rise above the sur-

rounding level. It appears that he did not determine the precise natiire of
the spot V. Schrciter's description is quite irreconcileable with the appearance

--of Linne as given by Lohrmann and by Beer and Miidler.

recorded as foUows, January 12, 6"^ 40'» to 7" 15"', G. M. T. :--

" I saw clearly the ' Ghost' of the ring of Linne. * * * It is broader (and

brighter?) on the western side. The shading in the interior is of about equal

intensity with that of the surrounding Mare. I do not see any real interior or

exterior shadow, though the shadows in neighbouring craters, even those of

very small dimensions, are very distinct. The ring or wall of the crater has

a slightly nebulous appearance, and is in brightness barely equal to that of

the knoll on the Mare east of Posidonius, marked y on B. etM.'s large map.

HeTvith his silvered glass reflector of 12 inches apertiu-e.  says " the air was

very tremulous (the temperature had fallen to 22°) ; but still definition was
fairly sharp with powers of 250 and 300. At first the appearance was cer-

tainly that of a wliitish cloud obscui-ing the crater ; but upon long gazing

and using averted vision, I could plainly make out a centre or nucleus, and

--presently afterwards a marginal ring of perhaps twice the diameter of the

original Linne." Astronomical Register, No. 50, Feb. 1867, p. 33.

4. Feb. 14. Mr. Geoveb, with a 2-foot Gregorian Reflector, 4-in. aper-

ture, powers 50 to 75, saw the ring of Linne faint, plainest on the preceding-

side, very obscure on the following. His observation is thus recorded :

" I saw the ring of Linne with certainty, though but faint ; it was much

the plainest on the preceding side, and I was tolerably certain of an interior

shadow ; bo this as it may, the interior floor was certainly seen, and very

dusky, * * the following side of the object is very obscure."

  5. April 11. Rev. T. W. Webb saw the ring faintly. He says, " With

close attention I once or twice thought I saw the ' Ghost,' described by Mr.

Knott as a pale ring, about as large perhaps as that figured by B. and M., a

--little brighter than the included or exterior surface." Intellectual Observer,

crater complete. The following is an extract from his notc-book :

"For the first time I see Linne unmistakeablj' as a crater, with an im-

doubted dein-essiou in the interior of the ring. The bottom of the crater is

very light, in fact practically identical in tint with the surrounding Mare
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

but Linnaeus is a rinrj surely enough * * * It has a good deal of the effect

of the annular nebula (57 M) in Lyra. The S.W. part of the ring is the

thickest portion of it. I first detected these appearances with a power of

154, and subsequently used one of 255 ; but this only rendered them more

indubitable. Nothing resembling the dark spot seen by Mr. Huggins on the

11th of last May (Monthly Notices, vol. xxvii. p. 296) could be detected."

10. Nov. 3, 5"^ 30". Mr. C. L. Prince, of Uckfield, saw the large sliallow

crater of Linne ivell defined, and the smaller crater as a black point. The

observation is thus recorded :

   " Nov. 3. Upou looking at the moon this evening I saw Linne as a well-

defined crater, with little of that cloudy haziness which has lately supervened
it ; also by glimpses I saw a dark line (as if a shadow) on the side nest the

sun, and \vithin the crater. Saw also the smaller crater as a black point."
   Mr. Prince adds, " On the following evening the cloudy spot had completely

obscured the crater again. I could not detect any crater"*.
    11. 1867, Dec. 3, 5"^ 0TM. Messrs. Joynson and Williams, of Livei-pool,

--saw the shallow crater. The record of the observation is as follows : " The

' shallow ' oval crater was quite distinct, and south preceding there appeared
to be the commencement of another (see ante, p. 7, Aiig. 6, S""). The thin
black line of shadow was well defined ; but the impression given was that
the hill is either very low and rounded, or, if not low, that the sides are of a
very gradual ascent. The ' small ' crater could not be seen."

                                      The Small Cratee.

    There is no record whatever of this object as a crater until 1867, Feb. 11.

As a wliite lull or hJacJc jioint it appears to have been noticed about two months
earher, From the time when Herr Schmidt suspected that a change had
taken place in Linne until December 13, 1866, nothing was seen but the
large white spot. On this day Schmidt discovered a delicate shadow-project-
ing hUl. The next evening, December 14, Mr. Buckingham saw a shadow,

or very black point. Dec. 26, and 1867, Jan. 2.5, Schmidt again saw these
objects ; and on Feb. 11, 1867, Secchi found a small crater. During March,
April, May, June, and JiUy, this small crater was seen by several observers, and

estimates of its diameter given. On Julj- 9 its diameter was measured by Mr.
Huggins. The following are the most important observations of this object :^

    Translation. Dec. 13, evening. Air at times very good. The morning
terminator had just passed over Linne. At first there was not the smallest

object to be discovered in its place, although the delicate ridges about, of
from 1 0-30 toiscs in height (between 60 and 200 English feet), were clearly

visible, as well as the small craters in the N.W. By applying a power of

300, 1 remarked in the place of Linne, which did not show itself distinctly
through the brighter light, an extremely dehcate shadow-projecting hill, for
which a careful estimation gave a diameter of 300 toises (about 1918 English
feet), and a height of 5-6 toises (between 30 and 40 English feet). Towards
 6 o'clock, the sun's altitude for the horizon of Linne amounted to l°-5.
Neither interior nor exterior shadow was visible ; the whole crater-mountain
was entirely wanting, and I saw only a smooth grey plain.

stiU atmosphere, so that I could use the most powerful ej'epieces. The ter-

minator was in contact with the western edge of the Mare Serenitatis. As y
Posidonius, being near fhe terminator, threw a shadow, it could no longer be

compared with Linne. In the Marc I coimted more than 100 craters,

several N.W. of Linne, seven of them almost in a row, which Schroter had

already noticed with the 27-feet reflector. But even now Linne was an ordi-

nary spot of light, but little conspicuous. From 14'' 30"" to 16** 0"* I saw in it

witia a power of 500-600 an extremely delicate black point, which I estimated

toises (1695 English feet). It was either the shadow of a very smaU hUl,
or the remainder of the crater, 5700 toises (36,449 English feet) wide. The
height of the sun at this region was 15° 9'.

   * As illustrative of Herr Schmidt's estimations ofheights the reader is referred to B. and

--M.'s method, as described in ' Der Mond,' § 65, p. 98, a translation of which, by W. T. Lynn,

Esq., is as ibllows: "To measure and calcidate the heights of all' the mountains in the
moon which, luider favourable circumstances, throw peroeijtible shadows, would not only

be inconceiyably tedious and troublesome, but, besides this, tlie desired degree of ac-
curacy would still, in the majority of cases, not be attained, because the shadows are too
short. But when an observer has acquired sufficient practice by repeated measurements
under different angles of illumination, he may use one measured mountain (selecting

one as high as possible) as a standard of estimation for others lying in its neighbour-

hood, especially when they are nearly the same distance from the terminator. Pos-
sessed of some practice in eye-estimations, he will easjly be able to find how many times
the length of a small shadow is contained in the greater one formed by the princiisal
mountain. Thus it was estimated on the 17th of March, 1834, that the shadow of tlie
N.W. wall of Egede was equal to J^ of the shadow of the wall of Eudoxus, the height
of which latter was determined by calculation to be 1627 toises. Egede is situated in the
neighbourhood of Eudoxus, and its distance from the terminator was then -J that of Eu-
doxus, so that approximately the height of its N.W. wall was^xAxl627=54toises above
the interior surface. In this, or a similar manner, have many of tlie elevations given in

the topographical description been determined ; those actually calculated according to the

above formula; are set down in § 07 following."
   Herr Schmidt, speaking of this method in a letter to Mr. Lynn, says, " Such estima-

tions are very accurate, and between hills of the height of 50-200 toises which have been

measured, differencesof elevation of 5 or 6 toises can, when close to the terminator, be sa-
tisfactorily and certainly estimated."

afterwards the sun's height at Linne was at the most 3^. There appeared
no trace of a crater, no shadow, either witliin or without the inconsiderable

faint spot of light, of which the now much diminished diameter might mea-

sure only about 2000 toises (12,789 Eng. feet). The very small black point
visible in it yesterday was wanting to-day. It was therefore not the shadow
of a hill, which would have appeared much greater to-day.

  --Translation. Of this kind are all the more recent observations at this

place.^ If other persons now still assert that they see a crater in the place of
Linue, this only proves to me that they have quite missed its place ; or, in

case they do see a venj delicate crater in the place of Linue, this circum-

stance can only confirm the fact brought forward by me. Linue was for-
merly a considerable crater, the third in magnitude in the Mare, next after
Bessel and Gallus.

into the light, and at 7 o'clock a very small crater was distinctly seen, sur-

rounded by a brilliant white aureole, which glittered against the dark ground

of the Mare Serenitatis. The size of the orifice of the crater was at most -i

of a second, and the am-eole was a Little larger than Sulpicius Gallus.  '*

1867, March 14. Mr. Buckingham measured the " cloudy bright patch,"

and found it to be 6" in diameter. He saw into the small crater, which he

estimated to be equal to the largest on and near to the centre of Plato. He

saw a slight shadow within the crater on the west side.

   1867, March 15. Mr. Dawes, with power 160 on his 8-inch Cooke, saw
"an excessively minute black dot in the middle of Linne."

1867, March 15. Mr. Buckingham again saw the small crater without the

shadow seen on March 14.

   April 12. Mr. Carpenter, with the Great Equatoreal at the Royal Obser-
vatory, Greenwich, saw a crater which he has drawn as on the site of Linne,
surrounded by the aureole as described by Secchi.

   In the suitable and favoiu-able evenings of April and May 1867, Pro-

fessors d'Arrest and 8chjellerup saw the crater opening in the middle of
the large bright and somewhat diffused spot, and estin^ated the diameter of
the circular shadow at not more than 0"-9, at the most 1"-1. Prof. 8chjel-
lerup adds, '·' I wiU just remark that the crater-opening is not nearly so stri-
king as might be supposed from Mr. Huggins's drawing in the June Number

which Mr. Browning regarded as a hill,

brighter than the adjacent surface of the M. Serenitatis. I recorded its brightness as 3°"1,

   * On Jan. 25, Herr Schmidt recorded a delicate black jioint, and east of, and close \o
it, a fine white summit. The diameters of these he respectively estimated at 2C0 and

300 toises ; he did not give the height of the summit. Linne at the time being under tlio
evening illumination, the positions of these objects were such as a small crater would
present, the enlightened exterior rim being east of the dark spot. If the objects were the
interior and rim of the crater seen afterwards by Secclii, and recorded as a remarkable

hill by Schmidt on May 10. Schmidt's estimates on Jan. 2b and May 10 agree as to the
diameter of the crater. This diameter, up to May 10, appears, from Schmidt^s and

Secohi's estimates, to have been under 0"'6.

equal to that of the crater Sulpicius Gallus, with the trace of a small crater

such as we now observe, and not as some have affirmed under the form of a

large black spot. It is certain that the dimensions of the crater are almost
equal to those assigned to it by Schmidt himself, that is to say, about four
miles in diameter.

the adjacent portion of sea, and last night (sec observation, ante, pp. 7, 8)

this peculiar to Linne? I think not, but it must be considered in relation to
other changes of tint and hue."

" La grandeur de I'oriflce du cratere etait de | de seconde au plus, et I'aiu-e'ole

qu'ils assignent a Linne, pour une tache blanche comme ceUe qui existe a

encore plus petit que ces autres crateres qu'on indique seulement jjar des

   Translation. The size of the orifice of the crater was at most -l of a second,

and the aureole was a little larger than Sulpicius Gallus. I insist on this

comparison because it shows that B. & M. could never have figured a crater

as big and as well marked as that which they assigned to Linne, foi.' the

white spot which at present exists ; in fact Sulpicius Gallus is actually much

larger than the little crater which foi-ms the centre of the spot. This last is

even smaller than those craters which are indicated merely by letters with-

out names, and which are distributed at great distances in 31. Serenitatis. It

cannot be doubted that a change has taken place, and it seems probable that

an eruption has filled the ancient crater with a material white enough to look

bright against the dark ground of the sea.

    Translation. If it be true, as described by Lohrmann, that this was a deep
crater sculptured in the plain and represented by the aspect of a pit, round
as a pot, it is incontestable that this crater is effaced and that there remains

nothing of it but a white surface.

 Third Report of the Committee far Exploring Kent's Cavern, Devon-
    shire. The Committee consisting of Sir Charles Lyell, Bart.,

   Professor Phillips, Sir John LubhocKj Bart., Mr. John Evans,
   Mr. Edavard Vivian, Mr. George Busk^ and Mr. William Pen-
    GELLY (Reporter).

The Eeports presented by the Committee, in 186.5 and 1866, render it

unnecessary to give a detailed description of either the situation or the cha-

racter of Kent's Hole. The Cavern may be briefly stated to consist of two

--parallel series of chambers and galleries an eastern and a western ; and to
--have two external openings or entrances a northern and a southern. The

entrances occur in one and the same low vertical clifl^, on the eastern side of
the hill in which the Cavern is situated. They are nearly on the same level,
about 50 feet apart, from 180 to 190 feet above the level of mean tide, and
about 70 feet above the bottom of the vallej' immediately adjacent.

   The Committee have found it convenient to assign names to the various
branches of the Cavern ; and in order to avoid the risk of confusion, they
have retained those which had been previously bestowed by the Eev. J.
M'Enery and others.

   The northern entrance opens, through a short narrow passage, into a
ON KENT^S CAVERNj DEVONSHIRE.  25

-- --somewhat spacious chamber the most northerly of the eastern series, which

Mr. M'Enerjr termed the " Yestibule," or " Sloping Chamber." It measures
about 64 feet from north to south, and 28 from east to west.

    From the north-western angle of the Vestibule, a gallerj-, about 32 feet

long, and var3-ing from 6 to 1-1 feet broad, extends in a north-easterly chrec-

tion, and is known as the " North-cast Gallery.''
    About 22 feet south of the entrance of this Gallery, an opening in the

western waU of the Vestibule, about 35 feet wide, leads into the western

series of galleries and chambers. So far as is known, this is the only passage
connecting the two series.

   A passage, about 22 feet in length and varying from 19 to 27 feet in

breadth, which Mr. M'Enery termed the " Passage of Urns," leads out of the
Vestibule south-\\'ards into the most spacious chamber of the eastern series,
which, therefore, has been termed the " Great Chamber." It measures about
62 feet from east to west, and, where longest, 53 from north to south. In

its eastern side is the second or southern entrance of the Cavern ; and from

-- --its back or western wall almost immediately opposite the entrance there

extends a ad de sac in a westerly direction, for about 29 feet, and varying in
breadth from 15 to 10 feet. This is known as the '· Gallery."

    The Great Chamber opens southwards into an apartment measuring about
40 feet from north to south and 26 from east to west. From the fact that,
during the last twenty years, Mr. Vivian has frequently lectured in the Cavern,
and has on these occasions always taken his stand here, this apartment has

--received the name of the " Lecture Hall" a designation which it is proposed

to retain.

   About 12 feet north of the junction of the Great Chamber and the Lec-
ture HaU, a gallery opens out of the eastern wall of the former, in a south-

easterly direction. Its width is about 7 feet at the entrance, and its length,
which at present is undetermined, exceeds 30 feet. The entrance of a
similar and parallel gallery occurs near the south-eastern corner of the Lec-
ture HaU. In accordance with the names given them by Mr. M'Enery,
they are respectively termed the " North" and " South Sally Ports."

    The Lecture Hall opens southwards into a gallery about 17 feet wide, and
at least 50 feet long ; but as its further end is blocked up with large accu-
mulations of stalagmite and stalactite, its true dimensions are at present
unknown.

    During the year which has elapsed since their Second Eeport was sent in,
the Committee have continued their laboiu's uninterrupteclly ; the Superin-
tendents have made daily visits to the Cavern ; the methods of excavation
and investigation described in detail in the Fii'st Eeport, and which render it

easy to define accin-ately the position of every object found, have been uni-
formly followed : the daily joinnal has been carefully kept ; and monthly
reports of progress have been regularly forwarded to the Chairman of the
Committee.

   From the commencement to the present time, the work has been carried

--on, under the direction and inspection of the Superintendents, by the same

two workmen Charles Keeping and George Smcardon--and the Committee

have great pleasure in stating that nothing can surpass their zeal, industry,
intelligence, and integrity.

   The investigation naturally excites much interest amongst the visitors and
residents at Torquay, and di-aws a considerable number of them to the
Cavern. But, whilst every reasonaljle facility is afforded them for witnessing

the operations, no one is admitted to those parts which are under examina-
                                                                                                                                                           :

--26 REPORT 1867.

tion unless accompanied by one of the Superintendents, The other branches,
and these only, are shown to visitors by the guide appointed by the proprie-
tor, Sir L. Palk, Bart., M.P. Such visits, however, can be made only when
the Committee's workmen are present, by whom, and not by the guide, the
keys are kept. In short, every care is taken to find aU the objects reallj^
belonging to the Cavern ; and every precaution to prevent anything being
maliciously or mischievously placed in the dej)osits for the workmen to find.

    Amongst the visitors during the present year, the Superintendents had

--the pleasure of receiving Captain Galton, Mr. Godwin-Austen, Mr. Gwyn

Jeffreys, and Mr. Prestwich all members of the British Association. They
were conducted over the Cavern by the Superintendents, the mode of opera-
tion was fully explained to them, and they inspected a large and character-
istic series of the fossils, as well as of the flint implements and other relics of
human industrial art, which the Cavern has yielded.

    Hitherto the labours of the Committee have been confined to the eastern
series of galleries and chambers. Of these, the Great Chamber, the Gallery,
the Passage of Urns, the Vestibule, and the North-east GaUery have been
completely explored to the depth of 4 feet below the base of the Stalag-
mitic floor ; to which, from the beginning, and as a first exploration, the
excavation has been restricted. In the Lecture Hall, in which the workmen

are at jn-esent engaged, considerable progress has been made. On its com-

pletion, it is intended to proceed to the gaUery leading out of it southwards,

and then to the SaUy Ports.
   Mr. M'Enery and the other early explorers carried on some part of their

researches in a small portion of the Vestibule, and in the Lecture Hall. In
the latter their works were probably on a somewhat larger scale. Unfor-
tunately, instead of taking out of the Cavern that portion of the deposits
which they had examined, they simply threw it on one side. The Commit-
tee have found it necessary to remove this disturbed material, and, in
doing this, they have examined it -snth a care almost equal to that they
bestow on the virgin ground. The result has been the discovery of a large
number of fine specimens of teeth and other relics of the ordinary Cave
mammalia, which were either unnoticed or neglected by the early explorers.

Indeed, the largest Mammoth molar whicli the Committee have found

occurred in these old workings. In order to the thorough investigation of

--cavern deposits, they must be removed without the cavern partly to secure

their complete examination by daylight, and also to prevent the commingling

of disturbed and undistm-bed soil. Great as may be the pala3ontological

value of the specimens thus recovered, they can be of no service as evidence
on questions of chronology or contemporaneity, as they are confusedly mixed

up with objects belonging to many and widely-separated eras. Hence the
Committee have carefully kept them apart from the specimens yielded by

the ground which was unquestionably intact.
    Except in one limited locality, to be noticed hereafter, the succession of

deposits in the Cavern has been uniformly the same as that described in the

two previous Eeports, viz.

   First, or uppermost : Huge angular blocks of limestone.

   Second : Black Mould, from 3 inches to upwards of a foot in depth.

   Third : Stalagmitic Tloor, varying in thickness from 3 inches to as many

feet, but usually ranging from about 12 to 18 inches.

   Fourth, or lowest yet found: Eed " Cave -earth," with angular pieces
of limestone, and occasionally rounded stones of kinds not derivable from the

Cavern hill.
                               "

ON Kent's cavebn, Devonshire.  37

   The excepted locality, just mentioned, was a part of the Vestibule, where
a layer of black soil, apparently identical with that found almost everywhere
above the Stalagmitic Eloor, occurred beneath the floor. This layer, termed
the " Black Band," was of irregular outhne, and covered an area of about
100 square feet. It contained numerous bits of charcoal, and varied in
tliickness from 2 to 6 inches. Tliroughout about half of its area, it
immediately underlay the Stalagmite, but elsewhere it was separated from
the nether suj-face of the floor by a layer of ordinary Eed Cave-earth,
from 3 to G inches in thickness. At its nearest aj^proach, it was 32 feet
from the northern entrance ; but as a great part of the intermediate ground
had been broken up by the early explorers, it is impossible to say whether

or not it formerly extended further in that direction. No trace of such

material beneath the Stalagmite has been encountered by the Committee
elsewhere. The floor immediately overlying the Black Band was loaded
with fallen blocks of limestone, which were heaped one on another, and
cemented by stalagmitic matter into a firm grotesque pile. This mass rose
to the roof of the Cavern, and originally extended from its eastern almost
to its western wall, thereby dividing the Yestibule into two separate cham-
bers. Mr. M'Eneiy states that when he first visited the Cavern, before some

-- --of the impediments were removed, the only passage on the west side was

"accomplished on all fours"*. A few years ago. Sir L. Palk had a more

convenient passage cut through the pile on its eastern side. In the course
of their researches the Committee have had to remove the entire mass.

   The Black Mould overlying the Stalagmitic Floor has, during the last twelve
months, yielded a large number of objects, such as were described in the
lieports of 1865 and 1866, as well as several of which no examples had
been previously found. Marine shells occurred everywhere in this accumula-
tion, but in the Vestibule they were very abundant ; those of the common

oyster sometimes forming considerable heaps. It does not appear that in all

cases they are necessarily to be regarded as evidence of a molluscous diet,

since many of them, chiefly pectens and oysters, were certainly " dead
valves, as serpula; and other smaU shells are attached to their inner surfaces.

    Potsherds also have been numerous ; but though some of them are of con-
siderable size, nothing approaching a perfect vessel has been found. Judging
from the varied forms of ornamentation on, them, the pieces represent a
largo number of utensils. In most cases they are composed of a coarse clay,
having an admixture of small stones.

   Three spindle-whorls have been added to the collection. One of them is
composed of coarse grit, and, unlike all the others which have been met with
in the Cavern, its upper and lower surfaces are curved, and give it an oblate
spheroidal form. Either for ornamentation or some uuguesscd purpose of
utility, a groove has been cut round its greatest circumference. The two
remaining whorls are of slate, and have numerous ornamental lines. In
this connexion may be mentioned an Amber " bead," larger than some of
the whorls, and in form resembling the grit whorl just mentioned.

    Flakes of both black and white flint, but chiefly the former, have occurred
in large numbers. During the last twelve months, not fewer than about 220
were found in this overlying Black Mould. Almost aU of them were met
with in the Vestibule, and it seems not improbable that, at least, some of
the wliite specimens were dug up from the Red Cave-earth, and either lost
or neglected by the earlier explorers.

--23 REPORT 1867.

   Amongst the metal articles, there are a small bronze hook, an almost per-
fect bronze socketed celt, a halfpenny of 1806, and a sixpence of 1846.

   The bone implements include an awl; a portion of some prismatic tool with
rounded edges, and having on its surface a series of equidistant grooves or

notches, such as to suggest that it may be part of a measuring rod ; two bone

--combs, and fragments of two others. The combs belong to the same class as

that descrilxxl in the First Report " having the form of a shoe-Hfter, with
teeth at the broad end." One of them is small, and rudely formed ; the other

is larger, and is highly finished. Two parallel lines traverse its surface, in a

zigzag series, from end to end. At the end opposite that containing the

teeth, there is a hole, as if for suspending it. This interesting object, the
two fragments of combs, the grit spindle-whorl previously mentioned, a cockle
shell, several potsherds, and a bone cut with sone keen-edged tool were found
in the south-eastern portion of the Great Chamber, where the overlying Black

Mould was itself overlaid by a cake of stalagmite, which was attached to the
wall of the cavern, from 1 to 2 inches thick, and which measured 7
feet from north to south by 6 from east to west. In many instances, sta-
lagmite, fuUy as thick, had been found on the large blocks of hmestone lying
on the Black Mould ; but this was the first, and, indeed, is at present the only
example of such a cake formed immediately on the Black deposit itself. The

interest attaching to it lies in the fact that there the lodgement of the Black
Mould had closed before the formation of the stalagmite lying on it had
begun ; and that thus a certain amount of antiquity is secured for the objects
which, as has just been stated, were found sealed up. In short, the geolo-

gical evidence concurs with the archfeologieal.

    The overlying Black Mould has continued to yield a large number of bones
of various mammals and birds, none of them probably belonging to extinct
species. In this series, the most interesting objects found during the last

--year, are several portions of the human skeleton including ve-tebrte, parts

of lower jaws containing teeth, several loose teeth, and a skull. The skuU
was found about 6 inches below the surface, adjacent to the limestone rock,
and immediately -within the northern external entrance of the Cavern. The
other human remains were met with in different parts of the Vestibule, and
on different occasions. The first relic, indeed, the first vestige of the human
skeleton met with dm-ing the present exploration, was part of a lower jaw
containing two molars, and was found in December 1866.

    The Stalagmitic Floor has presented its usual characters ; being sometimes
 crystalline and extremely hard, and at others granular and comjiaratively soft.

Xot unfrequently it is composed of thin lamina^ alternately crystalline and
granular. The Committee have still to report that comparatively few objects

have been found in it. Amongst those which have presented themselves, are
 stones of diff'erent kinds, charcoal, flint flakes and cores, and remains of various
 animals, including the bear, fox, horse, and man. The stones, when not
 fragments of limestone, are commonly well-rounded, and were probably
 selected at the adjacent sea shore. One of the artificially formed flints has

 the appearance of being a frag-ment of a polished celt, or axe, and is the only
 specimen of the kind which has been found in the Cavern. Since the Second
 lleport was sent in, a total of ten flakes and chips, of probably artificial

 origin, have been met with in the Stalagmite. The human remains are a
 tooth, and a portion of an upper jaw containing four teeth. They were

 found lying together in the Vestibule, about 30 feet from the northern en-

--trance of the Cavern, and deeply imbedded in the floor, which was 20 inches

 thick. These interesting relics the most ancient remains of man's osseous

--system -nhicli the Cavern has yet yielded were found on the 3rd of Januarv

1867.

   The Black Band below the Stalagmitic Floor was extremely rich in objects,
many of which are of great interest. They include bones and teeth of various
animals, and traces of the presence of man. The list of animals represented
in this Band includes the ox, deer (more than one species), horse, badger,

bear, fox, Uhinoceros tichorlihms and Hycena spelcea.

   The indications of human existence are chips, flakes, cores, and imjilements
of flint ; bone tools ; and bones partially burnt. The flint specimens form a

total of 366 in number, or about ten on the average in every cubic foot of the

material composing the Black Baud. Tliough many of them are mere chips,
and the majority are flakes, no inconsiderable number are more or less per-
fect lanceolate implements. By far the greater number are white, and have
an almost chalky aspect and textm-e. Some of them are so extremely fragile

as to break on the least pressure. It appears utterly impossible to suppose

that they were introduced into the Cavern by other than human agency, or
that they had ever been moved from the spot where they were primarily
lodged. The bone tools are two, perhaps three, in number. One of them is
an awl about 3| inches long, and cut at one end to a sharp point. It was
found on the 27th of November 1866, beneath a floor of Stalagmite 16 inches
thick, and perfectly intact and continuous in aU directions, at a spot aboiit
40 feet from the northern entrance of the Cavern. The second tool is a por-

tion of a so-caUed harpoon, barbed on one side only, and about 3| inches long.
It was found on the 17th of January, 1867. The third is of a nondescript
and doubtful character.

  --With the exception of the Black Band found only in one branch of the
--Cavern, and occupying a veiy hmited space the deposit below the Stalag-
--mitic Floor is everywhere tolerably uniform in character Bed Cave-earth

with angular fragments of limestone. The latter vary from mere splinters to

blocks weighing many tons. Typically, this Cave-earth may be said to be

composed of about equal parts of loam and stones; but in some places the

latter greatly preponderate, whilst in others the former is most prevalent.
EoUed stones, not derivable from the Cavern hill, occur here and there in
every part which has been explored ; but in those branches with which the
Committee have been occupied during the last twelve months, they have not
been so numerous as they were in the Gallery described in the Second Report.
Blocks of stalagmite, the broken remnants of an old floor, continue to be
abundant. They occur at aU levels, both in the Cave-earth, and in the
Stalagmitic Floor which the Committee found intact, and occasionally they

project obliquely through the latter to the height of a foot or more. Many of

them are of considerable size, measuring upwards of a cubic yard. Indeed
one block, in the Lecture Hall, measui-ed fully three cubic yards. So far as
at present appears, no part of the Cavern is exempt from them, with the ex-
ception of that part of the Great Chamber extending from the soutliern en-
trance to 40 feet within it. From their first appearance, it was obvious
that they were either of stalagmitic or of stalactitic origin. Their structure
was strongly in favour of the former view, and this has been recently con-
firmed by the discovery of stones and bones incorporated within several of the
blocks found in the Lecture Hall. It was stated in the First Report that matter
of probably faecal origin was frequently met with in the Cave-earth in tlie

AGreat Chamber. large quantity of this material, frequently forming consider-

able heaps, was found in the southern portion of this Chamber, which has
been recently explored. With the exception of a few small pieces in the
--30 REPORT 1867.

Leetui-e Hall, nothing of the kind has presented itself in the other branches

of the Ca-sern which the Committee have yet investigated.

   In the Lecture Hall, as -well as in the immediately adjacent part of the
Great Chamber, a series of subterranean tunnels have occasionally been broken

into by the workmen. They are more or less eylinrbical, sensibly horizontal,

and except in rare cases, upwards of 4 feet below the iipper surface of the
Cave-earth. Their size appears pretty uniform, and is such as would allow

a fox, or perhaps a badger, to turn in them. Mr. M'Enery, who mentions
them, thinks, and with much probability, that they are " Fox-earths."

Fragments of bui-nt bone have been found, here and there, in the Cave-

earth in every chamber and gaUery.

No other branch of the Cavern has proved to be quite so rich in bones as the

Great Chamber, the larger portion of which was explored in 1865, and of

which the particulars were given in the Eeport presented that year. Never-

theless, a very large number of teeth and other remains of the ordinary cave
mammals have been exhumed from the Eed loam during the last twelve

months. It may be doubted, however, whether any important additions have
been made to the list of animals given in the two previous Eeports. As a
provisional statement, the mammals represented by the vast collection which

has now been made, may be still said to be the Cave-bear, Cave-lion, Cave-

hycena. Fox, Horse (probably more than one species). Ox, several species of

Deer, the tichorhine Ehinoceros, Mammoth, and Badger. The condition of the

bones is the same as that of those described in the previous Eeports. Many of

them are of an almost chalk-like whiteness, whilst others are discolored ; some

are more or less coated with films of stalagmite ; many are merely fragments

or splinters ; a considerable number have been gnawed ; those found imme-

diately imder heavy blocks of limestone are crushed; several are split longi-

tudinally in such a manner as to betoken  human  agency                                  they are  all  cha-
                                                                                      ;

racterized by a specific gravity greater than that of the bones found in the
Black Mould overlying the Stalagmitic Floor ; on the tongue being apphed to

them, they all more or less adhere to it ; and in no instance have the elements

of an entire skeleton, or anything approaching it, been found together. It is
still true that, so far as is laiown, no bone or tooth of Machairodus, Hippopo-

tamus, or Man has yet been found in the Cave-earth.

The Eed earth has also yielded a considerable number of chips and flakes

of flint diu-ing the last twelve months. The aggregate from the four foot-
levels amounts to 238 specimens, which were thus distributed : 120 in the

first foot-level, 53 in the second, 36 in the third, and 29 in the fourth or low-

est. There are not amongst them any ovate implements, nor can the series
as a whole, perhaps, be regarded as quite equal in interest to those which were
described in the Eeports of 1865 and 1866. The artificially wrought flints,

inclusive of chips and flakes, which have been found in the Cavern during

the last twelve months, form a total of 834 ; =220 from the overlying Black
Mould, +10 from the Stalagmitic Floor, +366 from the Black Bard, +238

from the Eed Cave-earth.

Though the Committee have not on this occasion the pleasure of laying

before the Association any higlily-wrought flint implements, they have the

gratification of producing tools formed of another material, and of a kind not

previously found in the Cavern. Though it may be difiieult to understand it,

there is reason to believe that a few persons continue to be sceptical respecting

the artificial character of even the best unpolished flint implements found in

the Cavern or elsewhere. The Committee venture to entertain the opinion

that the evidence which the last twelve months have put into their possession
                                              ON Kent's cavern, Devonshire.                                                                                                  31

renders it impossible for any one to doubt that Man occupied Devonsliire

when it was also the home of the extinct Hon, hyaena, bear, rhinoceros, mam-

moth, and their contemporaries.

 --Of the tools alluded to, two have already been mentioned the bone awl and

the " harpoon " found in the Black Band, beneath the Stalagmitic Floor, in

the Vestibule. As has been stated, in this same thin band there occurred,

with the implements just mentioned, teeth of rhinoceros, hyaena, and other

of  the common cave mammals                                                                                                     and the story they tell  is at  once  clear  and
                                                                                                                             ;

resistless. These, however, are neither the only," nor the best bone imple-

ments which have been exhumed. Two others have -been met with, and both

of them in the Red Cave-earth, below the Black Band. One is a portion of a

highly finished " harpoon," 2^ inches in length, and dififering from that pre-

viously mentioned, in the form of its point, and in being barbed on two sides.

To use a botanical term, the barbs are " opposite," not " alternate," as is the
case with many of the doubly-barbed implements of the kind found in cer-

tain French caverns. It is worthy of remark that whilst in France the same

cavern has rarely, if ever, yielded both singly- and doubly-barbed " harpoons,"

an example of each kind has been found in Kent's Hole. This implement

was met with on March 18th, 1867, in the Vestibule, in the second foot-level

of Bed Cave-earth. Vertically above these 2 feet of loam, there lay the Black

Baud about 3 inches thick, and containing flint flakes and remains of extinct

Mammals                                       over this again came the Stalagmitic Floor, IS inches thick, gra-
                                           ;

nular towards its base, crystalline and laminated towards the upper surface,

continuous in all directions, unquestionably intact, and without fracture or

crevice of any kind ; and supei-posed on this, was the ordinary Black Mould

with Romano-British potsherds. Like all bones found in the Cave-earth,

the '^ harpoon," when applied to the tongue, firmly adheres to it. It has the

condition which, from the spot it occupies, might have been looked for.

   The second bone tool from the Cave-earth is a well-finished pin, 3\
inches in length. It was found on the 3rd of January, 1807, and, like

all the other bone tools, in the Vestibule. It was met with in the fourth

--foot-level below the Stalagmite the greatest depth to which the ercavation
--has been carried, and in immediate contact with the crown of a molar of

Ehinoceros tichorhinus. Vertically over this specimen there lay, in ascending

order, 4 feet of Cave-earth ; then the Black Band ; over this the Stalga-

mitic Floor, 20 inches thick, perfectly intact, and continuous in all directions
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

this was surmounted by the Black Mould ; and the whole was crowned 'R'ith

large blocks of Limestone, cemented with carbonate of lime into a firm breccia,

which reached the roof of the Cavern. The pin is well made, almost per-

fectly round, tapers uniformly from the head to the point, and has a consi-

derable polish. It is, perhaps, more than probable that it was an article of

the toilet, and hence the polish it bears, instead of having been designed, may

have been the result of the constant use to which it was put. It may pro-

bably be said of its original possessor, as it has been of a more modern savage,

                                              " The shaggy wolfish skin he wore,
                                                rinnecl by a polished bone before."

 _ Though the Committee abstain from drawing any inference from the fact,

since it applies to a limited number of objects only, it may be worthy of re-
mark that the most highly finished implements, whether of flint or of bone,

are those which have been found at the lowest levels.

been carried on, has been marked by some prominent facts. Thus, ovate flint
implements have been found in the Great Chamber only, and there too the
ffecal matter was almost exclusively met with. Bone tools and the Black
Band presented themselves in the Vestibule, but not elsewhere ; and the same
branch of the Cavern was marked by the great numbers of chips and flakes
of flint, and of blocks of old Stalagmitic Floor. Indeed the latter were so
numerous and so piled on one another, esx^ecially on the western verge of the
area occupied by the Black Baud, as to assume the aspect of a rudely formed
wall. In the Lecture Hall, extremely few specimens of flint occurred ; but
many of the blocks of old Stalagmite contained bones and teeth, the great
majoi'ity of the latter bemg those of the Cave-bear. The blocks themselves
were just as numerous in the other branches, but not one of the77i was found

to be ossiferous.

   Were we to speculate respecting the probable interpretation of the Black

--Band found beneath the Floor of the Vestibule bearing in mind its very

limited area, its position near the northern entrance of the Cavern and within
the influence of the light entering thereby, its numerous bits of charcoal and

--of burnt bones, its bone tools audits very abundant, keen-edged, unworn, and

brittle chips and flakes of whitened flint, we might be tempted to conclude
that we had not only identified Kent's Cavern as the home of one of our earlj'

ancestors, but the Vestibule as the particular apartment in which he enjoyed

the pleasures of his own fireside ; where he cooked and ate his meals ; and

where he chipped flint nodules, and cut and scraped bones into implements
for war, for the chase, and for domestic use.

    It is not improbable that some feeling of disappointment may rest in a few
minds, and possibly something akin to rejoicing may find a place in others, at

the fact that the labour which has been expended on this Cavern from the
time of M'Enery to the present moment, has failed to detect beneath the

Floor of Stalagmite any portion of the human skeleton. The results of these

 labours, however, do not justify either of those feelings, nor do they increase
 our confidence in negative evidence. Mr. M'Enery, at the end of the re-

 searches which, from 1825 to 1829, he carried on, was able to report the dis-
 covery of flint implements as the onlj' indications of human existence. To
 the same eff'ect were the subsequent investigations of Mr. Godwin-Austen
 and, in like manner, the Torquay Natm-al History Society, at the close of their
 search in 1846, were unable to report further than that they had found man's
 flint tools mixed up, in the lied Cave-earth, with the remains of extinct ani-
 mals in such a way as to render it impossible to doubt their contemporaneity.
 In 1865, the Committee appointed by the British Association commenced the
 exploration entrusted to them ; and for some months they too were unable to
 report more than the discovery of flint implements.

     In 1858, moreover, the celebrated cavern at Brixham, on the opposite side
 of Torbay, was discovered and methodically explored. The trustworthiness

 of the facts disclosed there may be said to have at once revolutionized the
 opinion of the scientific world on the question of human antiquity. The facts
 themselves, however, were identical mth those which Kent's Cavern had

--yielded, at intervals, for upwards of thirty years, flint tools inosculating with

 the remains of extinct mammals, in the Cave-earth, below a continuous floor

  of stalagmite. If ever merely negative evidence, then, could establish a pro-

 position, it seemed safe to conclude that the only traces of man contained by

  the ossiferous caves of Devonshire were the so-called flint implements, about

 whose human origin some persons were still sceptical.
     The Kent's Cavern Committee, however, were enabled in their First Re-
       ON Kent's cavern^ Devonshire.                     33

port, in 1865, to add the new fact that several pieces of burnt bone, as well

as a stone having the appearance of a whetstone, and undoiibtedly of distant
derivation, had been met with in the cave-earth. Before the end of another

twelvemonth, their attention had been arrested by a further phenomenon,

and in their Second Report they remarked that " many of the long bones had

been split longitudinally," and that it Avas " difficult to suppose that less than

human agency could have so divided them." In this, their Third Report,

they are able to advance another step, and to record the discovery of bone

tools, about the character of which there can be no difference of opinion,

which have the mineral condition characteristic of bones found in the deposit

they occupied, which occiu'red with the remains of extinct mammals in soil

indubitably intact, one of them at the greatest depth to which the excavation

has been carried, and all of them beneath a thick unbroken Floor of Stalag-

mite, which has itself yielded remains of at least three of the extinct cave-

mammals. These successive discoveries, after labours so protracted, are cal-

culated to warn us not to place implicit confidence in merely negative evi-
dence ; to encourage the hope that the bones of man may yet be exhumed,
though probably in sparing numbers only ; and, should this hope be never

realized, to justify even the most cautious in holding and avowing the belief

that man was, in Devonshire, the contemporary of animals that had become

extinct before the times of history or of tradition.

Again, that Kent's Hole was largely visited in Romano-British times, is

testified by numerous and varied objects of that age, foimd in the Black
Mould overlying the Stalagmite ; and that the curious frequently made

excursions to it during the last century, may be safely inferred from state-

ments in the works of the local historians Polwhele and Maton . But waiving

this point, and going no further back than the last forty years, it is capable

--of proof that, within that time, the Cavern was visited by more than ten

thousand persons including not only scientific inquirers, but large pic-nic,

dancing, and Bacchanalian parties. All the visitors had to be accompanied

by the appointed guide, who was invariably paid for his attendance. The

payments were generally made in the Vestibule ; and it might have been
expected that, from time to time, money would have been lost, at least, in

that part of the Cavern. Jfevertheless, though the Black Mould has been

most carefully examined, and has yielded a very large and most miscellaneous

collection of objects, it was not until the close of twenty-one months that the

labours of the Committee met with a pecuniary reward, in the form of a half-

penny of George the Third. Two months afterwards, they had the happiness

of finding a sixpence of forty years later date. Besides these, no coin has been

met with from the commencement of the work to the present time.
   Further, in their First Report the Committee reminded those who were

disposed to attach importance to the fact that man's bones were not forth-

coming as readily as his implements, that in the Black Mould, as well as in

the Red Loam of the Cavern, the only indications of his existence were rem-

nants of his handiwork ; that pottery, implements varying in kind and in
material, the remnants of his fires, and the relics of his feasts were numerous,

and betokened the lapse of at least two thousand years ; but that there, as

-- --well as in the older deposit the Cave-earth below, they had met with no

vestige of his osseous system. This remained to be their experience, not only

when their Second Report was sent in, but up to December last. Then the
speU was broken by the discoveiy, in the Black Mould, of part of a human

lower jaw containing two molars. This, as has been stated, was followed by

the exhumation, fi'om the same deposit, of parts of other jaws, a skull, and

1867.                                                 D

other portions of the skeleton ; and, as if to emphasize the fact, whilst these

remains were being found, a fragment of a human upper jaw containing four

--teeth was, as previously mentioned, detected deep in the next older formation
     the Stalagmitic Floor.
    Lastly, during the past two years, the blocks of stalagmite previously men-

tioned have been found in every branch of the Cavern, and in all parts of the
deposits. Their structure indicated that they were portions of an old floor,

which, in some way not easy of explanation, had been broken up, and the

fragments incorporated in the detrital accumulations subsequently lodged in

the Cavern, and on which was formed that Stalagmitic Floor which the Com-

mittee found intact, and are breaking iip every day. This view of the origin
of the blocks was confirmed by the fact that a considerable remnant of an
old floor still remains in situ in one branch of the Cavern, and which, under

the name of " The Ceiling," was minutely described in the Report sent in
last year. Nevertheless, as the existing floor very often graduates down-

wards into a breccia, and frequently contains bones, stones, and other
extraneous bodies, it was reasonable to expect that some objects of the kind
would be found attached to, or incorporated in the blocks if they were really
fragments of an old floor which formerly spread over the Cavern. Accord-
ingly, as the blocks presented themselves, all their surfaces were carefully
 examined, but no such trace or indication of their having once covered a
detrital mass was to be seen on any of them. The more thoroughly to sift

--this question, hundreds of them have been broken by the workmen into small

pieces, with the same invariable results a structure indicative of stalagmitic
origin, but without the disclosure of either bone or stone. At length, how-

ever, this large accumulation of negations was utterly set aside. On the
6th of last month (August 1867), one of these blocks, in the second foot-
level of Cave-earth, and in the Lectm-e Hall, was found, on being fractured,

to contain a bone ; and thus any lingering doubt respecting its claims to
represent an old perished Floor disappeared at once and for ever. Rince that
time ossiferous blocks have been fo\uid in the same Hall, at least two or
three times a week.

    The foregoing facts are calculated to stimulate to continued researches,
and to encourage the hope that whilst a spadeful of deposit remains dis-
lodged, a discovery may remain to be made.

The present state of the Manufacture of Iron in Great Britain, and

   its position as compared with that of some other countries. By

   I. LowTHiAN Bell.

                    [A communication ordered to be printed among the Reports.]

The object of such exhibitions as that which now occupies so large a share
of public attention at Paris being to compare the results of human industry,
it is not surprising that we have been favoured with many expressions of

opinion on the relative merits of manufacturing science, as manifested in
individuals as well as in nations.

   These opinions are necessarily founded upon the information conveyed by
the specimens of workmanship exposed for inspection ; and therein, it is to
be feared, is involved more or less of a serious fallacy. No one of any

practical experience has diflliculty in, or attributes the slightest skill to a
manufacturing chemist for, exhibiting any of his usual products in a state of
ON THE PRESENT STATE OF THE MANUFACTURE OP IRON.  35

great purity, provided he pays a little additional care in their preparation,
and is regardless of the expense incurred in this exceptional mode of treat-
ment. In like manner the iron-master, by selecting veiy pure ore and pure

coke, may run from his furnaces an unusually fine specimen of pig iron,
which, being puddled by his best men, hammered and rolled any number of

times, gives, as it cannot fail to do, a sample of iron of great excellence.

   If the question were asked, whether the articles we have the opportunity

of examining upon such occasions convey in every case a correct idea of the
average quality of the goods manufactured by and sold at the current rates
of the exhibitor, it is much to be apprehended that such would not be found

to be the fact.

   The Industrial Exhibition at Paris has afforded an occasion for the iron-
masters, engineers, and practical chemists of the United Kingdom to be told,
on the authority of very influential names, and possessing, we are informed,

very intimate acquaintance with the subject, that while foreign nations have
in recent times been making wonderful advances in manufacturing science,
little progress has been effected in this country. It will probably be beyond
the power of any one individual to speak with a proper degree of confidence,
from personal knowledge, on all the questions embraced in the general charge
against our national industry. This paper will be confined to an attempt to
institute a comparison between our position and that of our neighbours in
the treatment of the ores of iron and their products.

    This subject is selected because it is one to which the most pointed allusion
has been made, and because in it any deficiency on our part would be the least
excusable, seeing that nature has provided us with advantages which ought
to afford the means of our competing with those nations which, by their
superior intelligence and energy, are said to threaten us most.

    If cost of production has to form no element in the calculation, it is clear
results might be obtained which would lead to very erroneous conclusions in
any comparative estimate. It is equally evident that any inherent excellence
in his ores of iron would confer upon the smelter the power of producing a

superior quality of metal, in doing which little, if anything, may be due to

skill in manipulation. These circumstances are referred to merely to remind
you of the difiiculty in pronouncing, with certainty, upon a question where,

in drawing a parallel, so many allowances have to be made. For the present,

however, these disturbing influences will be disregarded, and attention only
directed to the information conveyed by the numerous specimens of the metal

to be seen at the Champs de Mars, and which by many have been assumed

to proclaim our inferiority as manufacturers of iron.

   No one who gives himself the trouble to study this department of the

International Exhibition at Paris, can be otherwise than impressed with the
pains the French makers have taken, not only to afford proofs of the quality
of their produce by ingenious devices in showing fracture and tests of resist-
ance, but also by a great number of sections of iron, which, from thinness
and distribution of material, or great length, or with all these conditions
combined, prove at once the chemical excellence of the metal, and the per-
fection of the machinery used in its mechanical preparation. After giving

the most ample margin to the French, who in their own country would -wish
to do it aU honour, and probably would possess some superior facilities in

securing the necessary space for the display of their manufactures, an
Englishman cannot but feel disappointed at the attempts, as exhibitors,

made by some of our iron-masters, who have aspired to represent their own

nation ; indeed, nothing can excuse the careless indifference of one or two

                                                                           d2

who have intruded slovenly heaps of raw materials, intermingled with pieces
of rusty iron, upon an occasion which may be looked upon as a state cere-

monial of industry.

The practical man, however, notwithstanding these disadvantages, has

there materials and opportunity enough, to enable him to pronounce an

opinion with sufficient precision, on the question of quality of the samples

submitted for examination. I have myself carefully aud repeatedly studied

all the great divisions of this important branch of metallurgical industry at

Paris. I have done so alone, and in company with English and French

engineers, iron-shipbuilders, and iron-masters, both British and foreign,

--including men of the greatest experience and knowledge of the subject, and,,

suj^ported by their concurrent testimony, I imhesitatiugly advance the opinion

that no evidence whatever is to be found there that this coimtry occu:pies a

position less conspicuous for excelleuee of its produce than that of other

nations. Of course, it is not pretended that in such a coinpetition the four

and a half millions of tons of British-made iron have to be brought into com-

parison with those 300,000 or 400,000 tons of the metal which it requires

the collective power of every European nation to smelt from the pui-est and

rarest known ores and charcoal, and which cannot be made or sold at much

imder double the price of our most esteemed brands.

    It is of importance, in an inquiry like the present, to bestow especial atten-

--tion to what may be considered the purely mechanical treatment of iron to

that treatment b)* which it is obtained in the various forms known in com-

merce. Those sections of bars which present mechanical difficulties in rolling,

have those difficulties greatly increased by the presence of certain chemically

Acombined impurities.  good skin, as it is called, and unbroken edges, par-

ticularly in some forms, may be accepted as a fair indication of quality of

iron as well as of excellence of machinery employed. Judged by this standard,

the French as weU as some other nations, have every reason to congratulate

themselves on the state of iron-manufacturing science in their respective

countries, as evinced by some of the really marvellous pieces of iron they

exhibit. One firm, for example, has sent solid rolled bars of double "]" iron

27 inches, and others 33 inches deep, by 30 and 40 feet long, each bar in

both cases weighing forty-six cwts. ; but the greatest chef iVceuvre in this

way is a girder of the same form as the preceding, from the works of

Chatillon and Commentary, 43 inches deep, with flanges 11| inches wide and
web of I5 inch in thickness. This last achievement has not so far met with

any practical application, but it is of value in showing engineers what can
be done, and that when occasion requires it, they have it within their power

to obtain perfectly solid masses of ^vlought iron of these large dimensions

at the same time it may be questioned whether, looking at the lengths which

generally accompany the use of iron of such sectional strength, it will not be
found more economical to construct the girder by rivettiug plates or bars and

angle-iron together. It should be stated that the Butterly Iron Company

have for some time past rolled iron of this description, in a somewhat different

way, for which they charge 40^. a ton less than the French quotations. Plates

of iron, too, are exhibited, roUed so as to require no shearing along the sides,

as has hitherto been practised. In many instances, such, for example, as in

the construction of tanks, bridges, and other articles v.hcre a slight deviation

from perfect soundness on the edge is immaterial, this mode of manufacture

offers advantages by reason of the economy it effects. Against these proofs

of efficiency of miU-machinery and skill in its use, may be placed the armour-

plate, weighing eleven tons and a quarter, from the works of Messrs. Erown
                                                                                                                  ;

ON THE PRESENT STATE OF THE MANUFACTUKE OF IRON.                                                                  37

and Company, of Sheffield, who have rolled plates of this kind «'eighing nearly

twenty-five tons eacli. There arc, it is true, pieces of forged iron in the

Exhibition heavier than even this, bnt the difficulty our manufacturers had

to encounter in transhipment would offer impediments in carriage not expe-

rienced by continental nations in sending objects to Paris, where size alone

formed the test of merit.

   Any one having any recollection of the state of metallurgical science at the

time of the London Exhibition of 1851, will detect, in the means afforded

him at the Champs do Mars, a wonderful change in the manufacture of steel.
This is apparent in the number and dimensions of the objects now produced

in that material. More recently even than sixteen years ago, the use of

steel might almost be said to have been confined to small articles of cutler}'

today, railway wheels, axles, heavy working parts of steam-engines, nnd

even railway bars, absorb immense quantities of this form of iron. The

manufacturers of other nations, in this substance as in iron, maintain their

superiority as exhibitors, and jirobably at the head of all will be placed the

name of Krupp (of Essen), from whose establishment has proceeded, among

other admirable specimens of workmanship, the gigantic mass of cast steel in

the shape of a piece of ordnance, weighing upwards of fifty tons.

  Wc shall presently endeavour to discover to whose energy and inventive

genius tlie credit is most due of having led the way in dealing with iron

and steel of such extraordinary dimensions as are to be met with in our own

days ; and at the same time seek to establish what is the true position of

different nations which have laboiu'cd in raising this remaikabh; branch of

industry to its present colossnl proportions.

In attempting this, the only mode of procedure is by reference to the

history of the past, which shall be done in terms as brief as is consistent with

clearness                                        at  tlie  same  time  it  is  obvious  that  in  a  manufacture  involving
                                              ;

both mechanical and chemical appliances, upon this occasion as well as here-

after, we shall be compelled to exceed those limits which ought to be observed

in any section set apart for discussing a particiilar science. Some indulgence

also must be extended to anj' minor inaccuracies in an endeavour to trace the
progress of an art which owes imjjrovemcnts in its details to different indi-

viduals, whoso position in questions of priority it is sometimes so difficult to

determine.

   It is not so very long ago that the attention of the Government of this
country was called to the fact that the iron furnaces of that day threatened
to place the kingdom in a position of considerable difficulty, from the rapid
manner in which they were consuming the forests of certain districts, and,

indeed, for a time, under the pressure of circumstances which arose, the make

of iron, insignificant as it was, suffered considerable diminution.. From this
state of things the nation was reUeved by the Darbys, in the midland coimties,

succeeding during the last century in applying upon a practical scale Dudley's

discovery of the capabilities of mineral fuel being cmjiloyed as a substitute

for charcoal in the blast furnace. It is quite impossible to overrate the im-

l)ortance of this event in the history of the iron trade, because in localities

where timber is only of little value, the rapid manner in which even a limited
mnke consumes the forests near the smelting establishment, causes charcoal

quickly to rise in price, owing to the increasing cost of carriage. This is easily
perceived when it is remembered that in Styria and Carinthia something like
twenty-five square miles of wood are stated as being required to supply the

wants of each furnace, and that in consequence the best charcoal, owing to

the distance it has to be conveyed, often costs nearly 50s. to GOi". per ton

before it reaches the iron works. Simple as this substitution of pit-coal for

charred wood appears, it was a long time before the difficulties attending its
introduction were overcome, and the jirejudice against its use set aside
Dudley liimself beiiig in his grave long before the accomplishmcut of either.
This cardinal improvement in iron-smolting brings us, witliout fv;rther
change, down to about the beginning of the present century, when our blast-
furnaces were running thirty or forty tons a week, and that portion of their
produce which had to be converted into bar iron was obtained in this con-
dition by means of the old "hearth," a most laborious, costly, and wasteful
mode of treatment. In it charcoal was frequently the fuel stiU employed,
and the small tilt hammer the only means possessed for reducing the malleable

product to the state of the bar.

   This was our position when our countryman Gort effected an entire revolu-
tion in the character of the operations carried on in our forges, hj the inven-
tion of the rolling mill and the puddling furnace. The latter contrivance
was subsequently greatly improved by Rogers abandoning the old sand
bottoms used by its original designer, and by substituting iron plates pro-
tected by iron slag.

    Fostered l)y the discoveries of Dudley and of Cort, the use of iron extended
in every direction, rendering each subsequent im])rovement of increased im-
 portance, by reason of the enlarged field provided for its exercise.

    It was thus a fortunate circumstance that the labours of James Watt, in
 connexion with the steam-engine, placed in the hands of tlie iron manufac-
 turer the means of dri\ing his new machinery, for which the water-wheels of

 our old forges were, in many instances, totally inadequate.

     If the other changes which have been iritroduced in later times into our
 iron processes are to be considered as modifications and improvements only

 of what Dudley and Cort effected many years ago, that of N^eilson in applying
 heated air to the blast furnace has been followed by results of such magni-
 tude as to rank in importance with discoveries of the highest order. The

 effect Neilson's idea has had in reducing the consumption of fuel and the
 expense generally in smelting the ores of iron, is too familiar to all to require

 repetition here.

     It would appear, however, tluit it is only to those greater and more sudden
 changes that the world at large seems to attach any siguiiicance ; for, judging
 by recent criticism on the progress of metallurgical science in this country,
 the fact apparently has been overlooked tliat the iron-masters of Durham and
 North Yorkshire, M'ithin the List four years, have introduced great alterations
 in tlie character of their furnaces, and have succeeded in raising the tempe-
 rature of the blast they employ to a point never contemplated by Neilson
 himself. These progressive changes have enabled their projectors to effect a
 sa\dng in coal and an increase of produce, greater than the difference between

 those cold and hot blast furnaces still in common use in other parts of

  England.

     Our rolling-mill engineers had kept pace with the constantlj' increasing

  rc(]uircmcuts for malleable iron, iintil aliout a dozen years ago, Avhen the

  I'xampJe of the Enqjeror of the French created a demand for an article
  beyond +hc powers "of any rolls then in existence. Possibly they were never
  applied to, owing to the belief then prevailing that hammered slabs of metal
  alone would satisfy the necessary conditions attending the protection of sliips

 --of war, by means of the so-called armour-plating at all events it was by

  means of the steam-hammer (a French idea, it is said, originally, but in-
  debted for its practical introduction here to Nasmyth) that we in this country,
ON THE PRESENT STATE OF THE MANUFACTURE OF IRON.  39

in the year 1855, manufactured the iron for two floating batteries. To Mr.
G. G. Sanderson, of the Park Gate Works, we owe the idea that rolled plates,
by reason of their toughness, would be found superior in resisting shot to
those of hammered iron ; and to him, and to the owners of that establisli-
ment, is due the merit of hanug, in the same year, provided a mill and rolled
the plating for a third floating battery, buUt by Messrs. Palmer on the
Tyne*. The correctness of Mr. Sanderson's views have been justified by
subsequent experiments. Sir William Armstrong's ingenious method of
builchng up wrought iron so as to produce ordnance, having incredible
powers of penetration, has called for greatly increased thickness in armour-
plating. Manufacturers of this description of iron, however, by increasing
the powers of their heating furnaces, miUs, and other appliances, are now able
to supply our naval yards and military establishments with material stiU more
invulnerable 'than that formerly deemed suffieient as a means of defence.

   It is this character of machinery which has enabled mill-owners here and
abroad to handle such huge masses of wrought iron as have excited the

admiration of all who interest themselves in such matters, and it is bj'' means

of the so-called universal mill designed by Mr. Arrowsmith that our friends
in France are rolling their smooth-edged plates.

   This hasty sketch is, it is hoped, an impartial account of what has been

done in this countrj'^ towards advancing the manufacture of iron to its present

position.

   As soon as the occasion arose, other nations profited by the wisdom our
more matured experience had acquired, and every improvement in machinery
or in process, found immediate imitators in each locality where the " forge
Anglaise " had been constructed. It is mere repetition of a truth, admitted
on all sides, that the modern blast-furnaces, forges, and mills abroad are in
principle, and in most details identical with those of this country, and of
such excellent construction as to have placed their owners on a level with
ourselves so far as perfection of machinery is concerned.

    It is, however, not to be expected that those conditions which prevail here
should find an exact counterpart abroad; and wherever a deviation from
things as they exist with ourselves occurred, the foreign iron-master was
found, of course, adopting his mode of procedure so as to suit the change of
circumstances. The chief difference between other countries and this is in
the important matter of fuel. Here, regular lying beds of coal, generally of
great purity, and in very accessible positions, have furnished us with abun-
dant supplies of this clement for the production of iron, and upon terms more

favourable than those within reach of the continental iron-maker, who very
frequently has to work Avith a combustible costly in itself, and containing a
considerable amount of impurity. Long before it was thought of here,

because the same necessity did not exist, our neighboiirs occupied themselves
with devising ingenioiis methods of washing out the dirt contained in their
coal, and afterwards in constructing ovens so as to coke the purified product

with the least possible waste. Thej- also conceived, and now practice on a

very large scale, the idea of securing the advantages of large coal by cemcnt-

ing together in verj- well-contrived machinery the improved small coal thus
placed at their disposal. To meet the increased demand for pitch, which
constitutes the cement used in this last-mentioned process, coke-ovens are

now in use ahroad foi- condensing aU the products of distillation, both of a
tarry as well as those of an ammoniacal nature. In like manner the excess
of heat, which passes away from the puddling and balling fui-nace, instead of
being permitted to escape, was made available in France for raising the steam

for driving the forge and rolling-mill machinery ; but i^erhaps the most ele-
gant and interesting application of a waste product was that effected by em-
ploying the gases, which formerly flamed at the tops of their blast-furnaces,
for a variety of purposes for which hitherto solid fuel had been used.

   Now, it may be asked, were our own iron-masters indifferent spectators to

those valuable ameliorations contributed by other nations to an art in which
Britain might be supposed to occupy the first rank ? The answer is, that no
sooner did a change in the ]nicc of our fuel enable them to adopt, with profit,
the purification of coal andtlic imjjrovements in its conversion into coke, than
both processes were imported into this kingdom ; and at the present day there
is scarcely an ircn-work in it of any consideration, where the machinery is
not driven by the Avaste heat from its OAvn furnaces in the manner suggested
by the example of our neighbours. As regards the use of the blast-furnace
gases, not onlj' h ive our furnace-owners availed themselves of the lesson
tauglit them bj' foreign industry, but the mode of collection has been so im-

jiroved as to afford in many eases results better than those obtained by the
original inventors. At this tim.e not less than 500,000 tons of coal are

annually saved in the Cleveland iron district alone, by the state of perfection
to which this admirable discovery has been carried.

    For many years past such are the advantages possessed by this country for
the economical working of metals that, although the raw material for the
finer kinds of steel had to be imported from other nations, we have been able,
notwithstanding, from our position in other respects, to rank first as manu-
factui'ers of this modified form cf iron. The rapid speeds attained on our

 railways, and the great strain to which the machinery there, as well as on
 other occasions, is exposed, has rendered increased strength of material,
 combined with lightness, an object of the highest importance. Metallurgists
have thus been led to devise some more ready and less expensive methods of
 producing steel, this substance being, as is well known, possessed of the

 desired qualities, unequalled bj' any other known condition of iron. It is

 needless to dwell on the various i)rojects which have been suggested for
 securing this desideratum, inasmuch as every one appears to have been
 driveu out of the field liy that last great discovery of Eessemer, the success
 of which still maintains for this nation its old position in an industry in
 which it has laboured so incessantly and to such good purpose. It is true in
 Prussia there exist gigantic steel-works (those of Krupp and others) where
 the process is carried on by methods confined, it is alleged, to themselves.

Whatever these methods may be, they are not of that character to liave ])re-
veuted the directors of the establishments named from adding the converters

of Bessemer to any appliances or modes of procedure of which they have the
merit of being the original inventors.

    In concluding this endeavour to trace, in its main features, the progress of

the manufacture of iron, I may be permitted to mention that, during a per-

sonal acquaintance with the works of this and other countries, extending
over twenty -five years, I can detect no change in the relative position of our-

selves and continental nations as iron manufacturers. No doubt, abroad, the
ON THE PRESENT STATE O? THE MANUFACTURE OF IRON.  41

production of this metal has increased immensely in late years, but this is duo
to circumstances entirely disconnected with any greater comparative pro-
ficiency than that possessed in former days. During the \yholc of the period

named, the existing iron-works were equal to similar establishments of our

own, and certainly those which have been constructed of late have no pre-

tensions whatever to be otherwise considered.

   The present depressed state of our own iron trade and its recent extension

abroad, have probably countenanced the idea that the distress here has some

connexion with the nature of the progress of the continental manufactures.

It becomes, therefore, not unimportant to ascertain upon wliat grounds such

a supposition is based.

   The first question to which an investigator would address himself in such

an inquiry, is the powers possessed by dififerent localities for obtaining the

raw materials required in the works themselves. Immediately connected

with tliis matter is the right of ownership in the minerals. In foreign

countries gCDcrally, this charge is one of trifling extent, which is far from

being the case Avith ourselves, where, on a ton of pig iron worth about 4-oh.,

the manufacturer will contribute about 4s. for royalty to the owner of the
soil; while on the continent one-fourth of this sum wiU sometimes cover

all that is levied for the right of working the coal and ironstone for the same

quantity of iron. In spite, however, of these disadvantages, and of others

related to the extraction of coal in Britain, the purity of the produce of our

collieries and the favourable conditions under which it occurs, conduce to

place this country, so far as fuel is concerned, in a position rarely approached

by that of any European nation. "When the ores themselves have to be con-

sidered, much greater difficulty meets us than is experienced in the case of
coal. In addition to price we have to look to the percentage of iron they

contain, and also to the widely diff'erent qualities of the metal they yield.

Any verj- lengthened exposition of facts, however, would not only bo tedious,

Webut would lead to some confusion.  must therefore content ourselves

with the statement that the advantages in cost and quality of iron ore pos-
sessed by Scotland, Staffordshire, Wales, and the West of England, are all to

be severally met with on the continent, and from this general statement we

cannot even except the Cleveland ironfield, for a similar dejjosit is extensively

wrought in the Moselle district, and at a price fully below that paid in North

Yorkshire.

Conditions, however, immediately connected with the economy of producing

pig iron, obtain in this kingdom which are seldom met Avith abroad. The ore

which has to be smelted is here either often got from the same strata which

furnish the coal, or the space of country which separates the two is incon-

siderable. The distances, on the other hand, which as a rule intervene

between the coalfields and the iron mines on the continent, are so great as

to prove a source of considerable outlay for conveying the produce of the one

to the other.

With regard to the application of science to those sections of our operation

which are dependent on chemical action, viz. the blast-furnace and the pud-

dling process, the iron-master in other coiintries, as here, can only lament
liov/ little chemistry has hitherto been able to eftect for either. The labours

of Karsten, Schcerer, Bunsen, Tunner, and others, have thrown great light

on the intricate and interesting problems connected with the working of oui*

Weblast-furnaces.  have been informed by means of their investigations,

and those of philosophers in this country and clsoAvhcre, that differences we

know to exist between certain qualities of iron were due to minute quantities
--42 REPORT 1867.

of silicon, phosphorus, or sulphur; but these experimenters have never

taught us how to separate, ccouomically, those almost infinitesimal amounts

of substances, lo rid our produce of which has defied their science and our

practice.

    Both on the continent and in this country, the success attending the use
of the blast- and puddling-furnaces rests, in a great measure, with the work-

men ; and so far as waste of material, quality of produce, or any other test,

enables one to judge of the results, it is as absurd to impute any superiority

to either side, as it is impossible to find a higher degree of science, Avhcre

both British and foreign artisans are equally uninstructed in respect to the

true nature of the process under their control.

   It may be well, at the same time, for our own workpeople to know that,
although we had the start in this particular field of industry, there is not one

department, from rolling the finest wire iron and the thinnest tin plates or
hoops, to turning out the largest rails or heaviest armour plating, in which
these operations are not performed quite as well by foreign labour as by the

most expert rollers in the best mills in this country.

   Reverting now to the relative facilities enjoj'cd on the continent and here
in the manufacture of iron, it may be remembered that ours have been stated
to lie in the possession of mines yielding coal upon more favourable condi-

tions, and in the more convenient geographical distribution of our minerals.

To the last may be added the easier transport of our manufactured produce
to a seaport, due to the insular character of our country. Against this we

have to set the lesser charge for roj^alties on coal and ironstone abroad,
together with the fact, not previously noticed, that their railway trausijovt
is somewhat less costly than with us, reckoned for equal distances. The
saving thus efifcetod in France and other places cannot account for the dis-
appearance which occurs, to a great extent, of the effect of those natural
advantages, economically speaking, placed at the disposal of the iron manu-
facturers of this kingdom.

    So far as a careful examination of iron-works producing above one-half

of the collective make of France, Belgium, and the lluhr district has enabled
Mr. Lancaster, the iron-master of Wigan, and myself to judge, this is dp.(_>
neither to greater science possessed by the iron-master, nor to greater skill
on the part of the workmen, but is wholly to be ascribed to the cheaper rare

at Avliich labour is obtained abroad than with us.
    To ascertain as exactly as possible whether the foreign artisan could, from

surrounding circumstances, dispose of the work of his hands upon cheaper
terms than persons of his own condition are able to do with ourselves, I
made myself acquainted, while in Sweden, France, Belgium, and Prussia,
with the cost of the necessaries of life consumed by the working population.

 It is almost superfluous to say that the creation of additional industry abroad,

and above aU, the ecjualizing effect on prices by the introduction of free trade
here, have entirely changed the aspect of affairs, and that, in consequence,
 provisions are at least 20 to 30 per cent, dearer to the foreign labourer than

they were twenty years ago. Without going into details, it may suffice to

 say that animal food is only 3 per cent, cheajier in the chief seats of con-

--tinental manufacture than with us while house-rent and clothing are aL'out

the same in value with both. On the other hand, at the present moment,
'wheat is fully lower in England, and our own workmen do not pay half the
price charged to persons of their own class abroad for firing employed for

 domestic use.
     Notwithstanding this almost perfect equality in the cost of the necessaries
                                                  ;

ON THE PRESENT STATE OF THE MANUFACTURE OF IRON.  43

of life, labour on the continent is, in very many instances, 30 per cent, below
the price it commands in this kingdom. This estimate is based on calcula-

tions where there is no room for any great diiference in the nature of the
work performed, common brick-making being assumed as one of the standards
of comparison. In the manufacture of iron itself this difference is occasionally
still more remarkable. Colliers, miners, mechanics, iron workers, in short,
every one engaged in the process appear to be receiving 20 to 30 per cent,
below the rates current in this country, and in some cases double, and more
than double, the wages paid abroad are earned in our English iron-works.
The ii-on-masters here have endeavoured to meet what would be an intole-
rable burden in the production of an article made up almost exclusively
of labour, by adopting means for reducing its amount, often considerably
in advance of those met with in foreign establishments. After all this has
been done, however, it leaves us to contend with an extra charge of at least
1.5 to 20 per cent, in the item of wages, which, in the majority of instances,

will be found to annihilate any advantage of position we may otherwise

possess.

   It must be clear that when this country has to compete with foreign

nations in articles invoh-ing a still higher amount of labour, such as steam-
engines and other kinds of machinery, the difference in wages just alluded to
acts still more prejudicially to the advancement of our national industry.

   To the political economist, the question of the future of our iron trade, from
its magnitude, cannot fail to be one of great interest. The extent also to
which steel has lately taken the ])laee of iron in the arts, necessarily confers
upon this material a conspicuous position in any consideration ho or the

metallurgist may bestow on the subject. This becomes more necessary from
the fact that only a very limited number of ores are capable of affording iron

of the necessary quality for the production of steel, by any of the processes

now in existence. It is of importance, therefore, to know that even in

Austria, Sweden, and Germany, where suitable mineral for this purpose does
occur, it is found in quantities quite as limited in extent as prevails with us
in France also, where preparations for manufacturing Bessemer steel on a
very extensive scale arc being made, large quantities of ore are required to
be imported from Algeria and elsewhere to obtain that kind of pig iron which
their own minerals alone arc found incapable of supplying.

   The great strength, however, of our own position as iron manufacturers, it
appejirs to me, must bo sought for in these incomparable fields of coal which
constitute so important a feature in our mineral wealth. I am very sanguine

that the advantages thus secured to us will, notwithstanding present diffi-

culties, maintain the iron trade among the most prominent of our national

branches of commerce. This conclusion is arrived at from a consideration of
the various circumstances connected with the use of coal and the means
possessed by different nations of satisfjang the constantly increasing demands

this use creates. In Great Britain we raise annually something like

100,000,000 tons of this mineral, of which 10,000,000 are exported, and
about 20,000,000 are devoted to the use of our iron-works, leaving thus
70,000,000 of tons for consumption in other descriptions of manufactories,
purposes of locomotion, and for domestic use. In France and Belgium
together, less than one-fourth of our production is obtaiucd, and this only by
gi'eat exertions being made to obtain the largest possible quantity their mines
are capable of affording. After satisfying the requirements of the iron-works

of these two countries, not much over 15,000,000 of tons would remain for
carrying on those operations in which, with a smaller population, we are

consuming 70,000,000 tons of coal. ' 'Now, when we remember the various
purposes to which coal is now applied, and where even a considerable ang-
meutation of price will not preclude its use, wc must at the same time perceive

the serious effect any great change in the value of fuel must exercise on the
production of an iron railway bar requiring five or six tons of coal for its
manufacture. In reality, this disj^roportion between the value of coal and
iron as compared with this country is already perceived abroad, where, not-
M'ithstanding greater mining difficulties than wc have to contend with, fuel
commands a price sufficient to cover this, and also leave a greater margin of
profit than falls to the share of the coal owner in this country.

   Favoured thus, as we undoubtedly are by nature, there seems nothing

wanting for our success in this noble branch of manufacturing science than
a continuance of that unflagging spirit of enterprise on the part of the
masters, and the exercise of that operative skill on the side of our workmen,
which is still imsurpassed in any iron-producing country of Europe ; but in

this alliance a correct knowledge by both of the competition wc have to meet,

and a thorough belief in the inseparable union of the interests of each, arc

indispensable.

Third Report on the Structure and Ctassifii acion of the Fossil

   Crustacea. By Henry Woodward, F.G.S., F.Z.S., of the British

   Museum.
Since I had the honour to submit to the British Association my last Report

on the Structure and Classification of the Fossil Crustacea, the first part of

my monograph on the Merostomata has been issued by the Palicontographical

Society. About seven more plates are already prepared for the second part,

of some of M^hich I am enabled to exhibit proofs.

   The magnificent collection of remains of this remarkable group of Cnis-
tacca from the Devonian of Forfarshire, belonging to ilr. James Powric,
F.G.S., of Reswallie, are on view in the Volunteer Drill Hall.

  A fine series, comprising several new forms, from the black shales (Upper-

most Silurian) are exhibited at the present Meeting (Panmure St. Chapel) by
Mr. 11. Slimon from Lesmahagow, Lanarkshire, and are M'orthy of a careful
inspection by all who are interested in geology.

    In the immediate neighbourhood of Dundee, at Montrose, at the Univer-
sity of St. Andrews, at Arbroath, at Rossie Priory, and in the "Watt Insti-
tution in the town itself, some of the best specimens ever jxt found of the
remains of Pteryriotus are to be seen ; Avhilst Balruddcry Den, Carmyllie,
and the quarries in the Sidlaw Hills, exhibit the " Arbroath paving-stones "
and overlying fissile shales, whence these remains were procured.

   Among the new forms which have been obtained by Mr. Slimon in his

exploration of the shales of Logan Water, are some almost entire remains
of a form allied to Pteryriotus punctatus (called by Mr. Salter i¥. scorpioides^-),
which prove it to be an Eurypterus and not a Fteryyotus. Another new form
allied to Pt. hiJohus and perornatus, but having the anterior segments much
broader and shorter, and with a somewhat different form of thoracic plate,

  A* MS. label bearing this name is .ittached to a specimen of a portion of this same

species in the Miiseiiui at Jcrmyu Street.

has been met with. It will be needful to modify the specific name of Pt.

bilobus,  as  the  new form,  and  matji:>ero  us  ;  both  have  a  bilobcd  telson  likewise.

If the name is retained, it must be apphed to all three forms thus : Pt.

bilobus, var. inornatus ; Pt. bilobus, xar. crassus* ; Pt. bilobus, \&v. pevornatus.

   In the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, vol. xxii. part 1,
Februaiy 1867, p. 28, and in the British Association Heport for 1866,

p. 180, and Sections, p. 79, I pointed out the affinities of the Limulidie

^\ith the Eurypteridce, and in the first-named paper I recorded all the forms

then known which tended to confirm their alliance.

I have now to notice a new genus from Lesmahagow, Lanarkshire, which

offers further evidence in confii'mation of the correctness of the above-men-

tioucJ classification.

It is a small Limuloid formf, the carapace of which measures only 6 Lines

in breadth and 2 in length, having 5 thoracic and 3 abdominal segments, all
of which appear to be free and distinct. The telson is unfortunately

wanting, the specimen being close to the border of the matrix.

This httle form carries the Limulidce back in time from the Coal-measures

to the Uppermost Silurian, a great and important extension.

   I shall take an early opportunity to describe this form in detail, and to
work out its relationship to Belinurus on the one hand and Hemiaspis on the

other.

                 New Lower Lias Crustacean from Barrow-onSoar.

  A new Crustacean, obtained some years since by Sir Philip Egerton, Bart.,

M.P., from the Lower Lias of Barrow-on-Soar, has since been also found by
Mr. Charles Moore, F.G.S., near Bath. It is quite distinct from every other
form which I have examined from the Lias or Oohte. Its nearest analogue
is the recent Atya scabra of Leach, from South America. The limbs are
monodactylous and extremely rugose ; the antenuaj are rigid, and the basal
joints thick and spinose, resembling in these points of structure the genus
Palinurina. The rostrum is short and curved downwards. The carapace
was extremely thin, and less chitinous than in the genera Aer/er and Pcnceus,
it is therefore more easily destroyed or distorted.

   I propose to name this new form Prcmtija scabrosa.

                             Upper Lias Crustacea from Ilminster.

   Having been favoured with the loan of a large series of specimens for ex-
amination from the Upper Lias of Ilminster, collected by Mr. Charles Moore,
r.G.S., of Bath, I have been enabled to add a considerable number of genera
and species to our list of Liassic Crustacea.

   The two species of Eryon, E. antiquus and E. Moorei, have been already

noticed bj- me from this localitv (see Quart. Joui-n. Geol. Soc. vol. xxii.

p. 499, pi. 25, fig. 3).
   I have since determined the following genera and species, which will be

described at length in a paper by Mr. Charles Moore on the Ikninster Lias,
now in preparation J :

    * This interesting form of bilobus exhibits in one instance well-preserved brancMce, to
which attention was called, and drawings of which were shown by Mr. Woodward.
They will be figured in the Palwontogi-aphical Society's Monograph on the Mcrosto)iiata.

   t The original specimen was exhibited of this, and also figures and specimens of the
other forms from Mr. Slimon's collection, believed to be new.

(Figures and specimens of these new species were exhibited.)

   The above list shows an addition to our Liassic Crustacea of seven genera,
and probably nine species new to Britain.

   It is extremely interesting to notice so many forms common to our Lias

and to the Lithographic stone of Solenhofen in Bavaria.
   The persistence of such forms as Eryon, Eryma, and Qlypluxa through

the whole Oolitic series seems clearly to demonstrate that having escaped
total extinction in the Lower Lias sea, they migrated from time to time to

more favourable areas, and thus were enabled to live on during the periods
of time I'cpresented by the long series of deposits from the Lower Lias to the
Lithographic stone, in which so many examples are found fossil.

                           Oolitic forms of Decapoda Brachyura.

   The genus Prosojwn was established by H. von Meyer for certain minute
forms of Crustacea from the Upper White Jura of Qirlinger Thai, and other
localities in Germany, of which he has described 29 species (see Palaeonto-
graphica for December 1860, vol. vii.). In addition to these he has described
1 species from the Lower Oolite, 3 from the Coral Rag, and 1 from the Neo-

comian.

   Amongst them, however, are placed forms belonging to a widely different
genus in no way related to the Corystidte.

   In Professor Bell's monograph on the Crustacea from the Greensand and
Gault (Pal. Soc. Mon. 1862) he has figured and described one of these, and
has correctly referred it to the Prnnotlicridte, under the generic name of

Plagioplithahnus.

   This genus would probably include the following species of H. von Meyer :
Prosopon hehes, P. simplex, P. rostratum, P. spinosum, P. ehngatum, P. de-
pressum, P. ohlusum, P. Iceve, P. suhlceve, P. punctatum, P. Stotzingense, P.

tuberosum.

   The following are doubtful : P. insigne, P. aquilatwm, P. marginatum,

P. grande, P. excisum, P. lingulatum.

ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF THE METHYL COMPOUNDS. 47

For the remainder the generic name Prosopon should be retained, viz.

P. acideatum, P. ornatum, P. torosum, P. Heydeni, P. cequum, P. paradoxum.

   To this last division I have now the pleasure to add a new British species

from Stonesfield.

   This form was first noticed by Professor Morris, F.Gr.S., who obtained an

imperfect carapace many years since ; it was next observed by Mr. Samuel

Stutterd, of Banbury, but likewise in an imperfect state. The perfect cara-

pace now exhibited was kindly lent me by George Griifith, Esq., M.A., the

AUAssistant-General Secretary of the British Association.  these three

specimens are from Stonesfield, and they add another new genus to our list

of British Oolitic Brachyura. I propose to name it Prosopon mammiUatum.

                    New Fossil Land- Crab from the Lower Eocene,

   Lastly, I wish to call attention to a new genus of Cmstacea from the
Bed Marl of the Plastic Clay, High Cliff", Hampshire, and is, I beheve, the
first discovered example of a British land-crab, or shore-crab, yet met with.

Its oblong quadrangular-shaped carapace, with obtusely rounded anterior
angles and short blunt rostrum, remind one immediately of the Ocypoda. In
addition to this, the eyes have extremely elongated pediincles, which are
seen preserved in the fossil, lying in the groove along the fronto -orbital
margin of the carapace, as in the recent genera Gelasimus, Macrophthalmus,
and Ocypoda. The hands are both small ; and from this, as well as from the
very broad posterior border of the carapace, I infer that this is a female
example, as in most of the recent species of Quadrangulares the male has one
hand enormously developed for burrowing, whereas the hands of the female
are both small and very feeble. The other limbs are, like those of the recent
species, well formed for rapid movement along the ground. I propose to

name this interesting little Cmstacean Goniocypoda Edwardsi, in honour of

the great French carcinologist to whom science is so much indebted*.

       Report on the Physiological Action of tKe Methyl Compounds.

          By Benjamin W. Richardson, M.A., M.D., F.R.S.

In the present paper I produce the fourth of a series of Eeports which I have
had the honour to prepare for the British Association. The Eeports have all
had relation to the physiological action of bodies of organic type. The first

Report treated of the action of the substance known as nitrite of amyl. The
second was on amyUc alcohol, acetate of amyl, and iodide of amyl. The third
was on the nitrite of amyl as a remedy, and the action of the amyls as anti-

septics ; it included also notes of a research on the physiological action of
absolute ether, hydrofluoric ether, acetate of ethyl, and nitrite of ethyl.

   As the matter of the present Report is long, I shall not attempt to reca-
pitulate at any length the results of previous Reports ; I shall be content to
offer as the more salient points the following facts :

    In respect to the amyls

   1. Nitrite of amyl was found to be the most active known excitant of the

circulation.

48 REPORT--1867.

   2. All the compounds of amyl which were studied were found to modify i."
a singular manner the motive animal power.

   3. One compound, amylene, is an anaesthetic.
   4. All the amyls were found to be antisejjtics ; and acetate of amyl, it was
suggested, might probably be used, on an extensive scale, for the preservation

of animal substances.
   In respect to the ethyls
   1. Pure oxide of ethyl was found to be the best and safest anaesthetic for

general anaesthesia.

   2. Hydrofluoric ether was found to be a most powerful agent for the de-
struction or resolvency of living animal tissues.

   3. Nitrite of ethyl was discovered to possess an action similar to that of

--the nitrite of amyl, but with this striking difference in young animals, that

when they are made to receive it until they seem to be quite dead, they

will remain as if dead for eight and even ten minutes, and will then faintly
recommence to breathe, the heart following in its action ; this condition, look-
ing like an actual return of life, will sometimes last as long as half an hour,
and will then gradually cease, the animal lapsing into actual inertia or death.

    Such are a few of the facts elicited by these preceding researches ; but as
the Association is always anxious to learn what practical results have been
obtained from its works, or from works performed under its auspices, I shall
be pardoned if I refer to one or two of the results that have followed upon

the present series of Reports.

   The experimental tniths which have been brought out in regard to the
nitrite of amyl have led to the application of this substance to the alleviation
of human suffering. Dr. Heydon of Dublin has used the nitrite with advan-
tage in the treatment of cholera, in the later stages of the malady. DDuted
with ether in the proportion of 5 per cent., the nitrite has been shown
to exert a marked controlling inHuencc over painful spasmodic breathing
and I hear that Dr. Brunton, of Edinburgh, has resorted to it with great
success in the treatment of one of the most terrible of all maladies, cardiac
apnoea, or angina pectoris.

   The Report last year on ether, although written very briefly, has excited
much practical interest both here and in America. It has led to the intro-
duction iuto medicine of a more stable and reliable ether compound ; and it
has caused many surgeons to return, with satisfaction, to the iise of ether as
an anaesthetic in preference to the more dangerous agent chloroform.

   It is my hope that the Report now in hand, and which at the request of

the Committee is, this year, on the Methyl compounds, will not prove of less

service.

RESEARCH ON THE METHYLS.

The methyl series of organic compounds are already known in physiologi-

cal science through one or two of their representatives, direct or substituted.

Thus we have in the series the hydride of methyl, or marsh-gas, or fire-

damp, which, as a cause of death, has been generally studied, and which, in-

deed, has not escaped the intelhgent observation of Mr. Nunneley, of Leeds,

as an anaesthetic agent. Then, again, as substitution-products of this scries,

we have the well-known agent  chloroform, the  terchloride of formylc                                                                                              and
                                                                                                                                                                ;

lastly, we have a substance concerning which there has been considerable

discussion of late, the tetrachloride of carbon, also an anaesthetic.

   Before I go further, and that all may be carried with me, let me briefly
--

ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF THE METHYL COMPOUNDS. 49

state what compounds of the methyl series arc about to engage our attention,
and what is their nature and derivation.

   The most common methyl-compound, that, in fact, which came first to the
use of the world at large, is what is called methyl-alcohol or wood-spirit-

--naphtha, a substance which comes over in combination with water during the

dry distillation of wood. Chemically considered, this and all the other bodies
of the series are constructed on a radical called methyl. This radical, whicli
has only been isolated by one or two observers, exists as a permanent gas. Its

composition, according to the new formula, is C H^.
   Prom this radical we have handed to us by the chemist two sets of com-

pounds. In one set we have the radical acting as a base, producing by com-
bination with other elements bodies which may be taken as the analogues of
salts. In the second set we have the carbon continuing steady, but the hy-
drogen replaced by some other element. For convenience sake, I will place
such compounds as I have studied physiologically in two groups, as fol-

lows :

       Physiological action op Methy'lic Alcohol.

The methylic alcohol used was the pure alcohol. It is a colourless spirit,

its specific gravity 0-810, its boiling-point 140° Pahr. The physiological ac-

tion may be obtained either by dii-ect administration witli water, or by inha-

lation of the vapour. When the methylic alcohol is thus administered so as

to produce distinct efi'ects, the first symptoms are those of excitement followed

by languor. These symptoms are succeeded by laboured breathing, and soon

by gaspings, and by deep sighs which occur at intervals of about foiu:

seconds. There is evidenced upon this, want of power in the limbs with rol-

ling movements on the side and complete intoxication. Prom this time, if

the dose of the alcohol is continued, the animal lapses into utter prostration,

and the breathing becomes blowing, with what is technically called bron-

chial rale, due to the passage of air through fluid in the finer bronchial pas-

sages. Throughout all these stages of intoxication there is imperfect

1867.                                                                                      E
--50 REPORT 1867.

-- --anaesthesia, and, up to what would seem the extremity of living action, sbme

evidence of sensibility reflex is shown when irritation is applied. Brought
to the lowest state of prostration by methylic alcohol, an animal will always
recover slowly in a warm atmosphere ; the period required for recovery being
from four to six hom-s at 65° F. Diuing recovery there are no active con-
vulsive movements, and tremors are not marked symptoms.

   When the intoxication arising from methylic alcohol is carried to the ex-

tent of destrojdng life, the respiration and circulation cease almost simulta-
neously. The lungs are left with a fair amount of blood, and both sides of

the heart contain blood. The brain is much engorged with blood, and aU the
vascular organs are in the same state. The blood is not objectively changed
in character. At fi^rst, during the state of excitement, it gives to the external
vascular parts a marked redness ; but as the symptoms are more permanent

on the one side, or as recovery is pronounced on the other side, this passes
away. The coagulation of blood is somewhat prolonged, but is not pre-

vented.

   The evidence, on the whole, is to the effect that methylic alcohol influences
principally the motor centres of the neiwous system. At all events these
centres are prominently influenced, and it is probably only when they begin
to fail that the centres of consciousness and sensation succumb. In this
respect the methylic, the ethylic, and the amylic alcohols have a common
action. But on comparing the effects generally of methylic alcohol with those
of amylic and of ethylic or common alcohol, I find the methylic much less
potent. It produces prostration and muscular paralysis more quickly, but from
that prostration recovery is far more rapid. I showed, previously, in regard to
amylic alcohol that when the loss of power of the animal under its influence
is complete a peculiar symptom is developed, viz. a universal tremor, accom-
panied with a very deep inspiration. There is no spasm, no pain, no rigidity,
but, in medical language, rigors of an intense kind. These rigors are soon
established in regular rhythm, and by maintaining the experiment cautiously,

they may be kept up for several hours. I have seen them for one hour at
the rate of sixteen in a minute as regularly as possible, and by reduction
of the agent have lowered them to twelve, eight, and foiu* per minute. All

through the breathing is tranquil and the action of the heart good. The
rigor occurs spontaneously in this manner, but it can be excited at any mo-
ment by touching the animal or blowing upon it, or even by a sharp noise,
such as the snap of the finger. "When the animal is reduced to entire insen-
sibility, if it be laid in the open air it begins to recover its sensibility at
once, but the power to move is suspended for two or three hours, and the
rigors also continue, but with decreasing force and frequency. Ultimately

the animal recovers thoroughly, and is always very eager for food. When

these urgent and, as they would seem, extreme symptoms are carried to their
full extent, even an experienced observer would think that recovery wei-e im-
possible; but in truth the animal cannot be killed by any fair play with amylic
alcohol. In order actually to kill, it is necessary to complicate the experi-
ment by actual reduction of air, or by closing the chamber and retaining the
carbonic acid of the breath. I showed again, in regard to ethylic alcohol,
that in a minor degree these same symptoms were developed. In poisoning
by metliylic alcohol these symptoms are ncarlj- altogether absent. The recovery
is not only rapid, but casj', approaching, in fact, recoveiy from the inhala-

tion of ether.

    I notice specially this difference of action of the three analogous alcohols
        ON THE niYSIOLOaiCAL ACTION OF THE METHYL COMPOUNDS. 51

for two reasons ; first, because the fact is an exposition of a general physio-
logical law in relation to bodies of the same series ; and secondly, because
there is a practical lesson behind bearing upon the employment of these sub-
stances. The physiological law is this, that the period of time required by
these bodies to produce their effects, and the period of time required for re-
covery, turns altogether on the evaporating-point of the fluid used. This is so
certain that when in an analogous series of fluids the action of one of the

series is well learned, the action of the others may be safely predicted from

--the boiling-point. In illustration, here are these three alcohols amylic

alcohol, ethylic alcohol, and mcthylic ; the first boils at 270° Fahr., the

second at 174°, the third at 140°. If wo intoxicate three animals of the
same kind with these alcohols, carrying the symptoms in each case to the

same degree, and then leave the animals to recover in the same temperature,

--say 60°, then if the animal in the methylie alcohol be four hours recovering,

the one in ethylic alcohol will be seven hours, and the one in amylic will be

sixteen hours.

    The explanation of this fact is very simple, and reduces the phenomenon
to a question, I had almost said, of mechanical force. The alcohols taken
into the body enter into no combination which changes their composition.
They pass out of the body chemically as they entered it, and theii- evolution
and the time of their evolution is a mere matter of so much expenditure of
force (caloric) to raise them and carry them off. To test this more directly,
intoxicated animals were placed in different degrees of temperature with the
unerring result of a quickened recovery in the higher degrees.

   The practical lessons I would refer to are two in number. I would sug-
gest that in all cases of alcohohc poisoning in the human subject, the most
important condition for recovery is a high temperature. The use of the hot-
air bath raised to 150° or even 180° would be the most perfect means of re-
covery. Next I would point out that as methyhc alcohol is much more rapid
in its action, and much less prolonged in its effects than is common alcohol, it
would be used with great advantage by tlie physiological physician in all
cases where he feels a demand for an alcohoHc that shall act instantly, and

with the least possible ultimate expenditure of animal force for its elimina-
tion. It must be observed that in the end aU these alcoholic bodies are
depressants, and although at first, by their caUiug vigorously into play the
natural force,- they seem to excite, and are therefore called stimulants ; they
themselves supply no force at any time, but take up force, by which means

they get away and therewith lead to exhaustion and paralysis of power. In
other words, the calorific force which should be expended on the nutrition and
sensation of the body is expended on the alcohol.

   I have only to acid to this recommendation of methylie alcohol as a me-
dicine in substitution for common alcohol, that the methylie spirit when quite
pure is extremely palatable, that it mixes easily with water, hot or cold, and
that it makes excellent toddy in the proportion of half an ounce to half a
pint of hot water. In a conversation I had a few days ago with one of those

veterans in physic, Avho links the medicine of the last generation with the

present, he told me that the most celebrated physician and scholar of his

acquaintance ha.ving once tasted wood-spirit took to it as a drink, and Hked
it so much better than any other stimulant that he held to it to the last, to
the long term of well nigh ninety years.

                                                                         e2

        TnE Hydride of Methyl.

The hydride of methyl occurs naturally in the form of firedamp in mines,

and marsh-gas on land. It is made artifically by heating together in a strong
flask acetate of soda, caustic potash, and well-dried lime. For physiological
experiment the hydride of methyl can only be administered by inhalation. It
is a pleasant gas to inhale, producing no irritation, nor yet giving rise to any
of those feelings of excitement which are induced by nitrous oxide gas, or

the vapour of chloroform.

   As the gas is often a cause of death in mines, I thought it was worth in-
quu-ing what percentage of it would prove fatal in the air. I therefore had
constructed a glass chamber through which an atmosphere charged with

known quantities of the gas could be passed. To my surprise I found that

even pigeons, animals peculiarly susceptible to the influence of narcotic gases,

could live in an air charged with not less than 35 per cent, of the gas for the
space of half an hour, while I could myself inhale the air coming from

their chamber without anxiety.

   When by pushing the inhalation further death is induced, it is as a very
gentle sleep, so gentle indeed that it is dilRcult to say when the action

either of the circulation or of the respiration is over. The lungs are left

with blood in them, the heart has blood on both sides, and the blood itself

retains its natural character. The death is by the slow negation of breath-

Weing.  may gather from these facts many important lessons in regard to

the risks and dangers of miners from firedamp. I should think it is almost

impossible that any body of men, or any men who were awake in a mine,

could be so entrapped witli fii-edamp only as to die in the absence of an ex-

plosion. In accidents where this seems to have occurred, I should imagine

that with the firedamp there is also evolved carbonic acid gas. I can, how-

ever, imagine after an explosion, when the mine becomes for a moment a

great vacuum, that there would be sufficient entrance of the gas to produce

a fatal atmosphere. In such case death would be prolonged, but as easy as

--sleep ; two truths, which in cases of accident should inspire thankfulness and

hope thankfulness that those who thus die for us suffer little, hope as to

the possibility of rescue which should not for days be abandoned. The best

direct means of recoveiy of those under the influence of firedamp is expo-

siu-e to heated air, with the administration of warm nourishing drinks, such as

milk. Alcoholics do decided harm.

[From this point the author proceeded at length A\ath the descriptions of

the actions of chloride of methyl, the iodide, bromide, and acetate, methj'lic

ether, nitrite of methyl, and the nitrate, wliich we must very briefly record,

and pass to his researches on chloroform and its allies.]

                                         Chloride of Methyl.

   The chloride of methyl made by the direct action of hydrochloric acid on

methylic alcohol can only be conveniently used for physiological purposes,
as a gas, or as a gas saturating ether. It must therefore be administered by

inhalation to see its full effect. I took some of it by the mouth in solution
with ether, but the heat of the mouth prevented me from swallowing it per-
fectly. Inhaled Avith atmospheric air, in the proportion of 15 per cent, it
produces in all animals good ana}sthesia, without excitement and with excel-

lent recovery. Carried to the extent of causing death, the action of the
heart outlives the respiration ; the lungs are left with blood in the pulmonic

                                                                                  *

circuit, and both sides of the heart are filled with blood which is little
changed in colour. The muscles retain their irritability after death, and are
capable of response to galvanism for two and even three hours after death,
while the heart will continue to pulsate spontaneously for half an hour or

even forty minutes.

              Iodide op Methtl.

   The iodide of methyl that was used was made, in the usual way, by distil-
ling wood-spirit with iodine and phosphorus ; viz. 12 of spirit with 8 of
iodine, and 1 of phosphorus. The fluid at first was nearly colouiiess, and
boiled at 108° Fahr., its sp. gr. being 2-199. Although kept well excluded
from the light it underwent slight change, setting iodine free. It is altoge-

ther a very difficult compoiuid to manipulate with, physiologically, in the con-

centrate form. It can be managed better when diluted with methylic alcohol
or with ether. I succeeded, however, to subject animals to the vapour, and

discovered that in proportions of 10 per cent, the action of the iodide is the

same as that of the chloride, i. e. it is a very good anaesthetic. When, how-
ever, the iodine is escaping there is profuse lachrymation and salivation.
There is also free secretion from the bronchial surface, and one animal died
I'rom this accidental bronchitis some hours after it had recovered from the

anaesthesia.

              Beomide or Methyl,

   The bromide of methyl, the analogue of the chloride and iodide, bromine
taking the place of chlorine or iodine, is a substance having a specific gravity
of 1-660, and a boiling-point of 55° F. I used it in experiment by inhalation
alone, and also in combination with ether in equal parts. It Avas discovered
as good an anfesthetic as the chloride, and recovery was perfect ; but there
was some degree of irritation and sahvation excited, results probably due to
free bromine. The irritation is produced chiefly in the eyes and in the
salivary glands, causing lachrymation and salivation.

              Acetate of Methyl.

   The acetate of methyl obtained by distilhng acetate of soda, oil of vitriol,
and methyhc alcohol, with rectification over lime and chloride of calcium, is
a clear fluid with an agreeable odour. Its specific gravity is -910, and its
boiling-point 13G° Fahi-. It is administered easily by inhalation, and in four

minutes, in the proportion of 9 per cent., it produces gentle sleep with quick
recovery if the administration be short. Prolonged inhalation causes difficult
breathing. It is a substance which admits of being largely used in medicine,
in cases where a diaphoretic and narcotic are required in combination.

                                            Methylic Ethee.

   This substance, obtained by the action of sulphuric acid on methylic alcohol,
is a gas at ordinary temperatures, and does not admit of being used physio-
logically in any other state. It has an agreeable odour, and is taken up
easily by ether. I used it most conveniently with ether, liberating it by heat
below the boiling-point of the ether. Administered by inhalation it produced
perfect anaesthesia, and that in an easy and rapid manner. The breathing
is scarcely disturbed, and the action of the heart is extremely regular. Ee-
covery is not very rapid, but perfect.
--54 KEPORT 1867.

                                 Nitrite and Nitrate of Methyl.

    The nitrite and tlie nitrate of methyl possess an action so much in com-
 mon that I may take them together. The nitrite made by the action of ni-
 trous acid on methylic alcohol is most conveniently used with ether. The
 nitrate made by distilling the wood-spirit with nitrate of potash and suljihuric

 acid can be used directly. It is a heavy liquid, having a specific gravity of
 1-180 and a boiling-point of 140° Fahr.

    As with the nitrites of amyl and ethyl, the action of these substances is
 to produce intense excitement and rapid action of the heart and arteries.
 The action, however, is not so vehement as from nitrite of amyl, and a lon-
 ger inhalation is required before the excitement is perceived. In the human
 subject the face becomes red, the vessels of the head seem fall and distended,
 and the pulse is readily brought up to 120 and even 130. On the inferior
 animals the same excitement is manifested, and death is preceded by convul-
 sive jerks. After death the lungs are found collapsed and v.liite, and the
heart flaccid and full of blood on both sides. On exposure to the air the
 heart recommences to contract, and continues its contractions for long periods,
 in one case (a rabbit being the subject) for forty minutes. The blood in the
 blood-vessels remains fluid for an hour or more, but coagulates readily on
 exposure to a Avarm air. The muscles througliout the whole of the body are
 flaccid, but will contract, for periods of one and two hours after death, under
 the influence of the galvanic current. Neither nitrite nor nitrate of methyl

produce true ana3sthcsia.
    Of the two substances the nitrate of methyl is most conveniently used,

and as it possesses aU the physiological properties of nitrite of amyl with less
energy, it would, I tliink, be the best agent in medicine. Its power in pro-
ducing muscular relaxation is most marked and general, and its employmcjit
in cases of a desperate spasmodic character, as in tetanus, would be a ratioiial

scientific procedure.

    I now come to the second group of substances to which I have directed

attention; viz., cliloroform, tetrachloride of carbon, and bichloride of metliy-

lene.

                                                   Chloroform.

    Chloroform made by the action of bleaching-powder on methylic alcohol,
or ethylic alcohol, is a substance so well known as an anaesthetic that I shall
dwell but very briefly upon it. It has a specific gravity of 149.5, and it boils
at 142° Eahr. From the large number of experiments I have made v.'ith this
substance to determine its mode of action, and the manner in which it some-
times destroys life, I am led to the conclusion that its fii-st influence is always

exerted on the centres of motion of the nervous system with an extension of

that action to the centres of volition and sensation. I agree with Dr. Snow

in tracing out four distinct stages in its action, one of gentle excitement of
the circulation, a second of exalted action of the motor centres, a tliird of
depression of motion with destruction of consciousness, and a fourth of com-
plete paralysis of motion and sensation. I have also been led slowly to the
conviction that the cause of death from chloroform is in every case due to
arrest of nervous function, and that the idea of any direct action of tlic agent
on the muscular structure of the heart is without foundation. In eighty-seven
experiments conducted specially to determine the direct influence of chloro-
form on the heart, I found in every case that organ capable of reaction on its
                                                                      --

exposure to the air, and the lungs always bloodless, white, and collapsed ; I

found, in fact, precisely the same state of things as occm-s when the medulla
oblongata is rendered inactive by extreme cold. The mean period of timo

during which the muscles respond to galvanism after death by chloroform
varies from twenty minutes to half an hour. The coagulation of the blood

is natural.

   The advantages of chloroform over other anaesthetics, so far known, are its
readiness of application, and the prolonged action of the ana3sthesia induced.
Its maiu disadvantage lies in its high boiling-point, and the consequent
amount of force required to eliminate it from the body. Indeed, according

to my experience it is never eliminated purely by the lungs, but by all the
excreting organs, so that any error or deficiency in those organs may lead to
such suppression of elimination that the nervous centres may become over-

whelmed, with consequent arrest of their activity. The 'temperature of the
air exerts a marked inlluence on the effects of chloroform in this respect of
elimination ; the influence of the anaesthetic being greatly prolonged when
the air is loaded with moisture and the thermometer is low. The best means
of restoration in impending death from chloroform is the introduction into
the lungs by artificial respiration of air heated to 130° Fahr. Under this
influence, in animals even with the chest Inid open, the heart is seen to leap
into instant activity and the arteries to recommence pulsation. In one expe-
riment this restoration of vascular motion was so distinct that the blood made
its way round the arterial circuit, the nervous centres regained power, and

the animal (a dog) may be said temporarily to have lived again.
   To fill the lungs with warm air for the purpose described, a small pair of

handbeUows connected with a tube of thin metal, in a coil, answers well.
With a spirit lamp the coil can be almost instantly made hot, and the air
passing through it with brisk force can easily be raised to 130° Fahr. It is
only necessary to inject the air through one nostril.

Teteachlokide of Caeboi]-.

--Recently, the substance known as C Cl^ the tetrachloride of carbon

has been brought into use as a substitute for chloroform. In this body aU

the hydrogen elements of marsh-gas are substituted by chlorine, and it is

indeed the final result of the action of chlorine on that gas. It is a fluid of

not very pleasant odour; its boiling-point is 172° Fahr., its specific gra-\dty

is 1-600. As this substance is now gaining importance, I have thought

myit proper to subject it to very careful experiment, and I feel it  duty to

state, both on theoretical and practical grounds, that it is more dangerous

than chloroform, and it' it were as generally used it would act fataUy in

a much larger number of cases. In its action it presents the same four

stages as chloroform, but the second stage is more prolonged and intensified.

In one animal (a rabbit) tetanic convulsion of an extreme character was

presented diuing this stage. But the worst feature in the administration
of this body is the slowness of its elimination, a slowness fuUy accounted
for by the boihug-point. Saturating the nervous centres, and expending
their force to the fullest, it kiUs far more quickly and determiiiately than

chloroform, and so completely is motion paralyzed that the muscles scarcely
respond to galvanism five minutes after dissolution. In order to make an
exact comparison (and it is from this comparison I draw the results arrived
at), I placed animals of the same kind, at the same time, at the same tem-
--56 REPORT 1867.

perature in chambers of the same size, and administered the same doses of
chloroform and of the tetrachloride of carbon. Pigeons and rabbits alike
gave evidence of the more severe effects of the Inttcr substance. In this opi-

nion my friend Dr. Sedgwick, who has rendered me the most valued aid in

these inquiries, entirely coincides.

                               The Bichloeide of Methtlexe.

    The last compound on our list is of great interest, from the circumstance
that it promises to be a new and valuable anaesthetic. In experimenting
with chloride of methyl in ether, I was so struck with its good action that I
asked Mr. Bobbins, the chemist who has prepared the compounds for me, to
endeavoiu' to find a more stable compound, having similar physical properties,

from the methyl series. In a few days he brought me the fluid I now place
before the Section, made for him by Dr. Versman. This fluid is the bichlo-

ride of methylene. It is formed by the action of nascent hydrogen on
chloroform, and it differs from chloroform in that one atom of chlorine is re-
placed by an atom of hydrogen. Its boiling-point is 88° Fahr, and the odour

of its vapour is sweet and much like that of chloroform. On testing it phy-

siologically I found it to be a gentle and perfect general anaesthetic. Under
its influence animals lapse into the third stage of anassthesia, with the
slightest exhibiton of the stage of excitement. The insensibility is deep and

weU sustained, and the recovery quiet and good. [Dr. Eichardson liero

showed an experiment of putting a pigeon into a deep sleep.] In some
experiments, in order to see the extreme effect, I have carried the adminis-
tration to the extent of arresting the phenomena of life. I have thus learned
that the respiration and circulation, under the last action of this agent, cease
simultaneously, and that the muscles retain their ii-ritability for even an
hour after death. The lungs are left M'ith blood in the respiratory circuit,
both sides of the heart are charged with blood, and the blood itself remains
unaltered in physical property. Compared with other antesthetics, the bichlo-

ride of methylene appears to me to combine the anaesthetic power of chloro-

form with the safer properties of ether. It is too early to speak positively on
this point, but if the expectation be fulfilled, the perfection of a general
anaesthetic will have been obtained for the benefit of the world. And, even

should this happy result not be accomplished, the way at least is paved to-

wards the discovery of some intermediate body wliich shall answer to the re-
quired jDhysical demand.

    In renewing all the facts connected with the physiological action of the
methyl series, w"e gather that, according to their composition, they exert cer-
tain definite influences on different parts of the nervous organism. The oxide
produces an influence of its own, that of slowly paralyzing the motor func-
tion before destroying common sensibility. The nitrite and nitrate rapidly
paralyze the centres of motion; while the chloride, the iodide, and the bromide,
together with the substitution chlorine compounds, not only paralyze motion
but also destroy sensation. I conclude this Eeport with one other observa-

tion. At first sight it may seem that the isolation of the phenomena pro-
duced by special agents, and the discovery of a new antesthetic are sufficient

characteristics of this research. "With every respect, I submit that a broader

question is involved. At the Meeting at Birmingham I suggested, almost
with a feeling of fear, that out of these studies might spring up a fixed prin-

ciple of therapeutical discovery. Now I have the conscious happiness of

kno-mng that the hypothesis was correct. I feel convinced, on this longer
experience, that by continued labour vre shall be able to pronounce the pre-
cise physiological meaning and value of aU the organic compounds, to extend
the knowledge of the cm-ative action of these compounds to every condition
of disease that is physically remediable, and to bring therapeutics into the

position of a positive science.

   "WTiile these Transactions have been in preparation the opportunity has

been afforded me of testing the action of bichloride of methylene as a general
anaesthetic on the human subject, and with the happiest results. On October

15th of last year (1S67), having first inhaled the vapour myself to complete
anaesthesia, I afterwards administered it to a lady wliile Mr. Spencer Wells
performed one of the formidable operations in surgery. Not one imfavour-

ablc symptom resulted, and since thc7i the bichloride of methylene has been

in frequent use in surgery. Tp to the present time (January 20, 1S6S) no

Preliminary Report of the Committee for the Exploration of the
    Plant Beds of North Greenland, appointed at the Nottingham

    Meeting, 1866.

Mr. "WnYMPER, one of the Members of the Committee, having made arrange-
ments for visiting Greenland, a meeting of the Committee was held on the
4th of April, in London, and it was there resolved that the sum of £1U0
voted by the British Association for the purposes of this exploration be
handed to Mr. Whymper, on his giving a written undertaking to fulfil the
conditions laid down by the Association, as far as lay in his power.

   In addition to this grant, Mr. AVhymper was further assisted by a grant of
.£200 from the Government Grant Committee of the Eoyal Society.

   Mr. Whymper started from Copenhagen about the 20th of April, taking
with him as assistant Dr. Eobert Brown, a gentleman already well known

for his explorations in North-west .imerica, especially as to the Natural
History of British Columbia.

    Since the expedition left Copenhagen, no intelligence from it has been
received by this Committee.

   The description of the plant remains from North Greenland which have
been already brought to these countries has been completed by Prof. Oswald
Heer of Zuiich, and his work on the ' Fossil Plora of the Polar Eegions ' is
now nearly printed, and will be published in a short time.

Method of Condeiisation.

The following method of condensation was drawn up by the Committee in

order that it might be followed as far as practicable. In some cases the

nature of the data rendered deviations from the method in matters of detail

unavoidable ; but its principles have been adiiered to throughout.

   1. All results belonging to any special theory, and aU quantities calculated
approximately by inference, or ascertained otherwise than by dii'ect mea-

surement, to be excluded from the condensed Tables.

  E2. Vessels for which any of the essential data (marked in. the annexed

list) are wanting to be excluded.

3. The remaining vessels to be divided into groups, according to their

speed on trial ; for example,

Group 1, below                     7 knots.

   In drawing up the preceding form of arrangement, the Committee have had
iu view not only the guidance of themselves and their calculators, but the in-

formation of those Avho may hereafter furnish the British Association ^ith

data as to the performance of steamships.
   Paddle steamers, screw steamers, and men-of-war have been separately

condensed and grouped.
    In condensing the Tables of the ships of war, there are vessels of which

many trials were reported. The mean of the majority of trials with the same

draught and the same propeller have been given in this Report,
   The diameter of the paddle-wheel, as given in the condensed Tables, is the

diameter as returned iu the printed Reports, and must not be confounded
with the effective diameter of the wheel. In only a few cases the effective
diameter has been returned, and even upon these quantities very small de-
pendence can be placed. For example, in Table V., Report ISGl, the diameter
of paddle-wheel of the ' Delta ' is 26 feet, and the effective diameter is given
as 22 feet ; the ' Lima ' has the same diameter of wheel, but the effective
diameter is given as 25-16 feet. Both are feathering wheels, and there is
only a difference of 1-5 feet iu the width of the float, the ' Delta having
a float 4-5 feet broad, and the ' Lima ' a float of 3 feet broad.

   * The length of the nautical mile is vai-ioiisly estimated. By the British Admiralty, it

is defined to be one minute of the equator, which, according to the latest detorniinali'ons,
is G08(5 feet. Another estimate is the mean length of a minute of latitude, or 0070 feet.
Most of the speeds in the Tables are given in Admiralty knots.

      On the Meteorology of Port Louis in the Island of Mauritius.
                        By Charles Meldrum, M.A.

                           [A communication ordered to be printed in extenso.'\

MATJEiTiirs Kes nearly between the parallels of 20° and 21° S. latitude and
the meridians of 57° and 58° E. longitude. With the exception of the small
islands of Reunion, Eodrigues, and the Cargados, which are from 100 to 300
miles distant, the nearest land is Madagascar, about 500 miles due west.

The nearest point of Africa is about 1100 miles W. b. N., and of India about

2000 mUes N.E. b. N. Towards the E.N.E., E., and E.S.E., are the Indian
archipelago and Australia, at distances of 2600 to 3400 miles ; while to the
southward an almost unbroken ocean stretches away to the polar seas.

   Thus surrounded by a great expanse of ocean, especially to windward,

Mauritius may be regarded as a locality in which the meteorological elements
may be determined in a form comparatively free from the complications

caused by neighbouring masses of land.
    The island itself, -which is of volcanic origin, has an area of 700 square

miles, and is of an oval form. Its greatest length is 39 miles, and its
greatest breadth 34 miles. Nearly one-third of it is under the cultivation

of the sugar-cane, the other two-thirds consisting chiefly of pastiu-age,

forest, and mountaia. In the interior, and more or less surrounded by three
chains of mountains, varying from 1000 to nearly 3000 feet in height, and
sending off spurs towards the coast, is a tableland, -which attains an eleva-
tion of 800 to 1400 feet, and a considerable portion of which has of late
years been planted with the sugar-cane, the primeval forests having, to a
great extent, been cut down for the purpose. Between tlicse mountain-
chains and the shore, particularly in the northern parts of the island, are
plains generally covered -with sugar-cane, and gently sloping to the sea,
above which they are but little elevated. For beauty and variety of scenery,
for bold mountains, generally clothed halfway up their steep sides with ever-
green trees and shrubs, and rearing their naked heads against skies of the
softest blue, for rugged precipices, fantastic knolls, peaks, and ridges, for
tangled forests, deep ravines and caverns, picturesque waterfalls, shady groves,
and rich fertUe plains and valleys, this little island is perhaps unsurpassed.

    The Observatory is situated on the west side of the harbour of Port Louis,
 on the north-west coast of the island, in 20° 9' 5G" S., and 57° 29' 30" E.
It stands upon a coral-rock. Erom "NY.S.W. to E.N.E., through the east, it
is suiTOunded by a chain of mountains rising to the height of 700 to 2707
feet. As these mountains bear in the direction from -which the prevailing
 -wind blows, and are only from a quarter of a mile to a mile and a half dis-

 tant, the position of the Observatory is not very favourable.

    The observations which form the basis of this communication embrace a

--period of seven years, namely 1860 to 1866 inclusive.
    There are two classes of observations, 1st, observations taken daily at
 3| A.M., 9| A.M., 3| P.M., and 9| p.m. ; and, 2nd, observations taken hourly
 on the 21st of each month.

    The former are referred to as the six-hourly observations, and the latter as

 the term-day observations.

    As the principal use of the term-day observations is for determining the
 epochs of the turning-points and the range of the meteorological elements

 in their diurnal march, they are not, like the six -hourly observations, dis-
             ON THE METEOROLOGY OF PORT LOUIS.                         109

 cussed for the whole period, Liit for such portions of it as have been deemed

 sufficient for the object in view.

    The instruments are by Newman, J^egretti and Zambra, and Casella, and

have been compared with the Greenwich and Kew standards. The barometer,

the tube of which has an interior diameter of -564 inch, is, with the thermo-
meters, 30 feet above the sea-level. The rain-gauge and solar thermometers
are 40 feet above the ground, and the vane of Osier's anemometer 10 feet
above the highest point of the building.

   From 1852 to 1859 a sinular series of observations was taken by the

Koyal Engineers, in a tower about 400 yards west of the Observatory ; so
that the two series embrace a period of 14 years. I confine myself to the

second series (1860-66), taken under my own direction. The results are

given in 42 Tables, to which I beg to prefix a few remarks, intended to
direct attention to some of the more salient features. I begin with the

temperature.

                      I. Tempekatuee.

--Diiinwl Variation. The last line but one in Table I. exhibits the mean

temperature of the air at 3i a.m., 9^ a.m.. 3| p.m., and 9| p.m. The means

for these hours are 75°-50, 77°-59,' 78°-99, and 76°-36, respectively, which

gives a mean daUy temperature of 77°- 11. The last line shows the excess

or defect of the mean for each observation hour on the mean (77°-ll) of

the 10,220 observations taken during the whole period of seven years.

As the intervals between the observation hours are considerable, it is neces-

sary, in order to obtain more complete information regarding the diurnal

march of the temjierature, to have recourse to the hourly observations taken

on the term-days. The results of these, for a period of four years, are pre-

sented in Table II., in which the last column but one gives the mean tem-

Weperature for each hour, commencing with 6 a.m.  perceive that there is

a single progression, having one ascending and one descending branch, the

temperature gradually increasing from 75°-55 at 6 a.m. to 79°-43 at 1 p.m.,

and then decreasing till 6 a.m. This progression, it need scarcely be

remarked, is dependent on the earth's rotation on its axis with regard to the

sun. In the last column is presented the amount by which the mean for

each hour falls short of (-- ), or exceeds (-|-), the mean for the 24 hours
We(77°-14).
             see that there are nine hours, namely, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.

inclusive, during which the temperature is above the mean for the day, and

fifteen hom's during which it is below the mean. The range is 3°-88, The

greatest increase in any two hours takes place between 9 and 11 a.m., and
amounts to 1°-81, and the greatest faU in any two hours from 3 to 5 p.m.,
and amounts to 1°. The mean temperature for the day occurs very nearly

at 9 A.M. and 7 p.m.

   On inspecting the other columns, which give the diurnal variation for
each month, it may be seen that, though the minimum generally occurs at
6 A.M., and the maximum at 1 p.m., the epochs of the turning-points vary a

little with the season.

   Comparing Tables I. and II., we find that the mean daUy temperature is

almost identical in both, being 77°-ll in the one, and 77°-14 in the other,

--notwithstanding the fewness of the observations in the latter case.
    Greatest Diurnal Range. Table III. shows the greatest range of tem-
perature, on any one day, in each month, obtained fi'om daily observations of

the maximum and minimum thermometers for five years (1862-1866). It

\\i)l be seen that the greatest range on any one day during that period was
110 REPORT--1867.

13°, in ITarcli 1866, and tlie least of the extreme diurnal ranges G"^-i, in
October and jSTovember 1862, and that the greatest variations of temperature

--take place diu'ing the summer months, namely, from November to May.
   Least Diurnal Range. The least range of temperatiu-e, on any one day,
during the same five years, was l°-4 in June 1866, and the greatest of the
least diurnal ranges 6° in January 1865, as appears from Table lY., "which
likewise sho'ws that the summer months are subject to greater fluctuations

of temperatiu'e than the svinter months.

  --Mean Diurnal Range. Table V., in which the mean diurnal range for

each month is given, shows that the mean diurnal range for the year is

--6°-69, and that the greatest fluctuations occiu- in the summer months.
   Annual Variation. The annual march of the temperature, derived from

the daily six-hourly observations for seven j-ears, is exhibited in the last

column but one of Table YI. Like the diurnal march it is a simple progres-
sion, having one ascending and one descending branch. The least mean
monthly temperature is 71°'95 for July, and the greatest 81°-72 for Januaiy.
From July to January the temperature increases, and from January to July
it decreases. This progression, as is well known, depends on the motion of
the earth in its orbit. The epochs of highest and lowest temperature, how-
ever, do not coincide with those of the sun's highest and lowest meridional

altitudes, but occur at later periods, the maximum temperature about the
4th of February, and the minimum about the 7th of August. The last

column shows the amount of variation, or the excess and defect of the mean
temperature (77°"11) on the monthly means. During the six summer
months the temperatiu'e is above, and dui-ing the si^c winter months below,
the mean temperature, the epochs of which are the 7th of Maj- and the 5th
of November.

   For the sake of comparison, I have given in Table YII. the mean monthly
temperature obtained by taking the mean of the daily readings of the maxi-

mum and minimum thermometers. The mean annual temperature thus

derived is 77°-80, or 0-69 higher than that given by the six-hourly obser-

--vations.
   Temperature in the Sun's Rags. Table YIII. shows the mean monthly
maximum temperature in the sun's rays, obtained by daily observation of a

black bulb thermometer inclosed in an exhausted tube, exposed at an eleva-
tion of 40 feet above the ground, and protected, as far as jiossible, from local
radiation. The results, which, as measures of solar radiation, are, of course,

subject to the usual objections, present a progression similar to that of the

temperature in the shade, the greatest mean monthly maximum being 117°"6

--for January, and the least 101°-2 for July, the progression being harmo-

nious, except that the temperature in February is somewhat lower than in

--March, o-wing probably to the former month being cloudier than the latter.
   E.vtreme Monthly Eange. Table IX. shows the maximum and minimum

temperature and the extreme range of temperature for each month, and
their monthly and yearly means. The greatest range in any one month was
18° in November 1864, and the least 6°-4 in October 1862. The greatest

--fluctuations occur in the warmest months.
   Secular Variation. The last line in Table YI. shows that the tempera-

ture has varied little, it being for foru* years out of the seven almost the same,
and the greatest difference between any two years being only 0°-95.

  A similar remark applies to the numbers in the last line in Table YII.,

showing the mean annual temperature as deiived from the self-registering

thermometers.
                                   ;

ON THE METEOROLOGY OF PORT LOUIS.  Ill

   The last line in Table VIII. shows that the temperature in the sun's rays
was cousiderably greater in 1860 than in any other year, and that, upon the

--whole, it decreased till 1864, and has been increasiag since that year.
   Extreme Annual Range. The extreme annual range of temperature for

each year is given in Table X., containing the highest and lowest readings

of the self-registering thermometers, and the epochs of occui-rence. The
mean annual range is 22°- 52.

                                     II. Elastic Poece op Vapour.

     The pressure of the atmosphere, as measiu-ed by the barometer, is the

 combined pressures of the dry air and the aqueous vapour suspended in it

 and many are of opinion that, by means of simvdtaneous observations of the

 barometer and dry and wet thermometers, the two pressures may be sepa-

--rated and exhibited apart.
     Diurnal Variation. The last line but one in Table XI. gives the diurnal
 march of the vapour-pressiu-e in inches of mercury, as deduced by Glaisher's

 Tables from the six-hourly observations of the dry and wet thermometers.

 "We perceive that the pressure is greatest (-6.58) at the warmest observation

 hour (3| P.M.), and least (-646) at the coldest hour (3| a.m.), which is what
 would be expected, since the' capacity of air for vap'our is directly as the
 temperature. The last line shows the amount of variation, which is shght.

    The last two columns in Table XII. exhibit the mean vapour-pressure for

 each hour of the day, and its deviation from the daily mean, obtained from

the houi-ly term-day observations for four years (1863-66). Here we have
complete evidence of a direct harmony between the diurnal march of the

vapour-pressure and that of the temperature, the hours of the greatest vapour-

Wepressure coinciding with those of the greatest temperature, and vice versa.

see that the march of the vapour-pressure, though a little irregular, is like the
march of the temperature, a single progression, havmg two brauches, the one,
upon the whole, ascending from 4 a.m., when the pressui-e is least (-621), to
1 P.M., when it is greatest (-646), and the other descending from 2 p.m. to
4 A.M. Between 6 and 8 a.m., as the heat increases, the pressure takes a start
upwards, and from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. it is nearly stationary. From 3 to 4 p.m.,
as the heat declines, the vapour-pressru-e also declines, and again continues
nearly uniform till 2 a.m., between Avhich hour and 4 a.m. it falls once more.
From 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. it is above the mean for the day, and from 5 p.m. to

--8 A.M. below it, attaining its mean value about 7 a.m. and 5 p.m.
    Anniwl Variation. The last two cohunns in Table XIII. give the annual
march of the vapour-pressure, and the amount of its deviation from the
annual mean, derived from the six-hourly observations. Here also we have,
upon th^ whole, a single progression. The vapour-pressure attains its maxi-

mum (-767) in February, and its minimum (-550) in July. From February to

July it decreases, and from July to February it increases, except in September,

when it is less than in August,--August, as m'c shall presently see, being a
month in which not only the vapom'-pressure, but also the humidity, rain-

fall, and cloud are greater than in the months immediately preceding and
following it, these elements showing a tendency to a small second maximum.
During the six summer months the vapour-pressure exceeds the mean for
the year (-652), and during the six winter months it falls short of it. There
is thus a connexion between the annual variation of the vapour-pressure
and that of the temperature of a kind similar to that between the diurnal
variations of the same elements, the progressions being in the same dii-ec-
tion, and the turning-points nearly coincident.
112 REPORT--1867.

 --Extreme Monthly Bange. From Table XIY., \rhich gives the maximum

and minimum vapour -pressure and the range for each month, together with

their monthly means, it ·will be seen that the greatest range in any one

month was -384 in March 1864, and the least -149 in May 1863 and Septem-
ber 1864, and that January to May inclusive are the months subject to

--the greatest fluctuation.
   Secular Variation. An examination of the last two lines in Table XIII.

wUl show that, upon the whole, the vapour-pressure has been decreasing since
1860. This becomes more evident when we take the means of the results
for eveiy two consecutive years. The mean pressure for 1866 was "033
below the mean for the seven years, and -061 below the mean for 1860.
Looking at the columns which give the monthly means iu each year, we find
that the greatest mean monthly pressure was '792 in February 1860, and

--the least -498 in July 1866.
   Extreme Annual Bange. Table XV. gives the greatest and least vapour-
pressure and the range for each year, with the dates. The mean annual

range is -494 inch.

                                            in. Humidity.

   The degree of humidity is the ratio of the amount of vapour contained iu
the air to the amount it would contain if saturated with vapour. Hence, if
complete saturation be denoted by 100, and complete dryness by 0, the
degree of humidity at any temperature will be obtained by multiplying the
actual tension of vapour at that temperature by 100, and dividing the
product by the tension required for complete saturation at the same tem-

--perature.
   Diurnal Variation. Table XYI. gives the diurnal variation of the rela-
tive humidity, so far as it can be directly determined by six-hourly observa-

tions. An inspection of the last line but one will show that the humidity is

least (67"3) at the warmest observation hour (3| p.m.), and greatest (73-7)
at the coldest observation hour (3| a.m.), and that at the other hours it has
intermediate values. The mean relative humidity is 70-9, or, complete satu-
ration being 100, nearly 71 hundredths.

   Table XYIII., in which the hourly means of the relative humidity, and
thcii' deviation from the daily mean, are given, as obtained from four years'
term-day observations, shows that the diurnal march, like that of the tem-
perature and vapour-pressure, is a single progression, with two branches
and two turning-jjoints. In this case, however, the march is in a contrary
direction, the greatest humidity occurring at the coldest hours of the day,
and the least at the warmest. Thus, the least humirhty (63-6) occurs at
1 P.M., from which hour till 2 a.m. it increases to 69-9. It then remains
nearly stationary till 8 a.m., showing, however, a tendency to a second
minimum at 4 a.m. From 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. it decreases. From 9 a.m. to
7 P.M. it is below the mean for the day, and during the other hours above

--it, attaining its mean daily value about 9 a.m. and 7 p.m.
    Annual Vanation. The annual march of the relative humidity, and its
variation, are shown in the last two columns of Table XYIII. Here we see
that February is the most humid month, and November the driest, the
mean for the former being 74-7, and for the latter 68-1. From Februaiy
 to June the humidity decreases ; from June to August it increases ; from
 Aug-ust to November it decreases again, and from November to February
increases. There are thus two maxima and two minima, the February
ON THE METEOROLOGY OF PORT LOUIS.  113

maximum, however, being considerably greater than the August maximum,
and the November minimum considerably less than the June minimum.

  We have seen that the diurnal march of the humidity corresponds with

that of the temperature in an inverse sense, the coldest hours being the
moistest, and the warmest hours the driest. Such is not the case with the
annual march, for the most humid months are the warmest. This seems to
arise from the greater length of time that the high temperature prevails in

the one case than in the other. Prom August (which is nearly the coldest

month) to November, the humidity goes on decreasing with an increasing
temperature, the relation between the two elements in their annual march
being here analogous to that between them in their diurnal march ; but it

would appear that by December the vapour has accumulated so much that,

notwithstanding the increasing temperature, the humidity, instead of de-
creasing further, begins to increase, and it goes on increasing till February,

Owing to the excess of accumulated vapour, time is now required to restore

the two elements to their normal relation ; and although the temperature
decreases, the humidity does not increase but decreases, the evaporation from
the surrounding ocean becoming less active ; and it is not till June that the
humidity begins to increase with a decreasing temperature. In August the
temperature commences to rise, and then the humidity decreases with the

increasing temperature till November or December, when the overpowering

effect of evaporation again causes the humidity to increase with the tem-

--perature.
   Extreme Monthly Range. Table XIX. gives the highest and lowest
humidity and the extreme range for each month. The greatest range for
any one month was 38-7 in January 1860, and the least 17"5 in November

1866. January, February, March, and August are the months in which

the greatest fluctuations occur.

  --Secular Variation. The last two lines in Table XYIII. show that 1860

was the most humid year (73-6), and 1866 the driest (66"4) ; and that, upon
the whole, the humidity, Hke the vapour-pressure, has been decreasing since
1860. The most humid month during the seven years was August 1860
(77-8), and the driest November 1866 (57-0), when a severe drought pre-

 vailed.

   Extreme Annual Range.--Tah\e XX. shows the maximum and minimum
relative humidity, the epochs, and range for each year. The mean annual

 range is 41-5.

                                      IV. Atmospheric Pressure.

  --Diurnal Variation. Table XXI. exhibits the mean pressure of the atmo-

 sphere for each of the hours 3| a.m., 9^ a.m., 3| p.m., and 9| p.m. ; and

 whether we regard the monthly results, or the yearly results, for those
 hours, we find two maxima and two minima, the maxima occurring at 9|
 A.M. and p.m., and the minima at 3| a.m. and p.m. From the last hue but

 one it appears that from 3| a.m. to 9^ a.m. the barometer rises from 30-038
 to 30-086 inches, which gives a range of -048 inch; from 9^ a.m. to 3| p.m.
 it falls from 30-086 to 30-015, that is, to the extent of -071 ; from 3^ p.m.
 to 9| P.M. it rises from 30-015 to 30-085, or to the extent of -070 ; and
 from 9^ P.M. to 3i a.m. it falls to the extent of -047.

    But in order to know with certainty whether the march is a double progres-
 sion, and, if so, what are the epochs of the turning-points, we must examine
 the term-day observations. The results of these for four years are pre-
 sented in Table XXII. The last two columns exhibit the mean atmospheric
114 RE PORT 1 867.

pressure for each hour of the day, and its deviation from the mean of all

the observations. Beginning with 9 a.m., we find that for that hour the

mean height of the barometer is 30-090 inches. It then gradually falls to

30-017 at 3 P.M., from which hour it ascends till 10 p.m., when it stands at

30-086. It again gradually falls to 30-037 at 4 a.m., from which hour it

Weagain rises till 9 a.m.  thus see that the diurnal march of the atmo-

spheric pressure is a double progression with four turning-points, namely,

two maxima at 9 a.m. and 10 p.m., and two minima at 4 a.m. and 3 p.m.

This diurnal oscillation of the atmospheric pressure at Mauritius, as at

other tropical stations, is extremely systematic and regidar. Its amount,

and the epochs of its turning-points, vary a little according to the time of

year, as may be seen from the Table ; but, except on very rare occasions, as

on the 13th of January 1863, when the centre of a revolving storm was pas-

sing near the Observatory, it makes its appearance unerringly in aU kinds of

weather. Several theories have been framed with the view of explaining it,

--but none of them has met with entire acceptance.
   Annual Variation. In the last two columns of Table XXIII. we have

the annual march of the atmospheric pressure, and the monthly deviation

Wefrom the mean for the year.       perceive that the mean pressure for

February is 29-843 inches, that from February to August it gradually in-

creases to 30-193, and then gradually decreases till February, and that thus

the progression is single, having one maximum and one minimum. The

annual march of this element, therefore, is in a contrary direction to that of

the temperature, the maximum of the one corresponding nearly, but not

exactly, with the minimum of the other, and vice versa, the turning-points

of the atmospheric pressure occurring later than those of the temperature.

From December to April inclusive, the barometer is below its mean for the

year (30-056), and during the other months above it, the epochs of the mean

--being about the 11th of May and the 9th of November.
   Extreme Monthly Range. Table XXIV. gives the maximum and minimum

pressure and the range for each month, with their means. The greatest range

in any one month was 0-977 inch in February 1861, and the least "170 inch

in December 1860. December, January, February, March, and June are the

months in which the greatest fluctuations occur.

Comparing the mean monthly oscillation of the atmospheric pressure given

in this Table M'ith that of the vapour-pressure in Table XIV., we find that,

if the oscillations of the vapour-pressure aff'ect the barometer to their full

extent, the barometric oscillations depend more upon those of the vapour-

pressure than of the diy pressure.

Secular Variation.^On looking over the last line in Table XXIII., show-

ing the annual means, we find that since 1861 the atmospheric pressure has

been increasing. The lowest annual mean is 30-032 for that year, and the

highest 30-081 for 1864 and 1866, which gives a range of -049 inch, an

amount no doubt mainly due to the disturbing effect of hurricanes. Owing

to the great prevalence of hurricane weather in February 1861, for ex-

ample, the mean for that month (29-665) is less than it would otherwise

--have been, and consequently that for the year.
   Extreme Annual Range. Table XXV. gives the greatest and least pres-

sure, the epochs, and range for each year. The mean annual range is 0-918

inch, while that of the vapour-pressure (Table XV.) is 0-494 inch.

                           V. Pressure of the Dry Air.
The phenomenon of the double maximum and minimum, exhibited by the
ON THE METEOROLOGY OF PORT LOUIS.  115

diurnal march of the total atmospheric pressure, has received from M. Dove,
and, after him, from General Sabine, Sir John Herschel, and others, an ex-

planation founded on the supposed effect of one of the constituents of the total
pressure, namely, the aqueous pressure. Assuming that observations of the
·wet and diy thermometers enable us to detennine the whole pressure of the

vapour in ^the atmosphere, and finding in many instances that when the

vapour-pressure thus obtained is deducted from the total pressure, the march
of the residual dry pressure presents a single progression, having one maxi-

mum and one minimum, corresponding with the coldest and hottest hours,

it has been inferred that the double maximum and minimum of the total

pressure is owing to the march of the vapour-pressure being contrary to
that of the gaseous pressure, au increase of temperatiure causing an increase
of vajjour-pressurc, but a decrease of dry pressure, and vice versa.

    Let us see whether this view will afford an explanation of the double

maximum and minimum of the total pressure at Mauritius.

  --Diurnal Variation. In Table XXXVIII. will be found the total atmo-

spheric pressure, the vapour-pressure, and the dry pressure for each hour,

derived from the term-day observations ; and it will be seen that the diy

pressure does not present a single progression, but, like the total pressure, a

weU-marked double progression, having two maxima at 9 a.si. and 10 p.m.,
and two minima at 3 p.m. and 3 a.m.

   The hourly observations from which these results have been deduced were
not numerous, but there is little doubt that more extensive observation
would have led to the same conclusion ; for the six-hoirrly observations,

extending over a period of seven years, also give a double maximum and

minimi;m for the dry pressure, as wiU appear from an inspection of Table

XXXYII., which shows that the dry pressure has a maximum at 9| a.m.
and P.M., and a minimum at 3| a.m. and p.m., just like the total pressure.

   We are thus led to conclude that, if the observations of the dry and wet

thermometers afford the means of determining the vapour-pressure, the

gaseous pressure at Mauritius has a progression in every respect similar to

that of the total atmospheric pressure, and therefore that the phenomenon

in question cannot be accoimted for by the dii-ect action of the vapour-

pressure.

A- similar progi-ession of the dry pressure at Bombay has been referred to

the relations which arise from the juxtaposition of land and sea, causing
land and sea bi'eezes. At Mauritius, surrounded on all sides by the Indian

Ocean, the double progression of the dry pressure occurs in aU kinds of

weather, and from whatever quarter the wind may come, and is most marked
on those days when the trade-wind blows steadily; and hence it is presu-

--mable that it occurs at sea, away from the influence of land.
   Annual Variation. At many extratrojncal stations, the annual variation
of the total pressure shows little trace of periodicity, but when the vapour-

pressure is deducted, the dry pressure is found to have a progression in

inverse harmony with that of the temperature. On examining Table
XXXIX., it will be seen that at Mauritius the annual march of the dry

pressiire is exactly like that of the total pressure, and that both have appa-
rently the same relation to the temperature.

                        VI. DlEECTION AKD VeERING OF THE WiND.

   Table XXVI. shows the number of times the wind blew from the principal

points of the compass. The observations were taken fom- times a day during
116 REPORT--1867.

five years, and their number therefore was 7300, of which 1076 were for
calms, and 98 for variables, leaving 6126 for the direction of the wind. The
distribution of this latter number for the foiu- quarters of the horizon was as
follows : from north to east (not including east) 683, from east to south (not
including south) 47-40, from south to west (not including west) 158, and

--from west to north (not includiag north) 515, showing that the number of

times the wind came from the points between east and south was nearly four
times as great as the number of times it came from the remaining thi-ee
quarters together. From east to S.E. inclusive, the number of observations
was 4286, which is more than two-thirds of the total number of observations.
This shows the great preponderance of the trade-wind, which prevails

throughout the whole year, but is strongest and steadiest from May to No-

vember, and more especially in June, July, and August.
   The wind veers almost always with the sun, or from S.E. through east to

north, IST.W., &c., decreasing in force as it veers. It often remains steady at

E.S.E. for a week or ten days. After it passes N.E., calms and variables
with light north-westerly and westerly breezes, and close sultry weather pre-

Avail for two or three days. The trade-wind then reappears at S.S.E. similar

revolution sometimes takes place in the course of a day. The wind seldom

veers in the opposite direction ; but it always does so during the passage of a
revolving storm on the east side of the island.

                       VII. EORCE OF THE WlND.

 --Diurnal Variation. As Osier's anemometer is not affected by light breezes,

the force of the wind at the observation hours has usually been estimated.
Table XXVII. gives the mean estimated force derived from the six-hourly
observations. The results are but approximations; for, independently of

other sources of error, the site of the Observatory is not favourable for de-
termining the true force and direction of the wind, even with the most ap-

proved instruments. StiLL, the observations indicate that the force varies

directly as the temperature, the greatest pressure occurring at the waiTuest

hours.

   The last column in Table XXXVIII. gives the mean estimated force for

each hour derived from the term-day observations. Here Ukevnse, notwith-
standing the fewness of the observations, we see a general agreement between
the variations of the force of the wind and the temperature.

  --Annual Variation. Table XXVIII. gives the mean estimated force. Ja-

nuary, February, and March are the months in which the wind is strongest
at the observation hours, and next to them June, Jul}', and August. In the
former months huj-ricancs occur, and in the latter the S.E. trade-wind blows

in full force. From February to May the -wind decreases ; in June, July, and

August it is high ; from August to November it decreases, and from Novem-
ber to February it increases. There is thus an indication of a double pro-

--gression.
   Mean Monthly Maximum Force. Table XXIX. shows the mean maximum

force of the wind for each month, as recorded by Osier's anemometer, with-

Weout regard to the hour of the day.  find that, notwithstanding the severe

hurricanes which occasionally occur in the summer months, the mean maxi-

mum force of the wind is greater for June, July, and August than for any

Weother three months.  perceive also that this Table, like the former, points

to a double maximum and minimum. From November to February the wind

increases with an tacreasiag temperature, and from February to April it de-
                                   --

creases with a decreasing temperature. But from April to June it again in-
creases with a decreasing temperature, and stands high in the latter month,
and in July and August, owiog probably to the high temperature in the
northern hemisphere causing an influx of air (S.W. monsoon) towards the
heated regions, and thus exciting the S.E. trade-wind in the southern hemi-

--sphere. From August to November the mean maximum force decreases.
   Secular Variation. The last Unes in Tables XXVIII. and XXIX. show

that 1860, 1861, and 1863 were the years in which the force of the wind
was greatest, and we shall presently see that these were the years in which
hurricanes were most frequent and violent. The years 1862 and 1864 were
remarkable for an absence of hurricanes, and these were the years in which

--the mean force of the wind was least.
   Extreme Annual Force. Table XXX. shows the greatest force of the wind,

and the epoch, for each year.

                                                  VIII. Cloud.

   Tables XXXI. and XXXII. exhibit the mean amount of cloud for each of

the four daily observation hours, each month and each year. The nights
and mornings are comparatively cloudless. Towards 10 a.m. the clouds be-
gin to gather, by 2 p.m. the sky is often overcast, and in the evening the
weather usually clears up. The mean amount of cloud for the year is
47, 100 denoting completely overcast. February is the cloudiest and June
the least cloudy month, the means being 59 and 40 respectively. The last
column in Table XXXII. points to a connexion between the amount of cloud
and the temperature. From Jfovember to February the amount of cloud in-
creases, and fi'om February to June it decreases. From June to November,

however, there is a tendency to a second progression.

                                               IX. Eainpail.

   Table XXXIII. gives the amount of rainfall for each month and year.
The greatest fall ia any one month during the seven years was 46'57 inches in
February 1861. In September 1861 and November 1866 thei'e was no
ramfaU sufficient to affect the gauge. The greatest mean monthly fall is
14-23 inches for February, and the least 0-39 inch for September. From

September to February the rainfall increases ; from February to June it de-
creases; from June to August it increases again, and then falls in September,
showing, upon the whole, a double progi'ession, having its maxima in Febru-
ary and August, and its minima in June and September. The mean annual
fall is 37'87 inches, and the mean monthly fall 3-16 inches. The greatest fall
in any one year was 68-76 inches in 1861, and the least 20-56 inches in 1866.
The principal rain-bearing wind is the trade-wind from E.S.E. to E.N.E.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

but at times, during the summer months, torrents of rain descend with north-
erly and north-westerly winds, and on those occasions the mountains become
enveloped in dense mist. The greatest rainfall on any one day, in each year,

with the date, is shown in Table XXXIV.

    There is reason to fear that the rainfall is decreasing : the fall during the
first three years was considerably greater than that during the last four years
of the period of seven years.

   In some parts of the island the rainfall is much greater than at Port Louis,
as will be seen from Table XXXV., showing the rainfall at nineteen stations
for periods ranging from two to five years. Of these stations, Gros Cailloux
and Port Louis, both on the coast, and not many feet above the sea-level, are
118 REPORT--1867.

the furthest west, and it is at them that the rainfall is least, the mean annual
amount for five years being 28-03 inches at the former, and 30-24 inches at
the latter station. Mont Choisy is also on the west coast near the northern

extremity of the island, but further east than Gros Cailloux and Port Louis,

and at it the mean annual fall for the same period was 51-54 inches. Some
miles south-eastward of Mont Choisy, further from the coast, and at elevations
of 200 to 600 feet, are four other stations, namely, Les Eochers, Labourdon-
nais, the Botanical Gardens, and Lucia; and, with the exception of Les
Rochers, where the mean annual fall was 50-10 inches, the rainfall at each
of these stations was considerably greater than at Mont Choisy, having been

63-62 inches at Laboiirdonnais, and 67-98 inches at Lucia; while at the

Botanical Gardens, in 1864 and 1865, it was also greater than at Mont Choisy.
It should here be remarked that Lucia, the station at which the greatest

rainfall occurs in that part of the island, lies south-eastward of the other

stations, and at a higher elevation. About fourteen miles due north of Lucia
is a small island, called Flat Island, about five miles from the mainland.
Observations on the rainfall were taken there in 1862 and 1863, and it wiU
be seen that the amounts for those years were 28-02 and 36-54 inches, re-
spectively, or nearly the same as at Port Louis. About seven miles S.S.W.
of Lucia, and at the same distance E.S.E. of Port Louis, is Esperance, on the
central tableland, at an elevation of about 1400 feet. Here, in 1865, the
rainfall was 147-74 inches against 101-56 at Lucia, 44-73 at Port Louis,
and 36-57 at Gros Cailloux. Westward and south-westward of Esperance, at
distances of five to eleven miles, and at elevations of 900 to 1300 feet, are five
stations more, namely, Croft-an-Eigh, Beau Sejour, Trianon, the Braes, and
Mesnil, at each of which the rainfall, though more than double what it is at
Port Louis, is considerably less than at Esperance. At a distance of about
eight miles east of Esperance, and about four miles from the east coast, is
La Gaite. Here the rainfall is also less than at Esperance, but greater than
at the stations westward and south-westward of it (except Mesnil, the highest
of them), although these are more elevated than La Gaite. But the rainiest
station of all is Cluny, which lies about eleven miles south of Esperance, and
sixteen miles S.E. of Port Louis, at a height of about 900 feet above the sea,
and nearly surrounded by mountains and forests. At this station, in 1865,
the rainfall was 192-45 inches, and the mean fall for five years was 142-80
inches. Southward and south-eastward of Cluny, nearer the coast, and at
lower elevations, are three more stations, namely, Gros Bois, Beau Vallon, and
St. Aubin, at each of which the rainfall is also very considerable, having, in
1865, been 135-21, 100-85, and 115-61 inches, respectively.

    These observations illustrate the influence of local circumstances, as eleva-
tion, direction of wiud, mountain, and forest on the rainfall of a place. Thus,
at La Gaite, near the east coast, the rainfall (in 1865) was 97-55 inches ; at

Esperance, nearly due west, but at a much higher elevation, it was 147*74

inches ; at Croft-au-Eigh, westward of Esperance, and at a lower level
than it, but at a considerably higher level than La Gaite, the rainfall was
79-44 inches ; and at Gros Cailloux, west of Croft-an-Eigh, on the west coast,

it was only 36-57 inches, or not much more than one-third the rainfall at
La Gaite on the east coast. These stations arc situated nearly in a line and
in the dii'ection of the prevaihng wind ; and the greater fall at Espe'rance
than at La Gaite is probably due to the higher elevation and lower tempera-
ture of the former ; while the greater faU at La Gaite than at Croft-an-Eigh,

though the latter stands at a higher level, seems to be due to the situation

of La Gaite on that side of the island on which the vaporu" first impinges
ON THE METEOROLOGY OF PORT LOUIS.  119

as it comes up from the sea. Comparing tlie rainfall at Beau Vallon, Cluny,
Beau Sejour, and Gros Cailloux, which lie nearly in a S.E. and N."W. direc-

tion, we find similar relations.
   For some years past many parts of the island, particularly on the western

and northern coasts, have been suffering from drought ; the rivers have been
gradually diminishing, and the lakes and marshes in the interior been drying

Up. As we have already seen, last year (1866) has been the driest of all,

the rainfall ia some places having been little more than half the average fall.
The consequence is that this year's crop wiU be very much reduced.

   The evil which is thus pressing on the colony is generally attributed to
the extensive clearings which have been carried on in all directions during
the last fifteen years. The primeval forests with which this little island was
at one time clothed have to a great extent been replaced by the sugar-cane,
and now the cauo languishes and dies for want of moisture. It would be

satisfactory to those interested in the welfare of Mauritius to have the

opinions of men of science as to the probable effect of the destruction of
forests on the rainfall and humidity, and I am glad of having an opportunity

of bringing the subject before the Association. Given a small mountainous
island in the trade-wind region, covered with dense forests, and surrounded
by a tropical sea : what eflfect, if any, with respect to rainfall and humidity,
would be produced by stripping that island of its forests, and exposing

soil and rocks to the sun's rays ? It seems to me that, whether the annual

rainfall would diminish or not, the air would become drier, as the greater
portion of the rains would be speedily carried away to the sea, and the re-
maining portion speedily evaporated. This last year, however, shows a very
marked decrease of rain, and if the previous six years do not so to the same

--extent, they show a tendency to a recurrence of floods and droughts that

is, to a disturbance in the distribution of the rainfall. The humidity of the
air also has, as we have seen, been upon the whole decreasing at Port Louis
since 1860. In that year it was 73-6, while in 1866 it was only 66-4.

                                 X. Thunder and Lightnikg.

   Table XXXVI. shows that in the course of the seven years no lightning was
seen between May and November, except on one day in August 1864. Ja-

nuary, March, February, and April are the months in which thunder-storms
prevail ; they generally occur in the afternoon, but occasionally at other
periods of the day, or iu the night. Some are local, and others travel over a

considerable extent of ocean. The average number of days per annum on
which lightning was visible is 26-4. The greatest number of days in any one
year on which lightning was observed was 40 iu 1863, and the least 19 in

1862.

                                    XI. Gales and Httreicanes.

   Mauritius, as is well known, is subject to hurricanes. The hurricane
months are December to April inclusive, but more especially January, Feb-
ruary, and March, particularly February. Strong gales occur also in June,
July, and August. I will present a few of the leading facts connected with

--the gales and hurricanes which took jAace during the period under review.
   1860. Four gales occurred in 1860. The first took place between the
11th and 17th of January. The barometer fell to 29'6S0 inches. The vidnd

veered from S.E. to S., S.W., and W., and attained a maximum pressure

of 10 lbs. on the square foot. The rainfall was 7 inches. This was a
120 REPORT-- 1867.

great revolving storm, the centre of wMeh passed on the east side of the

island, at a nearest distance of 129 miles.
   Another gale took place between the 22ud and 27th of February. The ba-

rometer fell to 29-660. On this occasion the wind veered from S.E. to E.,
N., and N.W., and had a maximum force of 9 lbs. The rainfall was 7-455
inches. This was another revolving storm, which, as shown by the veering
of the wind, passed the island on its north and west sides. The nearest

distance of the centre was 220 miles.
   The nest gale occurred between the 18th and 27th of March. The lowest

reading of the barometer was 29-464. The wind veered from S.E. to S.,

S.W., W., and N.W., and exerted a maximum force of 13 lbs. on the square

foot. The rainfall was 4-075 inches. This was another revolving storm,
which, Kke the fii'st, passed on the east and south sides of the island. The

nearest distance of the centre was 170 miles.

  A fourth gale took jJace on the 21st of June, with the barometer standing

at 30-252 to 30-314. The wind was from south to S.S.E., and blew with a

maximum force of 18 lbs. There was no rain. This was not a revolving

storm, but one of the -winter gales, in which the wind veers very little, and
which are apparently the immediate effect of the trade-wind being put in
violent motion by the same causes that produce the S.W. monsoon of the

--Bay of Bengal, which the S.E. trade-wind supplies with air.
    1861. In Eebruaiy 1861 a hurricane occurred which lasted six days,
namely, from the 11th to the 17th. It was a revolving one. For three
days it remained nearly stationary, its centre bearing about 110 miles N.N.E.
of the Observatory. The wind blew in fearful gusts, attended -with torrents
of rain, from S.S.E. to E.S.E., for &\e days, and then veered to E., N.E.,

N.W., andW. The barometer fell to 29-009 on the mornrag of the 16th,
the centre of the storm at that time bearing N.W. 50 miles, which was its

nearest distance. In the night of the 13th, the vane of Osier's anemometer
was blown away, the pressure being then about 30 lbs. ; the greatest pres-

sure afterwards cannot have been less than 40 lbs. From 9| a.m. on the

11th to 9| A.M. on the 17th, 44-730 inches of rain fell at the Observatory,
and at Yacoas, 13 miles to the southward, at an elevation of 1200 feet, 99
inches feU in the same time. The centre of the storm passed between

Mauritius and the neighbouring island of Reunion.
    Another severe hurricane took place from the 7th to the 16th of February,

in the space between 10° and 20° S. and 76° and 84° E. ; so that two hurri-

canes raged at the same time.

   A third severe hm-ricanc, but of much shorter duration, took place on the

2nd and 3rd of March. The wind veered from S.E. to S., S.W., and W.,

and blew with a maximum force of about 36 lbs. The barometer fell to

29-282, the centre of the storm, which was a rotatory one, being then 140
miles E.S.E. of the Observatory. This hurricane passed on the east side of

--the island.
    1862. This was comparatively a tranquil year at Mauritius, only two gales
having occurred, neither of which was violent. The first took place on the

26th of February. The wind was from S.S.E. to E., and attained a maximum

force of 12-50 lbs. The barometer fell to 29-888. The weather at Port
Louis, except on the 26th, when it was overcast and showery, was fine ; but
away to the north-eastward, between 8° to 16° S. and 60° to 110° E., the
S.E. trade-wind and IS^.W. monsoon wore in stormy collision, and two severe
hurricanes were encountered in that locality, both raging on the same days.

    The next gale in the course of this year was experienced on the 1st and
       ON THE METEOROLOGY OF PORT LOUIS.                                                                                                          121

2nd of December. The wind veered from S.E. to S., S.W., and W., and

its maximum force was 9-50 lbs. The rainfall was only 0-430 inch. The

barometer fell to 29-666. This was a small revolving storm, which passed

--on the east side of the island. Its nearest distance was 150 miles.
   1863. Several hurricanes occurred iu 1863. The first took place on the

13th of January. The wind veered from E. b. S. K,to jST.E., N.W., W.,
and W.S.W., and its maximum force was 17 lbs. The rainfall, from 9§ a.m.

on the 11th to 9^ a.m. on the 14th, was 7-22-5 inches. This was a rogatory
storm, which came down from the north-westward, and the centre of which

passed over the S.W. extremity of the island. The barometer fell to 29-332.

  A second gale took place between the 31st of January and the 4th of Feb-

ruary. The wind veered from E.S.E. to N.E., N., and IST.W., and attained a
force of 12 lbs. The barometer fell to 29-700. The rainfall was 1-681 inch.

This was another revolving storm, which passed about 50 miles west of Re'-

union, and caused great loss in that island.

  A third revolving storm passed on the northward and north-westward of

the island between the 9th and 13th of February. Its nearest distance was
200 miles. The barometer at the Observatory feU to 29-816. The wind

veered from S.E. to E. and N.E., and attained a force of 14 lbs. The rain-
fall was 3-192 inches.

Between the 18th and 22nd of February a fourth rotatory storm of great

violence passed on the north and west of the island, the wind veering from

S.E. to E. and N.N.E., and attaining a maximum force of 36 lbs. The

nearest distance of the centre was 50 miles. The barometer fell to 29-438.

--The rainfall was 2-430 inches.
   1864. The year 1864 was remarkable for an absence of hurricanes. The

strongest gale took place on the 2nd of July, with the barometer at 30-209.

The wind blew from S.E. to E., with a maximum force of 8-7 lbs. Scarcely

--any rain fell.
   1865. This year was also characterised by an absence of hurricanes.

One or two gales, however, occurred in February. On the 12th of that

month the wind, which had been previously veering from S.E. to E., sud-

denly increased from N.E. by E., and attained a force of 7-5 lbs. at 3-15 p.m.,

and then died away to hght airs tiU midnight, when it increased to a force of

3 lbs. from N.W. When the wind came round to 1!^. and N.W., the moun-

tains became speedily enveloped in dense masses of vapour down to theii-
bases, and between 7 and 9 p.m., during a thunder-storm, rain fell in torrents.
The streams rose rapidly ; bridges and causeways were swept away, stores
inundated, and several lives lost. The rainfall at Port Louis in 24 hours was

7-460 inches, the greater portion of which fell between 6 and 9 p.m. ; but at
La Gaite it was 18-307 inches, and at Croft-an-Eigh 14-65 inches. The baro-
meter fell to 29-507. There was no revolving storm in the neighbourhood of

the  island on this occasion                                                                              but the IST.W.  monsoon advanced to  the south-
                                                                                                       ;

ward, and heavy rains, accompanied with strong winds, thunder, and light-

ning, fell in the localities where it came into collision with the S.E. trade-
wind.

   The strongest gale during this year took place between the 19th and 22nd

of February. The wind remained at S.S.E. to E.S.E., and its maximum force

was 13-5 lbs. The rainfall was only 0-665 inch. The barometer fell to
29-730. On this occasion two or three revolving storms occurred at some

distance to the northward and north-eastward of the island, between the

--confines of the N.W. monsoon and S.E. trade-wind.
   1866. The strongest gale in the course of this year took place between

1867.                                                                                                                                          K
                                                                             ;

122 REPORT--1867.

the 13th and 20th of April. The wind remained at S.E. to E.S.E. and E.
throughout, and in the gusts blew with a force varying from 1 to 13'5 lbs on
the square foot. The barometer ranged from 30"174 to 29-944, and oscillated

during the gusts. Very little rain fell. On the 21st the wind veered to the

north of east and fell light. It was afterwards ascertained that several re-
volving storms occui'red from the 6th to the 25th of April, between the inner
borders of the monsoon and trade-wind, away to the northward and north-
eastward of Mauritius.

    This is not the time to enter into a discussion regarding the nature and
origin of these storms : I wiU only remark that, by watching the barometer,

the wind, and the clouds, their existence and approach may be known with
certainty, even when the distance is very considerable.

                             XII. Synopsis of Eestjlts.

With a view of facilitating a comparison of the results, I have prejoared

a few Tables in which the diurnal, monthly, and annual means of the prin-

cijial elements are placed side by side.

 --Diurnal Variation.- Table XXXVII. exhibits the means for each observa-

tion horn' of the six-hourly series, derived from seven years' observation

and Table XXXVIII. those for each hour of the day, derived from term-day

observations taken for foiu* years. As akeady remarked, the diurnal march

of the temperature, vapour-pressure, force of wind, and amount of cloud are

all more or less accordant, being in the same sense, and having the turniug-

points nearly at the same hours. The diurnal march of the humidity is in a

contrary sense, but the turning-points are nearly coincident with those of

the temperature. With regard to the total atmospheric pressui'e, and the

pressure of the dry aii', they have a double progression, with four turning-

points.

 --Amiual Variation. Table XXXIX. exhibits the monthly means. The

temperature in the shade and in the sun's rays decreases from January to

July, and then increases from July to January. The atmospheric pressure

increases from February to August, and then decreases from August to Feb-

ruary                        and the march of the dry pressure  is similar.  The vapour-pressure
                          ;

has a progression in direct agreement with that of the temperature, showing,

however, a tendency to a second maximum in August. With respect to the hu-

midity, we see that it has a double progression, with two maxima in February

and August, and two minima in June and November. The mean monthly

force of the wind also has, upon the whole, a double i)rogression, having
two maxima in February and June, and two minima in April and November.
The rainfoU, too, has a double progression, with two maxima in February

and August, and two minima in June and September. The amount of cloud

has a maximum in February and a minimum in June, with a tendency to a

second maximum in August. A similar remark applies to the frequency of

lightning.

Table XL. gives the means of the extreme monthly range of the principal

elements. The temperature and humidity are, on the whole, subject to greater
fluctuations in the summer than in the winter months, and the greatest fluc-

tuations of the vajiour-pressure take place from January to June inclusive.

A comparison of the oscillations of the total atmospheric pressure and va-

--pour-pressure will show the important part played by the latter.
   Secular Variation. Table XLI. exhibits the extreme annual range, and

Table XLII. the annual means of the several elements for each year.
         ON THE METEOROLOGY OF FORT LOUIS.                             123

    As might be expected of an island exposed to the bracing S.E. trade-
wind, having a mean annual tempei'atiu-c of 07° to 77° (the temperature in
the interior is from 4° to 10° loAver than at Port Louis), and a mean humi-
dity of 71, clothed with vegetation, and subject to so small variations of
temperature and humidity, Mauritius possesses one of the best tropical cli-
mates in the world. At one time it was a sanatoiium for invalids from
India in search of health ; and if, of late, it has been the scene of di-ead-

ful mortality, this is not to be ascribed to an unbountiful Nature, but, there
is reason to fear, to a neglect and violation of her laws.

    I mentioned at the outset that the site of the Observatory was objection-
able. In conclusion I beg to state, that a new Observatory is about to be
erected in a more favourable locality. The old Observatory and grounds
have been sold for ,£10,000, and the local government have voted a portion
of that sum for the erection of a new Observatory, which is to be supplied
with self-recording meteorological and magnetical instruments. Plans of

the buildings have been prepared at the request of the Secretary of State
for the Colonies ; and although Mauritius has lately been sorely tried,
it is expected that the buildings will soon be commenced. The Governor,

Sir Henry Barkly, who has done so much for science in other colonies,
is a warm promoter of the measure, and His Excellency's influential endea-
voiu's are seconded by the principal Government officials and the leading
planters and merchants. Nor can I close this communication Avithout making

mention with becoming respect of the efforts and recommendations of Gene-
ral Sabine, who, for a number of years, has lost no opportunity of urging the
importance of Mauritius as a meteorological and magnetical station, and is

still pleased to take much interest in the subject.

ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE HIGHLAND RAILWAY.  151

 On the Construction and Works of the Highland Railway. By Joseph
    Mitchell^ F.R.S.E., F.G.S., C.E., and Member of the Institution

     of Civil Engineers.

 This title represents the iinion of several Coropanies in the north of

 Scotland, amalgamated three years ago under the name of the Highland
 Eailway Company. The works consist of a main line from a point near
 Perth, extending northward 117 miles to the town of Forres, and a base-

 line running nearly at right angles to the other, extending westwards from
 the town of Keith by Elgin and Forres along the shores of the Moray Firth
 to Inverness, and thence along the Beauly, Dingwall, and Dornoch Firths,
 northwards to Bonar Bridge, measuring from Keith to Inverness 55 miles,
 and from Inverness to Bonar Bridge 58 miles, and making together a base-
 line of 113 miles. These railways traverse the northern part of Perthshire,
 and are the main lines of communication through part of Banffshire and

 the counties of Inverness, Nairn, Moray, and Koss, the whole including three

--branches two to the ports of Burghead and Findhorn in Morayshire, and the

--other to the village of Aberieldy in Perthshii-e and extending to 24G miles

length.

    The countiy is fertile and comparatively flat for a distance of about 40
mUes north of Perth, and also along the shores of the Moray, Dingwall, and
Dornoch Firths ; but between Perthshire and Morayshire the line crosses two
ranges of the Grampian Mountains, the one separating the vaUey of the Tay

from that of the Spcy, and the northern range separating the Spey from the

valley of the Findhorn.

    The large rivers which chain these mountain -regions debouch into the Tay,
the Moray, the Dingwall, and the Dornoch Firths, and as the railway in
most cases crosses these rivers near the sea, bridges of considerable magnitude

Avere required. Besides the crossing of these rivers, other difficulties of a
formidable character arose in crossing the mountains at so great an eleva-

tion, and in passing the rocky and precipitous defiles through which portions
of the line had to run.

    The northern counties traversed by these railways, except along the shores of
the Firths, are chiefly pastoral, exporting large numbers of sheep and cattle^

    The fisheries also are on an extensive scale ; besides the salmon fisheries
in the rivers, the annual take of white fish in the Moray Firth amounts to
about 60,000 tons.

    The object of the promoters, therefore, was to sweep the fertile shores of
the Moray Firth, ancl to send the produce of the country by the most direct
route to Perth, across the mountains, thus saving a detour by Aberdeen of
nearly 60 miles. In laying out the main line and crossing the Grampians
between Perth and Forres, long and steep inclines could not be avoided, but
there is no steeper gradient than 1 in 70 throughout. The line to Blair,
36 miles fi-om Perth, rises only 443 feet above the level of the sea, but from
Blair to the summit of the southern range of the Grampians, a distance of 17
miles, the line rises 1045 feet, making the extreme summit 1488 feet above
the sea. In this distance there are gradients for 10 continuous miles of 1
in 72 and 1 in 70, and in the remainiag 7 miles the inclines vary from 1 in
78 to 1 in 110. After passing this summit the line descends into the vaUey
of the Spey, falling 747 feet in 18 miles, the steepest gradient being 1 in 80.

On crossing the Spey, the line is comparatively level for a distance of 24 miles,
when it again ascends by gradients of 1 in 84, 80, and 100, in order to pass

the northern ridge which separates the vaUey of the Spey from that of the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;;

Findhom. This summit is 1046 feet above the sea-level. It afterwards de-
scends to Forres (the point of junction with the base-line) by gradients, the
steepest of which are 1 in 70 ibr S miles, and 1 in 70 for 4 miles.

   In this length of the main direct line of 104 miles, there are two small
tunnels, one of 350 yards near Dunkeld, and the other in the Pass of Killie-
crankie of 110 j-ards in length, both constructed very much with the view of

avoiding injury to the adjoining scenery.

   The principal difficulties that arose in laying out the line were in passing
through the narrow defile at Dunkeld, the beautiful demesne of the Duke of
Athole, and again in penetrating through the picturesque Pass of KiUiecrankie,
where the mountains, as it were, close in upon each other for a great height
likewise in passing along the narrow, precipitous, and rocky valley of
the Garry, close to a large and rapid mountain-stream ; also the Park at
Castle Grant, and the defile at Huntley's Cave near Grantown. These
points in particular required much study, with repeated trial and contour

levels, so as to obtain a kno-wledge of the precise formation of the ground,

and to choose the best direction at the lowest possible cost. At the Pass of
KiUiecrankie the banks were so precipitous and steep that the line had to be
supported by breast or retaining walls to the extent of 690 lineal yards, and
to the average height of 26 feet, the extreme height of one being 55 feet
and in order to carry the railway at the narrowest point in the Pass where
the precipices close in, as it were, on either side, and afford scarcely any ad-
ditional space beyond that occupied by the channel of the river, instead of
supporting the line by brcastwaUs, it was deemed prudent to construct a
viaduct of 10 arches, 60 feet above the river, which with a tunnel at the
north end carries it successively through the Pass. At two other points on
the line, in running up the sides of the Garry, brcastwaUs had to be formed,
respectively 94 and 35 yards in length, and 15 feet in average height. All
these breastwalls, extending to 1650 lineal yards, are buUt with Ume, and
set on a solid foundation of dry gravel or rock, at right angles to the face of
the waU, which batters at the rate of 1| inch to the foot.

    The spaces behind the waUs are fiUed with rubble stones, set by hand for
10 feet wide, and further back with dry gravel, it being important that aU
earth or clayey substances should be excluded. The writer prefers the curved
to the straight batter, as it gives more effectual resistance if well built ; but
breastwalls are to be avoided wherever earth embankments can be substi-

tuted, as, in his experience, there are subtle influences in the Scottish climate

of alternate frost and wet in winter, which operate imperceptibly to their
destruction, and they require careful and constant inspection. Except where
those breastwaUs became necessary, the whole of the lines were formed in
cuttings and embankments, and for considerable distances along the slopes of

vaUeys. Where the ground was precipitous or irregular in the cross

section, level benchings were formed, 10 feet in width, immediately under-
neath the pei-manent way, in order that the sleepers should have an equal
and solid bearing throughout.

    In rimning through so large an extent of mountainous country, the line,
 as might be expected, had to pass over some lengths of soft ground and
morass. The piincipal of these were for two mUes near the town of Nairn,
 also for about two miles near Keith, one mile on Dava Moor, and about a

mile in crossing through a hoUow at Drumochter on the summit of the
 Grampians. In aU places where the ground was particularly soft, a uniform
mode of treatment was adopted. Two par;iUel drains were first cut outside

 the fences, about 50 feet apart, from 4 to 6 feet deep, and with slopes of 1
                                                        ;

to 1. This drained off the surface-water; and, after making up the holes
and other irregularities of the surface with turf, the space for the railway to a
breadth of about 15 feet was covered with two or three layers of swarded
or heather tuif, having the sward side of the lower layer undermost, and
that of the top layer up, the joints breaking band. In this way a good sus-

taining surface has uniformly been obtained*. On this bed of turf the

ballast was laid for 2 or 3 feet in depth. This was quite sufficient to support
the traffic, but as in some cases the bed of moss was from 20 to 30 feet in
depth, the railway merely floated on the surface, and was in the first instance
undulating, and yielded in some parts from 3 to 4 inches under the weight
of the engines passing over. To obviate this undulation longitudinal beams
of timber were tried at one place, 30 to 40 feet long, below the sleepers, but
this was found objectionable, as rendering it more difficult to raise or repair
the surface of the road ; and an additional sleeper (making the sleepers 2
feet 6 inches from centre to centre, instead of 3 feet) was found preferable.
There was nothing for it, at the worst, but to hft the road every other week

as it sunk, until it had acquired a soUd bearing. In many places we had to

lay on 4, 5, or 6 feet in depth of additional gravel, and in one place no less
than 27 feet, before the road became solid. In the course of two or three

years, however, with due attention, the rails being fished, the lines through
these mosses were aU that could be desired for solidity and permanence.

   As the writer has said, in crossing so many mountain-rivers, bridges of

magnitude had to be constructed, involving considerable varieties of execution.

The principal of these bridges may now be described, and any peculiarity
will be noticed which may have arisen during the progress of the works. It

will be observed that the beds of the rivers in the north of Scotland differ in

many respects from what is common in England, consisting frequently of

depths of 10 or 12 feet of gravel and boulders, the solid and compacted debris

of successive floods, below which, if the country is of rocky formation, there
is usually hard clay, and then rock, or, as in one case at the mouth of the
River Ness, after penetrating 12 feet of shingle and boulders, a sort of ad-

mixtui'e of whitish clay and sand was obtained. In some cases we had to
deal with soft clay and mud of great depth, but these were exceptions. Nor

was it possible in general to ascertain, by boring, the precise nature of the
foundations, because many bf the boulders in the gravel were of large size,

and were often mistaken for rock. The only way in which an approximate

knowledge of the foundations could be obtained was by driving ii-on rods at
various places, and, when the bed of the river admitted of it, wooden piles.

StUl we worked very much in the dark ; but the writer's long experience of

these rivers, and of the natiu-e of their floods, was of great advantage in
enabling him to fix the depth of the foundations and the precise description
of works, to secure the necessary stability of construction. In only two or

three cases was there any fear of sinking. What had chiefly to be guarded

against was sudden and impetuous floods, sometimes accompanied with
floating ice and trees, undermining the foundations and damaging the piers
it was therefore important to provide ample waterway. The construction of
these bridges ranged over twelve years, and during that time there has been
considerable changes in bridge building, by the adoption of iron cylinders for
piers, and lattice girders in spanning the waterways, so that, as the works
progressed, these improvements were adopted where found suitable.

* Had this plan, whicli the writer has found to answer so well both for roads and

railways, been adopted in the clayey ground at Balaklava in the Crimea, a good road might
hare been formed.

   In planning these works, the writer, while having every regard to economy,
felt the importance of their being of the most substantial character, seeing

that they were exposed in these districts to every vicissitude of climate and
flood ; but indeed he feels that aU permanent public works involving the

safety of the lives of the community should be of undoubted stability. On

the whole system there are only three timber bridges, which he was forced
to adopt, chiefly with a view to save time, but these are very substantial of
their kind. All the other bridges are constructed of stone, and where iron
is adopted the piers are in general constructed of masonry.

   The iron work of the bridges on all these lines were constructed by Messrs.
Fairbairn and Sons of Manchester, for about ,£20 per ton on the average,
and are admirable specimens of workmanship in this department.

    Accompanying this paper, the writer furnished the working drawings of
fourteen of these bridges, with the sections and dimensions in detail. They
exhibit a variety of forms suited to the localities in which they are built.

    No. 1 is an iron-girder bridge across the Tay, 6 miles north of Dunkeld,
with stone abutments and pier, constructed on platforms and piles in the
usual way. The banks are low, and the river is spanned by two openings,
one of 210 feet, and the other of 141 feet. The cost of this work was
£20,395. Extreme length 515 feet; height above the bed of the river

67 feet ; cost per lineal foot £39 12s.
    Nos. 2 and 3 are the most recent bridges erected by the writer ; and here

he has taken advantage of the modern plan of using cylinder piers to carry
the girders. Both bridges are constructed in the same manner, and on the
same principle. The cyhnders form the piers in the centre and abutments.
Each cylinder is 8 feet in diameter, and has been sunk into the bed of the

river 27| feet in their extreme depth, by means of divers. When these cy-

linders were adjusted and brought to the full depth, about 3 feet of cement

concrete was lowered into the Taottom. On the concrete setting, the water
was pumped out, and the interior fiUed in vrith rubble masonry, laid with

Portland cement. To provide for extreme floods, two side openings were
made, 41 1 and 35 feet span, of plate girders, one end resting on the masoniy
in the cast-iron cyhnders, and the other on a stone abutment landward, secured
on a platform and pUes. These bridges answer their purpose very satisfactorily.
The cost of No. 2 bridge, which consists of two openings of 122 feet, and two
side openings of 35 feet span, was £11,156. Total length of No. 2 350 feet
cost per lineal foot £31 17s. Qd. ; height above the bed of the river 36 feet.

    The cost of No. 3 bridge, consisting of two openings of 137 feet span, and
two side openings of 41| feet span, the cylinders being sunk into the bed of
the river 25 feet, amounted to £13,772. Length of No. 3, 419| feet; cost
£32 16s. Id. per lineal foot; height above the bed of the river 49 feet.

    No. 4 is the viaduct in the Pass of Killiecrankie already alluded to. It
consists of 10 arches of 35 feet span, with an extreme height from the foun-
dations to the top of the parapet of 54 feet, and is built with a curve of 20
chains radius. The Pass of Killiecrankie is a well-known object of picturesque

beauty, and it is generally admitted that the railway, now that the slopes
have attained their proper verdure, has in no way diminished its attractions.
Indeed this viaduct is thought to give it additional interest. 1 he cost was

£5720. It is adapted to the single line, and is 17 feet in width over
parapets. Length 508 feet ; cost per lineal foot £11 5s.

    No. 5 is a viaduct across the Biver Tilt, near Blair Atliole, spanning the

river by one wrought-iron girder of 150 feet. The abutments are of stone,

laid three feet below the bed of the river on a platform of timber 6 inches

thick secured to piles. As it is situated close to Blair Castle, it has been

made somewhat more ornate than was otherwise necessary. The cost of

this bridge is ^6500, being for a single line. Length 256 feet; cost

.£25 7s. 9d. per lineal foot ; height above the bed of the river 40 feet,

No. 6 is a bridge across the River Garry at Calvine of 3 spans, one of

80 and two of 40 feet, and is 55 feet from the bed of the river to the top of

the parapet. There was considerable difficulty in fixing the crossing of the

river at this place. The Garry is here a large and rapid mountain-stream,

on a rocky bed, with several falls immediately adjoining, running through an

ornamental plantation, and as this was a spot of interest in the grounds of

Blair Castle, we were precluded from crossing the river at any other point

within the demesne. It occurred to the writer, however, as the road-bridge

passed over about the narrowest part of the river, the object aimed at could be

effected both economically and unobjectionably by spanning both road and river,

thus forming an object of additional interest in this peculiar locality. The cost

of this bridge was =£5100. Length 274 feet ; cost per lineal foot ,£18 12s. 3d.

No. 7 is a bridge of no particular interest, 80 feet span, crossing the

Eiver Dahudn, a mountain-stream near Grantown, but is given as a specimen

of a substantial bridge of this size.  The cost  was :--Masonry £2238                                                                                       iron

work £1060. Total £3298. Length 148 feet ; height 27 feet ; cost per

lineal foot £22 5s. M.

No. 8 is a viaduct crossing a picturesque ravine and stream called the

Divie, 10 miles south of Forres. Its length is 477 feet, constructed for a

single line, and the cost amounted to £10,231. It is 106 feet in height from

the river-bed to the top of the parapet, and 16 feet in width; all the piers

within the limits of the stream are founded on rock. It consists of seven

arches of 45 feet span each. Cost per lineal foot £21 9s.

These viaducts constitute the principal works on the through line between

Perth and Forres. Tlie writer wiU now proceed to allude briefly to the

principal works on the coast-line between Keith and Bonar Bridge.

The portion from Keith to Inverness being one-half the distance of the

railway from Aberdeen to Inverness, the capital of the Highlands, extends

to 55 miles in length. It may be stated that this portion from Inverness to

Keith originally formed part of the Great North of Scotland Railway, the act

for which was obtained in 1846, but pecimiary difficulties prevented the

promoters from constructing this part of their scheme, involving, as it was then

supposed, the construction of very heavy work in the neighbourhood of the

River Spey, and it was eventually left to theHighland Companies to carry it out.

There is a deep and precipitous ravine on the south side of the Spey,

with flat meadows on the north side, and the original plan of the Great

North of Scotland Company was to cross the river at a gradient of 1 in

90 with a high viaduct, with expensive works in the ravine, at a cost

of about £100,000, the bridge being estimated at £60,000. After much

careful survey and consideration, and consultation with Messrs. Locke

and Errington regarding this work, it was fixed to pass through the ravine

by a gradient of 1 in 60 for 2| miles, which is the steepest gradient on

the Highland system, and span the river by a box girder of 230 feet, with

six side arches of masonry, each of 30 feet span, to meet the contingency

of flood waters, which are on this river very sudden and very rapid, and the

work has been carried out successfully. It may be mentioned that this was

about the greatest single span of an open girder at the time built (1856).

The propriety of a stone bridge at this place, with a gradient of 1 in 70, was

considered by the Directors, but it was found to be too expensive. The

present Hne, however, answers quite sufficiently for the traffic of the country.

which is now chiefly local since the opening of the Highland line. The cost

of the bridge, which is 660 feet long and 74 feet high from the foundations

to the top of the towers, constructed for a double line, was .£34,480 ; cost

per lineal foot £52 5s. The east abutment of this bridge is founded on rock,

and it was provided that the west abutment should be sunk and founded on

piles and a platform, the iirst imperfect trials having led to the conclusion

that there was nothing bej'ond indurated shingle at this place. On sinking

14 feet from the surface, however, through a conglomerate of boulders 2 to

3 feet in diameter, hard mountain clay appeared, and on penetrating this

for about 3 feet, rock was found, thus securing for this structure a rock

foundation on either side. Immediately at the east end of this viaduct, the

line, as already said, runs through a narrow and precipitous ravine, the

stream of which had to be diverted for the railway, by a new channel cut out

of the sohd gravel 30 feet wide, sloping longitudinally 1 in 40, and pitched

with stones from 12 to 18 inches deep. This pitching, which consists of squared

stones, had to a smaU extent broken up several times since the line was

opened ten years ago, from the floods bringing down stones and trees, and

we found that the most efl'ectual way of securing it was by inserting^walings

of timber 40 feet apart, 12 inches by 4 inches, across the channel, secured

at every 3 feet by iron piles, and grouting the joints of the pitching in dry

weather with lime-grout so as to prevent the lodgment of aii* and water,

which imder the pressure of floods has a tendency to dislocate the stone work.

No. 10 is a viaduct crossing the Finclhorn, a dangerous and rapid river.

It sometimes comes down in great flood, almost in a body of 2 or 3 feet

of perpendicular height at a time, notwithstanding that in summer it is a

very moderate-sized stream. This bridge consists of three spans of 150 feet

each, with stone abutments and piers of solid ashlar, and is constructed for a

single line. There was no appearance of rock in the immediate neighbour-

hood of the site, although rock appeared on one side of the river about half

a mile above ; and the channel, as far as could be ascertained, consisted of

shingle and gravel. It was provided, therefore, that the foundation should

be sunk 6 feet below the deepest part of the bed of the river on a platform and

piles. The east abutment was so sunk, and the piles were driven through

the gravel to a depth of 10 feet, making 16 feet below the bed of the river.

It was observed that at that depth the piles uniformly would drive no further,

and this suggested the possibiHty of rock. Rock was accordingly searched

for, and it was found that about 18 feet under the bed of and across the

river, rock existed. Cofferdams were therefore formed, and rock foundations

were secuj'ed for the remaining piers and abutment. The cost of the bridge,

including a pitched embankment on the east side, the bottom of which was

--secured by piles and a waling of timber, amounted masonry to .£11,170
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

   No. 11 is a hi-idge across the River Nairn, consisting of four arches of 55 feet

span, and is an admirable piece of masonry. An incident connected with the

foundations of this bridge deserves to be mentioned. The contractor, when

instructed to ascertain the nature of the foundations, insisted that it was

unnecessary to take any trouble about them, as rock cropped out on either

bank                         the turnpike-road bridge across the  river a quarter  of  a  mile  below

was founded on rock, and he said there could be no doubt that rock would

be got in the centre 3 or 4 feet below the bed of the river. Eock, however,

was not reached until we sunk from 13 to 14 feet, showing that experienced
persons may be misled even under the most convincing circumstances. The

structure, however, is founded on the solid rock throughout, and the cost for

a double line was £8620. Length 371 feet ; height 56 feet ; cost per
Kneal foot £23 4s. 8d.

    No. 12 is a viaduct across the Ness, consisting of five arches of 73 feet span
over the river, 4 land arches of 20 feet span, and 2 cast-iron openings
of 27 and 35 feet span over roads. The foundations of this bridge, as in

many others, consisted of shingle for 20 feet down, but at the north abut-

ment and pier tlie iron rods driven in appeared to penetrate considerably
easier than at other points of the channel, and it was deemed prudent to
construct this abutment and pier upon bearing piles and a platform, and
they were accordingly so done, as exhibited in the drawings. The total
length of this bridge, including the side arches, is 669 feet, and the total
height from the bed of the river to the top of the parapet is 40 feet. It is
constructed for a single line, and cost £13,410. Cost per lineal foot =£20.

    No. 13 is a good example of a siuing bridge built across the Caledonian
Canal, which the line spans on a skew of 65 degrees. It consists of 2
girders of 126 feet in length, 78 feet of which, from the centre of the turn-
table, spans the canal, and the remaining 48 feet forms the balance weight.
Advantage was taken of the canal being emptied for repaii-s to lay the foun-
dations of the masonry, which are on a platform and piles in the sohd gravel,
9 feet below the surface of the water. The depth of the canal is 18 feet,
and the width of the locks 40 feet, the canal banks being 120 feet apart.
Some difficulty occurred at first during hot weather from the expansion of
the iron aff'ecting the adjustment and closing of the bridge, which was
remedied by means of a powerful screw, and the bridge has been worked with
satisfaction and safety for the last five years. This bridge, with its machinery,
timber, wharves for protection from vessels, distant and station signals, &c.,
complete, cost £4718.

   No. 14 spans the River Conon in Ross-shire. From peculiar circumstances
it was necessary that this bridge should cross the river on a skew of 45
degrees to the stream, and as there were rock foundations, there was no
difficulty to contend with beyond that of 4 or 5 feet of water in the channel
of the river to reach the rock, which was successfully accomplished. The
peculiarity of the skew with the river at this place would have been more
easily provided for by the adoption of iron girders from pier to pier, but

as the writer found at that time that iron girders would be fully as expen-
sive, and not so permanent as a stone bridge, and as there were admirable
quarries in the neighbourhood, he resolved to construct this bridge, as already
said, on a skew of 45 degrees with the river, by a series of right-angled ribs
or arches spanning from pier to pier. This is no new arrangement ; but the
writer is not aware of the plan being adopted for a series of arches of so
large a span in any previous instance. The bridge consists of 5 arches of
73 feet span each, the arches being constructed of four ribs, each 3 feet 9
inches wide ; the arch-stones are 4 feet deep at the springing, and 3 feet
deep at the crown. The keystones of the centre part of each arch were made
to connect with each other, as were the stones in the haunchings of the
arches, and some cramps of iron were inserted at the joints to connect the
ribs. The work was successfully accomplished, and constitutes a very perfect
piece of bridge masonry. The total length of the bridge is 540 feet, and the
height 45 feet from the bed of the river. The north abutment is founded

304 feet lower down the river than the south, and the whole structure, when
the centres were removed, was found so accurately built that no joint in it
showed any indication of setting. The cost of this bridge for a single line
was £11,391. Cost per lineal foot £21 2s.

   There are many other bridges, as may be supposed, over so great an extent

of country, and a country so much exposed to floods, but those above de-

 scribed are the principal ; the entire waterway spanned over the entire system

being 9828 feet.

    On the Central Railway from Dunkeld to Forres, 104 miles, being a single

line, there are 8 viaducts, 126 bridges over streams, 119 public and ac-

 commodation road-bridges, and 8100 yards of covered drains, varying in size

 from 18 to 36 inches square. There are 1650 lineal yards of breastwalls,

 .304,700 cubic yards of rock cutting, and 3,416,000 cubic yards of earth-

 work, being, including rock and earth, at the rate of 35,776 cubic yards to
the mile. The largest embankment was at Rafford near Forres, which con-

 tained 308,000 cubic yards.

    The permanent way consists of larch and natural-grown Scotch fir sleepers

of the usual size, 3 feet apart ; the chairs are 22 lbs. in weight ; the rails

weigh 75 lbs. to the lineal yard, are in lengths of 24 feet, and are fished at

the joints.

    The total cost of the works, including all extra and accommodation works,
amounted for the 104 miles, to £798,311 ; the land, including severance, to
J70,000 ; and the preliminary, parliamentary, engineering, and law expenses
to i;50,893, making the cost of this portion of the Companv's lines £919,204,
or £8860 per mile*.

    The contracts were entered into immediately after the passing of the Bill
in July 1801 ; the first turf of the railway was cut on the 17th of October of
the same year, and the whole line was passed by the Government Inspector,
and opened for pubUc traffic on the 9th of September 1863, being one year
and ten months, an uuprecedentedly short time for works of such magnitude.
The works between Forres and Dunkeld were divided into nine contracts let
by public competition, and were undertaken £15,705 below the Engineer's
estimate, and were completed at 12 per cent, over the Engineer's estimate,
including 4 per cent, for accommodation works ordered by land valuators.

    The trafiic has been worked successfully and without accident for four
years. The mail trains perform the journey between Inverness and Perth
(144 miles) in 5^ hours. It was proposed to the Post Office, but not agreed
to, on account of the expense, to run them in four hours.

   An ordinary goods train of 20 waggons, or 200 tons gross load, is drawn

up the steepest inclines by one engine, having 17-inch cylinders and 24-

inch stroke.

    The traffic is rapidly increasing. The sheep and cattle, which used to
reach the southern markets by a toilsome journey of a month or six weeks,

are now conveniently transported in a day at less cost, the Company having
carried in one week upwards of 21,000 sheep.

    In passing over the mountain-ridges already described, it was feared that
serious interruptions would arise from snow during the winter, but as the
writer had a knowledge of the whole country for many years, he did not
anticipate any difficulty on this head which might not be overcome. The
summit is about 500 feet higher than that of the Caledonian line, or some
1500 feet in all above sea-level, and is no doubt more exposed. The first
winter, viz. 1863-64, it was wholly open and the traffic uninterrupted ; in
February of the second winter, viz. 1865, a very heavy snow-storm occurred
all over the north of Scotland, impeding the traffic of almost all the northern
railways, and stopping the traffic on the Highland line for four or five days,
which was only restored with great difficulty by the labour of large bodies of

men. It was evident, therefore, that some decided steps must be adopted

to overcome the snow difficulty, and in the beginning of 1866 the road was

kept pretty well open by the application of snow-ploughs ; and the expe-
rience of that winter made it quite clear that this difficulty might, with

proper appliances, be effectually overcome, and means were accordingly

adopted for that piirpose.

   In these elevated regions, when a snow-storm occurs, it is accompanied

with high wind, and the snow is consequently drifted with great rapidity
into the hollows and cuttings. With the view of obviating this, screen
fences of light timber, or of decayed sleepers, or earthen mounds were
erected a few yards from each side of the cuttings where the line was exposed.
These were found very effective for intercepting the drifts. There was then

--provided snow ploughs of three descriptions, viz : One, a light plough fixed

to all the engines running on the line, and capable of clearing 12 to 24 inches

of new snow. The second was a more formidable snow plough, which was
fixed to a pilot engine, and was found capable of clearing 2 to 5 feet of
snow. This pilot engine was attached to goods or passenger trains. The
thii'd, and largest class of plough was found to clear snow 10 or 11 feet

deep, with the aid of four or five goods engines. These appliances, notwith-

standing the very serious snow-storms which were encountered on the line

in January last, were capable of keeping the line almost whoUy clear.

This I consider a great triumph, inasmuch as the Highland line, over

such high elevations, was kept clear, while, by the same storm, the lines

throughout  Scotland,  England,  and France were  more or less   blocked up
                                                                                                             ;

the lines in the north of Scotland being stopped entirely five or six days

the mails for Aberdeen being delayed three days from London, and two from

Edinburgh. The Norfolk line was blocked up for some days ; the Holyhead

mail detained from 12 to 16 hours ; the London, Chatham, and Dover blocked

up for two days, as well as the trains in France to Marseilles.

   Much credit is due to the activity and attention of the Highland Company's

--officers Mr. Stroudley, the Locomotive Superintendent, and Mr. Buttle, Su-
--perintendent of Permanent Way Mr. Stroudley having planned and con-

structed the snow-ploughs.

   As a specimen of a cheaply constructed line of railway, the -writer annexes
a note of the details of the northern portion of the Highland Railway, from
Invergordon to Bonar Bridge, 26 ^ miles in length. The country through
which this section of the line passes is comparatively level, and several parts
skirt and run through the sea, where the works had to be protected at con-
siderable cost. The cuttings amounted to 549,000 cubic yards, of which
about 20,000 were rock. There are 27 bridges over streams, 4 of them
40 to 50 feet span, 26 public and accommodation road-bridges, and 2942
lineal yards of drains, varying from 18 to 36 inches square. The rails are
double-headed and weigh 70 lbs. to the yard, and are fished at the joints

I of the chairs are 20 1 lbs., and § 28 lbs. in weight. There are ten stations,
with permanent dwelling-houses for the agents and porters.

   The total cost of this portion of the line, the works being of the very best
quality, and the masonry aU of stone, amounted to £5018 per mile, or in-
cluding parliamentary and law expenses and land, £5888 per mile.

   Commercially, these lines, extending over 246 miles, have not as yet been
quite successful, from the fact of too great an extent of line having been

undertaken at once, it requiring in an agricultural country considerable

time to develope the traffic.

Under the whole circumstances, however, the traffic is satisfactory.
The works are of the most substantial character. The capital account,
       ON THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF STEEL.                     161

which is under ,£2,800,000, is about closed as far as new works are concerned,

while the revenue is rapidly increasing. For the half-year just ended, the

Company will be able to pay its preference and debenture stocks, 5 per cent, on

its floating liabilities, and about 2 per cent, on its ordinary stock of =£740,000.
    It will thus be seen that if the revenue increases in the same ratio that it

has hitherto done, viz. from ,£15,000 to ,£20,000 per annum, the Company will

be able to pay in two or three years a satisfactory dividend of 5 per cent. When
that event occm-s, the Directors may with propriety give some moderate aid

to the farther extension of the main lines of commmaication to Caithness and
Skye, both of which must prove valuable feeders to the Highland system.

   These lines were promoted chiefly by the great landed proprietors in the
country, among the most prominent of which were the Earl of Seafield,
Lord Fyfe, Mr. Matheson of Ardross, M.P., Mr. Meriy of BeUadrum, M.P.,
Mr. M'Intosh of Raigmore, Col. Fraser Tytler, the Duke of Sutherland, &c.

Experimental Researches on the Mechanical Properties of Steel.

               By W. Fairbairn, LL.D., F.R.S., &^c.

There is probably no description of material that has undergone greater

changes in its manufacture than iron ; and, judging from the attempts that

are now making, and have been made, to improve its quality and to enlarge

its sphere of application, we may reasonably conclude that it is destined to

attain still greater advances in its chemical and mechanical properties. The

earliest improvements in the process of the manufacture of iron may be

attributed to Cort, who introduced the process of boiling and puddling in the

reverberatory furnace, and those of more recent date to Eessemcr, who first

used a separate vessel for the reduction of the metals, and thus eflected

more important changes in the manufacture of iron and steel than had been

introduced at any former period in metallurgic history. To the latter system

we owe most of the improvements that have taken place ; for by the compara-

tively new and interesting process of burning out the carbon in a separate

vessel almost every description of steel and refined iron may be produced.

--The same results may be obtained by the puddling furnace, but not to the

same extent, since the artificial blast of the Bessemer principle acts with

much greater force in depriving the metal of its carbon, and in reducing it to

the state of refined iron. By this new process increased facilities are aftbrded

for attaining new combinations by the introduction of measured quantities

of carbon into the converting vessel, and this may be so regulated as to form

steel or iron of the homogeneous state, of any known quality.

By the boiling and puddling processes, steel of similar combinations may

bo produced, but with less certainty as regards quality, as everything depends

on the skill of the operator in closing the furnace at the precise moment

of time. This precaution is necessary in order to retain the exact quantity

of carbon in the mass so as to produce by combination the requisite

quality of steel. It will be observed that in the Bessemer process this un-

certainty does not exist, as the whole of the carbon is volatilized or burnt

out in the first instance ; and by pouring into the vessel a certain quantity

of crude metal containing carbon, any percentage of that element may be

obtained in combination with the u-on, possessing qualities best adapted to

the varied forms of construction to which the metal may be applied. Thus

the Bessemer system is not only more perfect in itself, but admits of a greater

degree of certainty in the results than could possibly be attained from the

1868.                                                          N
--163 REPORT 1867.

mere employment of the eyes and hands of the most experienced puddler.
Thus it appears that the Bessemer process enables us to manufacture steel
"with any given proportion of carbon, or other eligible element, and thus to
describe the compound metal in terms of its chemical constituents.

   Important changes have been made since Mr. Bessemer first announced his
new principle of conversion, and the results obtained from various quarters
bid fair to establish a new epoch in metaUurgic manipulation, by the pro-
duction of a material of much greater general value than that which was pro-
duced by the old process, and in most cases of double the strength of ii'on.

    These improvements are not exchisively confined to the Bessemer process,

for a great variety of processes are now in operation producing the same
results, and hence we have now in the market homogeneous, and every other

description of iron, inclusive of steel of such density, ductility, &c., as to meet
all the requirements of the varied forms of construction.

   The chemical properties of these diflereut kinds of steel have been satis-
factorily established ; but we have no reliable knowledge of the mechanical
properties of the ditferent kinds of homogeneous iron and steel that are now
being produced. To supply this desideratum, I have endeavoured, by a

series of laborious experiments, to determine the comparative values of the

different kinds of steel, as regards their powers of resistance to transverse,
tensile, and compressive strain.

    These experiments have been instituted not only for those engaged in the

constructive arts, but also to enable the engineer to make such selections of
the material as will best suit his purpose in any proposed construction. In

order to arrive at correct results, I have applied to the first houses for the
specimens experimented iipon, and judging from the results of these experi-

ments, I venture to hope that new and important data have been obtained,
which may safely be relied upon in the selection of the material for the

different forms of construction.

   For several years past attempts have been made to substitute steel for
iron, on account of its superior tenacity and increased security in the con-
struction of boilers, bridges, &c. ; and assuredly there can be no doubt as to
the desirability of emplopng a material of the same weight and of double the
strength, provided it can at all times be relied upon. Some difficulties, how-
ever, exist, and until tlioy are removed it would not be safe to make the
transfer from iron to steel. These difficulties may be summed up in a few
words, viz. the want of uniformity in the manufacture, in cases of rolled
plates and other articles which require perfect resemblance in character, and
the uncertainty which pervades its production. Time and close observation
of facts in connexion "SNith the different processes wiU, however, surmount
these difficulties, and will enable the manufactm-er to produce steel in all
its varieties with the same certainty as he formerly attained in the manu-

factture of iron.

    In the selection of the different specimens of steel, I have endeavoured to
obtain such information about the ores, fuel, and process of manufacture as
the parties supplying the specimens were disposed to furnish. To a series of
questions, answers were, in most cases, cheerfully given, the particulars of
which wiU be found in the Tables.

    I have intimated that the specimens have been submitted to transverse,

tensile, and compressive strain, and the summaries of results wiU indicate
the uses to which the different specimens may bo applied. Table I. gives
for each specimen the modulus of elasticity and the modulus of resistance to

impact, together with the deflection for unity of pressui-e ; from these experi-

 mental data tlie engineer and architect may select the steel possessing the
 actual quality required for any particiUar structure. This wiU be found

 especially reqxusite in the construction of boilers, ships, bridges, and other

 structures subjected to severe strains, where safety, strength, and economy
 should be kept in view.

     In the case of transverse strain some difficulties presented themselves in
 the course of the experiments, arising from the ductile natui-e of some part
 of the material, and from its tendency to bend or deflect to a considerable
 depth without fracture.

    But this is always the case with tough bars whether of iron or steel,
 and hence the necessity of fixing upon some unit of measure of the deflections,

in order to compare the flexibility of the bars with one another, and, from

the mean value of this unit of deflection, to obtain a mean value of the

modiilus of elasticity (E) for the different bars. This unit or measure of

flexibility given in the Table is the mean value of aU the deflections corre-
sponding to unity of pressure and section. The modulus of elasticity has
also been calculated from the deflection produced by 112 lbs., in order that
it may be compared with the results of experiments on cast iron, given at

pages 73 and 74 in my work ' On the Application of Iron to BuUding Pur-

poses.' In order to determiae the resistance of the bars to a force analogous

to that of impact, the ivorl- in deflecting each bar up to its Emit of elasticity
has been calculated. These results differ considerably from each other,
showing the different degrees of hardness, ductility, &c. of the material of
which the bars are composed. The transverse strength of the different bars
up to their limit of elasticity is shown by the amount of the modulus of

strength or the unit of strenfjth calculated for each bar.

    Table II., on tensile strain, gives the breaking strain of each bar per
square inch of section, and the corresponding elongation of the bar per unit
of length, together with the ultimate resistance of each bar to a force analo-
gous to that of impact.

    Table III., on compression, gives the force per square inch of section
requisite to crush short columns of the different specimens, with the corre-
sponding compression of the column per unit of length, together with the work
expended in producing this compression.

   Having selected the requisite number of specimens from different works,
the experiments commenced with the transverse strains, which were con-
ducted as on former occasions, by suspending dead weights from the middle
of the bar, which was supported at its extremities, the supports being 4 feet

wooden frame A, to which were bolted two iron brackets, BE, on which the

bars were laid. Immediately over the centre of the bar, at a point equi-

distant between the supports, the wheel and screw C was attached to the

Dscale  on which the weights were placed, 56 lbs. at a time ; after each

weight was laid on, the deflections were taken, and the experiment was con-

tinued until a large permanent set was obtained. The permanent set was

--observed at intervals in the following manner : After the deflection pro-

duced by the load had been ascertained, the screw C was turned so as to raise

the scale and relieve the bar of the load, thus enabling the experimenter to

ascertain the eff'ects of the load upon the bar and to register the permanent

set. This operation was conducted with great precision, as may be seen on

consulting the Tables in the experiments which follow.

Each of the bars have been treated in this way, care having been taken to

secure portions of each bar for the experiments on tension and compression.

   Prom the above Summary of Results may be taken almost every descrip-
tion of steel manufactured for the purposes of construction, when subjected to
a transverse strain. The utmost care has been taken to work out the con-

ditions and properties of the specimens ; and assuming that these conditions

would be fuliillcd by the manufacturer, the engineer, the architect, or the

builder, he could have no difficulty in selecting such material as he may

requii'e in the varied forms of constructions and uses for which it is in-

tended.

It will be observed that in every description of manufacture, and in every

description of each manufacture, the whole of the transverse properties
have been determined, both as regards the modulus of elasticity and de-
flection, and the measure of work done (as indicated by the unit of working
strength, which will be found in the last column). The deflections up to the
limit of weights laid on, as also for unity of section, wiU be found in the

fourth and fifth columns.
   It might have been desirable to have received from the makers more ex-

tended information as regards the different processes of conversion, and the

quality of the ores, crude iron, &c. from which the specimens were obtained

these with the chemical constituents of the material would have been highly

myvaluable. But in  endeavours to arrive at correct results, much had to be

left to the discretion' of those who selected the samples, and to the honesty

of purpose by which they were guided in the selection. It is only natural
that the manufacturer shoidd select samples from which the best results

would be obtained, in order that he might in every test stand high in the

scale of utility. On the other hand, it must be observed that it is not the

material of the greatest density and strength that is required on all occasions

on the contrary, it is quite the reverse for many purposes, as in some cases it

is essential to have the metal soft and ductile, easily worked, and convertible
into shapes where its flexibihty would be important. Again, any hard

brittle steel capable of retaining a fine edge is of inestimable use for tools,
but it is totally inapplicable to structural purposes, where elasticity and
strength is required for endurance. All these are points which I have en-

deavoured to attain and simplify in the experiments, and having indicated

then- properties in the above Summary on Transverse Strain, we now proceed

to those which refer to tension.
   In submitting wrought iron or steel bars to a transverse strain, the same

results are not obtained as in cast iron, as bars 4 feet 6 inches long of the

former material will bend or deflect through a depth of some feet before

fracture ensues, the deflections in this case being equivalent to a permanent

set nearly equal to the deflection. Under these conditions, when the per-
manent set arrives at one-half the amount of the deflection, I have considered
the resisting powers of the bars so much injured as to render any additional

strain of no practical value. In the case of steel bars of greater density and

hardness, the same law between the deflection and the permanent set does

not exist, and hence the diiference of elasticity in the diff'erent kinds of steel
of which the bars are composed. To remedy these discrepancies and effect a
comparison between the different qualities of the material, it was necessary

--to iix; some limitation to the weights laid on, and to ascertain the point of

strain corresponding to the clastic limit, which in the calculations is that

point where the deflection is not in excess of what the law of deflection (viz.
in proportion to the strain) would indicate, whilst the next greater strain

gives a deflection decidedly in excess of that law. This is, however, clearly

explained in the abstract of results.
ON THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF STEEL.             221

A very slight variation in the observed deflection at the commencement of

the experiments before the bar had got its natural set would increase the

difficulty of ascertaining the correct permanent set corresponding to very

Welimited strains.  all know when a bar is a little bent we can make it

straight by hammering or by pressure, but the probability is that the first

form is the natural disposition of the material.
    This principle is adopted in the calculations, as the elasticity of a bar is

impaired when the deflection decidedly exceeds what the law of deflection
would give. After the elastic limit is passed the deflections increase in a
geometric progression, whereas up to that limit the deflections are in propor-

tion to the strain.

   One of the marked peculiarities of steel as compared with iron is, that the
strain corresponding to the elastic limit approaches more nearly the breaking

strain. Hence will be found the comparative high value of the constant G,

Aor the unit of pressure determined for the bars.  load of one-third the

breaking weight has always been considered a safe rule, but it is only con-

ventional ; but there is something still wanting relative to the point of strain
corresponding to the injury done to the material, as the inference drawn
from the Tables indicates that the strain producuig the permanent set had

not seriously affected the soundness of the bars. This is a question of con-
siderable importance, and requires further investigation, which I hope to

accomplish at some futm-e time.

   It will be observed from tbe above Summary of Results, that in the re-
duction of tbe experiments to tbe vahie of u, or work done in producing
rupture, some of tbe specimens are as low as 72 when tbe metal is bard and

brittle, and as bigb as 6403 (in Exp. 14) wbere tbe specimen is of ductile
Bessemer steel. It required tbe utmost precision to determine witb perfect
accuracy tbe elongations of tbe barder specimens at tbe potut of rupture ; and
altbougb tbe elongationsVere magnified and carefully taken, tbey are uever-
tbeless not to be relied upon wbere tbe value of u is under 300. It would
bave been more correct to bave taken tbe elongations from bars three or four
times tbe length ; but this could not be accomplished from tbe same bars, as

m most cases it was next to impossible to bave them reduced to tbe required

dimensions without heating tbe bars and drawing them out under the hammer.
This process would bave rendered them useless for comparison, which is not
the case in tbe present experiments, where the rupture by tension is identical
with that by compression, as they were cut from the same bars after having
been submitted to a transverse strain. Prom this it will be seen that each
bar has undergone without change the three separate tests of tensUe, com-
pressive, and transverse strain.

                  Abstract of the Results of Tables I., II., and III.

                  --Transverse Strain. Table I.

   The results of these experiments show that, within the elastic limits, the
deflections are in proportion to the pressures ; for example, in Experiment 1,

=the deflections are almost exactly expressed by the formida 2 -001361 lu,

where the constant -001361 is the mean, D^, of all the deflections for a
unity of weight derived from formula (3). By aid of this principle the value
of the weight, w, with its equivalent deflection, corresponding to the elastic
limit, was determined.

   The mean value of Dj, given in col. 4, the deflection corresponding to unity
of pressure and section, may be taken as the measure of the Jlexibiliti/ of the

different bars. In general, the least flexible bars give the highest values of

E and C, and, other things being the same, or nearly the same, the most

flexible bars give the highest values of u, the work of deflection correspond-

ing to unity of section.

   The bars of some of the experiments, 10, 18, 28, &c., with more than
an average flexibility, gave very high values for C, the working unit
of resistance to transverse strain, showing their great value when applied to
the springs of carriages and other constructions, where flexibility and
strength should be combined. Such bars as those of experiments 1, 12, 21,
&c., with less than an average flexibility, gave at least an average value for
C, showing their apphcability to all constructions where rigidity and strength
are requu-ed ; and so on to other cases.

   The mean value of E, the modulus of elasticity, given in col. 5, taken for
thirty of the best specimens, is 31,000,000 nearly, whilst the mean taken
for a like number, in col, 4, is about 32,000,000. This modulus exceeds
that of wrought iron by more than the 30th part. Steel having a much
greater flexibility than wrought iron, accounts for the approximation of their
values for the modulus of elasticity. The bars that have the greatest flexi-

bility, or the great value of Dj, other tilings being the same, have the least
value for the modulus of elasticity.

   The values of w, or the work of deflection for the unity of section up to

the elastic Hmit, may be taken as measures of the qualities of bars where

flexibility and strength are required.
   The bars generally exhibit very high powers of resistance to transverse

strain. The mean value of the unit of working strength, C, given in col. 9,
taken for one-half the number of experiments, is 6-83 tons, and for the
remaining half (omitting the last two experiments) this constant is 5-23
tons, giving a general mean of 6 tons. In the model tube of the Britannia
and Conway bridges, the value of the constant for hreahing weight is

6-7 tons.

   Taking 11 tons per square inch as the mean value of the compressive and
tensile resistances of wrought iron at the elastic limit, the value of C in

this case will be less than 2 tons ; hence it follows that the transverse
strength of these steel bars will be about 3| times the strength of wrought-
iron bars of the same dimensions.

    In order to determine the relative value of the two kinds of material
undergoing transverse strain, let us suppose two bars of the same length,
one steel and the other iron, having the same strength, to be similar in their

transverse sections ; then, as the strength of bars of similar section are as the
cubes of their depths,

where d is the depth of the steel bar, d^ that of the iron bar, and p =3-5,

the ratio of their units of working strength.

sions,

                                    d-

   Now taking the cost of iron at £7 per ton, and that of steel at .£12, we

have for the relative cost of the two materials of the same strength.

       Iron 7x2-3052 16-1364

       -Steel 12 - ~12~ = ^ ^^^"'

that is, the cost of the iron would be about 1-1- times that of the steel.
    In the case of railway bars and such constructions, besides this saving in

the cost of material, it must be borne in mind that the steel rail would last

four times as long as the iron rail.

                   --Tensile Strain. Table II.

   Taking the mean of the results of the experiments on thirty of the best
specimens, we find the mean tenacity per sqiiare inch =47-7 tons.

   Now if we take 25 tons per square inch as the tenacity of the best Eno'lish

hammered iron iu bars, it follows that the tenacity of these steel bars will

be about twice (1-91 time) that of the iron bai's.

                                        Economic use of the Material.

    For bars of equal strength, undergoing tensUe strain, the iron bar should
be about twice the section of the steel bar; now if the cost of steel be -£12
per ton, and that of iron .£7, then, for a ton of metal in each case, the com-
parative cost of bars of equal strength will be

       = =Iron bars 7x1-91 13-37
       Steel bars"^ l2              -i2~ l"ll-*5

that is, the cost of the iron would be more than once and one-tenth that of

the steel ; in this case, therefore, the steel would be the more economical

metal. The saving per ton of material would be ,£1-37, or £1 7s. 4|f?.

The work producing rupture in the different specimens is very variable,

owing probably, to some extent, to the errors arising from the determina-

tion of such exceedingly small elongations. This irregularity would have

been avoided if the specimens had been of greater length, so that the elonga-

tions might have been ascertained with greater accuracy.

The greatest value (6403) of this work of elongation is given in expt. 14,

where the breaking strain of the specimen is below the average, being only

about 40 tons per square inch.

The specimen (see expt. IS) which had the greatest tenacity, viz. about

60 tons per square inch, required only 670 units of work to produce rup-

ture ; this arises from the very small elongation, viz. -01, which the bar

sustained at the point of rupture.

374 KEPORT--1867.

   The ultimate elongations are unaccountably variable, and seem much below
what might have been expected ; even the greatest elongation, ·1437, given

in the Table, is below the average for iron bars, whilst the least elongation,
·0037, produced by a strain of 38^ tons per square inch, is only about the
60th part of this average.

                        --Compression. ^Table III.

    Thirty-two of the bars supported each a pressure of 100-7 tons per square
inch of section without undergoing any sensibble fracture, whilst twenty-
three bars were more or less fractured with this pressure.

   The mean value of the compression per unit of length, given in col. 6 of the
Table, taken for 24 of the best specimens, is -372 ; whilst the mean taken for
the remaining specimens is '232, giving a general mean deflection of "302.

   The work, u, expended in crushing the material in short columns is re-
markably large. The mean value of u, given in col. 7, taken for 26 of the
best specimens, is 41300 ; whilst the mean taken for the remaining speci-
mens is 25400, giving a general mean value of 33400.

    If 6000 be taken as the value of m, in the case of tensile strain, then the
work expended in rupturing the material by compression wUl be 5| times
the work expended in rupturing the material by extension.

Tensile and compressive Resistances compared.

   Taking the mean tensile resistance to rupture at 47^7 tons per square
inch, it follows that their resistance to compression is more than double

(2-1 times) their resistance to extension : thus -2pv7^=2-l. Hence it fol-

lows that the most economic form of a steel bar imdergoing transverse strain

would be a bar with double flanchcs, having the area of the bottom flauch

aboiit double that of the top flanch.

This conclusion is borne out by the results of experiments on transverse

strain, where S^, the strain per square inch of the material at the elastic

=6C=6xlimit,  6-83 tons=40-98, or 41 tons nearly; but the mean break-

ing strain per square inch by extension =47"7 tons, clearly indicating that

the compressive resistance in the former case was considerably .in excess of

the tensile resistance.

It is important in every experiment on the strength of materials, which

enters so largely into constructive art, that we should be thoroughly ac-

quainted with the properties of the material of which the striicture is com-
posed, and that its resistance in all the different forms of strain should be

clearly and distinctly ascertained. In the foregoing experiments we have

determined the resisting powers of the different specimens to bending, ten-

sion, and compression ; but we have omitted that of torsion, or twisting,
until we have an opportunity of doing so upon the same identical bars.

These I hope to accomplish in a separate commiuiication, and also to give
some further results on an enlarged scale, calculated to coniinn what has

already been done, and to ascertain some additional facts in regard to the

changes now in progress in the manufacture of Bessemer steel.

   ing of J. Gw\N Jefyueys, F.R.S., Rev. Thomas Hincks, Jonathan

   CoucHj F.L.S., Charles Stewart, F.L.S., J. Brooking RowEj

   F.L.S., and J. Ralfs, F.L.S. Reporter, C. Spence Bate, F.R.S. ^c.

In presenting their Second Report, the Committee heg to state that their

eudeavonr has been, as much as possible, to direct their researches towards

--the discovery of rare or new species, to retake, upon the ground on Avhich

they were originally found, specimens similar to those that have been de-

scribed by Leach and Montagu, some of whose typical specimens have been

lost, misplaced, or destroyed. This is more tiiie in regard to the Crustacea

--than perhaps of any otlier class of animals a circumstance, when taken in

connexion with the curt descriptions of the animals given by the authors,

that materially interferes with the power of zoologists to pronounce with con-

fidence upon the relation that any fresh specimens may bear to those tyi^es.
   To carry out this plan as much as possible, we have du'ected our investiga-

tions hitherto mostly between Bigbury Bay toward the east, and the Dodman

toward the west. "S^^ithin these limits our dredging and trawling has been

mostly carried on within a distance of about twenty miles of the shore, and

in water that has not exceeded fifty fathoms in depth.

Eisn.--As regards the obtaining of fish, the sweep of a dredge, Mr. Couch

says, is too limited to aiford a prospect of much success ; and our notes about
them can be but few. In shallow depths the Megrim or Scaldfish {Bhomhus

arnoghssus) was obtained in abundance ; but none were found at between
forty and fifty fathoms. At the latter depth the Launcelet and larger Launce

had lain biu'ied in the sand ; as regards the latter, it seems worthy of notice

that at this season the large abundance of its species have changed their

quarters so as to approach the shore, while at least in this one instance an

example has remained buried in its winter haunt. An observation made by

an intelligent fisherman may also be deserving of notice. It refers to the

habit of some small individuals of several kinds of fish seeking shelter within

the cavity of some of the larger species of medusfe. Very small Scads, Bibs,

and "Whiting Pollacks are often found thus attending on these medusa?, so as

to accompany them wherever they float ; and on the least alarm they have

recourse to the shelter thus off'ered to them ; so that on lifting one of these

creatures into the boat there were found concealed within the cavities no

--less than sLrty-hvo young Scads from which the question arises, As these

medusas are generally believed to come to us from a warmer region, may they

not be the means of conveying to us young fishes of rarer sorts, which other-

wise might not have visited us ?

   Among the rarer fishes which have come to our knowledge since our last

Report to the Meeting of the British Association, I may be permitted to

--mention Ausonia cuvieri, of which an account is given in the Journal of the

Zoological Society, and also what there is some reason to judge a distinct

the British seas, to which we have the pleasure of adding several interest-

ing and important species.

The entrance to the English channel appears in its position to be the

Weboundary or extreme limits of two several faunas.                                            find species that are

decidedly arctic in their character rejjresented by specimens that have a

generally depauperized appearance, both as to size and tyjncal expression,

while Mediterranean species are represented without any large amount of

variation in form or dimensions of specimens. But our observations induce

us to believe that the southern forms, when taken on our shores, are gene-

rally dredged from water of considerable depth, whereas those of the arctic

types are as invariably taken in shallow water.

The variation of depths and local habitats appear to us to depend more

upon the condition of food and its general supply than from other causes

we therefore think that the geographical distribution of animals in limited

regions can only be worked out by a previous knowledge of the history of the

--animals, particularly in relation to their food and even then cannot be very

rehable.

The annexed list of Crustacea exhibits the various species that have been

recently taken by members of this Committee.

   \Ve have recently taken three fine specimens on the shelly ground off the

Dodman in about thirty fathoms of water. The fii'st specimen that we ob-
tained differed from those previously known and described bj having, instead

of a long central rostriform spine flanked by two shorter ones of atialogous

--construction, three equally important anteriorly porrected spines this in

consequence of the two lateral spines being developed to a length corre-

sponding with that of the central in normal sjjecimens ; whilst in another

specimen the central spine appears to be rather longer in proportion to the

lateral ones than that figured by either Leach or Prof. Bell, and the specimen

bears a very close relationship to Galathea monodon of Milne-Edwards from

Brazil--a cii'cumstance that supports an opinion that we have elsewhere

expressed, that there is a very considerable resemblance between the Crustacea

of the South-American coast and that of the British seas.

This species, Galathea hamffica (Munida rondeletri, BeU), is stated to be one

of the rarest of our Crustacea, and is seldom to be met with in our museums.

Its habitat is most probably the temperate latitudes in tolerably deep water

on the western shores of Europe ; for although extending as far as the Shet-

lands, yet the specimens that have been dredged in the colder regions are,

we believe, invariably very small and the inhabitants of very deep water.
   Among the Galathece that we have taken on our coast, and which embrace

all that have been previously known as British, is one that we think must be

accepted as not having been previously described.

The largest specimen, measuring from the extremity of the tail to that of

the extended hands, is little more than two inches, of which the animal

itself, measuring from the extremity of the rostrum to that of the taU, is

little more than one inch. This species differs from either of the others in

having the large pair of chelate pereiopoda flat and broad, the fingers much

curved, very distant, and meeting only at their apex when closed, furnished

on the inside mth a considerable brush of hairs, and armed near the base of

the moveable finger with a prominent tubercle or tooth, but which appears

to be of little importance, since it is not able to impinge against the ojDposite

finger. "VVo have sometimes thought that this specimen may only be an

extreme form of the male  of Galathea squamifera                                                                                                                    but  the armature of  the
                                                                                                                                                                 ;

surface of the hands, which is generally a safe guide in specific character,

has a distinct variation. In G. squamifera the arms are covered generally

with a series of curved scale-like tuberculations, the anterior margin of

which is divided into a series of bead-like elevations, while in the most

typical parts, such as on the surface of the meros and carpus, the central

prominence is elevated to a point, and the whole of the tubercular ridge is

crowned by a row of short hairs so minute that they arc not perceptible ex-

cept by the assistance of a lens. These tuberculations are closely packed and

regular.

In the supposed new species the tuberculations are less prominent and

defined, the margins of which can only be perceived to be at all baccatcd by

careful arrangement of the light, while the cilia, being far less numerous, are

yet more conspicuous under the lens. If it be only a variation of G. squami-

fera, as we are much inclined stiU to consider it, it is too important a

variation to be passed over without notice, and the Eeporter has named it

provisionally Galathea digitidistans, until the observation of a larger series

of specimens than we have as yet seen may enable us to arrive at a correct

conclusion.

The zoe of the genus Porcellana has, we believe, been figured from exotic

species by Dana ; and having the opportunity of observing that of P. x^laty-
280 KEPORT--1867.

cheles, we have taken advantage of the circumstance (PI. T. fig. 4). It differs
from the recognized typical zoe of the common shore-crab (Carciniis mcenas')

in the monstrous development of an anterior and two posterior coniuoiis pro-
cesses to the carapace, and in the formation of the telson ; but in its complete
character it offers an intermediate condition between the larvae of the bra-
chyurous and macrurous Crustacea. It has the appendages of the cephalon
and pereion developed to a similar extent with those of the Brachyura,
whereas the telson and carapace bear a nearer resemblance to the same parts
in the Macrura, from which they differ in degree only. In the carapace,
instead of the rostrum and the posterior angles of the carapace being only
just pronounced, as in the macrurous zoe, they are developed to a larger ex-
tent in the anomurous larva?, and in the young of the PorceJlam^ to nearly
twice or three times the length of the animal ; while the telson, instead of
being shaped like the caudal fin of a fish, has in the Anomura the central
portion sometimes produced to an angle posteriorly.

   Beyond this stage of the development of this species, or, we believe, any
species of the Anomura, we have no siire knowledge, except that which we

stated in the last Report relative to the genus Glaucothoe being a stage in the
development of the genus Par/urns.

   The zoe of Pagnrus (PI. I. fig. 1) is probably tolerably well known to car-
cinologists, but we are not aware of its having been figured or described. It

has the anomurous character of having a pointed rostrum and a projecting
point at each of the posterior angles of the carapace, and the telson termi-
nating in a gradually widening fishtail-like appendage, fringed with a few

--terminal spines the appendages being developed rather on the type of those

of the Brachyura than of the Macrura. During our expeditions we have
taken specimens that we believe to be the zoe of the same genus still further
developed ; we say believe to be, because it is only from analysis that we have
come to this conclusion, and we have not the testimony of direct observation

that the one is the older stage of the other.

   That which we take to be the second stage of the genus Pagurus (PI. I.
fig. 2) we took, in the latter end of May, in a towing-net, in Plymouth Sound.
Prom its general appearance our first impression was that it was the young of

& Palcfmon ; but closer observation and a careful dissection of its parts induce

--lis strongly to believe that it is the young of one of the anomurous group

of Crustacea, in the first place the form of the carapace, in the next the
general divergence from and the resemblance to the appendages of the zoe of
a macrurous decapod. The superior antenna is developed upon the brachy-
urous type, but the inferior has the squamiform appendage of the macrurous
Crustacea. All the other appendages that pertain to the cephalon and pereion,
except the last pair of pereiopoda (and these are not developed, at least they

--were not perceptible to oiir examination), have the macrurous type a cir-

cumstance tliat would accord with the animal being that of an luideveloped
anomurous crustacean. The plcon and its appendages bear a very close resem-
blance to those of the larva of a prawn, since it is cquilaterally developed and
furnished with a pair of appendages, posteriorly and vcntraUy, attached to each

somite, the last of which is much larger than the others, and is evidently a
progressive stage in the development of the great caudal plates of the macni-

rous Crustacea.

  We attribute it to the geniis Pagmnis rather than to any of our other

anomurous Crustacea, because it differs from the known zoe of Porcellana,
and of that of Galatlxca wo have no knowledge ; but from the nearer

approach of these last genera to each other in their adult stage than to
SOUTH DEVON AND COHNWALL MAEINE FAUNA AND FLORA. 281

Pagurus, we are inclined to believe in a near resemblauce of their larvae.

Hence onr assumption that this present immature species is a young Pagurus.

The next stage (PL I. fig. 3) to which we allude is one that we noticed

in our preliminary Heport to this Association.

   The animal is a small creature that we took floating near the siirface of
the sea in a warm day in June. Its general appearance is that of a j'oung

maerurous crustacean ; and as such has been classified near to CaUianassa and

Calliadina. It is symmetrical, except in the larger development of the great

chela of the right side. The two succeeding pereiopoda are very long, but

simple, in their formation. The last two are considerably reduced in size ; and

the anterior terminates in a small imperfectly didactyle forceps ; and the pos-

terior has a copious brush, consisting of cilia and short and broad spines,

amongst which the short obtuse and spinous dactylos is discernible. The

pleon is well developed, having each somite clearly defined, and all, except

the first, carrying an equally developed pair of appendages, each of which

consists of a peduncle and two unequal rami. The posterior pair, or uropoda,

differ from the others in having the peduncle shorter, and the outer ramus

longer and more robust ; it is likewise, in the older specimens, curved slightly

more on the left side than on the right.

In this condition they probably continue untU they find a suitable molluscous

Weshell in which to reside.    imagine that they may continue to cast their

exuvia and grow according to the length of time that they are deficient of such
shell, because we have taken specimens occupants of shells that are stiU smaller

than the one described, and yet further advanced to maturity. It would be

curious to see if, when deprived entirely of the use of a shell for a habitat,

--they shoiild continue to grow and retain the normal form of the pleon gene-

rally a feature that characterizes some of the exotic closely allied genera.

Thus a careful examination of numerous specimens has enabled us to

demonstrate the progressive development of the genus Pagun(S, and to affirm

with much confidence, judging by the descriptions and figure of the authors,

that the genera Ghucothoe of M. -Edwards, and Prophylax of LatreiUe, are

none other  than  an immature  stage of   the  genus Pagurus                                                                              but since  their
                                                                                                                                       ;

specimens were exotic, they were probably the yoimg of some foreign species.

Amongst the maerurous Crustacea, we have had the opportunity of exa-

mining and figuring the larva of Palinurvs (PI. II. fig. 2). The young of this

genus was first made known to this Association by the late Mr. E. Q. Couch

of Penzance, at the Meeting at Dublin in 18-57, when he drew attention to the

near resemblance existing between it and the genus Phjlhsoma. In ] 864-65
M. Gerbe (see the ' Comptes Eendus ') repeated the discovery of Mr. Couch,
and asserts that the larva of PaVmurus is identical with the genus Phyllosoma.

   The larva of most of the decapod Crustacea has the largest amount of deve-
lopment, commencing with the cephalon and the pleon ; whilst in the larva
of the Palimirus the greatest advancement exists in the anterior part of the
cephalon and in the pereion, whereas the pleon is almost rudimentary.

   On comparing it with the genus Phyllosoma (PI. II. fig. 1), as M. Gerbe

has done, there is little in the general structure of the animals that can war-

rant a separation of the two, or that might not be accounted for by an

increasing development of the younger specimens. Yet there are certain

points that weigh heavily in the balance of evidence against the larva of Pa-

linurus and Phyllosoma being but different stages of the same animal :

(1) It is contrary to our experience that so small an amount of progressive

development shall have taken place in an animal that has increased in

Wegrowth to about thirty times its size.  generally perceive in the develop-

ment of Crustacea that the most important changes are those that imme-
--282 REPORT 1867.

diately succeed the birth of the larva. (2) The most certain mark by which
a young animal may be known is the immature condition of the antennaj,

more especially the iiageUa ; now, whilst in the larva of the FaJinunis they

are very rudimentary, in Phylhsoma they assume an adult character, and, in

the second pair, one that is of a peculiar feature, at least in the species to

^^hich we refer. (3) The oral appendages appear to be present, though

only as the germs of the future parts, whilst in PhijUosoma they appear to

exist in a rudimentary condition that assimilates little to a progressive stage.

(4) Double branchial vesicles are attached to the coxae of each pair of
pereiopoda, whUst none exist in the larva of PaVinurus. "VVe must admit,

however, that this argument is not very strong, seeing that in the adult

Palinurus branchial organs are present, and that there must be a period

when they first appear; and it is most probable that their earliest stage
is of the most simple character. And perhaps we should not have thought
it sufhciently important to have remarked upon, had not M. Gerbe stated
that PhyUosoma, like the larva of Palinurus, was Avithout branchial appen-

dages ; and M. M.-Edwards remarked that these vesicular aj)pendages are

vestiges of the external branch of the limbs. (5) Phi/Uosoma is a tropical

genus, and with such we can only compare the larva of Pal'umnis ; two

--specimens only of the former have been obtained in the British seas, whereas

Pcdinurus is very common on our coasts an argument that might be very
forcible were we not cognizant of the fact that we are quite as much, if not
more, in the dark in relation to the development of the common lobster.

Our ignorance upon these interesting and important points in the history

of the Crustacea, together with the discovery of Pritz MiiUer, that the larva

of Peneus, and probably that of some other prawns, very closely resembles

that of the cirripedes and other entomostracous larvaj, shows that there is

much yet to be done of far more interest to zoological science than the mere
discovery of new species to be added to our fauna. The great diversity of

structure and the wonderful variation in the development of animals that

possess a great similarity in their adult condition indicate that carcfid study

of these animals will probably assist in thi'owing considerable light on some

of the more profound problems of biological knowledge.

Several specimens of ScijUams arctus have been taken recently on our

coasts. It is some years since Mr. Couch announced the fii'st appearance of

this as a British species ; and none has since been recorded until these last

two years, when several have been taken near Penzance by Mr. Cornish, and

one off the Mewstonc, near the eastern entrance of Plymouth Sound ; two

of these were furnished with spawn, and two were found in the stomach of

a cod-fish. That which we obtained off the Mewstonc was four inches and

a half long, and one of the most interesting additions to our local fauna.
This length is half as long again as that recorded by M. Milne-Edwards

of the Mediterranean specimens.

   In the dredging list published by this Association, the common lobster of

Europe is called Astacus gammarus (L.), rnarinus (Pabr.), and Homarus vul-

garis (M.-Edwards). But since the desciiptions of Linnajiis of Crustacea are so
very general, and the specific name used by him has been long closely associ-
ated with that of a very distinct genus, we think that of Pabiicius (the

next in succession) should be adopted. Again, the generic name given by

Pabricius, Astacus, although prior to all others, yet included the freshwater

genus, with which it is so -closely associated that it would be inconvenient

Weto make an exchange.  therefore propose, in accordance with the rules

laid down by this Association, to retain the generic name of M. M.-Edwards

and the specific name of Pabricius, and call it Homarus marlnus (Pabr.),
         SOUTH DEVON AND CORNWALL MARINE FAUNA AND FLORA. 283

   AVo eanuot turu away from this species without noticing the manner in
which the process of repair is carried on in the development of a new
flagellum to the inferior paii- of antenna. Mr. Lloyd, Conservator of the

Marine Zoological Collection at Hamburg, to whom the reporter is indebted

for the preparation from which fig, 4 in Plate III. is taken, -writes to us,
" The animal lost the antenna by accident, just where the jiincture with the
peduncle takes place ; and then the antenna began to grow in a spiral case,
the spiral growing larger and iacreasing the number of its turns as it grew
older, but never getting hard or coloured. "When the entu'e exuviation of
the lobster took place (in about foui- months after the antenna was broken
off), the antenna was di-awn out of its special case and came forth straight,
the spiral skin retaining its shape. Hardening of the antenna does not take
place (or at least it does not appear hard) tdl after exuviation ; and in like
manner the limbs of aU the lobsters here which renew their limbs."

   A specimen of the genus Axius was taken by Mr. Couch off Polperro, and

described by him as new in the ' Zoologist,' pp. 52-82, 1856 ; but we are not

aware that it has been since met with.

   We have taken what we beheve to be specimens of Crangonfasciatiis and CV.

scuJjJtus ; and a careful comparison of them Avith the descriptions and figures
of the authors has failed to convince us that they are not more or less spinous
varieties of the same species ; and in character they agree so well with the
description of Crangon boreas (Phipps) that it is difficult to believe that they

are not depauperized specimens of that large arctic species.

    Several specimens of Alpheus ruber have been taken on shelly ground off

--the Dodman, and from the same locahty two other specimens of A. edwurdsii,

(PI. III. fig. 2) which we beheve is the first time that this latter species has
been recorded as British. "We had them alive for several days. Their colour

 is a brdliant crimson red, A. ruber being rather paler and more banded
 than A. edwardsii. One peculiar and interesting feature in the structure of
 this animal is the alteration of the character of that portion of the carapace

that covers and protects the organs of vision ; this, which is due not so much

 to the anterior development of the carapace as it is to the eyes having re-
 ceded beneath it, is so changed that, while it offers protection to the organs
 of vision, yet it has become so transparent that it is only by close and careful
 examuiation that, in the hving state, the relation of the two parts to each
 other can be distingiiished.

    The next genus to whicli wo have to allude is one that is new to our
 fauna. It was first described under the name of Tiipton by Costa, from

 species taken at Naples as far back as 1844 (Annali dell' Acad. degU Aspir.
 Mat. di Nap. ii.), by Grube (Ein Ausflug nach Triest und dem Quarnero, pp.
 Go and 125), and in 1856 by Heller under the name of Pontonella (Verhand-
 lungen des zool.-bot. Yereins in Wien, p. 627, Tafel ix. figs. 1-15).

     The British species differs in several points of detail from the figure of the
 Mediterranean species given by Heller in his ' Crustaceen des siidlichenEm'opa.'

 We have therefore considered it a distinct species, and have named it

     TyptOH spongiosum, of which the following is a short description :

  --Gen. CH.A.E. Cai'apace short and deep, covering the entire pereion. Pleon twice

        as long as the carapace, with the lateral walls deep. Eyes prominent, not
         concealed under the carapace, superior antenna having a secondary branch.
        First pair of pereiopoda equal, slender, long, and chelate. Second pair large,

    --in general the right much larger than the left.

    Spec. Chab. Carapace liaving a short, simple rostrum. Eye longer tliau the

         rostrum. Anterior antennse with the secondary appendage longer than the

        primary; posterior antennas havmg the squamiform plate of the third joint
 284 KEPORT-- 1867.

         small, pointed, and not ciliated. Second pair of pereiopoda having the pro-
         podos as long and nearly as broad as the carapace. Dactylos of the right
         hand with the cutting margin convex and simple, on the left hand less convex
         and cuneated. Posterior pair of pleopoda with the posterior external angle of
         the outer ramus dentated, the inner tooth being the longest. Telson armed
         with four lateral dorsal spines, and tipped with a few spines and hairs.

     "We have taken several specimens of Nilri ; and from their general resem-
  blance to N. coucMi, while possessing the channelled telson of N. edulis, so

 particularly pointed out by Bell as a specific distinctive test, we are much

  inclined to believe that there is but a single British species yet knovra,

 and that N. couc?ui is but a variety of N. edulis, Eisso. An examination of

 its parts in detail has shown us that the mandibula (PI. III. fig. 3) is formed
 on a plan that nearer associates the genus with that of Crangon than with
 Alpheus, in the family of which, the latter being the type (Alpheid^), Nilca

 is placed by M. -Edwards and Bell, while Dana, more correctly we think, has

 placed it in a subfamily of the CRANGONiniE, the Ltsmatin^.

    Two or three specimens of Athanas nitescetis have been taken off Polperro.

     Hippohjte barleei, which was described by us from a Shetland specimen
 several years ago, must, we think, be expunged from the list of species, since,
 as pointed out by the Rev. A. M. Norman some time since, it is only an
 accidental variety of IT. cranchii. Our observations of the Stomapoda have
 been limited to a few of the commoner species ; whether this arises from the
 species not being abundant on our southern shores as compared with those
 on the northern, or from accidental causes, attributable to our collecting-

 arrangements, is yet to be determined.

    Amongst the smaller'crustacea there is little to which we should wish to draw
special attention, except that we have recently taken what may prove to be
 an undescribed Antlmra, and to some observations on the structure of Tanais.

    In 1861 Van Bcneden asserted that the proper place of the genus Tanais
was near to that of the family of the Diastiflidcr, because the cephalon was
developed upon the type of the carapace of the Decapoda. In 1864 this
opinion was followed by Dr. Fritz Miiller, who stated that though he had

been unable to identify branchial appendages, yet he felt assured that it
possessed rudimentary organs, because he had observed a current of water
playing from beneath the carapace. Eecently having obtained some living

specimens, we have been able to support Dr. Pritz MiiUer's conclusion relative
to the current of water ; for by the assistance of transmitted light we have

been able through the walls of the carapace to see the branchial appendage

waving to and fro ; we have since dissected out the organ, a drawing of
which accompanies this Eeport (Plate III. fig. 5, 7().

  -- --EcHiNODEKMATA. Mr. Couch, reporting on the Echinodermata, says : "We

have taken Ecliinus sphcera, E. miliaris, Echinociiamus pusillus, Spatangus
purpureus, Ampliidotus o'oseus, small examples of Palmipes memhranaeeus,
Astenas aurantiaca, A. glacialis, Porania pidvillea (by far the most beautiful,
in splendour and variety of colour, of all our native starfishes, and also the
scarcest; the colours are liable to variation in diff'erent individuals), Luidia
fragilissima, Ophiocoma Jilifonnis.

   There was a time when the flexible species of corals were in abundance on
the rather hard and what fishermen, from its being free from large stones

and rocks, term clean ground ; but this for the most part has been swept
doubly clean by trawling; and the shelter of these corals and the lower
animals Avhich grew among them, which in\'ited fish to seek it for spawning,
and also afi'orded refuge especially to the young fish, is destroyed, on which

account very little of these corals was seen. From a fisherman's hook, how-

 ever, in rather shallower water, was obtained a large example of the species
 named, in the Journal of the Zoological Society, by Dr. J. E. Gray, lihodo-
 phyton couchii, the second that has been met with, more fleshy than the

 former, and now also deposited in the British Museum. An incrusting

 Alcyonium was also found, which took the form, in its contorted windings,
 of the slender substance that passed through and supported it. Added to
 these, we dredged np Cellepora ramulosa, and what I believed to be C.
 laevigata ; but having sent the specimen to our lamented friend the late
 Joseph Alder, he hesitated to decide regarding it.

  --Spokges. The sponges were not the least interesting of the objects that we

--have obtained and so much the rather as oiu" observations on them have had

 the advantage of the assistance of Dr. Bowerbauk, to whom specimens of all
 were submitted for his opinion. Among the sponges examined by Dr.

 Bowerbank, we have to congratulate oiu'selves on the acquisition of two
 which that naturalist pronounces new to science and the first as such which

 he has seen since the publication of his Treatise on this department of Natu-
 ral History by the Ray Society.

    These examples, of course, remain with Dr. Bowerbank, who has done
 Mr. Couch the honour to name the first of them Halichondria couchii. Of
 these we annex the author's descriptions.

were otlier hermit crabs ; but in tlicso instances there was not a shell on which
the sponge had iucrusted itself, I can scarcely imagine how a shell can
have disappeared after having been thiis incriistcd ; and it is difficiilt also
to imagine how, without a solid support, this sponge could have formed itself
into a baU round the crab (which had a defined cavity within) as we find it
to have done*.

   Hispida dictyocylindnis, H. Eowerbank. There is something remarkable
in the circumstances which have attended the dredging of this species, and
which I can explain only by su^iposing that two species are confounded

together, which on the other hand I am assured, on high authority, is not

the case. Thus, in spaces or districts at the depth of about twenty, and
again in forty fathoms, there came up examples of this slender, branched
sponge, measuring, some of them, a foot in length, with the surface truly
hirsute, and which had been fixed to the ground by a well-marked and
rather broad root. But at other places and in deeper water, there clearly

had never been, of any one of the many examples obtained, an attachment

to the ground; and the branching growth proceeded from both ends, with an
intermediate space, not always in the middle, of from one to two or three
inches in length, and which appeared to be that middle Line or stem from
which the branches at each end derived support, but which had not even a
slight mark of a root or point of attachment. Secondary branches are at

least rare, if they occur at all in this (variety) ; and its surface has a much
finer grain than is common on the rooted examples. Some of these speci-
mens at least appear to have lain along the ground ; but in a single instance
one of the ends must have been erect, since on it was growing, parallel with

it, a flexible coral and two examples of FolUcipes scaJpdlum. In one instance
 also a fine specimen of Graniia dliata had become fixed on a prostrate branch

and of another, of small size, now in the possession of Dr. Eowerbank,
with three liranches at each end of a short middle stem, it was the opinion

 of that gentleman that two examples had been brought into contact with
 each other and had thus become united ; but on examination I was not able
 to discern any such mark of union, and of a root or footstalk there was no

 appearance.
     Other species of sponge obtained in these dredgings are : Ilalichondria

ficus, named by my late friend Joshua Alder, from sixty fathoms ; Desma-

 cidon fruticosa, Eowerbank ; Hymcniacidon vm/idtosa, Eowerb., near the
 land at Lantwit Bay ; Dysidea fragilis, Johnston ; Grantia compressa
 G. Jistulosa, Johnst. ; Leuconia JisHdosa, Eowerb. ; G. ciliata ; G. lacunosa,
 Johnst. ; Lcucosolenia, Eowerb., in shallow Avater, on the carapace of the
 Corwich crab ; Aniouraciwn prolifermn and A. lave, from rocks in Lantwit
 Bay.

    Of a large abundance of Annelids wc are not able to give an account, but
 they have been placed in safe hands, examples having been sent to the Ee-
 portert and to the British Musonm. What appear to be three species of
 Aphrodyte have afforded mc figures. Folynoc sqvamaUi, Oanis hnmnevs, and
 two or three species of Sipvnndus derive their interest in our labours from a

  knowledge of the depth of water and distance from land in which they live.

Supplement to a Report on the Extinct Didine Birds of the Mascarene

   Islands. By Alfred NewtoNj M.A., F.L.S., Professor of Zoology

    in the University of Cambridye.

In 1865, at Birmingham, a Committee was appointed to assist the author's
brother, Mr. Edward Newton, Auditor General of Mauritius, in his researches

into the Didine Bii-ds of the Mascarene Islands. Last year, at Nottingham,
the Committee reported ; but their Eeport, printed in the Annual Yolume of

the Association for 1866 (p. 401), was in one respect very unsatisfactory ; it

could only speak of promise, not of performance. Indeed almost the sole

feat it could recount was the having drawn the money granted. The powers
of the Committee, however, being now ended, the only thing left was to show
that they had been properly applied, and this was best done by exhibiting a
selection from the large series of bones of the Didine Birds of the island of
Eodriguez, which had been collected by labourers sent expressly to that island
by Mr. Edward Newton in the autumn of 1866, as stated in the Eeport of

the Committee. It had been formerly shown by the late lamented Hugh
Edwin Strickland (The Dodo and its Kindred, p. 46) that this bird, PezopTiaps

solitaria (Gmel.), was Didine in its affinities, though genericaUy separable
from the true Dodo, Dklus ineptus, Linn. This conclusion, though originally
arrived at on very slight evidence, was now shown to be completely correct,
and the establishment of the genus Pezophaps is proved to have been fully
justified by the examination of the almost complete series of bones obtained
by Mr. Edward Newton. On some of the peculiarities presented by these
bones the author dwelt slightly, but in particular on an tmexpected confirma-

tion of the evidence of Leguat, by the discovery of an extraordinary bony
knob near the extremity of the wing. Leguat, whose aceountf of the liabits

of the Solitaire was the only one we possessed, mentioned that " I'os de

railcron grossit a rextremitc, et forme sous la plume une petite masse ronde

comme une baUo de mousquet." Now the existence of this " mas.se ronde "

was proved by the bony knobs attached to several metacarpal bones exhibited
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

and thus the veracity of Leguat was established on this point, as it had been
on so many others. In conclusion, the author stated that at present we know
little more of tlio Didine Bird of the Island of Eeuuion than that it was nearly
wliite. In the course of last year Mr. Tegetmeier had shown him an old

Report on Observations of Luminous Meteors, 1866-67. By a Committee,

   consisting of James Glaisher, F.R.S., of the Royal Observatory
   Greenwich, President of the Royal Mici'oscopical and Meteorolo-

  gical Societies, Robert P. Greg, F.G.S., E. W. Brayley, F.R.S.,

   Alexander S. Herschel, F.R.A. S., and Charles Brooke, F.R.S.,

    Secretary to the Meteorological Society.

The object of collecting observations of Luminous Meteors to serve as a basis

of reference for calculations, and pointing out whatever conclusions may be

drawn from them, is kept in view by the Committee, in presenting with this

Report a continuation of the Catalogue of former years.

   The apparent places of the meteors are given either (most conveniently) by

+ --their right ascensions (a) and declinations (o, north, and south), by the

weU-known method of their aUineations with certain neighbouring stars, or

(in some cases of, generally speaking, less accurate approximations) by their

apparent azimuths and altitudes with respect to the visible horizon.

  A large proportion of the descriptions contained in the present Catalogue

refer to great meteors recorded on the morning of the 14th of November,

A1866.  long list of meteors of a less striking description than those se-

lected for entry in the Catalogue, noted on tlie same morning, was received

by the Committee from observers, whose reports on the jiarticular phenomena

of the shower are noticed, Avith more or less detaQ, in the fourth Appendix

of the Catalogue.

The gi'eatest multitude of the meteors on the morning of the 14th of No-

vember made their appearance exactly during the hour from one to two

o'clock A.M., which was the hour appointed beforehand by the Committee,

with a view to secure the cooperation of observers, for making simultaneous

observations of the shower.

One meteor during the hour was simultaneously recorded at Sidmouth, at

Cardiff, and at Strettou, Hereford ; and the length of the terminal portion of

its phosphorescent streak, which remained visible for ten minutes, was found

to be eighteen miles (Appendix 1.).
   The heights of three other meteors of the November shower were satisfac-

torily foimd. One, which left a remarkably persistent luminous streak over

the town of Dundee, was from 51 to 57 miles above the earth's surface.

One meteor also, on the 10th of Augiist last, was simultaneously obsei-ved

at London and at Birmingham. This disappeared at a height of 76 miles

above the neighbourhood of Bristol.

The supposed region of the true radiant-point of many of the individual

meteors in the Catalogue is indicated by the observers. Excellent means

are thus afforded for distinguishing the obvious peculiarities of light and

motion which characterize meteors from particular radiant-points. To assist

observers in this inquiry, all the observations hitherto entered in the Cata-

logue are mapped on a series of charts, the first four maps of which series
are now lithographed, and 25 impressions are presented to the British Asso-

ciation with this Report.

The position of each radiant-point amongst the constellations is conspi-

cuously entered upon the maps, with its annual dates of maximum, and dura-
       A CATALOGUE OF OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS, 289

tion ; and upon the same chart the meteor-tracks proceeding from the parti-
cular radiant-point are denoted by such plain signs as to indicate directly

the particular radiant-point with which they are connected.

In the case of the best-established star-showers, the meteor-tracks engraved

upon the maps will generally be found to tell beforehand the course which

meteors appearing at any part of the sky from one of those radiant-points

will pursue across the sky, like wires stretched for the meteors to run upon

(to use the words of one observer of the November shower last year).

In other cases, where the position of the radiant-point is not yet so well

established, its printed place must be regarded as provisional and as reqiiiring

Afurther confirmation by observations to decide its real place.                         copy of one

of the first four maps exhibited, showing the radiant-point of the November

meteors, as observed at the Eoyal Observatory, Greenwich, will be fovmd in

the fourth Appendix of the Catalogue. The three other plates refer to the
special radiant-points in January, August, and October. The whole series

will be in readiness to distribute to observers this year before the reap-

pearance, as anticipated, of the great star-shower on the morning of the

14th of November next.

   If the space of the Committee has been taxed to secure insertion in the

Catalogue for the multitudinous observations of meteors of the 14th of No-

vember last*, it is much more difficult to represent adequately more than

twenty French, and about as many German descriptions of a large detonating

fireball seen by daylight in the north of France on the 11th of June last,

which the Committee have received. The luminous streak left by the meteor

was visible, at many places, for more than an hour after the first appearance

of the meteor, and exhibited unusual contortions. Its occurrence very near

the date of the 9th of June, marked last year by the prodigious stonefall of

Knyahinya, and in the present year by the fall of three aerohtes atTadjera,

in Algeria, is pointed out, in Appendix II. and III., as probably connecting

these three extraordinary occurrences together in a single aerolitic period.

At the end of the Eeport is placed an addition to the Catalogue of large

meteors and aerolites, by Mr. E. P. Greg, in continuation of that printed in

the    volume  of Reports  for  the  year  1860                          supplying the  omissions,  and
                                                                      ;

bringing up the date of that Catalogue to the present time. It will, it is

believed, be found a perfect repertory of this kind of meteoric occurrences,

for the possession of which the British Association will congratulate itself.

   Abstracts of a number of important papers on the subject of shower-

meteors are deferred until a time when the maximum display of the Novem-

ber star-shower will probably have been observed in America in November,

1867, and the spectacle, in that case, will probably give rise to a new discussion

on the subjects of which they treat. Some recent papers by M. Daubree, on

the synthesis and classification of meteorites, will also then be reviewed.

Approaching hours of daylight will probably deprive observers in the

British Isles of aU participation in the specially interesting display of the

November meteors in the current year, although the stage of the gradual

commencement of the shower will be better observed in England than in

America. It was thus that the August meteors, this year, were nearly in-

visible, from the hoirrs of daylight appearing in England ; but according to an
American account contained in Appendix IV., they were visible there " in

countless numbers" soon after midnight, on the night of the 10th of August

last.

   * The Gri-eenwich obseitations of meteors "which hitherto have appeared in these Cata-
logues, will in future be printed in the volumes of the Greenwich Magnetical and Meteoro-

logical Observations for their respective years.                                        X

Observatious of Meteors made at the Cambridge Observatory between No-
   vember 13th, 11" 30'" and November 13th, 14" 15"', in the year 1866. By

    Professor Ch.\llis.

   The observations were made by means of a small wooden meteoroscope on a tripod

stand, furnished with a straight bar about 21 inches long, and readily moveable in
altitude and azimuth. The mo-\euieut in altitude carried a graduated arc which
was read off by an index partaking- of the azimuth motion. The movement in
azimuth canied a horizontal graduated circle read oil' by an index fixed to the tiipod
stand. I marked the Hues of graduation roughly to integi-al degi-ees for use on this
occasion. In taking an observation, the bai- was pointed by hand to the place of
the meteor, the eye looking along the sti-aight edge. The point selected for obser-
vation was sometimes the middle of the course, but more generally the end of it.

At the instant of seeing the meteor I called out "now," and Mr. Todd, the Junior

Assistant at the Observatory, gave the time from a mean-time chronometer from
which he was ccunting to himself I then took the altitude- and azimuth-readings,

which, with the time and the other circumstances, were recorded by H. Wilberforce

Clai-ke, Esq., E.E., of Chatham. The direction of flight was estimated by con-
ceiving- the face of a watch to be projected on the heavens, its centre coincidino-
with the obsen-ed place of the meteor, and the hour XII pointing- towards the
zenith. The meteor's course was in the direction from the centre of"the watch to-

wards the recorded liour. Xo especial care was taken to place the axis of motion

of the meteoroscope in a vertical position, but I had previously adjusted the leng-ths

of the legs of the stand so that if it were placed on a horizontal plane the axis

would be very nearly vertical. From time to time altitude and azimuth observa-

tions were taken of stars, for the purpose of obtaining- data for calculating- the error

of position of the axis. The stand was placed on the flat roof of a small out-

building-, covered somewhat imeveuly with lead, and not being attached to the roof
and being of light weight, it was liable to be shaken and displaced. I have reason

to say that in consequence of accidental disturbance, it did not retain exactly the

same position during the whole of the observations. With regard to magnitude,

the iiieteors are divided into three classes caUed o, /3, and y. Those of class a were

a.s blight as stars of the first magnitude, and a few as bright as Venus when brightest.
The class /S were of the second or third magnitude ; and the class y were compara-

tively faint, but not smaller than fifth-magnitude srars. The letter T iu the sub-

joined list indicates that the meteor had a train, which was the case with by far

the greater number. Observations were made at tlie same time and place with

another meteoroscope by Professor Adams and his Senior Assistant Mr. Graham,
and it was agreed to divide the heavens into the northern and southern halves. As

myI took the northern half,  observations are principally iu that portion, the ex-

ceptions occurring in the earlier and later obsenatious, and when the north quarter

was nearly covered with clouds, (See Table, pp. 304, .3(15.)

                 Notes explanatory' of the Calculations.

   The chronometer was 2"" 51'"'82 fast on Observatorv Mean Time at November
13th, 11" 28"", and 2TM o2-.3o fast at November 13th, 16'' 49"'. Hence as the Ob-

servatory is 22''7'5 east of Clreenwich, 3"" 1.5* has been subtracted from each of the

chronometer times to calculate the Greenwich Mean Time to the nearest second.

AThe azimuths are reckoned from the N. point through E. to 360'. Let represent

the azimuth-reading, and z the zenith-distance reading for any star, and let a and f
be its true azimuth and zenith distance calculated from its Iniown II. A. and N. P. D.,
the colatitude of the Obser's atory being 37"^ 47', and the longitude east 22*-75. Also
suppose the axis of the instrument to have inclined by the arc .r from the zenith

mtowards the south, and by tlie arc y from the zenith towards the east. Then if

be the index-correction of the zenith-distance readings, and fi the index-correction

of the azimuth-readings, we liave the following equations :

                      --C Z=:wi X cos a-\-;/ sin a,

                   --a A=?)+ cot f (z sin a+y cos a).

   The values of A, Z, a and 90°-- f are given in the foregoing Table. By using

these values, two equations were derived from each of the observations of stars.
It should, however, be stated that, instead of using the recorded value of z, I have
adopted in each instance a value f/reater by one-fourth of a degree, having found
by experiment that the eye was almost necessarily elevated a little above the end
of the bar in order to see the opposite end in coincidence with the object. The
experiments gave a difference of pointing equal to about 15'. Also the small cor-
rection required for refraction has been taken into account to the nearest minute.
In this manner the follo^ving equations were obtained for determining the values of
7H, n, X and »/ :

   Any displacement of the stand would be likely to exhibit itself in discordances

--of the values of a -- A, rather than iu discordant values of f Z.' The above values

Aa--of .'ihow that there was no azimuthal change sufficient to affect the values of

.r and i/, but that there may have been small changes of tlie index-coiTection n.

These changes, must, however, have been too small to ha\e any perceptible effect

--on the values of f Z. As there was an inter\-al of only three minutes between Nos.

1 and .3, it may be assumed that for these observations both ni and n had the same

mvalues. Accordingly, after eliraii-atiug and n from the equations (1), (2), (8) and

bably made in reading off or recording.

(9), the resulting two equations have been employed for iiuding- x and i/.  Tlieso

equations are

                                  - 2' = 0-G9o9.r-0-238o//,

                              + 50'=0;3129.r+0-49.13)/,

+which give a-= 26', y=-|-8-i'. As I had no reason to suspect any azimuthal

disturbance of the insti'ument between Nos. 62 and 70, the ii:ter-\-al between tl\eni
being not more than seventeen minutes, I have similarly employed the equations
(6), (7), (13), and (14) for finding .r and i/. The two resulting equations are

                                  - 15' =0-o48ar - 0-3424?/,

                                              -78'=00002.r-0-4755}/,

 which give .r= +70', »/= +105'. These values are not accordant with those ob-
 tained from the other set of equations ; but perhaps the deviations from the mean
 values, which do not exceed 25' in altitude and 40' in azimuth, are not greater than
 what might be expected from the mode of observing and the character of the in-

 =strument. I have therefore adopted the values .f .50', i/=l2o', using 50' instead

 of the exact mean 51' for facility of calculation. I tried other combinations of the

 equations, but found none that gave as probable results as those derived from the
 above values of x and i/.

    Hence the values of n derived from, the equations (8) and (9) arc --52° 57'

 and - 52° .30', the mean of which, --52° 44', is adopted for Nos. 1 to 17 of the series,
 a note having been made that just after No. 17 the stand was disturbed. Tlie

 values of n, similarly derived from the equations (10) to (14), are --5(3° 47', --oo°
 33', -54° 27', -54° 20', and -54° 1'. The two first seem to indicate vmsteadiness
 of the stand, but as their mean does not greatly differ from the mean of all, it was
 thought right to adopt the latter mean, viz. --54° 37', for all the observations after

 No. 17.

   When the same values of a; andy are substituted in the equations (1) to (7), the
mresulting values of are 19° 24', 19° 17', 18° 57', 19° 7', 18° 44', 17° 43', and 17° 43',

--the mean of which is 18° 42'. For verification of this result I also obtained the

index-correction in the following manner : An adjusted spirit-level was placed on

the upper flat side of the bar, find the bar being made to point horizontally by
bringing the bubble into middle position, the altitude-circle was read oft". The same
thing was done after changing the azimuth by 180^. The two readings being 71°
15' and 71° 35', the complement of half their sum is +18° 35', which consequently

is the index-correction. By another trial made in azimuths 90° from the former,

the two readings were 70° 0' and 73° 0', and the index-correction is consequently
+18° 30'. The mean between the two residts, viz. 18° 33', is the adopted value

mof ; this mode of determining it being thought to be more accm'ate than the otlier.

The small difference between this value and -1-18' 42' is considerable confirmation

of the accuracy of tlie adopted values of .r and y. It should be added that in ob-
taining these corrections, the meteoroscope was placed, as nearly as could be con-
jectured after about a month's interval, in the same position that it had during the

observations, and that consequently the values of x and y may be inferred from the
differences of the altitude-readings in the respective positions. The values thus
obtained are a-=-|-10', y=:+90'. As I could not be sure that the meteoroscope in

this trial had exactlj^ the same position as before, I have preferred using the values
of a: and y deduced from the observations of stars.

  ARepresenting now by and Z the azimuth- and zenith-distance readings for the

observation of any meteor, the following equations were employed for calculating

--its true azimuth and altitude as given by the observation :

  +True altitude (/3))==7711°°12'-Z++5500''ccooss((A+H) 125'ssiinn((AA--ll--rt)-rreefraction.

  True azinmth = A+;i+ tan/3 (50' sin (A+k)+125' cos ('A+».))-

   The value of « is --52° 44' for Nos. 1 to 17, and --54° 37' for the remaining Nos.
The constant 71° 12' is 90°- 18° 33'- 15'; the correction -15'' being applied for

gether with their altitudes and azimuths calculated from their known R. A. and

N. P. D., iu order to give the means of judging of the degree of accuracy to be

ascribed to the observations. (The latter are put in braclcets.)

I made au observation of the mean of the positions of tv^^o stationary meteors

(No. 60) soon after the clouds h.ad cleared oti, and before counting from" the chro-

nometer Iiad recommenced. The time was taken roughly by my watch, -w^hicli

was found by subsequent comparison to be seveii minutes slower than the chro-

nometer. The recorded time, 1'' 20'", takes into accoimt this difference. The

time of observing Regidus (No. 51) was not noted ; but as this observation fol-

lowed immediately after No. 50, it was conjectured from other similar cases that

the interval between them v/as about one ininute. Tlie times for Nos. 50 and 51

are, consequently, quite uncertain ; but as the place of Regulus, calculated from

the obsen-ation, agrees well enough with its true place, it is not likely tliat they

are much in error. By calculation of the E. A. and Decl. of the mean stationary

point from the azimuth 83° 24' and the altitude 25° 12', it is found that the R. A.

= =150" 58', and Decl. +23° 36'.

Soon afte^rr seeing the .stationary meteor.", I noted down the mean position with

reference toI neeiigglniDboouurrimng stars, bby maappppimngg the stars and the estimated position

on a piece of paper, from which the annexed diagram

has been transferred by punctures through tlie paper.

(It should be observed that the two meteors had about

the same altitude, and the more northward one was                 f#
much fainter than the other.)

By making use of the star-map in Johnston's ' Atlas

of Astronomy,' I estimated the place of the meteors    e* ^n\ \ Mean posif.ion
                                                                                  ( of thu meteor3.

   This determination I consider to be more trust-
worthy than the other, the R. A. of the former being
probably too much in excess of that of Regulus. If

double weight be given to the second determination

= = +of R. A., and equal vreiglits be given to the declinations, the radiant point comes
out R. A. 149° 39', Decl.  23' 12'.

            (3) 1866, ISiOvember 14tli, 1'^ 8'" a.m. (Cardiff).

The apparent position of the meteor at the beginning and end of its %'isible

path, as referred to the stars by Messrs. A. and J. Thomson at Cardiff, and

Mr. H. S. Heinecken at Sidmouth, are in the most perfect geometrical accord-

ance with the respective geographical positions of the two stations fi-om one

another. As the stations are respectively north and south from one another,

and the meteor passed between them from east to west, the real altitude of

the meteor, and the extent of the luminous streak which it left floating ujion

its path for at least ten minutes before it disappeared, can be determined with

exactness. The direct distance of Sidmouth from Cardiff is just fifty British

statute miles. The parallax of the meteor at its fii-st appearance was 20°,
and corresponds to a height of 100 miles above Petersficld, in Hampshire

(lat. 51° N., long. 0° 55' W. from Greenwich). The meteor disappeared be-

tween the two stations, and its parallax was then 50°. Its real altitude at
the instant of its disappearance was fifty-three miles above Tiverton, in Devon-

shire (lat. 50° 55' N., long. 3° 39' ^\. from Greenwich), which point it reached

after an aerial flight of 120 miles directed exactly from the radiant-point

(near x Leonis) of the IS^ovember meteoric shower, in the centre of Leo's

« Sickle."

At the final distance of the meteor fi-om Cardift', sixteen or eighteen miles

would subtend 15°, which was the length (see Catalogue) of that portion of
the luminous streak which collected itself into a cloud after the nucleus had

Adisappeared.  " few minutes of arc " (sec Catalogue) would correspond to

as many hundred feet at the same distance ; this was accordingly the width

of the straight portion of the luminous streak, while the oval light-cloud,

which remained visible ten minutes, if it subtended the apparent width of

only two diameters of the moon, must have measured at least one mile in

thickness.

              (4) 1866, November 14th, 2'^ 12TM 30^ a.m. (Hawkhurst).

   The apparent position of the meteor, seen at this time to leave a very per-
sistent streak at Hawkhurst, is not compatible with the apparent place of a
very similar meteor observed at very nearly the same moment by Mr. Lowe
at Nottingham, so as to make it possible to compute their distance as if the
meteors were identical. But it is probable that two meteors, nearly simulta-
neous in time, were seen at the two stations in nearly the same quarter of

the heavens.

                    (5) 1866, November 14th, 2'> 14TM a.m. (Glasgow).

   An observation of the meteor seen at Glasgow was also recorded by Mr.

G. Forbes at St. Andrews. It moved, however, with reference to the two
stations, so nearly in a plane containing the base-line drawn between them,
that although a considerable parallax of the kind attributable to their very
wide displacement is perfectly apparent, additional observations at other places

are required to define its real altitude.

            (6) 1866, November 14th, 2'' 40" 58^ (Aberdeen).

A brilliant fireball of the November shower was seen over the whole of.

Scotland and as far south as Nottingham, in England. Observations of its

apparent place were recorded at Sunderland in England, and at Glasgow,
AEdinburgh, and Aberdeen in Scotland (sec next page).
                                                                 comparison^ of

these accounts assigns to the light-cloud left by the meteor near the termination

of its course an altitude of between sixty-one and sixty-seven miles above the

earth's surface in the neighbiu'hood of Dundee. (Proceedings of the Glasgow

Philosophical Society, vol. vi. p. 207.)

         (7) 1867, August 9th, 11" 46" p.m. (London and Birmingham).

   Two bright meteors of the August shower, in almost exactly the same

quarter of the sky, were recorded simultaneously at Birmingham and London
at this hour (see Catalogue). The resemblance between the two meteors is,
however, casual ; for the lines of sight, instead of converging towards each
other very rapidly, as might be expected to take place from the great distance
between the stations if a single meteor were under consideration, actually
diverge from each other to an extent of 5^ or 6°, and evidently point to two
different meteors appearing almost simultaneously in time and in the same
quarter of the sky at either place.

         (8) 1867, August 10th, lO"^ 57"° p.m. (Birmingham and London).

   The two bright meteors simultaneously recorded at this time by strict ob-
servations at Birmingham and London, during a period of jjositive scarcity of

shooting-stars, correspond exactly in their apparent place of disappearance
with the supposition of a large displacement by parallax (of about 45°) in

the direction of a straight line joining Birmingham and London. The iden-
tity of the two meteors must accordingly be regarded as perfectly confirmed,
although the partial view obtained at London permits only the end point, or
point of disappearance, to be fixed. This was at a height of seventy-six miles
above the earth's surface in the ne^i5g^hbourhood of Bristol.

           (1) 1862, April 25th, 8'' 20TM p.m. (local time), Hobart Town,
                                      Yan Diemen's Land.

   The following account of a large meteor seen in the southern hemisphere

appears in the ' Eesults of twenty-five years' Meteorological Observations for
Hobart Town,' by F. Abbot, F.ll.A.S., p. 17. Although appearing in the

southern sky, the meteor belongs to a date when fine meteors ai-e not uncom-
monly seen in considerable numbers in the northern hemisphere ; and it is
frequently the case that meteoric displays are \-isible at the same time in both

the noi'th and south hemispheres of the globe.

   " On the 25th of April 1862, while observing the accompanying cluster

K Crux at 8'' 20" p.m., a remarkably fine meteor crossed the zenith from v in

the constellation of Centaurus, to Nebula Major. By estimation the meteor
was about 1 5' in diameter, traversing about 00^ in four seconds of time, leaving

a long and remarkable train of sparks that continued, from fii\st to last, about
ten minutes, which gradually contracted into an oblong form from 1° to 2° in
diameter, and for a time appeared to station itself a httle to the west of y Crux.

During the time of transit the meteor gave a brilliant illumination, much
more incandescent than that produced by the full moon.''

just in time to see a glare of light which suddenly disappeared, leaving a
luminous patch in the east.
'^ '· Professor Thomson describes it as a brilliant meteor of half the apparent
diameter of the moon, of an intense white light, -which rose due east of our ob-
servatory, apparently from the sea, slowly describing a small semicircle of 3'^
diameter from S. to N., occupying nearly thirty seconds in doing so, and
leaving behind it a faint luminous track, which soon disappeared.

   My" attention at this instant was attracted by a glare of light in the east.

This proceeded from a brilliant ball of a reddish coloiir, fully half the appa-
rent diameter of the moon. which seemed to be rising
from the sea directly under the star e Yirginis. After
attaining an altitude of 8° or 10°, it seemed to arch over
towards the north, describing a semi-circle of about 2°

radius ; when the lower half of the meteor seemed to

shell off, emitting a train of luminous sparks which fell
vertically downwards, completing the arch formed by the
slightly luminous train of the msteor. The accompany-

ing rough sketch is a copy of one made in my notebook

at the time, and represents the meteor when it first
bui'st. The total time of visibility of the meteor may

have been about ten seconds.

   " On my way home, Avhen about half a mile due south of the observatory,
my attention was attracted at this instant by a glare of light. Looking up,

I feared that I had missed some brilliant meteor, when presently, beyond a
housetop close to the east of me, appeared a most billiant meteor moving
nearly horizontally with an apparently slow and diminishing motion. I ran
to the middle of the street, which enabled me to see backwards (eastwards)
along its path (indicated by its train), which appeared to have commenced
somewhere between Mars and Pollux, rather nearer the latter. The nucleus

passed over a Tauri, rested an instant over the little pair of stars in the y,
and disappeared without noise. The path and point of disappearance can be
represented thus (fig. 1).

    " I should estimate the apparent diameter of this meteor as one-fifth that
of the moon. But the intensity of its hght was incomparably greater than
that of any previoiisly observed, and its character more resembled sunlight

than any other.

   "The most remarkable feature of this meteor, however, was the train.
This was of a pale-yellow colour, and at first it remained as a band of dense
nebulous-looking light, about half a diameter of the moon in breadth, along

the path of the meteor, as in 'No. 1.

   " After two minutes the train wound about, and assumed the appearance

of No. 2.
    " After 3| minutes it had collected itself into a nebulous-looking cloud, as

in No. 3, which remained vividly distinct until four minutes (by the watch)

after the appearance of the meteor, when it was obscured by a cloud."

Professor Grant's notes of its appearance at Glasgow refer principally to

the luminous streak, of which a drawing

at the time, by Mi*. Herschcl, is here              ® _.^
appended in illustration of Professor

Grant's description.

   " At 14" 41'", G. M. T., my attention

was directed to an extraoi'chnary blaze          £
of light in the constellation Ursa Ma-

jor. "When first seen it presented tlie
appearance of a slightl_y curved broad ®

band of light, indicative of the train of

a meteor which itself had already dis-        o
appeared, and which, judging from what

was left behind, must have far exceeded

in lustre any of the meteors seen during

the night. The first apparition of this

remarkable phenomenon I unfortunately

lost, having been engaged at the time in writing down some details in

my notebook. It was obvious, however, that the meteor had only just va-

nished, for the residuary mass of light was stiU very bright. I eoidd only

compai-e its appearance in this respect to that presented in a dark night by

the blazing furnace of one of the great iron-Avorks in the neighbourhood of

Glasgow. In less than a minute after it was fiii'st seen it assumed the appear-

ance of a horseshoe, or inverted arch, of diffused nnd rajiidly diminishing

light, one extremity of which was pi-ojected upon eUrsa) Majoris, and the

other iipon y and 2 of the same constellation [No. 1]. Graduallj^it expanded
in dimensions and grew fainter ; at the same time the ai'ch became more

elongated and pointed, suggesting its resemblance to a merry- thought, or the
outline of a heart. At 14'' 48TM the western extremity was stiU attached to

e Ursaj jMajoris, but the eastern had drifted from y and o to a and /3 of the
same constellation [No. 3] ; an effect doubtless attributable to the prevalence
of a westerlj^ wind, which was blowing at the time. The apex was seen

to descend as far as v//TJrsfe Majoris, or perhaps a little lower. This remark-

able object continued to be distinctly visible till 14'^ 5G"'; even at IS*" traces

of it might still be discerned"*.

Professor Piazzi Smyth thus describes the appearance of the train at the

Carlton Hill Observatoiy at Edinburgh :

    " Of bright meteors . . , there must have been oue about 2'' 40"' a.m., bet-n-een
a XJrsa3 Majoris aud a. Ursse Miuoris ; for immediately thereafter the central

l)art of its luminous track was brilliantly conspicuous, like a silver snake in
the sky. From minute to minute the luminous line became more corrugated,
widening and becoming fainter by degrees; and also diifting, apparently
under the action of the north-west wind blowing at the time ; even after a
quarter of an hour the train-matter was still visible, but changed to some-
thing like the outline of a gigantic pear, and drifted some 30° from its first

position."

   At Sunderland, in Durham, Mr. Backhouse obtained a view of the persistent
light-streak, and to his report is added a de-

scription of another meteor, and drawings of

their appearance.

past Polaris, and became extinguished in the neighbourhood of /3 Cephei.

             Extract from the New York ' World,' 24th November.

 --" Meteovolocjical Phenomenon. At Nashville, about four o'clock last Tues-

day morning [tlie 20th of November 1866], a meteor lighting the whole
heavens was seen in the direction of Rome, Ga., moving rapidly south-west.

It appeared like a ball of fire as large as the sun. It exploded apparently
ten miles off with a tremendous report, like a 40-lb. cannon, that shook the

earth and made the windows rattle."

   The " phenomenon," if it actually took place as here described, forms an
addition to the list of detonating meteors happening about the 20th of No-
vember, already enumerated in previous Reports (British Association Report,

1866, p. 125).

   Accounts of this meteor were collected by Professor Ed. Hagenbach-Bis-

choff at Basle, and by M. W. de Fonvielle at Paris. The following description

of its appearance, first ascending vertically and then slightly falling, at Basle
shows that a projection of its course prolonged, would pass nearly through
that town.

   " Basle, June 13th, 1867.--I stood with a telescope on the ' Bruderholz,'

near my house at Madorg, when the meteor made its appearance. As soon

                                                                                                / ti 2

at Basle, by H. Christ.
as it appeared, directly over the middle of the forest, I pointed the telescope

to it and examined therewith the successive changes of the white, somitrans-
parent, faintly luminous cloud which it left for the space of about an hour.

    " Immediately after the disappearance of the nucleus (which rested like a
fixed star at the summit of its course for about half a second, fig. 1) there re-
mained at the spot a small globular cloud (fig. 2) which rapidly extended itself,
as if dissipated by an upward current of air, as in fig. 3.

    " It then took the form of a winding, riband-like, or irregularly spiral curve
(fig. 4), which it preserved for the space of about half an hour, and at last
gradually assumed the cirrus-forms shown in figs. 5 and 6, and disappeared
in the approaching darkness after nine o'clock. The accompanying figures
are exact and careful representations of its successive transformations. One
remarkable feature of the phenomenon was that the originally deposited
small globular cloud of vapour remained visible for a long time, as showai in
figs. 3 and 4, at the basis of the streak." (Eeport of H. Christ to Professor
E. Hagenbach-Bischoff.)

 able Professor Hagenbach to fix the summit of its apparent patb at that place
 at 12|° above the horizon, 45° west from north, in the direction of Dimkirk,
 Oise, Aisne, Meuse, and Marne in the North of Erauce.

     The meteor was seen in daylight at Paris proceeding almost horizontally
 at an altitude of about 22!j°, from 3° west to 34° east of north (Comptes
 Kendus, 24th June, 1867)*. Comparing together the observations at Basle
 and Paris, Professor Hagenbach concludes that the meteor moved from over
 Dunkirk to over the neighbourhood of Cambray, in the De'partement du Nord
 at a height of between sixty-five and eighty-five miles above the earth in a
 direction from north-west towards south-east.

    The foUowing observation at St. Quentin, in Aisne, twenty-five miles south
 of Cambray, shows that the meteor continued its course still further towards
 the east, and probably passed a short distance south of St. Quentin; and of
the course assigned to it by Professor Hagenbach.

   "A very small point of crimson-red light was first seen, appearing in

the east and proceeding rapidly north-

wards, as from a to i in the figiu'e

(No. 1). It then changed its appear-

ance to a flame-colour, and suddenly

altered its direction at an obtuse angle

descending towards the west of north,

as from b to c, and gradually became extinguished, Its duration was about
two seconds. After its disap-

pearance there remained in the

sky, traced with wonderful di-

stinctness, a bright white streak

in the form of fig. 2. In the

course of ten minutes its lines

grew wider and became diffuse."'

(Eeport of Hormisdas Leblanc,

Mayor of St. Quentin, to M. W. de Fonvielle.)

    The sudden change of course, noticed by M. Leblanc, was probably attended
by a detonation ; for at Braine siu- Viste, near Soisson, in Aisne, about thirty
miles south of St Quentin, M. Ed. Lainney reports to M. de Fonvielle :

    " Walking in the fields at about eight o'clock on the evening of the 11th
of June, we heard a heavy report like that of a distant mine exploding, or of
a battery of cannon fired oft' in the distance. Twenty miles from this place, at
Fresnes, a luminous meteor was seen moving from N.W. to S.E., audit burst
with a loud explosion."

    Distant views of the meteor were obtained in the Cote d'Or and in Haute
Marne, which confirm the other accounts of the long duration of the smoke-
like train, and afi'ord some more details of the position of the meteor. The
first of these reports is by M. L. Roussy, chronometer-maker to the Toulouse
Observatory, whose acquaintance with the writings of M. Petit on the sub-
ject of luminous meteors led him to observe the phenomenon with particular

attention.

   "I was in the train which had just left the station near Dijon (Cote d'Or)
returning to Paris, and leaning against the window on the right of the train,
when at 8'' 9" (Paris time) I perceived a luminous streak of very intense
light preceded by an advancing fireball, of which the accompanying figure

disappeared, as shown in the figure, with a shower of sparks at about 31°

or 32° above the horizon.
    " Dui-ing the space of eight minutes the train of light preserved its form,

while its brilliancy at the same lime gradually decreased. It then grew more

diffuse, both lengthening and widening, and undergoing a deformation of its

shape at the ends, which folded                 Fig. 2.

to move pretty rapidly towards

the west, while the changes of

its shape continued. At nine o'clock it was still visible with its original

brightness, and having now the shape shown in fig. 3, which it preserved

until it vanished. Its colour at this time resembled that of steam from the
funnel of a locomotive engine discoloured by coal-smoke. The point a foi'med
the apex of a triangle where two linos of the streak a h, a c met together
without any portion of the streak between them. At 9'' 5'" p.m. a star (E)

a little over, and to the right of the sunset made its appearance, and by its
aid the gradual motion of the streak towards the west was easily perceived.

    " I expected that from the great height at which the streak Avas probably

placed, it would still continue to be illuminated for a much longer time, but
it gradually disappeared at the same time that the stars began to make their

appearance in the sky.

light, which at first had the appearance represented in fig. 1, which it pre-

    Ten or twelve minutes after its first appearance its form was that of fig. 3.

It was now drifting slowly from the east towards the west, and without

losing anything of its sharpness of definition and bright white appearance it
was hidden behind a cloud, fifteen or twenty minutes after the time of its
first appearance. (Report of M. Gilbin to M. de Fonvielle.)

   The accounts of numerous other observers in Paris, Eheims, and Strasbour"-,
in France, at Luxembourg, and at Geneva, Bern, Ziirich, and Lielthal, in Swit-
zerland, as well as at Lindau on the eastern shore of the Lake of Constance,
testify to the same general appearance of the meteor, the occurrence of which
near the date of the 9th of June, marked in the present year by the fall of
an aerolite (noticed in the next paragraph) in Algeria, and in 1866 by the
stonefall of Knyahinja, appears to connect it with the same aerolitic period to
which the latter meteorites belong.

382 REPORT--1867.

   The occurrence of a meteoric shower with a very precise and well-defined
radiant-point at y Orionis on the 18th of October 18G-4 and 20th of October
1865, was noticed in these Eeports (for 1865, p. 122 ; and 1866, p. 134),
and the remarkable peculiarity of meteors emanating from this radiant-point
was pointed out, that they are characterized by very ruddy colour, and by

leaving voluminous streaks.

   On the nights of the lSth-20th of October 1866, the sky was so gene-

rally overcast in England that no special observations of the recurrence of

the shower could be collected. An incidental confirmation of the periodical

recurrence of remarkably fine meteors on this date is, however, afforded in
the present catalogaie by the account of an unusually large meteor, seen at
sea between England and Ireland, on the morning of the 19th of October
1866 ; and described by Mr. J. Seymour Davies. The fireball presented
precisely those peculiar features which characterize the meteors emanating
from this special radiant-point, both by its violet coloiu", approaching to
crimson, and by leaving a persistent luminous streak, which remained
visible five minutes by the watch. The direction of the meteor, " from south
to north," also agrees with that which meteors passing nearly overhead from
this radiant-point would pursue at S^ a.m. (which was the hour of the obser-

vation), when the constellation of Orion, in which the radiant-point is j^laced,

is situated upon the southern meridian.

                       Meteor-shower of November 13th-14th, 1866.

   On the night of the 12th-13th of November the densely overcast state of

the sky in England permitted few observations to be recorded.
   At the Observatory, King's College, Aberdeen, five observers took their

station at 10" p.m., and watched until I'' 30TM a.m. on the 13th. Mr. D.

Gill reports :--

   " The sky was beautifully clear, excepting a low bank of cloud, which
extended all round the horizon. At IS*" 50TM small patches of cloud appeared
in different parts of the sky, but entirely disappeared by 1'' 30TM a.m. Streaks
of aurora appeared irregularly throughout the whole night.

    " Comparatively few meteors with trains were observed on this evening
and the following morning, most of the phenomena partaking more of the
appearance of ordinary shooting-stars. In the accompanying journal their

general position only is noted."

    The particulars of a few meteors of a marked description are entered
above, in the Catalogue. The numbers of the meteors seen in the successive
half hours by the five observers were as follows :

 inflections of the curve at the Cape of Good Hope are displaced from those
 at Leyton by about an equal interval. Mr. G. Forbes, of St. Andrews Uni-
 versitv, accounts for the difference* by showing that, in the relative position
 of the earth with respect to the zone of meteors on the morning of the 14th

   At Wimbledon. -Mr. F. C. Penrose states that " the origin or radiant-point
in Leo was clearly between -/ and e ; but I

question if a single point gives a satisfactory
origin, and I submit that a circle of about 3°

in diameter is more consistent with the direc-

tion of the paths of the meteors, as P in the

   At Hawlhurst. .Sir John Herschcl laid

down the position of the radiant-point with

great precision on Bode's chart of the constel-

lation Leo on the morning of the 14tli of 'No-

vember, and found its " longitude for 1866|

(allowing 55' for precession since 1801, the

epoch of the chart) to be 142° 20', and its lati-

tude 10° 15' North." (Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,

vol. xxvii. p. 20.)

   At Freshwater, Isle of Wight.--Mr. Pritchard, the President of the Royal

Astronomical Society, in a letter to Mr. Herschel states that on the 14th of

November he marked the radiant-point thus, {© Nov. 13, 1866}, " at x Leonis

(the least bit above it). I should say that it was too plain to admit mistake
to those who looked long enough."

   At Clifton, Somersetshire.--In a letter to ' The Times ' (of November
15th) Mr. G. F. Burder writes:-- " It was especially interesting to watch the
meteors which took their origin in the immediate neighbourhood of the centre
from which they all radiated. With the aid of these, it was easy to deter-
mine with exactness the radiant-point. This spot was in a line between y
and n Leonis, about 3° from the former, and 5.i° from the latter star."

jects continually appeared at a point situated in the centre of the quadrilateral
y, i^, 11, e Leonis, at E. A. 148°, IS". Decl. 25° ; and these appeared as blue ne-
bulous patches 3' or 4' in diameter. Meteor-streaks within a circle of 4° radius
round this point appeared more compact and brighter than those observed

elsewhere."

  A printed account of the meteoric shower by Mr. D. Smith describes the

radiant-point, or point from which the meteors emanated, as most clearly and
beautifully kept. " This point wa.s, in the present instance, about the centre

--of the ' sickle ' in the constellation Leo."
   At Beeston Observaton/, Nottingham. Mr. Lowe reports that "At 2'' l",

and again at 2** 9TM, and at 4'" 31TM a.m., meteors appeared on the exact radiant-
point in Leo, blazed out, and died away without mo\'ing. I traced sixty
meteors to ascertain the exact point, and I made it nearer e than jj Leonis,
If a line were drawn from a to fi, and another from y to e Leonis, where
those two lines cut each other I conceived the point was close to."

  --At Wishech, Cambridgeshire. Mr. S. H. Miller briefly describes the radiant-
--point thus : " The point of radiation was manifest from the first. I should
--fix the radiant-point between y and i^ of Leo."

   At Mancliestir. Mr. Greg considered that the radiant-point, " though not a
mathematical centre-point, was very closely round the star 4 Leonis, extend-

--ing from y Leonis towards e Leonis Muioris."
   At Sunderland. The position of the radiant-point was determined Avith
care by Mr. Backhouse, who states that " the meteors belonged to two classes.

Class i. These radiated from Leo. I carefully traced back the courses of
fifty-four of them, and found the radiant-point to be R. A. 9*^ 57" (148° 15'),
N. Dccl. 23° 50'. But tracing it only from those in and near Leo, between
12" 30'" and 2" 8"' .v.m., it seemed to be R. A. Vi^ 56|"' (149° 15'), N. Decl.
23° 15' ; and from those in and near Leo between 2'' 8'" a.m. and 3'' 35" a.m.;
R. A. 9" 58i'» (149° 37'), N. Decl. 22° 45'."

  --Mr. J. Crompton reports from "NVisbech, Cambridgeshire : " It seemed as

if we could mark out in the sky the path that they would take, or almost hang
wires for them to run upon, so regularly did they pass over, in lines converg-
ing backwards over a space in or about Leo. I think that we noticed only

three which took any other or opposite direction."
    The point of radiatior. during the principal part of the display on the morning

of the 14th of November 1866, was observed in France, at Metz, by M. C.
M. Goulier, who frequently projected it from comparison with the sky upon

the planisphere of Chazallon. Corrected for precession since the date of the

map (1850-0), the coordinates of the position of the radiant-point were
E. A. 1495 (9I' 58""), N. Decl. 23°. M. Goulier adds that '· the uncertainty

attaching to this position of the radiant-point is certainly less than one degree."

(Comptes Rendus, December 1866.)

                                            BricfMtiess of the Meteors.

    Mr. F. C. Penrose, at Wimbledon, Surrey, reports on the moniing of the
14th, that " at l** 20"> a.m., or thereabouts, a very bright meteor passed to-
wards the south-west and produced a very sensible reflected light. Neither

F. or H. saw the meteor, but only the reflected light. On looking up, the

train was distinctly seen, and remained visible for at least two minutes by

 estimation.

    " H. recorded one meteor, only, which was clearly brighter than Sirius;
and F. questions ha^dng seen any brighter than Sirius. That above men-

tioned (which was made known by its reflected light alone) may have ap-
proached the maximum brilliancy of Venus."

   The jmiteor which appeared over Scotland at 2'» 41'" a.m., as seen by obser-
vers watching the meteors from the top of Carlton Hill, threw their shadows
on the ground. It was the reflected light, also, which first drew Mr. GiU's

attention to it at Aberdeen.

  A writer in the ' Newcastle Chronicle ' states that " sometimes, when two

or three large meteors would fall straight down in a parallel course leaving
long streams of light behind them, a greenish glare was cast around."

   The scale of brightness of eighty-three considerable meteors, whose appa-
rent paths were recorded at the Glasgow Observatory by Mr. Alex. S.
Herschel, assisted by Mr. A. Macgregor for the pui-pose of determining the

radiant-point, was as follows :

As bright as Jupiter, or brighter . .  =2 meteors  3 per cent.

          ,, Sirius                    14 ,, =17 ,,
         ,, Ist-mag. star
         ,, 2nd-mag. star              39 ,, =48 ,,

                                       2G ,, =32 ,,

   The report of Mr. Backhouse at Sunderland contains a similar estimate of

their brightness.

   " About l** SO"" A.M. I tried to ascertain the proportion of meteors of dif-
ferent magnitudes, with the result below :

gradually a bright reddish yellow, and the trains, even after the nuclei

became yellow, were generally green."

- The writer in the ' Newcastle Chronicle', already mentioned, states that
the meteors " moved across the sky, leaving in their track, lines sometimes

of greenish light, and sometimes of a dull red colour."
   Mr. Howie tt, at Flimwell (Kent), states that " the nuclei were mostly

bluish white, except when near the horizon they appeared of an orange or

ruddy tint. The trains Avere generally of a greenish-white hue, except for
the last two degrees or so, which at the moment of explosion assumed a

ruddy appearance."

   Mr. Lowe reports, at Eeeston, near Nottingham, that " the great number

of large meteors, on the S.E. horizon up to 15° altitude, were mostly

--orange-red, whilst those between Leo and the north were bluish white."
   Mr. J. Crompton states, at Norwich : " The colours of the nuclei were
mostly white, blue, metaUic-green, and sometimes a coppery red. One

which I saw cross the foot of Ursa Major was marked as changing its

colour from whitish blue to red."

  An observer at Hawkhurst (Kent), reports that " the brighest colours,

whether of head or streak, appeared in those which were nearest to the

radiant-point. One brilliant one at that place, seen by four or five of us,

turned pure mauve [lilac] colour before it exploded."
   At Saragossa, in Spain, " The meteors all left a well-defined tail or track

of sparks of a pale bluish colour, and they finally exploded with a brilliant

white or yellow flame ; in some instances the flame appeared tinged on the

edges with a vivid emerald-green colom-, and others exhibited tints of pink

--or crimson and blue." (The Times, Nov. 19.)
-- WeMr. T. Crumplen states, in his report of observations made on Primrose
Hill with Mr. S. Wix : "   saw a number of meteors diflcring in colour,

some of a gold or copper tint, some quite ruddy ; htit the very great majority

were brilliant white or blue, resembling the electric light.

" The prevailing tinge of the trains was decidedly green." In his letter

to the ' Evening Standard (Nov. 15th), Mr. Crumplen also remarks, that
" the general colour of the nuclei was of a pale blue, while a brilliant pea-

green marked the trains."

   Amongst other observations at Cambridge, Professor Challis records, that
" a circumstance, which I had not noticed at the August period, was a blue

or green appearance of several of the trains, with heads of a ruddy colour.

--Some few of the heads also were thought to be blue." (Monthly Notices,

E.A.S., vol. xxvii. p. 77.)

    Mr. Greg, at Manchester, considers that " the prevalent colour of the

meteors was a diiU white   I saw one fine green one, with a defined

disk, near the radiant-point, about 12'' 80TM, which began with a brilliant
nucleus, and another crimson and green ; and I fancy that I occasionally

perceived a very slight bluish tinge in the trains."
   Mr. H. S. Heinecken, observing at Sidmouth, states that " almost invari-

ably the coloiu' of the head was ruddy. The trains of by far the greater

proportion were greenish blue ; some of them more intense greenish blue,
and more compact and less powdery than others. The green was not unlike

the combustion of silver by the galvanic current."
   At the Cape of Good Hope Observatory the shower was noticed by Sir

Thomas Maclear as consisting of " orange-coloured meteors, leaving streaks

of green, mingled with ordinary-looking shooting-stars." (Edinb. Quar-

terly Review for January 1867.) Mr. G. W. H. Maclear considered " the
                                                      --;;

prevailing colour [of the nuclei] to be orange, with a long sea-green train.
Others were of a deep red, like balls of fire, without any train at all."

   Mr. D. Gill, at Aberdeen, fiirther noticed that the trains, " which at first
were of a bluish or yellow colour, changed into a beautiful emerald-green."

   At Clifton, Mr. G. F. Eurder particularizes the colour of the trains as
being " of a most delicate greenish hue. This greenish tint was very con-
stant. The meteors themselves, on the contrary, had often a ruddy glow
and in cases when the path was very much foreshortened to the eye, and both
trains and meteor coidd therefore be seen in opposition, the contrast between
the colours of the two was very remarkable." (The Times, Nov. 15.)

   At Chesham, Bucks, according to the report of Mr. C. Grover, " Most of

the meteors exhibited a decidedly red head, with a bluish-green train. I
noted that their altitude had a great influence on their colour, those on the

mhorizon being much more tinted than those the zenith, where some of the

brightest looked nearly white, -with, blue trains. Their position, with regard
to the radiant-point, also greatly influenced their colour. Those whose paths
were considerably foreshortened, in and about Leo, showing brilliant colours,
the red head and greenish train being strongly contrasted, while those with
long trains in the west were comparatively pale in colours."

                                                Spectroscopic Ohservafio)is.

   At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, Mr. Carpenter of the Astronomical
Department of the Observatory, and Mr. Nash of the Meteorological Depart-
ment, had spectroscopes, but neither detected any luminous or dark lines in
the spectra of any of the meteors, or of their trains ; not even the sodium
line found by Mr. Herschel in some of the Augiist meteors.

   The rapid cessation of the shower, and the desirability of filling up a chart

of meteor-tracks for determining the radiant-point during the brief time that

it lasted in what was at first considered to be the earliest part of its display,

was the reason why no extensive observations -with the meteor- spectroscope
were made at Glasgow by Mr. Herschel and Mr. A. Macgregor. The fol-

lowing observations were recorded (Intellectual Observer, vol. x. p. 461) :
    " At 12'' 41" a dazzling object, two or three times as bright as Venus,

passed in a second from midway between the ' pointers ' to the nose of the
Lesser Bear, leaving a bright streak, divided, like the last, into two parts
but the first part in this case remained visible the longest. The end-half
afforded a decided spectrum, appearing as a single bright band in the

spectroscope no broader than if looked at through an ordinary piece of

glass

   " The number of streaks now visible in the sky gave another opportunity

for using the spectroscope.

" The result shows that some of the streaks were composed of monochro-

matic light, altogether uudimmed by its passage through the prisms."

   Mr. Browning obsei-ved the spectra of several meteors in the meteor-
Spectroscope, from the observatory of Mr. Barnes at Upper HoUoway, Lon-
don, between 9^ 30TM p.m., and 4'' a.m. on the morning of the 14th of No-

vember 1S66.

   The spectra which he obtained were of four kinds :
    " 1. Continuous spectra of the nuclei, in which the whole of the colours
of the solar spectrum were visible, except violet. In even the most uniform

of these, I am inclined to think that the yellow was strongly predominant*.

<' 2. Those which gave a bright orange-yellow line of light, or only a faint

continuous spectrum in addition to this yellow line f.
    " 3. Spectra consisting, apparently, of only a single line of green light,

of nearly the same colour as that shown by thallium,
   " Of this kind I only obtained the spectra of two meteors. In one of these

I thought that I detected, in addition, a very faint continuous spectrum,

nearly obscured bj' the brilliancy of the green line.

   " 4. The spectra of the trains.
   " The light from green trains appeared continuous in the prisms.
    " Those which were of a blue colour appeared as a [(?)faint] line of laven-

der colour, with a stUl fainter trace of a continuous spectrum. In some

few instances [/. e.(?) of the lavender line] no continuous spectrum could

be detected."

Mr. Greg obtained the following observations with the meteor-spectroscope

at Manchester.

   " The spectra of the nuclei of the three large ones which I observed, much

resembled in size and gorgeous effect that of the crescent moon, which I
looked at in the meteor-spectroscope on the following evening. As I did not

see the meteors with direct vision, I cannot say how large they appeared

naturally.

   " Their spectra all consisted of crimson, green, and blue. The spectra of
two of them were a little less well marked at the outer edges, and between

the colours, than the spectrum of the third, in which the demarcation between

the red, green, and blue, as well as the definition at the outer edges of the
spectrum, was perfect. In one of them there seemed to be pretty niimerous

darker lines across the spectrum in a vertical du'ection ; and at the instant of
disappearance I saw, or thought that I saw, an orange line, or band between

   * Wlien a star of small magnitude is looked at through the meteor-spectroscope, its
light is either completely washed out, and invisible, or a line of faint and apparently
colourless light marks its pLice. The length of this line of light, up to the cases of tliose
stars in which it can no longer be discerned, continues to be about half a degree. There
exists no tendency in the yellow rays of the stellar spectra to remain outstanding, when

--fixed stars of very feeble light are examined in the meteor-spectroscope. A. S. H.

that there was any colour."

                                          Characteristic Appearances.

   At Greenwich, on one or two occasions during the display, meteors were

observed to have a double out-burst, the principal meteors passing on at the
head of the stream of light, the secondary nucleus remaining in the luminous
track. The accompanying is a sketch of one of these remarkable objects,
supplied by Mr. Dunkin, of the Royal Observatory, in a drawing illustrating
the general appearance of the shower. (Leisure Hour, Jan. 5th, 1SG7.)

   A triple meteor, each part being as bright as Yenus, is described by Mr.

 G. Forbes as having been seen by him at St. Andrews (Philosophical Maga-
 zine, S. 4. vol. xxsiii. p. 83) at 12'' 41" a.m., which left a streak visible
for eight minutes. At Glasgow attention was drawn to the meteor by the
 bright light in the first half of its course. At this part a streak remained
visible for nine minutes, and collected itself into an oval form, while the

portion of the streak in the last half of the meteor's course, in which a good
view of the meteor was obtained at Glasgow, remained straight, and faded
away in about 30 seconds. The appearance of the meteor in the latter por-
tion of its path, at Glasgow, was that of a single pear-shaped nucleus about
as bright as Yenus, drawing a bright train of light, like that left by other
bright meteors of the shower.

   A remarkable double meteor, equally cui-ious, was observed by M. J. J.

Silbermann of the College de France, at Paris, during the progress of the
shower. This meteor passed slowly from Leo to the square of Ursa Major,
and onwards towards the west horizon, leaving no train. It consisted of two
brilliant round white nuclei, each about as bright as Jupiter, and 15' apart,
which oscillated to and fro, and before and behind each other, exactly as if

--performing perfect revolutions in a cii'cle round each other, in a plane per-

pendicular to the visual line, one revolution in ever)^ second of time. The
whole diu'ation was 8 or 10 seconds, and both meteors disajopeared too-ether

    At Hawliliurst. " At 12'* 6TM a.m., two pear-shaped meteors, both brighter

than Yenus, changing from yellow into orange, pursued one another in
almost identically the same course, at an apparent distance of about thi-ee
moon's diameters between them, both expanding together, and both leavino-

trains.

    " Another red meteor, about the same time, which grew to be as bright
and round as Sii'ius, was distinctly observed by all to make two darts or shots

in its flight.

       General Ajppearances of the Shower,

Mr. Wood thus describes the general characteristics of the meteors :

" Unlike those of any other display, they never burst or threw off sparks,

but either burnt gradually away, or wasted away in forming the streak.

This meteoric shower is further distinguished by striking uniformity in

colour, size, and greater duration, both of the meteor and of the streak, than

in other showers. The colour may be said to be pale green, the proportion

between this and the red being about 4 to 1. The average size was nearly

Athat of Mars, then shining, which many of the meteors resembled.     small

proportion only were equal to Jupiter ; and I saw only one that somewhat

exceeded Yenus at its greatest brilliancy. Another peculiar featui'e of the

meteors was great accui-acy of radiation.        Fig. 4.

   " At 2'' 16'", a green meteor, brighter than Venus, moved from the

radiant-point to R. A. 135° (9"), N. Decl. 20°, leaving a broad green streak
4' or 5' in width upon its course (fig. 7, a). This meteor was the brightest,
and its streak was the broadest and the most enduring seen. The latter
rem.ained as a bright green rippled and waved bar of light for six seconds
before either fading, curling up, or dissolving away. It then gradually, in
the space of about two minutes, assumed the form of fig. 7, h.

    " Between one and two minutes after its first appearance, I perceived the
spot c (fig. 7), resembling in size and appearance the Pnesepe Cancri, a very
little in advance of the spot where the meteor disappeared. "WTiether it
was formed there by drifting from h, or if it was independently formed by
the meteor, I cannot say, but I incline to the latter opinion."

   The streaks, when fii'st deposited, were remarkably straight, and fine,
bright, lance-like lines. They then, as described by Mr. T. Morris at Man-

-- --chester, " in many instances appeared to swell in the centre of their length
    the point of greatest ignition probably and taper towards the extremity,
forming an approach to a double cone."

   In a letter to a Member of the Committee, describing some of the pheno-

--mena of the shower as it appeared at Hawkhurst, Sir John Herschel re-

marks : " In a r/rm^ mnnn instances (indeed most commonly) the head

SHOT AHE.vn of the train, as a star or planet of a very high red colour. All the

trains were sparkling like star-dust, but in two or three cases there was a
remainder of cometic phosphorescent light, very persistent. In one which
exploded with a flash close to a, ft, y Arietis [see Catalogue, l*" 12'" 30*
A.M.], this cometic appearance lasted by the watch six minutes."

    In illustration of this peculiarity the foUonying was observed at Hawk-

liiirst. " About 11'' 30", a dull yeUow meteor, which, grew to a round disk,
moved on a curved course (see fig.), nearly horizontally from Ursa Minor

to a point due west, leaving a slight train. The nucleus lasted three seconds,

--and continued after the train had faded aivai/."
   Mr. Greg observed, at Manchester : " IS'early aU the meteors showed either

as simply phosphorescent or lance-like lines, or began as such. But in the

case of the larger ones, with disks of 2' or upwards, the nuclei seemed

finally to emerge from, or to shake off, or lose the phosphorescence, for the

space of a few degrees and then vanish."

   Mr. C. Grover, in his observations of the ISTovember meteoric shower at
Chesham, Bucks, reports that, " in nearly every instance, the head ceased to

emit a train before it vanished, consequent!)/ the head tvas clearly jparted from

the train just before vanishing."

The same was noticed by M. Goulier in the ' Comptes Eendus ' for De-

cember 1866, whoso observation of the position of the radiant-point at

"AMetz (in the Moselle) is cited above.   remarkable peculiarity of the

meteors was, that the streaks were shorter than the entire length of their

course, the nucleus shooting ahead of the train for some sjiace without emit-

ting the phosphorescent light of the streak."

  --Contortions of the Trains. The large meteor recorded by Mr. H. S. Heinec-

ken at Sidmouth, at l** 8"" 9' (see Catalogue), left a train which was very

conspiciious for six minutes, and remained visible for at least ten minutes.

   At first the train was straight, but when the terminations faded, the

central portion became cur^-ed, and folded back in a serpent-like form upon
itself. The figure is a sketch of its appearance, from a tinted drawing by

Mr. Hutchinson. It afterwards became brilliantly nebulous, more circular
and compact, and retrograded slowly along the course of the meteor towards

the east.

   In the -Monthly Notices' of the EoyalAstronomicalSociety(vol.xsvii.p.53),
Mr. G. Yenables draws attention to the fact that, in some instances of trains
which continued for a length of time, the deflection which occurred was
" not curved but rigid, like a stiff stick broken in the middle."

--406 REPORT 1867.

to use the telescope with a power of 45. The trains then looked much like
some Nebulfe, and I saw these forms (see figures)."

 --At Bathwick Hill, Bath, Mr. W. Dobson reports : " I observed the trains

of several with an achromatic telescope (Cooke's 4-inch aperture, power 40).
They mostly disappeared rapidly, except one large one, about 1" 50'" a.m.,

low in the west, the train of which remained visible in the telescope for nine

minutes. It appeared like a long wisp of luminous vapour or smoke, bend-

ing and changing its form, growing broader and fainter, and drifting slowly

down the wind. While observing it another smaller one crossed the field of

the telescope, but its train disappeared in a few seconds."

   Mr. T. Crumplen made many telescopic observations, leading in some cases

to good results, both of the nuclei and of the trains of the meteors, from

Primrose Hill.
   " The instrument used was byDollond, of l|-inch clear aperture, about 22

inches focal length, and power of 30. I took care to focus it on a fi:s;ed star,

so that no doubt could arise as to the value of the observations made, and

mythese, so far as practicable, were confirmed by  assistant, who is also

accustomed to use the telescope for celestial objects.

   " I saw many meteor-trains by this means, but in most cases they faded

too rapidly for good observations. Eight, however, were examined with

great success.

   " One of these, at l"" 7"", was visible 10 full minutes. TVTien first seen,

immediately after the meteor disappeared, it looked like a long piece of

riband in constant motion, and waved throughout its entire length. This

band was then nearly 5' in width, and appeared streaky or mottled, as if
made up of an immense niimher of interlaced filaments.

    " It changed shape during the time that I observed it, gradually becoming

more nebulous, and at last it was almost a circular patch, somewhat elon-

gated towards the west. "When in this state it passed over a tolerably

bright telescopic star. I could see the star approaching, and I noticed a

decided difference in the brilliancy and appearance of this star when im-

mersed in the meteor-train. It was vmdoubtedly refracted*. This meteor
disappeared some 5° below a Tauri, and the train drifted as much more

towards the west-north-west horizon before it finally disappeared.
    " Besides this train, I had telescopic views of seven others, which under-

went similar contortions. In several cases the trains bent upwards, becom-

ing shaped like the crescent moonf, the horns always directed to the zenith.

The filaments in the telescope almost always reminded me of the particles of

fibre which fly from the sudden lash of a whip.
    " It was extremely difficult to get a view of a nucleus. In two instances

I caught them passing the field, but in flight too transient to permit me to

speak of their appearance in positive terms. They resembled a solid body
imbedded in a nebulous haze ; biit althovigh I have their appearance well in

my mind, I forbear to say anything open to question."

   * As the effect of refraction would make the star Lang upon the edge of the cloud, as       I
is cometimes believed to be the case from a similar cause in the occultation of stars by
the moon, such an eifect may have been, hitherto, overlooked That the star's aiapearanoe
was affected by partial absorption, or oljscuratiou of its light, is an alteration more easy,
in general, to bo explained by a haze, or misty vapour suspended in the cloud.

   t This appearance was sometimes observed with the naked eye. An observer at
Mentonc, Mr. Moggridge, in a letter to a Member of the Committee, states that they

heralded great outbreaks of the meteoric shower immediately following theii- appearance,
and tenns them " lunettes."

   At Wimhledon, Mr. F. C. Penrose         --reports : At'·' about 2''  30"'  a.m.
we took our stand at the telescope,
without, however, making any particu-
lar observations until 3"' 6"" a.m., when
a bright short streak was observed, in
R. A. 13'^ 12°\ N. Decl. 37°. It was of
bluish-silvery colour, and resembled a
riband, as shown in the figure; but
there were probably many more ' kinks

in it than here shown. It remained
visible in the telescope several minutes,
and finally before vanishing, separated

into two parts."

   In illustration of the many " kinks"

observed with the telescope in the

streak of this meteor, Mr. Penrose gives
the annexed representation of the ten-

dril of a climbing plant, twined towards the right, or towards the left, round
a slender stem. Eddies and currents of air along the course of the meteor's
flight, of the nature of smoke-rings,

propagated obliquely towards the right
or left, might very possibly conduce to
the twisted and knotted appearance of

the streak, most commonly observed
with the telescope.

   " About tills time H. observed a small
meteor in the telescope passing over the
field of view, between 6 and t (the
sword stars) of Orion ; and F. soon
after saw one pass the field of view near
the Prtesepe of Cancer. Neither of them
showed any remarkable feature, and
they left no train. F. saw that which
passed the Sword of Orion with the
naked eye. It was one of the average

smaller meteors. It appeared in the

telescope exactly like a star of the sixth magnitude.

   " At 3'' 25"" 50', we saw in the telescope, at a point about E. A. lo** 20"',

N. Decl. 5.5°, the streak of a meteor, narrower and brighter than that before
described, but otherwise similar in structure to it, full of kinks and bends,
but this being of greater length than the former, there were more of them."

   General accounts of observations of the shower were also received from Mr.

W. T. Bedford, Sidmouth ; Mr. H. Player, Totnes, Devonshire ; Mr. E. H. Rodd,

--Penzance ; Mr. Clarke Richardson, Swansea ; and Mr. G. Iliff, at Sunderland.
    Geograj^liical Limits of the Shoiver. The brightest portion of the meteoric
shower, on the night of the 13th-14th of November 1866, was visible as far
eastward as Kishnaghur (lat. 23° 24-' N., long. 83° 37' E.), about sixty miles
due north of Calcutta, and as far westwards as a point in the Atlantic

Ocean, near the Azores, in lat. 39° 56' N., long. 32° 20' "W., or over a zone
of at least 115° 57' of longitude.

   It was observed at Aberdeen, in Scotland (lat. 57° 9' 51" N.), and at the

   The boundaries of this area nearly coincide with that of the star-shovrcr
seen on the 13th of November 1832, which was succeeded in the following
year by the well-known great November shower in America, observed by
Twining and Olmsted, on the morning of the 13th of November 1833, by a
recurrence of which in the present year (1867), the shower now described

would thus be followed by a fitting sequel.

   At Kislmaglmr, Lower Bengal, India.--Extract of a letter from Mr. W.
Masters to Sir J. F. W. Herschel, Bart.--" Since the morning of the 14th

of November, diverging meteors were not seen or detected on any of the
periodic dates, except the 12th of December. I observed them at 2'' 30TM

A.M. of this date. They might have come on at an earlier hour, and they

appeared to have passed off by 3'' a.m. They shot divergingly, and with
great rapidity, from a point about 29° or 30° of North Declination, and 136°

of Eight Ascension. They darted ovA at the rate of about three per minute,
were small, described short and thin arcs of light, and left no traces. Some
showed themselves only as moderate flashes of light, about 40° or 50° from

this point, without any visible arc of light or course.

At Birminqham, Mr. Wood kept a strict watch for meteors on the nights

of the 12th arid 13th of December. «· On the night of the 11th, the sky at

Birmingham was overcast all night. Towards 11'' p.m., on the night of the

12th, meteors were very frequent, about one per minute in one half of

the sky, the other half of the sky being overcast. The sky then became
completely overcast, and remained so until shortly after midnight, when it

became partly clear, and the frequency of the meteors was found to have

greatly decreased. From 12'' 53"" a.m. until 1'' 15°' a.m., with two-thirds
to a quarter of the sky quite clear, none were seen. The maximum of the

shower probably occurred between eleven and twelve o'clock, beginning at

10" 30'" P.M. on the 12th, and ending at 1" a.m. on the 13th. The radiant-

point was between H and a Geminorum. The meteors were blue and white,

of momentary duration, and the majority of them without trains. On the

night of the 13th the sky was clear, but no meteors were seen in twenty

Aminutes from 9'' 30'" p.m. to 9" 50"' p.m.  display of aurora borealis appeared

in the N.N.W., with streamers rddiating from a point below the horizon,

mo\'ing from west to east, and 120° or more in length."

At Milhroolc, Tuam, in Ireland, the sky began to clear on the night of

the 12th, at 9 o'clock. From that time until 1'' 25'" a.m. on the 13th, Mr.

Birmingham counted 260 meteors, of which number 20 only were uncon-

formable. Mthough nine meteors, between 9'' 15'" p.m. and 9'' 30'" p.m.,

were shown by alignments to radiate from within a circle about 3° in dia-

meter, with its centre in E. A. 107°, N. Decl. 19°, yet a meteor, nearly

stationary at the intersection of lines joining (j and e, o and Q Geminorum,

appeared to indicate a somewhat higher radiant. In comparison with the

November shower, the aspect of the meteors might be described as dndery,

with, however, a few notable exceptions. They were mostly of a bluish- white

colour, many traiidess, but in general leaving a faint train of the same colour

as the nucleus. One meteor, that was brighter than Sirius, showed a serpen-

tine coxTrse. There was no well-marked time of maximum, but there seemed

to be alternate periods of repose and activity. At 3'' 8" an immense fire-

   Heavy snow, and the overcast state of the sky in England on the night of
the 1st and morning of the 2nd of January 1867, prevented observations of
luminous meteors. On the evening of the 2nd of January, about 9^ 30TM p.m.,
when the sky was comparatively clear, Mr. Crumplen watched for meteors for
a few minutes, in Loudon, and saw none.

   On the nights of the 19th and 20th of April 1867, the sky was overcast,
with constant rain, at Glasgow. No reports of the reappearance of the April

meteoric shower, in 1867 have been received from other places.

                             (7.) The August meteors, in 1867.

   Ki Birmingliam, Mr. "Wood reports a verj^ fine sky on the nights of the 9th,
11th, and 12th. On the night of the 10th the sky was clear over head until
1*^ 30TM A.M. on the morning of the 11th.

   From 9'' p.m. to 11'' 32TM p.m. on the 9th, only two meteors were observed
in one hour and a half. Their number then increased, and the paths of 18
meteors were recorded in two hours. There was an equal scarcity of meteors

on the night of the 10th ; when, in one hour, from 9*' p.m. to 10"^ p.m. no
meteors were observed. The interval of half an hour, from 12'' 16TM to 12'' 45'"
a.m. on the morning of the 11th, also presented a total absence of meteors.
Five meteors were then observed in 15 minutes, and the sky afterwards be-

came overcast. On the nights of the 11th and 12th the rate of apparition was
respectively 3 and 2 meteors per hour. On the morning of the 11th it was

as high as 7, and on the morning of the 10th as high as 14 per hour.

   New York Herald, August 12th.--" Poughkeepsie, August, 11th, 1867:--

Shortly after one o'clock tins morning an entirely clear sky was visible ....
From one tiU two a.m. over seventy meteors were counted, and from that
time tni half-past three a.m. they increased in number so fast that they could
not be counted. Three of them were of great brilliancy. By four o'clock
A.M. the unusual exhibition had entirely ceased."

   The rarest displays of sliower-meteors are comparatively brief in their
duration, and Mr. Marsh points out " that observations extending over several
days, and variously situated in longitude, are needed, in order to show
the earth's progress through the group, and to determine the exact time of

central passage."

    V. Papers relating to Observations of Luminous Meteors.

   1. Professor Newton, on " The Pielative JN'umber of Shooting-stars seen in
a given Period by diiferent numbers of Observers." (American Journal of
Science, 2nd ser. vol. xli. p. 192.)

   The results of this careful series of observations made at ISTowhaven, Con-
necticut, on the morning of the 15th of November 18G5, may be referred to
as a common standard for determining the rate of ai)parition of meteors in
cases where several observers combine together to register their numbers.

   During the three hours, from midnight imtil three o'clock a.m., on the
morning of the 15 th of November, twelve observers at Newhaven were so
arranged that two looked to the zenith, and the remaining ten divided the
points of the compass equally between them. As each observer saw a meteor

he called his name, which was entered by an initial letter in tho register. By

three o'clock 186 meteors were counted.
   The average number seen by each person was 38'75. Hence the propor-

tion

    No. seen by one observer : No. seen by twelve : : 38*75 : 186                                  (1)

The average number seen by two persons looking towards opposite points

of the compass  (taking  all  the  pairs  of such  observers)  was  75-4                           and hence
                                                                                                :

    No. seen by two observers : No. seen by twelve : : 75-4 : 186                                  (2)

   The average number seen by three observers looking nearly symmetrically

to different points of the compass (taking all the combinations of such obser-

vers) was 99-7. Whence

No. seen by three observers : No. seen by twelve : : 99-7 : 186                                    (3)

    Proceeding thus with all the symmetrical combinations of four, five, six, or
more observers, and comparing the results with the similar results obtained
by a party of six observers on the night of the 15th of August 1865, the
numbers seen by more or less numerous observers are shown in the following
Table, which also contains the relative numbers seen by different parties of
observers, in the time that four observers would take to count 100.

   " As far as I have heen able to examine the question, the arc subtended by

the difference of the angles a', a" may be more or less exactly measured by

comparing together the lengths of the major and minor axes of the radiant

region in those cases where it appears to have an elongated form. Projected

and measured upon a map of the stars, this arc occasionally amounts to 10°,

or 15°, independently of o° allowed for errors of observation, and for other

sources of inaccuracy."

   By the " arc subtended by the difference of the angles a', «"," the difference
from parallelism between the lines r' m, r" m" in the above paper is per-
haps intended to be signified; and this may amount occasionally to 15°,

It is plain, however, that the real difficulty connected with the long endu-

rance of particiilar radiant-points in a nearly fixed position is, to explain

why the elongation of the radiant region, or the difference from parallelism

actually observed, does not, in general, amount to a quantity nearly as large

as the difference between the angles «', a"

V V, parallel to rr S ; and this is also the
direction of the relative velocity, with

respect to tlie earth, of the meteors vriiich overtake the earth at B. The
radiant-point of the meteors at a, B would, in such a case, therefore have a
nearly invariable direction, or apparent position in the skj', E, E, ; and in

ON DREDGING AMONG THE SHETLAND ISLES.  431

           Fourth Report on Dredging among the Shetland Isles.

                        By J. GwYN Jeffreys^ F.R.S.

Ik spite of the weather, whicli was worse than usual in this stormy region,
some additional results of no slight interest were obtained. The three requi-
sites of such enterprises (time, money, and experience) were not wanting ; and
the valuable cooperation of Mr. Norman, Mr. Waller, and Mr. Dodd, aided by
a good yacht and crew, and by a large stock of apparatus, left nothing to desire
except calmer seas. Dr. Edmondston and his family again did aU in their
power to promote our endeavours ; and Mr. Cheyne, of Edinburgh, kindly
placed his house at Tanwiek at our disposal.

   Discoveries in natui'al histoiy are of several kinds, aU of which are nearly

--equally important : 1. New species or forms. 2. Geographical distribution.

3. Habits of animals, including in the present case those supposed to be depen-
dent on the depth of water. 4. Geological relations. 5. Extraneous inci-

dents.

   AU these I will now notice as regards the MoUusca. Other branches of the

marine Invertebrata wUl be treated of by Mr. Norman, Mr. Waller, and Dr.
M'Intosh ; and Dr. Giinther has kindly promised to report on a few small

--fishes caught in the dredge.
   1. Neiv Species. The species I am about to enumerate are new to the

British fauna, but not to science.

                                  TerebrateTla Spitzhergensis, Davidson.

  A fresh and perfect, although dead specimen occui'red in 80-90 fathoms off

Unst. The only locality hitherto recorded for this shell in a living state
is Spitzbergen. It was found by Hisinger and myself in a fossil state at
Uddevalla, and last year by Messrs. Crosskey and Eobertson in another raised
sea-bed near Christiania. There is, of course, a possibUity that the Shetland

specimen also may be fossil ; but it has all the appearance of being recent

and Terehratula cranium and T. caput-serpentis (both of which are likewise
arctic species) hve in the same place where this specimen of Terebratella
Sjntzbergensis was dredged.

                                      MhgncJionella psittacea, Gmelin.

  A specimen (unfortunately broken in dredging) was found with Terebratella

Spitzbergensis, Terebratida cranium, and T. caput-serpentis. This was filled
with soft mud, in which was a fresh, but dead young specimen of R. psittacea.
I had on a former occasion dredged a full-grown specimen and a young one
(both quite perfect, although not living) off IJnst. In ' British Conchology,'
vol. ii. pp. 22 and 23, is an account of all the specimens said to have been

taken by Capt. Laskey and others in the British seas ; and I am stiU convinced

that most of these reported discoveries were mistakes, and that some of the
specimens are fossil. The present case is free from doubt, except on the latter

ground. Single valves of Pecten Islamlicus, Tellina calcaria, and Mga trun-

cata, var. Uddevallensis, are not uncommon on the northern and eastern coasts

of Shetland, and were procured with T. Spitzbergensis and It. psittacea ; but
the former had an uumistakeably fossilized or chalky aspect, and never were
perfect or had the valves imited. It seems to be an established rule that in
 all species of marine invertebrate animals, which are distributed through the
 European seas, northern specimens excel in size those from the south ; and
 thus the comparative size of living and dead specimens of arctic species found

 in the Shetland seas may serve as an additional test to distinguish which of
432 REPORT-- 1867.

the latter are recent or surviving and which fossU or relics of the glacial epoch.
The two Brachiopods ra question must, I think, stand or fall together as
British. Mr. Davidson (the great authority on this abnormal class of the
MoUusca) says that, under the circumstances I have mentioned, " there

--appears to be a probability that these two species may occur somewhere

in the neighboiu'hood if not quaternary ; but if this last, I hardly think

they would have been so perfect and fresh as you describe them to be."

Professor Loven, who has examined my specimens, considers them recent.

According to Professor Sars, R. 2^sittacea inhabits the coast of Pinmark, as far
south as Tromso (69° 40' N. lat.), at depths of from 20 to 80 fathoms. Mr.

M'Andrew dredged it off Drontheim and in Upper Norway, at depths of from
40 to 150 fathoms. Drontheim lies in 63° N. lat., Unst in about 61°.

                                                Lecla pernula, MiiUer.

  A valve, apparently fossil, was dredged on the northern coast ; and several

valves in a fresh state (partly covered with a glossy epidermis) and a small

mperfect but dead specimen were dredged St. Magnus Bay, on the west coast,

at a depth of from 60 to 80 fathoms. As no glacial fossils of arctic species
occurred on the west coast, I have no hesitation in regarding L. pernula as
British. I had in former expeditions dredged small valves and a complete pair
east of Shetland and in the Hebrides. This species inhabits the Scandinavian
coasts, as far south as Kullen in Sweden, from 20 to 150 fathoms; and
M'Andrew records a depth of 160 fathoms : it is a circumpolar species, and
also one of our post-tertiary or quaternary fossils.

   The next two si^ecies are especially interesting, in respect both of novelty
and of the classification of the MoUusca. They belong to the class Solenoconchia
(Solenoconches, Lacaze-Duthiers, or Scaphopoda, Bronn), which is represented
by the genus Dentalium. I have elsewhere so fully treated of this peculiar class
that I will now offer merely a few remarks on the genus Siplionodentalium of
Sars, to which or an allied genus the species now about to be noticed must be re-

ferred. Sipho^wdentalhim (perhaps the tji^e of a separate family of Solenocon-
chia) is distinguished from Dentalium by having an extensile worm-like foot,
the disk of which expands in the shape of a flower and is furnished with a spike,

--by the mouth or anterior orifice of the shell being obliquely truncated in Den-
--talium it is circular, and by the posterior or smaller orifice having its mar-

gin serrated or slit on each side, instead of this orifice being furnished with

a short pipe or having its margin slit on one side only. I am inclined to refer
one of the species now discovered as British to the genus SipJwnodentalium,

and the other to the genus Cadidus of Professor Philippi*. In the latter

--genus (which Philippi proposed for the reception of a small Sicilian fossil his

Denialiimi ovidum) the shell is not cylindro-couical as in Siphonodentalium,
but is tumid in the middle or anterior portion, sometimes awl-shaped ; and

the mouth is encircled by a narrow rim. In Cadidus the shell is qiiite
smooth, transparent, and lustrous ; in Siphonodentalixmi it is striated or exhi-
bits the lines of growth, and is semitrausparcnt. The long-lost Dentalium
f/adus of Montagu, an allied species (D. davatum of Gould) from the China
Sea, another species which 1 observed in the late Mr. Cuming's collection, from
Mindanao (erroneously named Z>. acuminatum, Deshayes), and D. coarctatum of
Lamarck (a tertiary fossil) apparently belong to Cadulus, and certainly not to

Ditrupa (properly Ditrypa), a genus of testaceous Annelids the shell of
which is different in structiu'e and composition from that of Cadulus or of

                                                            ^' Moll. Sic. ii. p. 209.
          ON DREDGING AMONG THE SHETLAND ISLES.                           433

Siphonodentalium, the mouth is coutracted or pinched-in, and the auimal
is annulose and has a circular opercnlnm. On the other hand, several kinds

of shelly cases described as Dentalia really belong to Ditri/jia. If Cadulus
is not generically distinct from SijiliotiodentaVnun, the former of these names

has priority ; and we shall thus be able to expunge a more than sesquipe-
dalian name fi'om the terminology of the MoUusca. The diagram now exhi-

bited is an enlarged representation of the figures of S. Lofotense and S. siib-
fiisiformis,fvovi an admirable paper by Professor Sars, published in the Transac-
tions of the Academy of Sciences at Christiauia for 1S64 ; and it wiU serve to
explain the nature of these extraordinary mollusks. One of our species is

          ^ijplionodentalkmi Lofotense, Sars

(" Malacozoologische Jagttagelser," in Vid.-Selsk. Porh. 1864, p. 17, figs.

29-33), ranging from the Loffoden Isles to Christianiafiord, at depths of be-

tween 30 and 120 fathoms. It was rather plentiful among sandy mud in St.

Magnus Bay, at the depth of from 60 to 80 fathoms ; and I had found it in

1846 when dredging off Skye, in 1864 off' Unst, and last year in the Minch.

-- --The shell may easily be passed over as it was by me for the young of Denta-

liam entalig ; but it is more curved and cylindrical, the mouth and correspon-

ding lines of growth slope backwards, and the margin of the posterior orifice

is regularly jagged (having two slight notches on each side), and this extremity

does not form a bulbous point in the frj^ One of the characters given by Sars

My("margine aperturse posterioi'is integro ") should be amended.  observa-

tion of the animal agreed with his, except that the foot is vermiform and has a

fine point, the disk being expanded and assuming the shape of a flower only

when the Siphonodentalium wishes to obtain a fulcrum and keep its place in

the sand. The foot of Niicida and Leda is somewhat similar, its disk when ex-

panded resembling the leaf of a palm. Another species oi Siphonodentalium pro-

per is Dentalium quinquanyidare of Forbes, from the ^gean (80-230 fathoms),

which M'Audrew afterwards dredged off the coasts of Portugal and Spain in

5-30 fathoms, and named (lapsii calami) D. 5"af?'"«'i^M^«''^; this species Sars

lately procured from the Loffoden Isles and Christianiafiord in 50-300 fathoms,

and described as S.pentacjonum. The coincidence of the first and last of these

mayspecific names is curious. Z>. ^/crt/'(7i«<H«i of Deshayes (a tertiary fossil)

also be referable to the genus Siphonodentalium. D. hijissum of Searles Wood,

from the Coralline Crag, is possibly the type of another genus, for which I

would suggest the name of Dischides. This species has been dredged in a

living state off Gibraltar by Mr. M'Audrew *. I suspected that D. hijissum

might be the tube of a young Teredo norvegica, on account of its having a

myseptal jjrocess within the posterior orifice : at all events  remark is justi-

fied by the affinity which exists between the Teredinidce and the Soleno-

conchia.

The second species of this class is

          Cadulus suhfusiformis, Sars

{Siphonodentalium subfusiforme, 1. c. p. 21, figs. 36-44), having a Korwegian
distribution equally extensive with that of S. Lofotense, but attaining a greater
deptli, viz. from 50 to 300 fathoms. I noticed specimens among the fossils
collected last year by Messrs. Crosskey and Eobertson in a raised sea-bed at
Barholmen, near Christiania. It occiirred on the Unst ground, in 80-90
fathoms, and was apparently not rare. Mr. Peach detected a specimen in
looking over some sand which I dredged there in 1864 ; this I at the time

regarded as a Diirypa. The margin of the posterior orifice lias two slight

indentations  or notches, one on each  side                        and Sars's statement that  the margin

is entire was perhaps founded on imperfect specimens. C. suhfusifonnis rnay

be known from C. (/aclns not only by its much smaller size, but also by having

the greatest width' or diameter in the middle (instead of in the upper or ante-

rior part), and by the posterior or narrower part being abruptly curtailed. C.

gaclus is awl-shaped, and has a tapering extremity; C. suhfusifonnis is gibbous.

Whether C. aadus inhabits our seas is questionable. Montagu says*, " This is

a pelagic species, found in many parts of the British Channel, and is Imown to

mariners by the name of ' hake's tooth,' who frequently find it within sound-

ings, adhering to the log-line (as we are informed), but most likelj' to the

Myplumb-line."  specimens are from the collections of Dr. Turton and Mr.

George Humjihreys ; the latter dealt almost exclusively in exotic shells. Eaug

placed D. gadus in his genus Greseis, among the Ptcropoda ; but Philippi

rightly objected to such a classification, because the shells of all Pteropods are

closed at the smaller endf.

The sixth and last addition to our molluscan fauna is

                                        Utriculus globosus, Lovcn

{Ampliisphyra (jlohosa, Ind. Moll. Scand. p. 11). Two living specimens Avcre
dredged in St. Magnus Bay, with Ledapernula and Siphonodentaliiun Lofotense.

Its distribution, according to Professor Loven, extended from Finmark to
Bohusliiu in the south of Sweden; and through the kindness of the discoverer
and Professor Lilljcborg I have been enabled to compare the Shetland speci-
mens with those from the Scandinavian coasts. I mention this, because
(before I was thus favoured, and when I had only Lovcn's description to
consult) I mistook this species for another, which I have lately described

--as U. ventrosus, from Skyc.
   2. Geocirapliicid disfrihution. The accompanying listj of all the MoUusca
hitherto observed in Shetland and the adjacent seas will serve to show the
relations which exist between these and the MoUusca of the north and south
of Europe. The number of Shetland species is 3G3, of which 315 inhabit the
north and 245 the south of Europe. The total number of species of British
MoUusca, so far as I have yet worked out the subject, is 712. It may be
remarked what a scanty proportion the land and freshwater MoUusca of Shet-
land bear to those of Great Britain, viz. 23 species only out of 122. The marine

--species, however, are 340 out of 590 although the Zetlandic Nudibranchs

and Cuttles have not been weU examined, and, of the former, 28 only out of

110 have been as yet observed.

    Some species are now for the first time recorded as Zetlandic, e. g. Terehra-

 ieUa Spitzhcrgensis, Montaeiita tumidida, SipiJwnodentcdimn Lofotense, Cadidus
suhfusifornris, Rissoa proxima, Odostomia clavida, and Utriculus glohosus. Other
 species, cither rare or local, -which I had previously dredged on the eastern and
 northern coasts, were found this year on the western coast also. Such are

 Fecten Testce, Lima Sarsii, L. elliptica, Led(( prrnuJa, A.rinns ferruginosus,

   3. Habits of Animals.Species whicli were supposed to inhabit shallow
Avater ouly were found living at considerable depths. In this category may

be mentioned JSrUica catena, which was dredged alive in from 40 to 5U fathoms.

Capt. Thomas informs me that he also dredged this species in the Orkuejs Hving

Aat the same depth.                                                                             dead specimen of iStdifer Tartoiu was procured with

Natica catena. Bathymetrical conditions are not of so much couseriuence to

Wcthe Mollusca as a suitable habitation and a good feeding-ground.                                                                         had
--the good fortune of dredging in 170 fathoms a greater depth than had been

previously explored in the British seas. This was about forty miles N.N.W.

of TJust. The grormd was stony intermixed with patches of sand. The greatest

depth recorded as having been dredged in our seas was 145 fathoms, by Admi-

ral Beechey, oif the Mull of GaUoway. The following is a list of the Mollusca

which I examined from om- dredging in 170 fathoms :

   Living. Beachiopoda : Terebratida cranium, young; T. cujjut-serijentis,
young ; Crania anomula. Conchifeea : Anomia ephippium, young ; A. patel-
liformis, var. striata ; Lima suhauriculata, young; Leda pugma^a ; Montacuta

srdjstriata, on h^patancjus meridionalis ; Venus ovata ; Lucinopisis vndata,
young; Sa.vicava rugosa. Solenoconchia : Beniallum entalis, var. amdata.
Gastropoda : Trochus occidentalis; Eulima bilineata; Natica Montacuti; Tro-

plion Barvicensis.

                                                                                             :                                                                                                          ;

P. sinulis, a single valve ; C'renella decussaia, fragments ; Nucula nucleus, single

valves; N. tenuis, ditto; Leda minuta, a single valve; Limopsis aurita, small

but fresh single valves; Area pectunculoides, single valves; Lucina borealis,

Cperfect; A.vinus Croulinensis, single valves; Cardium fasciatitm, ditto;

minimum, ditto; Astarte sidcata, ditto; Venus lincta, ditto; Tellina bcdaus-

tina, a fragment ; Psammobia Ferroensis, ditto ; Mactra solida, var. elliptica,

single valves ; Scrobicxdaria prismatica, i^ fragment; Thracia papyvacea, var,
villosiuscula, young ; JVecera cusiyidata, a fragment. Gastropoda : Tectura

fulva, Yar.cdbula; Propilidium ancyloides ; Emarginidajissura; Trochus ania-
bilis, young; T. millegranus, ditto; Turritella terebra, var. nivea; Natica

Alderi; Trichotropis borecdis; Buccinopsis Dalei, a fragment; Fustis gracilis,
yoimg ; F. p)ropinc[uus, ditto ; Defrancia teres; D. linearis, var. eequalis, a
fragment; Pleurotoma costata, ditto; Cyliclina alba, ditto. Pteeopoda :

fSjiiricdis retroversus ; Clio or Cleodorapyramidata, a fragment.

 --Of these species sixteen were living, and thirty-eight dead in all, fifty-

four. They comprised some rarities, viz. Terebratula cranium, Limopsis aurita,
Axinus Croulinensis, Trochus amabilis, Buccinopsis Dcdei, and Cyliclina alba.
The shells were of the usual colour ; indeed this was brighter and darker in

living specimens of Venus ovata and Eulima bilineata than in average examples
of the same species taken in a few fathoms. The notion that colour is absent

--or fainter in shells from deep water seems to be quite ixnfounded.
    4. Geological Relations. Fossil shells (being apparently relics of the glacial

epoch) occurred in 170fathoms,and higher up to 80 fathoms. They were chiefly

Pecten Islandicus, Tellina calcaria, Mya trimccda, var. Uddevallensis, Saxicava

rugosa, var. Uddevallensis, Mblleria costulata, and Trochus cinereus. All these
species and varieties inhabit high northern latitudes, and none of them have

been discovered li^-ing in our seas. No sirch fossils were detected on any part

of the western coast of Shetland.

--43G REPORT 1867.

85 fathoms, ou a soft saudy bottom, twenty-live miles N.N.W. of Unst, I

found the canine tooth of an animal of the weasel tribe ; and Mr. "Waller found

the shoulder-blade of a much smaller quadruped. These occurred within a

comparatively small space, although not together, and they were unaccom-

panied by any other land organisms. The socket of the tooth and the bone

were eroded. It is possible that the tooth was that of a tame ferret, which was

accidentally killed in 1862 and thrown into the sea in Balta Sound, at a dis-

tance of about thirty-five miles from the place where the tooth Avas dredged. The

tide sets with great rapidity in that directioa ; and when the carcase became

distended by the gases evolved during putrefaction, it must have floated for

some time. The bone is supposed by ^ilr. Eoyd Dawkius to be that of a bat

this may have been eaten by a snowy owl, and disgorged or voided on its way

back to the Faroe Isles or Iceland. I mention this curious circumstance to

show that some bones of quadrupeds as well as of man may be preserved for a

long time iu " the slimy bottom of the deep," without being disturbed by the

naturalist. When we consider the vast extent of the sea- bed, and the very

trifling and unfrequent operations of the dredge (the one being measured by

square nautical degrees, and the other by square yards), we ought not to be

-- --surprised that the remains of drowned mariners at least their teeth are not

thus brought to light. Clarence's dream (the creation of a sublime poet) is

never likely to be verified by modern research.

I have had much pleasiu-e in presenting a collection of the rarer shells to

our national Museum.

   Subjoined are letters from Dr. Giinther and Mr. Boyd Dawkius :--

 --"Deak Sir, The fishes collected by you by means of the dredge, at a

depth of from 80 to 90 fathoms, at the Shetland Islands, belong to four species,

diterranean species viz. a Dragonet, CaUionymiis mactdatus (Bonap.) and a

Sand-Launce, A)iuiwdi/tes sinihis (Swains.). The two others appear to be un-

described: one is a llockling, distinguished by its very large ej'cs, for which

I propose the name of Motdla macroj)lithalma ; the second a Gobj', which I
dedicate to its discoverer render the name of Gohiu^ Jcffrei/siL I will furnish

  --"Mi' DEAR Sin, I have carefully examined the remains found under such

interesting circumstances. The tooth approaches nearer to the left lower

canine of the ferret {Piitorins furo) than to any other teeth in the Museum of
the CoUege of Surgeons. From so small a portion I can hardly infer the species
of the animal ; but if its possessor was not a Ferret, he was a Ferret's fir.st
cousin, one of the Mustelines, who died in the prime of life. The corrosion of

the fang is very curious, and cannot be the result of the waste of the sea : it
seems to be the result of the action of an acid, which has been prevented from
attacking the crown b)- the crj'stalliue structure of the enamel. Nearly all

the gelatine has disa])pcared from the fang. Its age would be best arrived at

by the character of the sea-bottom. If from a muddy deposit, probably it is

of that age ; if from a rocky bottom, its age is altogether uncertain. It is not

more recent-looking than many of the Pleistocene bones I have dug out of
caverns. The second fragment seems to be a portion of the scapula of a bat

but its condition does not allow of a very accurate determination. If the two

were dredged up near each other, there is probably a deposit of bones at the

spot whence they were obtained, similar to that of the east coast. Their dis-

covery is of very great interest, and I am only sorry that I can add so little to

their elucidation.         " I am, my dear Sir,

" J. Gwyn Jeffreys, Esq.   Yours truly,

   P..S. I may add that, before I left Shetland, Dr. Saxby kindly undertook, at
my suggestion, to ascertain whether mammalian bones deposited in the sea

would be eroded, and by what means.

Preliminary Report on the Crustacea, Molluscoicla, Echinodermata,
   and Ccelenteraia, procured by the Shetland Dredging Committee in

   1867. By the Rev. Alfred Merle Norman, M.A.

The further investigation is carried on in the Shetland seas, the more deeply

interesting does the study of the fauna of that portion of our country become.

--Dredging in the depths of those northern waters, in which there is almost

invariably a heavy sea, at one time sweeping across the Atlantic, at another

rolling away from Greenland, at another (as was the case for many weeks
together during the present summer) running from Spitzbergcu and the ice-

floes of the Arctic Ocean, accompanied by a keen, cutting north-east wind,
is not altogether pleasant work for the naturalist. Yet, trying and difficult

though the dredging may be, there is none to be compared with it in the
British Islands ; and every fresh summer your Dredging Committee have

spent in investigating the marine fauna of Shetland, they have returned

home only the more convinced of the greatness of the field of research which
remains to be explored. Every square mile of the sea seems to have trea-
sures to give up unknown to us before ; and the extent of the riches which

lie there, one, two, three, four hundred fathoms deep, Avill perhaps never be

known in our day. The extreme interest which attaches to the Shetland

sea is the circumstance that it is the trysting place of the northern and

southern faunas : the warm influence of the Gulf-stream impinging on the
western coast coaxes on many a species of sunnier climes to extend its naigra-

tion northwards, while the cold winds and waves which issue from the Pole
and come drifting round the IS^orth Cape and Loffoden Isles, account for the

many Arctic forms which, stunted in size and numerically scarce, are yet

able in the equable temperature of the abyss of the Shetland waters to hold
out against those southern influences so detrimental to tlulr constitutions.

The product of the dredging of the present year promises a rich harvest of
additions to the British fauna ; and in those classes of which I more espe-
cially undertake the examination I have ali-eady found most important
results ; at the same time the few notes which at this time are given must
be only regarded in the light of a preliminarj^ report. The passing of every
specimen under the microscope, as must be done in the determining of all
the smaller Crustacea, Hydrozoa, ikc, and the dissection and mounting of
every specimen of the former not at once recognized, is necessarily a work
of time ; and very much remains to be examined, especially among the

Copepoda, Ostracoda, &c.

438 REPORT-- 1867.

                                                                                          Crttstacea.

First wc will take the Crustacea. In my Eeport of Hobridean Dredging

last J'ear, I traced the genus Xantho northwards as far as the Isle of Mull;

and I have now to record the occurrence of a young specimen of X. rivulosa

Asome 350 miles further north, off the Island of Balta.                                                fine undescribed

Par/itnis is perhaps nearest allied to P. cuanensis. The hand is remarkably

broad, the finger esjiecially so, and is furnished with three much elevated

ribs, one at each margin, and the third central ; the margins are denticulately

spined, and the wrist and upper edge of the second and third legs are also

spinous ; the species may be named Paguras tvicarlnatus. Among the My-

sidea are two genera not yet recorded as British. Nematoinis serrutus, G. 0.

Sars, differs from Mysis chiefly in the structure of the abdominal feet and of

the central tail-plate ; the species, when alive, is a beautiful little thing,

having its white body prettily painted with red, and the eyes, which are

large and kidney-shaped, of a brilliant ruby colour. The other genus is one

which I would establish (Gastrosaccus) for the reception of the Mysis sancta

=of Van Beueden ( M. spinifera, Goes); the marsupial pouch, instead of

being an appendage, as in Mysis, of the last two thoracic legs, is attached to

the last thoracic and first abdominal feet ; and the first abdominal feet in the

female, instead of being the smallest, are the most fully developed, and con-

sist of an elongated basal joint and two short branches ; while in the male

the third abdominal foot is the more especially developed sexual organ.

Gastrosaccus sanctus, though now first recorded, has been for many years in

my collection, and was first sent to me bj- Mr. Edward, of Banff, who pro-

cured it in the Mora}' Firth. Mysis Jlexuosa, Spiritus, vulgaris, Griffithsim

and DidelpJiys                                                                 Diasfylis  lamdlata, Iphithoe serrafa, and Lamprops rosea
                                                                            ;

were the remaining Stomapods.

Among the Amphipoda the difficult family Lysianassidse is well repre-

sented by Callisoma crenata, Anony.v lonyii-ornis, lovyipes, mimttus, ohesus,

=andi HoVydlVd ( denficuhitus, Bate), and by three additions to our fauna,

Anony.v nanoides of Lilljeboi'g, procured among Laminariac at Lerwick and

at Hillswick, Anonyx tumidus of Kroycr, found in a sponge dredged thirty-

five miles N'.jS'.W. of Unst in 170 fathoms, and Stegocepludus ampidla,

Phipps. This last truly arctic species was dredged in 60-70 fathoms in

St. Magnus Bay ; the single specimen procured is, as compared witli Spitz-

bergen examples, for which I am indebted to Professor Loven, as a pigmj- to

giants, bearing about tlie same proportionate size to its northern brethren as

do the Leda permda, taken in the same spot, to their Greenland relatives.

Indeed, as a rule, those arctic Amphipods, which occur also on the British

-- --coast for example, Gammnnis Jocvsta and AmatliiUa Sahini attain a much

greater dcvelojiment within the Arctic circle. The Anony.v tumidus, how-

ever, of Shetland, shows no difference of size from Spitzbergcn specimens. It

may be questioned, however, whether this is a truly arctic species ; for

although long known in the north, it has recently been recorded by Professor

HeUer from the Adriatic Sea ; and its discovery this year in Slietland gives

an intermediate locality. The fact that it is an cssentiallj' parasitic species,

which is never found except either in the branchial sac of Tunicata or in

sponges, and that it is also an inhabitant of very deep water, may have led

to its having been hitherto overlooked.

   Passing over all other Amphipoda hitherto known to our fauna, I have to

--announce the following important additions : a species allied apparently to
                                                                     -;

Callioj> his, having subequal ovate gnathopods ; but the peduncles of the an

tennte are longer and the flagclla shorter than is usual in that genus, and
the meros of the pereiopods is not produced backwards and downwards ; a

Plemtes (?), with smooth bod)-, and hands somewhat resembling in structure
those of the second pair in AmiiliUoclius mcimidens, Bate, with the palm
similarly crenated, but much more obhque ; a now genus allied in general

characters of eyes, of gnathopods, and pereiopods, especially in the broadly
flattened meros and carpus of the last pair, to Haploops, but having the an-
tennfc furnished with an appendage ; an Atijlus, remarkable on account of
the extraordinary length and slcndcrness of the legs, and having the hinder
margin of all the abdominal segments serrate across the back with a larger
central spine ; a Cijrtophium, having the segments of the body furnished with

spine-formed tubercles, which are much larger than those of C. tulercularis,
Bruzelius, from which it also differs in having the hand of the second gna-

thopods shorter and broader, and the spine of the meros large and strong
and a Coroplilum, with longer posterior uropods and less strongly developed

antennae than the species hitherto described.

   Of Isopoda the very rare species Paratanais rigidus, B. & W., Phryxus
&ahdomincdis, parasitical in HippoJijte pitsiola, Leptaspidia hrevipes, B. W.,
&and Cirolana splnipes, B. "W., were found, together with what appears to
be a new species of the last genus. The form comes nearest to the yEga

cremdata of Liitken, agreeing with it in having the telson truncated and
denticulate at the extremity ; the general outline of the telson, however,

differs from Liitken's figure, and the uropods are of different form.

  My attention was especially directed during the expedition to the Ento-

mostraca, and an enormous stock of material has been accumulated for

examination. It has as yet scarcely been touched, but the following new

things have already been observed. First and foremost is C'l/pridina Nor-

--vegica of Baird the largest of all European Ostracoda ; next is a very fine

arctic Cythereis, Cgthereis costatu of Brady, only known previously from the

Hunde Islands ; Pontocupris luspida, C'l/thereis cremdata, and Cythereis ahys-

sicola are species recently described by G. 0. Sars from the jSTorwegian seas
and besides these there are four species of Cyiliere, one Cytheridea, two
Cythenira (including by far the finest species of the genus yet known), and
a species allied perhaps to ArglUcecki cyUndrica of Sars, which appear tobe

new to science. There are also several members of the famihes Altcuthklce
and Barpactkidce, together with a curious form, parasitic in Dklemnaum
qelatinosum, which I am unable as yet to determine, and believe to be

undescribed.

    The very rare and curious burrowing barnacle, Akippje hmpas, Hancock,

was inhabiting sheUs of Fusus aniirpnts, dredged five miles off Balta.

               Ttjxicata.

The Tunicata dredged were very few, but included Ascklia rudis, Alder, a

large species discovered in 1861, and this year procured between the^Islands

of Whalsey and Balta. In a cave in St. Magnus Bay, Thyhciiim Kormani,
mAlder, was living in great numbers ; it was only previoiisly known
                                                                     the

Channel Islands, where it covers a large portion of the side of the^ famous

Gouliot Cave. Salpa runcinata was met with in some numbers in the open

sea thirty miles N.N.W. of Burrafirth Lighthouse, but was not observed

nearer shore.

                         POLYZOA.

Two or three fragments of the beautiful coral Ilonicra vlolacea of 8ars
Awere dredged between Balta and Whalsey in 40-50 fathoms.
                                                           fine spe-

cimen procured by Mr. Barlee has long been in my collection. I found it

among his Polyzoa bequeathed to me marked " Shetland." The confirmation

of the discovery is, however, of importance, and this fine addition to our

Afauna is now for the first time made public.  very remarkable Lepralia,

found between tidcmarks at Balta, differs widely from all known species.

The mouth of the hyaline, punctate, ovate cells, instead of being sessile, is

elevated to the extremity of a long tube which rises from the poljzoary

Aimmediately beloW the origin of this tube is an ovate avicularium.  small

patch of this species, consisting of a few cells only, in a very imperfect state,

which I had met with among the things procured in Shetland by Mr. Barlee,

-was sent by me some years ago to Professor Busk, who attached to them the

manuscript name Lcpralia tuhulosa, a title which the species may most

appropriately bear. There is also a new Escliava, and a few other species

were found 'which are additions to the very long list of Shetland Polyzoa

previously known to me.

                         ECHINODEBMAT.i..

Among the Echinodermata the fact of Cidaris papillata and Spatangus

meridionalis having been dredged in considerable numbers, living in lOO-llO

fathoms, about thirty miles N.N.W. of Unst, is extremely interesting. The

Cidaris has never before been dredged in our seas, the few specimens known

Wehaving been obtained from fishermen's lines.  kept it alive for some

time, and found it to be remarkably sluggish in its movements. The Spa-

tangus was not known anywhere north of the Mediterranean until 1864,

when two specimens were obtained near the same spot in which it has this

Ayear been met with in greater profusion.  second British specimen of

Arcliaster Parelii was found near the same spot as the species just referred to.

An Echmocardimn was dredged by Mr. M'Andrew many years ago on the

south side of Brcssay Island, Shetland, and described and figured in the

'Annals of Natural History' for 1857, under the name oi Ainphidohis fjih-

bosus of Agassiz. The species was dredged this year in St. Magnus Bay, and

I have seen a second specimen procured by Mr. D. Robertson in the Clyde

district, and a third found by jMr. Hodge on the Durham coast. It is most

certainij' not the Amphidetus fjihhosus of Agassiz, and I would propose to call

it Echinocardium pcnnatijidu»i, on account of the character of the pedicel-

lariae, which are very different from the same organs in E. ovatum, its nearest

   Lastly, in briefly noticing the Coelenterata, it is worthy of mention that
Sfomphia Churchia\ Bulocern Tuedicr, and Pennatida phospliorea , the last in
most extraordinary profusion, were found in St. Magnus Bay, and that Ehizo-
cline areolata, Merona cornucopia;, and Dkoryne conferta, live in about 50
fathoms, five to seven miles off Balta. In company with these last were
thousands of a ZoantJius, which sometimes lives entirely free, at others coats
the shells of small univalve moUusca and then destroys their substance. This

Zoanthus is, I believe, the Z. incrustatus of Scandinavian writers, and I am
now perfectly satisfied that it is distinct from the Zoanthus Couchii, and

from a form, perhaps also distinct from Z. CoucJiii, which was found on this

and on previous occasions in Shetland inhabiting very deep water and living
parasitic upon sponges, thus being of similar habit to that species which has

excited so much controversy lately, which lives upon Hyalonema miraUlis.

In the open sea to the north of Unst I had the delight of seeing in profusion
two lovely oceanic Hydrozoa belonging to the genera Diphyes and Physoplwra.

Unfortunately having no works upon the subject with me I was imable to

determine the species, but I believe the former to have been D. appendiculata.
Diphyes has only once before been observed in British waters, and Physo-

2jhora was not known to inhabit them. The rapidity of growth in Diphyes
is extraordinary, the coenosarc of a specimen kept alive was developed nearly

three inches in a single night.

   These notes are necessarily brief, and I fear may have proved dry and un-

interesting to the majority of the members in consequence of that very

brevity. My excuse must be that it is much more easy to draw up a report

of general interest when little has been done, and the habits and life-history

of some particular animals can be dilated upon, than it is so to summarize the
discoveries of a successful expedition as to make them in their necessarily

condensed form interesting to others than piirely scientific naturalists.

         Report on the Foraminifera obtained in the Shetland Seas.

                              By Edward Waller.

In making a report of the Foraminifera obtained in the several dredging ex-
peditions to the Shetland Islands, undertaken by Mr. Jeffreys and his com-
panions from 1861 to the present year (in all of which, except that of 1863,
I was a party), it was a matter of immediate importance to consider some of
the works recently published on the British Foraminifera, for the purpose of
deciding upon the mode of classification, the nomenclature, and the enumera-
tion to be adopted in presenting the results of our explorations.

   Mr. Williamson's recent ' Foraminifera of Great Britain,' published by the
Hay Society in 1858, illustrated with admirable plates, and containing gene-
rally very lucid descriptions, will necessarily be in the hands of aU studying

the British F"'oraminifera, and may be taken, -without much change, as afford-
ing a fair representation of the then known forms which were sufficiently
distinct to be named and figured.

   The beauty of the objects and the information in the book will, doubtless,
soon stimulate explorers elsewhere, as they have done on the Scottish and
Durham coasts, to make additions to our species.

   The subsequent work of Dr. Carpenter on the study of the Foraminifera,
published by the Bay Society in 1862, was based on very extended inquiries
into both recent and fossil Foraminifera by himself and Messrs. Parker and
Jones, and opened up views of classification which differed very much from
previous modes, including Mr. "Williamson's.

    Dr. Carpenter's system has regard more to th construction of the animal
inhabitant than to the outline of the shelly covering, and seems at once to
have a more natural foundation, and, from certain characters of the shell,
suited to the animal construction, to afford a more obvious andacciirate divi-
sion of the objects. The new arrangement requires a considerable change in
the names of species, &c.

    I propose, therefore, in the appended list to follow the classification and
nearly the nomenclature of Dr. Carpenter and his colleagues, and to take Mr.
--44i3
REPORT 1867.

Williamson's ^yo^k as a bayis for the enumeration of tho various forms of our

recent Foraminifera.

   In taking this course, I but follow in the steps of Mr. H. B. Brady, who

published in the Transactions of the Linnean Society, vol. xxiv., a list of the
Shetland Foraminifera, derived principally from dredgings furnished by Mr.

Jeffreys and myself, with some additions from my own examinations. His

catalogue has been so carefully constructed, and his investigation of any
doubtful species introduced into Mr. Williamson's book on questionable

authority has been so full, that I am relieved from difficulties I should
otherwise have been unable to surmount within tho time elapsed since my

return from the Shctlauds, and I have little to do except to continue his work
up to the present time.

    Mr. Williamson describes 104 species and varieties, of which Mr. Brady
remarks that three are most probably fossil, and that two others have been
Avithdrawn as Mediterranean, introduced by accident. Deducting these, there

remain 99 recent British Foraminifera known at that time. Mr. Brady, in his
Shetland list, gives 92 of those, and adds 19 new forms, making 111 in that

district, and 118 in Britain. Mr. Brady, in vol. i. of the Natural History
Transactions of Northumberland and Diu-ham, describes from those coasts 6

Foraminifera new to Britain ; and in his report to this Association on the

Foraminifera of the Hebrides as resulting from Mr. Jeifreys's dredging in

1866, he gives eleven more species, and I now add from the Shctlauds one
more new to Britain, raising its list to 136. I have also found four of the
new Durham species in dredgings of 1864, but too late for Mr. Brady's pub-
lications, and in the present year's examinations three of the new forms of

the Hebrides and two of Mr. \Yilliamson's not before noted, thus bringing up
the Shetland list to 121, or within 15 of the whole British forms.

   That of those 136 species or varieties from the entire range of the British
coasts so large a proportion as 121 should be found in a limited district at
one extremity of tho empire, is a result which I believe could scarcely be ob-
tained in any other department of natural history ; and it may, perhaps, be
no unfair conclusion, from this and their bathymetrical conditions, that slight
changes of climate ]iave little influence on those low forms of life, while depth

of water has greater power of hmitatiou, some species being only known

close to the shore or in very shallow water, while in the great depths are foi;nd

only a few and different forms. It is, however, true that by the advance
northward the Shetland Foraminifera approach more nearly to the Norwegian
species and varieties than do those of the southern parts of England and

Ireland.

   I have many specimens from this year's dredgings which will require
considerable time to work out satisfactorily. Some of them have been Idndly

examined by Mr. Rupert Jones, and I hope for his further assistance ; and I

expect that, in conjunction with Mr. Brady, I may be able, at no distant time,
to have them fully described and figured. There are new forms of i?(7ocw?(«ff,
Gdudrtjina, Dlmorpliina, Cornuspira and, I believe, FoJytrema, which wUl
afford considerable additions to our known species, and, I think, prove that

our Shetland dredgings have given satisfactory results in this branch of our

fauna.

   Such an opportunity occurred to Mr. J. Gwyn Jeffreys, who, during his ex-

ploration of the marine invertebrate fauna of the Shetland Islands, preserved the
specimens of fishes which were brought up in the dredge from a depth of from
80 to 90 fathoms. Small as the number of specimens is, the result of their
examination proved to be most interesting and satisfactory, inasmueh as they

belong to four species new to the British fauna, two being new to science,
viz. Ammodytes simlus (Swains.), MoteUa macroplithahna (sp. n.), CalUony-
mus maculatus (Bonap.), and Gobius Jeff'rei/sii (sp. n.). On former occa-

sions I have pointed out that the geographical range of deep-sea fishes
appears to be extended in proportion to the vertical depth inliabited by them,
and that they are either distinguished by an increased size of the eye to col-

lect as many rays of light as possible, or by a rudimentary condition of that

organ, as is the case with fishes inhabiting caves. Q'his is in some measure
verified by the species collected by Mr. Jeffrej^s, which, however, it must be

remembered, inhabit a much less depth than Regalecus, PJagijodus, &c. Two

of them (CaUioni/mus maculatus and Ammodytes siiulus) were pre%'iously
known as occurring in the Mediterranean ; and the eyes of tliree of them
are conspicuously larger than in their congeners (^Ammodytes lancea, CaUio-
nymus hjra, and Motella tricirrata).

   This species has three barbels, one at each of the anterior nostrils and one
at the chin. It is distinguished from specimens of the same size of the
other three-bearded species by its large eye, the diameter of which, in the
specimen obtained, is as long as the snout, one-fourth of the length of the

head, and much longer than the width of the interorbital space. The teeth
of the mandible are very unequal in size, some being canine-like. The ante-

rior ray of the rudimentary first dorsal fin is about as long as the eye. D. 55.

the snout relatively to the diameter of the eye.

latter species is said to have the interorbital space broader, its width being

equal to one half of the diameter of the eye (Cuv. & Yal. xii. p. 50) ; and
M'Coy, who examined two Irish examples, describes the snout as " very

short, tumid, and convex," which character cannot be applied to 0. Jef-

YoTJR Committee consider it will be convenient that the present Report should

be so arranged as    readily to  compare  with  the  previous  one                       the  different
                                                                                      ;

branches of rainfall investigation are therefore classed under the same head-

ings as in the last Eeport, and new branches are noticed subsequently.

 --1. Extraction and Classification ofpuhlislied liccords. This very important

work, which was temporarily suspended to allow of more urgent matters

being  pressed  on,  has  now been  resumed,  and will be  steadily pursued                                                                      it may

be desirable to state that its completion must not be expected for some few

years ; the labour involved is excessive, but time and pei'severance will ensure
the accomplishment of the work, a work not for present use alone, but of the

--greatest service to all future inquirers.
   2. Examination of liain-yaur/es. Steady progress has been made in this
matter, Mr. Symons having during the year visited and tested sixty gauges
full details of the examinations are annexed to this Keport. By refei'ence to

the list of stations in the British Association Report, 1865, pp. 192-242, it
will be seen that ncai-ly every gauge in the counties of Kent and Sussex has

--been visited and tested.
   3. Inclined and Tipping Funnelled Gauyes. These instruments were fuUy

described in the last Report ; Mr. Chrimes, who kindly undertook the entire

cost of the erection and maintenance of these instruments, has continued the

observations, which it affords us miich pleas ui-e to state will shortly be

examined by Professor Phillips.

 --4. LiJJnence of liiver 2Iists on the Amount of Rain collected. This question

remains exactly in the same position as at the Itime of our last Report, since

the follo-wing suggestion, thrown out by Mr. Symons in " British RainfiUl,

1S6G," p. 7, has met with no response, " I feel rather beaten by these diffi-
culties, and do not see how to solve the original proposition of detex'mining

the influence of river mists on the amount of rain collected, unless it be bj-

transferring the Shepperton gauges to some flat dry district, tolerably uniform

in its level, with a lai-ge piece of ornamental water, and then the gauge

might either be placed on au island, if free from trees, or float moored in the
centre of a pond or lake. If any observer can offer these conditions, I shall
gladly place the instruments at his service, as the expediency of con-
tinuing them in their present state seems doubtful."

 --5. Additional Jlain-(/auffes in Derbi/shire. The remarkable geological

formation of this beautiful county has specially marked it out as a field of
rainfall research ; some valuable but fragmentary observations were made by
Mr. Bateman on the rainfall in the neighboiu-hood of the Peak, and observa-
tions have long been taken at Combs Moss, Chapel-en-le-Frith, Woodhead,
and other stations in the ]S".W. of the county; from 17G1 to 1813 a very
regular record was kept at Chatsworth ; for a quarter of a century Mr. Davis
has been observing with great care at Derby, having been preceded in the
same town by Mr. Swanwick, wlio also observed for twenty-five years at the

beginning of the century. From this it may be inferred that the mean fall,

and the secular variation of annual fall, at certain points in the county are

pretty well determined ; but hitherto we have had httle or no information as

to the relative fall in different parts of the county, and specially in that most
interesting district which lies between Ambergate and Eowsley, having Mat-
lock for its centre. Cordially assisted by the Hon. and Rev. 0. AV. Forester,

the Eev. J. M. Mello, and Mr. Davis of Derby, we have the pleasui-e of

noticing considerable progress in the investigation of this question. There

are still deficiencies in some parts of the coiiutj^ which we purpose bringing

before the residents so as to render the cordon of stations complete.

  --6. Additional Gaihges in the Lake-district. The erection of any more

rain-gauges in the English Lakes may at first sight appear superfluous and
undesirable, but a little explanation we-svill, think, convince all that their
organization by Mr. Symons is a most important step in rainfall work. Up
to 1844 we believe no greater annual fall than 90 inches had been recorded

in any part of the British Isles. Dr. Miller, of AATiitehavcn, planted a gauge
at Ennerdale Lake in November 1843, and yearly increased and varied his
stations until the fall in the valleys of Wastdale and Borrowdale, and " Sea-

thwaite " and " The Stye," became with meteorologists as well known as
London or Dundee. In 1853 these were all discontinued, save those in
charge of Mr. Dixon at Seathwaite and the Stye. In 1864 Isaac Fletcher,

Esq., F.R.S., of Tarn Bank, reorganized the stations in these valleys, while
some of the other valleys were taken charge of by other observers ; this being

the condition of affairs in Cumberland, and Captain Mathew having at the same

time undertaken to investigate the fall of rain in the Snowdonian range, Mr.
Symons felt that this was an especially eligible time for examining if the
remarkable falls* so clearly proved to exist in the vicinity of ScawfeU extend
far therefrom ; and for this purpose he devoted nearly two months last autumn
to personally superintending the erection of gauges in parts of the Lake-
district far removed from the sites of the other gauges, out of the ordinary

routes of tourists, and, as some woiild have thought, out of the district of re-
markable rains. The results of these observations will be fully noticed in

 our next Eeport.

  --7. Percentage of Annucd Rain tvliich falls Monthly in different localities.

Under the head of "Extraction and Classification of puhlished Records," we

have explained that all available returns of the fall of rain at any time, and
in any part of the British Isles, are being carefully collected. These returns
are tabulated on sheets, whereof a facsimile is appended to this Eex^ort, and

       * In 1866 the euormous fall of 225 inches was measured at the Stye.

complete for England and for the ten years 1850-59 inclusive. The resiilts

are so striking and seem likely to have snch an important bearing on ques-

tions of water supply, and (probably to a less extent) on agricultural matters,

that we think it would be wrong to suppress them because we hope to report

fully on the subject next year, and that we shall best discharge our duty by

reporting the facts which have been ascertained, but prefixing the caution

that although these deductions are based on daily observations for ten years

at each of ninety stations, yet that this apparently fu-m basis is by no means

unassailable ; the laws that hold good in one ten years may not be so mark-

edly confirmed by other ten years, and those which hold south of the Tweed
may be reversed or modified in the sister coimtries. Table II, indicates the

results at present obtained.

 --8. Approximate Determination of the Height of Rain-gaw/e Stations above

Sea-level. There having been very many stations (perhaps 500 out of a

total of 1500) the altitude of which above the mean level of the sea was un-
known, considerable attention has been given to the determination of this

important element. Before noticing the steps we have recently taken, it
may be well to state briefiy what is meant by the apparently simple term
" height above mean sea-level," and to what extent this information is ob-
tainable. " Mean sea-level," otherwise called " Ordnance Datum," is the
mean height of the sea as recorded by the tide-gauge erected at Liverpool by

the Ordnance Survey Department, and it is the zero from which all their

altitudes are measured. The altitudes determined by the Ordnance Depart-

--ment have been published in two forms (1) in works entitled " Abstracts of

Spirit Levelling in England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland," wherein, as

the title imphes, are given the heights of certain marks, called Benchmarks,

(7I\) (^ut on milestones and other permanent objects along some of the

principal roads in the British Isles                                                                                                      (2) in the maps on the 6 -inch (and now
                                                                                                                                       ;

on some of the 1-inch) scale the altitude of many points are given, and

contour hues are also marked. This excellent system being in operation, it

may be asked why this Committee have done anything in the matter ; the

Wereply is very simple and, we think, conclusive.                                                                                                  have not attempted in

any way to supplant or encroach on the functions of the Ordnance Depart-

ment                       but we have  called  the  attention                                                                            of  our  observers  to the benefit de-

rivable from levelling to the nearest marks, sometimes on their own lodge-
gates, yet unknown to them. In this way we have endeavoured to popularize

and extend the benefits conferred by these government levels. But there are

many places ten, fifteen, or more miles from the nearest benchmark, and for

the benefit of observers thus situate, the following arrangements were made,
Notice was sent to about 800 rainfall observers that they would be doing

good service by taking careful readings of their barometers thrice daily (9 a.m.,

3 P.M., and 9 p.m.) for ten days. May 24th to June 2nd, 1867, entering them

on a printed form sent with the notice, and when filled returning the same to

Mr. Symons. These documents were then sorted into two groups, the one
comprising only returns from stations at which the index-error of the baro-
meter and its height above the mean level of the sea were known, and the
other group comprising those stations of which the height was unknown.
The returns having been carefully cleared of all errors, intercomparison of the
ultimate results has given us a secondary series of altitudes probably correct

to 10 or 20 feet, being accurate enough for, all rainfall purposes, these being

also available as primary stations should a repetition of the process be
necessary at any future time.

Report on the best means of providing for a uniformity of Weights

   and Measures, ivith reference to the Interests of Science. By a
   Committee, consisting of Sir John Bowring, The Rt. Hon. C. B.
   Adderley, M.P., Sir W. Armstrong, Mr. Samuel Brown, Mr.
   W. EwART, M.P., Mr. Capel H. Berger, Dr. Farr, Mr. Frank
   Fellows, Prof. Frankland, Mr. George Glover, Prof. Hennessy,
   Earl FoRTEscuE, Mr. Frederick Hendricks, Mr. James Hey-
   AvooD, Sir Robert Kane, Prof. Leone Levi, Prof. W. A. Miller,
   Prof. Rankine, Mr. C. W. Siemens, Col. Sykes, M.P., Prof. A.
   W. Williamson, Lord Wrottesley, Mr. James Yates, and Prof.
   Leone Levi, Secretary.

Since our reappointment at Ifottiugliam, your Committee have used their
best endeavours to diffuse the knowledge of the Metric System, with a view

to its extension throughout tlie world, and wc have the pleasure to report that

special and extensive opportunities have presented themselves for the purpose.
The advantage of having the principal items in the statistics of the United

Kingdom pubhshed in the terms of the Metric, as well as of the Imperial
System, a practice which has been most advantageously introduced in some
Government Departments, has been again brought by your Committee to the
notice of the Board of Trade ; but although this method has been repeatedly
recommended b^' the International Statistical Congress, and also by the Com-
mittee of the House of Commons in 1862, the request has not been granted.
Your Committee can scarcelj* admit that an arrangement, which would be
found so convenient to this and to foreign countries, and which would so

facilitate the general knowledge of the Metric System, should be refused

on the ground of clerical difficulties, or because it may cause a trifling ad-

ditional expenditure. The Committee hope that, on further consideration,
the Board of Trade will see the advantage of complying with the wishes

repeatedly expressed for such items of information.

   The Mural Standard, which has been the subject of so much care and
study, both as regards precision and material, has now been completed by

Mr. Casella, Scientific Instrument Makei- to the Admiralty, and is avaihable
for pubHc use. It is made of white glazed porcelain, which is httle affected
by changes of temperature, and combines cheapness with elegance. The two
units, the Yard and the Metre, with their divisions, authorized by law, are
there shown in contact, so as to admit of easy comparison. The Yard, divided
into feet, inches, and eighths of an inch, is painted in red; tlie Metre, divided

into decimetres, centimetres, and millimetres, in blue. By very careful obser-

vation, it has been found that the measures on this instrument are exact to
within the two hundred and fiftieth part of an inch, or the tenth part of a
millimetre. It is fitted in a mahogany frame, for suspension on the walls of
public buildings. Your Committee have ordered copies of the Mural Stan-
dard to be presented to the Board of Customs of London and Liverpool, tlie

University of Oxford, and the office of the \Yarden of the Standards. By the

kindness of Mr. Yates, a copy of the Mural Standard has also been presented
to the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers in Paris. It is much to be desired
that the Mural Standard be extensively made known, and your Committee
would recommend the same to the special attention of the Chambers of Com-
merce and municipal authorities.

    In February last, your Committee, in conjunction with the Council of
the British Brancli of the International Decimal Association, invited a con-
--

UNIFORMITY OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.  469

 ference with deputies from the Chambers of Commerce in the United King-
 dom, and the Consular authorities in London. The conference was hekl at
 the Society of Arts, imder the presidency of Sir John Bowring, and the fol-
 ing resolutions were unanimously passed :

    That the permissive use of Metric Weights and Measures in the United
Kingdom, without corresponding powers for legalizing authorized standards
 of the same, and the stamping of Metric Weights and Measures in use, is

calculated to cause much inconvenience in trade, and to frustrate the prac-

tical adoption of the system ; and that it is therefore desirable that the
Department of the Board of Trade charged with the custody of Imperial
Weights and Measures, be also authorized to provide and maintain the stan-
dards of Metric Weights and Measures, and to stamp and verify those in

general use.

    That in order to J^acilitate the use of the ^letric System, it is desirable
that the same be introduced into the public departments, especially in the
Post-office and the Customs, by the official preparation of the Tariff in
Metric eqiiivalents, with aiithority to levy duty according to the same and

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

the publication of the principal results of the statistics of the Board of Trade
in Metric and Imperial values.

    That this Conference recommend the Chambers of Commerce of the
United Kingdom to use means for promoting the volimtary use of the Metric
System among merchants, mauTifacturers, and tradesmen, such as the pre-

paration of special tables, available in the various trades, for converting

prices and quantities from the Metric into the Imperial System, and vice
versa ; and the exhibition of Mural Standards of the Metro in public places
in the principal ports and market-towns.

    That in the opinion of this Meeting, the International Monetary Con-
vention lately entered into by France, Italy, Belgium, and Switzerland, for
the puqDOse of giving a common weight, fineness, and currency to their stan-
dard Coins, is deserving approbation as a measure calculated to facilitate
and extend the commercial, banking, and exchange operations between
those nations themselves, and foreign countries having dealings with them.

   And this Meeting is further of opinion that the conditions of the Inter-
national Monetary Convention, so far as they may be foimd applicable to

the Metallic Currency System of the United Kingdom, are well worthy of

the attentive consideration and siipport of all who are interested in the j)ro-

gress of and intercommunication between nations.
   That it is desirable that the Chambers of Commerce should be repre-

sented at the Conference to be held in Paris in connexion with the special
Exhibition of Weights, Measures, and Coius, at the approaching Universal

Exhibition.

   The most important event, however, which is likely to exercise considerable

influence in the future discussion of the question, is the Conference held in
Paris at the suggestion of your Committee and of the Council of the Inter-

national Decimal Association. The Conference having been hold at a time

when Parliament was sitting and the Courts of Law were open, no large
representation could attend from this country, yet Mr. Samiicl Brown and

Professor Leone Levi attended on behalf of your Committee and they had the
advantage of having v^ith them Mr. Louis P. Casella, the constructor of the
Mural Standard, Mr. Muspratt and Mr. Blood, representing the Liverpool
Chamber of Commerce, and Mr. Joseph Wrigley, representing the Hudders-
field Chamber of Commerce. The Conference was attended by represent-

atives from many countries, including Austria, Spain, Portugal, Denmark,
        --                                                     :

470           --REPORT 1867.

Sweden, Norway, Prussia, Wurtembcrg, Bavaria, Prussia, Italy, Morocco,
Tunis, Brazil, South America, aud the United States ; and was presided over
by M. Mathieu, of the Institute. The first question discussed was that of

Weights and Measures, and a report was read on the subject, which was pre-

pared by M. Jacobi, of the Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg,

and adopted by the organizing Committee. Starting from certain fundamental

propositions in favour of the Decimal system of calculation and of the Metric

sj'stem especially, the report showed how far that system had been extended

in different coinatries, specifying those which have already adopted it entirely

and in an obligatory manner, such as France, Belgium, the Netlierlauds,

Italy, the Eoman States, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Mexico, Chili, Brazil, iSTew

Grenada, and other Republics of South America ; those which have more or

less borrowed from it, such as S'^itzerland, Baden, Prussia, Bavaria, Wur-

temberg, Austria, Denmark ; those which have introduced the Metric system

in a permanent manner, as the United Kingdom, and the United States ; aud
those which have nothing in common with the Metric system. Alter this

survey, the report entered into a detailed aceoiiut of the advantages which

woiild result from the use of the system in different branches of labour, in

the teaching of arithmetic in primary schools, in scientific researches and

memoirs, in commercial transactions, in industry and machinery, in jiostal

tariffs, telegraphs, and customs duties. As regards the use of its nomen-

clature, the report is not in favour of any material alteration, and far

less of using old names for new quantities ; nor does it favour the com-
bination of the old and new systems, such as the iise of the foot side by

side with the metre even in a period of transition. In conclusion, the re-

port recommended the immediate teaching of the Metric System in schools,

and the use of the same in statistical and other public docxunents. After

some discussion the report was jiut to the vote, and was carried unanimously.

Doubts having been expressed as to the exact correspondence between

the standards kept at the Archives and those at the Conservatoire des

Ai'ts et Metiers, and some uncertainty existing respecting the method to be

pursued for obtaining an exact standard in other countries, the prototype

being in Paris, General Morin and M. Tresca, Conservator and Subcon-

servator of the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers, stated that on the 5th

October, 1863, his Excellency the Minister of Agriculture, Commerce, and

PubUc "Works, had appointed a Commission, composed of themselves, with

M. Silberman, Conservator of the collections, and M. Proment, Constructor

of instruments, charged to make an official comparison between the pro-

totype standards kept at the ^ii'chives, with those deposited at the Impe-

rial Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers, more particularly destined to be used
for compaiisons with the standards made by or for the different govern-

ments which might adopt the Metric System. The prototype standard

Metre at the Archives is of platinum, has no inscription or mark whatever,

and is a Metre a bout. It is in a case, having a tablet with the following

indication :

              Metre

              Conforme a la loi du 18 Germinal an. III.

              Presentc le 4 Messidor an. YII.

And outside the inscription the words

              Fait par Lenoir.

That at the Conservatoire has precisely the same inscription, is in every way
identical with the other, and seems in a better state of preservation. The

KilogTcam of the Archives is a cyliader of platinum, without auy mark or

   The KUogram at the Conservatoire has been recently re-eonstrueted (1864),

and has the same form with the other.

Two distinct comparisons were made between these Metres and Kilograms,

and the result was that those at the Conservatoire Avere found to bo

1-00000329 and 1-00000072 respectively, as compared with those of the

Ai'chives. In answer to the assertion that a cubic centimetre of distQled

water at 4° Centigrade of temperature did not in fact furnish the exact basis

for the weight of the Kilogram, it was stated that the difference Avas quite

infinitesimal, and that it had no value whatever when the exact standard was

kept, and that corresponded with the standard Kilogram of all nations. The

statements of General Morin and M. Tresca were considered highly satis-

factory, as giving every guarantee of sufHcieut exactitude, and completely

Adispelled every doubt suggested on the subject.  Commission appointed

by the Committee afterwards inspected the Metre and Kilogram at the

Archives and Conservatoire, and having found them as described, made a

protocol signifying their satisfaction at tlie care with which the standards

were preserved, and at the results of the verification made.

"\^''ith reference to the iiniformity of weights and measures, your Com-

mittee have therefore much pleasure in reporting that their task has been

greatly accelerated by the Conference described, and that there is every pro-

spect that the principal nations will speedily adopt the Metric System. In

the United Kingdom much remains to bo done on the subject. As j'et the

Metric System, though rendered legal, has made but little progress either in

general practice or even in the education of the people, and your Committee

are of opinion that the most efficient mode for promoting the early introduc-

tion of this salutary reform is to make the use of the Metric System compul-

sory at no distant period. They recommend, therefore, amongst other mea-

sures, that a bill be speedily introduced in Parliament providing that after a

given time the use of metric weights and measures shall become compulsory

throughout the United Kingdom.

As regards the coinage, year Committee have to report the proceedings of

two important Conferences. The Monetary Convention signed at Paris

on the 23rd December 1865, by the representatives of France, Belgium,

Switzerland, and Italj', having established an agreement between four im-

portant countries whereby the coinage of each of them was made legally

current in all the others, great efforts have been made to induce other nations

to give their adhesion to the Convention. Hitherto the Convention was

made between nations Vt'hich had already an identical system of coinage. The

object of the Confereiice was to consider by what means those nations which

had a totally different system could be also united. This Conference, called

by the French Government, was hold at the Ministry of Foreign Aiiairs,

under the presidency of His Imperial Highness tb^e Prince Napoleon, and was

attended by representatives from Austria, Baden, Bavaria, Belgium, Denmark,

the United States, from Great Britain, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Por-

tugal, Prussia, Russia, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Turliey, and "NVurtem-

berg. The results of their deliberations were as follows.
-- ------ ---- --  --

472 REPORT--1867.

    It was mianimously agreed :
    That the monetary imification maj' more easily be realized by the mutual

         coordinatiou of the existing systems, taking into account the scientific

       advantages of certain types, and the number of persons who have already
       adopted them, than by the creation of a new system altogether inde-

        pendent of the existing ones.
    That for that purpose, the system agreed on by the Monetary Convention

       of 1865 should be taken principally into consideration, subject to any

      improvements of which it may be capable.

   It was agreed by all, except the representatives of the Netherlands,
    That it is not possible to attain such identity, or even a partial coinci-

        dence, in such monetary types in an extended area, on the basis and on
        condition of the exclusive adoption of a silver standard ; but that it is
        possible to attain it on the basis of a gold standard, allowing each State
        to preserve the silver standard in a transitory manner.
   It was agreed by all, except the representatives of Eussia and the United

States,

    That the advantage of internationality, which the coinage of the metal

       taken for common standard would possess, is not a sufficient guarantee

        for its being maintained in circulation in all the States, but that it is
        necessary to stipulate that in the countries which continue to use the
        silver standard only, and in those which have a double standard, the
       relation between the value of gold and silver should not be established
        on too low a footing, in order to give due facility for the practical intro-
         duction of the gold coinage.

    It was unanimously agreed,
   That for the success of the Monetary unification, it is necessary to fix types

      having a common denominator for the weight of the gold coin, with an

        identical fineness of 9/10 fine.

   The proposal that the common denominator should be the piece of five
francs was adopted by a majority of 13 votes against 2, the representatives
England and Sweden having voted against, and those of Prussia, Bavaria,

Baden, "Wurtemberg, and Belgium having abstained from voting.
   It was then uuanimouslj' agreed,

   That the gold coin of the common denominator of 5 francs should have
       legal course in all the States which are mutually bound l)j the Monetary

         Convention.

    It was agreed by all, except the representatives of Prussia, Baden, and
"VVurtemberg, who abstained from voting,

    That it would be iiseful that the types of coinage detei'mined by the
       Monetary Convention of 23rd December 1865, should be in the interest

       of unification, and consequently of reciprocity, completed by new types,

        for example, of 2-3 francs.
    But for the proposal that a piece of 15 francs be also added, the represen-
tatives of seven countries voted in favour, those of seven voted against, and
those of six, including Great Britain, abstained from voting.

    It was unanimously agreed
   That the Conference expresses the hope that the measures which may be

        adopted by the Governments of the different States in order to modify
        their respective monetary systems in accordance with the bases indi-

       cated by the Conference, should be made as much as possible the sub-

        jects of diplomatic conventions.

   And it was imanimouslj agreed
               --

;;

UNIFORMITY OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.  473

    That soon after the reception of the answers which may be given by the

        different States to the official communication, which will be made to
        them of the labours of the Conference by the Trench Government,
       that Government may, if necessary, call a new Conference.
    But on the question as to the' time when such answers should be given,
the representatives of ten countries voted for before the 1.5th February prox.,

 those of five voted in favour for the 1st October 1867, those of the United

States for the 1.5th May 1868, and those of Great Britain for the 1st June

1868. Those of France and Spain abstained.

    Such were the resolutions of the International Monetary Conference,
which had an official character, and whose proceedings were to a certain
extent binding on the States represented. The other Conference, whose

decisions on weights and measures we have already reported, vras also pre-
sided over by Prince J^Tapoleon, who took the chair on the day when the
monetary question was discussed.

    The Committee had not prepared a report on this subject, as in the case of
weights and measures, but had adopted the following resolutions, which were
submitted to the Conference, and adopted with only some verbal alterations.

    Whereas the adoption of a uniform system, of coinage would present evident
       advantages as regards convenience and economy in the settlement of
       international exchange, and recommends itself to the attention of all
        enlightened governments

    Whereas, on the other hand, sucli a desideratum cannot be realized unless
       several nations are prepared to saciiiicc their old and habitual instru-

      ments of traffic, whilst it is important that the change may be eifected
       in_ a gradual and continuous manner, and that the mode of effecting

       this clmnge should be as simple as possible and free from all incidental

         complication

   The Committee proposes as follows :

   l.It is necessary in the first instance that the different governments

       interested in this question should agree as to the same unit in the issue

        of their gold coins.

   2. It is desirable that this coin be everywhere coined of the same fineness,

of nine-tenths fine.

   3. It is desirable that each government should introduce, among its gold

        coins, one piece at least of a value equal to that of one of the pieces in

      use among the other governments interested, so that there may be among
      all the systems a point of common contact, from which each nation may

        afterwards advance in gradually assimilating its system of coinage to

      that w^hich may be chosen as a uniform basis.
   4. The series of gold coins now in use in France, being adopted by a great

       part of the population of Europe, is recommended as a basis of the uni-
       form system.

   5. Whereas, in consequence of accidental and happy circumstances, the

      most important monetary imits may be adapted to the piece of five francs
       in gold by means of very small changes, this piece seems the most con-

       venient to serve as a basis of a monetary system ; and the coins issued

      upon such a basis may become, as soon as the convenience of the nations

        interested permit, multiples of this unit.

   6. It is desirable that the different governments should decide that the
       coins issued by each nation in conformity with the uniform system pro-
       posed and agreed, should have legal currency in all other countries.

   7. It is desirable that the system of double standards be abandoned
--474<
REPORT 18G7.

        wherever it yet exists, that the system of decimal numeration be uni-

       versally adopted, and that the money of all nations be of the same fine-
       ness and the same form.
    8. It is desirable that the governments should come to an understanding
       for adopting common measiu'cs of control, so as to guarantee the inte-
       grity of the coinage both when issued and whilst in circulation.
   Your Committee will take these and other plans for the decimalization of
the coinage into their serious consideration, and as soon as possible will en-
deavour to propound one which they hope may meet all the requirements

of the question.

   In conclusion, your Committee are happy in reporting that in their action
they have obtained the valuable cooperation of the Coimeil of the Interna-
tional Decimal Association, and they trust that in the difficult and extensive
task they have before them they will obtain the active sympathy, and assis-
tance of the members of the British Association.

   The labours of the Conference will, wc trust, i^lacc the great and difficult
question of the decimalization of the coinage in the United Kingdom on a

satisfactory basis ; and it is time that it should be taken up in a practical and
busiuess-lilve manner.

   Tour Committee are perfectly agreed on the two great conditions that the
coinage should be international and decimal; but they have not yet come to
a satisfactory conclusion as to the imit which Avould best satisfy these deside-
rata. The pi'oposition of the Conferences to take the five-franc piece in
gold as a basis deserves consideration, though as a unit it would be imprac-

ticable, being too small as a gold coin, very easily lost, too costly to produce,

much subject to wear and tear, and not sufficiently large for transactions of
finance and commerce. The five francs could only be used as a submultiple,
and upon this two plans have been presented. One is to take the 10-franc

piece equivalent nearly to 100 pence ; another is to alter the sovereign to
the exact equivalent of 2.5 francs. The Committee will carefully consider
these and other jilans, with a view to tlie realization of an object so desirable
as an international coinage, and mILI report on the subject in due time.

    Report of the Committee on Standards of Electrical Resistance.

The Committee consists of Professor Williamson, Professor Sii' C. ^Ticat-

      stone. Professor Sir W. Thomson, Professor Miller, Dr. A. Matthiesseu,

       Mr. Fleeming Jenkin, Sir Charles Bi'ight, Professor Maxwell, Mr. C.

      W. Siemens, Mr. Balfour Stewart, Mi-. C. F. Yarley, Professor G. C.

       Foster, Mr. Latimer Clark, ]\Ir. D. Forbes, Mr. Charles Hockin, and
        Dr. Joule.

TnE Committee have much i^leasure in reporting that during the past year

considerable progress has been made, and that the principal instruments
required by the Committee for experiments have been completed and are

in use.

   The most important experiments have been those conducted by Dr. Joule,

liaving for their object the determination of the mechanical equivalent of
heat, by observing the heat generated in part of a voltaic circuit, the resist-
ance of which was measured in absolute units by means of the standard of
resistance issued by the Committee.
             ON STANDARDS OF ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE.  475

   Last year preliminary experiments of this kind had been made by Dr.
Joule, and the agreement which he then reported between his mechani-

cal equivalent obtained by frictional experiments and that obtained by the

electrical method was so close as to lead to a suspicion that it was partly

fortuitous.

The experiments, which have this year been conducted vrith every pos-

sible care, give 783 as the value derived from the B.A. standard of resist-
ance, while 772 is the well-known number derived from fi'iction.

   The details of the experiments are contained in an Appendix which accom-

panies this Report. Dr. Joule states his opinion that the electrical method

has been carried oiit with greater accuracy than the frictional method,

assuming the E.A. standard to be an exact decimal multiple of the absolute
unit. The following extract from Dr. Joule's Report T\'ill show the labo-

rious nature of the experiments. Ho says, " The last and most perfect series

of experiments comprise tliirty for the thermal effect of currents in the

spiral, thirty for the effect of radiation &c., and thirty for the horizontal

intensity pf the earth's magnetism." Di-. Joule expresses himself willing

to make a new determination by friction. Meanwhile the experiments
already completed remove aU fear of any serious error, cither in the number

hitherto used as " Joule's equivalent," or in the B.A. standard, a fear which
hitherto, remembering the very discrepant results obtained by others, has
been very naturally entertained even by the Sub-committee, from whose
experiments the standard was constructed.

   In connexion with the measurement of resistances, Mr. C. W. Siemens

has invented a simple and excellent contrivance, by which the measurement
of resistances can be made by persons wholly unaccustomed to electrical
experiments. They have only, after the necessary connexions arc made, to

turn a screw tUl a needle stands opposite a fiducial mark, when the resist-
ance required may be read directly on a scale with considerable accuracy.
Mr. Siemens proposes to apply this invention to pyrometers, where the

resistance read will indicate the temperature, and the only electrical con-

nexions required will be joining of the battery wires to two terminals.

Other applications of this invention wUl doubtless arise, and extend the

Apractical application of electrical measiirements.  full description of the

instrument is contained in the Appendix. Mr. Siemens reports very favour-

ably of this instrument, which possesses considerable advantage in cheap-

ness and portability. Mr. Siemens has constructed the instrument, and made

the experiments entirely at his own expense.

An instrument similar in object, and suggested by the above, is also

described by Sir. Jenkin in an Appendix.

Mr. Hockin has tested the constancy of the standard resistance-units, with

satisfactory results, except in the case of one mercury tube. The exact

results of Mr. Hoekin's comparisons are appended. He suggests that lead-
glass was used for the mercury tube, and that the glass may consequently

have been injured by the nitric acid used to clean it.
   Mr. Hockin lias also made interesting experiments on the construction of

large resistances by the use of selenium. He finds that resistances of one

million units and upwards can be made of this material, and that these

artificial resistances maintain a sensibly constant resistance at high tempera-
tures, such as 100° C. It is hoped that these very high artificial resistances

wiU be found useful in practice and much superior to those hitherto con-

structed of gutta pcrcha, or other insulators, which were of comparatively

little use in accurate work, owing to absorption, change of resistance with

temperature and inconstancy when kept for any considerable time. These

valuable experiments have not caused anj^ expense to the Association.
   The determination of a unit of capacity has occupied Dr. Matthiessen, Mr,

Hockin, Mr. Foster, and Mr. Jenkin during the last two years.
   Very considerable difficulties have been encountered, and are not yet wholly

overcome. The methods by which both the electrostatic and electromagnetic
units can be determined, and midtiples or submultiples prepared, arc suffi-
ciently simple in theoiy, but they assume that the condensers or Leyden
jars compared have really a definite capacity, and that with a given electro-
motive force, between the induction surfaces, a definite quantity of elec-
tricity will be contained in the jar or condenser. This is very far from true
with condensers of ordinary form. "Whether the dielectric separating the
plates be glass, mica, gutta percha, paraffin, ebonite, or any other known
solid insulator, an absorption of electricity takes place ; the longer the plates
are charged, the more electricity the condenser will contain, and conversely,
it win continue to discharge itself for a very long period after the inner and
outer armatures have been joined. AVith some of the best insulators the
effect will continue for hours, if not for days. Condensers made with these
solid dielectrics have therefore no definite measurable capacity. This capa-
city will differ according to the time during which they have been charged,

and it may also vary with extreme variation in the electromotive forces em-

ployed, although this latter change has not been detected wlien the differ-
ences of potential are such as between one Danicll's cell and two hundred.

   Only gaseous dielectrics appear free from this embarrassing peculiarity, called
absorption, polarization, or residual charge. One object of the Subcommit-
tee has therefore been to construct condensers in which air alone separated

the induction-j^latcs. But new difficulties arose in carrying this idea into
practice. kSome support for each i)late was neccssaiy, and then leakage

occurred from one plate to another over the surface of any small insulating
supports employed, such as glass balls or vulcanite stems. It was possible,
by great care in drying the air, occasionally to make condensers of this type,
Avhich would remain insulated for a short time, or even for some months
but long experience has shown that an artificially dried atmosphere cannot
be conveniently maintained in any instrument which is not hermetically

scaled.

    Dust also accumulated between the plates of the trial-condensers ; this
altered their capacity and increased the leakage from plate to plate. Even
a single filament of dust, by springing up and down between the two elec-
trified surfaces, would occasionally bring them to the same potentinl with
great rapidity, neutralizing the charge ; moreover a condenser of this type
could not be taken to pieces and cleaned, for no mechanical contrivances
could ensure that the parts after cleaning would return to their original
position so exactl}^ as to constitute a condenser of the same capacitj', before
and after the cleaning. It is therefore clear that an air-condenser can only
be constructed in a hermetically sealed case, containing an artificially dried
atmosphere ; and even with these conditions, excluding the graduated and
adjustible condensers, which were fii'st tried, the air-condenser is not easily
constructed. For large capacities, which arc alone useful in connexion
with practical telegraphy, the plates require to be so iiiimerous and large
as to make the expense great and the b\ilk very inconvenient.

    It is hoped by the use of tin plates, soldered to metal rods, and supported

on insulated stems inside a soldered metal case, that these objections may be
partly avoided ; but meanwhile practical men have introduced condensers of
         ON STANDARDS OF ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE.                  477

a more convenient form, overlooking the disadvantage which, they all possess

of ill-defined capacity.

   These condensers consist of sheets of tinfoil separated by paraffin and

--paper, a preparation of gutta percha, or mica three plans adopted by Mr.

Varley, Mr. Willoughby Smith, and Mr. Latimer Clark respectively.

   Condensers of this type have been made approximately equal to a knot
of some submarine cable, and the rough units thus introduced are gradually

creeping into use, although all electricians have been anxious that the Com-

mittee should issue a more scientific standard. Under these circumstances,
Mr. Jenkin has adjusted a mica-condenser, approximately equal to lO-i^

absolute electromagnetic units. The capacity of this condenser is assumed
as that which it possesses after electrification for one minute, and is mea-
sured by the discharge through a galvanometer, in the manner usually prac-
tised when testing the charge of a submarine cable. The formula for obtain-
ing the measurement in absolute units from the throw of the needle is very

simple, requiring only observations of the time of oscillation, of a resist-
ance in absolute measure, and of a deflection of the galvanometer-needle.

All of these observations can readily be made, so that their accumulated

error cannot exceed one per cent. ; and for the present purpose this accuracy

is sufficient, inasmuch as, when using the condenser, small variations

inevitably occur, arising from the residual discharge. While therefore the

new provisional unit of capacity has no claim to a high scientific accuracy, it
wiU supply a practical want and introduce a unit based on the principles

adopted by the Committee, in place of the random measures supplied by a
knot of Persian Gulf or Atlantic cable.

   No decision has yet been arrived at whether the new unit shall be issued
by the Committee, or on Mr. Jenkin's own responsibility, nor has the price

been fixed.

   The experiments by which it has been obtained are given in an Ap-

pendix,

   The practical applications of the standard of capacity are important. It

will allow the capacity of submarine cables to be universally expressed in

comparable figures, and may lead to improvement by the diminution of the

specific inductive capacity of the insulator, precisely as the introduction of

units of resistance has assisted the improvement in insulation and conduc-

tivity.

The electromagnetic capacity standard will also, by comparison with the

electrostatic standard about to be made, furnish one mode of determining

the constant called v in previous Eeports, a number of much importance in

the theory of electricity.

The next unit or standard for consideration is that of the difference of

potentials or electromotive force in absolute measure, concerning which tlie

experiments have been wholly in Sir William Thomson's hands. He reports

that he has at last succeeded in constructing a series of electrometers

-^capable of measuring differences of potential ranging from     of a DanieU's

cell up to 100,000 cells, and that these measurements can all be reduced to

absolute units by comparison with one instrument of the series.

   This class of instruments has been created by Sir William Thom-
son, who year by year has produced electrometers each surpassing its pre-

decessor, both in accuracy and delicacy ; but although those who have had

practical experience of the admirable results obtained by these, have for the
last two or three years believed that the limit of excellence has been reached.
Sir William Thomson has not ceased to invent better and simpler forms, until
                                                                                                       ;

478         -                                  REPORT--1867.

the instruments now supplied surpass every expectation of practical electri-

cians and furuisli, indeed, a ue^y engine for electrical research.
   The chief difPicultics encoimtered have heen the insulation of the Leyden

jar, -which has formed an essential part of all the contrivances, its main-
tenance at a constant potential, and the reduction to absolute measurement
in the present instrument absolutely perfect insulation is no longer required

for by a new device for converting mechanical force into statical electricity
(first constructed by Mr. Varley in 1859) Sir William Thomson is able at any
moment to replenish the jar by a few turns of a handle, and by a gauge

electrometer, he can insure that the same charge is constantly maintained
in the instrument. The difficulty of the reduction to absolute units consists
in the difficulty of comparing the extremely small forces produced by electro-
static attraction, with the force of gravitation, and in the accurate measure-
ment of the extremely smaU distances which separate the attracting surfaces.

Sir WilUam Thomson reports that these difficulties have been overcome in his
opinion, and that he wUl be shortly in a position to constmct and issue a

simple pattern of an absolute electrometer or gauge of potential which will

serve as a standard for general use.

Further experiments and tests are, however, required before this eau be

done, as any precipitation would only injure the interests of the Committee.

It is right here to mention that the above experiments have been carried

out almost entirely at tb.c expense of Sir WiUiam Thomson.

The repleuislier, which is founded on the principle of the electrophorus,

may vciy possibly supersede the old form of electrical machine entii'ely ; it

has some analogy with the electromagnetic machines lately invented by

Mr. C. W. Siemens and Professor Wheatstone, by which intense dynamic

effects are evolved from the smallest initial trace of magnetism, by the con-

version of mechanical force into electric currents, and was, indeed, sug-

gested by this invention to Sir "William Thomson, who reinvented the plan

patented by Mr. Yarley*.

  A modification of the same contrivance will allow the comparison of ex-

tremely minute quantities of electricity, such, indeed, as might be accumulated

on a pin's  head                         by a  series of rapid inductions  a  charge  is  accumulated  on
                                      ;

the electrode of an electrometer, which may be made equal in potential to

that on the pin's head, but infinitely exceeding it in quantity ; the effect of

this charge in the electrometer can then be ohserved without difficulty, and

any increase or diminution in the quantity of electricity on the pin's head

or proof plane can be detected, and the rate of loss or increase observed.

The potentials to which various small bodies arc charged can also be observed

l)y the same method, the advantage of which consists in the fact that the

original charge on the body tested is imdisturbed by the tost, whereas by

any of the older tests the charge was altered by being touched by a proof

plane or by the electrode of the electrometer.

  A similar plan has already been proposed by Mr. Yarley and Sir WUliam

Thomson, with a water-dropping arrangernent, but the mechanical contrivance

is in all ways preferable. No exjjonse has been inciu'red by the Committee for

these instruments or experiments.

Passing to the unit of current, the Committee regret that no experiments

have yet been made with the large absolute electrodynamometer constructed
with the funds granted by the Eoyal Society. Much difficulty has been

experienced in finding a sufficiently solid foundation in London, and probably

the instruments must be moved into the country for accurate use.

     A* similar plan was proposed by Mr. Nicbolson in 1785 : tide Phil. Trans.
ON STANDARDS OF ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE.                      479

  A portable electroclj-namometer has been constructed -which will be suit-

able for distribution as a standard instrument. It can be compared 'with the
large absolute instrument, and can also be compared directly with the most
sensitive astatic galvanometers yet made, as has been already proved by expe-
riment. These instruments cannot be distributed until further experiments
on their constancy have been made.

   Sir William Thomson, at his own expense, has also constructed an electro-
dynamometer for absolute measure. His results will check those obtained in
London, and the portable standard will also be tested by being sent backwards

and forwards between Glasgow and London, to be compared alternately with

the absolute instruments.

    The determination of " r," the ratio between the electrostatic and electro-
magnetic units, is also an object pursued by the Committee. Sir William
Thomson has made preliminary experiments, and has obtained numbers for
this constant by the aid of the absolute elcctrodynamometer, and the absolute
electrometer already named. The number he has obtained differs so consider-
ably from that hitherto received that he prefei's to extend his experiments
before publication. The same remark applies to the measurement of the
electromotive force of a Daniell's cell, made by the absolute electrometer.

    It is hoped that the present lleport contains satisfactory evidence that valu-

able work is being done by the Committee, and that the sums of money
KberaUy granted by the Association have been expended on proper objects.

    It will be seen that these grants have stimulated further expenditure on

the part of more than one member ; and thanks are also due to the Electric
and International Telegraph Company, for the liberality with which they
have lent large batteries, thereby sa'S'ing much expense. The Committee are
willing to be reappointed, and require no grant of money for the ensuing

year.

APPENDIX.

I. On a " Resistance-Measurer." Bij C. W. Siejtens, F.R.S.

For the measurement of small resistances the method formerly employed

was that of the tangent galvanometer, which method is still valuable in the

determination of resistances which are inseparable from a difference of electric

potential, such, for instance, as a galvanic element.

In measuring wire-resistance, more accurate and convenient methods have

been devised, amongst which that of the common differential galvanometer
and that known as Wheatstone's balance hold the most prominent places.

   But both these systems have disadvantages which render them insufficient
in a great many cases. For instance, in the first method a well-adjusted vari-

able-resistance-coil is necessary, which, if the method is intended to be appli-

cable between wide limits, wUl have impracticable large dimensions. The

bridge method, though very beautiful, requu-es three adjusted coils, and fre-

quently gives rise to calculations, which renders it unavailable for unskilled

operators. The sine method, which is the most siutable for measuring great

resistances, requires even a superior amount of skill and mathematical know-

ledge on the part of the operator.

Many years' experience of these methods made me feel the want of an in-

strument which would, by its simplicity of construction and case of manipula-

tion, be capable of employment by an unskilled operator with a degree of

exactness equal to that of the bridge method.          ,
              ----

--480 REPORT 1867.

   The condition ii^Don which such an instrument could bo successful appeared

to be the following :

   1. The employment of a zero method, by which the galvanometer-needle
should always be brought to the direction of the magnetic meridian, or the
same given point upon the scale, and therefore bo independent of the unknown

function of the angle of deflection.

   2. The readings to be made upon a simple lineal measure divided into equal

parts signifying equal units of resistance.

   3. The emplo3-ment of a single and unalterable comparison-resistance.
   The apparatus constructed to fulfil these conditions is represented by the
following diagram :

   Two equal and parallel helices, h and h' , are fixed upon the common

slide s s , which moves in the direction of its length between guide rollers.
This motion is effected by the end s armed by a facing of agate, which
presses against the face of the metal curve c c'. The latter is fixed upon a
slide moving in a groove in the rule d d' , at right angles in the direction d d' by
means of a milled head /, on the axis of which is a pinion gearing into a rack
underneath the straight edge of the curve c c. The rule d d' is graduated in
equal parts ; and opposite to the divisions is a nonius up the straight edge and
the curve, to divide each degree into ten parts. Whenever the milled head
i', therefore, is turned, the position of the curve is altered ; and as the point s'
of the bobbin- slide is pressed against it by means of a spring, the bobbin fol-
lows it in all its movements.

   The wires of the two bobbins are connected together, in the common point

a, with the pole of a galvanic battery e, the other pole being connected with
two resistances E, and through these with the remaining end of the galvano-

Emeter-helices. The resistance is made constant, and adjusted so that when

_^,_0 the index of the curve stands exactly opposite the zero of the graduated

scale d d, the unknown resistance being represented by .r.

    It is evident that, the resistance in the bobbins being equal, as also their
dimensions and initinl magnetic efi^ects upon the needle suspended between

them, if we make the resistance x equal to E, the current in the two branches
       --;

       ON STANDARDS OF ELECTEICAL RESISTANCE.      481

will be equal, and the magnet-neecUe therefore balanced between them only
when the heUces are eqiially distant from it. Should, however, either of these

resistances preponderate, the strength of current in that branch will be les-
sened ; and in order to reestablish the balance it will be necessary to shift the
bobbins, approaching the one in which the weaker current is cii'culating towards
the suspended magnet.

    The instrument is erected upon a horizontal metal table standing upon
three levelling-screws. The bobbin, the suspended magnet, and dial plate for
observing the zero of the pointer are contained in a glass case, supported by
four brass pillars. The instrument is supplied with terminals for the battery-
connexions, and a current -breaker for interrupting the battery- circuit. Oppo-

site to these are four terminal screws for receiving the ends of the resistances
11 and .V, with contact-plugs between them, in order to quickly establish a
short circuit in case the operator should be in doubt towards which side he

has to move the adjusting-curve. Two constant resistances accompany the

--apparatus E, that which is used during the measurement, and a, a resistance

of known value, which is introduced between the terminals .v in order to
enable the operator for his own security to make a control measurement by
which he may verify the accuracy of the instrument at any time. Another

pui'pose of this resistance is to facilitate the readjustment of the zero-point, in

case the galvanometer should at any time be cleaned or a new silk-fibre put in.

    In constructing the sliding ciu've of this instrument, it might be determined

by calculation from the formula given by Weber for the deflection produced by
a circular current of known magnitude upon a magnetic point, and from the

given distance of the coils from each other. I prefer, however, in practice to
determine the curve of each separate apparatus empirically, because it is not

possible to coil a helix mathematically true, or to set it, when coiled absolutely

at right angles to the plane of its horizontal motion.
    In the determination of each curve I use a deHcately adjusted rheostat or

scale of resistances in the circuit of x, giving it varying valiies corresponding
to the equal divisions of the engraved scale, and constructing the curve accord-
ing to the position which it is found necessary to give to the point s' in order

--to arrive at the magnetic balance. "With each instrument it would be possible

to have two values of E. one expressed in mercury and the other in B. A. units
and in order to measure at pleasure in either of these units, it would only be
necessary to insert the one or other between the terminal screws for R.

   The instrument has been found to be very convenient for the measirrement

of the wire -resistances of overland lines, or for the reading of resistance ther-
mometers ; it reduces the operation and the observation of the zero position of

a needle, and the reading upon a graduated scale, which can be performed by
a person of ordinary intelUgence without experience in electrical measurement.
In accuracy and range it equals the bridge method, while as regards portability
and cheapness of apparatus the advantages are decidedly in its favour*.

   The following method of measuring resistances was suggested to Mr. Jenkin
by the above invention of Mr. Siemens :

* I have lately constructed the same instrmnent on this principle with a circular instead

of a straight sliding-pieee, which gives the advantage of a longer graduated scale in tho

form of a circle. The circular sliding curve is adjusted by radial set screws in a solid ring

working in a V-groove round the galvanometer.

a long light index pointing at a fiducial mark when the needle is in the
magnetic meridian. Let the battery and coils be so joined that the current
shall divide in the ratio of the resistances in the two coUs, and shall pass in

such a direction as to tend to turn the needle in opposite directions.

 to the following experiments. Tlie capacity of any condenser can be directly
 measured in absolute measure by the following formula applying to the effect
 of a single discharge from the condenser through a galvanometer :

                                                 g__o^ sin|i

 (vide Eeport, 1863, Appendix C, p. 144), where R^ is the resistance of a
 circuit in which the electromotive force used to charge the condenser would

 produce the unit deflection, whUe i is the angle to which the needle is ob-

 served to swing from a position of rest, and is half the period or time of a
 complete oscillation of the needle of the galvanometer under the influence of
 terrestrial magnetism alone.

    This formula, which is analogous to that for any ballistic pendulum acted
 upon by a known impulse, supposes that the whole impulse is given in a time
 very short as compared with t, and it also supposes that the deflection i is
 unimpeded by friction.

     I employed a Thomson's astatic reflecting galvanometer with double coils
 of German-silver wire. The oscillations, with the usual mirror and magnet,
 subside so rapidly that t cannot be measured with accuracy, and i is very
 sensibly affected by the resistance of the aii" ; to obviate this I attached a
 brass ball to the lower magnet of the galvanometer, weighing 55 grains*.

   A single floss-silk fibi'e can just support this weight, under which it con-

 tinues to stretch sensibly for about three days. In order tliat the discharge

from the condenser, electrified by from 20 to 30 cells, should have force to move
this heavy ball through a sensible angle, the galvanometer was made highly
 astatic, and then I found that with even a single cocoon fibre the needle did
not return to zero within three or four divisions of the scale for some
minutes, exhibiting a kind of viscosity. The floss-silk fibre, though much
weaker, gave a very constant zero. The value of t with the weighted
needle seldom differed much from 20 seconds, and the times could be observed
for 10 or 11 minutes, during which time t was found to remain sensibly
constant. As there was no difiiculty in observing the tiuaes of oscillation
within one second, it may be said that the observed value of t was correct
within one part in 500. Greater accuracy was not required, as the possible
error from other sources considerably exceeds this. Twenty Daniell's cells
were used to charge the condenser, and the discharge observed was about
180 divisions ; but the observations were recorded within a quarter of a
division : as this is done by estimating the position of the reflected sjjot
stationary between the two black lines of the scale for an almost insensible
time, it would not be right to assume that the deflection i is observed with

greater accuracy than one part in 400. When the spot of light returned

after making one complete oscillation, the diminution in the deflection was
from 10 to 12 divisions ; one quarter of this amount was therefore added as
correction in each case to the deflection observed. The resistance of the
whole circuit was composed of the batteiy resistance, that of German-silver
resistance-coUs, and of the German-silver coils in the galvanometer ; no
considerable variation could therefore occur except in the battery, which
formed only a small portion of the total resistance. The coils (adjusted by
Mr. Hockin) are probably correct within one part in a thousand, and the
measurement of the galvanometer-coils is equally well known.

   From what has been said, it might be expected that the capacity of any

condenser could be obtained with an accuracy of one part in 400 or 500 at

   * The ball, two mngnets, mirror, and connecting bar, forming the whole suspended
system, weighed STj gr;iins.

least ; but successive discharges were occasionally found to differ by as much
as two divisions, though this amount of discrepancy was rare. It was due

partly to the residual effect of former charges in the condenser, though gieat

care was taken to avoid this, partly, it is believed, to slight changes in the

electromotive force of the battery (which was not in very good order, the

discharges being generally less toward the end of a set of experiments), and

partly to sHght motion of the needle at the moment of taking the discharge.

This last source of error made it impossible to make the observations in Lou-

don ; even in the country the needle was seldom, if ever, absolutely stUl,
though the oscillations were generally less than one division. The variation

of the electromotive force and resistance of the battery when taking a per-

manent deflection was another source of error. Owing to the great inertia

of the swinging parts, no observation could be taken until the cm-rent had

been flowing for at least a minute, and often more ; and, especially when small
resistances were used, the deflections visibly diminished with time. Owing to

all these causes, I do not depend on the results obtained as certainlj- accurate

within less than one per cent. This is the less to be regretted, as the capacity

of a mica condenser is very ill defined within wide limits, owing to absorption.

The condenser used consisted of 38 plates of mica, about 0-003 in. thick, and

having a circular piece of tinfoil 3 in. in diameter cemented to each side of the

mica, -ndth a piece of each tinfoil projecting beyond the mica so as to join all

the upper tinfoils and all the lower tinfoils together, and form the inner and

outer armature of the condensers. This plan has for some time been practised

by Mr. Latimer Clark, and makes a very constant and well-insulated condenser,

extremely easy to adjust roughly by altering the number of the mica plates, and

for small corrections by cutting away portions of the tinfoil from the top plate.
Mica, like all other solid dielectrics with which I am acquainted, apparently

absorbs electricity to a A"ery large extent, and continues to do so for a long-

time, discharging it at first rapidly, but at the last very slowly indeed, so that

a complete discharge is not effected for hours. The total capacity of the con-

denser varies therefore as the time varies during which it is charged, and the

apparent discharge varies with the time during which we measure it; for

instance, if we merely observe the discharge due to a momentary contact,

"we shall obtain a different result from that given when we maintain the

contact all the time the needle is swinging ; the result will also vary in the

latter case with the time of oscillation of the galvanometer needle. If the

needle oscillates slowly, it -will be acted upon by a greater qiiantity of elec-

tricity than if oscillating rapidly. Thus, in one experiment, the deflection,

when the discharging contact was permanently maintained, was 1C6 divisions,
when a momentary contact Avas made by a blow it was only 156°. AVhen

the contact was made for about 1-7 second the deflection was 161, and when

the contact was maintained for 3*4 seconds the deflection was 164 ; the

maximum deflection of 166 was reached after 5 seconds : these experiments
show that when the needle had travelled two-thirds of its maximum

distance, the current being- discharged exercised a very sensible influence on

the deflection. The ballistic formula is therefore not strictly applicable to a

case of this kind, and a different result would be obtained with a galvano-

meter oscillating either more or less quickly than the one I used. It seemed

therefore unnecessary to take great precautions or to aim at any high degree

myof acciu-acy ; and  object has simply been to provide a unit for cable-testing

which shall be approximately equal to the ideal standard chosen by the Com-

mittee, and wliich can be used with at least as great accuracy as those copies

of knots of Atlantic or Persian Gulf cables hitherto used.

--486 REPORT 1867.

   The value of R^, in the formula given at the commencement, was found
by two methods, Avhich we will call the indirect and direct method. In
the indirect method three sets of resistauce-coil?, a, h, c, were arranged
as in fig. 1, with a battery B, and a galvanometer G, and a shunt Z, equal

                                       Fig. 1.        Eig. 2.

in resistance to ^^tj- of the galvanometer-coils. The resistance c was made

equal to 1000 units, aud the resistances a and b adjusted until a convenient

deflection was obtained on the galvanometer ; the resistance a was next

changed to  aud b was then altered to b so as to give the same deflection
                                                  J,

Gas before on the galvanometer G. Then calling d the deflection observed,

the resistance of the galvanometer, we have

                                       --I
                                                {b bjc             )

a formula for which the resistance of the battery need not be calculated

   The second or direct method of obtaining E,j was first to calculate the resis-

tance of the batteiy B by the following formula (fig. 2) : h and/ are vaiiable
resistances; r/ the resistance of the shunted galvanometer =47 '2 in my ex-

periments ; break the circuit at /, and adjust h till a convenient reading
is obtained ; then join /, as shown in the sketch, and adjust/ and h untU the
same deflection is obtained as before ; then, calling h^ the last resistance at h,

we have

                                       B=/ 7i-h,
                                            0+K

Secondly, a direct deflection d was obtained witli a resistance Jc in cir

= + +Bcuit; then Ilj H(? (I-           r/).

others, we find the average to be 0-99G2 X 10 "1*^ and the approximation be-

tween this mean and any single results is 0-42 per cent. It is therefore

probable that a unit copied from this preliminary standard will not be one

per cent, wrong.

  A tenfold multiple (10"" absolute measure) of the condenser measured is

a convenient magnitude as a practical xmii of capacity for telegraphy ; thus

the capacity of the Atlantic cable per knot thus measured is 0-3535. Assum-

ing that the practical unit of electromotive force will be chosen as that mul-

tiple which is most nearly equal to Daniell's cell, i. e. 10" electromagnetic

iinits, then the capacity of the proposed practical iinit is such that it contains

Mwith the imit E F the same quantity of electricity as would be passed

in one second through a circuit of the resistance of one Megohm. Thus

solute capacity equal to lO"^"' with 10--^ absolute units of quantity. This

practical series of units is that which, in the opinion of Mr. Latimer Clark

and myself, is best adapted for practical use in telegraphy. Mr. Clark caUs

the unit of quantity thus defined (10~^) one Earad, and similarly says that

the unit of capacity has a capacity of one Earad, it being rinderstood that this

is the capacity when charged with unit electromotive force (10^).

              V. Report on Electrometers and Electrostatic Measurements.

                              By Sir Wm. Thomson, F.B.S.

   § 1. An electrometer is an instrument for measuring differences of electric

potential between two conductors through effects of electrostatic force, and is
distinguished from the galvanometer, which, of whatever species, measures
differences of electric potentials through electromagnetic effects of electric
currents produced by them. ^V^len an electrometer merely indicates the
existence of electric potential, without measuring its amount,* it is commonly

called an electroscope ; but the name electrometer is properly applied when

greater or less degrees of difference are indicated on any scale of reckoning,
if approximately constant, even during a single series of experiments. The
first step towards accurate electrometry in every case is to deduce from
the scale-readings numbers which shall be in simple proportion to the dif-
ference of potentials to be determined. The nest and last step is to assign

the corresponding values in absolute electrostatic measure. Thus, when for

any electrometer the first step has been taken, it remains only to determine
the single constant coefficient by which the numbers deduced from its indica-
tions as simply jiroportional to differences of potential must be multij)lied to
give differences of potential in absolute electrostatic measure. This coefficient
will bo called, for brevity, the absolute coefficient of the instrument in question.

    § 2. Thus, for example, the gold-leaf electrometer indicates differences of
potential between the gold leaves and the solid walls enclosing the air-space
in which they move. If this solid be of other than sufficiently perfect con-

ducting material, of wood and glass, or of metal and glass, for instance, as in
the instriiment ordinarily made, it is quite imperfect and indefinite in its

indications, and is not worthy of being even called an electroscope, as it may
exhibit a divergence when the difference of potentials which the operator

desires to discover is absolutely zero. It is interesting to remark that
Faraday first remedied this defect by coating the interior of the glass case
with tinfoil cut away to leave apertures proper and sufficient to allow indi-
cations to be seen, but not enough to cause these indications to differ sensibly
from what they would be if the conducting envelope were completely closed
around it ; and that not till a long time after did any other naturalist, mathe-
matician, or instrument-maker seem to have noticed the defect, or even to have
unconsciously remedied it.

   § 3. Electrometers may be classified in genera and species according to the

shape and kinematic relations of their parts ; birt as in plants and animals a
perfect continuity of intermediate species has been imagined between the

rudimentary plant and the most perfect animal, so in electrometers we may

actually construct species having intermediate qualities continuous between
the most widely different genera. But, notwithstanding, some such classifi-
cation as the following is convenient with reference to the several instruments

commonly in use and now to be described :

        Transactions).

II. Symmetrical electrometers.

Bohuenberger's electrometer.

III. Attracted disk electrometers.

Spring-standard electrometer.

    § 4. Class I. is sufficiently illustrated by the examples referred to ; and it
is not necessary to exjjlain any of these instruments minutely at present, as
they are, for the present at all events, superseded by the di^dded-ring elec-
trometer and electrometers of the third class.

   There are at present only two known species of the second class ; but it is

intended to include all electrometers in which a symmetrical field of electric
force is constituted by two symmetrical fixed conductors at different electric
potentials, and in which the indication of the force is produced by means of
an electrified body moveable symmetrically in either direction from a middle

position in this field. This definition is obviously fulfilled by Eohnenberger's

well-known instrument*.

My§ 5.  first published description of a divided- ring electrometer is to be

found in the Memoirs of the Eomau Academy of Sciences f about 1856 ; but

--since that time I have made great improvements in the instrument first, by

applying a light mirror to indicate deflections of the moving body ; next, by

substituting for two half rings four quadrants, and consequently for an

electrified body projecting on one side only of the axis, an electrified body

projecting symmetrically on the two sides, and moveable round an axis ; and

lastly, by various mechanical improvements and by the addition of a simple

gauge to test the electrification of the moveable body, and a replenisher to
raise this electrification to any desired degree.

    § 6. In the accompanying drawings, Plate V. fig. 1 represents the front
elevation of the instrument, of which the chief bulk consists of a jar of white

glass (flint) supported on three legs by a brass mounting, cemented round the

outside of its mouth, which is closed by a flat cover of stout sheet-brass, and

a lantern-shaped cover standing over a wide aperture in its centre. For
brevity, in what foUows these three parts will be called the jar, the main
cover, and the lantern.

    Pig. 5 represents the quadrants as seen from above ; they are seen in ele-
vation at a and h, fig. 1, and in section at c and d, fig. 2. They consist of four

quarters of a flat circular box of brass, with circular apertures in the centres
of its top and bottom. Their position in the iustnimeut is shown in figs.

&1, 2, 6. Each of the four quadrants is supported on a glass stem passing

downwards through a slot in the main cover of the jar, from a brass mount-
ing on the outside of it, and admits of being drawn outwards for a space
of about f of an inch (1 centim.) from the positions they occupj^ when the
instrument is in use, which are approximately those shown in the drawings.
Three of them are secured in their proper positions by nuts (c, e, e) on the out-
side of the chief flat lid of the jar shown in fig. 4. The upper end of the stem,

carrying the fourth, is attached to a brass piece (/) resting on three short legs

on the upper side of the maiu cover, t'^o of these legs being guided by a

straight V-groore at g to give them freedom to move in a straight line in-
wards or outwards, and to prevent any other motion. This brass piece is

pressed outwards and downwards by a properly arranged spring (Ji), and is
kept from sliding out by a micrometer-screw ((') txirning in a fixed nut. This

simple kinematic arrangement gives great steadiness to the fourth quadrant

when the screw is turaed inwards or outwards, and then left in any position

and at the same time produces but little friction against the sliding in either

direction. The opposite quadrants are connected in two pairs by wires, as

shown in fig. 5 ; and two stout vertical wires (I, m), called the chief electrodes
passing through holes in the roof of the lantern, are firmly supported by long

perforated vulcanite columns passing through those holes which serve to

connect the pairs of quadrants with the external conductors whose diiference

of potentials is to be tested. Springs («, o) at the lower ends of these columns,

shown in figs. 1 & 2, maintain metallic contact between the chief electrodes
and the upper sides of two contiguous quadrants (a & 5) when the lantern is set

down in its proper position, but allow the lantern to be removed, carrpng the

chief electrodes with it, and to be replaced at pleasure without disturbing the

quadrants. The lantern also carries an msidated charging-rod (p), or tem-

porary electrode, for charging the inner coating of the jar (§ 11) to a small

degree, to be increased by the replenisher (§ 12), or, it may be, for making

special experiments in which the potential of the interior coating of the jar

is to be measured by a separate electrometer, or kept at any stated amount

from that of the outer coating. When not in use this temporarj'' electrode is

secured in a position in which it is disconnected from the inner coating.

   § 7. The main cover supports a glass column (q, fig. 2) projecting vertically
upwards through its central apertm-e, to the iipper end of which is attached a

brass piece (/·), which bears above it a fixed atti-actiug disk (s), to be described

later (§ 13) ; and projecting down from it a fixed plate bearing the silk-fibre
suspension of the mirror (t), needle (u), &c., seen in figs. 1 & 2, and fixed guard

tubes (v, lu), to be described presently.

§ 8. The moveable conductor of the instrument consists of a stiff platinum

wire (x), about 8 centimetres (3^ inches) long, with the needle rigidly attached

in a perpendicular plane to it, and connected with sulphuric acid in the

bottom of the jar by a fine platinum wire hung down from its lower end and

kept stretched by a platinum weight under the level of the liquid. The

upper end of the stiff platinum wire is supported by a single silk-fibre so that
it hangs down vertically. The mirror is attached to it just below its upper
end. Thus the miiTor, the needle, and the stiff platinum stem constitute a
rigid body having very perfect freedom to move round a vertical axis (the

line of the bearing fibre), and yet practically prevented from any other

motion in the regular use of the instrument by the weight of its own mass

and that of the loose piece of platinum hanging from it below the surface of

Athe hquid in the jar.  very small magnet is attached to the needle, which,

by strong magnets fixed outside the jar, is directed to one position, about

which it oscillates after it is turned through any angle round the vertical

axis, and then left to itself. The external magnets are so placed that Avhen

there is magnetic equilibrium the needle is in the symmetrical position shown

&in figs. 5 6 with reference to the quadrants *.

§ 9. The needle (u) is of very thin sheet aluminium cut to the shape seen in

&figs. 5  6;  the very thinnest sheet  aluminium that gives the requisite stiflf-

ness being choseu. If thS' four quadrants are in a perfectly symmetrical

position round it, and if they are kept at one electric potential by a metallic

arc connecting the cliief electrodes outside, the needle may be strongly

electrified without being disturbed from its position of magnetic equilibrium

but if it is electrified, and if the external electrodes be disconnected, and any

diflference of potentials established between them, the needle will clearly ex-

perience a couple tru'ning it round its vertical axis, its two ends being driven

from the positive quadrants towards the negative, if it is itself positively

electrified. It is kept positive rather than negative in the ordinary use of

the instrument, because I find that when a conductor with sharp edges or

points is surrounded by another presenting everywhere a smooth surface, a

much greater difference of potentials can be established between them, with-

out producing disruptive discharge, if the points and edges are positive than

if they are negative.

§ 10. The mirror (t) servos to indicate, bj^ reflecting a ray of light from a

lamp, small angular motions of the needle round the vertical axis. It is a veiy

Qlight, concave, silvered glass mirror, being of only 8 millimetres of an inch)

diameter, and 22 milligrammes ( j grain) weight. I had for many years ex-

myperienced great difficulty in getting suitable mirrors for  form of mirror

galvanometer; but they are now supplied in very great perfection by Mr.

Becker, of Messrs. EUiott Brothers, London. The focus for parallel rays is

about 50 centimetres (20 inches) from the mirror, and thus the rays of the

lamp placed at a distance of 1 metre (or 40 inches) are brought to a focus at

the same distance. The lamp is usually placed close behind the vertical

screen a little below or above the normal line of the mirror, and the image

is thrown on a graduated scale extending horizontally above or below the

apertui'e ta the screen through which the lamp sends its light. When the

miiTor is at its magnetic zero position the lamp is so placed that its image is,

as nearly as may be, in a vertical plane with itself, and not more than an

inch above or below its level, so that there is as little obliquity as possible

in the reflection, and the line traversed by the image on the screen during the

deflection is, as nearly as may be, straight. The distance of the lamp and

screen from the mirror is adjusted so as to give as perfect an image as possi-

ble of a fme wire which is stretched vertically in the plane of the screen

across the aperture through which the lamp shines on the mirror ; and with

Mr. Becker's miiTors I find it easy to read the horizontal motions of the dark

image to an accuracy of the tenth of a millimetre. In the ordinary use of

the instrument a white paper screen, printed from a copper-plate, is employed,

and the readings are commonly taken to aboiit a quarter of a scale-division
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

but with a little practice they may, when so much accuracy is desired, be

read with considerable accuracy to the tenth of a scale-division. Formerly

a slit in front of the lamp was used, biit the v^'ire giving a dark line in tho

middle of the image of the flame is a veiy great improvement, first intro-
duced by Dr. Everett in consequence of a suggestion made by Professor P. G.
Tait, in his experiments on the elasticity of solids made in the Natural-

Philosophy Laboratory of Glasgow University*.

jar, the outside of the jar being coated with tinfoil and connected with the

earth, so that it is in reality a Leyden jar. The whole outside of the jar,

even where not coated with tinfoil, is in the ordinary use of the instrument,

especially in our moist climate, kept virtually at one potential through con-

duction along its surface. This potential is generally, by connecting wires

or metal pieces, kept the same as that of the brass legs and framework of

the instrument. To prevent disturbance in case of strongly electrified bodies

being brought into the neighbourhood of the instrument, a wire is eitlier
wrapped round the jar from top to bottom, or a cage or network of wire, or any

convenient metal case, is placed round it ; but this ought to be easily removed

or opened at any time to admit of the interior being seen. When the instru-

ment is left to itself from day to day in ordinary use, the needle, connected

with the inner coating of the jar as just described, loses, of course, imless

replenished, something of its charge ; but not in general more than | per

cent, per day, when the jar is of flint glass made in Glasgow. On trying

similar jars of green glass I found that they lost their charge more rapidly

per hour than the white glass jars per month. I have occasionally, but very

rarely, found white glass jars to be as defective as those green ones, and it is

possible that the defect I found in the green jars was an accident to the jars

tested, and not an essential property of that kind of glass.

§ 12. I have recently made the very useful addition of a replenisher to

restore electricity to the jar from time to time when required. It consists of

(1) a turning vertical shaft of vulcanite bearing two metal pieces called carriers

&&(b, b, figs. 17 18) ; (2) two springs {d, d, figs. 16 IS, Plate V.), connected

by a metaUic arc, making contact on the carriers once every half turn of the
shaft, and therefore called connectors ; and (3) two inductors (a, a) with re-

ceiving springs (c, c) attached to them, which make contact on the carriers

once every half turn, shortly before the connecting contacts are made. The

inductors {a a, figs. IG & IS) are pieces of sheet metal bent into circular cylin-

drical shapes of about 120° each ; they are placed so as to deviate in the man-
ner shown in the di-awing from parts of a cylindrical surface coaxal with the

turning-shaft, leaving gaps of about G0° on each side. The diameter of this

cylindrical surface is about 15 millimetres (about | an inch). The carriers

(6 b, figs. 17 ife IS) are also of sheet metal bent to cylindrical surfaces, but not
exactly circular cylinders ; and are so placed on the bearing vulcanite shaft

that each is rubbed by the contact springs over a very short space, about 1
millimetre beyond its foremost edge, when turned in the proper direction for

replenishing. The receiving springs (c, c, figs. 17 & IS) make their contacts

with each carrier immediately after it has got fairly under cover, as it were,
of the inductor. Each carrier subtends an angle of about 60° at the axis
of the turning-shaft. The connecting contacts are completed just before the
carriers commence emerging from being under cover of the inductors. The

carriers may be said to be under cover of the inductors when they are within
an angle of 120° on each side of the axis subtended by the inductors. One

of the inductors is in metallic communication with the outside coating of the

&jar, the other with the inside. Figs. 16, 17,  18 illustrate sufficiently

the shape of carriers and the succession of the contacts. The arrow-head

Anish the charge, the replenisher is tiu'ned backwards.  small charge having

been given to the jar from an independent source, the replenisher when

--down the air-insulation by disruptive discharge. The electric action is

explained simply thus : The carriers, when connected by the connecting

springs, receive opposite charges by induction, of which they deposit large

proportions the next time they touch receiving springs. Thus, for example,

if the jar be charged positively, the carrier emerging from the inductor

connected with the inner coating carries a negative charge round to the

receiving spring connected with the outside coating, while the other carrier,

emerging from the inductor connected with the outside coating, carries

a positive charge round to the receiving spring connected with the inside

coating. If the carriers are not suiRcieutlj^ well under cover of the inductors

during both the receiving contacts and the connectiiig contacts to render the

charges which they acquire by induction during the connecting contacts

greater than that which they carry away with them from the receiving con-

tacts, the rotation, even in the proper dii'ection for replenishing, does not

increase, biit, on the contrarj', diminishes the charge of the jar. The de-

viations of the inductors from the circular cylinder referred to above have

Abeen adopted to give greater security against this failure.  steel pivot

fixed to the top of the vulcanite shaft, and passing through the main cover,

carries a small milled head {y, fig. 1) above, on the outside, which is spun

rapidly round in either direction by pressing the finger on it, and thus in

less than a minute a small charge in the jar may be doubled. The dimi-

nution of the charge, when the instrument is left to itself for twenty-four

hours, is sometimes imperceptible ; but when any loss is discovered to have

taken place, even if to the extent of lU per cent., a few moments use of the

replenisher suiRces to restore it, and to adjust it with minute accuracy to the

required degree by aid of the guage to bo described presently. The ininciple
of the " replenisher " is identical with that of the " donbler " of Bennet. In

the essentials of its construction it is the same as Yarley's improved form of

Nicholson's " revolving doubler."

§ 13. The gauge consists of an electrometer of Class III. The moveable

attracted dislc is a square portion of a piece of very thin sheet aluminium of

the shape showii at x in fig. 4. It is supported on a stretched platinum wire

passing through two holes in the sheet, and over a very small projecting

ridge of bent sheet aluminium placed in the manner shown in the magnified

di'awing, fig. 3. The cuds of this wire are passed through holes in curved

springs, shown in fig. 4, and are bent round them so as to give a secure

attachment without solder, and without touching the straight stretched part

of the wii'e. The ends of the platinum wire (p, /3) are attached by cement to
the springs, merely to prevent them from becoming loose, care being taken

that the cement does not prevent metallic contact between some part of the

aluminium wire and one or both of the brass springs. I have constantly

found fine platinum wire rendered brittle by ordinary solder apphed to

it. The use of these springs is to keep the platinum wire stretched with

an approximately constant tension, from year to year and at various tempera-

tures. Their fixed ends are attached to round pins, which are held with their

axes in a line Avith the fibre by friction, in bearings forming parts of two ad-

justable brass pieces (y, y) indicated in fig. 4 ; these pieces are adjusted once
for all to stretch the wire with sufficient force, and to keep the square attracted

disk in its proper position. The round pins bearing the stretching springs are

turned through very small angles by pressing on the projecting springs with

the finger. They are set so as to give a proper amount of torsion tending to

tilt the attracted disk (a) upwards, and the long end of the aluminium lever (o),

of which it forms a part, downwards. The downward motion of the long end

is limited by a properly placed stop. Another stop (e) above limits the upward

motion, which takes place imder the influence of elcctiification in the use of

the instrument. A. very fine opako black haii' (that of a small black-and-tan

terrier I have found much superior to any hitherto tried) is stretched across
the forked portion of the sheet aluminium in which the long arm of the lever

terminates. Looked at horizontally from the outside of the instrument it is

seen, as shown in fig. 7, Plate V., against a white background, marked with two
very fine black circles. These sight-plates in the instruments, as now made by

Mr. White, are of the same material as the ordinary enamel watch-dials, mth

black figiu'es on a white groimd. The white space between the two circles

should be a very Httle less than the breadth of the hair. The sight-plate is

set to be as near the hair as it can be without imjieding its motion in any

part of its range ; and it is slightly convex forwards, and is so placed that

the hair is nearer to it when in the middle between the black circles than
when in any other part of its range. It is thus made veiy easy, even with-

out optical aid, to avoid any considerable error of parallax in estimating the

position of the hair relatively to the two black circles. By a simple plano-

convex lens (f, fig. 2), with the convex side turned inwards, it is easy, in

the ordinary use of the instrument, to distinguish a motion up or down of
the hair amounting to g-^,; of an inch. With a little care I have ascertained,

Dr. Joule assisting, that a motion of no more than g^^^ of an inch from one
definite central position can be securely tested without the aid of other
magnifying-power than that given by the simple lens. The lens during use
is in a fixed position relatively to the framework bearing the needle, but it

may be drawn out or pushed in to suit the focus of each observer. To give

great magnification, it ought to be drawn out so far that the hair and sight-

plate behind may be but little nearer to the lens than its principal focus,

and the observer's eye ought to be at a very considerable distance from the
instrument, no less than 20 centimetres (8 inches) to get good magnification
and a short-sighted person shoidd use his ordinary concave eye-lens close to

Ms eye. The reason for turning the convexity of the small plano-convex lens

inwards is, that if the eye of the observer is too high or too low, the hair

seems to him curved upwards or downwards, and he is thus guided to keep his
eye on a level sufficiently constant to do away with aU sensible effects of parallax
on the position of the hair relatively to the black circles. The framework
carrying the stretched platinum wire and moveable attracted disk is above the
brass roof of the lantern, in which a square aperture is cut to allow the square
portion constituting the short arm of the aluminium balance to be attracted
downwards by the fixed attracting disk (§ 7), to be presently described.

A side view of the attracting plate, the brass roof of the lantern, the alu-

minium balance, the sight-plate, the hair, and the plano-convex lens is
shown in section (fig. 2), also a glass upper roof to protect the gauge and the
interior of the instrument below from dust and disturbance by currents of
air, to which, without this upper roof, it would be exposed, through the small
vacant space round tlic moveable aluminium square. The fixed attracting
disk is borne by a vertical screw screwing into the upper brass mounting
(z, fig. 2) (§ 7), connected with the inner coating of the Leyden jar, through
the guard tubes, &c., and is secured in any position by the " jam nut," shown
in the drawings at r, fig. 2. This disk (s) is circular, and about 38 millimetres
(1|- inch) diameter, and it is placed horizontally with its centre under the

centre of the square aperture in the roof of the lantern. Its distance

from the lower surface of the roof and of the moveable attracted disk may
be from 2jr to 5 millimetres (from J^- to ^ of an inch), and is to be adjusted,

 along with the amount of torsion in the platinum wire bearing the aluminium
 halance-arm, so as to give the proper sensibility to the gauge. The sensibility
 is increased by diminishing the distance from the attracting to the attracted
 plate, and increasing the amount of torsion. Or, again, the degree of the
 potential indicated by it when the hair is in the sighted position is increased
 by increasing the distance between the plates, or by diminishing the amount

 of torsion. If the electrification of the needle is too great, its proper position
 of equilibrium becomes unstable ; or before this there is sometimes a liability

 to discbarge by a spark across some of the air-spaces. The instrument works

 extremely weU with the needle charged but little less than to give rise to one

 or both of these faults, and I adjust the gauge accordingly.
    § l-t. The strength of the fixed steel-directing magnets is to be adjusted to

 give the desired amount of deflection with any stated difi'erence of potentials
maintained between the two chief electrodes, when the jar is charged to the
 degree which brings the hair of the gauge to its sighted position. In the
instruments already made, the deflection* by a single ceU of Daniell's amounts
to about 100 scale-divisions (of jL of an inch each at a distance of 40 inches),
when the magnetic directive force is such 'as to give a period of vibration

equal to about 1'5 secoud. When the jar is discharged and the four

quadrants are connected with one another and witli the inner coating of the

jar, lower degrees of sensibiHty may be attained better by increasing the

magnetic directing-force than by diminishing the charge of the jar. Thus,
for instance, when it is to be used for measuring and photograiibically re-
cording the potential of atmospheric electricity at the point where the stream
of the water-dropping collector t breaks into di'ops, the magnetic directing-
force maj'^ be made from 10 to 100. times more than that just described.

When this is to be done it may be convenient to attach a somewhat more

powerful magnetic needle than that which has been made in the most recent
instruments where a high degree of sensibility is desired. Eut it is to be re-
marked that in general the directing-force of the external steel magnets

cannot be too sti'ong, as the stronger it is the less is the disturbance produced
by changing magnetic bodies in the neighbourhood of the instrument. In
laboratory work, where numerous magnetic experiments are being performed
in the immediate neighbourhood, and in telegraph factories where there is
constant disturbance by large moving masses of iron, the artificial magnetic

field of the electrometer ought to be made very strong. To allow this, and

yet leave suificient sensibility to the instrument, the suspended magnetic

needle has been made smaller and smaller, until it is now reduced to two

small pieces of steel side by side, 6 millimetres (^ of an inch) long. For a
meteorological observatorj^ all that is necessary is, that the directing magnetic
force should be so great that the greatest disturbance experienced in mag-
netic storms shall not sensibly deflect the luminous image J.

    § 15. The sensibility of the gauge should be so adjusted that a variation
in the charge of the jar, producing an easily perceived change in the position
of the hair, shall produce no sensible change in the deflection of the luminous
image produced by the greatest difference of potentials between the qua-
drants, which is to be measured in the use of the instrument. I beheve the

   * That is to say, the number of scale-divisions over which the himinous image moves
when the chief electrodes are disconnected from one another and put in metallic connexion
with the two plates of a Daniell's battery.

instruments already made, when adjusted to Miil these conditions, may be
trusted to measure the difference of potentials produced by* single cell of

Daniell's to an accuracy of a quarter per cent. · It must be remembered that

the constancy of value of the unit of each instrument depends not only on

the constancy of the potential indicated by the gauge, but also on the con-

stancy of the force in the field traversed by the suspended needle. As both
these may be expected to decrease gradually from year to year (although very

slowly after the first few hours or weeks), rigorous methods must be adopted

to take such variations into account, if the instrument is to be trusted to as

gh-ing accurately comparable indications at all times. The only method

hitherto provided for this most important object consists in the observation

of the deflection produced by a measured motion of one of the quadrants by

the micrometer-screw («) when the four quadrants are put in metallic com-

--munication with one another through the principal electrodes -the force

producing this deflection when the potential of the jar is constant ; and there-
fore, the jar being brought to one constant potential by aid of the gauge, the
amount of the deflection will show whether or not the force of the magnetic

field has changed, and will render it easy at any time to adjust the strength

of the magnets, if necessary, to secure this constancy. But to attain this ob-
ject by these means, the three quadrants not moved by the micrometer-screw

must be clamped by their fixing-screws so that they may be always in the

same position.

§ 16. The al)solute constancy of the gauge cannot be altogether relied upon.

It certainly changes to a sensible degree with temperature, and to very dif-

ferent degrees, and even in different directions, as will be seen (§ 32) in con-
nexion with the description of the portable electrometer to be given later.
But this temperature variation does not amount in ordinary cases probably

to as much as one per cent. ; and it is probable that after a year or two any

further secular variation of the platinum torsion sj)ring will "be quite insen-

sible. It is to be remarked, however, that secular experiments on the elas-

ticity of metals are wanting, and ought at least to be commenced in our

generation. In the meantime it ^dll be desirable, both on account of the

temperature variation and of the possible secular variation in the couple of

torsion, to check the gauge by accurate measurements of the time of oscilla-

tion of the needle with its appurtenances. The moment of inertia of this

rigid body, except in so far as it may be influenced by oxidation of the metal,

of which I have as yet discovered no signs, may be regarded as constant,

and therefore the amount of the directing coviple due to the magnets may be

determined with great accuracy by finding the period of an oscillation when

the four quadrants are put in connexion through the charging rod with the

metal mounting bearing the guard plates, &c. I have not as yet put into

practice any of the obvious methods, founded on the general "principle of

coincidences used in pendulum observations, for determining the period of the

oscillation                                           but although not  more  than twenty or thirty oscillations can be
                                                   ;

counted, it seems certain that with a little trouble the period of one of them

piay be determined without much trouble to an accuracy of about -j-L per cent.

\Tith the earth, is attracted by a fixed insulated conductor, which is electrified,

and, for the sake of keeping its electric potential constant, is connected with

the inner coating of a Leyden battery. The first result which he announced
is, that, when other circumstances remain the same, the attraction varies with
the square of the quantity of electricity with which the insulated body is

charged ; but '· it is readily seen that, in the case of ilr. Harris's cxperi-
 ·' ments, it will be so slight on the unopposed portions that it could not be
 ' perceived without experiments of a very refined nature, such as might

 ' be made by the proof plane of Coulomb, which is, in fact, with a slight
 ' modification, the instrument employed by Mr. Faraday in the investigation.

' Now to the degree of approximation to which the intensity on the unop-

' posed parts may be neglected, the laws observed by Mr. Harris when the

 ' opposed surfaces are plane raay be readily deduced from the mathematical
 ' theorv. Thus let v be the potential in the interior of A, the charged body,
 ' a quantity which will depend solely on the state of the interior coating

A' of the battery with which, in Mr. Harris's experiments, is connected,

' to the uninsulated opposed body B. Let a be the distance between the

A' plane opposed faces of and B, and let S be the area of the opposed parts

' of these faces, which will in general be the area of the smaller, if they be

' unequal. When the distance a is so small that we may entirely neglect

' the intensity on all the unopposed parts of the bodies, it is readily shown,

' from the mathematical theory, that (since the difference of the potentials at

A' the surfaces of and B is v) the intensity of the electricity produced by

' induction at any point of the portion of the surface of B which is opposed

A --' to is - , the intensity at anv point which is not so situated being

' of the surface of B, will be in a direction perpendicular to the plane and

" experiments in the case when the opposed surfaces are plane " f.

   § 18. After many trials to make an absolute electrometer founded on the

repulsion between two electrified spherical conductors for which I had given
a convenient mathematical formidain § 4 of the paper just qiioted, it occiu-red

to me to take advantage of the fact noticed by Harris, but easily seen as an

immediate consequence of Green's mathematical theory, that the mutual

attraction between two conductors used as in his experiments is but little

influenced by the form of the unopposed jiarts ; and in 1853, in a paper " On

transient Electric Currents " J, I described a method for measuring differences
of electric potential in absolute electrostatic measure founded on that idea.
The " absolute electrometer," which I exhibited to the British Association at
its Glasgow Meeting in 18-5.5, was constructed for the purpose of putting

these methods in practice. This instnmient consists of a plane metal disk

insulated in a fixed horizontal position with a somewhat smaller fixed metal

disk hung centrally over it, from one end of the beam of a balance. In two
papers entitled " Measurement of Electostatic Porce produced by a Battery "
and " Measurement of the Electromotive Force required to produce a spark in
Air between parallel metal plates at different distances," published in the Pro-

ceedings of the Royal Society* for February 1860, I described applications

of this electrometer, in which, for the first time I believe, absolute electro-

static measurements were made. The calcidations of diiferences of potentials
in absolute measure -were made according to the formula quoted above (§ 17)

from my old paper on " The Elementary Laws of Statical Electricity."

    § 19. This formula is rigorous only if the distance between the disks is

myinfinitely small in comparison with their diameters ; and therefore, in

earliest attempt to make absolute electrostatic measurements, I used very

small distances. I found great difiiculty in securing that the distance should
be nearly enough equal between diff'erent parts of the plates, and in measu-
ring its absolute amount with sufficient accuracy ; and found besides serious

inconveniences in respect of sensibility and electric range : later I made a
great improvement in the instrument by making only a small central area
of one of the disks moveable. Thus the electric part of the instrument
becomes two large parallel plates with a cii'cidar aperture in one of them,
nearly filled up by a light circular disk supported properly to admit of its
electrical attraction towards the other being accurately measured in absolute
units of force. The disk and the perforated plate surrounding it will be
called, for brevity, the disk and the guard-plate. The faces of these two
next the other plate must be as nearly as possible in one plane when the

disk is precisely in the position for measuring its electric force, which, for
brevity, will be called its sighted position. The space between the disk and
the inner edge of its guard-ring must be a very small part of the diameter
of the aperture, and must be very small in comparison with the distance

between the plates ; but the diameter of the disk may be greater than, equal

to, or less than the distance between the plates.
    § 20. Mathematical theory shows that the electric attraction experienced

by the disk is the same as that experienced by a certain part of one of two
infinite planes at the same distance, with the same difference of electric
potentials, this area being very approximately the mean between the area
 of the aperture and the area of the disk, and that the approximation is very
good, even although the distance between the plates be as much as a fourth or
fifth, and the diameter of the disk as much as three-fourths of the diameter of

 the smaller of the two plates. This conclusion will be readily assented to

 when we consider thatf the resultant electric force at any point in the air

 between the two plates is equal numerically to the rate of conduction of
 heat per unit area across the corresponding space in the following thermal

 analogue. Let a solid of uniform thermal conductivity replace all the air
 between and round the plates ; and in place of the plates let there be hollow
 spaces in this solid. Let these hollow spaces be kept at two uniform tempe-

 ratures, differing by a number of degrees equal numerically to the differ-

 ence of potentials in the electric system, the space corresponding to the

 disk and guard-ring being at one temperature, and that corresponding to tlie
 opposite plate at the other temperature ; and let the thermal conductivity of

 the solid be unity. If we attempt to draw the isothermal surfaces between

tlie hollow corresponding to the continuous plate on the one side, and that

corresponding to the disk and guard-ring ou the other side, we see immediately
that they must be very nearly plane, from very near the disk all the way

across to the corresponding central portion of the opposite plate, but that
there will be a convexity towards the annular space between the disk and

o uard-ring.

   § 21. Thus we see that the resultant electric force will, to a very close

--approximation, be equal to for all points of the aii* between the plates at

distances from the outer bounding edges exceeding two or three times the

distance between the plates, and at distances from the interstice between the

guard-ring and disk any less than the breadth of this interstice. Hence if p
denote the electric density of any point of the plate or disk far enough from

the edges, wo have

                         V

                    " = 4^-

   But the outward force experienced by the surface of the electrified conduc-

tor per unit of area at any point is 2wp^, and therefore if F denote the force

Aexperienced by any area of the fixed plate, anj- part of which comes near

its edge, we have

which ynU. clearly be equal to the attraction experienced by the moveable

                                 -- , the

formula by which dilference of potentials in absolute electrostatic measure
is calculated from the result of a measurement of the force F, which, it must

Wbe remembered, is to be expressed in kinetic units. Thus if be the mass

in grammes to which the weight is equal, we have

where fj is the force of gravity in centimetres per second.
    The difficulty which, in first applying this method about twelve years ago,

I found in measuring accurately the distance I) between the plates and in

avoiding error from their not being rigorously parallel, I now elude by

measuring only differences of distance, and deducing the desired results from
the difference of the corresponding diflercnccs of potentials. Thus let Y' be
the difference of potentials between the plates required to give the same force

F ; when the difference of potentials is V' instead of Y, we have

                     Y'-Y=(D'-D). /^.

  --§ 22. The plan of proceeding wliich I now use is as foUows : Each plate

.(fig. 11, Plate YI.) is insulated ; one of them, the continuous one, for instance,
-is kept at a potential diftering from the earth by a fixed amount tested by aid
of a separate idiostatic® electrometer; the other plate (the guard-ring and
moveable disk in metallic communication with one another) is alternately
connected with the earth and with the bod)' whose ])otential is to be

measured. The lower plate is moved iip or down by a micrometer- screw
imtil the moveable dislv balances in a definite position, indicated by the hair
 (with background of white with black dots) seen through a lens, as shown in
fig. 11. Before and after commencing each series of electrical experiments,

the amount of weight to be placed on the upper side of the disk to bring the
hair to its sighted position when there is no electric force is determined.
This last condition is secured by putting the two plates in metallic commu-
nication with one another. For the electric experiments the weight is

removed, so that when the hair is in the sighted position the electric attraction
on the moveable disk is equal to the force of gravity on the weight. The

electric connexions suitable in using this instrument for determining in

absolute electrostatic measure the difference of potentials maintained by
a galvanic battery between its two electrodes are indicated in fig. 11.
'No details as to the case for preventing disturbance by em-rents of aii-, and

for maintaining a diy atmosphere, by aid of pumice impregnated mth strong

sulphm-ic acid, are shown, because they are by no means convenient in the

instrument at present in use, which has undergone so many transformations

that scarcely any part of the original structure remains. I hope soon to
constract a compact instrument convenient for general use. The amount of

force which is constant in each series of experiments may be varied from one

series to another by changing the position of a small wire rider on the lever

from which the moveable disk is liung.
   The electric system here described is heterostatic (§ 40 below), there being

an independent electrification besides that whose difference of potential is to

be measured.

                                        POETABLE ElECTKOMETER.

   § 23. In the ordinary use of the portable electrometer (figs. 8, 9, & 10,

Plate VI.), the electric system is heterostatic and quite similar to that of the

absolute electrometer, when used in the manner described above in § 22.
But the balance is not adapted for absolute measure of the amount of force
of attraction experienced by the moveable disk ; on the contrary, it is pre-

cisely the same as that described for the gauge of the quadrant electrometer
in § 13 above, only tui'ucd upside down. Thus, iu the portable instrument,
the square disk (/) forming part of the lever of thin sheet aluminium is
attracted upwards by a sohd circular disk of sheet-brass {y), thick enough
for stiffness. Every part of the aluminium lever except this square portion
is protected from electric attraction by a fixed brass plate Qih) with a square

hole in it, as nearly as may be stopped by the square part of the sheet

aluminium destined to experience the electric attraction, all other parts of
the aluminium balance-lever being below this g-uard-plate. The aluminium

lever {i Jc), as shown in figs. 8 & 10, is shaped so that Avhen the hair (I) at

the long end of its lever is in its sighted position, the upper sm-faces of the
fixed guard-plate (h) and moveable aluminium square (_/') are as nearly as

may be in one plane. The mode of siLspension is precisely the same as that

described (§ 13) for the gauge of the quackaut electrometer. In the portable
instrument, careful attention is given by the maker to balance the aluminium

lever by adding to it small masses of shellac or other convenient substance,

so that its centre of gravity may be in the line of its piatinum-wii-e axis,

or, more properly speaking, in such a position that the instrument shall give,
when electrified, the same " earth-readings " when held in any positions,
cither upright, or inchned, or inverted (§ 30 below). Thus the condition of

equilibrium of the balance, when the hair is in its sighted position, i» that
the moment of electric attraction round the axis of suspension shall be equal
to the moment of the couple of torsion, the latter being as constant as the

properties of the matter concerned (platinum wire, brass stretching-springs,

&c.) will allow.
--503 REPOBT 1867.

   § 24. The guard-plate earrying, by the platinum-wire suspeusion, the alu-
minium balance, is attached to the bottom of a small glass Leyden jar (m m),

and is in permanent metallic communication with its inside coating of tinfoil.

The outside tinfoil- coating of this jar is in permanent metalHc communication
with the outside brass-protecting case. The upper open mouth of this case

is closed by a lid or roof, which bears on its underside a firm frame projecting

Vdownwards. This frame has two notches, in which a stout brass tube (o)

slides, kept in the Vs by a properly placed spring (p), giving it freedom to slide

mup and down in one definite hue*. Firmly fixed the upper end of this tube

is a nut («, fig. 8), which is caused to move up and down bj' a micrometer-
screw. The lower end of the shaft of this screw has attached to it a convex

piece of polished steel (b, fig. 8), which is pressed upon a horizontal agate-
plate rigidly attached to the framework above mentioned by a stiff' brass piece

projecting into the interior of the brass tube through a slot long cnoxigh to

allow the requisite range of motion. This arrangement will be readily under-

stood from the accompanying drawings. It has been designed upon obvious geo-

metrical principles, which have been hitherto neglected, so far as I know, in all

micrometer-screw mechanisms, whctlier for astronomical instruments or other

pui'poses. The screw-shaft is turned by a milled head, fixed to it at ics top

outside the roof of the instrument, and the angles through which it is turned

are read on a circle divided into 100 equal parts of the circumference (or 3°'(>

each) from a fixed mark on the roof of the instrument. The hole in the roof

through which the screw-shaft passes is wide enough to allow the shaft to

turn without touching it, and the lower edge of the graduated circle turning

with the screw is everywhere very near the upper side of the roof, but must

Anot touch it at any point.  second nut (c, fig. 8) above the eftcctive nut fits

easily, but somewhat accurately, in the hollow brass tube, but is prevented

from turning round in the tube by a proper projection and slot. Thus the

screw is rendered sufficiently steady, -with reference to the sliding-tube ; that

is to say, it is prevented from any biit excessively small rotations roimd axis

perpendicular to the length of the screw-shaft ; and when the nut is kept

from being turned round its proper axis, it forms along with the sliding-tube

Avirtually a rigid body.  carefully arranged spiral spring presses the two

nuts asunder, and so causes the vippcrsides of the thread of the screw-shaft

always to press against the underside of the thread of the eflfective nut,

thus doing away with what is teclmically called in mechanics " lost time."'

In turning the micrometer-screw, the operator presses its head gently down-

wards with his finger, to secure that its lower end bears firmly upon the agate-

plate. It would be the reverse of an improvememt to introduce a spring

attached to the roof of the instrument outside to press the screw head down-

wards, inasmuch as however smooth the top of the screw-shaft might be

made, and however smooth the spring pressing it down, there would still be

a very injm-ious friction impeding the proper settlement of the sHduig-tubc

Ainto its Vs.  stiff fork (^) stretching over the graduated circle is firmly

attached to the roof outside, to prevent the screw from being lifted up by

more than a very small space                                                                                                        perhaps not more than -J- of an inch at most.
                                                                                                                                 ;

In using the instriiment, the observer shoiild occasionally pull up the screw-

head and press it down again, and give it small horizontal motions, to make

   * In consequence of suggestions by Mr. Jenkin, it is probable tliat the spring may be
done away with, and the Vs replaced by rings approximately fitting round the tube, 'but
leaving it quite tree to fall down by its own weight. In consequence of the symmetrical

position of the convex end of the screw over the centre of the attracted disk, slight lateral

motions of the tube produce no sensible effect on the electric attraction.

sure that when lie is using it it is pressed in properly to its Vs and down upon

Athe agate-plate.  long arm (d, figs. 8 and 9) (or two arms one above the

other), firmly attached to the sliding-tube, carries a pointer which moves up

and down with it. Two fixed guiding-cheeks on each side of this pointer
prevent the tube from being carried round too far in either direction when the

screw is turned : one of these cheeks is graduated so that each division is equal

in length to the step of the micrometer-screw ; this enables the operator to

ascertain the number of times he has turned the screw. These two checks

must never simultaneously press upon the sliding-pointer ; on the contrary,

they must leave it a slight amount of lateral freedom to move. If this

does not amount to -36 of a degree, the amount of " lost time " produced by

it will not exceed J^ of a division of the micrometer-circle, and will not pro-

Aduce any sensible error in the use of the instrument.  glass rod cemented

to the lower end of the tube prolongs its axis downwards, and bears the

continuous attracting- plate of the electrometer at its loAver end.

The object aimed at in the mechanism just described is to prevent the nut

and other parts rigidly connected with it from any other motion than parallel
to one definite line, and to leave it freedom to move in this line, unimpeded

by any other friction than that which is indispensable in the arrangement

for keeping the sliding tube in its Vs.

   § 25. If the inner tinfoil covering of the Leyden jar were completed up to
the guard-plate bearing the aluminium balance, the long arm of this lever

being in the interior of a hollow conductor would experience no electric in-
fluence, and no force from the electrification of the Leyden jar, or from

separate electrification of the upper attracting-plate, or, more strictly
speaking, the electric density and consequent electric force on the long arm

of the lever would be absolutely insensible to the most refined test we coidd

apply, because of the smallness of the gap between the moveable aluminium
square and the boundary of the square aperture in the guard-plate. But to

see the hair on the long end of the lever, and the white background with
black dots behind it, a good portion of the glass under the guard-plate must

be cleared of tinfoil outside and inside. Thus the electric potential of the

inner coating of the Leyden jar will not be continued quite uniformly over

the inner surface of the bared portion of the glass, and a disturbance affecting
chiefly the most sensitive part of the lever will be introduced. To diminish

this as much as possible without inconveniently impeding vision, a double

screen of thin wire fences, in metallic communication with the inner tinfoil

coating and the guard-plate, is introduced between the end of the lever and

the glass through which it is observed.

  A§ 26. very light spiral spring (?·) connects the ixppor attracting-plate with

a brass piece supported upon a fixed vertical glass column projecting down-

wards from the roof of the instrument. This brass piece bears a stout wire (s),

called the main electrode, projecting vertically upwards along the axis of a

brass tube open at each end, fixed in an aperture in the roof so as to project

upwards and downwards, as shown in fig. 9.

   § 27. The top of the main electrode bears a brass shding-piece (t), which,
when raised a little, serves for umbrella and wind-guard without disturbing the

insulation ; and when pressed down closes the aperture and puts the electrode

in metallic connexion with the roof of the instrument. When the instru-

ment is to be used for atmospheric electi'icity (unless at a fixed station), a

steel wire, about 20 centimetres long, is placed in the hole on the top of the

sliding brass piece just mentioned, and is thus held in the vertical position.

A burning match is attached to its upper end, which has the efiect of

bringing the potential of the chief electrode and upper attracting-plate &c.
all to the potential of the air at the point where the match burns*. The
instrument is either held in the observer's hand, or it is placed upon a fixed

support, and care taken that its outer brass case is in connexion with the

earth. When the diiference of potentials between two conductors is to be

tested, one of these is connected with the brass case of the instrument, and

the other with the chief electrode, the umbrella being kept up. If both

of these condiictors must be kept insulated from the earth, the brass case of

the electrometer must be put on an insulating stand, and the micrometer-

screw turned by an insiilating handle.

  A§ 28. lead cup {e e, fig. 8), supported bj metal pillars from the roof and

carrying pieces of pumice-stone, held in their place by India-rubber bands,
completes the instrument. The inner surface of the glass must be clean, and

particles of dust, minute shreds or fibres, &c. removed as carefully as possible,

especially from the lower surface of the upper attracting-plate, and the ujiper

surface of the guard-plate and aluminium square facing it from below. The
pumice is prepared by moistening it with a few drops of strong pure sulphiirio

acid. Ordinary sulphuric acid of commerce should be boiled with sulphate of
ammonia to free it from volatile acid vapours, and to strengthen it sufficiently
by removing water if the acid be not of the strongest. There should not be

so much acid applied to the pumice as to make it have the appearance of

being moist, but there must be enough to maintain a sufficiently dry atmo-
sphere within tlie instrument for very perfect insulation of the Leyden jar,
which I find does not in general lose more of its charge than 5 per cent, per
week, when the pumice is properly acidulated. Thus there is no tendency
of the liquid to drop out of the pumice ; and the pumice being properly

secured by the india-rubber bands, the instrument may be thrown about

with any force, short of that which might break the glass jar or either of
the glass stems, without doing any damage ; but to ensure this hardiness
the sheet aluminium of which the balance is made must be very thin. After

several weeks' use the jmmice may commence to look moist, and even slight
traces of moisture may be seen on the outside of the lead cup, in conse-

quence of watery vapour attracted by the sulphuric acid from the atmosphere
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

but the piimicc should then be taken and dried. At all events this must be
done in good time, before enough of liquid has collected to give anj' tendency
to drop. In all climates in which I have hitherto tested the instrument,
I have found the piimice cftcctive for insulation and safe in keeping all the

liquid to itself for two months. But it having been reported to me by Mr.
Becker that many instruments have been returned to him in a ruinous con-

dition from drops of sulphuric acid having become scattered through their

metal work, I now cause to be engraved conspicuously on the outer case of
the instrument " pumice dangekous, if not deied once a MONin ;" also a

frame carrying a card, on which the dates of drying are inscribed, to bo
placed in a convenient position on the roof of the instrument.

    § 29. To prep;irc the instrument for nse, the inner coating of the Leyden.
jar must be charged through a charging rod, insulated in a vulcanite or
glass tube, and let down for the occasion through a hole in the roof of the
instrument, by aid of a small electrophorus, which generally accompanies
the instrument, or hy an electrical macliiue. I generally prefer to give a
negative charge to the inner coating, as I have not found any phy-
sical reason, such as that mentioned in § 9 above, to prefer a positive charge

to a negative cliarge ; aud the negative charge givca increased readings of

the micrometer, in the ordinary use of the instrument, to correspond to

positive charges of the principal electrode, as will be presently explained.

Before commencing to charge the jar, the upper attracting-plate should be

moved to nearly the highest position of its range by the micrometer-screw,

otherwise too strong a force of electric attraction may be put upon the

aluminium square ; and besides, the jar will discharge itself between the

upper plate and the extreme edge of the aluminium square, pulled as it is

very much above the level of the guard-plate by the electric attraction. I

have not found any injury or change of electric value of the scale-divisions

to aiise from any such rough usage ; but still, to guard against such a possi-

bility, I propose to add to the guard-plate cheeks to prevent the corners of

the aluminium from rising much, if at all, above its level, and to conduct the

discharge and protect the aluminiiim and platinum from the shock, in case of

the upper plate being brought too near the lower. When the instrument is

being charged, or when it is out of use at any time, the umbrella should

always  be  kept  down                            but it must be raised to  insulate  the principal elec-
                                               ;

trode, of course, before proceeding to apply this to a body whose difference

of potential from a body connected with the case of the instrument is to be

measured.

§ 30. In using the instrument the iimbrella must very frequently be lowered,

or metallic communication established in any other convenient way between

the chief electrode and the outer brass case, the micrometer-screw turned

until the hair takes its sighted position, and the reading taken, the hundreds

being read on the interior vertical scale, and the units (or single divisions of

the circle) on the graduated circle above. The number thus found is called

the earth-reading. It measures the distance from an arbitrary zero position

to the position in which the upper attracting-plate must be placed to give

the amount of electric force on the aluminium square which balances the

Alever in its sighted position.                   constant added to the earth-reading, or sub-

tracted from it, gives (§ 1) a number simply proportional to the difference
of potentials between the upper and lower plate ; that is to say, between the
two coatings of the Leyden jar. The vertical scale and micrometer-circle

are numbered, so that increased distances between the plates gives increased

readings ; and the zero reading should correspond as nearly as may be to
zero distance between them ; although in the instruments hitherto made

no pains have been taken to secure this condition, even somewhat approxi-
mately. If it is desired to know the constant, an electrical experiment
must be made to determine it, which is done with ease ; but this is not

necessary for the ordinary use of the instrument, which is as follows.

    § 31. First, an earth-reading is taken, then the upper electrode is insulated
by raising the umbreUa, or otherwise breaking connexion between the prin-
cipal electrode and the outer metal case of the instrument. The principal
electrode and the outer case are then connected with the two bodies whose

difference of potential is to be determined, and the micrometer-screw is

turned until the hair is brought to its sighted position. The reading of
Inmdreds on the vertical scale and units on the circle is then taken. Lastly,

the principal electrode is again connected with the case of the instrument

and another earth-reading is taken. If the second earth-reading differs

from the first, the obser-ver must estimate the most probable earth-reading
for the moment when the hair was in its sighted position, with the upper

plate and the metal case in connexion with the two bodies whose difference

of potential is-to be measured. The estimated earth-reading is to be svib-

tracted from the readiug taken in connexion with the hodies to he tested.
This diflPerence measures (§ 21) the required difference of potentials between
them iu units of the instrument. The yalue of the unit of the instrument

ought to be known in absolute electrostatic measure ; and the difference of
reading found in any experiment is to be multiplied by this, which is called

(§1) the absolute coefficient of the instrument, to give the required dif-
ference of potentials in absolute measure. It so happens that, in the
portable electrometers cf the kind now" described which have been hitherto
constructed, the absolute coefficient is somewhere about -01, so that one turn
of the screw, or 100 divisions of the circle, corresponds to somewhere
about one electrostatic unit, with a gramme for the unit of mass, a centi-
metre for the unit of distance, and a second for the unit of time ; but the
different instruments differ from one another by as much as ten or twenty
per cent, in their absolute coefficients. In all of these I have fouud between

three and four Daniell's cells to correspond to the unit division ; that is to
say, between three hundred and four hundred cells to a full turn of the

screw. With great care, the observer may measure small differences of

potentials by this instrument to the tenth part of a division (or to about
half a Daniell's cell). With a very moderate amount of practice ard care,

an error of as much as a half division may be avoided in each reading.
    § 32. But there are imperfections in the instrument itself which make it

difficult or impossible to secure very minute accuracy, especially in measure-

ments throiigh wide ranges.

   (1) In the first place, I am not sure that the end of the needle

carrj-ing the hair is protected sufficiently by the wire fences (§ 25) from
electric disturbance to provide against any error from this source, which

possibly introduces serious irregularities.

    (2) In the second place, the capacity of the jar in the small portable
instrument is not sufficient to secure that the potential of its inner coating
shall not differ sensibly with the different distances to which the upper plate

is brought, to balance the aluminium lever with the hair in its sighted po-
sition. But on this point it is to be remarked that the electric density on
the upper surface of the guard-plate is in its central parts always the same

when the hair is in its sighted position ; and it is therefore only the compa-

ratively small diflPerence of the quantity of electricity on this surface, towards

the rim, corresponding to different distances of the attracted plate, that
causes diflPerence of potential in the inner coating of the jar. But if the upper

attracting-plate be kept for several minutes at any distance, diftering by a
few turns of the screw, from that which brings the hair to its sighted
position, the electricity creeps along the inner unconnected surface of the

glass so as to increase the charge of the inner metallic coating, or diminish

it, according as the distance is too great or too small. If then quickly the

screw be turned and the earth-reading taken, it is found greater or smaller,

as the case may be, than previously ; but after a few minutes more it returns
to its previous value very approximately. Error from this source may be

 practically avoided by taking care never to allow the hair to remain for more

 than a few minutes far from its sighted position ; never so far, for instance,
 as above the centre of the upper, or below the centre of the lower dots.

    A(3) third source of error arises from change of temperature influencing

 the indications. In most of the instruments hitherto made 1 have found
 that the warmth of the hand produces in a few minutes a very notable aug-
 mentation of the earth-reading (as it were an increased charge in the jar) ;
 but in the last instrument which I have tested (White No, 18) I find the
ON STANDARDS 01' ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE.                            507

reverse effect, the earth-reading becoming smaller as the instrument is

warmed, or larger when it is cooled. I have ascertained that these changes

are not due to changes in the electric capacities of the Ley den jars ; and I
have found that the change, if any, of specific inductive capacity of glass by

change of temperature is excessively small, in comparison to what would be

required to account for the temperature errors of these instruments, which

probably must be due to thermo-elastic properties of the platinum wire, or

of the stretching-springs, or of the aluminium balance-lever, or to a com-

bination of the effects depending on such properties ; but I have endeavoured

in vain, for several years, and made many experiments, to discover the precise

cause. It surely will be found, and means invented for remedying the error,

now when I have an instrument in which the error is in the opposite di-

rection to that of most of the other instruments. It is of course mi;ch

greater in some instruments than in others : in some it is so great that the
earth-reading is varied by as much as twenty divisions by the warmth of the

hand in the course of five or ten minutes after commencing to use the in-

strument, if it has been previoiisly for some time iu a cold place. Its in-

fluence may be eliminated, not quite rigorously, but nearly enough so for most

practical jiurposes, by frequently taking earth-readings (§ 30) and proceeding

according to the directions of § 31.

  A(4) fourth fault in the ijortable electrometer is, that the diameter of

the guard-plate and upper attracting disk, which ought to be infinite, are not

sufiiciently great, in proportion to the greatest distance between them, to

Arender the scale quite uniform in its electric value throughout.  careful

observer will, however, remedy the greater part of the error due to this

defect, by measuring experimentally the relative (or absolute) values of the

scale-division in different parts of the range. There will, however, remain

uncorrected some irregularity, due to influence of the distribution of elec-

tricity over the uncoated inner surface, in the instruments as hitherto made,

in all of which the inner surface of the jar is coated with tinfoil only below

the guard-plate, so that the uj^per surface of the gTiard-jjlate may be seen
clearlj-, in order that the observer may always see that all is in order about

the ahimiuium square and aperture round it ; and particularly that there

arc no injurious shreds or minute fibres. But the irregular influence of the

electrification of the uncoated glass, if foimd sensible, will be rendered insen-

sible l)y continuing the tinfoil coating an inch above the upper surface of

the guard-plate.

    § 33. All faults, except the temperature error, depend on the smallness of
the instrument ; and if the observer chooses to regard as portable an instru-
ment of thirty centimetres (or a foot) diameter, with all other dimensions,
and all details of construction, the same as those of the instrument described

above, he may have a portable electrometer practically free from three of the

four faults described. But it is scarcely to be expected that a small instru-

ment (12i centimetres high, and 8| centimetres in diameter) which may be

carried about in the pocket can be free from such errors. They are,
however, so far remedied as to be probably not perceptible in the large sta-
tionary instrument which I now proceed to describe.

                                       Standard Electeometee.

   § 34. This instrument (figs. 12, 13,& 14, Plate VI.) differs from the portable
electrometer only in dimensions, and in certain mechanical details, which are
arranged to give greater accuracy by taking advantage of freedom from the exi-
gencies of a small portable instrument. It is at present called the standard
508 KEroRT--18G/.

electrometer, in anticipation of either remedying, or of learning to perfectly
allow for, the temperature error, and of finding by secnlar experiments on the
elasticity of metals, that their properties used in the instrument are satisfactory
as regards the permanence from year to year, and from century to century, of
the electric value of its reading. It is an instrument capable of being applied
with great ease to very accurate measurements of differences of potential, in

terms of its own unit. The value of the unit for each such standard instru-
ment ought, of course, to be determined with the greatest possible accuracy

in absolute measure ; and until confidence can be felt as to its secular con-
stancy, determinations should frequently ])e made by aid of the absolute

electrometer.

    § 35. The Leyden jar of the standard electrometer consists of a large thin
white-glass shade coated inside and outside to within 6 centimetres of its lip,
and placed over the instrument as an ordinary glass shade, to protect against

dust, currents of air, and change of atmosphere. It may bo removed at plea-

sure from the cast-iron sole of the instrument, and then the interior works

are seen, consisting of

   A(1) continuous disk of brass supported on a glass stem, in prolongation

of a stout brass rod or tube sliding vertically in Vs, in which it is kept ,by
a spring, and resting with its lower fiat end on the upper end of a micrometer-
screw shaft, shown in fig. 13, where the screw, graduated circle, and stout
brass rod are as seen in the instrument ; the perforated brass disk (which is
intended to keep the round upper end of the screw-shaft in position) is
shown in section in fig. 14.

    (2) Eesting on three glass columns, a guard-plate with a square apertiire
in its centre, and carrying on its upper side stretching-springs and thin plati-
num-wii'e suspension of an aluminium balance-lever, shaped like those of the
gauge (§ 13) and the portable (§ 23) already described, but somewhat larger.
The tops of the three glass columns are rounded ; a round hole and a short
slot in line with this hole are cut in the guard-plate and receive the rounded
ends of two of the columns, which are somewhat longer than the third.
The flat smooth lower surface of the guard-plate rests simply on the top of
the third glass column. The diameter of the round hole and the breadth of

the slot in the guard-plate mav be about  of the diameter of curvature of

the upper hemispherical rounded ends of the glass column, so that the
bearing portions of the rounded ends in the round hole and in the slot re-

spectively may be inclined somewhere about 45° to the plane of the plate.

This well-known but too often neglected geometrical arrangement gives
perfect steadiness to the supported plate, without putting any transverse
strain ti]Don the supporting glass columns, siich as was almost inevitable, and

caused the breakage of many glass stems, before mental inertia opposing

deviations fit'om the ordinary instrument-maker's plan (of screwing the guard-
plate to brass mountings cemented to the tops of the glass columns) was over-
come. It has also the advantage of allowing the gnard-plate to be lifted off
and replaced in a moment.

    (3) Principal electrode projecting downwards through a hole in the sole
of the instrument, and rigidly supported from above by a brass mounting
cemented to the top of a thick vertical glass column, connected by a light
spu'al spring with the lower attracting-plate moved np and down by the

micrometer- screw. The aperture round the principal electrode may be

ordinarily stopped by a perforated column of well-paraffined vulcanite pro-
jecting some distance above and below the aperture, which I find to insulate
                                                                                                                             ;

                                                                ON STANDARDS OF ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE.                       509

extremely well, even in the smokj', dusty, and acidulated atmosphere of

Glasgow. When an extremely perfect insulation of the principal electrode

and connected attracting-plate is required, the vulcanite stopper surrounding-

it may be removed, so that the only communication between the electrode
and the case of the instrument may be along the two glass columns in the

artificially dried interior atmosphere of the case ; but from day to day, when

the instrument is out of use, the aperture round the principal electrode should

be kept carefully stopped, if not by a vulcanite insulator by a perforated cork

(although I find but little loss of insulation, either by the inner glass surface

of the Leyden jar or by the three glass columns, when this precaution is

neglected).

(4) Temporary charging-rod supported by a vertical perforated column of

paraffined vulcanite, or a glass tube well varnished outside and thickly paraf-

fined inside. The insulating column bearing this charging-rod is turned

round till a horizontal spring projecting from its upper end touches the inner

coating of the jar, when this is to be charged from an independent source,

or when, for any other experimental reason, it is to be put in connexion with

a conductor outside the case of the instriuuent.

  A(5) small replenisher of the kind described for the quadrant electrometer

(§ 12), but with much wider air-sjiaces to prevent discharge by sparks.

  A(6) large glass or lead dish to hold as large masses of pumice as may be,

which are to be kept sufficiently impregnated with strong sulphuric acid.

  A§ 36. considerable position of the jar above the guard-plate is left im-

coated to allow the observer to see easily the hair and white background with

black dots                                                      also several  other smaller parts of the  glass  above  the  guard-plate
                                                             ;

are left uncoated to admit light to allow a small circiUar level on the upper

side of the guard-plate to be seen. The long arm of the aluminium balance-

lever is very thoroughly guarded by double cages and fences of wire (§ 25),
so that it can experience no sensible influence from electric disturbing forces

when the covering jar is put in position and electric connexion is established

between its inner coating and the guard-plate by projecting flexible wires or

slips of metal.

   § 37. The aluminium square plate is somewhat larger, and the platinum
bearing wire somewhat longer in this instrument than in the portable electro-

meter, to render it sensible to smaller differences of potential. The step of
the screw is the same as in the portable (-^g of an iuch), and one division

(y^ of the circumference of the screw-head) corresponds to a diff'erence of

potentials which, roughly speaking, is equal to about that of a single cell of

DanieU's. The eff'ective range of the instrument is about sixty turns of the

screw, and therefore about 6000 cells of DanieU's. That of the portable

electrometer is about 15 turns of the screw (equivalent to about 5000 cells).

Neither of these instruments has sufficient range to measure the potential to
which Leyden jars are charged in ordinary electric experiments, or those

reached by the prime conductor of a powerful electric machine. The station-

ary instrument with its long screw and its large plates now described, would

go far towards meeting this want if its aluminium lever and platinum sus-
pension were made on the same scale as those of the portable electrometer

but for an instrument never wanted to directly measure differences of poten-

tials of less than two or three thousand cells, the heterostatic (§ 40) principle
is in general not iisefid, and therefore I have constructed the following very

simple idiostatic (§ 40) instrument, which is adapted to measure with con-

siderable accuracy differences of potential from 4000 cells upwards, to about

80,000 cells.

510 REPORT--1867.

LoNG-EANGE Electrometer.

§ 38. In this (fig. 15, Plate VI.) the continuous attracting-plate is above,

and the guard-plate with aluminium balance below, as in the portable elec-

trometer ; but, as in the standard stationary electrometer, the upper plate is

fixed and the lower plate is moved up and down by a micrometer-screw. The

mechanism of the screw and slide has aU the simpUcity and consequent accu-

racy of that of the standard electrometer. In the only long-range instrument

(^yet constructed the step of the screw is the same as that of the others  of

an inch). In future instruments it would be well either to have a longer step

or to have a simple mechanism (which can bo easily added) to give a quick

motion ; as in the use of the present instrument, the turning of the screw re-
quired for great changes of the potential measured is very tedious. The guard-

plate projects by more than an inch all round beyond the rim of the upper

attracting-plate partly to obviate the necessity of giving it a thick rim, which
                                                                                ;

would be required to prevent brushes and sparks originating in it, if it had

only the same diameter as the continuous plate above, and partly to guard

the observer from rcceiying a spark or shocli in measuring the potential of

an electric machine or of a Leyden battery, and to prevent the hair from being

attracted to the upper plate. Thus the guard-j^late is allowed to be no thicker

than sufiices for stiffness, and this allows the observer to see the hair at the

end of the aluminium balance-lever without the lever being made of a dy-

namically disadvantageous shape, as would be necessary if the guard-plate

were thick or had a thick rim added to it. No glass case is required for this

instrument. The smaUness of the needle and the greatness of the electric
force acting on it are such that I find in practice no disturbance to any in-
convenient degree by ordinary currents of air; although it and all these
attracted disk instruments show the influence of sudden change of baro-
metric pressure, such as that produced by opening or shutting a door. If
not kept under a glass shade when out of use, the lower surface of the upper
attracting-plate and the lower siu-face of the guard-plate and attracted alu-
minium square should be carefully dusted by a dry cool hand. Generally

speaking, none of the vital electric organs of an electrometer should be

touched by a cloth, as this is almost sure to leave shreds fatal to their healthy

action.

   § 39. The effective range of this instrument is about 200 tiirns of the screw;
rather greater force of torsion is given than in the portable electrometer, and
a rather smaller attracted disk may be used, so that upwards of four cells
maybe the electric value of one division. The instrument in its present state

measures nearly but not quite the highest potential I can ordinarily produce
in the conductor of a good Winter's electric machine, which sometimes gives

sparks and brushes a foot long.
   § 40. The classification of electrometers given above is founded on the shape

and kinematic relations of their chief organic parts ; but it will be remarked
that another principle of classification is presented by the different electric

systems used in them, which may be divided into two classes :

I. Idiostatic, that in which the whole electric force depends on the electri-

fication which is itself the si;bject of the test.
    II. Heterostatic, in which, besides the electrification to be tested, another

electrification maintained independently of it is taken advantage of.

    Thus, for example, the long-range electrometer (§§ 38, 39) is simply

idiostatic and is not adapted for heterostatic use ; but each of them may be

used idiostatically. The absolute electrometer was at first simply idiostatic
            ON STANDARDS OF ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE.  511

(§§ 17-21) ; more recently it has been used heterostatically, and is about to
acquire (§ 22) special organs adapted for beterostatic use ; as yet, bowever,
no species of tbe absolute electrometer promising permanence has come into

existence.

§ 41. It is instructive to trace tbe origin of various beterostatic species of

Aelectrometers by natiu-al selection.  body hanging, or otherwise symmetri-

cally balanced, in the middle of a symmetrical field offeree, but free to move

in one direction or the other in a line tangential to a line of force, moves in

one direction or the opposite when electrified positively or negatively.

Bohnenberger's arrangement of this kind has a convenient and approximately
constant field of force ; and his instrument was chosen in preference to others

which may have been equally sensitive, but were less convenient and constant,

and it became a permanent species.
    § 42. Bennet's gold-leaf electroscope, constructed with care to secure good

insulation, electrified sufficiently to produce a moderate divergence, has been

often used to test, by aid of this electrification, tbe quality of the electrifica-

tion of an electrified body brought into the neighbourhood of its upper pro-
jecting electrode, causing, if its electricity is of the same sign as that of tbe

gold leaves, increase of divergence ; if of the opposite sign, diminution. By

connecting the upper electrode with the inner coating of a Leyden jar with

internal artificially dried atmosphere, the charge of the gold leaves may be
made to last with little loss from day to day ; and by insulating Faraday's

metal cage (§ 2) round the gold leaves and alternately connecting it with
the earth and with a conductor whose difference of potentials from the earth

is to be tested, an increase or a diminution of divergence is observed accord-

ing as this difference is negative or positive, the gold leaves being positive.

Hence (through Peltier's and Delmann's forms) the beterostatic stationary and
portable repulsion electrometers, described in the Eoyal Institution Lecture
on "Atmospheric Electiicity " and in Nicbol's Cyclopaedia, article "Electricity,
Atmospheric," already referred to, of which one species stUl survives in

King's CoUege, Nova Scotia, and in the Natural Philosophy Class Eoom of

Edinburgh University. The same form of the beterostatic principle applied
to Snow Harris's attracted disk electrometer gave tbe portable and standard

electrometers described above.

  A§ 43. modification of Bohnenberger's electroscope, in which the two knobs

on the two sides of tbe banging gold leaf became transformed into halves of a
circular cylinder, with its axis horizontal and the gold leaf hung on a wire
insulated in a position coinciding with its axis, producing a species designed
for telegraphic purposes, but which did

not acquire permanence by natural se-
lection, and is only known to exist in

one fossil specimen. In this instrument
the wire bearing the gold leaf was con-
nected with a charged Leyden jar, and

the semicylinders with the bodies whose
difference of potential was to be tested.

But various modifications of the divi-

ded-cylinder or divided-ring class with

the axis vertical and plane of motion
horizontal have done some practical

work, and one species, the new quad-

rant electrometer (§ 6), promises to be-
come permanent.
512 REPORT--1867.

§ 44. The heterostatic principle in one form or other is essential to distin-

gnish between positive and negative. As remarked above (§ 42), the original

type of this use of it is to be found ia the old system of testing the quality

of the charge taken by the diverging straws or gold leaves of the electroscopes

used for the observation of atmospheric electricity ; which was done by

bringing a piece of rubbed sealing-wax into the neighbonrhood, and observ-

Aing whether this caused increase or diminution of the divergence.           donbt

which still exists as to the sign* of the atmospheric electricity observed by

Professor Piazzi Smyth on the Peak of Teneriffe, is owing to the imperfection

of this way of applying the principle. It is, indeed, to be donbted in any one

instance whether it is not vitreous electricity that the rubbed sealing-wax

acquires. And, again (§ 2), it is not certain that the glass case enclosing the
gold leaves, especially if very clean and surrounded by a very dry natural

atmosphere, screens them sufticiently from direct influence of the piece of

sealing-wax to make sure that the divergence due to vitreous electricity could

not be increased by the presence of the resinously electrified seahng-wax if

held nearer the gold leaves than the npper projecting stem.

§ 45. The heterostatic jn-inciple lias a very great advantage as regards

sensibility over any simple idiostatic arrangement, inasmuch as, for infinitely

small differences of potential to be measured, the force is as the squares of

the differences in any idiostatic arrangement, but is simply proportional to

the differences in every heterostatic arrana'cment.

VI. Determination of ilte Dynamical Equivalent of Heat from the thermal

Byeffects of Electric Currents.     J. P. Joule, D.C.L., F.B.S., 4'c.

   Sir W. Thomson, as long ago as 1851, showed that it was desirable to
make experiments such as arc the subject of the pi'esent paper. They have

necessarily been delayed until a sufficiently accurate method of measuring
resistance was discovered. Such a method having been described bj' Sir
William, and carried out into practice by Professor C. Maxwell and his able

coadjutors, the task assigned to me by the Committee of Electric Standards

was comparativeljr simj^le.

  My experiments were commenced nearly two years ago, and the apparent

ease with which they could be executed gave promise of their early com-

pletion. It was, however, found essential that careful observations of the

earth's horizontal magnetic intensity should be frequently made, and these

required the construction of apparatus whereby this element could be deter-         1

mined with acci;racy and rapidity.

The apparatus finally adopted for this purpose consists of a suspended

Ahorizontal flat coil of wire between two fixed similar coils.  current of

electricity can be made to traverse all three, communication with the sus-

pended coil being made by the suspending wires themselves according to Sir

"W. Thomson's plan. The sti-ength of a current is found by observing the
sum of the forces of attraction and repulsion by which the suspended coil is

urged. The strength of a current can in this manner be determined in ab-

solute measure. For the area of each of the three equal coils being called

a, the weight required to coimterpoise the force with which the suspended one

is urged w, the force of gravity g, and the length of wire in each of the coils

due to the distance between the fixed coils. In my instrument, in which

this distance is 1 inch, the diameter of the coils being 12 inches, and their

interior core 4 inches, this correction was proved by experiment to be -1185.

There was, however, considerable difficulty in obtaining an exact measure

of the distance between the fixed coils, and I therefore judged that the mea-

sure of the currents used in the experiments would be most accurately

obtained by means of a tangent galvanometer, the above described current-

meter being employed to determine the horizontal intensity.

 --This determination was efi'ected as follows : Many careful observations

of the horizontal intensity by an improved method on Gauss and Weber's

system were made alternatively vrith observations of the deflections of a
tangent galvanometer and the weighings of the current-meter when the

same currents travei'sed both instruments in succession. Then calling the ho-

rizontal intensity H, the angle of deflection d, and the weighing w, there was

= --ywobtained a constant c7^;^= -17676. Hence with these instruments

       H= ·17676 Vm'
                  tany

   The experiments for the determinations of horizontal intensity by the use
of this formula coidd be efi'ected in a few minutes, and did not require an
alteration in the disposition of any part of the apparatus. It was satisfac-
tory to find that, although the presence of masses of iron at only a few j'ards
distance made the field in which I worked considerably more intense than
that due to the latitude, and although I worked at diflferent times of the day,

the highest intensity, oiit of upwards of seventy observations distributed over

a year, was 3-6853, and the lowest 3-6607, indicating a much greater degree

of constancy than might have been expected.
   The galvanometer above mentioned was that employed in the thermal

experiments. It had a single circle of ^-inch copper wire, the diameter
of which, being measured in many places by a standard rule, gave a radius
of -62723 of a foot. The needle was half an inch long, and furnished with

a glass pointer traversing a divided circle of 6 inches diameter. In the experi-
ments the deflections were not far from 26° 34', the angle at which the influ-
ence of the length of the needle within certain hmits is inappreciable. It was

easy by a magnifler, arranged so as to avoid parallax, to read to one minute.
The torsion of the fibre gave only 3'-5 for an entire twist. The trifling cor-

rection thus required is applied to the recorded observations of deflection.

   The calorimeter first used was a copper vessel upwards of a gallon in
capacity, filled with distilled water. It had a conical lid, attached by screws,
in which were two tubulures, one for the introduction of a copper stirrer,
the other for the thermometer, around the immersed stem of wliich a wire of

platinum silver, having a resistance nearly equal to that of the Association
unit, was coiled.

   The resistance of the wire was found by comparing it with the Association
                                                                                   n /n n \

only with these and the unit and with the coil respectively. This, though

by no means so delicate a method as that of the Wheatstone balance im-

proved by Thomson, was able to give a final result certainly accurate to the

two-thousandth part. The results for the resistance of the coil in the first

series of experiments are as follow. They were obtained before and after

   The average resistance 1-01863 being reduced from the temperature 14"-5
Cent., at which the unit was adjusted, to 69°-9 Fahr., the average tempera-
ture of the calorimeter in the first series of experiments becomes 1-0191,
which, multiplied by 32808990, gives 33435640 as the resistance in British

absolute measure.

  A delicate thermometer was placed at a few inches distance from the

calorimeter, for the purpose of registering the temperature of the air. In

the Tables its indications are reduced to the scale of the instrument plunged

Ain the calorimeter.  string attached the handle of the stirrer to a stick, so

that the water could be effectually stirred without communicating the heat

Aof the hand.    wooden screen separated the observer from the apparatus.

In the experiments of the first series a battery of five large DanieU's cells,

arranged in series, transmitted the current through the coil for 40' exactly

determined by chronometer. During this time twenty-eight observations of

deflection were obtained, seven at each end of the pointer directed N.E. and

S.W., and seven when it was directed N. W. and S.E. by reversing the current

in the galvanometer for the latter half of the time. The water was stirred

twenty-eight times. Its temperature was taken at the beginning, middle,

and end of an experiment. There were also fourteen observations of the

temperature of the air.
    Immediately after each experiment the horizontal intensity of magnetic

force was obtained by observing the deflection of the galvanometer and the
weighing of the current-meter produced by the same current.

   Before and after each experiment, two others were made in precisely the
same manner, but excepting the current, in order to discover the influence of

radiation and the conducting-power of the atmosphere.

    It appeared to he desirable to diminish the atmospheric influence ; I

therefore commenced a second series, in -which the calorimeter was covered
with two folds of cotton wadding. The bulb of the air-registering themio-
meter was also placed in a small bag made of the same material. In this
fresh series each experiment occupied one hour, as I had learned by experi-

ence that -with my battery arrangement the current would be sufficiently

uniform. In fact the highest reading in an experiment was not more than
J(^ higher than the lowest. There were, evenly distributed through the
hour, forty observations of deflection, twenty of the air, and three of the

water-thermometer ; and the water was stirred forty times. Two minutes

were allowed for the complete equalization of temperature previous to the
final thermometer reading. The experiments on radiation were also similarly

extended.

   The coil was the same as that used in the first series. It had a coat of
shellac vanish. Five determinations of its resistance were made, using a
single Dauiell's cell with various resistances included in the circuit. The
galvanometer had a coil 17 inches in diameter consisting of nine turns. The
results are as foUow :

the calorimeter and air-registering thermometer so corrected, equal to 10-822,

gives the unit effect on the former.

   Hence the corrected indication of the air-thermometer in the second series
of thermal experiments will be 349-63-l-1835=348-4465. This being
12-5345 in excess of the temperature of the calorimeter, the corrected

                                                        12-534.5

distiUed water, copper as water 2501, thermometer and coil as water 80,
and cotton-wool as water 200 grs., giving a total of 98342 grains.

   The equivalents obtained in the two foregoing series of experiments are
as much as one-fiftieth in excess of the equivalent I obtained in 1849 by
agitating water. I therefore instituted a strict inquiry with a view to
discover any causes of error, so that they might be avoided in a fresh series.
The most probable source of error seemed to be insuificient stirring of the
water of the calorimeter. Although agitated so frequently as forty times in
the hour, there could be no doubt that, during any intervals of comparative
rest, a current of heated water would ascend from the coil, and that if a thin
stratum of it remained any time at the top, some loss of heat would result.
I resolved therefore to use a fresh calorimeter, and to introduce into it a
stirrer which could bo kept in constant motion by clockwork.

   Another source of error which, though it would be finally eliminated by
frequent repetition of the experiments, it seemed to be desirable to avoid,
was the hygrometric quality of the cotton-wool which enveloped the calori-
meter in the second series of experiments. I therefore sought for a material
which did not present that inconvenience. The plan finally adopted was to
cover the calorimeter first with tinfoil, to place over that two layers of silk

net (tuUe), and to finish with a second envelope of tinfoil.

  A third source of possible error was the circumstance that the silver-

platinum alloy, when made positively electrical in distilled water, is slowly

acted upon, an oxide of silver as a bluish-white cloud aiising from the metal,

while hydrogen escapes from the negative electrode. On this account the

coil in the experiments of the last series, as well as the subsequent, was well
varnished. But it was found at the conclusion of the experiments that the
varnish had in a great measure lost its protecting power. This circumstance

gave me considerable anxiety : I was, however, ultimately able, by the fol-

lowing facts arrived at after the thermal experiments were completed, to
satisfy myself that no perceptible influence had been produced by it on the

results :

    1st. The resistance of the coils, after long-continued use had deteriorated
the varnish, was not sensibly less than it was after they had been freshly

varnished.

   2nd. The coil of the 3rd series was, in the unprotected state, immersed
in distilled water, and compared with many hundred yards of thick copper wire,
unimmersed, having nearly equal resistance. The result showed that the
resistance to the current was sensibly the same whether a single cell or five
cells of Daniell in a series were used. Now, had any considerable leakage
by electrolytic action taken place, it would have been very much less in pro-

portion in the former than in the latter instance.

   3rd. When the coils of the second and third series, in the unprotected state,

were placed in distilled water, and made the electrodes of a battery of five
cells, the deflection was 40' of a degree on a galvanometer with a coil of
17 inches diameter composed of 18 turns of wire. This deflection indicates
a current of about -^^ of the average current in the thermal experiments.
In this case the chemical action was distinctly visible, but quite ceased to be
so when the electrodes were connected by a wire of unit resistance, so as to

reduce the potential to that in the thermal experiments.
    4th. The coil of No. 2 series being used as a standard, that of No. 3

series, in the unprotected condition, was immersed, first in water, then in
oil. The resistance to the current of five DanieU's cells was found to be

sensibly equal in the two cases.
   Hence there could be no doubt that the loss of heat during the experi-

ments by electrolytic action could not possibly in any instance have been so
great as one-thousandth of the entire efi'ect, and was probably not one
quarter of that small quantity ; whilst in the larger number of experiments,

when the varnish was fresh, it must have been nil.
   The coil used in the third series of experiments was made by bending

four yards of platinum-silver wire double, and then coihng it into a spiral
which was supported and kept in shape by beiag tied with silk thread to a
thin glass tube. ' The terminals were thick copper wires, and the whole was
coated with shellac and mastic varnish. The following results were ob-
tained for its resistance. In the first three trials the current was measured
by a galvanometer with a circle of nine turns 17 inches diameter, and in the
last six with an instrument with eighteen turns of wire. In the first six

there was an extra unit of resistance included in the circuit :

   The above average resistance, reduced to 18°-63 C, the mean temperature

in the third series, is -98953 of the Association unit, or in British measure

   In the third series, the experiments for the heat of the current, of radia-

tion, and for horizontal magnetic intensity were alternated in such a manner
that each class occupied the same portions of the day that the others did. I
sought in this way to avoid the effects of any horary change in the humidity
&c. of the atmosphere, or in the magnetic force. Of the thirty experiments
comprising each class, six were performed at about each of the several hours,
11 A.M., 12| P.M., 1| P.M., 4 P.M., and 5| p.m.

   The calorimeter, protected as already described, was supported on the
edges of a light wooden frame. It was carefully guarded against draughts
by screens coated with tinfoil placed at a foot distance. The stirrer con-
sisted of a vertical copper rod, to which vanes, on the plan of a screw-
propeUer, were soldered at four equidistant places. The rod extended
2 inches above the calorimeter, and was there affixed to a light wooden shaft
2 feet long, attached at the upper end to the last spindle of a train of clock-
wheels. The weight was 35 lbs., which, falling about 2 feet per hour, pro-
duced a continuous revolution of the stirrer at a rate of about 200 in the
minute. The action of the stirrer left nothing to be desired. It was started
five minutes before an experiment commenced, and kept going until the last
observation of the thermometer had been made.

   The experiments, as in the second series, lasted one hour, during which
were made eight observations of the thermometer immersed in the calori-
meter, twenty of the temperature of the air, and forty of the deflection of the

galvanometer.

       Address ly the President, Sir W. Thomson, LL.D., F.B.S.

The progress of mathematical and physical science dm-iug the past year will be

better represented bj- the valuable reports to be laid before this Section, and the

lines of thought which hare originated since the British Association last met will

be better illustrated by the papers and discussions which will constitute our or-

dinary daily work, than by any statement which I could liave prepared. It was

therefore my intention not to detain yoii from the interesting subjects and abundant

matter for discussion which will so fully occupy our time during the Meeting, by

an introductory address. But I must ask you to bear with me if I modify some-

what this resolution in consec|uence of a recent event which, I am sure, must touch

very neerly the hearts of all present, and of very many in all parts of the world, to
whom the name of Faraday has become a household word for all that is admirable

in scientific genius. Having had so short a time for preparation, I shall not attempt

at present any accormt of Faraday's discoveries and philosophy. But, indeed, it

is very unnecessary that I should speak of what he has done for science. All that

lives for us still, and parts of it we shall meet at every turn through our work in

this Section. I wish I coidd put into words something of the image which the

name of Faraday always suggests to my mind. Kindliness and unselfishness of

disposition ; clearness and singleness of purpose ; brevity, simplicity, and direct-

sympathy with his  audience                                                                                          and  good
--ness ;                     or his  friend                          perfect  natural                          tact

taste ; thorough cultivation : all these he had, each to a rare degi'ee ; and their

influence pervaded his language and manner, whether in conversation or lecture.

But all these combined, made only a part of Faraday's cliarm. lie had an inde-

scribable quality of quiclmess and life. Something of the light of his genius irra-

diated his presence with a certain bright intelligence, and gave a singidar charm

to his manner, which was surely felt by every one, from the deepest philosopher

--to the simplest child, who ever had the privilege of seeing him in his home the

Eoyal Institution. That light is now gone from us. "While thankful for having seen

and felt it, we cannot but moiun our loss, and feel that whatever good things,

whatever brightness may be yet in store for us, that light we can never see again.

--lieved, ever attempted as connected with science or literature. Sir Daiid then read

the following notes : 1. The correspondence -was founded on the assumption that
Newton was a precocious genius, having wiitteu on the Infinitesimal Calculus &c.
at the age of eleven, whereas he was then at school and knew nothing of mathe-
matics, occupying himself onlj'- with waterwheels, -svindmills, waterclocks, and other
boyish amusements. 2. There is no evidence that Pascal and Newton had any
correspondence. Having examined the whole of Newton's papers in the possession
of the Earl of Portsmouth, I never found any letter or paper in which Pascal is
mentioned. 3. The letters from 3Iiss Hannah Ai/sco>ir/h, Newton's mother, hear

this sig-nature, although at the time they were ^vlitten she was a married woman
and should ha>'e signed Hannah Smith. 4. The letters of Pascal have been found

by M. Faugere to be in another hand, and the signature not that of Pascal. 5. The

letters and signatures of Newton are not in his hand. 6. An experiment with

coffee is mentioned in one of the letters of Pascal, whereas coffee was at that time
unknown in France. 7. All Newton's letters are in French, a language in v,'hich he
never wi-ote. His letters to the celebrated French mathematician, Varignon, are in
Latin, and Newton himself has stated that he could not read French without a
dictionary. 8. The style and sentiments in Newton's letters are such as he never

could have used. He expresses eternal gratitude to Pascal, a word which no
Enghshman would have employed. 9. According to the correspondence, M.

DesmaizeaUx got access to Newton's papers after his death, and carried off" a great

many of them. Now it is certain that ^Ir. Conduitt, Newton's nephew, arranged

and examined all Newton's papers after his death in order to obtain raaterials for
a Hfe of him, and, having failed to find a competent person to write it, he under-
took it himself, and obtained from persons then alive all the information that
existed respecting Newton'.s early life and studies. All this information, which 1

have used in my Ufe of Newton, stands in direct contradiction to the assumption of

Newton's precocity and early connexion with Pascal, which is the basis of the

correspondence now exciting so general an interest. There can be no doubt, there-
fore, that the letters of Newton and Pascal are audacious and elaborate forgerie.?,

On the alleged Corvespondence hetween Newton and Pascal reccntli/ communi-
   cated to the French Academy. By T. Archer Hirst, F.B.S., F.li.A.S.

The autlior stated that the alleged correspondence between Newton and Pascal,

recently communicated to the French Academy by tlie eminent geometer and his-

torian Michel Chasles, had taken the scientific world by surprise. If genuine, it

would follow that it is to Pascal and not to Newton that we are indebted for the

development of the theoiy of gra\'itation ; that Newton borrowed his ideas from

Pascal, and, what is worse, basely concealed and tried to cancel all traces of liis

having thus borrowed. Charges so grave as these could not for a moment be

entertained by Englishmen, were they not put fji-ward by one vvhosc authority is

acknowledged, and whose rectitude of character is beyond suspicion.

The real history of these documents appeared to be unknown to their present

owner, nor was M. Chasles at liberty even to state by ^\-hom they were consigned

Weto him.  were deprived, therefore, of tlie most direct way of testing their

authenticity, and must linve recourse to examination of the documents themselves.

With a view of enabling us to do so, M. Chasles had kindly sent to Sir David

Brewster and to the author of the present communication several specimens, in

French, of Newton's handwriting, all which had at once been pronounced to be

forgeries by the eminent biographer of Newton.

    .\fter drawing attention to several inconsistencies contained in the letters already
published by Chasles and purporting to be from Pascal, Newton, lioyle, Aubrey,

and others, the author stated that the question of authenticity could only be con-
clusively decided by a careful comparison of the docinnents witli the autlientic pa-

pers of Newton now in the possession of Lord Portsmouth, the Earl of Macclesfield,
the Royal Society, and Trinity College, Cambridge. This comparison would be
much facilitated, and, indeed, scientific literature greatly enriched, if tlie owners of

Oil the Inverse ProJ^lem of Co resolvents. By the Hon. J. Cocele, M.A., F.E-./S.

               Communicated hij the Eov. Professor 11. Haklet, F.R.S.

Inverse problems, as is well known, present greater difficulties than direct ones.

For instance, while it is easj' to square a niunber, it is not so easy to extract its

square root. Moreover, there are cases in which it is impossible to obtain a finite so-

lution of an inverse problem. The solution of a quintic is usually considered to be

such a case. In the theory of coresolvents it is comparatively easy to pass from

the algebraical to the differential resolvent, but the converse does not hold. The

finite integration of the linear diil'erential resolvent of a given algebraical equation

would, perhaps, be a step towards the general solution of the inverse problem.

But that integration has not yet been effected, except in two or three special cases

and the definite integrals of Boole have not, that I am aware of, been converted into

indefinite ones. In order to take the step abo\-e pointed to, it seems to me neces-

--sary to have recourse to a non-linear differential resolvent, to be constructed as

follows: The elements of the final non-lineav are three; the first is (l)the second

differential coefBcient of the dependent variable ; the second is (2) the first

differential coefficient of that variable ; the third is (.3) the square of the second

element divided by the dependent variable itself. The sinister of the non-linear

resolvent is constituted by the six homogeneous quadratic products of the three

elements, and is the sum of those six products, each multiplied into an indeter-

minate or conditional multiplier. Each element and each product is, as we know

by the theory of coresolvents, in general capable of being expressed as a rational

and integi'al function of the dependent variable, of a degree less by one than that of

the given algebraic equation. Suppose this last equation to be a quartic, then

each product, and consequently the dexter of the non-linear resolvent, can be ex-

pressed as a culjic function of the dependent variahl(>. Let the dexter of the non-

linear be reduced to zero by causing the several coefficients of the cube, the square

and the first power of the dependent variable, and also the absolute term, to vanish

separately. These four conditions, while they reduce the dexter of the non-linear

to zero, enable us to eliminate four of the indeterminate multipliers from its sinister.

No elevation of degree will arise from the elimination, for all these four condi-

tions are linear. The coefficients of the six homogeneous quadratic products on
the sinister will now in general be homogeneous linear functions of the two un-

eiiminated, indeterminate multipliers ; and, by the solution of a culjic only, the

the ratio of these two multipliers can be so assigned as to cause the sinister to break

up into linear factors, each factor being a linear and homogeneous function of tho

three elements. If we ajjply the exponential substitution to either of these factors

equated to zero, the resulting final non-linear difl'erential equations of the first

Weorder are of a soluble form.  have thus constructed a soluble non-linear

differential resolvent of a general biquadratic. For a cubic we might dispense

with one of the homogeneous products, and consequently v,-ith one of the indeter-

minate multipliers ;  but we should thus be led to  a resulting cubic                                                                and it will be

Webetter to retain tho whole six terms of the sinister.  shall then, having only

three conditions of evanescence to satisfy on the dexter, be able to break up the

sinister into linear factors, as before, by means of a homogeneous cidjic in the three

remaining disposable indeterminate nmltipliers. Applying to this last cubic the

method of vanishing groups, we see that its solution depends upon the solution

of a quadratic equation and the extraction of a cube root only. In the case of a

quartic, the integral obt.ained by the foregoing processes involves two arbitrary

constants onlv, and its nature and extent require further discussion. But it seems

                                                                                                                                     1*

algebraic equations up to the fourth degree inclusive ; and although the above
discussion does not embrace equations whose degrees exceed four, it apparently

indicates that further residts may spring from the study of non-linear differential

resolvents,

  On a certain Cyclical SymhoL By the Rev. Professor E. Hakley, F.B.S.

   The object of this paper was to explain the meaning and use of a certain symbol
which the author had employed -with advantage in dealing with circular* algebraic
functions. Some years ago, while engaged on the theory of quintics, the author
found that in the transformation and gener.al treatment of the higher equations
circular functions occupy a conspicuous place, and i^lay an all-important part ; and
the author was led, by aii attentive consideration of the structure of such functions,
to demise a calcidus, whereby operations upon them might be materially abridged.
The author had since found that his invention had been to some extent anticipated
by Vandermonde, in a Memoir on the Resolution of Equations, published by the
French Academy in 1771. The author explained the difference between Vander-
monde's process and his O'mi, and showed how he had succeeded lately in enlarging
the powers of the latter. Examples were given to illustrate the value of the new
symbol, not only as an abridged notation, but also, what was more important, as a
working instrument or process.

    This paper contains rules for use in meclianical drawing', founded on the prin-
ciple, that if a straight line and an indefinite number of circles in one plane touch
each other at one point, the curve which cuts oif parts of a given uniform length
from the straiglit tangent and from all the circles, approximates, in the neighbour-
hood of the place where it cuts the straight tangent, very closely to a circular arc

"whose radius is three-fourths of the given uniform length. The arcs laid otf
according to the rules are somewhat longer than the exact length ; but in an arc
subtending 3CF the error is only tts o^ P^i"'' o^ ^^^ length of the arc ; and it varies
nearly as the fourth power of the angle subtended by the arc.

     Preparations for Observing the Total Solar Eclipse of August 18, 1868.

          By Major J. F. TexXxaxt, R.E., F.B.A.S., F.R.G.S., F.M.S.

   In January last I drew the attention of the Royal Astronomical Society to the
Total Eclipse of 1868, August 18, which will be visible in India, and in the March
Number of the ' Notices' of the Society will be found a paper in which I proposed
that the Government of India should be solicited to make arrangements for maldng
use of this very favourable opportunity for examining the prominences.

   I am happy to say that, at the suggestion of tlie Astronomer Royal, the Secretary

of State for India has sanctioned the preparation of an ec[uipment, and I propose in
this note to mention what is in progress.

   First. It is intended to photogi-aph the appearances of the total phase. For
this purpose a 9 j-inch " silver-on-glass" reflector, equatoiially mounted and driven
by clockwork, is being prepared. The photographs will be taken in the focus of
the speculum, and it is estimated that the exposure to produce an image of the
prominences will not exceed half a second. Provision is being made for a consi-

derable field, in order that, if possible, some record may be obtained of the struc-

ture of the corona.

   Secondly. It is proposed to examine, as well as may be, the spectra of the pro-

minences and corona. For this, one of the old collimators of the Greenwich Transit
Circle has been kindly lent by the Astronomer Royal. It is being equatorially
mounted in a rough way, and Avill be provided with a spectroscope permitting the
observations to be referred to the lines of the solar spectrum.

   Lastly. The Astronomer Royal has lent a -ii-iuch telescope, moimted firmly, to
which is being adapted an ej'epiece for examining the state of polarization of the

lights of the prominences and corona. An an-augemeut is being made by which
one test may be rapidly changed for another, and it is hoped that in this way a

more satisfactory result will be obtained than by any single test.
   1 trust that all the instruments will be in India early in next year, and that they

will be in position in time to allow experiments to be made, so as to secure tho
success of the photogi-aphic operations.

                              On the Colours of the Soap-Biilhle.
                 By Sir Datid Bkewstee, K.H., LL.D., F.B.S., 4'c.

   The colours of the soap-bubble have been the subject of frequent obsenntiou
since the time of Boyle, Hook, and Newton, and they have been invariably ascribed
" not to any colour' in the medium itself in which they are formed, or on whose
surfaces they appear, but solely to its greater or less thickness." The author of
this paper had been led to doubt the correctness of this opinion, and while re-
peating the beautiful experiments of Professor Plateau " On the EquiUbrium of
Liquid Films," he was led to discover the true cause of these colours, whether they
are observed on the soap-bubble or on plane, convex, and concave fihus sti-etched
across the mouths of closed or open vessels.

   The paper, which is illustrated with numerous coloured drawings, is divided into

five parts.

   1. On the phenomena of colour in a vertical plane film.
   2. On the production of revolving systems of coloured rings on the soap-film.
   3. On the form and movements of the bands and rings on con-\-ex and concave

films.

   4. On the phenomena prodiiced by different solutions.
   5. On the origin and development of the colours of the soap-bubble.

    In these sections the author has sliONvn that the colouring-matter of the soap-
bubble is secreted from the soap-solution v.-hen reduced to the state of a film
that it rises to the highest point of the film in colourless portions, in the form of
tadpoles, which pass into molecules in every possible order of colour, and then take

their proper place in the coloui-ed bands ; that these bauds move over the surface
of the film under the influence of gravity, and may be blown into fragments or into
molecules of all colours, or e^-en recombined with the fihn ; that they may be blo-^m
into two systems of coloured i-ings, the one revohing from light to left, and the

 other froni left to right ; and that under the the influence of the centrifugal force,

--these molecules are carried into their place in Ne^\i;on's scale those of the first

 orders going to the centre of the ringp, and followed by those of higher orders that

happen to be in the film, when it is blown upon through a tube in the direction of

a diameter.
    " It is impossible," the author adds, " to convey in language an adequate idea of

the molecular movements, and the brilliant chromatic phenomena exhibited on the
 soap-films, and it is equally impossible for art to delineate them. The ^-isible secre-
 tion of a colourless fluid from a film less than the twelve thousandth of an inch in

-- --thickness, its se])aration into portions of every possible colour, the quick passage
--of these portions into bands of the different orders in Newton's scale, their ever

 vaiTing forms and hues when the bands either break up spontaneously, or are

--forcibly broken up, their conversion into revolving systems of coloured rings under
--the influence of a centrifugal force, their various motions when the film is at rest,
--and protected from aerial currents, their recombination into a colourless fluid

when driven to the centre or margin of concave and convex films, and their reab-
 sorption by the film by means of mechanical diffusion, are facts constituting a
 system of visible molecular actions, of which we have no example, and nothing

 even approaching to it in Physics."

                      On the Figures of Equilibriian of Liquid Films.
                 By Sir David Beeavsteb, K.H., LL.D., F.E.S., 4'c.

    In repeating some of the experiments of Professor Plateau, described in seven
 interesting memoirs published in the Transactions of the Belgian Academ}-, and
 in prosecuting his own experiments on the colours of the soap-bublile, the author

 of this paper observed several new phenomena which may have escaped the notice

 of the Belgian philosopher.
     Professor Plateau has described and dra"svn the beautiful systems of soap-films,

 obtained by lifting from a soap-solution a cube made of wires about one ana a half
 inch long. This system is a polyhedron, composed of twelve similar films stretch-

ing- from the wires, and united to a plane quadrangular film in the centre. When

this vertical film was blown upon, M. Von Rees observed that it was reduced to

a line, and then reproduced in a horizontal position, from which it could be blown

again into a ^ertical position.

   If wo suppose the quadrangular film removed, and all the twelve films radiating

from the centre of the cube. Professor Plateau found that such a system could not
be kept in equilibrium, unless there was something solid in the central point, such

as the end of a wire or a drop of fluid.
   In repeating these experiments the author found that, after converting the hori-

zontal into the vertical quadrangular film, and continuing the blowang, he produced
the radial sj-stem of films, which in an instant returned to the system with a ver-
tical film, and then into the system with the horizontal film.

   M. Von Kees had foimd that, by immersing the wire cube with the normal poly-

hedron a few millimetres in the soap -solution, the film formed on its lower face,
imprisoned the air in the quadrangidar pyramid above it, and that this air rose to

the centre of the cube, and replaced the quadrangular plane with a hollow cube

with curved faces.

    In this beautiful experiment the hollow cube is invariable in size, being neces-

sarily equal in its contents to one-fourth part of the -ss-ire cube. The author of the
present paper discovered a method of inserting a hollow cube of any magnitude in
the centre of the polyhedron. This was done by blowing a bubble of the requisite

.size, and introducing it within the wire cube. He succeeded also by this means in
inserting a second hollow cube beside the first, the side common to both being
plane wlien the two cubes were equal, convex when the one was less, and concave
when it was greater than the other. In such a system, which is in perfect equili-
brium, the number of films is niiiehvii. He found also that two hollow solid figures

could, Ijy the same means, be inserted in the other systems of films which Professor
Plateau had discovered in a wire tetrahedron, or a quadrangidar pj^amid, or a
regular octahedron, or a rectangular prism, or in a system obtained from two rectan-

gidar planes fixed at right angles to each other.
   This last and interesting system consists of four cm-ved films extending from each

vertical wire, and connected with an elliptical film in the common section of the
rectangles. The major axis of this film is four times greater than its minor axis,

and it is placed in the angle, which is a little greater than 90°, but sometimes also

in the other angle.

   By making this system of wires moveable, so that the rectangular planes can pass
froni'DO^to 180=, the author obtained some singular results. As the angle increased
from 90°, the minor axis of the elliptical film increased, till when it approached to

180° it was nearly circular, appropriating gradually the fluid of the four curved

films attached to the wires.

   By again diminishing this angle the almost circular film became more and more

elliptical, till it reached its normal state at 90°, giving back to the curved films the
fluid which formed them. If the angle of the rectangular plane which contains
the elliptical film is diminished, the film will grow more elliptical, and at 45° will

become a straigU line, giving up its fluid to the other four iilms. At this instant

the whole system changes, the oval film being reproduced in the angle of 135° !
    Remarkable as this phenomenon is, there is one still more remarkable, which

requires the testimony of the eye to make it credible. If when tlie rectangles are
inclined 90° we blow upon the elliptical film a bubble of such a size as to replace

the system of films with a hollow curvilineal cube, and wait till it bursts, the si/4cm
of liquid Jilms u'hich it c.vpelled vill reappear, as if it had left its (/host behind it to
recorer the elements ichich the luhble had appropriated !

   By uniting the upper and lower ends of all the wires in this system, and also by

uniting tlie wires at various points in their length, the author obtained a number
of beautiful and complex systems of films, which require numerous diagrams to
make them intelligible.

    After treating of the equilibrium of liquid films, as seen in the union of spherical
bubbles and other hollow solids, the author considers the formation of plaue,_ con-
vex, and conca^-e films upon the mouths of open and closed vessels of different
shapes, and their deposition on the same vessels from bubbles ; and he describes

are formed upon conical vessels open at both ends.

Notice respecting the Enamel Pliotocjraphs executed hi/ Mr. M'Sau', of Elin-

           hurgli. By Sir David Brewster, K.H., LL.D., F.R.S., 4'e-

   In order to give permanence to photographs, various attempts have been made to
burn theln into glass or porcelain. M. Joubert and M. Lafon-Camersac some
time ag;o produced very fine pictures by this process ; and more recently, M. Ober-
metter and M. Grune, of Berlin, have been ec[ually successful. Oiu- coimtiTman,

Mr. "SVilliam M'liaw, has also succeeded in obtaining very excellent pictures, which
v\ill bear comparison witli those produced by the best foreign artists, and he has

requested me to exhibit specimens to the Section. ]\L-. M'Eaw believes that his

process is similar to that of Camersac, which is kept secret, and he claims no other
merit than that of being the first Britisli artist who has succeeded, in this branch
of photography. His pictures are produced in any enamel colour, and although,
before they are fired, they can be rubbed off like daguerreotype, yet the burning
lixes them immoveably, while the fusion of the picture gives it "its characteristic

transparencj-. From some experiments which he has abeady made, Mr. M'Raw is
sanguine that the pictures may not only be produced in monochrome, but that they
may be simply tinted and finished with the various colours biu-ned in. Althouo-h

the specimens are chiefly on glass, yet they can be transferred to any surface or sul)-

stance that will stand the firing, such as enamelled copper articles of porcelain.

On the Motions and Colours upon Films of Alcohol, Volatile Oils, and other
              Fluids. By Sir David Breavster, K.H., F.E.S., ^-c.

In a paper " On the Phenomena of thin Plates exposed to Polarized Light,"

pubhshed in the Philosophical Transactions for 1841, tlie autlior observed certain

motions and colours upon some of the volatile and fixed oils, the cause of which he

did not attempt to discover. Their apparent similarity to the molecidar movements

and colours, described in a preceding paper, induced him to resume the subject.

 When      a   drop of alcohol  is  placed  upon  an  aperture  the  fifth    of an  inch           in

_

diameter or less, a concave lens will be formed upon it. As the alcohol evaporates,

a very small plane film will appear- in the centre, and will gradually increase till it

fills the aperture. If held in a vertical or even inclined position, and examined by

ti-ansnutted Ught, a current of fluid, without colour, A\ill be seen issuing from the

margin of the film, moving quickly to difi'erent parts of its circumference, some-

times dividing itself into two currents dancing opposite one another, and then ex-

tending into secondary currents in constant motion. Similar currents are produced

upon various alcoholic .solutions and a large number (seventy to eighty) of volatile

oils, &c.

If we now examine the film by reflected Hght, the principal and secondaiy cur-

rents will be seen as before, but accompanied with systems of coloured rings of

gi-eat beauty, shifting their place on the film, sometime^ in rotation, expanding^and

contracting quickly, and changing their form and colour.

   In small films there is often only one system of rings contracting and expanding
with a constant variation of the central tint. In general, however, there are two,

three, or several systems--each system being produced by a secondaiy current

giving morion to the colouring-matter on .the surface of the film. In some cases

the motions and colours disappear, the film becomes coloiuless, and tadpoles issue
from its margin as on the soap-bubble ; but in general the film bursts before this
talces place. The colourless currents and the colours into wliicli they expand are
supposed by the author to have the same origin as those upon the soap-bubble. The
paper was illustrated by drawings of the currents and of the systems of rin"-s.

ABspectrum of the small circular image S, and      the spectrum of the radiation, the

centre of which is beyond the violet, and nearly in the place where the intensity

of the chemical or invisible rays is a maximum.

   In order to analyze this compoimd radiation, let the image of the sun S, fig. 1,

be taken from homogeneous red light R, fig. 3, and refracted by the prism, and we

shall have its radiation nb at a little distance from the bright portion R, as in fig. 3.

In homogeneous yellow light (Y, fig. 4) the radiation ab will be at a greater distance

yfrom than in the red light. In homogeneous riolet light (V, fig. 5) the radiation

Vah will be at a greater distance from than in the yellow light.

If we now refract laterally these homogeneous radiant spectra, fig. 3 will be

changed into fig. 6, fig. 4 into fig. 7, and fig. 5 into fig. 8, thus proving that the

RYradiant portion of the spectra consists of rays more refrangible than the portion

Vand from which it is derived, and that the difference between the refractive in-
RYdices of these portions increases with the refrangibility of the r.ays .at
                                                                              and V.

The compound spectrum MN, AB, fig. 2, is therefore composed of all these sepa-

rate spectra, and if we refract it laterally, as shown in wefig. 9, produce the

oblique radiant spectrum M'N'A'B', thus proving that the radiant image consists

of rays more refrangible than the homogeneous light from ^^hicll it is derived.

In a rude experiment with a prism of flint glass, whose mean index of refraction

w^as 1'596, the index of the extreme violet was 1-ClO, .and that of the centre of the

radiant image l'()40.

In the preceding experiments the radiation is produced by the action, on the

retina, of the small and bright image of the sim ; but the same results are obtained,
and more distinctly exhibited, by placing a surface of finely ground glass either on

the front of the prism, or behind it, and near the eye.

The existence of a radiant image beyond the violet end of the spectrum, as in

--fig. 2, is a fact difiicult to explain. I have had an opportunity of describing, or

showing it to several distinguished philosophers to the Marquis Laplace and M.

Biot in the autumn of 1814, and more recently to others, by some of whom the

experiments have been repeated, but no explanation of them has been suggested,

excepting the untenable one that the separation of the radiant image from the

ordinai-y spectrum might be the result of parallax.

  A better theoiy, and one of great interest, if true, may be sought in the pheno-

mena of fluorescence, discovered in sulphate of quinine by Sir John Ilerschel, and

in fluor spar and other substances by myself, and in the beautiful explanation of

them by Professor Stokes. In this theory the ijivisible radiation of the chemical

rays is rendered visible by being scattered by gTanular surfaces, just as the invisible

chemical rays in the ordinary specti'um are rendered visible by being reflected and

scattered by the particles of fluorescent bodies.

    On a Real Image Stereoscox^. By J. Clerk Maxavbll, M.A., F.li.S.

   In all stereoscopes there is an optical arrangement, by wliicli the right eye sees
an image of one picture and the left eye that of another. These images ought to
he apparently in the same place, and at the distance of most distinct vision. In
ordinaiy stereoscopes these bnages are virtual, and the observer has to place his
two eyes near two apertures, and he sees the united images, as it were, behind the
optical apparatus. In the stereoscope made for the author by Messrs. Elliott
Brothers the observer stands at a short distance from the apparatus, and looks with
both eyes at a large lens, and the image appears a's a real object close to the lens.
The stereoscope consists of a board about 2 feet long, on which is placed, first, a
vertical frame to hold the pair of pietiu'es, which may be an ordinary stereoscopic
sHde, turned upside down ; secondly, a sliding piece near the middle of the board
containing two lenses of G inches focal length, placed side by side, with their centres
about 1] inch apart; and thirdly, a frame containing a large lens of about 8
inches focal length and 3 inches"^ diameter. The observer stands with his e^-es
about 2 feet from the large lens. With his right eye he sees the real image of the

left-hand picture formed' by the left-hand lens iu'the air, close to the large lens,
and -svith the left eye he sees the real image of the other picture fornaed by the
other lens in the same place. The united images look like a real object in the air,

close to the large lens. This image may be magnified or diminished at plea.?ure by

sliding the piece containing the two lenses nearer to, or fmiher from, the pictures.

   the Radiant and Absorptive Properties of Vapour in the Atmosphere. By

    R. ErssELL.

   After refen-ing to the importance of Trof. Tyndall's researches on heat as a mode of
motion, the author took exception to some of his deductions on the influence which

the vapour of water exerts in modifying the intensity of solar and ten'estrial radia-
tion. The author stated that he 'had come to the conclusion that the radiant
powers of the vapour of water in the atmosphere were not even capable of forming
clouds, though they might be capable of forming mists in valleys. In our atmo-
sphere he believed that the vapoiu- of water has little power of transmitting its

heat into space when it approaches or reaches the dew-point, and that if any cloud
had been caused by the radiation of heat into space, its upper sm-face would be flat,
like the mists in the meadows before sunrise. These and other reasons led him to

the conclusion that the radiation of vapours into space has, directly, a veiy slight

influence on the production of rain.

On a Neiv Telegraphic Thermometer, and on the AppUeation of the Principle
   of its construction to other Meteorological Indicators. By C. Wheatstone,

    F.R.S., n.C.L., LL.D., cjc

   The telegi-aphic thermometer which I constructed in 1843, and which is de-
scribed in the Report of the Tldrteenth Meeting of the British Association, depended
on the simultaneous action of two isochronous chronometer or cloclc movements
 one at the remote statiou regulating the motion of a plunger in the bore of a ther-
mometer, and the other at the near or observing station, marking, by the motion
of the needle of a galvanometer, the moment at which the contact of the plunger
with the mercury of the distant thermometer completed or broke the circuit. The
 clock movements required to be periodically wound up, and therefore the aflected

 instnuuent could not be left to itself for an indefinite time.

    There are, however, many situations in which it might be desirable to have
 moteorologic indications when the instruments would not be accessible for very
12 REPORT 1867.

long periods. I liave therefore de-\-ised a new class of telegraphic meteorometers
wliich shall be independent of clockwork, and may remain in any situation of diffi-

cult access as long as the instrument endures. This principle is applicable to all in-

struments which indicate by means of a revolving hand, and I have already devised

its application to a Breguet's metallic thermometer, an aneroid barometer, and an

hygrometer, depending on the absorption of moisture by a thin membrane. It is also

applicable to a bar-magnet in a fixed position, and to a variety of other indicators.

The apparatus consists of two distinct instruments, connected only by telegraphic

wires : the first I will call the questioner (A) ; the second, the responder (B).
   The questioner (A) is a rectangular box presenting externally a circular dial face,

round which are engraved the degrees both of the Fahrenheit and Centigrade ther-
mometric scales : the former ranging from 20° below zero F. to 220° above that
point, and the latter from 0"" to 110° C. It shows besides three binding screws for

the pm-pose of connecting the telegraphic wires, and a handle which causes the

rotation of the armature of a magnetomotor in the interior. This magnetomotor

myis similar in its construction to that emjiloj-ed in  alphabetic magnetic tele-

graph ; a soft iron armatui-e rotating before the four poles of the magnet occasions,
when the circuit is completed, alternate currents of equal intensity. The box also

contains a small electromagnet which acts bv means of mechanism similar to that

employed in the indicator of the aforesaid telegraph, and causes the revolution of

the index of the dial.

The responder (B) is a cylindi-ical brass box which presents on its upper surface

a similar dial with its thermometric scales and index ; at its base three binding

screws, corresponding to those of the questioner, are fixed for connecting the tele-

gi-aphic wires, and it is furnished with a brass cover that it may be hermetically

--sealed when lowered in the sea or bm-ied in the ground. Its interior contains three

essentially distinct parts : 1. The metallic thermometer, which consists of a spiral

ribbon of two dissimilar metals, with its hand capable of ranging through the ex-

Atent of the circvdar thermometric scale of the dial. 2.        small electromagnet,

acting by means of a propelment on a disk, making as many stops in one rotation as

Anthere are half degrees on the scale. .3.  axis, to which is fixed a delicate spiral

spring which causes a pin to bear lightly against the hand of the thermometer,

however it may vary in position.

The two iusti'umeuts are connected by means of two telegraphic wires. The

first proceeds from an earth-plate at the near station, passes through the coil of the

electromotor in A, joins the coil of tlie small electromagnet in B, and then pro-

ceeds to another eai'th-plate at the distant station. The second wire is perma-

nently connected with the first between the earth-plato and the coil of the mag-

netomotor, and includes that of the electromagnet in B, and its opposite end is

brought close to the remote end of the first wire. The mechanism is so disposed

that when the first wire is disconnected from its earth terminal it is brought into

circuit with the second wire.

  ABy this arrangement, when the dial of is brought to 0° and the handle turned,

at the first moment the ch-ciut is completed through the first wire, containing the

coil of the electromagnet in B, and the return earth. .\ disk is thereby caused to

revolve in an opposite direction to the gi-aduation of the scale, until a pin, originally

starting from O'", comes into contact with t!ie pin pressing against the thennometer

hand, and thereby comjiletes the circuit of the second wire and breaks the connexion

Bwith the earth-plate. At first only the electromagnet in is acted upon, but

when the cun-ents are diverted into the new channel, both the electromagnets

Aact simultaneously. In consequence of the action of the electromagnet, in the

hand of its dial passes over a space corresponding witli that between 0° and that

indicated by the thermometer, and the hand of the dial ultimately accords with

Athat of the distant thermonicter. When the hand of tlie dial on comes to rest,

Bthe di.sk in arrives at 0°, and a catch permits the spiral spring to unwind itself,

and its pin fiies to and presses against the thermometer hand.

   It must be observed tliat instruments thus constructed are not capable of mark-

ing every possible gradation ; but they may be made to indicate divisions of the

scale of any reqiured minuteness. It is ad^-isable to limit the extent of the scale

when more minute divisions are deemed necessary,

   The only circumstance that can affect the accuracy of the indications of the in-
strument "is this. The jjiu pressing against the thermometric index displaces it a
little, and causes it to assume a position about a degree in advance ; but as this
pressure is a constant one, the inconvenience is remedied by a slight corresponding

shifting of the scale.

   Hooper.

   The author referred to the relation existing between the different properties of

insulated wires arising from induction. He showed by an extensive series of ex-

periments that an intimate connexion exists between the effects of electrification
and electrostatic induction, and that the penetration of electricity into the substance

of an insulator, when measured by the residual discharge, is a function of the electro-
static capacity, and not simply of resistance. He has also shown that the effects

of electrification are increased nearly in the same proportion as the interior induc-

tive action is reduced.

                             By William Ladd, F.B.A.S.

   Siemens and "Wlieatstone have shown that the residual magnetism left in soft
iron, after being under the influence of a batten,^, or permanent steel magnets, can
be augmented from the currents generated by itself, bj- merely applj-ing d^Tiamic

force to the revolving armature containing a coil of copper wire, the terminals of
which are connected with the wire surrounding the electromagnet, but although
great effects were produced in the electromag-net, the current itself could only be

--made available by its partial or total disruption in the former case diminishing

the power of the electromagnet, and in the latter reducing it to its normal condition.
The author has constructed a machine, in which the power of the electromagnet is
kept up, whilst a separate current, to be applied to any useful purpose, can be drawn
oft by means of an independent arrangement. The machine consists chiefly of two
plates of ii'on ; to both ends of each plate is fixed a poiiion of a hollow cylinder
these plates are tlien placed a certain distance apart, and insulated fi'om each other,
in such a manner that the cylindrical pieces form two hollow circular passages ; into
these spaces two Siemens's armatures are placed.

   The plates are surrounded by coils of stout copper wire connected together,
the two tenuinals being brought into connexion with the commutator of the
smaller armature, so that each change of polarity hi the armature will augment the

power of the electromagnet. When the machine is first made, it is only requisite

to pass a current from a small voltaic cell for an instant, to give the iron a polarity,
it will then retain a sufficient amount of magnetism for all future work.

   If the armature in connexion with the electromagnet is made to rotate, there

will be a ^ery feeble current generated iu it ; this, passing round the electromagnet,
will increase its jiower willi every additional impulse. It will thus be seen that
the only limit to the power of the machine is the rapidity with which the arma-

ture is made to rotate, which is entirely dependent en the amonnt of dynamic force
employed; but the great improvement iu this machine is the introduction of the

second armature, which, although it takes oft' very powerful currents generated in
its wire by the increased magnetism, does not at all interfere with the primary

current of the electromagnet. The machine exhibited in the Paris Exhibition
measures about 24 in. in length, 12 in. in width, and stands 7 in. high, which,
notwithstanding its imperfect proportions, is capable of keeping 56 in. of platinum
wire, '01 in. diameter, incandescent, when a small voltameter was placed in circuit

electi-ic regulator would yield aligit equal to about 35 Grove's or Bimsen's elements,     i
the driving-power expended being less than one horse.

   1 have also constructed another form of machine, on the same principle as that
described above, but instead of having two independent armatm'es running in sepa-
rate gi'ooves, they are hxed end to end, so as to appear like one continuous anna-
ture, but so placed with reference to each other that their magnetic axes shall be

at riglit angles. By this an'angement there is only one opening required for the

armature, enabling full advantage to be taken of the horseshoe form of electro-
magnet. The shoes of the electromagnet and armatures are so proportioned to
each other that there is an actual break in the magnetic circuit with reference to
each armature alternately, but by their disposition at light angles there never is an
actual break in the complete mag-netic circuit ; simply a shifting occm's of the prin-
cipal portion of the magnetic force from one armatm-e to the other at the precise

moment requii'ed to produce the best effect. The mechanical advantages to be ob-
tained by this disposition of parts must be at once obvious, as one pair of bearings
and a set of driving gear are dispensed with, and from the lixing oi the two arma-
tures together the currents are made to iiow perfectly isochronous with each other.
It may be found advantageous to vary the angle of position of the arjnatures with

reference to eacli otlier, according to the speed at whicli they are driven, so that tlie

cm-rent given oti'by the exciting armature may at the precise moment exert its full

eflect upon the electromagnet, and thus produce the bast eiiect in the second ar-

matui'e.

Notice of a proposal to illutninate Beacons and Buoys by Electricity, conveyed

   throuyh Submarine Wires connected ivitJi the Shore. By T. Stevenson,

   used for this purpose in the first experiments made for the Northern Liyhts
   Board, (dso the Electriccd Apparatus recently desiyned for the Northern

    Liyhts, by C. "W. SrEME^'s, F.It.S.

   The gTcat expense of such lighthouses as the Eddystono and Bellrock has rendered
it necessary for the sailor to be contented in many places of danger with a simple bea-
con or floating buoj-, which, being invisible at night, ceases to be useful at tiie
very time of .all others when a guide is most needed. Various expedients for light-
ing these sea-marks, such as camphiue lamps and phosphorescent oils capable of
emitting a dull light in the dark, have been proposed. In January 18-54 I pro-
posed in Trans. Koy. Scot. Soc. Arts to lay gas-pipes between the shore and the
beacon and " submarine electric wires for illuminating a lantern placed in a beacon

or buoy." As stated in that paper, however, " I dismissed such schemes from my

mind ; for independently of many other difficulties attending them, they are open to

one ground of objection, which, at least in the present state of our knowledge,

seems insurmountable. This is based on what may be called an axiom in light-

house engineering, viz. that it is better to exhibit no light at all than one which
is liable to be often extinguished."

   Under these circumstances I at that time suggested an entirely different method
of illuminating beacons, namely, a beam of parallel rays of light projected from
the shore upon optical agents placed upon the beacon at sea, and capable of
spreading the rays over any required angle in azimuth, so as to produce a mock cr
apparent light. This method has been in use at Stornoway Loch without any
accident or failure for the last fifteen years. There are, however, certain places
where this apparent or mock light is not very suitable, owing to the primary light
and reflected light being nearly in line. This consideration, coupled ndth the im-
pro\ement3 which have subsequently taken place in electrical appliances, led me,
in 18(35, in a report to the Northern Lights Board on the magneto-electric light, to
                 TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                   15

myrevert to   former proposal of leading electricity through wires for the illuinina-

tiou of beacons and buoys at sea.

For such a piu-pose neither Holmes' nor Wilde's light could be employed, as they

are produced by the rapid consumption of carbon?, and require the employment of

lamp machinery, v/liich, though to a large extent automatic, involves the constant

presence of a lightkeeper in the lantern. I therefore resolved on employing the

simple electric spark, eitlier by itself or in vacuum tubes. After consulting with

my friend Professor Sv,'an, who suggested the combination of tlie Leyden jar with

the induction-coil, experiments were made, and in an interim communication to

the Scot. Soc. Arts on loth January 186G, I was able to report that, " by means of

four Bunsen cells, an induction-coil, and a Ley den jar, I liad succeeded with a

simple unaided sparlc placed in the focus of liglithouse apparatus, to produce an

effect at the distance of about half a mile, which was in all respects satisfactory."

Tlie light might have been seen much furth.er but for the intervention of obstructious

to the view.

The Commissioners of Northern Lights, on the recommendation of Messrs. Ste-

venson, in their report of 1st February 1866, procured, with the sanction of the

Board of Trade, a submarine cable from Messrs. Siemens of London, but as the

cable was not suitable for this kind of apparatus, the current could not be passed

imder the water. Messrs. Stevenson then reported to the Board that, as ]Mi\

Siemens had thought of a difierent form of apparatus, he shoidd be employed to

furnish one. This beautifid arrangement is now exhibited, and Mr. Siemens has
kindly sent me a description of its difierent parts, which I shall afterwards read.

While Mr. Siemens was engaged with this instrument, I received many impor-

tant suggestions as to the induction-spark apparatus. Mr. Brebner, C.E., sug-

gested that the induction-coU shoidd be placed on the beacon, while the break and

batteries should be on the shore. Dr. S. Wright recommended that, instead of one

large coil, several coils of small intensity should be used ; and Mr. Hart, who con-

ducted all the experiments, and to whose untiring zeal is mainly due whatever

amount of efficiency the induction-spark apparatus may possess, added a new con-

tact breaker with two magnets and a double break.

  By means of these improvements the light was Icept in action during a week at

the expense of about 2 shillkigs for 16 hours, with a current passing through a wire
800 feet long. The light so produced, as viewed from the .sea and elsewhere, was

perfectly suflicieut for tlie purpose required. It may be ailded, that of all the
metals which I have tried a wire of bismutli produced the brightest spark. The

effect might, perhaps, be also increased without using additional cells, if the same

cuiTents could be again utilized so as to generate a second spark in the focus.

There can be no doubt that a sufRcient light can be obtained either from the

induction-spark or from the arrangement of Mr. Siemens, to be afterwards described.
Beacon lights, which are needed for pointing out local dangers, do not, of course,

require to be of tlie gi-eat power wliicli is needed in lighthouses for illuminating

the ocean. In determining which of Ihe two kinds of "apparatus should be pre-

ferred, the point turns upon wliich is likely to be tlie most certain in its exhibition.

Each method has its own peculiar advantages and disadvantages. In the induc-

tion-spark apparatus the contact brealvcr is on the shore and under control, but, on

the other hand, the coils may periiaps not last long. In Mr. Siemens's apparatus the
products of combustion may perhaps afl'ect the efficiency of the optical apparatus,
and the moving parts are at sea and beyond control. 'Nothing but a continuous

tri.al for some leugtli of time can determine which is the preferable. It is to be

hoped that one or other may prove suitable, for the conveyance of electricity from

the shore to outlying rocks promises to form a new and most important" era in

maritime illumination. Tlie time, indeed, mav not be far distant wlien such a

navigation as the entrance to Liverpool ^^^ll be as clearlv defined at night as in the
daytime, by the illumination of its beacons and buoys I'lv electricitv.

   Mr. Siemens's apparatus was worked by twenty cells, wliile the iuductiou-sparii:
had only six, but when fully equipped, it' will be' ^^·orkcd by eighteen cells. Each
apparatus was shown in the focus of a Ilolophote, the former producing the most

powerful flash.
--16 REPORT 1867.

   Mr. C. W. Siemens, F.E.S., of London, having been asked by Messrs. Stevenson

for suggestions as to the best means to be adopted for carrj-ing out Mr. T. Stevenson's
proposal for producing a flashing light upon a beacon, by means of a land battery
connected to the beacon through a submarine cable, embodied his views in a letter
addressed by him to Messrs. Stevenson on the 1st October 1866. After reviewing
the objections to other methods, he recommended the application of the extra-
cim-ent together with a self-feeding mercui-y contact, as the only practical method
in which the flash is not destroyed by electric charge of the connecting cable. Mr.
Siemens having been authorized [by the Northern Light Commissioners to con-
struct an apparatus in accordance with his views, has submitted the same to a suc-

cessful trial.

   The apparatus upon the beacon or buoy consists of a heavy electromagnet, the
coils of which are permanently connected with the conducting wire of the cable on
the one hand, and with a contact lever on the other hand, which contact lever is
actuated by the armature of the electromagnet in the mamier of a nefts hammer.
The circuit with the battery (consisting of fi'om ten to twenty Bunsen's elements)

on land is completed through the sea. When the cun-ent has had time to excite the

electromagnet sufficiently for it to atti-act its heavy armature, the motion of the
latter breaks the circuit, which breakage is accompanied with a spark proportionate
to the accumulated magnetism, and^ in some measure also to the capacity of the
cable, which in this apparatus does not destroy, but rather assists the effect.^ The
luminous effect is increased by a slight combustion of mercury, which latter is con-

tinually renewed by a circulating pump worked by the armature, by which ar-

rangement a good and permanent contact is ensured.

   The apparatus described in a recent communication to the Royal Societj', en-
titled "On a Self-acting Apparatus for multiplying and maintaining Electric Charges,
with applications to illustrate the Voltaic Theory," was exhibited in action. Both
Leyden jars being at first discharged as completely as could be done by keeping
their outer .and inner coatings connected for several days, they became charged,

one positively and the other negatively, through the action of the drops of water,
to such a degree, in the course of a few minutes, as to cause the jets of water to
scatter over the lips of the receivers. The jars were afterwards repeatedly dis-
charged, and the rapid reaccumulation of charges was shown to the Meeting by
the scattering of the jets, by electroscopic tests, and by sparks drawn from the in-

sulated conductors.

  --Conceive a closed circuit, CTABC, according to the following description : One

portion of it, TA, tangential to a circular disk of conducting material and somewhat
longer than the radius ; the continuation, AB, at right angles to this in the plane

of the wheel, of a length equal to the radius ; and the completion of the circuit
by a fork, BO, extending to an axle bearing the wheel. If all of the wheel were
cut away except a portion, CT, from the axle to the point of contact, at the cir-

cumference, the circuit would form a simple rectangle, CTAB, except the bifurca-

tion of the side 130. Let a fixed magnet be placed so as to give lines of force

perpendicidar to the wheel, in the parts of it between C the centre and T thepoint

of the circumference touched by the fixed conductor} and let power bo applied to

cause the wheel to rotate in the cUrection towards A. According to Faraday's

Wfll-kuo\^Ti discovery, a cuirent is induced iu the circuit in such a direction that

the mutual electromagnetic action between it and the fixed magnet resists the

motion of the wheel. Now the mutual electromagnetic force between the por-

ABtions  and CT of the circuit is reiiulsive, according to the well-known elementary

law of Ampere, and therefore resists the actual motion of the wheel ; hence if

the magnet be removed there will still be electromagnetic induction tending to

maintain the cm-rent. Let us suppose the velocity of the wheel to" have been at

first no greater than that practically attained in ordinary experiments with Barlow's

electromagnetic disk. As the magnet is gradually withdrawn let the velocity be
gradually increased, so as to keep the strength of the cm-rent constant, and, when

the magnet is quite away, to maintain the current solely by electromagnetic in-
duction betweeu the fixed and moveable portions of the circuit. If, when the

magnet is away, the wheel be forced to rotate faster than the limiting velocity of

our previous supposition, the cm-rent will be augmented according- to the law of

compound interest, and would go on thus increasing without limit were it not

that the resistance of the circuit would become g-reater in virtue of the elevation of

temperature produced by the cm-rent. The velocity of rotation, which gives by

induction an electromotive force exactly to that required to maintain the current,
is clearly independent of the strength of the cm-rent. The mathematical deter-

mination of it becomes complicated by the necessity of taking into account the

diffusion of the current through portions of the disk not in the straight line between

C and T but it is very simple and easy if we prevent this diffusion by cutting the

wheel into an infinite number of infinitely thin spokes, a great number of whicli

are to be simultaneously in contact with the fixed conductor at T. The linear

velocitj' of the circumference of the wheel in the limiting case bears to the velocity

which measures, iu absolute measure, the resistance of the circuit, a ratio (deter-

minable by the solution of the mathematical problem) which depends on the pro-

portions of the rectangle CTAB, and is independent of its absolute dimensions.

Lastly, suppose the wheel to be kept rotating at any constant velocity, whether

above or below the velocity determined bj' the preceding considerations ; and sup-
pose the cm-rent to be temporarily excited in auy way, for instance, by bringing a

magnet into the neighbourhood and then withdrawing it; the strength of this current

will diminish towards zero or will increase towards infinity, according as the velo-

city is below or above the critical velocity. The diminution or augmentation

would follow the compound interest law if the resistance in the circuit remained

constant. The conclusion presents us with this wonderful residt : that if we

commence with absolutely no electric current, and give the wheel auy velocity of

rotation exceeding- the critical velocity, the electric equilibrium is unstable : au

infinitesimal current in either direction would augment until by heating the cir-

cuit, the electric resistance becomes increased to such au extent, that the electro-

motive force of induction j ust suffices to keep the current constant.

It will be difficult, perhaps impossible, to realize this result in practice, because

of the great velocity required, and the difficidty of maintaining good frictional con-

tact at the circumference, without enormous liictioU; and consequently frictional

generation of heat.

The electromag-netic augmentation and maintenance of a cm-rent discovered by

Siemens, aud put iu practice by him, with the aid of soft iron, and proved by

Maxwell to be theoretically possible without soft iron, suggested the subject of

this communication to the author, and led him to endeavoiu- to arrive at a similar

result with only a single circiut, and no making and breaking of contacts ; and it is

only these characteristics that constitute the peculiarity of the arrangement which

he now describes.

On Volta-Convection hy Flame. By Sir W. Thomson, LL.D., F.Ii.S.

   In Nichols' Cyclopedia (2nd edition), article " Electricitj', Atmospheric," and in

the Proceedings of the Royal Society, May 1860 (Lecture on Atmospheric Elec-

tricity), the author had pointed out that the efi'ect of the fhime in an insulated

lamp, is to reduce the lamp and other conducting matej'ial connected with it to the

1S67.                                                                   2

same potential as that of the air in the neighbourhood of the flame ; and that the        i
efl'ect of a iine jet of -neater from an insulated vessel, is to bring the vessel and
other conducting material connected with it to the same potential as th.at of the
air, at the point where the jet breaks into drops. In a recent communication to

the Royal Societj- "On a Self-acting Apparatus for multiplying and maintaining

Electric Charges, with applications to illustrate the Voltaic Theory," an experi-
ment was described in which a water-dropping apparatus was employed to prove
the difference of potential in the air, in the neighbourhood of bright metallic sur-
faces of zinc and copper, metallically connected with one another, which is to bo
expected from Volta's discovery of contact electi'icity. In the present communi-
cation a similar experiment was described, in which the flame of a spirit lamp was

used instead of a jet of water breaking into drops.

  A spirit lamp is placed on an insulated stand connected with a very delicate

electrometer. Copper and zinc cylinders, in metallic connexion with the metal
case of the electrometer, are alternateh' held vertically in such a position that the
flame burns nearly in the centre of the cylinder, which is open at both ends. If
the electrometer reading, with the copper cylinder surrounding the flame, is called

zei-o, the reading ob^^erved with the zinc cylinder surrounding the flame indicates

positive electrification of the insulated stand bearing the lamp.

   It is to be remarked that the different methotls here followed eliminate the
ambiguity involved in what is meant by the potential of a conducting system
composed partly of flame (alcohol) and partly of metal. In a merely illustrative
experiment, which tlie author has already made, the amount of diflerence made by
substituting the zinc cylinder for the copper cylinder roimd the flame, was rather
more tlian half the difference of potential maintained by a single cell of Daniell's.

Thus, when the sensibility of the quadrant divided-ring electrometer * was such

that a single cell of Daniell's gave a deflection of 79 .scale-divisions, the difference

of the reading, when the zipc cylinder was substituted for the copper cylinder round
the insulated lamp, was 39 scale-divisions. From other experiments on contact
electricity made seven years ago by the author, and agreeing with results which
have been published by Ilank-el, it appears that the diflerence of potentials in the
air, in the neighbourhood of bright metallic surfaces of zinc and copper in metallic

connexion with one another, is "about three-quarters of that of a single cell of
DnnielFs. It is quite certain tliat the difference produced in the metal connected

with the insulated lamp, would be exactly equal to the true contact diflerence of
the metals, if the interior .surfaces of the metal cylinders were perfectly metallic
(free from oxidation or any other tarnishing, such as by sulphur, iodine, or any other
body) provided the distance of the inner .surface of the cylinder from the iianie is

                             ;

everywhere sufficient to prevent conduction hj heated air between them, and pro-
vided the length of the c}'linder is infinite (or, practically, anything more than three

or foui- times its diameter).

old experiments on contact electricity, of which a slight notice appeared in the

   To facilitate the application of an in.strumcnt for recording the signals of the
Atlantic cable, recently patented by Sir "W. Tliomson, a small electric machine
running easily enough to be driven bj' the wheelwork of an ordinary Morse instru-
ment was desired ; and he therefore designed a combination of the electrophorus
principle, with the system of reciprocal induction described by liim in a recent
comnnmication to the Poyal Societj- (Proceedings, June 1867), which may be

briefly described as follows :

  A wheel of vulcanite with a large number of pieces of metal (called caniers, for

brevity) attached to its rim, is kept rotating rapidlj^ roiuid a fixed axis. The car-
riers are very lightly touched at ojipusite ends of a diameter by two fixed tangent
springs. One of these s.prings (the earth-spring) is connected with the eai'th, and

tlie other (the receiver-spring') with an insulated piece of metal called the receiver,
which is analogous to the " prime conductor " of an ordinary electric machine.

The point of contact of the earth-spring with the carriers is exposed to the in-

fluence of an electrified hody (generally an insulated piece of metal) called the in-

ductor. When this is negatively electrified, each carrier comes away from contact

with the earth-spring, carrying positive electricity, which it gives up to the re-

ceiver-spring. The receiver and inductor are each hollowed out to a proper shape,
and are properly placed to surround, each as nearly as may be, the point of contact

of the corresponding spring.

The inductor, for the good working of the machine, should be kept electrified to

a constant potential. This is effected by an adjunct called the replenisher, which

may be applied to the main wheel, but which, for a large instrument, ought to be
worked by a much smaller carrier-wheel, attached either to the same or to another

turning shaft.

The replenisher consists chiefly of two properly shaped pieces of metal called

inductors, which are fixed in the neighbourhood of a carrier-wheel, such as that

described above, and four fixed spriugs touching the carriers at the ends of two

diameters. Two of these springs (called receiver-springs ) are connected respectively

with the inductors ; and the other two (called connecting springs) are insulated
and connected with one another. They are so situated that they are touched by

the can-iers on emerging from the inductors, and shortly after the contacts with the

receiver-springs. If any ditt'erence of potential between the inductors is given to

begin with, the action of the carriers, as is easily seen, increases it according to the

compound interest law as long as the insulation is perfect. Practically, in a few
seconds after the machine is started running, bright flashes and sparks begin to

fly about in various parts of the apparatus, even although the inductors and con-

nectors have been kept for days as carefidlj' discharged as possible. The only in-
strument yet made is a very small one (with carrier-wheel two inches in diameter)

constructed for the Atlantic Telegraph application ; but its action has been so

startlingly successfid that great eflects may be expected from larger machines on

the same plan.

"When this instrument is used to replenish the charge of the inductor in tlie

con.<tant electric machine, described above, one of its inductors is connected
with the earth and the other with the inductor to be replenished. "Wlien accurate

coustancj' is desired, a gauge-electroscope is applied to break and make contact
between the coimector springs of the replenisher when the potential to be main-
tained rises above or falls below a certain limit.

Several usefurapplications of the replenisher for scientific obsen'ation were shown

among others, to keep up the charge in the Lejden jar for the divided-ring mirror-

electrometer, especially when this instrument is used for recording atmospheric
Aelectricity.
                small replenisher, attached to the instrument within the jar, is

worked by a little milled head on the outside, a few turns of which suffice to re-

plenish the loss of twenty -foiu' hours.

A Comparison of the Kew and Lisbon Magnetic Curves during the Disturbance

    of February 20-25, 1866. Bi/ Senhor Capello. Communicated by Dr.
   Balfouk Stewart, F.E.S.

   Dui-iuo: the 20tb, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24tli, and 25th of February 1866, large mag-
netic disturbances were recorded by the magnetogi'aphs at the Lisbon ObserA'atory.
The present communication, relative to these distm-bauces, oiiers some interest on
account of the apparent Aariability of the forces which are in action during the
same disturbance, and also the apparently variable relations between these forces
at Lisbon and the same forces at Kew. In a former comparison certain laws were
deduced, and it was interesting to know if they were confirmed.

On the Results of Observations of Atmospheric Electricity at Kew Observatory
              and at ^\indsor, Nova Scotia. By Dr. J. D. Everett.

   The Kew obsei-vatious included in this paper extended from June 1862 to May

1864 inclusive, and were taken with Sii- "William Thomson's self-recording appa-
ratus ; specimens of the photogi-aphic curves thus taken being exhibited at the
fleeting. The "Windsor observations taken by Dr. Everett with apparatus of a
 different kind, also invented by Sir William Tliomson, but not self-recording, ex-
tended from October 1862 to August 1864. Montlily averages which had been

taken showed that at Kew there had in every month been two maxima in the day,

 one of them between eight and ten a.m., and the other, which was more conside-
rable, between eight and ten p.m. At "Windsor, on the contrary, the electricity
between eight and ten p.m. had in every month been weaker than either between

eight and ten a.m. or between two and three p.m. The annual curve for Kew had
its principal maximmn in November, and another in February or March. At

Windsor the principal nuiximum was in February or March, and the minima in
Jime and November. The annual cm-ves for the two places agi-eed pretty well
from January to October, but were cmwed in opposite directions from October to

 January.

           On the Meteor Shower of Aur/ust 1867. By George Forbes.

                           Communicated by Professor Swan, F.li.S.E.

    The author gave the results of certain observations made by him at St.
 Andi-ews on the meteor shower of August 18G7. The nights following the 0th,
 10th, and 11th of the month were very cloudy, and no obseiTations could bo made.
 Most of the observations were made on the eAening of the 10th and morning of
 the 11th. But even on this night a faint haze for the most part covered the sky.
 The meteors were almost all of the same size as stai-s of the .3rd or 4th magnitude.
 They were, with few exceptions, white. They lasted in general only about half a
 second. They were very rapid in their flight. One could hardly dislinguish any
 nucleus. The train was visible, after its formation, only for a very small fraction
 of a second ; and breaks in their tracks of about 1° were frequently noticed. The
 lengths of their paths extended from 3° to 15°, though in some cases they were 30°
 in length. Attention was chiefly directed to discovering the points of radiation,

--and to noting the times of appearance.

 points ; the one in the region of Casseiopeia, the other about Andromeda. By
 drawing on the spot the courses of the meteors among the stars, the points of radia-

influence of tlie earth's rotation and tlie liipli temperature which prevails in the

northern hemisphere. At JNiaiiritius these gales are characterised by a barometric

pressure of aO-200 to :30'400 inches. The wind sets in at .South to 8.8.E., and

seldom veers more than a point or two, the barometer at times oscillating- during

the height of the gale, which is sometimes attended with passing showers, but
never with heavy rain, thunder, or lightning. Generally the gale commences in
about 30° S., and advances towards the equator, like an extensive wave or billow,
the barometer rising at each successive locality some time before the wind acquires

much force. It is preceded by a heavy sea, which occasionally proves dangerous

near the equator. It lasts from one to ten days, and blows in fitful gusts, which

at JMauritius have usually a pressure of 1 to 10 lbs. on the square foot, and at times

of 10 to 20 lbs. Owing to the frequency of these gales the mean daily maximum

force of the wind at Mauritius is greater in winter than in summer.

   2. The extra-tropical gales, between the parallels of 30° and 45° S., also

occur in all seasons, but are most violent from May to August inclusive. These

gales are generally characterised by the presence of two currents of air, the one

from the southward, and the other from the northward, the two currents being

variously situated with respect to each other. At times they exist side by side, as

surface-winds, the one fi-om the S.W., and the other from the N.E., each occupy-

ing a belt of 5° to 30° in longitude, stretching from the parallel of 30'^ S. as far south

as the observations extend, viz. 45° S. In the narrow space between the two winds,

light airs, calms, and a high cross sea, with heavy rain, thunder, and lightning, gene-

rally prevail, and there the barometer is lowest. The belt of southerly winds lies

to the west of the belt of northerly winds, and the two travel laterally to the east-

ward, preserving their relative positions often for several days. The gale of the 13th

to the 20th of January, 18(Jl, as would be seen by inspecting a number of charts

illustrative of it, was a good example, and many others might be adduced. The

barometer stands higher, and the thermometer lower, in the southerly than in the

northerly -wind. On the western side of the former the barometer has Ijeen knowli

to stand as high as 30-650 inches, while in the trough, or space between the two

winds, it stood at 29000 inches. Sometimes there are several alternate belts of

southerly and northerly wiuds, as in gales which took place on the 27th and 28th

of July, 1863.

In place of forming parallel belts, however, the two winds are often inclined, and

sometimes direetlj' opposed, to each other. Occasionally, too, onlj^ one of them

appears, the other, if it exists at all, being either above tlie surface-wind, or away

in the South Atlantic, to which the observations do not extend. This was the case

from the I4th to the 20tli of IMay, 1865, when a violent north-wester occurred in

the space between the meridian of Greenwich and 32° E., and the parallels of 30°

and 45° S.

   But whatever may be the positions of the two currents of air, the gales inva-

riably travel to the eastward, and many of them have been traced from the meri-
dian of Greenwich to 65° E. Where they originate, and how far they travel, has

not been determined. It does not appear that they are revolving- gales, although

whirlwinds may occasionally occur between the inner edges of the two  wiuds                                for
                                                                                                        ;

in no instance has the wind been traced round an axis, or central area, as in the case

of the tropical hurricanes. They take place with so much unifonnity and regularity
that their progress may be traced from day to day and hour to hoiu', and the man-

ner of the veering or shifting of the wind, when there are two currents, be kno^vn

beforehand, the shift being (often suddenly) from N.E. to S.W., or from N.W.rd

to S.W.rd, and the veering from N.E. to North, N.W., West, &c., or with the sun.
They last from one to seven days, and travel at the rate of four to twenty miles an
hour. The wind usually sets in at N.E.rd and ends at S.W.rd, or S.E.rd. After
the shift, or when the wind comes to the south of west, the barometer rises, and
in a few hours the wind gradually abates. They succeed one another at short in-

tervals and with considerable regularity, but vary in force. Even the ordinary

changes of wind and weather in that part of the ocean seem to be more or less

dependent upon the antagonistic currents of air to which reference has been made.

  3. Many persons were at first little disposed to accept the ' Law of Storms ' as
laid down by Redfield, Ileid, Thorn, and Piddington, and there were points on

which these -writers themselves were, not agreed. Even at the present day there

are shipmasters and others who put little faith in the theory of revolving storms.

But a careful investigation of all the ;jreat storms which have occurred iu the In-

dian Ocean, south of the equator, during- the last eighteen years, has amply con-

firmed the truth of the theory iu the main. On the other hand, some corrections

and modihcations are required.

   These rotatory storms, which are confined to the months of November to May in-
chisive, originate between the parallels of 6° to 14° S., and travel to the W.S'W.,

and afterwards, but not always, to the southward and S.E. ; the wind invariably
moving round a central space (which is usually characterised by a calm) from

left to right, or with the hands of a watch ; while the stonn, which has a diameter
of 1 to 1500 miles, moves onwards at the rate of 1 to 20 miles, but more frequently

4 to 7 miles an hour, for a period varying from a few hours to ten davs, attended

with torrents of rain, and in its northern half often with lightning.

   It would appear that when they were tirst made a subject of investigation,

attention was chiefly directed to what took place within the storm, all the infor-

mation regarding it having been derived fi-om a few vessels which had been involved
in it; while little notice was taken of the state of the prevailing winds at a distance,
or of the possible connexion between them and the origin and progress of the storm.
Hence some waiters appear to have regarded them as detached disks of air, put
and sustained in motion by electricity, magnetism, earthquakes, or some other

mysterious agency.

   One of the lirst results of the extended system of observation adopted at Mauritius
was to show, what had been surmised by Dr. Thom, that these revolving storms
are invariably generated between the N.W. monsoon and the S.E. trade-wind, and

that to all appearance their rise and progress are intimatel}' connected with those
two opposing winds. The fact that they occur only during the monsoon months

in itself favours the supposition of a connexion between the two phenomena.
   Observation has shown that the monsoon extends farther south on the western

than on the eastern side of the Ocean, its southern limits often stretching obliquely
from Tamatave, in Madagascar, on the west, to Sumatra on the east. To the south

of the N.W. monsoon the S.E. trade-wind prevails. Between the two winds there

is a space of calms, or light variables. During hot sidtry weather evaporation
must take place rapidly, especially in the trade-wind region. The vapour is carried
by the two winds towards the space w^hich separates them, and is accumulated

there until the air becomes saturated. There may at the same time be an ascend-
ing column of air and vapour, which would further promote condensation. Heavy

rain sets in, the barometer falls, and the two oppositely directed wnnds flow to-
wards the locality of diminished pi-essm-e, bringing with them more vapour, which

is also speedily converted into rain, the barometer falling lower.

   As the vapour is chiefly supplied by the S.E. trade-^\dud, and its precipitation in
the trade-wmd region is followed by a decrease of barometric pressure there, the
movement of the area of diminished pressure is towards the south, across the trade-
wind region, the N.W. monsoon, and the N.E. trade-wind to the north of it, where

tlie barometer is high, pressing to the southward to restore the equilibrium, and
the monsoon, as it were, eating into the trade-wind as the aqueous precipitation

proceeds. In this way the monsoon sometimes- advances along its whole extent in

longitude to the tropic of Capricorn, or even beyond it, until the trade-wind alto-

gether disappears, or is found only far to the south. When the vapour has been

precipitated the trade-wind gradually returns, the monsoon receding before it to
the northward, imtil the two winds again attain their normal positions. After a
lapse of some time, during which another accumulation of vapour takes place,
heavy rains a^-ain commence on the equatorial borders of the trade-wind, and the
monsoon again advances to the southward. The two winds thus oscillate back-
wards and forwards during the summer months, and it is on these occasions, when
the monsoon is advancing to the southward, that the tropical revolving storms
occur, the south-west and west sides of the storm being apparently fed by the
trade-wind, and its north-east and east sides bj' the monsoon.

   Instances of the advancement of the monsoon to the southward, as from the
l.Sth-to the ISth of February, 1800, the 16th to the 20th of January, 1861, the 1st
to the ISth of February, 1861, and the 16th to the 24th of February, I860, were given
in a series of charts showing the directions of the wind at noon on each day.
--24 REPORT 1867.

    Revolving storms, however, do not always take place on such occasions, altliough,
as the monsoon approaches, the wind generally veers from E.S.E. to East, North,

and N.W., with much rain, and generally thimder and lightning. Nor does the
monsoon always advance along its whole extent in longitude, but more frequently

penetrates into the trade-wind, and then only one rotatory storm is formed. When

the monsoon and trade-wind are in collision over a considerable extent of longi-

tude, or across the whole ocean, two or more revolving stomis may be formed, which

sometimes rage together for several days, as in the case of two violent hurricanes

which occurred between the 8th and the 17tli of Februarj', 1861, and of several

others between the 6th and 24th of April, 1866. On occasions like these as many
as five rotatory storms ha^'e been known to exist at the same time along the inner

borders of the two winds, but they did not all last long.

    In the earlier and latter parts of the season these storms often do not travel
beyond the parallel of 16° S. They are most frequent in February and March, and
during those months they generally advance to 25° S., and sometimes to 30° or
32° S. Their tracks are generally curves, the convexities of which are towards the
west, and the apices anywhere between the parallels of 14° and 24° S., according
to the season. It would appear that they traverse the trade-wind region in conse-

quence of the progress of the aqueous precipitation being in that direction, and of
the monsoon extending farther south on the western than on the eastern side of
the ocean, as already stated. The direction of the wind in the body of the storm

may be accounted for hj the relative positions and directions of the" monsoon and

trade-wind, independently of the earth's rotation on its axis, although that also

may have an effect.
   With regard to the form of these storms, it varies, and is not so circular as is usually

supposed. The wind generally blows spirally towards and ultimately around the
centre, as is shown, not only by the collective evidence of vessels on all sides of the
storm, but also by individual vessels occasionally running completely round the cen-

tre, and being gradually drawn into it. An example of this occun-ed in May, 1863,
when a vessel belonging to the port of Dundee, called the ' Earl of 1 )alhousie"' CCapt.

Campbell), scudded, at the rate of 10 to 13 knots an hour, three times round the
centre of a revolving storm, which at the time happened to be nearly stationan-,

till at length she reached the centi-al calm. (Charts were exhibited showing the

positions of the vessels and directions of the M-ind in this storm at noon on each
day from the 7th to the 20th of the month.)

   As the trade-wind in front of a revolving storm often blows in strong gales with
a falling barometer over many degrees in longitude, and the direction of the wind,

especially at a distance, is far from being at right angles to the bearing of the
centre, severe losses have occurred in consequence of vessels, having the wind at

S.E., running to the west or N.W. with the view of crossing the storm's path,
under the impression that the centre bore N.E. In place of bearing N.E., when
the wind is from S.E., the centre may bear North or N.N.W., and if the storm be
travelling to the S.W., as is often the case, a vessel steering westward or N.W.
may be running to her destruction. During a humcane in February, 1860, for
example, a number of vessels left the roadsteads of Reunion with the wind at
S.E., and, rmming to the N.W., got into the heart of the storm. Several of
them were wrecked on the coast of Madagascar, others were never heard of, and
of those that returned some had to be abandoned. The safest course seems to be
to lie to and watch the barometer and wind till the bearing of the centre be known

with some certainty.

   But perhaps the greatest losses of life and property in the Indian Ocean south of
the Equator arise fi-om homeward-bound vessels running into revolving storms to the
southward of them, by taking supposed advnntage of the N.E. winds of a storm,
between the parallels of 10° and 16° S., and steering to the S.W. till they get in

fi'ont of the storm. This is the more to be regretted, inasmuch as all such losses may

be easily avoided by lying-to till the barometer rises and the weather improves, or by
proceeding cautiously to the southward. Heavy losses occur annually from inat-
tention to this simple precaution. In May, 1863, for instance, of twelve liomeward-
bound vessels which had got involved in a revoh-ing storm by nnming to the
southward with increasing winds, falling barometer, and threatening weather, two
had to be abandoned at sea, and the others were so disabled that on arrivins' at

Port Louis some of them were condemned, and some detained for two or three

months undero-oing repairs. The loss on that single occasion must have amounted

to at least £60,000, and there is not the slightest doubt that it would have been

avoided if the vessels had kept back for a day or two, and not run headlong into

the storm. In the hurricane season, in those latitudes, with the wind anywhere

between north and south, through the west, the weather squally and threatening,

and the barometer falUng, a vessel should not press too much to the southward.

B}^ attention to this rule the storm will be avoided.

Experience has proved that the existence of a gale belonging to any one ot the

three classes above described is indicated at Mam-itius by the barometer, winds,

Aand weather, even when the distance is very considerable.                                                            trade-wind gale is

preceded by a high and rising barometer, and by the setting in of the wind at

southward, generally with a clear sky. On the other hand, the barometer at Mau-

ritius always falls during a gale belonging to either of the other two classes. As

a general rule, if the barometer fall steadily for three or four days to the extent of

even one-tenth of an inch below its height for the season, it may be inferred either

that a tropical gale exists on the equatorial borders of the trade-wind, or an extra-

tropical one on its  polar borders                                                               and  the  direction  and veering of  the wind, and
                                                                                              ;

the character of the clouds, will determine in which of these directions the

disturbance is taking place. At the setting in of a tropical gale awaj^ to the north-

ward or N.E., the trade-wind at Mauritius is drawn towards the locality of dimi-

nished pressure, and the barometer falls. When an extra-tropical gale takes place

away to the S.W., towards the Cape of Good Hope, the trade-wind is deflected

in that direction, so as to form a pai-t of the X.E. winds of the east side of the

gale, and in this case also the barometer falls at JMauritius, until the southerly winds

of the west side of the gale have begun to exert their influence, as the gale ad-
vances to the eastward. The existence of all the heavy gales which have taken

place in either direction, for some years back, has been known at Mauritius, and

frequently announced in the newspapers at the time.

           On Meteorological Observations at Sea. By F. "VV. Moffat.

                                               Communicated by Dr. Moffat.

These observations were made for the purpose of ascertaining the quantity of ozone

in different degi-ees of latitude and longitude at sea. The observations extend

between lat. 53° N. and 39° S., and long. 83° E. and 25° W. The author had ob-

served that as the wind veered with increasing readings of the barometer from south

points of the compass through west to north, ozone disappeared, and continued

absent while the wind was in points between north and east, and that it reap-

peared as the wind veered with decreasing readings of the barometer to south
points. The disappearance and reappearance of ozone with these conditions were

so regular that the changes appeared to be the result of an invariable atmo.spheric

law, and the author was induced to examine the law of the rotation of the wind,

so clearly developed by Dove, and the results of the examination led him to believe

that the polar current is the non-ozoniferous, or that of minimum of ozone, and

that the equatorial, or sea-wind, is the ozoniferous, or that of the maximum of

ozone. According to the rotation theory, the polar current in the northern he-

misphere forms the N.E " trade," and that in the southern hemisphere forms the

S.E. " trade," while the equatorials in the northern and southern hemispheres form

the upper or returning "trades." These returning "trades" come to the earth's

surface in both hemispheres about the 28th degree (the latitude varies with the

season), north and south of the equator. The author stated that if his deductions

are trustworthy, the N.E. and S.E. "trades" ought to be the minimum of ozone

cun-ents,  and the returning                   " trades"                                              the maximum of ozone currents                                                                                                                                                    that in the

as with the returning cun-ents. The author showed by tabulated results that such
was the case, and he expressed a belief that were it not for the modifying effects

of the trade-winds, ozone would be a constant quantity at sea.

     0)1 the Errors of Aneroids at various Pressures.

B>/ Balfour Stewart, LL.D., F.B.S., Superintendent of Keiv Observatory.

   At the request of tlie Meteorological Committee experiments have lately been

made at Kew Observatory, with the view of ascertaining to what extent an aneroid
may be considered as a reliable instrameut when exposed to considerable changes

of pressure, such as occur in moimtain ascents.
   In order to make these experiments, a large receiver had attached to it a standard

barometer, of which the accuracy had been previously ascertained. By means of
an air-pump, the aneroids, when placed in this receiver, might be subjected to any

jn-essure, the exact amount of pressure being noted by the standard barometer.

An arrauo-ement devised by Mr. Beckley, mechanical assistant at Kew, enabled the

aneroids to be tapped Avhile in the receiver, so as to imitate, as well as possible,

the tapping of the hand, to which these instruments are usually subj ected previous

to their readings being taken.

   For the aneroids, to which I shall immediately refer, observations were made for
every inch of pressure between 30 inches and 10 inches, ten minutes being occu-
pied in going troni one stage to the next, and the instruments being always tapped

at evei-y stage. When they had reached their lowest pressure, they were kept at this

for an hour and a half, and were then raised in stages of 1 inch every ten minutes
until the ordinary atmospheric pressure was finally reached. The instruments

themselves were obtained from the best-known makers, w^ho kindly lent aneroids

for the purpose of this experiment.

The  following  Table     denotes the  average  behaviour of these  instruments so
                                                                                                                                     _

treated, eight sets of experiments having been made, and the instruments being

one half large instruments, diameter 4 inches, and one half small instruments,

diameter 2 inches.
   Supposing the instruments were quite right at starting at the pressure of 30

inches, then their behaviour while the pressui'c was being lowered is represented

by the following Table :

standard barometer before begiuuino: our observations in order to ascertain its

index error, and if we then gradually increase tlie jjressiu'e, using- the above index
error, we shall find that the instrument lags behind, that is to say, reads too low

up to 24 inches, at which point its behaviour' appears to be reversed, and it there-

after rises too fast.

   2. The instrument is, however, tolerably accurate up to 25 inches, or through a

range of 6 inches.

   3" If we compare our aneroid -^-ith a standard at the end instead of the begin-
ning of the observations, we shall get much less reliable results.

   So much for the double experiment, in which the pressure is first lowered and

then raised.

   Now, if at the end of this experiment we compare our aneroid with a standard
once more at the ordinary pressure, we shall find that, on the whole, its indications

have fallen, or it reads too low, but graduallv, and in com-se of time, it recovers

itself.

   This is seen by the following instances :

   The experiments are not yet quite finished, but we may perhaps conclude

   1. That if a good 4-inch aneroid be first of all comi)ared with a standard baro-
meter, and then gradually subjected to a decrease of pressure, it will give reliable
results through a range of 6 inches.

   2. That if a good 4-iuch aneroid be first compared with a standard barometer
at a low pres.?m-e, and then gradually subjected to an increase of pressure, it will
give reliable results through a range of 6 inches, starting from the low pressure.

   3. The results would probably be still better if the instrimient, before use, were
compared with ?. standard barometer after the manner I have now described.

                 Storm-Warnings, their Importance and Practicahility.

                             By Colonel Stkes, M.R, F.E.S.

   The author adduced the testimony of nmuerous men of scientific eminence, and

the Keports from the seaports to the great importance of the signals lately in prac-

tice at the Meteorological Department of the Board of Trade, both from humane

and commercial points of view, and then stated that out of 405 warnings given in

three years, the prognostications were correct for 305 times. No one could tell the

possible number of li\-es and amount of property which had thus been saved ; and

he asked if this did not sufliciently justify the continuance of these storm-v.'arn-

ings, even thoiigli founded on supposed empirical data. The Scientific Committee
of the Royal Society had declined to continue these "warnings, on the ground tliat
Admiral FitzRoy had obtained his conclusions on empirical data. The author stated
that the Committee proposed to establish eight additional observatories througlmut
the empire ; and at the end of fifteen years they expected to be able to predict
storms on philosophical data, and not on empirical data. But if during the last
fifty years all the Observatories of the kingdom had not been able to obtain these
results, the author thought that they were not likely to do so during the next fif-
teen years, and the cost of ma'ntaining them would be wasted.

             On Evaporation from Rain-gauges. By JonN Thetjston.

                                   CHEMISTRY.

           Address hij tlie President, Thomas Anderson, M.D., F.R.S.E.

On many previous occasions the British Association has met in places which have

aflbrded the chemist valuable opportunities of seeing the principles of his science
reduced to practice, and the various papers which have been read at this Section on
these subjects, and the discussions which have arisen regarding them, have formed

a very interesting department of its proceedings. At the present Meeting little of
this is likely to engage our attention ; for though the manufactures of Dundee have
probably increased, during the last ten or fifteen years, in a more rapid ratio than
those of any other town in the kingdom, they have taken a direction which gives

but little scope for the applications of chemistry, so that -n-ith the exception of a
few of the simpler operations of the dyer, there is really scarcely anything which

need specially attract our attention. Under these circumstances it may be fairly
anticipated that the business of the Section will be more particularly occupied with

the discussion of the great principles of the science which to the general public
are often less interesting, and regarded as the exclusive province of those engaged
in scientific study, and not sufficiently recognized as being tlie only sure foundation
on which the superstructure of practical progress can be raised.

   The consideration of these general principles is, liowever, at the present moment

a matter of the very highest importance, for the science of chemistry is in a state

of transition. The immense accumulation of facts which has been made during
the last twenty or thirty years, has not only increased her bounds, but lias shown
the insufficiency of those principles on which the chemist was formerly ready to
rely -nath almost implicit confidence, and introduced changes amounting to a revo-
lution, which have had the eftect of unsettling the views formerly entertained,
without as yet introducing anything which can be considered satisfactory in their
place. The atomic theory, which at the commencement of the present century
explained with clearness and precision all the facts of the science then known, has
proved itself (at least in the form in which Dalton left it) no longer sufficient for
the purpose. At the time at which it was produced, the knowledge of chemists
was confined to a comparatively small number of compounds, among which those
of oxygen had so preponderating an importance that the science of the time might
almost be described as the chemistry of oxygen. At the present moment, if we
were to attach to it the name of any individual element, we should probably
describe the whole science by the definition which has been so often applied to

organic chemistry, and call it the chemistrj' of carbon, for it is in the study of the
compounds of that element that all the difficulties witli which the chemist has

now to contend have had their origin. At a comparatively early period indeed,

doubts were expressed as to the sufficiency of the atomic theory of Dalton, and
Ampere especially suggested that the chemical atom might with advantage be
considered to be a congeries of smaller particles ; but this and other analogous
additions to tlie original conceptions of the chemical atom, being of a purely specn-

lative character, and having no immediate bearing on the facts then, or even now
known, have never been accepted by chemists, or received fi'om them more than a
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  29

very passing notice, and were not unfairly considered to be unnecessary complica-

tions of tlie theory. It was left for time to accumidate facts, for wliicli Dalton's
theory supplied no explanation of any kind, and these were at first neglected ; but
as their number increased, their explanation was evaded by the invention of names
intended to group together facts supposed to be dependent on similar causes. Such
names as catalysis, allotropy, and the like, really explain nothing; they are little
better than scientific lumber-rooms, in which unexplained facts are stowed away
until it suits our knowledge or oiu' convenience to classify and exjilain them. I

am far from asserting that this mode of grouping facts supposed to have something

in common, has not its advantages, provided only it be distinctly imderstood that
it is the grouping of ignorance. The risk lies in the name bemg accepted as au

--explanation, and inquiry being thereby retarded and something of this sort has

indeed occurred ; for though these facts were admitted to be beyond the scope of

the atomic theory, they were quietly sat aside ; things went on as they were before,

and it was not till the introduction of the theory of atomicity, which shows itself
in every chemical fact, that the doubts which had been long gathering in the

minds of all thoughtful chemists, found distinct expression. I do not on the pre-

sent occasion propose to discuss in detail the effect which the introduction of this

view has had upon chemical theory, further than to remark that it renders it

necessary either to abandon altogether the atomic theory of Dalton, or to introduce

into it such modifications as fundamentally alter its entire character, and make it
substantialh' a new theory. The former is an alternative which some chemists
will be gTeatly disinclined to adopt. They will not willingly abandon a theory
which has admittedly done admirable service, which at its first introduction estab-
lished order and regularity where confusion and disorder previously reigned
supreme, and under whose influence the science has attained its present goodly
proportions. Others again may be of opinion that the atomic theory has done its
work, and in the future is less likely to act as an assistance than as a hindrance to

progress, by forcing us to consider all facts in its particular light, and causing us to
overlook relations which might be at once detected by an unbiassed mind.

   This latter opinion has been very strongly expressed by Sir Benjamin Brodie,
and in the Calculus of Chemical Operations, which he has recently made public,

we have the first systematic attempt which has been made to express the consti-

tution of chemical compounds by a method in which the idea of an atom has no
place. As this is the most important chemical doctrine which has been put
forward for many years, and must, if accepted, materiallj^ alter our present \iews,
I shall venture to consider it in some detail, premising, however, that as only the
first part of the investigation has yet been made public, any opinion I may now

express regarding it may be liable to modification when the entire investigation is

published.

    Sir B. Brodie, as has been already observed, discards altogether the idea of an
atom, and compares with one another the weights of diflerent substances in the
gaseous state which are capable at the standard temperature and pressure of filling

a unit of space, which is the bulk of 1000 cubic centimetres. If we consider this

space to be empty, and fill it with hydrogen, a chemical operation is performed
which is represented by the symbol a, expressing the fact that the weight so intro-

duced is chemically indivisible. If now in place of hydrogen oxygen be introduced,

the unit of space is filled by a quantity sixteen limes as great, but this weight is

not indivisible, as is at once apparent if we notice what happens when oxygen is

introduced into the unit of space ah'eady fiUed with hydrogen. In that case a
second operation is performed on it, in which a weight eight times as great as that
of the hydrogen is introduced, and water is the result. The quantity of oxygen
which fills the unit of space must therefore be regarded as divisible," and this is
expressed by assigning to it the symbol ^^,, indicating the fact that two identical

operations are required to fill the unit of space with oxygen. By the same line of

argument it is concluded that sulphur, selenium, &c., miist be similarly constituted,
and they are accordingly represented respectively by 6.,, X,, &c. So far it will be
observed that the system is merely a modification of that at present used by che-
mists for expressing the laws of gaseous combination, excepting that all substances,
compounds as well as elements, are referred to the unit of space, while, according
30 REPORT-- 1867.

to our present plan, the former are referred to two units of space and the latter to
one. But when the compounds of chloriue and tlie allied elements, with hydrogen,

are to he represented according to Sir B. Brodie's system, it at once becomes appa-

rent that some further hypothesis must he introduced if they are to be referred to

the same volume. When the quantity of hydrogen represented by the symbol a,

unites with chlorine, the product fills itwo units of space, and as, according- to the

fundamental hypothesis, a is indivisible, the question is to obtain some means of

expressing without fractions the quantity of hydrochloric acid which fills the unit

of space. This end Sir Benjamin attains by assuming that chlorine is itself a com-
poimd of hydrogen with an unknown element to which the symbol x is assigned;
clilorine being n;^',, and formed by three operations, one being hydrogen, and the

other two which are identical, result in the introduction into the. unit of space of

two quantities of a h^i^othetical substance x, whose weight is 17-25 : and according
to this view, when hydrogen and chloriue unite, the action is expressed by the

equation

                       _        + =. ax., a 2ax.

On  precisely the         same  principle  iodine,  bromine,  nitrogen,  phosphorus,  antimony,

and bismuth must alsoije hydrogen compounds. It is obvious therefore that Sir

Benjamin's system involves a very large amount of hypothesis ; for it assumes that
a considerable number of those substances hitherto regarded as elements are really

compounds. I do not imagine that much difficulty will be experienced by any

one in admitting the possibility of this, for I apprehend there is no chemist who
imagines those bodies which we call elements to be the ultimate constituents of
matter, or who doubts that the time, though still far distant, will come when they
may be resolved into simpler substances. But when we come to reduce the.se

specidations to a definite form, and seek to make them part of the science itself, it
becomes essential to subject them to a very close and searching scrutiny.

In order to justify their assumption, it seems to me necessary either that they

should be supported by experimental evidence, or that they should afford the means

of tracing out unsuspected relations, and thus extending the bounds of the science,

or, at all events, that they should involve the minimum amount of hypothesis.
Now, as regards the first of these, it is unnecessary to observe that there "is not one

tittle of evidence to show that chlorine is a compound any more than hydrogen
itself. As far as extending the bounds of the science is concerned, we must look

for an answer to the future, and it may be expected that in the remaining parts of

the invesrigation, which it is to be hoped may soon be made public, it will be
shown how the method may be used for this puqiose ; but, in the meantime, I am
unable to see how it is to open up new fields of inquiry, and it is certain that it

leaves unexplained all those anomalies which are usually considered to be the weak

pointsof the existing system. Neither can it be asserte'd that the system involves

the minimum amount of hypothesis ; for, in point of fact, the assumption of the

compound nature of certain of the elements is rendered necessary by the funda-

mental h}i5othesis that a is indivisible. If it be assumed to be divisible, "tlie necessity

fin- holding those elements to be compound at once falls to the ground, and I confess

it appears to me that we should require very clear evidence of the advantages it
offers before we accept a hypothesis invoh-ing so many others. The question must

at best be considered as still sub judice, and the method is not lilcely to meet with

general acceptance tmtil it is supported by a much larger body of facts than those
we at present have.

   While Sir B. Brodie's theory is one from which the idea of atoms is excluded, it

is important to notice that it is by no means incompatiljle with th.em, and it even

appears to me that though it may suit our convenience to consider n.atter in rela-

tion to space only, the real subject of inquiry is not the unit of space, but the unit

of matter, and to it we must eventually come. If I hold, as I moFt xmdoubtedly

do, that the atomic theory of Diilton must sooner or later be abandoned, it is not

because I do not believe in the existence of a unit of matter. Whether we assume

it to be a hard spherical particle, a centre of force, or a vortex produced in a per-

fect ether, is another question ; but it seems evident that some kind of molecidar

hypothesis is indispensable for the explanation of physical phenomena, and it is

scarcely possible to doubt that some connexion must" exist between the chemical
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  31

and the physical unit of matter. In the mean time it is onlj- by the most cumhrona
and improbable assumptions that the existing atomic theoiy can be made to fit in
with the facts which chemistry has recently discovered, and of these the theory of
atomicity is one which can scarcely be connected with it at all. In point of fact

tliat theory is a merely temporary hypothesis, constructed to keep before our eyes
the tendency which substances have to form compounds of certain definite forms,
under special circumstances ; and it is scarcely possible to doubt, that in twenty or

tliirtv years it will have passed away and have been replaced by something- of a
more satisfactory character. ^Meanwhile its important influence ou the recent pro-

gress of chemistiT is too obvious to be disputed. It is only to be regretted that so

many conflicting "modes of considering the atomicities of the elements should have

been introduced by different vniters.
   Info tlie consideration of this matter I should have been glad to have entered at

some length, but I feel that I have already detained you too long from the actual

business of tlie Section, and no doubt opportunities will arise in the course of the
business for individuals expressing their opinions on this and other subjects.

Among these the mode of expressing the sjTubols of chemical compounds, which

was objected to long since by Sir John Herschel, and has been again brought into
liromiuence by the publication of Sir B. Brodie's paper, merits attention. The

present vmsettled state of chemical nomenclature, so inconvenient to the teacher,

ought also to he discussed, and it might even be well to consider whether a com-

mittee should not be appointed to ascertain how far it might be possible to adopt
a uniform system. Nor do I think we ought to separate without recording our

opinion on "the subject of better and more extendjed scientific education. The

events of the Paris Exhibition have brought our deficiencies in this respect very

conspicuously before us, and show, us how much we have yet to do. That we
have made progress in this respect is not to be doubted, for science is much more
cultivated now than formerly, and is becoming more and more a branch of general

education. J.luch, however, still remains to be done in this direction, especially in

Scotland, and it will no doubt surprise many of my audience to hear that chemistry

and natiu'al history are still excluded from the course of study for degrees in arts
in the Scotch miiversities. Of late years the study of these and other departments
of natural science has been introduced to some extent in schools both in England

and Scotland ; but, so far as my experience goes, vrithout having as yet produced

results of much importance. The difficulty, I think, lies in the kind of instruction

offered ; the usual practice having been to give lectures from which the discussion
of principles and of everything which exercises and devqlopes the mind, is elimi-
nated, and only that which it is supposed will entertain or sui-prise is retained, and
boys are thus led to look upon science merely as a pastime. They are slirewd
enough to see the difference between this and the closer and more severe system
of study pursued in the other departments of their education, and they are apt
either to avoid work altogether, or to acquire their knowledge in a superficial

manner. The whole sj-stem of teaching science to school-boys is a subject which
merits far more attention tlian it has yet received, and the success of the move-

ment must gi'eatly depend on an efficient method of teaching being adopted. All

these, however, are subjects the discussion of which would carry me far beyond

the limits of tliose introductory observations with which it has been customary to

open the business of the Section. It must be left for its members to bring forward
their own views on these and kmdred questions.

rated his objections to the system. 1st. That the assumption of the distiihutive

law of multiplication is unnecessary, and leads moreover to the anomalous result

that the same direct operation does not always produce equal results when per-

=formed on the two sides of an equation, thus x+i/  uy                 hut  multiplying both

tion (for Avhich no evidence is produced) that the unit of hydi-ogen is a simple

weight, leads to inconvenient formulte, the symbol a being used to express not

only the quantity of hydrogen in a substance, but also what those chemists, who
use atomic language, would call the number of perissad atoms. 3rd. That a system

of notation substantially the same in furm as that at present in use might be de-

duced from Sir Benjamin Brodie's principles, upon the more reasonable convention
that bodies hitherto uudecomposed ai-e not to be represented as compound. The

ordinary chemical symbols might therefore be used in a fimctional as well as in an

atomic sense.

 A Note on Messrs. WanMyn, Cha/nnan, and Sinith's mefJiod of determining

    Nitroc/enoiis Organic Matters in Water. By Uugald Campbell, F.C.S.

   At the meeting of the Chemical Society on June 20, Messrs. Wanklyn, Chap-
man, and Smith proposed to determine the nature and amoimt of the nitrogenous
organic matters contained in di-inking waters by the anioimt of ammonia given oft'
wlien a given quantity of the water was distilled rapidly -^-ith the addition of cer-

tain weights of different reagents added at diflerent parts of the distillation, the
reagents being carbonate of soda, caustic potash, and permanganate of potash.

Their experiments lead to the conclusion that when a liti-e of water is distilled
·nith two gi-ammes of carbonate of soda, all the nitrogen of tlie m-ea existing in the
water will practically be found as ammonia in the first .300 c. c. distilled over, and
that none of the nitrogen existing in albumen or " albuminoid" matters, which may

be in the water, woiild be evolved as ammonia.
   Experiments were made with pure distilled water containing respectively ^V)

jV) iV> ^^^ To7 parts of a grain of urea in a gallon, and in every case nitrogen
remained in the water after distillation with the carbonate of soda, and was evolved

by other means and estimated; and it was only when the -^l-^ part of a giaiu of
urea, or less, was dissolved in a gallon of water that the urea was entii'ely decom-
posed by carbonate of soda and evolved as anmionia.

   Experiments were likewise made with white of new-laid egg equal to -^^, ^g,
JO! aud yjo part of a grain of dry albumen dissolved in a gallon of nure dis-
tilled water, distilling one litre of each solution vdih two gi-ammes of cai'oonate of
soda ; in eveiy case distinct quantities of ammonia were evolved and estimated,
and in the last experiment, with white of egg equal to the -^l-^ part of a grain
of diT albumen per gallon, practically, all the ammonia in the albumen was evolved,
there" being a loss of only 0000017 gi'ain, a quantity so small as ^o be attributable

to an error in obsei-vatiou or otherwise.

   In all the experiments the ammonia was estimated by Nessler's test.

in cases where a continuous register is reqvured of the acidity of the air which
passes along a flue or chimney. It is a continuous and self-acting aspirator, which
draws a measured quantity of air from the flue or chimney through absorption-
bottles, and registers the amount so drawn.

   It consists, first, of a small fan three inches in diameter. This is placed in an

opening? made in the side of the flue or chimney. The draught of air entering by
this hole gives revokition to the fan, and tlience, by means of an endless screw and
toothed wheel, to a crank which moves a bellows-pump. This draws air from the
flue or chimney by means of a tube inserted through the brickwork, and causes it

On an Ether Anemometerfor Measurinri the Speed of Air in Flues and Chimneys.

                                     Bij A. E. Elktcher, F.'O.S.

    This instrument is contrived for measuring the speed of air in pipes, flues or
chimneys in cases where, from the presence of heat, soot, or corrosive vapour, a
delicate mechanism would be inadmissible. It has been called an ether-anemo-
metei-, since ether is employed in its construction ; by it the speed of air moving

at any greater rata than that of nine inches per second can be measured.

   The principle employed in its construction is in part that of the Gifford's injectoi',
·wherein a current of steam passing the open end of a tube is made to produce a

partial vacuum in it.
   In the current of air whose velocity is to be measured, is placed a glass or metal

tube with a plain straight end, and along with it a tube whose end is bent at right
angles and cut off short. This bent end is turned to face the current, while the
straight tube is so exposed to the current that it passes along its open end. The

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   _

difference of pressure in these two tubes will then be a measure of the velocity of
the cm-rent. The pull or suction of the chimney will be the same in each.

   To measure this difference of pressure, which for slow currents is very small,
many methods were tried until the present form of apparatus was adopted. It is

but a modification of the U-tube;'the limbs are cylinders of three inches in dia-

meter and four inches in length, connected at the bottom by a small horizontal

tube. The liquid used is ether, on account of its low specific gra-s-ity aud its mo-

bility. In each limb is a hollow metal float, scribed with a fine line. The level of

these lines is read off" by a finely divided scale and vernier adjusted by fine screws.

It is easy to read to ygVo i^ch, and therefore to measure a pressure which is balanced

by  a  column     of ether    Jg-j^  inch  high.
                            ^

' In order to learn how to connect the readings of the instrument with the speed

of the air operating on it, it was determined not to depend on calculation only, but

to test it against currents of air of known speeds. For this purpose a pipe was con-

structed fourteen inches diameter and 100 feet long, one end being in connexion

with a tall chimney, the other one open. At the open end a hot brick was placed,

and at a given sig'nal a drop of sulphuric acid was allowed to fall upon it. The

cloud of vapour thus raised passed along the pipe, and its arrival at the distant end

was observed on looking through two holes bored for the purpose. The time was

noted by a watch held to the ear. Having thus ascertained by two or three trials

the speed of the' air, readings from the ether-anemometer were taken. The speed

was then altered by means of a slide or damper, and measured again by noting

accurately the time taken by the cloud of vapour in travelling tlie 100 feet, and a

fresh reading of the anemometer registered. In this way a Table was made enr-

bracing the greatest range of speed obtainable by the chinmey.

   It was clear from the law of bodies in motion, that this should obey the formula

= = =p v-Xc; where;; the indication of tlie instrument, v velocity of the current,

and c some constant influenced by the individual details of the instrument. From

the    series of  experiments        thus made, the value of  c was found  to be  25-31                             with
                                                                                                                 :

this a complete table of the values of ;j from 0001 inch to 1-000 inch was calculated.

    The instrument is found to be very satisfactory and reliable in its indications.
AIt may also serve as a wind-gauge.
                                                       plain piece of iron gas- pipe projecting

vertically above the roof of the hou'se or observatory, should communicate with

one limb of the ether-anemometer. As the wind blows over the open end of this
                                                                                                                     An
pipe,  a  partial  vacuum   would          be  formed  and  measured  by the  instrument.
                                                                                                                    _

advantage of tliis arrangement over the wind-gauges at present in use would lie in

the absence of all moving parts whose friction might vary, and which might pos-

sibly be deranged.                                                                3

invented for tliis pm-pose could he emploj-ed only under tlio ordinary pressiu'e of
one atmosphere, and left untouched the relation established by Dr. Heniy and Dal-
ton bet\Yeen absorption and pressure. Ijatelj' Messrs. Roscoe, Ditmar, and Sinims

have made very interesting investigations on the absorption of some highly absorb-
able gases, and showed that the law of Henry and Dalton is only exact for elevated
temperatures. That was the reason which induced mj^ friend Dr. Louguinine and
myself to undertake a new series of experiments on a gas not so absorbable as

--those investigated by Messrs. Eoscoe, Ditmar, and Siimns namely, on carbonic

acid gas.

   Before all it was absolutely necessary to construct an apparatus which should
not have the above-mentioned imperfections of the apparatus of our celebrated
predecessor Dr. Henry. It was evident that it must consist of a glass vessel ex-
actly gauged and arranged in such a manner as to be easily put in connexion with
a large manometer, and separated from it in a very short time. Secondlj', the
absorption must be produced, not by shaking the apparatus by the hand, but by
moving it mechanically in a space with an invariable temperature. The first re-
quirement was easily obtained by luting to the open end of om- absorption-bell an
iron tube with a cork, and the second by takin^ the precaution of making the con-
tact of tlie absorbing liquid and the absorbable gas very perfect bj' revolving the
glass vessel, containing the liquid aud the gas, in a gi'eat mass of water, maintained
constantly at the same temperature. These are the two principal difterences between
oiu' apparatus and those of our predecessors ; and without entering into more details
on om- experiments, executed at the College de France in the laboratory of M. Keg-
nault, I pass directly to the results we obtained for carbonic acid gas, and at the

temperatiu-e of 15° C. or 58° F.

   If we designate by u^ the coefficient of absorption of a given gas under the pres-
sure Pj, and by «o the coefficient of the same kind, but under a higher pressure V^,

In spite of some small anomalies presented by these mmibers, it is evident that the
difl'erence a -bis constantly increasing with tlie pressure, so that this discrepancy
-with the law of Henry and Dalton caimot be ascribed exclusively to the inevitable

errors of observation.

   From the monient that the carbonic acid gas was liquefied, it was evident that
its coefficient of absorption by liquids must be zero for two dift'ercnt pressiu-es.

First, for a pressure of nearly zero ; and second, for the pressure which reduced
the gas, at a given temperature, to a liquid state. But if so, it was also evident
that the relation between the coefficient of absorption and the pressure could not
ba a simple algebraical and lineal function of these variables, as it was supposed
l)y Henry aud Dalton, but that this relation could be more nearly expressed by

                                 a = A-t-BP-hCP2,

which for «=:0 nuist give two positive and real values for P, and also

values :

          A= -0-13259174 with mean probable errors for A=4-0-0152094G

          C = - 0-01982625 with mean probable errors for C = +0-00283004.

  These values of A, B, and C being put in the equation « = 0, give us the two nume-

rical expressions of P, which render the coefficient of absorption equal to zero,

namely, P = 0-109 atm. and P = 6ri44 atm. At the same timewe see that a, becomes

a maximum for P=:30-66 atm., and that for this pressure it will be nearly 18 times

=greater than when P =1. The value of P 61 atm. is evidently the pressure required

for the liquefaction of carbonic acid gas at the temperature of 15° C, and we have
no direct experiments for the verification of this number ; but if we take the ob-

servations of M. Regnault on tlie points of ebullition of liquid carbonic acid gas at

Preliminary Notice of Results on the Composition of Wheat groivn for twenty

   i/ears in succession on the same Land. By J. B. Lawes, I'^.Ii.S., F.O.S., and

   J. H. GiLBER-r, Ph.D., F.R.S., F.C'.S.

   These results had reference to the produce of a field in which wheat had now

been gi-own, on some plots without niautn-e, on one with farm-3-ard mantire, and
on others by different artificial mixtures, for twenty-four years in succession
(1843-4 to 1866-7 inclusive). At the Cheltenham Meeting of the British Asso-
ciation in 1856, the authors treated of the effects of season and manures on the
composition of thw crop as illustrated by the results of analysis relating to the
 .roduce of some of the plots during the first ten years of the experiments*. At the

Ilancliester Meeting, in 1861, they recurred to the subject; the analytical results,

wliicli then extended to the produce of some of the plots for sixteen years, were,
however, chieflv applied to the illustration of certain points in connexion with the
exhaustion of soils. At the Nottingham JNIeeting, in 1866, they treated of the
acciunulation of the nitrogen of manure in the soil of the same experimental field.
The restdts adduced on the present occasion showed the eftects of season and
manuring on the composition of both the gi-ain and the straw during twenty years
of the experimental growth.

   The particulars of composition given are--the percentages of dry substance,

of mineral matter, and of nitrogen, and the constituents of the ash of both grain
and straw, more than 200 complete ash-analyses being brought to bear on the
subject; and, side by side with these, as indicating the general characters of the

produce of the different seasons and plots, are given the propoitiou of corn to

straw, and tlie weight per bushel of the corn.
   In the case of the plots without manure, with farm-yard manure, and with

ammonia-salts alone, e-^ery year, the ash of the grain of the last sixteen, or more,
and of the straw of the last sixteen, of the twenty years, had been analyzed ; and in

the case of nine differently manured plots (including the aboYC three), the ash, of
both corn and straw, of the ffrst, the last, and two intermediate seasons (one bad
and one good) of the last twelve of the twenty years had been analyzed. It was

the intention of the authors to publish the results of the investigation in detail
before long ; and on the present occasion they confined attention to a few of the
most prominent effects of the respective manures on the composition of the crop,

when thus applied for so long a continuance, year after j'ear, on the same plot.
   It is first pointed out as remarkable, though fully established by their results

from the commencement, that variation in manure, even though maintained for

many years in succession, and resulting in great variation in amount of produce,

affects' comparatively little either the proportion of corn to straw, or the weight
per bushel of the corn ; excepting, indeed, in a few extreme cases of abnormal
exhaustion or repletion. Nor do the percentages of dry substance, of mineral

matter in dry substance, or of nitrogen in dry substance, vary much under the

direct influence of variation in manure, unless again in very abnomial cases.

Very different, however, is the effect of season ; the variation in the character of
the produce, in every one of the above particulars, being much greater in different
seasons with the same manure, than with different manures in the same season.

    Consistently with these broad facts, the composition of the ash of the grain is

found to be pretty imiform under a great variety of manuiial conditions in one and
the same season ; only in a few extreme cases, of special interest, varying in any

material degree. The same may be said in some, though in a much less degree,
of the composition of the ash of the straw, which is obviously much more directly

affected bj- the character of the supplies within the soil.

The general result is that (excepting in a few abnormal cases), the variation in

the composition of the ash of the grain is limited to the slight variations due to

dilfercnces of development] and maturation, which, in their turn, are much

greater with variation of season than with variation of manure. The composition

of the ash of the straw, on the other hand, much more nearly represents the total

mineral matters taken up by the plant, and much less the character of development

of its own more fixed and essential constituents. In other words, whilst there

may be considerable range in the composition of the matters taken up by the

entire plant, the tendency in the formation and ripening of the ultimate product,

the seed (whether produced in small quantities or large), is to a fixed and uniform

composition, the deviation fi-om which is little directly affected by the character of

the supplies -^dthin the soil, but much more by the various inffuences of season.

The deviations from the point of fixed and uniform composition, thus due pri-

marily to variations in climatic circumstance, are, howe^·er, when considered in

relation to other characters of the grain, sufficient to show the general connexion

between the comparative predominance of individual constituents and that of
Acertain general characters of development.
                                             few illustrations were gi\'en, but the

fuUer treatment of the subject, in its bearing on these as well as on other points,

was reseiTcd until the results could be considered in the detail necessary to their

proper elucidation.

   One point of interest prominently brought out by the results relating to the
composition of the straw-ash was, that a high percentage of silica was almost

uniformly associated with a bad, and a low percentage with a good condition of

the prodtice ; a fact to which the authors had on former occasions called attention,
but which, as was remarked by the President, was quite inconsistent with the

generally accepted views on the subject.

                      On the present Uses of Lichens as Bye-stuffs.

             By W. Lauder Lindsay, lil.D., F.E.S. Edinb., F.L.S.

   The paper treats of tlie subject vmder two principal heads, viz. :

   I. The Commercial Dye-liclieus and Licheu-dj'es : and
   II. The Domestic Dye-lichens and Lichen-dyes.

  When the aniline colours were introduced some years ago, technologists pre-

dicted with confidence the rapid disuse of lichen-dyes, on the ground of the supe-
rior beauty and permanence, as well as abundance and cheapness, of the former. lu

like manner, many years ago, scientiiic authorities Tentiu-ed to assert that if there

lingered then in the more remote corners or less accessible districts of Scotland

--any vestige of the domestic or home-use of lichens as dye-stuffs a practice which
--at one time largely prevailed such a rude procedure or custom would speedily

disappear before the march of civilization, the penetration of the Highlands by
railways, the establishment of regular steam commimication between Edinburgh
or Glasgow and the western and northern islands, the cheapening and multipli-
cation of coal-tar and other dye-stuffs, and of the printed goods (woollen and
cotton) of Glasgow and Manchester, Havrick, and Leeds. Investigations made
in the course of collecting materials for a work on British Lichenology, in pre-
paration by the author (including the results of an examination of the Inter-
national Exhibitions of London and Paris, an inspection of the orchill manufactory
of Messrs. Burton and Garraway of Bethnal Green, London, and of a tour through

the Hebrides, Orkney, and Shetland in May and June 18G6) have led him to the

conclusion that all such predictions or assertions, whether regarding lichens as
commercial or domestic dye-stuffs in England and Scotland, are at least premature,

and that there is abundant evidence of a long future of usefulness for lichen dye-

                             I. Commercial Dye-lichens and Lichen-dyes,

--the author's chief propositions are the following :

1. French colorisis especially appear to have devised new processes for ensuiing
  permanence of lichen-dyes, whereb}' they can now c^uite compete in this

respect with the aniline colours, to wliicli they have never been inferior hi

   point of beautJ^

2. New forms of lichen-dyes have been patented ; especially combinations of

orchill liijuor, or its equivalent, with alkalies or earths in the form of lakes,

whereof the most familiar and important is that known as "i^;-tv(c/t ;;!«7;/c,"

the patent of Messrs. G uinon. Mamas, and Bonnet of Lyons, by whom it was

exhibited in London in 1SG2.

3. While the older dye-lichens have gradually been given up, new and more

valuable tinctorial species have been introduced : or the use of some of those

which were at one time little familiar, has now become greatly extended.

Manufacturers now import  almost     exclusively the Itoccdlec                                                                                          and for the  moat

   8. It is impossible to foretell or estimate the colorific value of any given new sam-
       ple of " orchella weed " by any tests or series of chemical or other experiments

       on the small scale. It can be determined only by manufacture on the large scale
        and as this is an experiment that necessarily involves the risk of heavy pecu-
      niary loss, it is not surprising that new materials and new processes are
        accepted or adopted with unusual tardiness or caution.
    9. The substitution, as an article of import, of the colorijic principles for the
       bulky dye-lichens themselves has not yet been adopted by manufacturers,
       though recommended strongly by chemists.

  --10. New commercial sources of valuable tinctorial Roccellce have been discovered
          new markets opened up. Then- present chief geogi-aphical sources are,

                                            1. Africa and its islands.
                                          2. South America ; and
                                            3. India and its islands.

   11. The commercial som-ces of " orcheUa weeds " of the finest quality may yet be

       greatly Inultiplied, and are so far from being exhausted, that they cannot yet
       be said to be fully developed or discovered.
   12. The only visible effect of competition -w-ith other dye-stuffs has been greatly .
       to reduce the market value of ''orchella-weeds."

  -- --13. Nevertheless, tlieir products French purple, orchill, and cudbear are suc-

       cessfully competing with the aniline, and all other colours, of their class

         hitherto introduced.

   14. So far from being superseded, the import of dye-lichens and manufacture of

      lichen-dyes in Europe is, perhaps, now more extensive and more flourishing

       than at any previous period.
   15. The manufacture of lichen-dyes in this country has not reached perfection

       and if with all their imperfections of manufactui'e they can successfully com-

      pete with aniline, whose preparation and applications are much more highly
      scientific, they have little reason to fear competition in the future, when

       applied chemistry shall have lent its aid to their proper production and

         applications.

   Under the head of

                               II. Domestic Dye-lichens and Lichen-dyes,

--the author's chief propositions arc as follow :

 --1. The domestic use of lichen-dyes is prevalent over whole districts in Scotland,
          even in and around large seaports, which have steam commimication with
       Glasgow or Edinburgh, sometimes two or three times a week (e. rj. Stornoway),
      and which may be presumed therefore to be well supplied with the cheapest
       and most abundant products of British manufacture.
   2. In the outer Hebrides (Lewis and Harris) " Crottle * " {Parmelia saratilis)

       is universally used in the dyeing of

                                    a. " Kelt," a home-made cloth.
                                        b. Stockings and socks.

                                         c. Polkas and scarfs.
                                        d. Hearthrugs and other articles.

   3. The articles of clothing so dyed are disposed of hi/ barter to the merchants

   * The term " Crottle " or " Crotal" is also applicable generically to dye -lichens. AVith
various descriptive prefixes, it has been, or is, applied in different p.irls of the United
Kingdom to otlier species of Parinelia, as well as to species of other genera, e.g., to

                   --ParmeUa saxatilis, var. omphalodes black crottle.
                   --P. pkysodes dark crottle.

    4. Cudbear is also largely used in the same islands (Lewis and Harris), being

        imported from southern markets via Glasgow.
   5. In Caithness and Sutherland a similar use is made of "Crottle," Thurso

       being the market and seaport to which the home-dyed produce is consigned

          h]i barter.

   G. Similar use is made of " Crottle " and other lichens {e. g. Lecanora tartarea,

       jRamalina scojmlortmi, Stida pulmonacea^, in Lochaber, Badenoch, and other
        parts of the Scottish Highlands.
   7. The process of dyeing varies greatly in different districts, ammoniacal mace-
       ration being apparently imknown in "the Hebrides, while it is or was generally
        adopted in the central Highlands.
   The conclusion of the paper is occupied with obseryations on the present unsa-

tisfactory character or condition of

   1. The cliemistnj of lichens, and more especially of the lichen-dj^es.
   2. The lichen-exhibitions in our national Museums ; and

works of reference Botanical and Chemical.

   In regard to the iirst subject of complaint, he advocates a new series of re-

searches to be undertaken cmijointhj by conqjctent chemists and lichenologists, so that

the one may assist or correct the investigations of the other : in reference to the

second, a systematic arrangement, by competent lichenologists and chemists, with
proper periodic supervision and rearrangement; and as concerns the third, the
consultation, by compilers, of original recent works of research instead of repe-
tition at second hand of the obsolete notions and errors of the earlier authors.

On a Comj^oimd formed by the direct union of Aldehyde and Anhydrous Prussic

    Acid. By Maxwell SuiPSON, M.D., F.B.S., and A. Gautiee, M.D.

The synthesis of alanin from aldehydate of ammonia, prussic and hydrochloric

acids, and the formation of lactic acid by the action of the same acids upon alde-

hyde, render highly probable the existence of an intermediate body, resulting from

the direct union of prussic acid and aldehyde, the formation of which constitutes
the first phase in these reactions. It is this body which forms the subject of the

present paper.

If one molecule of anhydrous hydrocyanic acid be added to one molecule of dry

aldehyde, contained in a balloon surrounded with a freezing mixture, the two

liquids mix without combining chemically, and their chemical combination is not
accelerated by heating at 100° C. If, however, we lea"\"e them in contact for ten

or twelve days at the ordinary temperature of the air, they gradually unite, form-

ing a perfectly transparent and colourless liquid. On subjecting this to distillation,

it was observed that hardly a drop passed over under 100° ; a small quantity be-

tween 160° and 174°, and the remainder of the liquid between 174° and 185° C.

On redistilling the latter portion it was found that the greater part passed over at
Aabout 183° C.
                considerable quantity, however, came over between 40° and 60°,

consisting principally of the parent bodies, which had been dissociated by the

simple vaporization of the liquid. On leaving these bodies thus dissociated once

more in contact for some days, the point of ebullition rose as before to 183* C.

                * The liquid was distil ed with great rapidity.

These anatyses prove that the body in question results from the direct combina-

tion of one molecule of aldehyde and one molecule of prussic acid, or at least of

equal numbers of molecules of these bodies, and that its point of ebullition is inter-

Wemediate between 180° and 184°.                have tried the above experiments on mix-

tures containing the two generating bodies in various proportions, but always with

the production of the same compound. The name we propose for this body is

cyannydrate of aldehyde, which is simply fomided upon its synthetical formation.

  Proj'crtics.  The cyanhydrate of aldehyde is a colom-less liquid, having a faint

odour of its generators ; it has a bitter and acrid taste ; it does not crystallize at

-- 21° C, but becomes syrupy. It can bear the temperature of 150° for a considerable

time without sufi'ering' decomposition ; at 180°, however, slight dissociation com-

mences, and the liquid must be rapidly distilled in order to avoid the loss of a

considerable quantit}\ It is soluble in all proportions in water and alcohol. It

may be heated with water in a sealed tube to 150° without suffering- the slightest

decomposition, and the entire liquid can be recovered by distillation. Caustic pot-

ash appears to separate it into its two generators, forming cyanide of potassium
Aand resin of aldehyde.
                         little ammonia is also evolved, owing probably to the

decomposition of the cyanide of potassium.

Gaseous ammonia is absorbed by cyanhydrate of aldehyde, with the production

of a base, which gives a precipitate with bichloride of platinum. Our analyses of

this salt have not yet enabled us to ascertain the composition of the base.

  A strong solution of hydrochloric acid acts with great violence at tlie ordinary

temperature of the air upon cyanhydrate of aldehyde. If, however, the cyanhj-drate

be introduced into a balloon surrounded by a freezing mixture, and the hydrochloric

acid be added gradually, the two liquids mix without any reaction taking place.

On removing the balloon from the freezing mixture and placing it in water at the

ordinaiy temperature, the reaction soon commences, and proceeds gradually till the

entire liquid becomes a mass of crystals. These were twice treated with absolute

alcohol in order to separate the chloride of ammonium which is formed. On eva-

porating the alcoholic solution a syrupy liquid was obtained, which was saturated

at 100*^ with pure oxide of zinc and tiftered. The filtered liquid gave, on cooling,

a mass of beautiful prismatic ci-j-stals. These were reci-j'staUized, heated in an

oil-bath to 150' C, and analyzed. The numbers obtained prove that the body in

question was the lactate of zinc, as will be seen from the following Table :

   The following equation explains the formation of this acid :

                 CJI.O, HCN-|-HCH-2(I1,0) = C3H,,0 -|-NH^Ch

The insolubility of this salt in alcohol, its non-decomposition at ]50°, and its crys-
talline form, suttiiiently prove that the acid combined with the zinc was the lactic
acid of fermentation, and not the sarcolactic.

   The behaviour of cj-anhjalrine of aldehyde towards hydrochloric acid and caustic
potash, proves that it is isomeric and not identical with the cyanhydrine of glycol
discovered by VVisliccniuB.

  We have endeavoured to obtain the vapour-density of this body by Dumas's

method, but without success. On heating the balloon containing om- body to.
210° in an oil-bath, we observed, on removing it from the bath, that the aldehyde
had been converted into a resin. On deducting its weight from the weight of the

balloon, the density of the vapour approached very near that of prussic acid. It
appears to us, however, to be sufficiently proved that this compound contains only

oue molecule of eacli of tlio parent bodies, from the fact that it gives lactic acid
with hydrochloric acid^ and that it separates by the action of heat into prussic acid
and ordinary aldehj'dc, and not into a polymer of aldehyde such as elaldehyde or
paraldehyde.

   The cyauhydrate of aldehyde is, in our opinion, a very striking example of an
organic compound which the temperatm'e of vaporization decomposes, and the

prolonged action of time reconstructs.

          On the Formation of Succinic Acid from Chloride of Ethylidene.

                          By Maxwell Simpson, M.D., F.li.S.

   Some years ago * I ascertained that when bromide of ethylene is successively

treated with cyanide of potassium and caurtic potash, ordinary succinic acid is
formed. This reaction has since been confirmed by M. Geuther t, who, however,
emplo3^ed chloride instead of bromide of ethylene.

   It occurred to me that it would be interesting to ascertain v.^hether the chloride
of eth3didene would, when subjected to the same treatment, produce the same or
an isomeric acid. One would naturally e>:pect the latter result, seeing that the

constitution of the chloride of ethylidene is different from that of the chloride of

ethylene. The following formulce will make this intelligible, and show the pro-

bable constitution of the isomeric acid :

              Chloride of        Cyanide of   Isomeric acid,
              ethylidene.
                                 ethylidene.

It is to be observed that in the transformation of cyanide of ethylene into ordi-

OOOHnary succinic acid, the group  takes the place of each eqiuvalent of cyanogen.

In the transformation of cj'auide of ethylidene, it is to be supposed · that the

cyanogen is replaced in a similar manner, with the formation of an isomeric acid.

In order to determine this point, 1 made the following experiments :

A mixture of oue equivalent of pure chloride of ethyle chlore, which is ideutical

with the chloride of ethylidene, two equivalents of pm'e cj'anide of potassium, and

a large quantity of alcohol was exposed in a sealed matrass for twenty-seven hours

to a temperatui'e ranging between 100° and 180° Cent. I had previously ascer-

tained that a high temperature was necessary in order to produce a reaction. At

the expiration of the above-mentioned time the matrass v/ns opened and its con-

tents filtered. The filtered liquor was then treated with solid potash, and after-

wards exposed to the temperatm-e of a water-bath till ammonia ceased to be

Whenevolved.  this was obs-'rved, the alcohol was distilled off, and nitric acid

added in excess to the residue. Finally, this was evaporated to dryness at a low

temperatm-e, and the liberated organic acid taken up by alcohol. Ey dissolving

in absolute alcohol, and crystallizing from water, the acid was obtained qiute pure.

The quantity of acid formed was not large. Dried at 100° Cent., it gave the

following numbers on analysis :

It had, tliei], the composition of succinic acid. That it wa3 the ordinary acid

--was sufficiently proved bj' the following- properties and reactions : It melted at

179° Cent., and sublimed in the form of needles on the application of a higlier
temperature. The Aapour produced, on being inhaled, instant coughing and a
painful sensation in the nostrils. The neutralized acid gave an abundant brown
precipitate on the addition of perchlorido of iron. This test was tried both before
and after the body in question had been treated with nitric acid, and with the
same result.

   The only explanation I can give of the formation of ordinary succinic acid in

this case is, that the chloride of ethyle chlore was, in presence of the cyanide of
potassium, partially converted, by the high temperatm'e to which it had been sub-
jected, into chloride of ethylene, one ecLuiyalent of hydrogen changing its place
with one equivalent of chlorine :

         CHCl,      CH,C1.

   Since the above was written I perceive that M. Wichelhaus * has formed the
isomeric acid from cyaupropiouic acid. The difference between it and the ordinary-
acid is well marked. Its melting-point is 40° lower, and it does not, when neutra-

lized, give a precipitate "«-ith perchloride of iron.

   These results correspond, to a certain extent, with the researches of M. Caventou,
who has shoviTi that ordinaiy glycol can be obtained from the bromide of ethyle

brome.

          On the Economization of Sidphurous Acid in Copper Smelting.

                               By Peter Spexce, F.C.S.

   Lord Derby (in 1861) obtained the appointment of a committee of the House of
Lords for obtaining evidence as to the noxious vapom's from chemical and other
v,-orks. That investigation, carried over many mouths, resulted in the passing of
the .\lkali Works Act, so ably and successfully carried out by Dr. Angus Suiith

as inspector.

  A large amount of evidence was elicited by the committee as to the emission of

sulphurous acid and arsenious acid from the copper smelting v.-orks of Swansea
and other parts of the Iringdom, but no legislation was adopted as to these works,
because, with the exception of the writer of this paper, all the witnesses testified
to there being no practicable means of suppressing the acknowledged nuisance
without destroj'ing the trade.

   The object of this paper is to show that the means then proposed to the Lords'
Committee by the writer for, to a large extent, suppressing this nuisance, by the
conversion of the sulphurous acid into sulphuric acid by the aid of furnaces of the

                                             On the Preservation of Stone. Bij John Spillee, F.C.S.

For several years past the author has been studying the causes of the decay of

stone, and experimenting with such chemical reagents as appeared to oiler any
promise of being usefully applied as means of prevention. jVt an early stage of

the investigation it seemed probable that the corrosive action of sulphurous and
sulphuric acids in the atmosphere, resulting from the combustion of coal fuel,
would operate, in large towns especially, in a destructive manner upon dolomite
and the numerous class of limestones commonly employed in public buildings.
This chemical action, aided by the simultaneous attack of carbonic acid and mois-
ture, and in the winter season further supplemented by the disintegrating efiects

of frost, are conceived to furnish a sufficient explanation of all the tacts observed.

Dr. Angus Smith, Mr. Spence, and others having already directed attention to the

immense scale of production of these sulphur-acids, the author proceeded to quote
statistical data showing the extent or degree of pollution of the air from this cause
in the manufacturing districts of Lancashire. Numerous samples of dolomite,

Caen, Bath, and Portland stones fresh from the quarry have been tested, but with-

out finding more than a trace of ready-formed sulphate, whereas scrapings taken

from the decayed portions of the stone of the New Palace at Westminster were

bitter to the taste, in consequence of the comparativel}- largo amount of sidphatc

of magnesia formed durhig a few years' exposure to the sulphurous gases occurriug

in a metropolitan atmosphere. Caen stone from several buildings and localities,

Portland stone, and even old faces of chalk clifi'in the neiglibourhood of Woolwich,

were in like manner found to contain appreciable quantities of the sulphate of

Alime, having rmdoubtedlj^ a similar origin.                     close examination into the circum-

stances attending the decay of stone at the Houses of Parliament invariably shows

an increased liability to corrosion under the projecting eaves and mouldings, and

at such sheltered parts of the stone surfaces as are usually covered with soot and

dust, and are in a position to retain for the longest period the moisture absorbed

during a season of rain. In many cases the disintegrated stone exhibits white

crystals of the sulphate of magnesia, which alternately dissolving and reciystal-

lizing in the pores of the stone, may be conceived to exert a disruptive action

sufficient to account for the scaling and fracture of the dolomite, which has been
so often observed. With the view of overcoming some of these difficulties, the

author submitted a plan to the lioyal Commissioners charged with inquiring into

the decay of stone at Westminster, in May 1861, which consisted in the applica-

tion to the cleaned surfaces of the stone of an aqueous solution of supei-phosphate

--of lime a salt remarkable for its action in hardening the surfaces of chalk, Caen

stone, or other calcareous building-stone to which it may be applied, either by

brushing or immersion, and which acts upon the carbonate of lime in the stone,
                               --

giving rise to the formation of Bodeker's salt (crystallized diphosphate of lime

2CaO, HO, PO3 -f- 4 Aq). This suggestion received a practical trial at the

Houses of Parliament, in a competition to which five other candidates were
admitted by the Right Hon. the First Commissioner of Her Majesty's Works in

April 1864.

   Another promising scheme for the treatment of the decayed stone, especially
applicable to dolomite, consists in the employment of baryta conjointly with the

hardening salt, so that a base may be presented which is endowed with the power

of destroying the soluble sidphate of magnesia in the pores of the stone, forming
with it the remarkably insoluble sulphate of baryta, and at the same time engaging

the magnesia in one of its most diihcultly soluble combinations. On a recent
occasion tliis process was applied to some Caen-stone facings at St. John's Church,

Woolwich, which were badly decayed. Several examples of the application of
the superphosphate to decayed Caen, stone were referred to ; and with respect to

Portland stone, the earliest experiments were said to have been made at the Army

Clothing Establishment, Woolwich, where (in 1861) some decayed window-sills
were treated with perfect success.

    In connexion with the treatment of Portland stone, some interesting results
were then described, which serve to illustrate the increased hardness and strength,
and the diminished rate and capacity of water-absorption attending the employ-

ment of the superphospliate. By treating small cubes of Portland stone with the
phosphate solution, and when dry subjecting them to gradually increasing pressure

mitil crushed between plates of lead in the American Testing ^Machine at the

Royal Gun Factor}', it was found that the breaking weight of the stone was aug-
mented by 50 per cent. The increased hardness of the stone after treatment could

be readily ascertained by scratching with a pointed instrument of copper, which
metal proved to possess a degree of hardness intermediate between the original
and treated Portland stones. The porosity of the stone, as indicated by the
amount of water absorbed, proved to be greatly diminished in tlie case of the
treated cubes. The advantage of the process is most clearly apparent in the denser
and more compact variety of Portland known as the " Whit Bed," which alone is
employed for external building purposes ; that kno-wm as the " Base Bed," is softer,
and only lit for internal decoration, and its texture is so porous that in becoming
saturated it absorbs nearly 10 per cent, of watei'. Samples of Mansfield dolomite
absorbed amounts of water varying in difterent specimens from 6 to 8 per cent.
After treatment by this process, the degree of absorption was reduced one half, aud-
the results were even more favourable in the case of Caen stone. The cost of
materials employed in the treatment of stone according to this plan is very trifling,
and bears but a small proportion to the cost of labour necessarily expended upon
the cleaning and preliminary preparation of the stone before the solution can be
applied. One gallon of solution will cover about 250 feet superficial, when two
coatings are applied upon Caen or Portland stone. Tlie superphosphate employed
must not contain any appreciable amount of sidphuric acid, and the specific gravity
of the solution, when diluted for use, should be about I'l.

    On certain Neiv Processes in Photographj. By John Spillee, F.CS.

. Under this head were described several interesting improvements in photography,
based on the chemistry of gelatine. The processes to which reference was made
were the various modifications of the Woodbury tj'pe, including the new method
of micro-photo-sculpture, the art of photolithography, as practised in the Ro3al
Arsenal at ^^'^oolwich, and some illustrations of the use of gelatine or albumen, on

a foundation of silk, satin, or cambric, the work of Mr. H. B. Pritchard, of the War

Department. The Hon. H. Fox Talbot was one of the first to describe and make
a practical use of the action of light upon a mixture of gelatine and a soluble
bichromate, and after him Col. Sir H. James, Mr. Swan, of Newcastle, and Mr.
Woodbury, of Manchester, have applied the same chemical principle in new direc-
tions. It is Imown that the chemical rays of light have the effect of rendering
insoluble gelatine to which a bichromate has been added ; and it would appear that
this oxidizing salt hardens the animal substance by forming with it a combination
--46 REPORT 1867.

of clnoiuic oxido. In proof of tliis view, it may be stated that Mr. Swan has hitely

devised a mode of working, in which a minute quantity of chrome alum or sulphate
of chromium is used instead of the red chromate, and it is foimd that, when dried,

this mixture is not again atfected by water. The carbon prints of Mr. Swan, which

were exhibited last year at Nottingham, are illustrations of the use of a eliromate

in conjunction v,'ith gelatine and pigments. Mr. Woodbuiy's process is also based

on the insolubility of the chromo-gelatiue after exposm'e to light, and upon the

subsequent action of water upon a sensitive film, which has been in different degrees

influenced by insolation imder an ordinary photographic negative. The depths of
mtint in the original are represented by variations
                                                     the thickness of the film of

gelatine left unacted upon by water, and this dried may then be used as a matrix

to produce a corresponding series of depressions upon a surface of lead or type-

metal by the aid of a powerful hydraidic press. The blocks so produced serve for
printing" off a great number of proofs when they are liberally '-inked" with warm

gelatine, highly charged with Frankfort black or other suitable pigment, and pressed

down upon"^a smooth sheet of paper until the excess of ink is forced out on all four

sides of the block and so removed from the space constituting the area of the pic-

ture, which, when set, is, lastly, protected with a varuisli of collodion.

Mr. Woodbury has latelv perfected a modification of his process, which is ap-

plicable to the representation in high relief of microscopic objects. The method

consists in spreading a warm solution of gelatine, containing a little sugar and

bichromate of potash, over a glass plate previously coated with collodion. The

film sets on cooling, and is then placed in contact with an ordinary photographic

negative of the microscopic objects to be delineated, exposed to light, submitted as

before to the action of water, and the soluble portions washed away. "When the

surface moisture has evaporated, a mixture of plaster of Paris, containing a small

proportion of alum, is poiu-ed over the relief to the thickness of half an inch, and

left to set. When diy it will be found, owing to the alum in the plaster harden-

ing the surface of the gelatine directly on coming in contact there-w-ith, to leave the

gelatine easilv, vrithout any fear of adhesion. To give a finished appearance to

the resulting casts, this iutoglio, when dry, may be placed in a lathe, and a suit-

able border turned on it, which will bo 'represented in the residting proofs by a

raised border, similar to what is seen on medallions or plaster casts. The name of

the object may also be neatly engi-aved on the intaglio, to appear in raised cha-

racters on the reliefs. This intaglio should then be well waxed to fill up the pores,

and is ready for taking any number of impressions in plaster ; or a better plan is to

take one in plaster, and having smoothed away any defects, to moidd a reverse in

sulphur, which will give a gTcater number of fine impressions. The progi'ess made

during the year in perfecting the details of photolithogTaphy have led to the

practi'cal use" of this art as a means of procuring on a reduced scale printed repro-

ductions of the large series of lithographs issued for the use of the British army by

the Royal Carriage Department. The steps followed in conducting this process

were briefly described, and a variety of illustrations produced at a veiy low co.st

were exhilnted. The issue of these' photolithogi-aphs by the War Department has-

already attained to many thousands.

On the Electrical Besisfances of the Fixed and Volatile Oils*,

                   By T. T. P. Beuce Waeeen.

   The -want of an aclmowledged and reliable means of recog-nizina: the purity or

condition of sranples of oils has long been felt by pharmaceutists. No tests, or
system of tests at present used, are free from objection. An inspection of the optical

characters of the oils, -whether fixed or volatile, will be sufficient to confirm the

truth of this observation.

The polariscope has at best a very lunited scope of application, whilst the deter-

mination of the refractive or dispersive qualities requires such precise adjustments

that the suitability either of the one or the other for the pm-poses of a technical

test maj' be fairly questioned. The refractive power of the oils, both fixed and

volatile, has so small a variation, that the difierence produced on the refractive

power of cany oil by the addition of a small quantity of another, would be barely

perceptible. The objection ag-aiust the measm'ement of the dispersive action as a

means of expressing- the value of an oil is, that the determination of the difterences

of indices of refraction for the extreme rays is at once tedious and unreliable the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

scale of dispersions offers, however, a much wider range of difterences.

It is probable that the compai'ison of two samples of oil by the irrationalities of

their dispersion is worthy of some attention. The author is not aware of its being

applied as a test ; but the samples could stand side by side with respect to the

illuminating source, and their spectra projected side by side could be easily observed

and compared.

Although bromine and iodine exert on some of the essential oils chemically

characteristic effects, it does not appear certain to what extent the action may be

modified by the addition of small quantities of other oils ; consequently the che-

mical phenomena, as well as a knowledge of their specific gi-avities and boiling-

points, cannot be considered as ofl'ering any assistance to the detection of accidental

or intentional impurities when existing in small quantities.

The process which the author submitted is one which has given great satis-

faction in all the experiments which he has made, and was suggested b}' a discoveiy

due to M. Rousseau, quoted by l)e la Rive, " that olive-oil, when mixed with y5o
part its volmne of oil of poppies, increased the number of vibrations of a magnetic

needle in a given time, when the same was included or made to form part of a

voltaic circuit." This isolated fact would be of service for the determination of

the purity of olive-oil, if oil of poppies were the only soiDhisticatiaig ingredient,

The.aclulterants of the volatile oils are principally turpentine and alcohol f.
Compared with any of the essential oils, turpentine has an immense resistance,

whilst that of alcohol is enormously lower than any of them, except perhaps that

of oil of bitter almonds, whicli is so low that he did not measure it.
   The importance of this general fact is at once apparent, since the addition either

of alcohol or turpentine in the smallest quantity is readily detected                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       and the quan-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

tity denoted by the vaiiation in the defiection, either when compared with a standard

of Irno-mi purit}', or by the resistances themselves.

The oils of lemon and bcrgamot, when mixed with a small proportion of tur-

pentine, do not, however, show such marked differences as the generality of the

essential oils.

The addition of turpentine to oil of lavender is more strongly marked by this test

than in any other case.

The effects produced by mixing different specimens of the same oil together are

also perceptible ; thus tlie German oils of peppermint, or foreign samples of lavender-

 oil, produce modifications in the electrolysis.

    The bleached oils have even a lower conducting power than the unbleached oils ;
and in this respect olive-oil possesses a greater difference than almond-oil. It is

not easy to explain this.

  A singular difiereuce exists between the Italian and the East Indian castor-oils.

Tliis difference will enable one to detect a very small percentage of the one added

to the other.
    Cotton-seed-oil and oil of poppy, as well as turpentine, are so rapidly altered in

their conducting power by electrolysis, that there is not the slightest difficulty in

recognizing them in samples of oil.
   Olive-oil, when free from cotton-seed-oil or oil of poppj^, has its resistance in-

creased by electrification ; but if the smallest quantity of either of them exist in a
sample of olive-oil, it produces a contrary effect by a prolonged contact with the

battery.

    These results of electrolysis are alone important in determining the condition of

a sample of olive-oil.

On a New Ilamifactiirhig Process for the Perpetual Regeneration of the Oxide
  of Manganese used in the Manufacture of Chlorine. By AValter Weldon.

   Every process, previous to that to be described in the present paper, by which
it has been attempted to regenerate oxide of manganese from the residues of
the manufactm-e of chlorine, has Ijeen performed in the dry way, and has thus

--required considerable time, and has involved not only at least one more or less
--troublesome and costly furnace operation, but also several removals of the mate-

rial from vessel to vessel and from place to place, every such removal of course
entailing more or less loss of material. The process, however, wliich is about

to be described is performed in the wet way, and may be completed, even when

operating on the largest scale, within as little as one hour. Moreover, all the
operations of the process are performed in the same vessel as that in which the
oxide produced by it is afterwards employed to react with hydrochloric acid, and
from this vessel or still the manganese is never removed, so that it is entirely
free from risk of loss by removal ; and as it is not subject to any other cause of loss,

a charge of manganese, once put into a still, when treated by this process, not only

never needs to be replaced, but never needs even to be added to, while it will libe-
rate an equivalent of chlorine every few hours for literally any length of time. The
starting-point of any process for the regeneration of the oxide of manganese em-
ployed in the manufacture of chlorine, must of course be that residue which is

known as " still-liquor " being that which remains in the stills when oxide of man-

ganese and hydrocliloric acid have been digested together until all the chlorine
which the oxide is capable of liberating from the acid has been liberated and given

Whenoff. working with a native oxide of manganese, the still-liquor contains, in

addition to a quantity of protochloride of manganese equivalent to the quantity of
oxide of manganese which has been dissolved, a considerable quantity of free acid,
and more or less chlorides of iron and other bases, due to the native oxide of man-
ganese being always more or less associated with other oxides. Wlien working,
however, with the artificial oxide of manganese produced as is about to be described,
the still-liquor contains scarcely anything whatever but protochloride of manga-

nese ; and the new process consists simply in first adding an equivalent of lime to

this liquor, without removing the liquor from the still, and then blowing atmo-
spheric air through the resulting mixture of protoxide of manganese and solution
of chloride of calcium. The white protoxide is thereby rapidly converted into a

A'ery dark-coloured higher oxide ; and when this product has been allowed to sub-
side from the solutionof the chloride of calcium in which it was formed, and the
greater part of that solution has then been drawn off from it, it is ready to be treated
with hydrochloric acid, from which it then liberates chlorine, with reproduction of
exactl_v as much protochloride of manganese as was commenced with. From this

point the very simple series of operations described is repeated just as before, and
so on, over and over again, for any required number of times. The manganese is

recurring changes of state of combination, by wbich it passes, iirst from the state of
protocliloride to that of protoxide, next from the state of protoxide to that of a

       Address by the President, Auchibald Geikie, F.R.S., F.G.S.

Among the Lower Silurian, the oldest recognizable volcanic rocks in this country,

two principal epochs of eruption have been detected by Professor llarasay and his

colleagues of the Geological Survey. One of these occurred during the deposition

of the Llandeilo rocks, and is indicated by the igneous rocks of Aran Mowddwy,

Cader Idris, Arenig, and Moelwyn ; the other is marked by those of tlie Snowdon

district, which lie among the Bala beds. These volcanic roclfs consist partly of

massive sheets of felstone, varving in texture and colour, and partly of thick accu-

mulations of tuff or ash. The former are true lava-flows, the latter point to fre-

quent showers of volcanic dust, and to the settling of such dust and stones on the

sea-bottom, where they mingled with the ordinary sediment, and with sliells, corals

and other organisms. Some of these ashy deposits attain a great thickness. Thus,

at Cader Idris, they are abou.t 2500 feet tliick, the accumulated result of many

eruptions. Northwards this mass thins entirely away, and the ordinary sedimentary

strata take its place. Equally local are the massi-\-e beds of felstone which repre-

sent the submarine lava-flows of the time. Sometimes they still preserve the

--slaggy vesicular character which marked their surface when the meltiKl rock was

in a state of motion along the sea-bottom an evidence of the existence and posi-

tion of true submarine volcanoes during the Lower Silurian period in Wales. In

the lake district, similar proofs of volcanic action have been found among the lower

Silurian rocks of that region. In Scotland, no ^-ery distinct traces of volcanic acti-

^dty have yet been detected among rocks of the lower Silurian age. In the Lower

Silurian rocks of the south-west of Ireland, beds of ash and felstone are interstra-

tified, resembling in general character and mode of occurrence those of Wales. In

Wales, volcanic action does not appear to have outlasted tlie Lower Silurian period

but in Ireland, among the headlands of Kerry, massive sheets of ash are intercalated

in grits and slates, which, from their fossils, have been assigned to the age of the

Wenlock series.

The Old Red Sandstone of the southern half of Scotland abounds in igneous

rocks, from the base of the series to the top. In its lower band lie the chains of

the Sidlaw and Ochil Hills, and many detached masses scattered over the lowlands

along the southern flank of the Grampians. These are composed of different fel-

stones and porphyrites, with interbedded sheets of tutt" trappean conglomerate, and

sandstone, stretching in the Ochil and Sidlaw range for sixty or seventy miles, and

risino- here and there to heights of 2000 feet above the level of the sea. This

group of hills contains some of the thickest masses of trappean rock in the country.

In what seems to be a middle portion of the formation conies the group of the

Pentland Hills, consisting of long massive beds of trap, like the difterent varieties

in the Ochils, with intercalations of tutf, conglomerate, and sandstone, the wlicje

reaching a thickness of fully 5000 feet. In Ireland also the Old Tied Sandstone

furnishes evidence of active volcanic vents. Nor are traces of volcanic activity

wanting in England dm-ing the same great geological period. In Cornwall and

South Devon frequent proofs have been recognized of contemporaneous igneous

action among the limestones and .slates of the Middle Devonian series, and thence

throuoli the Upper Devonian into the lower part of the Carboniferous group. These

consist in frequent bands of trappean ash, and of crystalline amygdaloidal and

vesicular green.stoue or other trap. The ash passes by insensible degrees into the

ordinary sedimentary strata of the series, sometimes containing fossils, and in certain

places so interlaced with bands of limestone as to have been quarried for lime.

The base of the Carboniferous series in CornNvall and South Devon is marked by

the occurrence of ash and crystalUne amygdaloidal greenstone similar to the ig-neoiis

masses in the neighbouring Devonian rocks. In the centre of England the -well-

known toad-stones of Derbyshire indicate intermittent volcanic activity during the

formation of the carboniferous limestone. They consist of three principal beds of

trap, averaging each about 60 or 70 feet in thickness, preserving their course for

many miles between the strata of limestone, probably, as pointed out by Mr. Jukes,

the result not merely of one eruption, but rather of different flows from distinct

vents, and uniting into one sheet along a common floor. Passing into Scotland, we

find the carboniferous formation of the broad midland valley full of the most stri-

king evidences of volcanic activity. In the west, gi-eat sheets of different porphy-

rites, with interbedded tuffs, sandstones and conglomerates, lie in the lower part

of the formation, and rising in broad masses bed above bed, form that conspicuous

chain of terraced heights which stretches from near Stirling through the range of

the Campsie, Kilpatrick, and Eenfi-ewshire hills, to the banks of the Irvine in

Ayi-shire, and thence westward by the Cumbrae Islands and Bute, to the south of

Ai'ran. In the eastern districts, instead of such -widespread sheets of volcanic rock,

the Carboniferous series includes hundreds of minor patches of tuff', dolerite, basalt,

and porphjTite. The area of the Lothians and Fife seems to have been dotted over

with innmnerable little volcanic vents, breaking out and then disappearing one

after another during the lapse of the Carboniferous period up to at least the close

of the carboniferous limestone. The very limited area occupied by the erupted

Amaterial is often remarkable.  mass of ash 100 feet thick or more may be found

intercalated between certain strata, yet at a distance of a mile or two the same

strata may show no trace of any volcanic material. Nowhere is this feature more

wonderfullj' exhibited than in the coal-field of Dalrj' in the northern part of Ayr-

shire. The black-band ironstone of that district appears to have been deposited in

hollows between mounds and cones of volcanic tuft', sometimes 600 feet high, round

and over which the later members of the Lower Carboniferous formation were de-

posited. Hence the shafts of the pits are sometimes sunk forlOO fathoms through

the tuff; and at that depth nrines are driven horizontally through the volcanic rocks

to reach the ironstone beyond. The great carboniferous limestone series of Ireland

contains evidence that here and there, at various intervals during its formation,

minor volcanic vents were active on dift'erent parts of the sea-bottom.

   Among the Permian sandstones of the south-west of Scotland there occur some

interesting proofs of contemporaneous volcanic action. In Nithsdale, and still more

conspicuously in the centre of the Ayrshire coal-field, these sandstones contain

towards their base a thick group of dark reddish-brown amygdaloidal porphyrites

and tuft's. Connected -with these rocks are numerous bosses of a coarse volcanic

agglomerate, which descend vertically through the coal-measures, altering the coal.

They are the "necks" or orifices from which was ejected the volcanic material
which now forms a conspicuous range of rising grounds overlying the heart of the

coal-basin of Ayrshire.

  The New Red Sandstone series of Devonshire, in the neighbourhood of Exeter,

furnishes clear proofs of volcanic activity. Sheets of a dark reddish-brown fel-

spathic rock, sometimes compact or porphyritic, but usually of scoriaceous character,

are intercalated among the lower parts of the Red Sandstone series of that neigh-
bourhood. Sir Henry De la Beche, who described these igneous roclis many years

ago, noticed that the more compact portions, instead of extending horizontallj' as
beds among the sedimentary strata, descend vertically through them, as if these

detached parts marked the site of some of the orifices whence the melted lava was

rupted.

   The series of successive volcanic phenomena, which may thus be traced through

the palaeozoic rocks of the British Islands up to the New Red Sandstone, is now
abruptly brolten. I am not aware of any satisfactory proofs of contemporaneous

volcanic rocks among the secondary rocks of Britain, save in the Red Sandstone of

Devonshire just referred to. FolloM-ing a suggestion of Prof. Edward Forbes, I

fonnerly regarded the great ti-appean masses of Skye and the other western island.?
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  51

as probably of Oolitic age. But more recent investigations in Antrim, Mull, and

Eigg, have convinced me that in these districts, and probably also in Skye, the

great basaltic plateaux which form so conspicuous a feature in the scenery of om*

north-western sea-board, date from tertiary times. From Antrim northwards

through the inner Hebrides and the Faroe Islands to Iceland there is a broken
chain of volcanic masses, part, and not improbably the whole, of which are of
Miocene age. In Ireland sheets of dolerite and basalt, in all 500 or 600 feet
thick and some 1200 square miles in extent, repose directly upon an eroded sur-
face of chalk. In Mull, similar plateaux, overlaid with masses of porphyrite and
trach}i;e-]ike rocks, attain a united thickness of more than 3000 feet, yet at their
base they contain recognizable plants of Miocene species. This vast depth of old

--lavas and tufls points to a lengthened continuance of volcanic activity along the

north-western margin of our coimtry an activity, however, marked by prolonged
periods of repose, as the Scuir of Eigg and the coal and shales of Mull sufficiently
prove. These masses, vast thougli they be, are by no means the only, if they are
indeed the chief, relics of Tertiary volcanic action in Britain. If, starting from the

basaltic plateaux of the north of Ireland or of the inner Hebrides, we advance to-
wards the south-east, we soon observe that an endless number of trap-dykes,

striking from these plateaux, extends in a south-easterly direction athwart our
island. The south-western half of Scotland and the northern parts of England are,
so to speak, ribbed across with thousands of dykes. These are most numerous
near the main mass of igneous rock, whence they become fewer as they recede
towards the North Sea. Usually a dyke cannot be traced far. In Berwickshire

and the Lothians, these E. and W. or N.W. and S.E. dykes, often less than half a

mile long, are well shown ; in AjTshire they become still more numerous, tra-
versing the coal-field and altering the coal-seams ; in An-an .and Cantyre their
number still increases, until, after a wonderfid profusion of them in Islay and Jura,
they reach the great volcanic chain of the inner Hebrides. From their manifest
intimate connexion with tliat chain, from the fact that they cut through all the
formations they encomiter up to and including the chalk, and that they cross faults
of every size that maj' lie in their way, I regard these dykes as of tertiary age. If
this inference is sustained, as I have little doubt it wiU be, by a more detailed
investigation of the north-western districts, it presents us with striking evidence

of the powerfid activity and wide range of the volcanic forces in our country
dming the Miocene period. With these dykes, and the Tertiary igneous masses
from which they proceed, the record of volcanic action in Britain appears to

close.

   Let nie now allude to one or two portions of this broad subject which seem to
me worthy of special notice. One of the first features to arrest attention is the

singular persistence of volcanic phenomena in a limited area. Take, as an illustra-
tion, the neighbourhood of Edinburgh within a radius of ten miles from the town.
First and oldest comes the long range of the Pentland and Braid hills, consisting
of a mass of bedded igaieous rocks in a middle series of the Old Bed Sandstone.
These old lavas reach a thiclmess of 4000 or oOOO feet. Next in chronological
order are the Calton Hill and lower portion of Arthur's Seat, which mark the con-
tinuance of volcanic action into the Lower Carboniferous period. The carboniferous

rocks for miles around these hills are full of the traces of contemporaneous volca-
noes, sometimes in the form of sheets of tuff marking the occmTcnce of little
detached tufi-cones, sometimes in wider areas of tuff, basalt, and dolerite, where a

group of minor volcanic vents threw out showers of ash and streams of lava. To
the east rise the isolated Garlton Hills, which date from before the carboniferous
limestone ; westwards, scores of little basaltic crags and rounded tuff-hills mark
out the lower carboniferous volcanoes of Linlithgowshire. To the north, the end-
less crags, hills and hiUocks of the Fife coast contain the record of many eruptions
from the middle of the calciferous sandstones high up into the carboniferous lime-
stone gTOup. Even the coal-measures of that county are pierced with intrusive
bosses of trappean agglomerate, which indicate the position of volcanic vents, pos-
sibly of Permian age. The same or a more recent date must be assigned to the
later unconformable agglomerate and basalt of Arthin-'s Seat. Nor is this the
whole. Latest of all come innumerable trap-dykes, running with a prevalent east

                                                                                                       4*

and west trend, and cutting througli all the other roclcs. Hero, then, in this little

tract, about the size of a small English county, there are the chronicles of a long

series of volcanic eruptions, bepinning in the" middle of the Old Red Sandstone,
and coming down to a time relatively so near oiu- own as that of the Miocene

rocks. Nor is this by any means an exceptional district. Illustrations of a similar
persistence of volcanic action may be gathered in many other tracts of equally

limited extent.

Another fact which a general survey of the character of our volcanic rocks

soon brings before us, is that, as a whole, those of earlier date diifer distinctively

in composition from those of more recent origin. From the first traces of volcanic
activity in this countrv up to about the close of the Old Red Sandstone or begin-

ning of the Carboniferous series, the interbedded (i. e. contemporaneous) igneous

rocks consist for the most part of highly felspathic masses, to which the names

of clinkstone, clavstone, compact felspar, porphyry, hornstone, felstone, &c. have

been given. On "tlie other liand, from the upper part of the Old Red Sandstone,

or the lower members of the Carboniferous series, up to the end of the long

history, the erupted masses are chiefly augitic, as basalts aud dolerit(!s (or gi-een-

stones, as the latter ha-^e been usually termed in Scotland). Were these rocks

subjected to further aud more detailed chemical examination, additional know-

ledge might possibly be acquired respecting the history of thechanges which have

taken place witliin "the crust of the earth." As geologists, it is important to note

that, though two classes of volcanic rocks can thus be determined by analysis of

their composition, no broad essential distinctions appear to be traceable iu their

mode of occurrence. Certain minor differences are, indeed, readily observable,

such as the greater thickness of the beds among the older rocks, and the more

frequent occurrence of columnar structure among the newer. Perliaps these and

other distinctions may eventually give us a general type for each class. Never-

theless, in its broader" features there would seem to have been a striking -unifor-

mity iu volcanic action from the earliest times down to our owu day.

This leads me to remark that a study of the igneous rocks of Britain furnishes

no proofs that volcanic action lias been slowly diminishing in intensity during past

geological time. The amount of volcanic material preserved in our Old Red Sand-

stone group probably exceeds that of our Silurian system, even after all due allow-

ance for the greater denudation of the older .series. The number of distinct

volcanic centres traceable among the Carboniferous rocks in like manner surpasses

that of the earlier formations. I3ut by much the most extensive mass of volcanic

--material in these islands belongs to the latest epoch of eruption that of the

Miocene period. In one mountain alone, Ben More, in Mull, these youngest lavas

rise  over each  other, tier above  tier, to a height of more than -3000 feet                                                                                                                                                                               yet their
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

base is concealed under the sea, and their top has been removed by denudation.

We have here, therefore, no proof of a slow diminution of volcanic activity. The

period separating the Miocene basalts from the New Red Sandstone trap-rocks,

which seem to come next to them iu point of recentness, was immensely vaster

than that which has elapsed between the Miocene basalts aud the present time.

There is thus no improbability in the eventual outbreak once more of the subter-

ranean forces. Nay, further, were a renewed series of volcanic eruptions to take

place now, they might iu the far distant future be thrown together with those of

Miocene date, as proofs of one long period of interrupted volcanic activity, just as

we now group the igneous rocks of the Lower Silurian, or of any other geological

formation : so near to us, in a geological sense, are those latest and grandest of our

volcanic phenomena.

  Among the different forms assumed by our igneous rocks, one of the most in-

teresting, and, at the same time, most full of difficulty, is that of the trap-dykes.

To my own mind tliere are few parts of the geology of the couutiy so hard to

imderstand as the extravasation of the thousands of dykes by which the north-

western portion of this island is so completely traversed. For the reasons already
assigned, I would refer the leading system of these dykes to the same geological

age as the Tertiary volcanic rocks of the north-west. Yet we find them rising to

the surface, aud extending for leagues, to a distance of fully 200 miles from the

nearest point of the basaltic plateaux. Did they reach the surfixce originally ? If
TKANSACTIONS OF TIIK SECTIONS.                                            53

SO, were they connected with outflows of dolerite, now wholly removed hy denu-
dation ? I confess that this supposition has often presented ilself to me as camdng
with it much proba1:)ility. It seems to me unlikely that so many thousands of

dykes should have risen so high as the present surface, retaining- there (as shown
by deep mines) much the same proportions as they show many fathoms down,

and yet that none of them should have reached the surface which existed at the
time of eruption. I regard it as much more probable that some of them, at least,

rose to daylight, and flowed out as coidees, even over parts of the south of Scot-

land and north of England, where all trace of such siu'face-masses has long been

removed. Some of the siuface-masses of dolerite in these districts may indeed be

of Tertiary age yet the proofs which the great Miocene basaltic plateaux present
                                                                        ;

of enoimous denudation are so striliing as to make the total disappearance of even

wide and deep lava-cuiTents quite conceivable. But a much more serious difficulty

remains. These dykes, as a ride, do not come up along lines of fault, j-et they

preserve wonderfully straight courses, even across fractured and irregular strata.

Each dyke retains, as a rule, a tolerably uniform breadth, and its sides are sharply

defined, as if a clean, sti'aight fissure had been widened .and filled up with solid

rock. In the coal-mines of Ayrshire, for instance, the miners have driven through

the dyke and found the coal, altered indeed, but at the same level, at the other

side. More than this, the dj'kes are found cutting across large faidts v^dthout any

deflection or alteration. In short, no kind of geological structure, no change in

the nature of the rocks traversed, seems to make any difference in the dykes.

These run on in their straight and approximately parallel courses over hill and

valley for miles. The larger faults of this country tend to take a north-easterly

trend, and correspond in a general way with the strike of the formations. At right

angles, or more or less obliquely to these, are numerous fiudts of lesser magnitude,

which follow roughly the dip of the rocks. But though these dillerent systems of
fissures already existed, and, as we might suppose, would have served as natural

pathway's for the escape of the subterranean melted rock towards the surface, the

latter rose through a new series of fractures, often running side by side with those

of older date. How were these new fractm-es produced? and how is it that they

shoidd run through all formations, up to and including the older parts of the

Miocene basalts, not as faidts, v\"ith a throw on one side, but as clean, straight

fissiu'es, with the strata at the same level on each side ? I do not pretend to

answer these questions. Let me only remark that, had the trap-rock been itself

the disrupting agent, it would have risen through the older fractures which already

existed as the planes of least resistance. The new fissures must be assigned to

some far more general force, of the action of which the trap itself furnishes per-

haps additional evidence.

Another featiu-e of oiu- igneous rocks deserving more special consideration is the

Aoccurrence among them of true vents, or the sites of volcanic orifices.  very

considerable number of these vents is filled up with a coarse agglomerate, consist-

ing of fragments of different trap-rocks, with pieces of the surrounding sedimentary

strata. Such vents are sometimes not larger than a diniug-table. In many cases,
where the material filling them is fine in texture, it is well stratified ; but its beds
are on end, or thrown into diff'erent inclined positions. The strata around them
are much indurated, and frequently, perhaps usually, are bent sharply down roiuid

the margin of the vent, as if the ash or agglomerate, from contraction or otherwise,

had sunk and pulled the adhering strata down with it. Instructive sections of

these rocks abound along the coast line of Fife and East Lothian, and they occur

likewise in Ayrshire. One other part of the subject may be alluded to as deserving

of inquiry. There seem to be indications that local but well-marked metamor-

phism and the extravasation of syeuitic and granitic rocks have taken place in

connexion with some of our most recent volcanic phenomena. In Skye, Mull, and

Arran the association of such crystalline rocks with sheets or dykes of dolerite and

basalt shoidd be worked out carefull}\ The volcanic rocks of Britain are now

brought under the notice of the Section with the view of indicating a field of

research where much remains to be discovered, and [where the labourers are but

few. As a result of the neglect into which it has fallen, the nomenclature of this

portion of British geology has been virtually at a stand for about half a century.

While so much has beeu done in this respect by chemists and geologists abroad,
we are but little further forward than when the great outlines of the subject were
sketched long ago by the eaiiy leaders in the science. The same vague names, the

same confused and defective arrangement, the same absence of careful chemical
and miueraiogical analysis, so excusable in the infaucj' of the science, still disfigure
cm- geological writings and even the best of our geological collections. Field-
geologists must be content to bear their share of tlie blame yet it is not from

their hands that the needed reform is mainly to be looked for. They can do but
little till chemistry comes to their aid with information regarding the composition
of the rocks which they investigate, and the extent to which the nomenclature
adopted in other countries can be applied in their own. Siu'ely the time must
come ere long when it -wdll be deemed a task worthy of years of long and patient
research to work out the natm'e and history of the volcanic rocks of this country.
Such a task will not be the work of a single observer. It will require the labour
of the geologist, skilled to glean the data that can only be gathered in the field,
and of the chemist who, aided and guided by these observations, shall seek to
determine the composition of the diflerent igneous rocks, and the relation which,
in this respect, they bear to the rocks of other regions, and to tlie products of
modern volcanoes. But whether distant or near, the day will doubtless arrive
when we shall be able to connect into one story, as far at least as our fragmentary
records j[will permit, the narrative of the varied volcanic eruptions which from
early geological times have taken place in the British Islands, and to link that
chronicle with the long history of volcanic action over the globe.

of a road recently made between He Eousse and S. Florent, on the north-western
side of the island. The section presented unniistakeable and numerous alterna-
tions of compact, well-crystallized, whitish-grey granite, with argillaceous rock,
schists, grits, and rotten granite. The dip of the various beds varies from 30° to
10°, diminishing towards the north ; the thickness of tlic beds is often several yards,
but not very great. There is much granite near, towards the interior of the coim-
try, and stratified rocks near the coast. The general inference of the author fi'om

           On the Lagoons of Corsica. By D. T. Ansied, M.A., F.R.S.

   The eastern coast of Corsica, though now the most malarious district in the
Mediterranean, was inhabited and healtliy 2000 years ago ; and there is good his-

torical e'vidence that it continued healthy till the end of the fifteenth century.

Remains of two cities are still to be traced on these plains, which are now abso-
lutely deserted. Each town was situated at the southern extremity of a large
existing lagoon, near a principal river, provided in each case with a delta. Beyond

each river, to the north, are numerous small torrents, originally entering the sea,

but now feeding the lagoons, which have been formed by the sands of the delta

drifted northwards from one river delta to the next beyond, owing to the prevalent
winds. The drainage of the torrents is received into and supplies the lagoons.
During summer there is no water brought down, and a sand-bar has accumulated
until it has become a bank. In winter, the waters brought down are driven
towards the northern and open end to escape, but they leave behind a large quan-
tity of organic matter which during the subsequent heats of summer rots, and
becomes converted into miasma. So long as the communication was open from
the torrents to the sea the coast was healthy, but so soon as the lagoon was
formed the malaria set in.

   The largest of the lagoons is that of Biguglia, extending from the delta of the
Golo nearly eight miles towards the north. Its greatest width is 3000 yards,
diminishing first to 2000 for a long distance, and then to 1000. About a mile

from the nortliem extremity it becomes a mere passage for the surplus watei",
about eighty yards wide, terminating in a narrow opening to the sea, liable to be
choked up. It is separated from the sea by a sand-bank, at fii'st 900 yai-ds -v^ide,
diminishing to 300 yards. This is generally high enough to keep out the highest
storm-waters ; but there are remains of two old cuts thi'ough which the sea enters
occasionally. The area of the lagoon is 4800 acres ; the depth averages live or six
feet below the mean level of the Mediterranean. Besides a large number of winter
torrents, there is one river emptying into the lagoon. The area supplying the tor-
rents is about 20,000 acres, and "that feeding the river and torrents to the north of
it, about 25,000 acres. The mean annual rainfall of the district is estimated
(from three years' observations) at twenty-four inches, of which ten inches fall in
October and 'November, which is the rainy season.

   The history of the formation of the lagoon is very clear. About 2000 years ago
the bank of sand now nearly closing it did not exist. The bank must have com-
menced and increased gradually till about 300 years ago, when it was completed.
The gi-adual depopidation continued for about two centuries. The bank is about
seven miles long, a quarter of a mile wide, and fifteen feet high above the shallow

sea-bottom outside.

   There is proof of the recent closing up of the lagoon in old walls and fragments
of buildings near the northern end. There is no doubt of the comparatively
modern elevation of all Corsica, but this will not account for the lagoons. These
are due to the drifting of the sands, as explained ; and as the mihealthiness of the
island (which is extreme) is due to the lagoons, it would be diminished if they
were greatly reduced. The author believes that by separating the drainage areas
of the lake into two parts, and removing, by pmuping, the whole southern part,
which is perfectly practicable, at least 4000 acres of rich land would be recovered,
and the rest of the land rendered cultivable. The operation could be adopted
with great facility and at small expense, and could not fail to exercise an impor-

tant iuilueuce on the material prosperity of Corsica.

Oil the Granites and other Roclcs of Ben More, from a Letter addressed to Pro-
    fessor Phillips. Bi/ His Geace the Duke of Aegyll, LL.D., F.B.S.

   When I was in the island of Mull the other day, I observed a fact wliich may

perhaps be of some interest, which is, that Ben Craig, one of the lower shoulders of

Ben More, exhibits very clearly the passage of a rock which looks like pure trap

into reo-ular gi-anite. At the base of the shoulder moimtain, which may be about
2000 feet high, it is a mass of a fine-grained compact granite. At the top it is a

mass of stuft" which weathers white, and has a fracture like some kinds of trap. At

an intermediate elevation the trap-like stuff contains many crystals of felspar very
Adistinctly separated.
                        little lower down these crystals become more frequent, and

a  granitiform  rock  appears                                       and very little  lower the  regular  granite suhtervenes.
                                                                 ;

I could detect no separation. The top of the mountain is very white, the rock

very shattered, some of it very light, with one or two dykes passing through this

trap-like mass. The dykes are of a closer texture, v.'ith white crystals, wholly

unlike the surroimding mass. I must add that, though this stuff breaks like a

kind of trap, it is wholly unlike trap in other respects. It is perfectly amorphous,

both in structure and iu'the mode in v>rhich it occurs. It is not laid in sheets and

terraces like the traps of the same island elsewhere. In short it is not trap at aU,

but the matter out of which granite seems to have been made by pressure, and

--crystallization under pressm-e.

                                   Report on recent Eicploratlons in the Crihraltar Ctwes.

                                   By Capt. Feed. Beome.

   The explorations recorded in tliis commuuication were conducted principally in
" Martin's " and St. Michael's Caverns.

   Martin's Cave opens on the eastern face of the rock, below O'Hara's Tower. It is

an ancient sea-cave, though now upwards of 700 feet above the level of the Medi-

terranean. The excavations in this cavern were commenced on the 23rd of June,

and continued till the 22nd of July. There were no traces whatever of any previous

attempts at exploration. The first operation was to excavate the dark earth all
along, close to the south side, which is from six to three feet in depth. At this

depth the diggers came upon a stalagmite floor of varying thickness. Here, after

a few hours' work, were found deposited two portions of a lower jaw, supposed to

be human ; about two bushels of bones of ox, goat, sheep, rabbit, &c. ; several
bones of birds and fish : two bushels of broken potteiy of the rudest or unmarked

kind, 57 pieces ornamented; 61 handles and pots; 6 stone axes and 70 flint

knives                             1 excellent flint core ;  20 lbs. of flint chips ;  12 pieces of worked bone ;                                         a
                                ;

portion of an annlet and anklet ; 10 lbs of sea shells, and a few land shells,

together with three rounded pebbles. On the north side the same class of objects

were met with, and in a small chamber on this side, under five or six feet of earth.

Captain Erome's son came upon a small chamber containing two ancient swords,

one partly imbedded in             stalagmite, and           both  nmch injured                                                                 and on a  subsequent
                                                                                                                                             ;

occasion, a small enamelled copper plate was found, which appears to have had a

design upon it of a bird with its bill open, in the coils of a serpent. The colours

are bright, and the object is beautifully made. These interesting relics have been

referred by Mr. Franks to the eleventh or twelfth centuries. Excavations were

then made in a cavern, situated on the same face of the rock, but a little to tlie
south, and at a higher level than " Martin's " Cave, and named by Captain Brome

the " Fig-Tree Ca-\-e," in wliich similar rude works of art, consisting of fragments

of pottery, flint and stone implements, &c. were found.

Captain Erome's greatest interest, liowever, was centi'ed in "St. MichneTs

Cave," in ^^hich, day after day, numerous human remains were found, some im-

bedded in the stalagmite, others loose, associated with stone axes, flint chips, and

flint knives of the smallest size hitherto met with in the Gibraltar ca'Nerns.

On the north side of the upper chamber in St. Michael's Cavern, on breaking up

a thick stalagmite floor, a small aperture was discovered. 'SMien this had been

enlarged sufficiently to admit of Captain Brome's entrance, he found a series of

passages and ca^erns, the extreme travelling distance of which fi'om the entrance

was exactly 200 feet. There were no means of access to it, excepting by the

apertm'e by which Captain Brome entered. The walls were snow-white, and the

pillars and stalactites of the most variable and fantastic forms. Some of the latter,

with the thickness only of a goose quill, were five feet long ! The bearings of the
cavern generally run N.^^^ At the south end of this cavern a perpendicular fissui-e

was discovered, through which came a strong wind. The fissure was about nine

inches wide, but one of the men (military prisoners) employed was found small
enough to creep through it. He returned with a wonderful story of what he had
seen. On the next day, accordingly. Captain Brome sent in one of his own sons,
about twelve years old, who entirely corroborated the statements pre'\"iously given,

viz. that there were three caves, the first very small, and about twelve feet from

the narrow entrance. At some distance further there was another, abotit twenty

feet square, and still further, a cave as large as the upper St. Michael's first

chamber. The distance travelled is 2-50 feet fi-oin the entrance, which, added to

the distance (200 feet) travelled in the first discovered cavern, make a total of
450 feet of hitherto whoUj' unknown caverns in so familiar a locality as the often-

·\dsited cave of San Migael.

At the date of his last advices. Captain Brome was continuing the exploration

of St. INIichael's Cavern, with every prospect of further interesting discoveries.

But, as he says, " his surmises, that the unexplored caves would yield the same

relies as the Genista CaveiTi, have been verified, and the fact is nearly, if not quite

established, that at a former period all the Gibraltar' caverns were tenanted by a

race havinsi' uniform habits of liviujj'."

Enumeration of British Graptolites. By William Caeeuthees, F.L.S.

   The genus was established hy Linureus, in the first edition of his ' Systenia
Natiirse/ for a series of natiu-al productions which had previously been considered

to be true fossils. In the genus, as it appeared in the early editions, not a single

species of the fossils to which the name is now confined was included. No alte-
ration was introduced into the genus until the twelfth edition, when G. scalaris

appears, which had already been figured by Liiuiaeus in his Scanian travels. This

is the true t^'pe of the family, and the only species with which Linnseus was
acquainted. The single-celled graptolite, which has by every one been referred to

Linnreus's G. Sagittarius, has nothing whatever to do with the organism to which

he gave this name. His species is founded on a fragment of Lepidoclendron figiu-ed

by \^olkmanu. To coiTect this error, and to make the extent of the acquaintance

which Linufeus had with these fossils more obvious, it was proposed to substitute

the name G. Ilisiiu/cri for the species, after the distinguished palaeontologist who

first described the species, but eri'oueously gave it the Linnean name. The whole

of the species were included by Murchison, Portlock, and others in the original

Linnean genus. New genera were introduced by Barrande, M'Co}-, Hall, Salter,

and the author. The various genera were then described, their different charac-
Ateristics noticed, and the number of species given.
                                                      new genus, Ci/rtoffra2}siis,

was proposed for a singular form from the Wenlock of England, of which a single

species only has been observed occiu-ring both in England and Bohemia, and

which the author dedicated to the distinguished author of 'Siluria.' The netted

forms which had been refeii'ed to this family had been carefully examined by the

author, but he could not satisfy himself as to their affinities, and for the present

must exclude them.

                            On Calamitece and Fossil Equisetacece.
                       By William Caeetjthers, F.L.S., F.G.S.

     After describing tlie structure of tlie recent EquisetacecE, tlie author gave an
 account of the internal structure of the various fossil stems which had been refen-ed
 to this family. True Equisetacece were rare as fossils, and the stems of Calamites

 were very unlilie anything known among liA'ing acotyledonous plants. The most
 important characters were obtained by botanists from the fructification. The
 author had obtained, through the kindness of Br. liooker, sections of vegetable
 structures prepared by Mr. Biuney, whose extensive acquaintance with coal-plants
was weU known. In some of these he had discovered fruits which belonged to
 Calamites so beautifully presened that the most minute details could be deter-

 mined, and with the help of his diagrams he described their structure, and illus-
trated the various points in which thej^ agreed with, and differed from, the fruits

oi Equisetacece. He then described the foliage which had been found connected

with Calamites, and which had been named Asteroph/Uites ; and he showed that
as similar fruits had been found associated with Annularia and Spheitophj/Uum,
which difiered from AsterophyUites only in the amount of cellidar tissue spread out
on the veins, there could be no doubt that these also were the foliage of members

of this large genus or tribe of plants.

   On the Geoloyy of North Formosa. By Dr. Collingavood, M.A., F.L.S.

   The author presented a geological section, made by himself, across the north
part of the island of Formosa, from Tam-sug in the west, to Pe-ton Point in the
east. The neighbourhood of Tam-sug was remarkable for an abundant collection
of angular and rounded boulders, imbedded in a thick deposit of alluvium.
Further west calcareous grit prevailed, rising into hills, where the strata cropped

out at an angle of 15° to the north-east. Among these hills sulphur springs were

found, in which the sulphur issued in a sublimed state with jets of steam from

crevices in the rocks. On the north-eastern side of the island lied Sandstone
rocks prevailed, having the same inclination, and among them were situated the

coal deposits, which rendered Kelung an important harbour.

   The author described the geological structure of several small islands which he
had visited, including the Pescadores (or Ponghou archipelago), which presented
some remarkable basaltic formations, resembling in character the Antrim coast.
Haitan islands, on the Chinese coast, composed of whinstone trap, granite, and
other volcanic rocks ; also two small groups of islands north-cast of Formosa, seldom
visited, consisting of Craig, Pinnach, and Agincourt islands, and Hoa-pin-su,
Tia-usu, Pinnacle Rock, and Raleigh Rock, respectively. The complicated struc-
ture of some of these islands was described by the aid of diagi-ams.

                       By F. GoEDOx Davis, Minimj Engineer,

   The deposits of calamine are invariably situated in Silurian limestone, on or
near the summit of a mountain, and often forming the saddle between two high
peaks. The direction they take (with only two exceptions) is north and south,
parallel to the strike of the limestone, and connected with north and south lead
lodes, though not often actually in their run. The deposits varv from fi^o to
twenty-five fathoms in width, and fifty to eighty fathoms in length : sometimes
several deposits are situated in n line, and thus form runs of ore ground 250 to -000
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  59

fathoms in leugtb. The depth to which these deposits extend has not yet been
ascertained. At Monte Poui mine calamine forms the cap of the rich lead deposit.

   The ore is a mixture of the silicate and carbonate of zinc.
   The author considers that the deposits are being worked in too recldess a

manner.

On some Mammalian Remains from the suhmerged Forest in Barnstaple Baij,

                    Devonshire. By Henry S. Ellis, F.R.A.S.

   The author exhibited a collection of bones, teeth, charcoal, masses of 03'ster and

cockle shells, flint flakes and cores, nnbrokeu flints, masses of peat and clay, broken
pebbles, and specimens of bog-oak and other trees, foimd by him in a certain part
of the submerged forest in Barnstaple Bay ; also a part of a stake of the row referred

to in the paper. The paper was illustrated by a map and sections.
   The submerged forest is situated outside the Northam Pebble Ridge, and is of

considerable extent ; but the bones, flint flakes, charcoal, and shells have as yet
been foimd in a spot (only a few yards square) at the northern end of it, at a dis-

tance of about 200 yards fi'om the Pebble Ridge, and about 300 yards from the

newly-erected baths.

   The author states that during the last few years patches of clay and peat have

--become exposed on the surface of the previously smooth sandy beach of Northam
   that whilst on a visit to the adjacent newly -built watering place, Westward Ho,
in the summer of 1866, he discovered large quantities of flint flakes imderneath

--some of the patches refen-ed to that in the summer of this year (1867) he found,

near the same spot, the bones, teeth, charcoal, &c. exhibited to the Section.
   The author's diagram showed that the patches of clay and peat were laid bare,

and stood eight or nine inches above the level of the sand, and at about that depth
the flint flalces are found imbedded in the clay ; that the bones, teeth, and charcoal
are in some places mixed with them, but generally underlie them, and that the
large masses of cockle-shells and comminuted oyster-sheUs lie underneath the

whole.

   Some of the bones and teeth have been examined by an eminent comparative
anatomist, who pronoimces most of them to be those of Cerrus elaphus, and sug-
gests that a fragment of one of them belonged to some bird. The bones are, for
the most part, in good condition, having sharp fractures, and some of them appear
not to have lost their animal matter. The flint flakes and cores are generally

admitted to be remarkably good specimens of the well-known type described by
Sir John Lubbock, as those of the first stone period. The flakes vary in length
from half an inch to two inches (those found in the peaty clay are purple, but those
ixom. near the masses of cockle- and oyster-shells are opaque-white). All have
very keen edges, and are not serrated, a fact which doubtless arises fi-om each
flake being separately imbedded in clay. Some of the patches of peaty clay con-
tain roots and prostrate branches of trees, and others leaves of a large Iris, in
perfect condition, only faded in colom-. The common yellow Iris, or flag {Iris
2)seudo-acorus) grows luxuriantly in the immediate neighbourhood.

   The author mentions that deers' antlers have been occasionally dredged up in
the bay, and quotes a local tradition that the oak-trees used for the roof and seats
of the church of Braimton (which is situated on the northern edge of the delta of
the Taw) grew in a forest which formerly occupied the site of the Northam
Burrows, and that the trees, when felled, were drawn to the church by reindeer.

A species of red deer still exists in its wild state on Exmoor.

   The author submits that the collection is of interest on account of the various
objects, in such a good state of preservation, having been foimd associated together
iu a locality which is covered by the sea at eveiy tide to a depth of at least twelve

feet, and at so great a distance from the present boundary of dry land. He admits

tliat the burial of the bones in peaty clay underneath sand would naturally tend to
their long preservation and protection; but he thinks the general belief of the
parishioners of Northam, that the sea is constantly and rapidly encroaching on the
land, is worthy of much consideration in forming an estimate of the remoteness of

the period when man left those interesting indications of his existence.

                     By C. Le Nete Fostee, B.A., D.Sc, F.G.S.

    These mines are situated near the town of Philipstad. The ore, which is ma<T-
 netite, occurs in the form of more or less thick deposits, pai-allel to the beddinop of
 the surroimding rock. The rock, or " country," is hiiUeJiinta, which is regarded by
 Swedish geologists as a very fine-grained gneiss. In the immediate neighbour-
hood of the ore, however, the " coimtry " consists of a rock made up of garnet,
hornblende, epidote, and varieties of augite ; limestone is sometimes present. The
 author then compared these Swedish deposits with some \&vy smaU beds of mag-
 netic iron ore found in the Crown's Rock, Botallack Mine, St. Just, Cornwall.
The magnetite occurs here imder veiy similar conditions. Both deposits were
considered to have existed originally in the form of beds in sedimentary rocks,
like the Cleveland iron ore for instance, and to have been since metamorphosed
the fact that the ore is accompanied by garnet, hornblende, &c., is explained by
the supposition that it was the ore that furnished the iron which enters into the

composition of these minerals.

        An Account of the Progress of the Geological Survey of Scotland.
                                  By A. Geikie, F.li.S.

   The author showed the mode in which the sui-vey is carried on, describing par-
ticularly the manner of filling in the geological features of each district of the
country on the Ordnance Siu-vey ]Maps. Upwards of 3000 square miles altogetlier
have already been surveyed. Hitherto the work has been kept back by the small-
ness of the staff and the backward state of the Ordnance Survey; but the staff has
now been largely increased, and as the Ordnance Survey ^laps of the whole of the
south of Scotland are now ready, the work will be much more rapidly proceeded
with. The area geologically surveyed includes the district from the mouth of the
Tay to Berwicli on Tweed, and fi'oni the eastern end of Strathearu to the sources
of the Tweed ; also portions of the counties of Ayr, Wigtown, Kirkcudbright,
Lanark, and Ecnfrew. Five sheets of the one-inch map have been published, and
others are in preparation. Maps on the scale of six inches to one mile have been

issued for the coal-fields of Edinburgh, Haddington, and Fife, and others for the

Ayi'shire coal-field are engraving. Two sheets of horizontal sections acro.ss Edin-

biu-ghshu'e and Haddingtonshire have been published ; also one sheet of vertical
sections of the Edinburgh coal-field. Three memoirs, descriptive of Sheets 32, 33,

and 34 of the one-inch map have appeared. Large collections of fossils and rock-
specimens have been made in the course of the sm-vey.

Oil Tertiary and Quaternary Deposits in the Eastern Counties, with reference

  to Periodic Oscillations of Level and Climate. By the Rev. J. Gunx,

   M.A., F.G.S.

   The author stated that periodic changes in the level of land and water and of

(·limature had been assigned by men of science to astronomical causes ; and that

imder the impression that if such were the fact, the effects of such periodic changes

might still be traceable, he had examined the Tertiary strata in the Eastern

Counties.

He specified and described at length three several oscillations of level from the

period of the forest-bed to the termination of the glacial epoch ; and after pointing

out advantages in many respects derived from thus tracing the sequence of strata,

he expressed a hope that others might be led to make a similar inquiry in older

beds, so as to ascertain whether the supposed relation between astronomical and

geological cycles holds good or not.

The author was of opinion that, considering the length of time that had elapsed

since the cojnmencement of historical evidence, during wliich scarcelv anj' geo-

logical change was pereejitible, the precessional cycle was too .short, and that such

changes must be referred to a longer cycle, to v.'hich the precessional was sub-

ordinate                                  and lie further indulged in the hope that, if tJie length of the cycle were
                                       ;

ascertained, and the numbers of such oscillations counted, supposing, of course, that

the relation between the two were established, an approximation could be made to

the age of certain portions of the crust of the earth.

                       On the Con'iston Group of the Lalce District.

      By Professor Hakkness, F.R.S., and Dr. H. A. NiCHOLSoif, F.G.S.

   After describing the range of the Coniston Limestone, a group of strata the

position and age of which had been pointed out many years ago by Prof Sedg-

wick, the authors referred to a mass of black shales which rests conformably on
these limestones, and which have yielded them a series of fossils new to the
horizon in which they occur. These fossils consist of eleven species of Graptolites
five of which belong to the genus Dij^ograpsus, five to Graptolites, and one to
Mastrites. These black shales, which are conformable to the Coniston Limestone,
are also conformably succeeded by the Coniston Flag group of Prof. Sedgwick, and
they are intercalated with the lower portion of this group. Upon the Coniston
flags the Coniston grits of Prof. Sedgwick occur, and the latter are also conform-

able to the former.

   The Coniston gTits have fossils in them, some of which have not been hitherto
fotmd in the Upper Silurian rocks of Great Britain ; this circumstance, taken in
connexion with the conformability of the whole of the Coniston series, induce the
authors to infer that there exists in tlie Lake country a mass of rocks which pro-
bably attain a thickness of nearly 7000 feet above the Bala limestone and below
the Upper Llandovery which have no equal representatives elsewhere in the British

Isles.

        On the Old Sea-cliffs and Submarine BanTcs of the Frith of Forth.
                                         Bjj D. Milne Home.

   The author explained the line of old sea-clifF along both sides of the Frith of
Forth, which had been formed before the last change in the relative levels of sea

and land. He mentioned that its height at the lower parts of the estuary was

about 1-3 or 14 feet above the present high-water spring- tides, whilst near Stirling it

"was about 31 feet, and to the west about 35 or 40 feet. The autlior also specilied
two higher and older clitfs at heights of about 60 feet and 130 feet respectively.

He referred to the places where skeletons of whales and seals had been found at

heights varying from 18 to 23 feet above the present level of high-water mark, and

--stated that sea-shells were found in two conditions viz. first, in undisturbed beds

now 14 and 15 feet above high-v^^ater mark, where they were entire and perfect
and, 2ndly, in beaches, where they were broken. He also referred to the ancient

deltas, or heaps of gravel and debris at the level of the old cliff", to be seen at dif-

ferent places, as at Menstrie, Alva, and Tillicoidtry. He explained the origin of the

estuary of the Frith, by the great east and west fractm-es in the countiy adjoining

to the north and south. He said that in the Fife coal-field, the downcasts were

almost all on the south side of the fi-actures, and amounted altogether to nearly
2000 feet ; and in the coal-field of the Lothians, Linlithgow, aucl Stirlingshire, the
downcasts were, on the other hand, to the north, and even to a greater extent, thus

producing a trough or hollow, now filled by an arm of the sea. The rocks in this

hollow were covered by various drift-deposits, the oldest being boulder-clay, and,
over it beds of stratified clay, sand, and gravel. The gravel was generally on the
top, which was accounted for by the water of the estuary shallowing, whereby the

currents became more powerful, and thus gravel was laid down where only mud
or sand could be laid down before.

   The author next proceeded to describe a long ridge of gravel rimning fom* or five

miles through Callendar Park, by Polmont eastward towards Linlithgow. He

stated that its height was from 30 to 60 feet, and, judging from the materials com-

posing it, he considered it had been formed by sea-currents. He said that these

gravel ridges were very numerous in our open valleys, and that their direction or
course was invariably parallel with the axis or sides of the valley. Though he had
not seen the ridge of gravel at St. Fort, described in Dr. Chambers's paper, he could
not help thinking it was to be accounted for in the same way, viz. by marine cur-
                          --;

rents, and not as an eifect of ice action. He exliibited some Admiralty charts,

sliowing the submarine banks and spits existing in the English Channel, all of
"which were in like manner parallel to the sea-coast. If this bank was formed in
that way, the sea must have stood at least .350 feet higher than now; and, in that
idew, an explanation was aftbrded of several phenomena in the district, such as the
smoothed appearance of the hard whinstone rocks of Stirling, Craigforth, Airthrej-,

Castleton, and Logic. He thought it, however, not at all improbable that ice then

floated on the sea; otherwise he could'not account for the position of some enormous
boulders which he described situated to the east of Stirling, and which evidently

had been in some way carried to their present positions. He next adverted to the

fact of the old beach-line sloping upward to the westward, there being a rise of at

least 20 feet. He did not consider this owing to any unequal rising of the land
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

he thought it might be explained by the laws of tidal action. He knew a different
explanation had been given of the old beach-lines of the Altenliord of Norway
but, whatever may he the case there, this theory of unequal elevation need not be
resorted to for the estuary of the Forth. He next adverted to the o^nnion recently

expressed, that the last change of relative levels between sea and land had occiu-red
since the occupation of this country hj the Romans. In that opinion he could not

concur. Several facts militated against it. If the sea covered the extensive plains

to the west of Stirling, up to the old sea-cliiF shown on the map, it would have
been impossible for the Romans to have had their road, which had been discovered
across the moss of Kincardine, or to have had their fort on the banks of the river
below Stirling. Moreover, the caves hollowed out bj' the sea at Wemyss, in Fife,
before the last change of the relative levels, must then have been occupied by the
sea, and therefore the remarkable sculptures found on their walls, lately described
by Sir Jame.s Simpson, must have been executed since the Romans left our island,
a notion which, he believed, all archteologists would repudiate. In conclusion, he
expressed a hope that some one would undertake a survey of the old sea-cliffs con-
nected with the estuary of the Tay, as he had no doubt they would lead also to
interesting conclusions, and serve to check the results he had arrived at after exa-
mining the estuary of the Forth.

    South- easierhj Attenuation of the Carboniferous Sedimenfari/ Hocls of the

   North of England. By Edward Hvll, B.A., F.R.S., of the Geolor/iccd Sur-

   vey of Scotland. (Communicated ivith the consent of the Director- General.)

   The author stated that the completion of the Geological Sun-ey of a large por-
tion of South Lancashire had enabled him to arrive at the conclusions stated in

this paper.

   Alter describing the general trend of the Pendle range of hiUs throughout a
distance of about thirtj' miles, from the neighbourhood of Lathoni Park on the
south-west to that of Colne on the north-east, the author showed that along this
range, and especially at Pendle Hill itself, the "sedimentary" strata of the Car-
boniferous group attains a vertical development surpassing that of the same beds
in any part of Great ]3ritain. Several carefully-measured sections in the neigh-
bourhood of Buniley gave the following results :

1. Middle Coal-measiu'es (only partially represented in this district).

2. Lower Coal-measures    2,000 feet thick.

3. Millstone-grit series  .5,.500 ,,     ,,
4. Yoredale series                       ,,
                          5,025 ,,

                          Total 12,-525  }>

Aiid if to this be added the beds of the IMiddle and Upper Coal-measures which
occur in South Lancashire, but have been removed by 'denudation from off the
Burnley district, a total thickness of 18,785 feet would be the amount of thickness
which "the "sedimentary" beds alone of the Carboniferous group originally attained

in this part of England.
    This estimate excludes the Carboniferous limestone, which, for special reasons,

the author maintains ought not to be classed with the truly " sedimentaiy " portion
of the gi'oup.

   Comparing the thiclmess of these beds in the Pendle district with that of the
same formations in the direction of the Midland Counties, as ascertained during the
progress of the Ceological Survey, the following were found to he the relative

proportions

                           On the Goldjields of Scotland *.
               By W. LiTjDER Lendsat, M.D., F.E.S.E., F.L.S.

   The autlior's conclusions are based on

  1. Personal survey of the gold-fields of New Zealand. It was while visiting in

1861 the auriferous districts of the Province of Otago that he was struck with the

similarity, as respects physical geographj' and geology, between that country and

many parts of Scotland, and with the probable parallelism as respects the distribu-

tion of gold.

   2. Personal comparative survey of Scotland, and its principal outlying islands,

since his return to Scotland in 1862, in order to determiiie how far such a paral-

lelism really exists.

   ·3. Inspection of the specimens of gold and gold-rocks in the principal inter-

national exhibitions and national museums of ^Britain and France, Australia, and

New Zealand.

    4. Comparative study of the literatiu'e of gold in Scotland and other auriferous

countries.

His special conclusions as regards the Scottish gold-fields are founded mainly

on

1. The similarity of the rocks (Lower Silurian) of a great part of Scotland to

those of most other auriferous countries.
   2. The abundance in Scotland of the minerals with which gold is most commonly

associated in the richest auriferous countries; e. r/.,

    a. Metallic oxides (iron and copper) : magnetic ironsaud, containing (or not)

            oxide of titanium.

   6. Metallic sulphides (iron, copper, lead ; and zinc).
.3. The actual discovery of gold, both in recent and former times, at various points

between the extreme north and south of Scotland.

  --His propositions concerning the gold-fields of Scotland are, that

   I. Gold is much more extensively or generally diffused over Scotland than has

been hitherto supposed.

   II. The Scottish gold-fields may bo divided geographically or topographically

into two great areas, viz. the

    (A.) Great Northern, which is naturally subdivided by the Caledonian Canal.

            The northern half occupies the longitudinal axis of the northern penin-

            sula of Scotland, and comprises the greater part of the counties of

            Sutherland and Ross, and of Inverness and Argyle north of the Cale-
            donian Canal. The southern half lies between the said canal and the
            valley of the Tay, and forms a transverse belt across Scotland, com-

            prising a great part of the shires of Inverness and Argyle south of the

            canal; and of Aberdeen, Bauft^ Kincardine, Perth, Forl'ar, Stirling, and

                 Dmiibarton-shires.

    --(B.) Southern includes great part of Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, Wigton, Ayr,

            Selkirk, Peebles, and Lanark-shires ; and more particularly parts of

            the districts of Nithsdale, Annandale, Eskdale, Ettrickdale, Tweeddale,

            --and Clydesdale ;  Carrick                                      and  the Lammermuirs (in Haddington and
                                                                          ;

            Berwick) all south of the Forth.

III. Actual discoveries of gold have been made at different times in the follow-

ing localities :

   --(A.) Sutherlandshire Kildonan on Helmsdale Water.
   --(B.) Perthshire 1. Breadalbane : area of Loch Tay and head waters of the

                  Tay (Tyndrum and Taymouth).

          2. Upper Strathearn : area of Loch Earn and head waters of the Earn
                  (Cxlen Leduock : streams falling from the north into Loch Earn
                  Ardvoirlich, south side of Loch Earn ; Glenturrit).

       --3. Gleualmond : Glenquoich and other valleys of the Grampians.

    (C.) Forfarshire Clova district : " Braes of Angus," Edzell, and Glenesk.

            deen).

(H.) Dumfriesshire : Headwaters of the Annan (Moffiitdale : streams falling

           into Moftat water ; Hartfell range above Dobbs Linn).

IV. The richness of the Scottish gold-tields is illustrated by the following

facts*:--

(A.) The limited area of the Leadhills yielded at one time (sixteenth century),

           to systematic working, half a million worth of gold.

(B.) Li various public or private museums mtggets of Scotch gold are exhibited

            of the following weights :

       =(1) 2 lbs. 3 oz. =27 oz. 12,960 grs. ; worth at current price of gold in
            =Australia ( £4 per oz.) £108 : Leadhills : collected about 1502 : the

               largest mass of native gold recorded as having been found within

                historic times in Scotland.

       =(2) 2 oz. 960 grs. : Breadalbane.
       =(3) 1 oz. 10dwts. 720grs. : Leadhills.

       (4) 10dwts.=240gi-s. : Kildonan.

       (5) 30 grs.: Leadhills (1863).

       (6) 6 grs. : Moflatdale (1863).
       (7) Nuggets of 2 or 3 grs. are frequently found at LeadhiUs at the pre-

           sent day.

   V. Geologically the area of the Scottish gold-fields corresponds to that occupied
by the Lower Silurian strata and their drifts : in the south represented b)^ the
greywackes and graptolitic slates of the Lowthers ; in the north by the micaceous

schists of the Grampians.

   VI. Gold in Scotland is not, however, necessarily confined to the Silurian area.

In other countries it has been found in rocks of so many different characters and

ages, that it is impossible to predicate gold will not be found in any given district

or rock in Scotland. In particular, gold has been found in Laurentian rocks in

Canada, Nova Scotia, and Sweden ; hence it may at least be looked for in the area

of Laurentian gneiss in Scotland, viz. in the Hebrides and western seaboard of

Sutherland and Ross-shires. In Canada it occurs also in TJpper Silurian strata

so that it is possible our Pentlands may prove to be auriferous. In California,

NewAustralia,  Zealand, and other auriferous countries, gold occurs in rocks of

more recent age, as well as in granites, syenites, sandstones and limestones, and

their debris, apparentl)' of very different ages.

   VII. The area of diffusion of gold in Scotland, and the extent to which it occurs,
can only be determined by systematic investigation, equivalent at least to the

"prospecting" of gold-diggers.

VUI. Hitherto, with certain limited and local exceptions, there has been no such

systematic gold "prospecting" in Scotland.

   IX. "Prospecting" for gold should form part of the duties of the staff" of the

National Geological Survey of Scotland. From its simplicity it is, moreover, an

operation quite within the powers of all classes of the community, who possess,

with the necessary interest in the subject, the requisite leisure and local opportunity.
   X. There are indications (if they do not always amoimt to proofs) of the exist-

-- --ence in Scotland of auriferous quaHzites of gold in situ as well as of auriferous

"d)-ifts" and "alluvial gold." Gold in its matrix has been apparently found at

least in Leadhills, Tweeddale, and Breadalbane.

  XL At the present high rates of wages for skilled labour, and with the present

rude appliances for its collection, gold-gathering in Scotland is not apparently remu-

the gold tores and other ornaments of prehistoric age found in different parts of our

country were, there is every reason to believe, tlie produce of native gold.

nerative as a regular and separate industry. It is remunerative only to those classes of
the population the value of whose labour does not exceed 3f/. per day, the wages of
lead-mining averaging 15s. per week. But the Leadhills miners tind it a profitable
occupation for their leisure hours, and they obtain a ready market for considerable
quantities at prices varying from 6d. to 7^(1. per grain=£12 to £15 per oz. Gold
to the extent of 500 to 1000 grs. is occasionally collected in Leadhills in a few days

for the local proprietors.

   XII. Before it can be properly discussed how far, or whether gold-washing is

destined again to become a national industry in Scotland, it must be determined
what is the extent and richness of the Scottish gold-fields. Present data are of the
most imperfect and unsatisfactory kind for determining this point.

   XIII. Many improvements have been made of late years in the process of extract-

ing gold from its matrix and diifts ; their efiect has been to render it remunerative
to collect gold which exists in quantities fonnerly considered too small to be
profitable to work. Hence, in so far as the processes hitherto adopted in Scotland

have been of the most primitive kind, it is possible it may yet be found expedient
systematically to work on the most modern plan some, at least, of the gold-

deposits of Scotland.

    Regarding it as a ti/pe of the Scottish gold-fields, the author described in detail the

gold and gold-rocks of Leadhills (to which he made a special visit in the autumn
of 18G3), pointing out the numerous parallelisms between it and the Tuapeka gold-

field of Otago, New Zealand. He instituted certain other comparisons, e.g. between

the gold-fields of Scotland and those of Himgary (Transylvania), especially as
regards the remunerativeness of gold-washing to gipsies and other idle or nomad
classes of the population. In conclusion, he indicated the present vigorous ope-
rations of gold-mining or washing companies in Wales and Ireland as an encourage-
ment to systematic investigation in Scotland.

            Sur TAncien Glacier de la Vallee cVArgeles clans les Pyrenees.
                       Par Charles Maetins et Edo jaed Collomb.

   Tons les geologucs sont d'accord pom- admettre que les vallees des Alpes, des
Vosges et des Pyrenees ont t5te occupees pendant I'epoque quatemaire par d'im-

menses glaciers qui descendaient souvent dans les plaines voisines. La carte de

I'aucienne extension des glaciers des Alpes et des "Vosges a 6te faite ; celle des
glaciers pyreneens ne Test point encore. Dans ce travail nous comniencerons a
combler cette lacune en decrivant le plus grand des glaciers du versant fran^ais
des Pyrenees, celui qui provenant des sommets les plus Aleves de la chaine centrale
s'est avancS la plus loin dans la plaine.

    C'est autour des pics de Neouvielle, Long, de Vignemale, et dans les cirques de
Gavarnie et de Troumouse, qu'on retrouve encore les faibles restes du gi-and gla-
cier qui occupait jadis la vallee d'Argeles et ses afiiuens; il descendait de la crete
des Pyi-enees frontiere de la France et de I'Espagne et ses racines s'etendaient de

I'ouest a Test depuis le Pic de Cuje-Palas jusqu'a celui de Sen-e-Mourene. La

vallee principale, celle d'Argeles, aboutissait en se ramifiant aux vastes cirques de
Gavarnie, des Oulettes, d'Estaube et de Troumouse ou d'Heas. Ces cirques deja
tres-eleves, sont domines par des sommets dont I'altitude est comprise entre 7500 et
9760 pieds anglais. Le glacier principal avait trois grands afnuens: celui de la
vallee de Cauterets, celui de la vallee d'Arrens, et celui de Barreges. Sa longueur
totale depuis les Tours de Marbore, jusqu'au village d'Ade dans la plaine de Tarbes,
ou sont ses demieres moraines terminales, etait de 35 milles marius. Cette longueur
n'a rien qui doive nous etonner, puisqu'il existe encore dans rilymalaya des gla-
ciers plus longs que celui de la vallee d'Argeles.

    Pour etudier les traces que cet ancien glacier a laissees apres lui, transportons-
nous au centre du cirque de Gavarnie. Sur les assises cretacees et tertiaires qui

qui sont les restes de celui que nous allons etudier ; mais ils ne depassent pas les

bords des gi-adius qui les supportent. Dans le cirque memo de Gavarnie nous

 trouvons la derniere moraine terminale de I'ancien glacier composee de blocs cal-

vallee qui, succedant au cirque, s'etend de ce -village a celui de Gedre, preseute deux

longues^ terrasses paralleles, elevees de 2050 pieds environ au-dessus de la vallee.

L une a droite, appelee la JMontagne de Coumely, forme le piedestal des pics de

Pimene et de Larrue                                                                     c'est une ancienne  moraine dont la surface  oudulee est cou-

verte de paturages et parsemee de granges a foin. La terrasse opposee, appelee

Montague de Saugue, est composee de scliistes bvmis et de quartzites, h formes

moutonnees, quelquefois polies et striees par Taction de I'ancien glacier. Sans

s elever sur ces terrasses, le geologoie pent se convaincre sui" la gi-ande route de
Gavarnie a Gedre que le glacier a poll et iisiS les escarpemens de la gorge ou se
trouve I'eboulement appele le Chaos, et avant d'y arriver il remarquera sur la droite
de la route un monticule composiS de roclies moutonnees, polies, striees et por-
tant des blocs erratiques. ])e seniblables roclies se remarquent encore sur la di-oite
de la route a la descente sur le village de Gedre. Pres de ce village, M. Emilien
Frossard a vu dans les d(5blais entrepris pour le trac6 de la nouvelle route, des blocs

eiTatiques de gres cretace jaune et friable, avec Ostrca carinata, provenant du

cii-que de Gavarnie. Entre Gedre et Luz, on remarque en aval du triple pont de la
Scia, pres du ton-ent de Lassariou, im roclier schisteux eutierement convert do

blocs gi-anitiques.

    Arriv(3 a Luz, I'ancien glacier de la vallee d'Ai-geles refevait le puissant affluent
de la vallee de Barreges. II etait interessant d'etudier les traces qu'il a laissees

dans ce point. Place sur le Pont de Luz a St. Sauveui", le voyageur peut apperce-
voir les Woes erratiques blancs qui entourent les gxanges d'Abi^. Ces gi-anges sont

construites en granite, et Tun de nous s'est assiu'e par le barometre que les derniers
blocs etaient a 2770 pieds au-dessus du gave sous le Pont Napoleon. Peneteons dans

I'etroite gorge de Pierrefitte, et nous y verrons des lambeaus morainiques reconverts

de gras paturages plaques contre le flanc gauche de la montagne. Au sortir de la

gorge, sur la droite et au niveau de la route, les schistes sont polis siu- leur tran-

chant, lustres et creuses par des marmites-de-geant (2'>ot-holes) a section circiilaire.

La le^ glacier recevait le plus puissant de ses affluens, celui qui lui apportait les

materiaux erratiques les plus nombreux et les plus indestructibles, les granites de
la vallee de Cauterets. Le Pic de Viscos, si remarquable par sa forme pyramidale,

etait le promontoire au pied duquel se reunissaient les deux glaciers, comparable a

VAbschwunff, qui separe les glaciers actuels du Lauteraar et du Finsteraar, dont la

reunion  forme  MM.le glacier de I'Aar, si bien etudie par                                                  Agassiz,                 Desor, Vogt,  et

Dollfus-Ausset. Une inunense moraine laterale gauche, parfaitement dessin^e sur

la feuille 251 de la carte de France, s'etend de I'entree de la gorge de Cauterets
jusqu'a St. Savin. L'un de nous en compag-nie de Mr. Arthiu- Jones, a 6tudie plus

specialement son extremite meridionale au-dessus du village d'Arcizans, situe prea
d'Argeles d'ou Ton aperfoit les flancs de la montagne d'Escorne-Crabe di^chires

par des ravins creuses dans des terrains meubles. Pour un ceil exerc(5 ce sont d'an-

ciennes moraines formant une terrasse dont le niveau moyen est a 2375 pieds au-

dessus du Pont de Filhos, pres d'Argeles. Du haut de cette terrasse on s'assure que

le Pic de Gez qui domine Ai'geles et s'tSleve a .3290 pieds au-dessus de la mer, est
entierement convert de blocs gi'anitiques, preuve que le glacier a acquis siu- ce point
a une epoque de grande extension I'epaisseur considerable de 2045 pieds au moins.

La ville d'Argeles est elle-meme batie sur une moraine granitique fort basse con-es-

pondante a 1 epoque de retrait du glacier : couverte de chataigniers elle s'etend sous
laforme d'une longue coUine en aval d'Argeles jusqu'au village d'Oost jouant a la
fois le role de moraine laterale gauche pour le gi'and glacier d'ili-geles, et celui de
moraine terminale pour celui affluent par la vallee de Salles.

   Nous voici parvenus a I'extremite inferieure de la Vallee d'Argeles ; a droite est

le Pic de Jer qui s'eleve a 2895 pieds au-dessus de la mer. De la route on appercoit

les blocs qui sont restes suspendus a ses flancs; mais ils ne montent pas jusqu'au
sommet ; le barometre nous apprit qu'ils s'arretaient a 1300 pieds au-dessus du Gave

de Pau. C'est done I'epaisseur maximum du glacier en ce point, et la moraine dont
nous venons de mesurer la hauteui" etait sa moraine laterale droite. La moraine

mgdiane a reconvert d'lm nombre immense des blocs la Montagne de Beout, qui
s'eleve a 2415 pieds au-dessus de la mer, mais seulement a 123(3 pieds au-dessus de la
riviere. Sur cette Montagne de Beout, le geologue pourra ob.sen-er les blocs

erratiques dans toutes les positions et avec tous les accidens qui out ete depuis long-

spheriques, elle presente ces profonds sillons que les Suisses appellent Karrenfelder,

actuels forment la corniche d'une colonne de glace dent ils ont empeche la_ fusion.

La moraine laterale gauche du glacier se trouve dans la vallt5e de Batsouriguiere, au
pied d'un cone calcaire denude appele Esch, elle est a 1230 pieds au-dessus du Gave

de Pau, et la vallee elle-meme est, pour aiusi dire, remplie de blocs de granite.

Sortons maintenant de la vallee d'Argeles, et etudions la moraine terminale telle

qu'elle se developpe au nord de Lourdes : elle forme un grand arc de cercle, passant

par les villages de Peyrusse, Loubajac, Ade, Tuloz et Arcisac-les-Angles. Eendons-

nous d'abord avec la'foule des pelerins credules a la grotte miraculeuse, ou la jeune

Bernadette pretendit avoir vu la Vierge le 14 Fevrier 1854. Le calcaire jurassique

exploite le long de la route est arrondi, poli et strie partout oil les travaux des ou-

vriers ont mis a nula surface de la roche. Oes strit^s sont dirig^es du S.S.E. au

N.N.O. L'eglise elle-meme est construite sur une roche raoutonu^e, et au dela, la

route priSsente la coupe d'une moraine avec cailloux raves et blocs de granite, de

schiste, de calcaire et d'ophite.
   Pour etudier la portion occidentale de la moraine terminale du glacier de la valine

d'Argeles, il faut suivre le chemin de fer de Lom-des a Pan. Pres de la Gare du rail-
way on trouve les gres cretaces du cirque de Gavarnie a I'etat erratique, et partout dans
les tranchees des granites, des marbres blancs, des schistes, et des gi-os blocs de cal-
caires noirs, rayes et empates dans la bone glaciaire. Si Ton s'(5leve sur les collines qui

dominent le chemin de fer, on les trouve egalement couvertes de blocs presque tons

granitiques, et dont quelques-uns ont jusqu'a quiuze pieds de longueur. De ces

collines on decouvre le petit lac de Lourdes ; il a 1760 yards de long, et est eleve de
1270 pieds au-dessus de la mer. C'est un lac morainique : il est barre a sa partie

inferiem-e qui se termine par une tourbiere, et se di^verse en amont comme d'autres

lacs morainiques, ceux d'Orta, de Varese, de Come, au revers meridional des Alpes,
de Gdrardmer dans le Vosges, de Llyn Llydaw pres du sommet du Snowdon dans
le pays de Galles. Si Ton se dirige de Peyrusse vers IMourles, propriett? de M. Fould,

on suit le bord de la moraine, et Ton recounait que toutes les collines qui entourent le
lac sont couvertes de blocs erratiques, abondans surtout dans les parties couvertes des
fougeres (Pt.eris aquilina) et dans le bois de chenes ou de chiitaigniers. Les plus

gi'os blocs sont entre le lac et le village de Poueyferre ; I'un d'eux de gi-anite blanc
avec mica noir, a 30 pieds de long sur 22 de large. Sur les bords de la route de

Lourdes a Tarbes, on voit t^galement .a un mille et demi de Lourdes, un bloc pyra-

midal de lumachelle, qui marque, poiu- ainsi dire, la limite de la region des blocs.

La vallee de Lourdes a Ade, (^ue le chemin de fer de Tarbes parcourt dans toute sa

longueur, forme, pour ainsi dire, I'axe de la moraine terminale de I'ancien glacier.

Entre Lourdes et Ade, sur vme longueur de deux milles le chemin de fer coupe sept

moraines parfaitement reconnaissables. La derniere apres le village d'Ade, a 50

--pieds de haut ; elle est comme les autres entierement formee de materiaux meubles
    sables, cailloux, blocs meles confusement, et iwrte a sa surface de gros blocs de
Aquartzite et de gi'anite.
                            la suite de cette moraine, la plaine est nivelee et recou-

verte d'un sable argileux jaune, semblable au loess de la vallee duRhin. La pre-

miere colline coupee par le chemin de fer apres Ade est composee de schistes m^ta-

morphiques traversee par un dyke dophite dont les parties exposees a I'air se decom-

posent en boules. Le loess se prolonge dans la direction de Bordeauxjusqu'a Aire,

sur ime longueur de 43 miles. Sur la carte geologique de France de MM. Dufr^noy

et Elie de Beaumont il est colorie comme les sables des Landes dont il diftere

notablement.

La partie orientale de la moraine terminale de I'ancien glacier d'Argeles ne pre-

sente  rien  de  remarquable                                                            seulement nous signalerons  les nombreux                                blocs qui
                                                                                     ;

la rive gauche que sur la rive droite. Quant a la distribution des materiaux, j 'observe
que les gres cretaces et les scbistes devoniens avec Retepora du cirque de Gavar-

nie caracterisent la moraine niediane de I'ancien glacier; les gianites blancs a cristaux

de Tourmaline de la vallee de Cauterets, la moraine laterale gauche ; les ophites et les

quartzites la moraine laterale droite. Cette distribution se retrouve dans la moraine

terminale qui s'etend au nord de Loui'des dans la plaine sous-pyreneenne.

Nous terminerons ce memoire en Ibiunissant une preuve zoologique de la periode

On the Cambrian Hods of Llanheris with reference to a Break in the Conform-
  able Succession of the Lower Beds. By George Maw, F.G.S., F.L.S., 4'c.

  A section was exhibited of the lower part of the Cambrian series along the

southern bank of Ll-\ai Padiirn, which was not visible at the time the Llanberis
district was mapped by the Geological Survey.

  A cutting on the branch railway from Carnarvon, now in course of formation,

has exposed the structure of the lower beds and the most complicated part of the
series. Underneath the beds worked for slates in the Diuorwic and Glyn quar-
ries there occurs a considerable thickness of a compact rock obscurely banded with
dark olive-green and dull bufl", which rests uncouformably on the uptm-ned edges

of a still more ancient slate-rock. Many of the similar dark-green bauds inter-

stratified vnih the workable slates of the higher series, and which have been
grouped with the Cambrian grits and pebble-beds, contain isolated fragments of
altered slate, and wherever they are in contact with the blue or purple slates a

thin course of altered green slate occurs at the junction.

    Towards the lower part of the Upper series in the Glyn quarries the green
matter occurs as a multitude of thin bands, in contact with which the slate has
been altered to a pale green.

   The dark-green bands were found on analysis to exhibit a totally different com-

position to that of the slate-matrix, and appeared to have been derived from a

different som-ce.

   With reference to the condition of fusion under which the dj'kes of gi'eenstonc

were intruded, judging from the kind of alteration produced in the adjacent slate,
the heat could not have been sufficient to effect a pui-ely vitreous liquefaction, as
experiments proved that the slaty matrix was fusible at a lower heat than that at
which the greenstone was refractory.

            On the Nature and Systematic Position of the Graptoliticlce.

            By Henky Axletne Nicholson, D.Sc, M.B., F.G.S., ^c.

   The author of this paper, after stating the views of those who had referred the

Graptolitid£e to the Cephalopoda, the Actinozoa, the Polyzoa, and the Foramimfera,
stated the reasons which induced him to chiss them with the Hydrozoa, a view
originally put forth by Prof. M<Coy. This opinion was shown to be supported by

the moi-phology of the Graptolitidae, and especially by the existence of a " common

canal" corresponding to the "ccenosarc" of the Hydi-ozoa, from which arose the
separate cellules or polypites. As a special morphological point, it was also mdi-
cated that the " central disk " of some Tetragrapsi and Dichograpsi would find
a feasible homologue in the "float" or " pneimiatophore " of the Physophondfe,

an order of the oceanic Hydrozoa.
   Passing from the nutiitive to the generative system, the author drew attention

to the bodies originally described by himself as the "ovarian vesicles" of Grapto-

lites, and also to those previously described by Hall, pointing out their close affinity

with the " gonophores " of the recent Hydrozoa.

   The reference of the Graptolitida; to the Hydrozoa was further shown to be
supported by their mode of existence and by the determination of allied forms.
As regards the former point, proofs were adduced that the great majority, if not

the whole, of the Graptolitidffi were free and unattached, an almost fatal objection

to the belief that they were referable to the Bryozoa. As to the second point,
attention was drawn to the existence of a form (origiually described by the author
under the name of Corynoides calicidaris) which was closely allied^ to the Grap-
tolites, but which probably represented the Corynidaj or Tubularidte in the Silurian

seas.

   The author, in conclusion, declared his belief that the Graptohtidaj could not be
referred to any existing order, or even subclass, of the Hydrozoa, standing there-
fore in the same relation to the latter that the Trilobites do to existing Crustacea.
In the present state of om- knowledge it seemed, therefore, most advisa-ble to con-
sider the Graptolites as constituting a new subclass intermediate iu position
between the oceanic and the fixed Hydrozoa ; and there were some reasons for
the belief that they perhaps represented the original stock, from which the above

existing sections of our living Hydi-ozoa have primarily diverged.

           On the Graptolites of the SJdddmu Slates.
By Henry Alieyne Nicholson, D.Sc, M.B., P.G.S., Sfc.

   The author of this communication gave a brief description of the Graptolitesof
the Skiddaw Slates, a group of rocks forming the base of the gTeat Silurian series
of Cumberland and Westmorland. These Graptolites had been described in 186-3
by Mr. Salter, who gave a list of thirteen species. Eejectiug some of these, the
author was now enabled, by the researches of Prof. Harbiess and himself, to de-
scribe twenty-three species, of which muuber thirteen are well known in the

Quebec "-roup of Canada, three are new, and the remainder occur elsewhere, eitlier
in the Lower or Upper Llandeilo rocks. The author pointed out various peculi-
arities in the forms and distribution of the Skiddaw Graptolites, and showed that

by their aid we were able clearly to correlate the Skiddaw Slates vsdth the Quebec

fiTOup in Canada.

   The Graptolites of the Skiddaw Slates were shown to be referable to six genera
certainly, perhaps to eight. The genus Dichof/rapsus, Salter, was repres^ented by
four species, viz. D. Loffani, Hall, D. octobrachiatus, Hall, D. onultiplex, Nich., and
D. reticulatus, Nich. Of the genus Tciraf/rapsus, Salter, four species had also bueu
identified, viz. T. hryonoides, Hall, T. quadnbrachiatus, Hall, T. Headi, HaU, and

T. cnicifer, Hall.                      doubtfully                                   ,  ,by                                 ·  p

ments apparently referable to I). HcdUamis, Prout, from which i>. furcattda of

Salter appears undistinguishable.

   The genus Pkurograpsus, Nicholson, was also doubtfully represented by a single
new species, provisionally named P. vagans.

   Of the genus Diployrapsus, M'Coy, foiu' species are known from the slates, viz.
72 KEPOiiT-- 1867.

D. pridinifornm, Hall; D. mitcrmiahis, Hall, D. antennarius, Hall, and D, tere-

    Of the genus Didj/moffrapstts, M'Cor, seven species are found, viz. 2). nitidus,
Hall, D. patiihis, Hall (=Z>. kirnndo, Salter), D. serrafrthts, Hall, D. hifidus, Hall,
D. sextans, Hall, i). gemimis, His., and D. V.-fractus, Salter.

    Of the peculiar genus Phjllograpsus, HaU, two species had been recognized, viz.
P. anffiisttfoliiis, Hall, and P. Ujpiis, Hall.

    Of the genus Grapfolites, Linn., four species had been stated to occur by Mr,
Salter, viz. G. saffitfarius, Linn., G. tenuis, Port!, G. Nilssoni, Ban-., and 6^. latus,
M'Coj'; but these determinations had been in all probability founded upon frag-
ments of the compound forms.

On Fossil FisJies of the Old Red Sandstone of Caithness and Sutherland, with
             notices of some new to those Counties. By C. W. Peach.

   The author first mentioned Pterichthys as being abundant in Orkney, but until
186.3 not a vestige of it had been found in Caithness or Sutherland, when in June
of that year he was fortunate enough to turn up, in the thin flaggy beds inter-
calated amongst the coaa-se sandstones near John O'Groat's, an exceedingly small
species, with smaU spined arms, delicately but beautifully sculptured. One
specimen had two horn-like appendages, which turn right and left at right angles,
and, like the others, differs from those found in Orkney, and, if a new species, the
author intends to name it after his late valued friend Robert Dick, so that at least
one thing belonging to the Old Pied Sandstone, for which he did so much, might
bear his worthy name. After a full description of the above, he mentioned Coc-
costeits, describing C. pusilhis of M'Coy, of which he had got nearly a perfect
specimen at !Murkle, near Castlehill. In one he pointed out that the tail was
covered either with scales or a tuberculated skin, a fact not before observed.
Coccosteus trif/onaspis of M'Coy he considered not a good species, it being made
from the lozenge-shaped ventral plate of the above species. M'Coy himself was

doubtful about it.

   From A^'ick Head he had obtained Osteolepis hrevis of M'Co}'. Dipterus he
found was a true bony fish, as might be seen by the specimens produced, showing
vertebral coluum, ribs, processes, and interspinous bones. Of Acanthodes he had

obtained a third species, the Acanthodes pusilliis of Agassiz.

   HoluptycluHs Scdf/icickii he felt sure was also a true bony fish, as seen by the
specimen he exhibited, showing similar internal bones to those noticed as occurring
in Dipterus. All the above fishes were found in Caithness, and as well, probably, a
new Chciracanthus and spines of Diplacanthus lonyispinus. At Dornoch, in Sutlier-
landshire, he had foimd scales of Ilolopti/chius in the sandstones near the sea.

   Tristichtipterus alatus was next alluded to. This really handsome fish was
described by Sir Philip Egerton in Decade X. of the Geological Survey, from im-
perfect specimens exhibited by the author at the Briti.sh Association at Aberdeen,
in ]859; and although described as a true bony fish, its true place could not be
positively made out, from the absence of paired fins, bones of the head, teeth, &c.
Specimens of aU these were produced, and fulh' bore out the conclusion which Sir
Philip Egerton had arrived at when de.scribiiig the one got in 1859. After men-
tioning the probability of his having found (as well as the above) Annelides in
Caithness rocks, he stated that he fully agi-eed with Sir R. I. Murchison, in his
triple arrangement of the Old Red Sandstone in the counties of Caithness and

Sutherland.

           On a new Phosphatic, Deposit near Upware, in Cambridgeshire.

                          By J. P. Walker, B.A., F.G.S. Sfc.

    At the Meeting of this Association at Nottingham, the author conimnnicated a
paper on a phosphatic deposit in Bedfordshire; further light has been thrown
 upon the nature of that bed by the discovery of another deposit near Upware.
The most remarkable difference between these deposits is, that the shells, which the
author regarded as proper to the beds, exist'at Sandy and Pottou in a ferruginous
condition, but in a calcareous condition near Upware. The reason why the same

fossils occur in different conditions in these beds is probably due to the proximity
of a coral-reef to the Upware bed ; for the coral rag occurs at Upware, and a large

supply of calcareous matter would be derived from this source. At Sandy the
casts of the shells are impressions in the ferruginous sand, which forms the matrix
in which the fossils and nodules are imbedded, whilst at Upware casts of these
shells occur composed of carbonate of calcium. The author referred to the water-
worn condition of the phosphatic casts at Potton in his former paper, but the fer-
ruginous nature of that bed was unfavourable for the preservation of the shells
proper to the deposit ; in the Upware bed, however, the calcareous nature of the

deposit is highly favourable for the preservation of the shells proper to the deposit
and therefore the difference between the phosphatic casts and the shells proper to

their respective beds is more marked at Upware than, at Potton. Bnjozoa, Scrindce,
&c. occur on several of the phosphatic nodules at Upware, having evidentlj^ grown
on them, the animal having followed the outline of the nodule, which circumstance
would tend to show that the nodules have been deposited in a hardened condition
in the place where they are found.

   Eemains of the same fishes that are found in the Bedfordshire deposit occur in
this bed ; also of the reptiles, including Dakosaurus and Iguanodon.

   The author gave sections of the Upware deposits in the ' Geological Magazine

--for July 1867, also a list of the fossils ; among these there are a great many species

of Brachiopoda, including three new species W. Wooclwardii, W. Davidsoiiii, and

T. Dallasii (since described in Geol. Mag. October 1867).
   The known species of Brachiopoda found in this deposit are of the Lower-Green-

sand age, including T. Sella, T. lyrcelonga, T. depressa, T. Fittoni, W. 3Iotitoniajut,
&c., R. Gibhsiana, R. antidichotuma, &.c. This bed likewise contains mmaerous
fine specimens of sponges, Bryozoa, kc, resembling those found at Faningdon
and during a recent visit to the latter locality the author obtained several shells
which he has also found at Upware. The author considered these beds at Potton
and Upware to be a drift of the age of the Lower Greensand, containing fossils of

that age as well as extraneous specimens.

BIOLOGY.

Address by the President, Professor "William Shaepet, M.D.,

8ec. B.S., F.B.S.E.

I NEED scarcely remind you that Biology, or the science of the living economy,

in its widest sense comprehends whatever relates to the organization, functions,

and mode of life of living beings, whether plants or animals, as well as their
natural history, that is, their distinctive characters, mutual affinities, systematic
classification, and distribution. On accoimt of the extent and variety of the sub-
jects which come under these heads, the Section of Biology in the British Asso-
ciation has been divided on this as on former occasions into depaitments, which
have been determined, not with a view to logical symmetry of arrangement, but
for the convenient transaction of business. The department of Anatomy and
Physiology, over which I have undertaken more immediately to preside, will
include the structure and functions of man and animals ; that of Zoology and
Botany comprehends the natural history of animals and plants, and will be pre-

sided over by Mr. Busk.
   Om- special science has fully shared in the general advance of human know-

ledge, which goes onward from year to year with steady progress. The area of

ascertained truth is continually widening; the line of contiguity between the

known and the unknown is perpetually extending ; hence more ample room and

multiplied opportunity for passing the frontier and gaining fresh acquisitions in

the unexplored region'^beyond. It has been said that in some fields of science the

harvest has been already reaped, and that those who now come after the great
discoverers of older times are but the gleaners of what they have left behind. To
this opinion I feel sure you will not assent. We, of course, cannot gauge the
absolute amount of work remaining to be done in any sphere of mental activity

but, viewed in relation to man's power of research, the unexplored ground in every

field of scientific inquiry may be deemed practically inexhaustible. The increasing

nmuber of cultivators and the mutual aid which dift'erent branches of science lend

to each other must naturally quicken the rate of advance. Discoveries in one
department speedily find application in other directions, and contribute to onward
progress. One step made in advance renders another possible, and the way is thus

prepared even for those more conspicuous achievements, in discovery of fact or
invention of theory, which at rarer intervals command our admiration. In short,
wdth means of free intercommunication and durable record, the advance of natm-al
knowledge, although not equable and uniform, becomes unbroken and continuous.
In adverting for a'few moments to the present state of anatomy and physiology,

we cannot fail to be impressed by the general prevalence of improved methods of

investigation, and the general use of insti-umeutal and other appliances of gi-eater

power or greater precision in scrutinizing the intimate structure of the body, and
Wein observing, estimating, and recording physiological phenomena.
                                                                    see further

marks of advance in the increasing application of the other sciences, especially
chemistry and physics, to the elucidation of the living economy, and in the readi-

ness with which new discoveries in these sciences are taken advantage of for the
prosecution of anatomical and physiological research. Through these meansmore

extended and more precise data 'are obtained for the discovery or recognition of

prevailing laws and the construction of rational theory ; and physiology is ac-

quiring niore and more the character of an exact study. It is now two centuries

since the microscope was first used in anatomical and phj'siological inquiries, and

--yet I can remember the time when its use might have been considered exceptional
   when, at any rate, it was confined to a very few hands; but now it might

almost be said that no physiologist or natm-alist is without one. Great improve-

ments are continually being made in the potency, precision, and convenient appli-

cation of the instrument ; and signal advantage has been gained from the use of
Weappropriate reagents for facilitating microscopical investigation.
                                                                      need not

look abroad for examples ; some of the most important ii-uits of recent micro-

scopical inquiry are due to the zeal and sagacity ot our own coimtrymeu. I need

refer ;ouly to the discoveries concerning the intimate structure of the nervous

system ; and, without invidious selection, I may more especially signalize the well-
T KANSACTIONS OV THK SKCTIONS.  75

known researches of Mr. Lockliart Clarke on the nervous centres, which, I am

--liappy to say, he continues successfully to prosecute, the discoveries of Professor
--Beale on the structui-e of ganglions and of nerve-fibres, and their ultimate distri-

bution in the tissues and organs, and the interesting observations of JMi-. Hulke

on the retina. By usmg high microscopic powers, with the greatest address and

skill, Dr. Beale found out exquisitely minute fibrils in the peripheral branches of

the nerves, and traced their distribution in various tissues. These inquiries have

been followed up by the German histologists, and now it is maintained that nerve-
fibres may be traced even into the particles of epithelium. Be this as it may, it is
satisfactory to know that, as the functional influence of the nerves has been found

to govern in a higher degree and more dii-ect manner than formerly suspected the

circulating, secreting, and other nutritive processes, so om- knowledge of the

anatomical domain of the nervous system is being correspondingly extended. As
a marked instance, I may refer to the recent observations on the termination of

nerves in the secreting epithelium of glands. In proceeding to say a word on

other instrumental applications, I may pass over the continued investigations into

the electricity of nerves and muscles, and new determinations, by new methods,

of the velocity of nervous^excitation, as well as new observations with the ophthal-

mometer, ophthalmoscope, laryngoscope, and the newly invented cardiogTaph, and

shall content mj^self with specializing the investigations made in this country

into the phenoruena of the pulse, in health and disease, by means of the spbygmo-

graph, and the important experimental inquiries of Dr. Sanderson on the influence

of the thoracic movements on the circulation of the blood, carried on by means of
the hasmadynamometer and additional ingenious apparatus contrived by himself.
The accoimt of his observations is contained in the Croonian Lecture for 1866,
delivered by him before the Eoyal Societ}', which will shortly be published in the

Philosophical Transactions. An important contribution to the physiology of

respiration was, not long since, derived from a combined chemical and optical

investigation, by Professor Stokes, into the oxidation and deoxidation of the

colom-ing-matter of the blood. Spectnmi analysis promises much aid in physio-

logical inquiry. It has been already employed )jy Dr. Bence Jones and JIi-. Dupre,
in a most remarkable and extensive series of experiments on the time required for

the absorption and elimination of foreign matters by the living tissues. The sub-
stance used was a salt of lithia, and it was traced into and out of the non-vascidar

as well as the vascular tissues. The continued employment of chemical means in

physiological inquiries scarcely requires any comment. I must nevertheless make
an exception in regard to some recent experimental residts which lead to an impor-

tant modification of the views heretofore generally entertained as to the generation

of muscular force. From an experiment, now well known, by Fick and Wislicenus,

in an ascent of the Faulhom, these observers concluded that the mechanical force
and heat developed in muscular exertion cannot be derived solely or principally
from oxidation of the proper muscular tissue. Dr. Fraukland has subjected their
data and conclusions to a careful chemical criticism, in which he determined ex-
perimeutallv the heat,_ and consequently the mechanical force, produced by the
oxidation of albuminoid substances ; and, on comparing this with the results of
the Alpine experiment, he has fuUy confirmed the conclusions drawn from it. It
would therefore seem as if a muscle ordinarily uses other materials, probably
hydrocarbonous, to be oxidated in the production of force, as a steam-engine uses
fuel, and not its own substance. More lately Professor Parkes has made, at the
Netley Hospital, two series of very careful experiments, in which the whole of the

mdischarged nitrogen was exactly determined; and his experiments, which are

related two recent Numbers of the ^Proceedings of the Koyal Society,' lead to
the same general inference as those of the Swiss inquirers ; 'but Dr. Parkes has
further found that nitrogen is retained dm-mg the actual performance of work,
perhaps even taken up in some form by the muscle and assimilated, and that the
discharge of it mainly takes place in the period of rest which succeeds exertion.
Without undidy protracting these rather desultory remarks, I may be permitted
to speak of a new and curious method of researcli quite recently introduced by a
foreign experimenter, which has as yet been especially employed for tracing the
more intimate distribution of the ducts in the liver "and kidney, but is possibly
76 REPOKT--1867.

applicable to tte solution of otlier anatomical and physiological questions. It

consists in injecting- into a vein or introducing into the stomacli of a living animal
a colouring-matter, which may, after a certain lapse of time, be found filling, and
so rendering conspicuous, the gland ducts through which it is being eliminated
from the sj'stem. It is needless to pursue these considerations further, and it is

not my purpose to attempt anything in the nature of a general sm'vey of the recent

work done in our science. The number of active workers has so greatly multiplied,
and the published results of their labours have become so immense in extent and

variety, that, to me at least, it would be a hopeless task to present within reason-

able compass any consistent and intelligible summary. In one of the lately pub-
lished annual reports on the progress of anatomy and physiology, I find that the
wi-iters referred to as ha^dng contributed to these sciences within the year are

between five and six hundred, and a good many of them are cited for two or more
contributions. One fruitful source of this increased production has been the insti-

tution in recent years of physiological laboratories in various continental seats of

learning, in which practical instruction is given in histological and physiological

studies, and where many able and well-trained young men, ambitious of scientific
distinction, are engaged in prosecuting original inquiries. No one, of course, can

doubt the gain to science thus immensely accruing ; at the same time it must be
admitted that the eager publication of iuimatm'e results and hasty conclusions to
which some are tempted, and the corrective, or at least diverging statements of
others, equally confident, which speedily follow, present in not a few cases an

amount of contradiction and confusion most bewildering to any one who desires

to master the existing state of knowledge of the subject. But although this is
undoubtedly a drawback, it is trifling in comparison with the advantage of mani-
fold activity and accelerated progress. Anatomical aud physiological jomuials,
and other channels for the publication of physiological papers, have of late years
been on the increase abroad, and augmented facilities are thus afforded for dis-
seminating new matter ; and we admire (I might almost say envy) the number
and excellence of the graphic illustrations with which they are furnished. Such
advantages are not so freely offered to the anatomists and physiologists of this
country. Anatomical and physiological memoirs, for the most part, require elabo-
rately executed figures for their illustration, and the expense of a journal illus-
trated fully and fitly is found to be a serious obstacle to its maintenance, with tlie
limited circulation which a purely scientific periodical has heretofore obtained in

Britain. It has sometimes occun-ed to me that a publication fund might be esta-

blished, which, under unimpeachable management and control, might be applied
especially to defray part of the expense incurred in illustrating scientific memoirs.
Such a purpose, I venture to think, is not tmworthy of consideration by those who
desire to promote knowledge by pecuniary foundations.

   Finally, let me say a word on the influence of the British Association in the

promotion of our science. The British Association carries on its work in various
ways. One most important line of action is the appointment of committees, or
individual members, to draw up reports on the progress and existing state of par-
ticular branches of science, or to in^·estigate particular scientific questions by
actual observation or experiment, and report thereon; and every year sums of
money are voted to meet the expenses of such investigations. These reports are
published in extemo in the annual volume, and are, for the most part, of gi-eat and
acknowledged value. Biological science has fairly participated in these advan-
tages, and has further profited through the example set by the British Association,
which has led other influential bodies to set on foot investigations by similar
means. Doubtless it might be held that the same or like advantages might be
obtained through a stationary scientific institution, and without such local gather-
ings and annual visitations as that which we are now attending ; but it has been

justly said that the periodic meetings of the British Association in different places
serve not only to freshen the interest and stimidate the activity of the habitual
cultivators of science, but also to render the studj' more widely attractive, aud
enlist fresh energies in the pursuit ; and then it must be remembered that the
subjects for reports and particular lines of inquiry are for the most part suggested
or determined by the discussions that take place at these meetings. It must be
               TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                              77

   confessed, indeed, that the published proceedings (as distinguished from special
   reports) of the Section of Physiology make no great show in the series of volumes
   issued by the Association ; but, without undervaluing the reports of these pro-
   ceedings, I would venture to say that they are not, and cannot well be, a just

   measure of the useful work done. Much of the good eifected by the sectional

   meetings can never be recorded. I remember being present at an assembly of the
   German Association of Naturalists at Berlin in 1828, and of hearing Olten, one
   of the most distinguished members and original founders of that institution,
   declare that the great pm-pose of the Association was, not to listen to long and

   elaborate communications, but rather to bring men of kindred pursuits from dif-

   ferent parts into friendly relation with each other, affording them the opportunity
   of freely exchanging information, exhibiting new and interesting specimens and
   experiments, offering mutual suggestions, and establishing useful correspondence.

   All, I feel sure, will admit that this promotion of friendly intercourse among men

   engaged in the pursuit of science and those interested in its advancement is (and
   let us hope it will long continue to be) one of the great benefits conferred by the

   British Association.

   On the Preservation of Fishing Streams. By Sir Jajtes E. Aiexaxdek.

               Notes on the Sinicture of certain Hydroid Medusce.

                       By Professor Allma:n^, M.D., F.B.S.

                                                                                                                                                           I. Slabbeeia.

   It is well known that in Slahheria there occurs upon each of the fom* radiating

   canals a definite oval enlargement, which so closely resembles, in external appear-

   ance and in fposition, the generative pouches of Ohelia, and of several other

   Hydroid Medusre, that a similar function has been hitherto, without hesitation,

   assigned to it. It has, however, nothing to do yAih generation ; it consists of a

   mere thickening of the walls of the canal, and in no case could any trace of ova or

   spermatozoa be detected in it.

      It is in the walls of the inanubrium that the generative elements are developed,

   and the manubrium becomes enlarged by their presence for a definite extent,

   exactly as in Sarsia. Nothing, however, has been discovered which seems capable

   of throwing further light on the import of the enlargements of the radiating canals.

   It will be thus seen that Slahheria belongs to that group of Hydroid Meduss

   which produces its generative elements in the walls of the manubrium instead of in

   special generative buds developed from the radiating canals. In other words, it
   belongs to the true "gonophore" rather than to that form of Medusa to which

   the author had elsewhere given the name of " blastocheme."

   Forbes, the founder of the genus, misled by the peculiar dilatations of the

   radiating canals, and not recognizing the presence of generative elements in the
   manubrium, regarded Slahheria as a blastocheme; and this view has since been

   accepted, although the presence of distinct ocelli and the absence of lithocysts
   might have raised doubts as to its justice.

      It may be noticed that Agassiz describes dilatations of the radiating canals in a

   North American Pmnaria, and regards them, though -with some hesitation, as
   generative sacs. There can, however, be little doubt that the medusa of Pennaria

   is a true phanerocodonic gonophore, having its generative elements developed in

               H. On some pectdiariiies in the Structure of Obelia.

      The little medusa which forms the subject of the present notice is produced by
   the very common hydroid Ohelia (Laomedea) yetiicidata, from whose gonangia it
   may be seen escaping in shoals _ during the whole of the spring and summer
   months. The marginal tentacles in the recently liberated medusa are twenty-four
   in number. Of these four are radial, being situated in the same meridional planes

   with the radiating canals, and 1)etween every two radial are five interradial ten-

taclea ; they have all a very distinctly chambered axis, composed of a single series
 of cells whose contiguous walls fonn the transverse ^partitions. Each chamber
 contains a clear liomogeneous fluid, with a nucleus which is usually seated on the
centre of the partition wall, and imbedded in a mass of granular protoplasm, which
is frequently continued through the axis of the cell in the form of a filament.

    The chambered axis of the tentacle becomes slightly thicker towards the
proximal end, and is here continued into the substance of the umbrella, through
nearly the entire of whose thiclmess it runs. The terminal cell of the tentficle
root thus plunged into the gelatinous mass of the umbrella is much larger than any
of the others which form the axis of the tentacle. Like the other cells of the
axis, it frequently presents a nucleus on some part of its walls.

    The axis of the tentacle is surrounded by an ectodermal tube, composed appa-
rently of membraneless cells, and having great numbers of minute, curved thread-
cells immersed in it. Near the root of tlie tentacle its ectoderm is thickened into
a cushion-like swelling, which becomes continuous with the umbrella margin.
Between the ectoderm and the chambered core of the tentacle is a well-marked
layer of longitudinal muscular fibres.

   The tentacle is thus absolutely solid in its entire extent, presenting nowhere any
trace of an axile tube. There can be therefore no communication between it and
the circular canal, which accordingly simply passes over the subumbrellar side of

its root.

   The author had been unable to find any trace of a velum which, certainly at the
period of liberation, does not present a visible rudiment, though in certain positions
of the medusa the optical expression of the thickness of the umbrella produces a
deceptive appearance which may be mistaken for a narrow velum.

   It will be thus apparent that there are two points in which Ohelia contrasts most
strongly with the great majority of hydroid Medusre, namely, (1) the structure of
the tentacles, and their entire want of connexion with the gastrovascular system,
and (2) the non-do\"elopmeut of a velum.

   The condition of the tentacles in OhcIia is entirely that of those organs in the
very aben-ant genus Cunina, where they are also inserted into the substance of the
imaljrella by a root chambered like the rest of the tentacle. The tentacles of Ohelia,

too, just like those of Cvnina, are remarkable for their slight extensibility, their

motions consisting chiefly in a spasmodic jerking up and down. The umbrella
possesses but slight contractility, and the progression of the medusa would appear
to be chiefly effected by the iin-like action of the tentacles. The habitually
everted condition of the umbrella, which causes what is its inner surface in other
medus.ie to become here convex, and its outer surface to become concave, would
seem to be connected with the non-development of a velum.

         in. The Stnicture of the Lithocysts in the Medusa o/" Campanulaeia.

   In the medusa of Campmmlaria Johnstoni (a medusa referable to the deep-
belled section of Gegenbaiu-'s genns Uiicopc) the marginal bodies or "lithocysts"
are situated on a chord-like structure which runsroimd the margin of the umbrella,
and which presents a little oval enlargement at each oi tlie points where it sup-
ports a lithocyst. This chord-like portion has been noticed in other medusfe, and
has been regarded as a nerve-chord with ganglionic enlargements ; Ijut it is plainly
nothing more than tlie ectoderm of the lower smface of the marginal canal. The
lithocyst is immersed for a slight depth in the marginal enlargement which sup-
ports it, and which sends a very delicate extension of its substance over the whole
of its free surface ; it consists of a spherical, transparent, and stractureless vesicle,
the greater part of whose cavity is occupied by a soft pulp. In this pulp, which
has necessarily a spherical fonn corresponding to that of'the containing vesicle,
there is excavated at the distal pole, or that which is opposite to the basis of
attachment of the vesicle, a pit-like cavity, and within this cavity, but not entirely
filling it, is the spherical, higlily refracting concretion. In the spherical pulp
itself no trace of structure could be detected, but its sm-face is marked by twelve
or fifteen delicate stria?, which take a meridional course at exactly equal distances
from one another. At the distal polo they all terminate distinctly in the margin

of the pit-like excavation, and may be thence traced to within a short distance of

the opposite pole, the strife generally appearing light-coloured when contrasted
with the darker intervening spaces. On the nature of these strife no further light
could be thrown ; but the atithor had little doubt that they are what Ilensen has
incoiTectly interpreted as " auditory hairs " in a medusa which he refers to the

geniis Ohelia, but which probably belongs to the present type. It will be seen,

too, that the structiu'e of the lithocyst in CcDiqninuhria differs in many respects
from that of the same body in the Geryonidce as described by IIa3ckel, though the
meridional strife with which the surface of the central pulp is marked in Cam-
pamdnria may suggest a comparison with the two supposed " senae-nerves " which
HfBckel has observed rimning in two opposite meridians on the inner side of the

wall of the capsule in Carmarina and Glossocodon.

                  Notice of some rare Plants recentli/ collected in Scotland.

                     By Professor Baltoue, M.'D., M.A., F.M.S.

   In this communication Professor Balfour alluded to the localities for rare plants
in Scotland, and referred to the statements made as to the supposed disappearance

of plants from the zeal of botanical collectors. He stated that a prize had been

offered by the Maharajah of Jeypore to the Botanical Class of the University of

Edinburgh for the best collection of Scotch plants, and that the announcement of

this had called forth a severe remonstrance fi-om a London correspondent, who

warns the University against allowing such a prize to be given on account of the

risk of extirpating rare plants. Professor Balfour showed that such fears were
groundless, and that the localities of rare plants had suffered, not so much from

botanists as from nurserymen and others who collected for the purpose of sale, as

well as from the improved cultivation of the country, drainage, and other agricul-

tural improvements. One rare plant, Phyllodoce ccendea, had been nearly destroyed

by the rapacity of a Scotch nurserj'man ; but Professor Balfour was happy to say

the plant still existed on the Sow of Athole, and he showed a specimen which had

been collected in August last. Drainage was affecting seriously the localities in
which Corallorrhiza innata was known to grow, but several new stations had been
found in Scotland. Pinf/iucula alpina was becoming very scarce, owing to the
drainage of the Black Isle. The greatest injury had been caused in the case of

fems, which were now cultivated for sale to a very large extent; and Professor
Balfour Imew of instances where English collectors had robbed stations for

Woodsia hyperhorea and ilvenm, Cystopteris montana, Asplenimn septentrionale,

A. germanicum, and others. In these cases money-maldng was the object. He
was glad to saj^, however, that new localities were constantly being discovered,
and that botanists were now becoming cautious in their communication to ruthless
vendors of plants. New localities had been found for Goodyera repens near Edin-

burgh and near Melrose. Corallorrhiza innata had been found in several places in
Fife and Perthshire.

   Professor Balfour then noticed an addition to the flora of Scotland in the case of

Apera interrvpta, which occuixed in large quantity on Dirleton Common, about
twenty miles east from Edinburgh. He then gave an account of a trip to Dal-
whinnie in August last, duiiug which he and his party had visited the Sow of
Athole, the Boar of Badenoch, Loch Ericht and Loch "Laggan, Ben Aulder, and
Corryarder. He described the occurrence of snow in large quantity on the hills,

and mentioned that he observed Polypodium alpestre and P.Jlexilc in abundance.

He had gathered in Glen Tilt Bicramnn Grevillianmn and several other rare mosses
which had been recently discovered by Miss Mclnroy of Lude. He had visited the

station of Polypodium calcareum, near Aberfeldy, and observed the fern growing

plentifully in an old limestone-quarry. He noticed also the occurrence oi Aster

.yaliffnus in considerable qu",ntity in several stations on the banks of the Tay, par-

ticularly near Dalguise and Sgggieden. In the latter place it had been seen for many
years hj Colonel Drummond-Hay.

liad not been taken up by the Association. He wished now to claim for arbori-

cultm'e sucli a position in science as its importance deserved. He showed that trees

occupied in Britain one twenty-second part of the whole area, or only one-third less

than what is under gi'een crops. To everj- eleven acres of cultivated land there is one

of wood, and one to every sixteen of uncultivated. The gross yearly value of this

wood-crop was stated to be no less than £2,500,000. The eftects of trees on the

climate were then explained, injudicious clearings or overplanting respectively

causing aridity and himiidity. The want of a due proportion of a countrj' imder a

tree-crop is certain to cause irregularity of temperature, violent storms, and dry-

ness                    while it  may be,  on  the  other hand, over-clothed, so                                                              as to bring about just

the opposite effects. As illustrative of the effects of trees on the health of the

population, reference was made to the districts of Grantown and Ahernethy, in

btrathspay, which until of late were covered with close masses of plantation and

natural forests ; but a regular system of thinnings and clearings having been carried
out, the result has been a gi-eat and gradual decrease of deaths, in consequence, as

he fully substantiated by statistics, mainly to the wood-sm-face having been brought

down to a more healthy proportion.

                        0)1 Bfitisli Fossil Cycadece. By W. Carrtjthers, F.L.S., F.O.S.

   After describing the structure and peculiarities of living Cycads, the author gave

a history of our knowledge of the known British fossil species. Two genera had

been described, Clathraria and C'l/cadnidea, Clathrai-ia had a simple or bifurcated

stem, with the internal structm-e of Cijcas. The scars on the stem are alternately

large and small as in the recent genus, and some fruits found in the same beds

with them agree generally with those of Ci/ca.'i. Four species have been found,

Clathraria Lycllii (Mant.), C. Mantelli (Carr.), C. Bucldandii (Can-.), and C. Milkri

A(Carr.)                new genus, Yatesia, was established for a fossil Avith a simple stem with

Auniform scars and liaving fruits in terminal cones.                                                                                          single species was known of

this genus in Britain, I'. Morisii (Carr. ). Buckland's genus Ctjcadoidea had bulbiform

trunks with small branches permanently attached to the stem. Three species have

been described, C. mer/alophi/lla {Hiickl.), C. microphi/lla (Huckl.), and C. pyf/mcea

A(Lindl. andHutt.).                        fourth genus, named Benndtitcs, in aclniowledgment of the

great assistance given to the author by J. J. Bennett, Esq., of the British Museum,

was established for three remarkable forms, distinguished from all other Cycads in

having an oval stem and a single woody cylinder from which the vascular tissue

for each leaf separated in a single bundle. The fruit of the genus was described.

This consisted of seeds borne on the ends of branched pedicels, which were deve-

loped from the apex of short branches in the axils of the leaves. Three species

were described, Bennettites ScLibi/i (Carr.), B. Gihsoni (Carr.), and.B. Peachii (Carr.).

rately, one entozoon only had been described as infesting the red-legged partridge                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I

grouse, three in the black grouse, four in the pheasant, and, lastly, foiu-teen in the

fowl. It would seejn tliat the prevalence or absence of Entozoa in the grouse had

no connexion with the so-called " grouse-disease;" that was an inflammatory dis-

order of the blood terminating in gangTene and pj-pemia. The tapeworm of the

grouse had              been      regarded as  a distinct species                                                                             but the author had no doubt that

selves so long out of the -water, aucl propelled themselves throuyli the air. The
results satisfactorily show that the ilyiugiish never leaves the water except pressed
by its aquatic enemies; aud with regard to the second point, although their
passage from the water to the air is always accompanied by a rapid vibration of

the pectoral fins, such a vibration does not continue, nor does it recur unless the
fish passes througli a wave-crest, or iu_^sorae manner wets its fins afresh. In this

case a new vibration occurs, and it seems the stimulus of the sea-water produces
the vibration in question. But the fish may progress with great rapidity for 70

or 80 yards, without any fresh vibration, although it never rises more than a foot or

eighteen inches above the surface of tlie waves.

   The various species of Lucernariadie and PliysophoridiB formed the subject of this
communication. The author referred to the circumstances under which they occa-

the same species, at the same time. Tlie shoals embraced, on different occasions,

Aiirelia, lihizostoma, PcUu/ia, Stcphanomia, PJit/salia, Vdclta, andPorpita. He espe-

ciallj' described the magnificent species of Plujsalia, seen in some abundance near
the Equator in the Atlantic Ocean, wliicli were each accompanied by a number of
small fishes, which harboured uuler the shelter of the long tentacles and polypites

of the P/ii/salia.

   The author stated that he had found many new species of Xudibrauchiata, Pla-

nariau Annelids, Crustacea, Echinoderms, &c. upon the shores of China, Formosa,

Borneo, and Singapore Straits, of which he exliibited specimens. He described

the habits of some remarkable crustaceans which iuhaljit the sandy shores of
these countries, and exhibited some new species of snapping shrimps (Aljjhens)

from Cliiua and Singapore. He announced also tlie discovery of some enormous

Actiniffi inliabiting tlie coral-reefs of the China seas, in which a number of fishes
lived semiparasitically. lie had met with these Actinire on tlie submerged reefs
of the Cliina seas, aud also upon tlie coast of Borneo, and had himself extracted a
living fish from one of tlieni. The paper Avas illustrated by a large series of
coloured drawings, made by the author, from life, the greater part of them being
of new species, to be afterwards described.

   The curious little Alga remarked by former observers as discolouring the sea in
some parts of the world was observed by the author in greatest profusion in the
China sea, where it formed a thick scum of many miles in extent. It )iever pre-
sented the blood-red appearance of the two species of Trichodcsmium described
by Montague and others, but was always of a uniform pale straw-colour. The
JVutlior believed that it was a different species from T. Ehri'iihorgii ov T. Iliiidsii;
and stated that it was confervoid in character, exhibited no spontaneous movenicuts,
but was, in some parts of the Indian Ocean, associated with an Oscillatoria, which
he also described Avith figures.

 On the Moi-pliology of the Arthrojwda. By Anton Dohrn, Dr. Phil. Jena.

   The author had studied the development of Pulcemon, Lithodes, Poi-tuntis, and

more especially Mysis and Cu7na. He considers the complex respiratory apparatus
of Cumn as a high degree of elahoration of the simple form met with in Zoea. The
mieropyle apparatus in the hack oiCuma and the Edriophthalma is nothing but the

remains of the dorsal spine of Zoea, or rather of the larval form of the cirripeds,
which he calls Archkoea, as he believes Zoea takes its origin from it. The larval

membrane of Cuma axiA Edriophthalma is nothing but the last remains of the carapace
of the Nauplius of the cirripeds. The trefoil-like appendages oiAzellus are the last

remains of the Zoea state, representing the carapace, the spines on the sides of the

carapace, and the respiratory apparatus of the Zoea. The two pairs of antenna}

and the mandibles of the Crustacea are homologous with the three pairs of extre-
mities of Nauplius. The plate and appendage which reach the top of the head in

the Cuma embryo develope into the carapace and branchial apparatus. The plate
in Cuma and Phryganea are identical. In Cuma it becomes the carapace, in Phry-
(janea the head-plate ; whilst the appendage which in Cuma forms the top of the

branchial apparatus, forms in Phryyanea the antennte.

Amblystegium confervoides, a Moss new to Britain. By John Feaser, M.D.

   While visiting Dovedale, on the 29th of November 18G6, for the purpose of exa-
mining its mosses, the author was fortunate enough to find a small and in some re-

spects an insignificant moss, but which has never before been observed in the

British Isles. It has been submitted both to Mr. Wilson of Warrington and Pro-

fessor Schimper of Strasbm-g, who are quite agreed as to what the moss is, and who

are satisfied that this is the first time it has been recorded in this country. It has

previously been found on the Alps and other parts of Europe.

The romantic dale of the Dove is on the confines of Derbyshire and Staffordshire

it consists of the Mountain Limestone, which rises on either side to a considerable
elevation. The new moss was picked up in that portion of it which belongs to

Staffordshire, growing in patches more or less extensive, not on the bark of trees,

nor on the solid rock, but on detached stones of small size in shady places.^ It has

not been found except in one place, and that over a small area and in small

quantity. It is to be hoped that it may be found in other parts of the limestone

in that "district, as well as in other parts of England.

   The moss itself is one of the smallest species. It has much affinity to Hypmim

incurvafum, differing chiefly in its smaller size, hair-like depressed branches, and in

the lax texture of the leaves, which are quite destitute of nerve. At first it was

supposed to be Amhhjdcyium subtile ; but this has a straight erect capsule, no cilia

to the inner ]5eristonie, and leaves faintly ner\ed.

                      On the Destruction of Plantations at Drumlanriy by a species of Vole.

                                                     By Dr. Gkieeson.

The ravages of one or more species oiArvicola or Vole in the plantations at Drum-

lanrig in Dumfriesshire have been for years increasing. As far as the author can

learu, such was not specially noticed until about the year 1852. Since then the de-

struction might be represented by high figures. It woidd seem that the Voles liave

migratory habits, at times appearing in vast numbers in plantations where they had

not beenpreviously noticed, and which they almost completely destroy. The destruc-

Aticn is principally among the young oaks and ash.                                                                      ring of bark is gnawed from

the tree close to the root, wliere it is covered with grass. The efloct of this ring of

bark being removed is tbe destruction of the tree. Plantations are liable to be so
injured until they are of more than twelve years' gi-owtli. Should there be auy trees
of holly their bark is almost wholly removed. It is in the winter months that the
destruction chiefly takes place, especially when the ground is covered with snow.
In the examinatiou of hundi'eds of voles obtained from the Urumlanrig plantations
the author distinguished two species : the one corresponds to the ArvicoJa pnitends,
the other to the A. cujrestis. The former bears but a small proportion in number to
the latter. There can be little or no doubt that the enormous increase of voles is
owing to the relentless extirpation of rapacious birds, and especially of the
weasles. While natm'e gave unlimited fertility to the Eodentia, she boimded their
destructive increase by the caruivora ; and it is not wise for man, for the sake of
sport, to distm-b that order. Nature will not suffer him with impunity ; the
forests will become blighted, and the laud overrun with vermin, unless he ceases to

destroy indiscriminately the hawks, the owls, and the weasles.

      On certain Simulations of Vegetable Growths by Mineral Substances.
                             By John Deakin Heaton, M.D.

   Several observers have noticed the curious arborizations which are developed
upon crj'stals of various salts when immersed in a solution of silicate of soda,
varyiugin form and other characters. Sulphate of iron seems to be the salt whose
crystals, when so immersed, produce the most free and beautiful forms ; and the
observations noticed had been made with this salt. If small fraoments of these
crystals be dropped into a solution of silicate of soda, formed by diluting the
commercial solution with about tAvice its measure of water, and having a density

of about 1-065, very beautiful arborizations will soon begin to shoot perpendicidarly
upwards, attaining the height of 3 or 4 inches in a few hours, consisting of trunks
subdividing and ramifying into branches of the greatest delicacy, and exactly re-
sembling a miniature forest of leafless trees, or imitating a mass of confervse, the

mode of ramification and the rapidity of growth varying with the density of the
solution used. If a much weaker solution be used, formed by diluting that of the
strength previously employed with two or three times its own measure of water,
and the crystal be suspended by a thread just below the surface, instead of being
allowed to drop to the bottom, roots will shoot downwards to the bottom of the glass
jar containing the solution, but there will be no growth upwards. By using a
solution of an intermediate strength the author had sometimes obtained contorted
fibres, like roots, growing downv/ards, and stems growing perpendicularly upwards
on the same crystal, suspended in the middle of the solution. The branches which
grow upwards, like the ascending stem of a plant, do not owe their tendency to ascend
to their having a lower specific gravity than the liquid in which they are formed
on the contrary, when broken from their support, they at once sink to the bottom
of the liquid. The same is true with respect to the downw^ard roots, which sink
to the bottom when detached from the crystal on which they form. They are very
friable, but have sufficient strength to retain their form for some days if not dis-
tiu-bed ; but when lifted out of the liquid, thej' collapse and fall to pieces. Both
silex and the salt of iron enter into their composition, as is evidenced by their
colour, which is various tints of olive or bluish green, and their- brittle insoluble
character. The weaker the solution the more silex and the less iron enters into

their composition, the branches being of a paler colour, or almost white, according

to the strength of the solution. Examined microscopically, the ultimate ramifica-

 tions are foimd to be cylindrical, but gradually tapering to fine needle-like extre-

 mities, and tubular throughout ; the walls being formed of a delicate inciustation,
have no appearance of crystallization, but are finely granular. They subdivide like
the branches of a tree ; sometimes they are irregularly contorted ; sometimes two

 adjacent parallel branches unite, and again separate just as we see in the threads

 of microscopic conferv£S, the tubular formation, however, being continuous through-

 out. The tubular character is equally apparent in the roots ; but their terminations
 are more abrupt, sometimes club-shaped.

    These phenomena present strong resemblances to the modes and forms of
 growth of bodies belonging to the vegetable kingdom of organic nature. The

                                                                                                         6*

ascending and descending growtlis of the stem and root of a plant are exaetly

iinitatod\y these formations, inllueuced by some force which is neither that of

gravitatioii nor the molecular attraction of crj'stallization. The growth of these

formations is likewise interstitial, like that of au organized  living tissue                                                          otherwise

how can the conical tubular extremities be carried forwards as the branches elon-

gate ? or how can these tubular branches unite and again separate, the continuity

of the tubes remaining unbroken ? These curious formations present another ex-
ample of tlie approximation of dead matter to living organizations in the modes in
which they increase, and in the forms which they assume ; and they seem to increase
the difficulty of defining even between the primary division of organized living
beings and inorganic substances. If these forms, or an exact photographic tran-
script of them, were ottered to au observer previously uninformed of their true
nature and origin, they woidd in all probability be pronounced to be vegetable. Or
supposing such purely' mineral substances to have been formed in bygone geological
eras, and to ha\e been accidentally fossilized in some primary or other ancient rock,

they would very probably, when discovered by recent in\-estigation, be pronounced

to be an evidence of organized beings having existed contemporaneously with the

formation of such rock.

On tlie occnn-ence of Aster salignus ( Willd.) in Wiclcen Fen, Cumhridgeshire.
                                By W. P. HiERxV, M.A.

    The above plant was found on the Soth of August 18G7, growing in company witli

Cladiiim Mariscus, Thalidriim flavum, Pt-ucedanum jxdi'sfre, Carduus prafcttsig,

Af/rostis caiiiiui, Lastrea Thchjpteris, and several salices. On the same fen, about two

months previously, the author also found the very rare orchid Sturniiti Lcvsclii (II. ).

    The soil of Wicken Fen consists of a thickness of eight feet or more of peat over-

lying a basin of gault. The peat arises from the decay of ^·arious aquatic plants,

and carbonate of lime is stored in the ditches by the Charas that grow in tlieni.

Attention was drawn to the habit of the specimens which accompanied this paper,

for they have the appearance of wild plants. The spot where the Aster grows is in
Athe midst of sedge, and no house is near it.

  On the Boring of Limestones hj certain Annelids. By E, Eay Laneestee.

   The author drew attention to the boring of Suhella cakarca (already noticed by
Spence Bate and by De Quatrefages), and also to the more interesting case of
Lmcodore, which was new. Leircodore is very abundant on some shores, where
boulders and pebbles may be found worm-eaten and riddled by these worms. Only
stones composed of carbonate of lime are bored by them. On coasts where such
stones are rare thev are selected, and all others are left. The worms are quite soft,
and armed only with horny bristles. IIow, then, do they bore ? The author main-

tained that it "was by the carbonic acid and other acid excretions of their bodies,
aided by the mechanical action of their bristles. The selection of a material soluble
in these acids is most noticeable, since the softest chalk and the liardcst limestone

are bored witli the same facility. Tliis can only be by chemical action. If, then,

we have a case of chemical boring in these worms, is it not probable that many
mollusks are similarly assisted in their excavations ? The author did nut deny the
mechanical action in the F/wlas and other shells, but maintained that in many cases
the cooperation of acid excreta was probable. The truthwas to be found in a

theory which combined the chemical and the mechanical view.

             On the 'Anatomy of tJie Limpet. By E. Eay Lankestee.

   The author drew attention to several points in the anatomy of this interesting
mollusk which had escaped previous obseners, and wliich he had ascertained.
Prof. RoUeston, of Oxford, had assisted the author in contirming his results and
otferinc suggestions. The points noted were : 1st. The existence of a large yellow
salivary gland with four ducts. 2nd. The absence of an oviduct. 3rd. The pre-
sence of two capito-pedal orifices, perhaps the exits of the ova and seed. 4th. The
structure of the large renal sac, which has two external apertures on either side of
the anus, and a minute orifice communicating with the pericardium. The water ex-
uded by the limpet when surprised on its rock probably is squeezed from this organ.

                      On ilie Conserviiiion of Forests in our Colonies.

                 By W. Lauder Lindsay, M.D., F.li.S.E., F.L.S.

   The main object of this paper is to urge the establishment of Boards of Commis-

--sioners or Inspectors of Woods and Forests in all the British colonies which are,

or admit of being, more or less forest-clad in_ order to the
   (1) Preservation and improvement of the primitive forests; and

   (2) The systematic rearing of new forests by way of substitution or replacement as

           and before the old ones disappear.
   The author enters fully on the grounds which lead to the conclusion that a
necessity exists for the establishment of such Boards, and that properly cultivated
forests a're of primary importance to the progress of all countries, young or old. The

autlior's attention was strongly drawn to the subject while travelling in New Zea-

land in 1801. The observations he records were principally made in that colony ;

but subsequent or prior investigation in Australia and various countries or islands
of F.urope, in C( nnexion with a .study of the literature of the subject, lead him to
believe that his suggestions will be' found to apply mvfatis mutandis to all our

forest-clad colonies in at least the earlier stages of their settlement.

86 REPORT--1867.

The main propositions of the author as rep:ards New-Zoalaud forests were the

following:

1. Its present forest area is extremely small in relation to what it evidently was

Ain times comparatively recent.       variety of e'^'idence points to the conclusion that

nearly the whole country was at one period luxuriantly forest-clad, the exceptions

being the snow-covered barren alps of the interior.
   2. The remnants of the primitive forest still existing are rapidly disappearing

under the following combinations of destructive agencies :

I. Natural.

          A. Current geological changes.

             1. Alterations in relative levels of land and water-- especially

            a. Local subsidence of former.
            h. Encroachment by sea sand on the coasts.

                 c. Erosion of coasts b}' the sea, and of the margins of lakes and banks of
                        rivers and streams, especially during the storms and floods of winter.

          --B. Current meteorological or climatological changes avalanches, glaciers,

                 wind-storms, lightning, winter ton-ents and floods (direct agency).

          --C. Current zoological agencies wild animals {c. y. birds and insects) eating

                 bark, tearing up saplings, devouring seeds or seedhngs, burrowing under

            the bark or within the timber.

II. Artificial.

          A. Indirect or accidental.

                 (1 ) Cattle and wild pigs.
                (2) Bush fires.

          B. Direct or deliberate.

            (1) Bush-clearing for agricultural purposes.

            (2) Timber-cutting for [a) building, (y) fencing, (c) fuel.

            (3) Track-making for men or cattle.

3. This destruction, which is more or less necessary or inevitable, is materially

--hastened by the reckless and improvident, or illegal and culpable, timber-felling both

by colonists and natives, more especially as regards the former by

            (1) The abuse of the wood-cutting license ; and as regards the latter by

               (2) Deliberate destruction in connexion with their superstitions.

4. With this improvident and mmecessaiy destruction there coexists a great

scarcity of timber, both for fuel and building, in many parts of the colony, rendering

expensive imports indispensable.

5. No adequate legal check or provision exists for the prevention of abuses and

the protection of the forest interests. On the other hand,

    <;·.  There exists apparently,  on the part both  of Colonial Governments and colo-
_

nists, a blind indiffc'rence to, or ignorance of, the importance of

          (1) Preserving to the utmost in a healthy state of growth the old or virgin

            forests.

          (2) Forestalling their inevitable disappearance, or replacing them, by the sys-
                   tematic cultivation of new forests, whether of

                        A. Indigenous, or

                   ]j. Exotic (acclimatized) trees.

    (3) Forest cultivation in relation to climate.

7. Many important problems await solution, attecting both
   (1) The economic value and applications of the existing indigenous timbers,

           and

   (2) The rearing of new forests,

              which scientific experts, or systematic experiment, are alone probably

                 capable of solving, e. _r/. :

   (1) A. The best season for felling native timbers in different localities.
                 B. The comparative durability in salt and fresh waters.
                  C. Their power of resistance to marine boring animals.

   (2) The determination of tlic species, indigenous or exotic, most suitable for the

            various purposes of building-timber, shelter, fuel,&e., as respects
                   A. ITapidity of gro-'-.th.

                    B. Facility of acclimatization.

             C. Ultimate or permanent economical qualities.
                                                                --

  When8. the virgin forest is destroyed by natural or artificial agencies, the valu-

able timber-yielding trees are not replaced by a young and vigorous growth of the
same species, but generally by a different and inferior growth, sometimes wholly

fruticose, occasionally only cryptogamic.

   9. Future and permanent timber-supplies must be looked for from forests yet to
be ai-tificially reared and systematically cultivated, consisting in great measure of in-
troduced or acclimatized (exotic) trees of a hardier growth than those which are

indigenous.

  10. There is an e\ddent and pressing want of a Board of Forests in New Zealand,

with a complete skilled staff suitable to the requirements of so large and so varied
a colony ; while a similar want exists in aU our colonies which are similarly placed.

   The author dwelt chiefly on the abuse of the bush license, on sacrifices to a blind
find ignorant utilitarianism that are only too common, on indiscriminate and extra-

vagant destruction of valuable timber arising from a loose colonial moralitj^, or a
tolerated evasion of the written law, and on those other errors of commission or
omission on the part of governments or settlers which illustrate the necessity for
the establishment of some authoritative form of supervision and protection over

the forest interests.

  He instituted comparisons between the condition of New Zealand forests and

the history of forest destruction and cultivation in Scotland, the Hartz Mountains,

and India,' pointing out the fruits of lavish waste and ignorant indifference, and
indicating the present forest regulations of the Hartz district in Germany * as models
for imitation in all our colonies. The paper concludes by showing the fertile and

important results likely to accrue from acclimatization-experiments in relation to

Newforest-culture in  Zealand, especially fi-om the introduction on the large scale

of certain of the hardier, rapidly growing trees of Tasmania and Australia.

Is Lichen-growth detrimental to Forest and Fruit Trees f?

     By W. Lauder Lindsay, M.D., F.R.S.E., F.L.S.

The author's object was on the one hand to direct attention to the radical differ-

ences of opinion that exist regarding the eftect of Lichen-growth on trees, and on

the other to endeavour to reconcile those differences, and to indicate the inferences
that are legitimately deducible from existing data. The paper, however, was in-

tended to be suggestive rather than descriptive ; its aim was rather to call attention
to the unsatisfactory paucity and character of the facts on record, and to invite the

record oi facts as contradistinguished from mere opinions, than to elaborate his own

views or results.

   One gToup of scientific authorities regards Lichens as trtte jmrasites, and as such

detrimental to the healthy growth  of trees, and  depreciative  of their value                                                       while
                                                                                                                                  ;

another group describes them as non-parasitic, as making use of trees simply as bases

--of sup2)ort as innocuous, or even as beneficial, to their hosts. The former opinion is
--that unanimously held by arboriculturists and nurserymen by all who are concerned

with the cultivation of timber, bark, or fruit-trees ; while the latter is that usually

entertained by lichenologists.

The principal propositions of the author were the following :

   I. That Lichens must be regarded as tnce imrasites, drawing certain at least of
          the constituents of theirthallus from the objects on which they grow.

   In his work on ' British Lichens," published iir 1856 (p. 50), the author had
shown that the Lichen-thallus contains such bases as silica and alumina, iron and

manganese, lime, potash, soda, and magnesia, which could not have been derived
from the atmosphere, from which liclienologists assert Lichens derive their whole

nourishment.

11. That nurserymen discard as unsaleable trees or shrubs that are Lichen-

covered.

   * The author gave some description of these regulations after a tour through the Hartz
Forest in 1850 : vide Proceedings of Botanical Society of Edinburgh for 1853, and Phyto-

logist, vol. iv. p. 988 (1853).

   t The subject may be found treated at greater length in ' Hardwicke's Science Gossip,'

1867, p. 241 ; or the ' Farmer,' Oct, 9, 1867, p. 403,

88 HE PORT--1867.

   III. That foresters and tanners regard Liclien-coated oak-bark as of diminished
            value l)y virtue of such coatinp:.

   IV. That arboricultimsts consider Lichen-growth, a disease, or as a cause or rcs^tlt

             of disease.

soil and manure are suitable. Further, the disease of Lichen-growth, when it ap-
pears, can be removed or dissi])ated at will by placing the tree which it affects in
more favourable conditions of development, such as transfer to a richer soil or the

supply of proper manure.

On Plant-Acclimatization in Scotland, ivith special reference to Tussac Grass*.
                  Bij W. Laudee Lindsay, M.D., F.R.S.E., F.L.S.

    In ]\Iay 18GG the author inspected the condition of the Tussac-grass plantations
that had been established in 1845 by J.imes Eitchie, C.E., of Perth, ou the estates

of Sir Jiinics Mathcson in the Lews (Outer Hebrides). The main objects of his
communication were on the one hand to describe the condition of limited planta-
tions of a most nutritious and valuable exotic grass, which is capable of luxuriant
growth on otherwise sterile shores in Scotland, and on the other to illustriate

certain points in connexion with plant-acclimatization in Scotland that have not
attracted that degTee of attention which they deserve, viz. :

   I. The necessity, as regards success, in acclimatization-experiments for imitatiiir/
           tlie natural conditimis of f/rvicth ; and

   II. The inevitable failure that must residt from ignorance of or inattention to these

             conditions.

   From all the evidence he had collected, the author's conclusion was that the
Tussac experiment in the Lews was on the whole a fiiilurc, but one due solely to

inattention to the proper care and cultivation of the grass. Tussac roqiures protec-
tion and care like other crops, and not more so. Sxutable regulations for both pro-

tection and care were laid down by Mr. liitchie ; and so long as these were carried

out or attended to, the plantations thrived, and they only failed after he left the

island, and the conduct of the experiment was consigned to those who had a less
intelligent conception of its importance, and an infeiior interest in its success. The

immediate causes of the destruction of the crops of Tussac, wliich were flourishing
in 1852, appear to have been (1 ) non-protection by fences, and ( 2) the Avaut of weed-
ing. Cattle were allowed unlimited access, with the result that the plant was de-
stroyed, partly by being trampled down, partly by the roots being grubbed up and
eaten. Weeding was not attended to, and in general terms no care was bestowed
on its cidtivation.

   The author believes there is no ground for doubting that tcith the same amount of
care as is bestowed on other crops, such as turnips, Tussac grass may be successfully
cultivated on many of the bleak and sterile islands and coastsof Scotland, to which
it could not fail to become a boon of no iusiKnificant kind.

                      To wJiat extent is Liclien-qrowth a test of Aeje?

                 By AV. Latjdek Lindsay, M.D., F.ll.S.E., F.L.S.

   The opinion is, and has been long prevalent among poets, historians, and archajo-
logists, that trees and buildings are aged in proportion to the copiousness of their
Lichen-covering ; that Lichen-growth may be regarded as a test of the antiqiuty of

the natural objects or artificial structures on -N^'hich it occurs. Poets constantly
speak of trees, rock.s, or towers as being " mossed -Kith ae/c ;' while archreologists
have gone so far as to consider Lichen-growth diaf/nustic of antiquitv. The popular

name of Lichens, " Time-stains," shows that .such a belief is, however, by no means

confined to tlie classes of writers referred to. Eotanical writers have fostered this
belief by almost uniformly describing Lichens as of very slow growth, attaining to

great age. The object of the author's paper was to exliibit the result of certaiu

researches on the subject of Lichen-growth in rekition to the age of the structures

on which it occurs, in order to determine how far the current opinions in question

are founded on fact. His immediate object was to determine the rapidity of Lichen-
Howdevelopment under favourable conditions, or, in other words,
                                                                 soon" mioht a

fresh surface of wood or stone become so Lichen-clad as to assume tlie " lioarj' " or

"time-stained" appearance that is popularly associated with the idea ofgi-eat a"e?

In endeavouring to solve this question he assumed, as standards of comparison, the

megaliths of Stennis in Orkney and Callernish in Lewis, botli of which groups of

prehistoric remains, undoubtedly of great though imdetermined age, he had visited

in May 1866, and of whose Lichen-Flora he had published an account in tlae

Transactions of the Botanical Societj' of Edinburgh (vol. ix. p. 154). On the other

hand, he noted the development of Lichen-gi-owth on a variety of recent structures

of known age, including

I. Walls of buildings, gardens, and roads : bridges and other edifices of stone : as
       well as the mortar or cement used in their construction and in their repair

from time to time.

II. Fences of sawn timber around fields and gardens : posts, gates, and other struc-

tures of fabricated wood.

III. Young trees and shrubs in nurseries, plantations, forests, gardens, shrubberies,

and cemeteries.

   The conclusion at which heariives is that within a quarter of a century, in periods
ranging from two to five years and upwards, as copious a clothing of Lichens as
that which covers the monoliths of Stennis or Callernish may be produced in favour-

able conditions of growth, and hence that Lichen-growth furnishes no criterion of

the antiquiti/ of prehistoric or other structures.

   Additional corroborative evidence was adduced from the history of those Lichens
which were or are still collected in Northern Europe, on account of their economi-

cal applications, as food, fodder, or dye-stvifis,e.g.Zecanora tartarea, Cctraria Islait-

dica, and Cladonia rauf/iferina. Their collectors were familiar with the fact that

they may look for replacement of the species they remove in a limited number of

years, varying generally witliin a period of from three to fi^e.

The author draws a distinction between rapidity of primary development and

--slowness of subsequent growth, showing that tlie two phenomena may occur conse-

cutively in the same individual a circumstance which serves to reconcile on the

one hand the facts observed as to the rapidity with which a fresh surfoce, whether

of earth, stone, or wood, may become Lichen-coated ; and on the other the current
opinion among botanists that Lichen-growth is essentially slow, and its duration

practically unlimited.

   Ten years ago, while engaged in researches on the secondary or complementarv

--reproductive organs of Lichens, tlie author met witli a number of instances of

polymorphism or plurality thereof especially of the occurrence in the same species
of more than one form of spermogonium or pycnidium ; and since that date further
instances have frequently occurred to him. The forms of polymorphism specially
described or referred to in the present communication are the occurrence in the

Pannelia, Boccella, and Alectoria.
   The following short catalogue of species, in which the author met with devia-

tions from, modifications of, or additions to, the ordinary reproductive organs or

tion in which future observation is likely to prove useful, either by correcting the
errors of previous authors, or by confirming and extending their results :

   The paper also notices certain resemblances in form between stylospores and
sporidia, and points out that pycnidia are much more prevalent amor^g Lichens than

is at present supposed. The author describes at length the anatomical or structural
distinctions between spermogonia and pycnidia : and makes certain observations on

their presumed respective functions, and in general on the physiology of the secon-

dary reproductive organs and corpuscles of Lichens. It woidd appear, from the

author's researches, that links connecting the Lichens with the Fungi more and

more closely are constantly being discovered ; and that in particular the same
plurality of reproductive organs which characterizes the latter will be found

probably to a less extent to cliaracterize the former*.

The Abnormal forms of Ferns. Bij E. J. Lowe, F.R.S., F.L.S., F.G.S.

The following facts have come under the aiithor's notice during the series of inves-

tigations on this interesting subject.

   1st. As regards the various aljnormal forms that species will assume. It is a

singular fact that most of our British ferns put on ajjpearances closely in imitation
of each other, that the varieties of each species have nianv characters in common,
and that a certain law of form of variety seems- to extend more or less through
both British and exotic species. The more usual forms running through nearly

all our British ferns are those having the fronds crested, crisp, imbricated, confluent,

corymbiferoHs, muUifld, acuminate, narrow, plumose, interrupted, depauperate, ramose,

lind dwarf ; and not only this, but we have the multiple of these, or the combining

together of two or three characters in one frond, such as the 7iarrotc-crispcd, the

mtdti/ld-crisped, or the ?iarrow-muUi/id, as examples.

   Most of these abnormal varieties have been been found wild, and a large propor-
tion in localities where the species is neither abundant nor luxuriant in growth.
Of course, springing from an individual plant, it occupies time and care in raising
duplicates from spores ; and in doing lliis, singular accidental sports have been
raised and a new method of obtnining varieties detected.

   2nd. As regards the gathering and sowing the spores of these sports. It seems

from these experiments almost an established fact that spores gathered from one

portion of an abnormal frond will produce different varieties fior.i those of spores
gathered from another portion of the same frond; that if an accidental abnormal

frond, or jDortion of a frond be fertile, it is not impossible to reproduce from its

spores plants having fronds in imitation of the accidental abnormal form.

If hj cultural means we can induce the growth of singular fronds, we are very

likely to perpetuate the variation of form from the spores. B3' removing the

drainage from the roots of plants that had completed their autumnal growth and

inducing an unnatural and sickly condition for several months, and only repotting

and giving a generous treatment when the fronds were almost ready to unfold, this

caused them to produce abnormal fronds in both the British and exotic species.

3rd. Our knowledge of the reproductive organs of ferns is obscure, and it has

been said that the iein As})lenium micrudun is a hj'brid between ^i«/j/e«»n« marinum

and Asplenium lanceolatum, that Lastrea remota is a hybrid between Lastrea spinu-

losa and Lastrea flli.r-mas, and perhaps that Asplenium f/ermanicum is a hvbrid

Nowbetween Asplenium septentrionale and Asplenium ruta-miiraria.          it doe's not

appear tliat these ferns have e^ser been reproduced from their spores ; and therefore

( if we may accept these a? hybrids) that hybrids of species are unproductive, ^vhereas

the varieties raised from a species can readily be reproduced by spores.

  On some Points in the Anatomif of the Thysanura.
By Sir J. Lubbock, Bart., F.B.S., Pres. Ent. Soc. ^r.

   The author remarked that the Thj'sanura, though extremely numerous, and in
many cases very pretty little creatures, liad attracted but little attention, owing,

perhaps, to their great delicacy and the consequent difficulty of preserving them in

a satisfactory condition. Under any decaying log of wood, under damp leaves, in

long grass, in short, in almost any damp situation, the Thysanura form no small pro-

portion of tlie population. Like other insects, they have six legs, but they never

acquire wings. I'he tail is generally provi-.Ied with two long appendages, which

are bent forward under the br.ciy, and thus form a spring, by means of which the
Aanimal is enabled to jump with great activity.
                                                 Smynt/iurus, for instance, mea-

suring one-tenth of an inch in diameter, will easily jump up twelve inches in the

air. This, however, is due mainly, not to muscular power, but to the elasticity of

 the spring. The muscles draw the spring forward and bring it under a small latch

 or catch ; directly this is relaxed, the elasticity of the organ jerks the spring back,

 and throws the creature upwards aud forwards. The author described in detail
 the muscles by which the spring is moved. Another remarkable peculiarity, and

 in the author's opinion the special characteristic of the Thysanura, is the presence,
 on the iirst abdominal ring, of a process which acts as a sucker in the Podurida?,
 and in Smynthiiriis gives rise to two long filaments which serve the same purpose.

 The author described the arrangements of the muscles by which this cmious appa-

ratus is moved. He then described tlie digestive and respiratory organs ; and after

 pointing out that Snvjntlmnis and Papirms, though very nearly allied in external
 character, differ entu-ely in their method of respiration, the latter genus being almost

 or entirely deficient in trachea?, he proposed, therefore, to form for it a new family,
which he proposed to call Papiiiidce.

    The total number of species amoiuits to fifty ; though this is not a large collec-
tion, many of the species are very rare. Of the forms for the first time noted in
 Britain are La-tmatonice Jilicornis, Kiuberg (and this he belieA'ed to be the same as

Amphicteis Gunneri, 8ars, and Hderonereis fucicola, ffirsted.

   Those at present considered new are a second species of Amphicteis, a pecu-
liar Lumhrinereis with eyes, a form allied to Travisia, but furnished Avith forked

bristles, a Troplionia, and an Idalia.

                                     By Dr. M'Ixtosh.

    The richness of the coast-line at St. Andrews in marine animals was pointed out
a state in some measure due to the varied habitat afforded by a smooth sandy beach
and a rocky border, with a large surface of tidal rocks. Its proximity to fertile co-
ralline gi'ound and the haunt of many deep-sea rarities, Avhich are tossed on shore
by storms or procured from the stomachs of fishes, all combine to render it a most
interesting field for the zoologist. Lists of species in the various departments were
given, and the most remarkable forms alluded to, such as Sac/ifta hipimctata, Mul-
yula (irenosa, and Pelonaia corrugata. The Mollusca number 170 species.

                On the Annelids of St. Andrews. By Dr. M'Intosh.

   The list of Turbellaria, Teretularia, and Annelida consists of 104 species, and
besides there are (5 Gephyrea.

   One of the Turbellaria is new to Britain, viz. Vortex capituta, ffirsted: one of
the Teretularia is also new, viz. a Porhsia, from deep water. He mentioned that he

bad observed no structural difference between Cephcdothrix riijifrons and C.Jiliformis,
aud none between Otnmafopka alba and O. rosea. The only ^' Parlasia" piirpwea,
Jolmst., met with in Britain is an Ommatoplean worm, which differs totally in
structure from a true Borlasian.

   Amongst the Annelids new to Britain are Ilalosydna r/elatinosa, Sars (Aletitia

f/clatinosa, Malmgren), and Nereis vircns, Sars (Alitta virens, jNIalmgren), b}^ far the

Nlargest British marine worm yet encountered. Nereis Sarsii, Eathke, a distinct

species, has been confounded with brevimaiia, Johnst., and consequently has not
been previously mentioned as British. The Si/dis armil/aris of Dr. Johnston in-
iudes two species, one of which abounds under stones between tide-marks, wliereas
the second comes only from deep water. Other additions to the British fauna
are Casfalia punctata, CErsted, Notophyllum pvlynoides, QCrsted, Phyllodvce (jran-
landica, ffirsted, Eunnda sanyidnea. Q']rsted, Eteonc pttsilla, Oersted, Amtnochares
Oftonis, Grube (probably the Ops diyitata of Dr. Carrington), and a Lciocejdudus.
The TertheUa Jli/idus of Dalyell is not T. constrictor, Montagu, but a distinct .species
with 24 pairs of biistle bundles, whereas T. constrictor has only 17 pairs. Physelia
zostei-icola, ffirsted {Nicolea zosfericola, Malmgren), is common.

The new species comprise a Lumbrinereis and a boldy marked brown Atitulytus.

Other interesting though not new species are Ilarmothoe Malmyreni, E. R.

Notice of Dredging by the late H. P. C. MoUer, off Fair Isle, between Orhney

   and Shetland. By 0. A. L. Morch, of Copenhagen. {Communicated by
   J. GwTN Jeffreys, F.li.S.)

    Ha7is Peter Christian Mciller, the author of 'Index MoUuscorum Groenlandire,'

was born at Elsinore on the 2nd of Xovember 1810. "When he had finished his

academical studies his love for concliologj^ took him to South Greenland, the mol-

lusca of which he investigated in compan}' with Captain HolboU from May 1838

to August 1840. After his return to Denmark, he spent several years there in con-

chologizing and dredging. In April 1843 he made a second voyage to the arctic

seas as inspector for the Danish colonies in North Greenland. On his return home

in  1844  he went to Italy for  his health                                                  but, being seized with a fever at Rome,
                                                                                         ;

he died on the 11th of October 184.3, at the early age of thirty-five. All his col-

lections were presented by his father, Dr. T. Moller, to the University Museum at

Copenhagen.

    During his voyage to Greenland in 1843 he made some hauls with the dredge at

Fair Isle (which he called Fairliill, in accordance with an old Danish chart) ; and

the result may be of some interest to British conchologists.

   The following is a translation of an extract from a letter of his, dated Egedes-
minde, Ctli September 1843 :--" I had several times during the voyage opportunities

of nsing my dredge, first in the Cattegat, then between Lindesues and the Skag,

and close to the coast of Norway. On the 10th of May we sighted Fairhill, and

the same day Sumburgh Head, where we lay nearlj' two days dredging, with a calm

sea and a beautiful sky. Although the bottom here is exceedingly uneven, and I

was in continual fear of losing my dredge, I used my time well, and was fortunate

enough not to have any such loss. About two milesf due east of Fairhill, in sixty

fathoms, a haul yielded clear shell-sand, with Cardium echiuatiim, Cyprina

Islandica, and numerous small dead shells. About half a mile nearer Fairliill

another haul at about tlie same depth yielded fine shell-sand, with single valves of

Mactra, Venus, &c. I got four large vessels full of clay and gravel, which gave me

constant work until I arrived at Cape Farewell. There were many interesting-

species; but most of the specimens were injured, I suppose in consequence of the

stormy seas which are prevalent in that part."

    Moller had himself labelled most of the specimens " FairhiU ;" so that there can-

not be any doubt in respect of the locality where he procured the species enume-

rated in the following list. Those species to which an asterisk is prefixed were in

a box of shell-sand marked " FairhiU." Some of the species have been determined

and named by Mr. Jeft'reys, and have the letter (J.) affixed to them.

aud other collectious, as so IDiely to be carried into efi'ect, that the jjroper time had

anived for pressing on Government the necessity of some changes in the adminis-

ti-ation of that institution. The most important of these changes was the transfer

of the control of the Museum from the Board of Trustees to a single officer appointed
Why Government and amenable to Parliament.
                                                     hile admitting the good which the

Trustees had done, and that their intentions had always been to benefit the institu-
tion, he maintained that the constitution of the Board, composed of men who, with

one or two exceptions, felt no interest in natural history, rendered it impossible that

they could do it justice. They naturally handed over their power to their chief

officers, who were thus invested with power without responsibility and beyond

appeal ; and although the public had great reason to be satisfied with the services
of these officers, there were points on which difference of opinion existed which

should not thus be placed beyond the reach of effectual remonstrance. The Board,

from the same causes, were slow to alter the existing order of things, or to make

the necessary alterations required by change of circumstances and times. He
gave the following illustration of this phase of their rule :--When the Museum

was young and ^\dthin manageable boimds, it was placed under one or two

head curators, minerals and fossils under one head, and zoology under another.

Each of these heads was allowed an assistant, and it was made a rule that

these assistants should not be above thirty years of age, the idea being

that they should be a sort of apprentices, who should begin young, and, on their

respective superior's decease or retirement, be ready to take his place. This ride

in itself was not a bad one. It secm-ed always one good man and one learning to

become a good man. If the superior officer died before his assistant was qualified

to  succeed  him, it  was not  essential  that  the  assistant  should  be  put  into  his place
                                                                                                                                 ;

and as the regulation as to age applied only to assidanfs, it was no barrier in the

way of putting an older man in the upper place. But as the collection grew, it

was found that more heads were wanted, and then came the error. Instead of

appointing new heads coequal with the previous heads for each department, the

number of assii<fnnt cm-ators was increased, aud one set apart to each different
depai-tment, so that each department had, and has now, only one man to it. If any

of them die or retire, there is no person to take their work ; and being nominally

assistant curators, although practically head curators, no one can be appointed to

--their place who is above thirty years of age in other words, no one who knows

his business ; for the study of the Natural vSciences is so vast that to constitute

vouth in such appointments a, sine qitd non, is reaUy to say that the candidate must

be appointed before he has acquired them, and before he has sho^vn any power of

acquirino- them. The British Museum has thus the unenviable distinction of beingthe

--sole place in the whole world where ignorance of a man's duties is not only no impedi-

ment to his appointment but a qualification nay, not only a qualification, but actually

a sine qiui non. Had the Trustees seen the working of this, they would, instead of ap-

pointing assistant curators, have appointed head curators, with such assistant curators

as were necessary. And then for each department requiring it we should have had

--two officers one a competent, experienced man of position and weight in the

scientific world, the other a young assistant, to whose charge ignorance of his

duties could not be laid, seeing that his duties vfere to learn, not to teach. The

author considered it plain that we must come back to this original arrangement.

These so-called assistant curators, who have long adminstered their respective

departments with credit to themselves and the iluseum, must be recognized as

head curators, and assistant curators, properly so called, supplied to them ; while

head curators, selected from the best ranks of men of science, should be appointed

to those other departments which require them. The author pointed out some of
the defects and inequalities in the arrangement of the materials in the Museum

more especially in the Tnvertebrata. An immense deal had been done in procuring

materials, but from want of hands the greatest part of it was practically useless to

men of science. He ccmi-idered that what was now wanted was less of the acqui-
sition of novelties than tlio utilization of those which the Museum already pos-

sessed ; and he pressed the importance of establishing, to a much greater extent than
has hitherto been done, Ihe system of exchange of duplicates with other museums

and individuals which has been found so valuable by other institutions.

              Oil the Nature and Systematic Position of the Grajjtolitidce.

               By Henry Alleyne Nicholson, D.Sc., M.B., F.O.S.

   The author of this paper, after reviewing- the various theories wliicli have been
held as to the nature and affinities of the Uraptolitidte, endeavoured to show that

--they should be referred to the Hydrozoa a view which he believed was supported

by their morphology, development, and reproduction, by their mode of existence,
and by the determination of allied forms. The " common canal " of the Graptolite
was shown to be strictly analogous to the " coeuosarc " of the Hydrozoa, no similar

structure existing in any Bryozoon, whilst the " cellules " found their nearest re-
presentative in the " hydrotheca; " of the Sertularians. It was further pointed
out that there existed, in several species of the genera Dichor/rapsus, Tetra-
ffrapsus, and Diployrapsug, an organ whicli had been compared with the basal
plate of Dcfrcincia, a JBiyozoon, by Prof. Huxley, but which was more probably
homologous with the " tioat " or " pneumatophore " of the Physophoridae, an
order of the oceanic Hydrozoa.

   As regards their reproduction the author drew attention to the bodies first de-
scribed by Hall in America and by himself iu Britain, and considered to be the
" ovarian capsules " of Graptolites. He pointed out, further, tlie resemblance of
these to the "gonophores" of the recent Hydrozoa, both in their shape, and as
regarded the changes through which they were observed to pass.

   With regard to the mode of existence of the Graptolitidai, it was shown that by

--far the majority must have been free and permanently imattached a fact highly

adverse to the belief that they belonged to the Polyzoa.
   Lastly, the author noticed the occurrence of a form, originally described by him-

self under tlie name of Corynoides calicularis, closely allied to the true Graptolites,

but apparently representing the order CorynidiB (or Tubularidre).

    In conclusion, the author stated it as his belief that the Graptolitidaj could not be
referred to any existing order, or eyen subclass, of the Hydrozoa, but that they
stood in the same relation to existing forms that the Trilobites hold to the recent

Crustacea. In their mode of growth, in the arrangement of their parts, and in the
natiu-e of their structural elements they were seen to resemble the Ilydroid polypes

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

but they were widely separated by their free " hydrosoma." On the other hand,

the}' approximated to tiie oceanic Hydrozoa in the fact that they were free-
Hoating organisms, and in the possession, by some forms, of an organ resembling a

"float." On the whole the author was of opinion that the Graptolitidie should be
held to constitute a new subclass intermediate in position between the fixed and

the oceanic Hydrozoa, and that the}' might possibly, on the derivative theory of
development, be looked upon as the primitive stock from which the above existing
sections of our li\iug Hydrozoa had originally diverged.

                       skerries, Shetland. By C. W. Peach.

  In May 1864, when in Shetland with Mr. J. G. Jeffreys on a dredging excur-

sion, Miss Jeffreys found some fine specimens of Griffithsia corallina, wliich, on
examination, the author found in fruit and in fine condition. I'nder the micro-
scope he observed a circular opening in the lower part of the joint above the fruit
(tetraspores), from which opening the granular pulp of the joint was poured on
the fruit under it. Harvey, iu his introduction to his 'British Marine Algie,' gives
a long account of the fructification ; but there is nothing in it that fully agrees with

the above.

   The author first stated that during his residence in Edinburgh he had oppoiiuni-
ties of examiniug books not before accessible to him; by these he found that many

of the naked-eyed medusEC that he had found were new to the British list. He then

described one he got in Cornwall in 1849, which he thought was Willsia stcl-
lala of Forbes, but after carefvd examination, and comparing it with others, is
satisfied that it is a new species, and has named it Willsia Cornuhica ; it has only

   twelve tentacles. His next new one is a Tiina, which he has named Tima Forheiii,
   in memory of the late Professor E. Forbes ; the principal diftereuce between it
   and Tima Bairdii is that instead of having only sixteen tentacles, in it they are

   numerous. Several others came in for their share of notice, and then he mentioned

   Goodsireamirahilis, a new genus founded by Dr. T. Strethill ;AVright, and published

   by him in the second volume of the Transactions of the Royal Physical Society

   of Edinburgh. The author got this speicmen at Peterliead in 1851. He fully con-

   firmed Dr. Wright's observations, and added that some of his specimens had two

   additional, but  shorter  tentacles than Dr. Wright's                                                                                                         he thought this  only a sexual

   difterence. He then described what he considered the most cm-ious of all he had

   seen, a new genus {Staurophora) to the British shores, and the largest naked-eyed

   Medusa hitherto noticed in our seas. It was first found in the Pacific by Mertens

   when on a voyage round the world ; since foimd by Agassiz in Boston Bay, America,
   in 1849, and was described by him in a paper entitled " Contributions to the Na-

   tural History of the Accdephce of North America." The umbrella is crossed by

   four gastrovascular canals; from each of them hang two curtain-like masses; and,

   to appearance, it has neither mouth nor stomach. However, by parting the curtains

   both are to be seen. He described it at great length, and stated that he got it ofi"

   Peterhead several times in 1851, and that it grew from in. in breadth to 3| in. in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          -J;

                        By the llev. H. B. Tmsxkam, M.A., F.li.S.

      The rapid extension and epidemic character of the grouse-disease was attributed
   in great measure to the indiscriminate slaughter of predatory animals. These, it
   was true, destroj^ed game, but it was only the weakest and tlie most diseased ani-
   mals that they could make a prey of. In this way disease was stamped out, as

   had been artificially done with the cattle plague. He commented severely on the

   encouragement given by landed proprietors to the destruction of wild animals,
   complaining that upon this question game-preservers were more open to be in-
   fluenced by ignorant gamekeepers than by naturalists. The grouse-disease had
   existed sporadically for at least two years before it was generally noticed.

     ferences of Colour and the Mode of Nidification in Birds. By Alfred R.
      Wallace, F.R.G.S., F.L.S.

      The author pointed out the hitherto unnoticed fact, that whenever female birds
   resembled the males in being adorned with gay and conspicuous colours, their nests

   were so placed or so constructed as to conceal the sitting bird. He sliowed that

   this generalization was supported by a vast number of facts in all the chief groups
   of birds, while the exceptions were few and unimportant, and concluded by point-
   ing out its correspondence with the general principle of protection in modifying
   colour, and by arguing that the whole of the phenomena could be well explained
   on the theory of the preservation of useful variations.

capable of enabling us to make out of its substance, ai'tificially, on a glass slide,

ber of preparations, exhibiting organic forms and textiu'es thus consh'ucted. lie

regi-etted that neither the time nor the aiTangements of the Section were of a kind

which woidd enable the histologists present to examine them. He had displayed

one preparation under the microscope, however, which he believed to be unique,
as it demonstrated that molecules possessed in themselves the power of arranging

themselves into nucleated cell-forms, without any previous ceU-formations.

   The first step in the line of discovery which indicated the physical conditions
necessary for the formation of animal and vital textures was, in his opinion, made

by Ascherson in 1840, who showed how the mere contact of oil and albmnen
produced a molecular membrane called haptogen meiubrane. The second step was

the determination by Rainej' of the influence of viscidity and limpidity in liquids,
Acausing in them the precipitation of globidar and crystalline forms.
                                                                       third

step consisted in demonstrating the difficulty with which these viscous or colloid

substances pass through membranes, as compared with liquids, for which Ave are
Aindebted to the researches of Graham.
                                           fovu-th step he considered was the de-

monstration that the diaphanous or hyaline bodies, so long known to histologists,

consisted of a glutinous substance formed in cells, which coidd be squeezed out of

them by pressure, as lately shown by the author *. Lastly, the experiments with
protagon by Montgomery "t liad shown that this peculiar viscous material, when

mingled A\'ith water, albumen, glycerine, serum, or other substances, and acted

itpon by acetic or nitric acids, could be made to assume the form of fibres, vari-

cose tubes, nucleated cells (simple and compound), pus-corpuscles, and bodies

which, like salivary cells, exhibited numerous granules in their interior, possessing

active molecular movements. All these researches tended to clear up the nature

of a midtitude of facts, long known to histologists, to several of which Dr. Bennett

refen'ed, and which had led him to the folloMang conclusions :

1. That our present knowledge of the physical conditions necessary for the for-i

mation of elementary structures indicates the vast importance of studjaug the

relations, chemical, mechanical, and structural, of the fatty, albuminous, and

mineral constituents of the animal frame.

2. That the constant formative and disintegrative processes occurring among

these constituents is largely due to chemical and mechanical action, especially

pressm-e and friction.

3. That the differentiation between these elements is also attributable to the

physical properties of viscidity' and limpidity, the fonuer tending to produce glo-

bular, and the latter linear or crystalline forms.

4. That these viscous and limpid fluids exist in the living body, are constantly

influenced by mixture, pressure, and endosmose, and may frequently be seen, espe-

cially in morbid products, to originate formation by molecular deposition, and so-

called nuclei, cells, and fibres by molecular aggregation.

.5. That these facts throw great light upon the circumstances necessary for the

production of elementary structures, but leave our conception of vital properties

and of vital tendencies pretty much as it was, viz. rmlvnown powers inherent in

the tissues generally, determining their- development and regulating their action.

New Invesfif/ations to determine the Amount of Bile secreted h>/ the Liver, and
   how far this is injluenced hy Mercurials. By Prof. Htigiies Bennett, M.D.,

    F.E.S.E. 4-c.

   The author stated that, although much had been written regarding the func-

tions of the liver, and the action upon it of mercurials, very little exact informa-
tion existed on the subject. Last winter a Committee had "been formed in Edin-

burgh to reinvestigate the amoimt of liile secreted in health, and how far such

secretion was influenced by merciny. It was composed of Profs. Christison and
Maelagan, of the Edinburgh University, Dr. James Rogers, formerly of St. Peters-
bnrgh, Drs. Eutlierford, Gamgee, and Fraser, Assistants in the Edinburgh Univer-
sity, and of Prof Bennett, the Chairman and Reporter.

   After studying all that had been previously published by authors (an able
Report on which had been furnished by Dr. Rogers), the Committee first took into
consideration what method it was best for them to pursiie. It was then pointed
out by Dr. Gamgee that, in the opinion of modern chemists, no kind of examination
of the fa;ces could yield trustworthy results. Supposing that the chief and cha-

racteristic constituents of the bile found their way into the faeces vmchanged, im-

perfections in the analytical methods at our disposal rendered its quantitative ana-
lysis impossible. The plan of ascertaining the amount of bile-acids indirectly by
means of nitrogen and sidphur determinations of the alcoholic extract, while most

unsatisfactoiT in the case of pure bile, is still more so when applied to the alcoholic
exti-act of fffices. The method of Hoppe-Seyler of Tubingen, who calculated the
amount of bile-acids from the effect which their solutions exert upon a ray of

polarized light, presents such complexity and difficult}' as to render its systematic
employment in any series of analj-ses altogether inapplicable. As to the colouring-

matters of bile, there is no direct method known by which they can be estimated.
It was further argued that, did we even possess means of estimating the bile pro-
ducts, it is only a small portion of such as are secreted by tlie liver which can be
foimd in the alvine discharges. Bidder and Schmidt ascertained that the amount
of nnoxidized sulphur in them only represented one-eighth part of the total sulphur
which the liver secretes, and that of the other constituents of the bile the larger

proportion are absorbed. That under the influence of pm-gatives unchanged bile is
occasionally discharged from the bowel, is true, but this furnishes no proof of any
increase of that secretion ; for under ordinaiy circumstances it is decomposed and
absorbed in the alimentary canal, and any cause which increases the rapidity of
its passage there must render absoi-ption and decomposition less complete. These
arguments convinced the Committee that no accurate information as to the
amount of bile secreted by the liver was to be obtained hy an examination of the
freces. They therefore resolved that the collection of bile directly through arti-
ficial fistuhe made with the gall-bladder was the only means open to them of de-

tenuining how far mercury influenced that secretion.
   Prof. Bennett then described the efforts made to establish fistulse in fom-teen dogs,

and the apparatus which had been constructed to collect the bile and prevent its
being distm-bed by the animal. · The investigations were carefully conducted by

Dr. W. Rutherford and Dr. Gamgee, occasionally assisted byDi-. Fraser, and super-
intended by the Committee. He gave, in a tabidar form, the results of fom- series

of experiments to detei-mine the amoimt of bile secreted without and with mer-
cm-y. It was soon observed that the amount of bile obtained vaiied gTeatly from
day to day, irrespective of the amoimt of food and drink given, or any other known

circumstance. This pointed out a serious fallacy in the observations of previous

experimenters, who had been satisfied with estimating the amount of bile formed

by collecting it for a few hoiu's, or at most for one or two days. In each series of
experiments, an average of the collections was taken for six entire days, first with-
out and then with mercurj', and the quantities obtained were calculated so as to
determine the amount of bile as compared with each kilogramme of the dog's weight

and each kilogramme of the dog's food. In many important respects the results

obtained dift'ered from those of previous investigators. It is unnecessary to repro-

duce the tables and observations made in this abstract, because it was pointed out
that further researches were required before so difficult and intricate a subject

could be siifiiciently investigated to wan'ant the formation of conclusions. All

that need be stated at present is, that in the experiments hitherto made, mercmy

had not caused any sensible effects either upon the biliary or urinary secretions.
The author concluded by observing that, shoiild the Section consider'the researches
of the Committee so far deserving of encouragement as to be a.ssisted by a small
grant fi'om the funds of the Association, he hoped to be enabled to report more

definite results next year.

On the Epithelium of the Cornea of the Ox in relation to the Growth of Stra-

                  tified Epithelium. By Professor Clelai\'d, M.D.

   In this communication evidence was brought forward to show that in the epithe-
lium of the cornea the cells of the deepest stratum, which are columnar, degenerate
and disappear -without becoming more superficial. It was pointed out that next to
these columnar cells were others of greater breadth sending in processes between
them, and that superticial to these were small cells, many of them with two nuclei,
and likewise many free nuclei, and that beyond this stratum the cells became gra-
dually larger, flatter, and more solid the nearer they were to the free surface. In con-
clusion it was pointed out that although the circumstances of nutrition in the case
of the corneal epithelium were too singular to permit our safely assuming that other
sti'atified epithelia grev.r in the same manner, yet the facts brought forward were
sufficient to show that in these structm-es the deepest cells were not necessarily the
youngest, and that cells might be removed from them by other means besides pass-

ing to the sm-face.

      On some Points connected tvith the Joints and Ligaments of the Hand.
                              By Professor Cleland, M.D,

   The following were the principal points brought forward :
    In flexion and extension of the MTist tlie semilunar bone slides backwards and
forwards between the scaphoid and cuneiform ; and in over-extension of the wrist
it is supported by two ligaments, which descend and converge to be attaclied on
its palmar surface, precisely according to the principle by means of which the
sacrum is suspended between the haunch-bones.
   In the metacarpo-phalangeal articulations lateral movement is prevented in
flexion while it is allowed in extension, by the lateral ligaments taking origin from
points nearer the cxtremitv' than the front of the metacarpal bone, and by the distal
ends of the metacarpal bones being much broader in front than behind, so that the
lateral ligaments are sti'etched over the broad part in flexion. The arrangement

gives sti'ength in grasping.
    Strong ligaments, hitherto undescribed, extend from the sides of the phalanges

near the phalangeal articulations, and are inserted into the sldn, helping to retain the
difl'erent parts of the integument in the positions which they are adapted to occupy.

                   Microscopical Preparation of the Kerves of the Cornea.

                             By Professor Cleland, M.D.

   This preparation, which consisted of a considerable portion of the superficial
layers of tlie cornea of a sheep, exhibited a perfect network continued from nerves
all of which entered at the periphery. Tlie cords of the network, although placed
at slightly varying levels, united to form a single stratum ; they appeared to con-

sist each of se^·eral fibres." No terminations of nerves could be seen, nor any flbres

given oft' from the network, either to the surface or deep parts of the cornea.

On a new form of Cephalopodous Ova. By Dr. Collingwood, M.A., F.L.8.

Tliis paper was a description, accompanied by drawings, of a remarkable body,

found in the North Atlantic Ocean, consisting of a large number of ova imbedded

in a transparent jelly resembling frog's spawn, and floating freely in the sea. The

ova proved, on examination, to be those of some species of Cephalopod, but dif-

ferent in character from any otlier known form. The author compared it with the

described forms deposited bj' Octopus, Sepia, Si'pioteuthus, LoUyo, &c., to none of

which  it bore  any resemblance                                                                               and  he  exhibited  microscopic  drawings of  the

                             By Jonx Davy, M.D., F.Ii.S.

   In this paper the author described a certain number of experiments, the results
of whicli showed how much longer some animals are capable of resisting privation

of air than others. Thus, in one instance, an egg', an inchoate animal, so to speak,

--was liatched, producing a healthy chicken, after having- heen acted on by the

air-pump 26 daj-s, a young bird expiring in about half a minute, a fish, the
minnow, in about an hour ; the frog and toad in about the same time ; the earth-

worm in about an hoiu' and a half; insects, such as the bee, dragonfly, and but-

terfly, after apparent death for more than an hour, recovering on exposm-e to the
air, and that repeatedly.

   By other experiments on birds by means of submersion in water, he showed that

different species varied greatly in ability to bear exclusion of air : thus, while all

the smaU birds of which he had made trial expired under water in a minute or less,
the buzzard lived about two minutes and a half; the common fowl about four
minutes and a half ; the goose and duck about ten minutes.

   Reasoning on the results, he infers tliat each indi\ddual animal has something

peculiar in its organization, determining its peculiarities of function or action-

peculiarities more readily described than accounted for. He holds the subject to
be, in a great measure, mysterious ; nor is he sanguine, referring to the new and

ingenious views relative to the genesis of species, that they will tend, except par-

tially, to enlighten the subject, considering that life itself is a mystery, and the
origination of life, as regards natural science, an unsolved problem.

Vocal and other Influences vpon Manlind, from Pendency of the Ej^iffhttis.

                    By George Duncan Gibb, M.A., M.D., LL.D.

   The author gave the results of his examination with the laryngoscope of 4600
healthy persons, of all .ages, both sexes, and varying positions of life, which showed
that in 51.3 the epiglottis was found to be quite pendent, in place of a vertical

position. He determined that this was hereditary in many instances, for it was

found in the mother and her child. This made the percentage to be 11 amongst
Europeans ; but it was found to bo much greater in the natives of Asia and Africa,

280 of whom he had examined. The influences observed in Europeans were a

modiflcation of the natiual voice, which tended towards a bass tone in adult
males; the singing voice was materially altered, and in the female sex the higher
notes could not be produced at all in some persons, whilst in others it weakened
their vocal power and compass. Tlie author had never known a great female

singer to possess a pendent epiglottis. He contrasted the direction of the voice

in cases of erect and pendent epiglottis ; in the latter tlie voice strikes the back of

the throat, behind, instead of in front of, the soft palate. Young girls with pen-

dency can never expect to become singers of any note imless it be remedied, and
in them, and in boj's too, the A-oiee is not clear and silvery as it ought to be. Cer-
tain constitutional peculiarities were also noticed, and there was a predisposition
to contract the exanthemata and other diseases of an epidemic nature. The author
concluded by refen-ing to the large number of pendencies in Britain, over 3,000,000,
and the means to be taken to remedv it.

               Observations tvith the Spectroscope on Animcd Substances.

                                  By E. Hat Laneestee.

  By means of dark bands produced in the prismatic specti'um (when light is

transmitted through coloured solutions) it has been shown, by Hoppe-Seyler and

by Prof. Stokes, of Cambridge, that various colom-ed bodies may be definitely re-
cognized. Mr. Sorby has also made many observations of vegetable colours, and
in\-ented a very convenient form of spectroscope. The author's observations were
made upon various coloured substances in the lower animals ; by this means he had
detected chloroph}d in Hydra and the fresliwater Sjwnyilla, which had before been
suspected to be present, but of which there was no certaintj^ In various worms
(Etnncc, Lmnhricus, Hlrudo'), in an insect-larva {Chironomus), and in a moUusk

(Phinorhis) he had found the same red substance (cruorine) discovered by Stokes

in tlie blood of man and vertebrates. This was remarkable, since the red matter
was deficient in nearly all mollusks and insects ; and, moreover, in vertebrates it was

did. It was very desirable that fui'ther observations shoidd be made with the

Notes of E.vperiments tvith Poisons 4'c. on Young Salmon. By Dr. M'I>'iosii.

These experiments were performed in 18G2 and 18(33 on newly hatched fish,

which, from their transparency, are very favourable subjects. The most numerous

were those with Flem. tinct. of aconite, which at fii'st caused STOiptoms of irrita-

tion, with twitchings and considerable muscular movement. The heart's action

by-and-by became irregular, and then a remarkable tendencj' to more rapid

motion oi the auricle appeared, with a slowing of the ventricular action, and the

latter became more marked as the paralysis of the umseles generally increased.

Under the action of this poison some veiy interesting obseiTations may l;e made oir

the heart's action ; and from the nou-rhythmical movements of the cavities, a
halt was now and then caused by the contractions occurring at the same time.

The general residt was that the auricle contracted twice for each ventricular action.

This condition was independent of the respiratory process. Other drugs experi-

mented with were tinct. digitalis, creosote, sulphuric ether, chloric ether, mor-

Aphia, chloroform, bleachiug-powder, anmionia, &c.  few minims of a solution of

bleaching-powder proved rapidh^ ftital ; and though the fish was placed imder

running water in a few minutes, and before motion ceased, it did not recover.

Muscular irritability and con\-ulsive movements continued for about a minute

after the heart's action had ceased under chloroform. Considerable vitality was

exhibited when the iish was placed in sea-water, death ensuing slowly from cardiac

congestion caused by the shrivelling of the superficial textures, and consequent

shutting up of the blood-channels; and secondly, from a peculiar coagulation

and hardening of the yelk-sac and the resulting interference with nutrition. The

tentacles of an anemone (Tealia crassicornis) did not appear to exert a poisonous or

paralyzing action, but the young fish died slowly from the physical injuries in-

iiicted by the dart-cells, llegeneration of artificial wounds rapidly ensued, and

when the tip of the tail M'as cut ott'some curious etiects were observed in regard

to the clot which formed at the tip of the artery.

On the Adaptation of tlie Structure of the Shell of the Bird's Egy to the

                   Function of liespiration. By Dr. G. Ogilvie.

   The principal object of this paper was to call attention to the constant occm-reuce
of a cavernous stratum on the interior of the shell of the egg, formed by a series of

wartj' excrescences from the calcai'eous crust, and covered in by the lining mem-

brane of the shell, which adheres so intimately to the points of the tubercles tliat
a fleecy film is always left when the membrane is torn oft" from the inside of the
shell, and in many cases can be removed only by burning it oft' by calcination,

though the uatm-e of the sti-uctm-e may be shown in other ways, as by sections and

the use of aniline dyes, which tinge the fibrous tissue, witli little or no efl'ect on the
shell proper. The penetration of the external air into the cavernous structure,
tlu-ough the overlj'ing stratum of the calcai'eous crust, is facilitated by the pore-Hke
pits un the outside of the shell, which, though in many cases they do not go directly

cavernous sti'atimi has a certain analogy with the structoe of the internal tissue

of leaves, amounting, indeed, in some cases to so close a resemblance that one
might readily compare the shell of some chelouiau reptiles to the parenchyma of a

leaf which had undergoue calcification ; and as in the egg-shell we have the pore-

like pits on the outer sm-face to facilitate the permeation of the air to the subjacent
stratiun, so in floating leaves, which have their stomata on the upper epidermis,

we generally have some arrangement to lessen the obsti'uctive influence of the
layer of compact tissue between them and the spongy pai'enchyma below. Of this
perhaps we have the most striking example in the lai'ge tapering cells in the leaf of
the White Water Lily, which, when exposed to the action of an aniUne dye, become

very conspicuous objects from the readiness with which they take in the colom-;

they somewhat resemble a series of nails diiven through the compact tissue, with

their flattened heads immediately under the stomata, and their points projecting

into the air-spaces below. As another example of such an arrangement, reference
was made to the vacuity under each stomatic opening in the upper layer of paren-
chyma in the leaf of the common pond-weed.

    On the Antiseptic Properties of the Sulphites. By Dr. Polli, of Milan.

   Sidphurous acid was said to be the most active agent in arresting all organic fer-
mentation. As the acid, however, was not easily applicable in experiment, Dr.
Polli had undertaken an investigation as to the action of the sulphites of Hme,
hyposidphite of magnesia, sulphite of magnesia, and sulphite of soda. These sub-
stances were found to possess all the properties of sulphm'ous acid, with the advan-
tage that their action was more miiform and certain and constant. In experi-
menting on animals and himself, he found that large doses could be taken without
risk. On killing animals treated with sulphites, and others not so ti'eated, he found
that the former were most slow to decompose, and, indeed, remained quite fresh
when the others were putrescent and oflensive. Ajiother series of experiments
showed that in one class the administration of the sulphites was sufficient to efiect
a more or less rapid cure in cases where blood-poisoning was present, as in fevers,
Ur. Polli was anxious to have it clearly stated that he did not attribute this to any
curative power in the sulphites, but to the fact that they arrested decomposition, and
by so doing allowed the animal to recover by the recuperative power existing in its

own constitution. The author thought his observations conclusive as to the excel-

lent influence of the sidphites on certain diseases.

    After adverting to the wonderful effects of the composite natm'e of the solar rays,

and to the circmnstance that water of all fluids next to the air is the medium most

intimately connected with animal and vegetable life, the author gives an account

of the effects he has observed when he has concentrated the solar rays on nu-

merous bodies immersed in water.
   The most remarkable results were those obtained in experimenting on small

fishes and frogs. To the former the action of the rays, when concentrated upon
the head, was immediately fatal ; of the latter the slrin was shrivelled and disco-
lom-ed. Even on his own hand the efiect was immediately perceptible, pain followed
by inflammation.

to the stimulating agencies present in the solar raj^s, iiTespective of the actual heat

of the latter ; and it is thus rendered probable that it is not the calorific element of

'their actinic or chemical part chiefly operates in these cases, or -whether another

active power nearly allied to electricity, or the nervous force itself, is really con-

   Two inncnninate arteries arose from the transverse part of the arch of the aorta;

the right bifurcated, and by one branch gave origin to the carotis cerebralis, carotis
facialis, and subclavian arteries, by the other to the cervico-occipitalis and the
art. thoracica posterior dextra. The left iimominate gave origin to a small thyroid
artery and then bifurcated : its anterior branch divided into carotis facialis and
subcla-N'ia sinistra ; its posterior branch into carotis cerebralis and cervico-occipi-
talis. The art. thoracica post, sinistra arose from the back of the arch close to its
junction with the ductus arteriosus. Tlie cerebral carotids diminished very much
in size before entering the .«kull, as Shai-pey and Yon Baer had already shown in
the porpoise. Q'he weight of the brain was 58 oz., and the amount of blood con-

vej-ed to it by these arteries was much less than in the adult human brain, so that

the functional activity is necessarily slower than in the brain of Man.

the first three subdivisions of the stomach of the poiiioise. Tlie 4th compartment

in the Pilot Whale is not difl'orentiated in the porpoise, but the .5th compartment
corresponds to the 4th or sigmoid stomach of the porpoise. Between it and the
cylindrical duodenum was a dilatation, which differed from the dilated commence-
ment of the duodenum in the porpoise in not having the hepatico-pancreatic duct

opening into it.

   These and other details are given much more fully in the ' Journal of Anatomy
and Physiology,' November 1867.

   Microscopic preparations in illustration of the ultimate arrangement of the bile-
passages and of the minute anatomy of the nervous sj-stem were exhibited by

Prof Turner. The preparations were made by Mr. A. B. Stirling, Assistant in
the Anatomical Museum, University of Edinburgh. Tlie sections of the liver,
from the rabbit, served to confirm the recent views of Ilering and others, that the
bile passes to the periphery of the lobules in channels, which lie between and have
their walls fonued by the liver-cells, and wliicli communicate with the interlo-

bular branches of the hepatic duct.

Two years have elapsed since, in the mouth of September ISG-S, jaded with the

of my journey my wife returned to civilization from a land of savages, from the

and Grant, we had secnred for England the merit of the discovery of the Nile-

--sources. ... I have received many rewards for this long- period of trial and

difficulty in African research, the approbation of Her Majest}^, the gold medals

of the Royal Geographical Societies of both England and France, and the cordial

reception of the account of our travels given in the ' Albert N'j-anza Great Basin

of the Nile ;' but believe me when I assure you that I esteem as one of the highest

honours the compliment that has been bestowed by the British Association, by their

invitation that I should occupy the position of President of their geographical

section.

  When I look upon my right hand and upon my left, and hnd myself supported

by those veterans of science and of industry, by those men whose heads have grown

grey in the pursuit of liuowledge, and whose intellects, enriched by the experience

of a long life, we regard with reverence and esteem, I feel with much humility that
I am a usurper of tlie Presidential chair which has been so ably and so honourably

filled by Sir Roderick Murchison and by Mr. Crawfurd, the time-honoured Presi-

dents of the Royal Geographical and tlie Ethnological Societies.

   But, as the younger trees grow up beneath the branches of the venerable oaks

and prosper in their shade, even so I venture to rise between my much-honoured

supporters, and recall to recollection the important fact that the high and prominent

position now held by the geographical section in the proceedings of the British

Association is due to the labour and untiring energ}' of Sir Roderick Murchison, to

whom belongs the merit of having given to Geography an independent place in the

Meetings of tliis general parliament of science.

Geograph}' is worthy of this high position, as nearly every science is dependent

upon our knowledge of the earth.

   Astronomy would alFord meagre results were we ignorant of the spherical form of
our world, and were our observations confined to our own cloudy shores ; but our

observations are directed from stations in all positions on the globe, the knowledge

of those positions being due to our first explorers.

Ethnology is a twin sister of geographical science, as the numerous races of human

beings (so diverse and inexplicable) that inhabit the various portions of the earth,

from the ice-bound regions of the Arctic to the burning deserts of Africa, would
have been unknown but for the researches of geographers and explorers.

Theology is closely interwoven with the study of geography                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  tlie history of man
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

from the remote beginning is linked with a description of the creation of the world,

when God said, " Let us make man in our own image." From that time the very

elements of our creed are connected with particular positions upon the earth's sur-

face. The most important events that have influenced the march of civilization

and the .spread of Christianity have occurred in certain places that throw intense

interest upon the science of geography. The wanderings of certain nomadic ti-ibes
seeking for new pastures for their flocks have brought to light new countries, and

have implanted new religions. The arrival from Chaldea of Abraham, the simple

Arab chieftain with his followers who settled in a new country, laid the foundation

of our Jewish history, followed by those mighty events at distant intervals, the

Exodus from Egypt, the buildino- of Jerusalem, the birth of Christ, the Roman con-

quest, until at length, by the victories of Caisar, the ^^^est was rescued from its

savagedom, and the road was opened to Great Britain, to be followed by the light

of truth. All tliis wonderful train of progression is based on geography ;'^and, as St.

Paul with untiring zeal journeyed often " in perils of waters, in perils'of robbers, in

perils by the heathen, in perils in the wilderness, in weariness and painfulness, in

hunger and thirst, in cold and nakedness," even so the missionary and the explorer

have united in patiently boring their way through lands that have lain hidden since

the world's creation                                                                                             and  these countries have  risen to the first rank in the earth's
                                                                                                              ;

history. Far-distant lands, tenanted by savage races that knew no God, rescued

from a state of barrenness, are smiling with prosperity; the wild beasts and the

heathen have retreated before advancing civilization, and tlie sound of the church-

bell rings at our very antipodes. Thus is religion linked with tlie study of the

earth. The advancement of Christianity is dependent upon the migrations of

Christians that shall implant the seed of truth in foreign soils. Those migrations
                                                                                                                                                              :

are dependent upon geographical discoveries that shall bring to light coimtries and

climates favourable to the development of European races. Thus civilization v^^ill ad-

vance to a higher standard in such latitudes as are conducive to industry and enter-

prise                     the  severity' of an Arctic region would be as great a barrier to the intellectual
                       ;

Srogress of the inhabitants as would the burning sun and barren sand of the desert where

Tatm-e has withheld every blessing from mankind. In such localities the hmnan

energies are overpowered by the oppression of circumstances, and a high standard

of civilization can never be attained. If, therefore, civilization be mainly dependent

upon temperature and geographical position, it will be exliibited in the highest de-
gTee within particular latitudes comprised iu the temperate zone; The discovery of

coimtries that afford the requisite conditions for such advancement has been the

gi'andest residt of comparatively modern geography. In tracing the progress of

geographical science from the earliest period of iiistory, we are struck with the

marvellous strides eft'ected during the last three centm-ies.

  When we consider that the Mosaical history accounts, for 4004 years from the
creation of the first man until the birth of Christ, and thus establishes the recorded
existence of man for a period of 5871 years to the present day, we nmst regard with

the most intense interest the mysterious development of the world during that space

of time.

The Phoenicians were the most ancient maritime power described in history, the

ports of TjTe and Sidon ha\'ing been their London and Liverpool. Even at the

remote date when Pharoah Necho governed Egypt, the Phoenicians are said to

have cii'cumnavigated Afi'ica, having passed tlirougli a canal from the Mediter-

ranean to tlie Red Sea, and returned to Egypt by the Straits of Gibraltar. Thus

--wasm3'sterious Africa sailed around at that remote age, an object of barren wonder

to the mariners, who were amazed to find the rising sun upon tlieir right hand in-

stead of on their left upon rounding tlie Cape of Good Hope from the east and

coasting north.

The Phoenicians are supposed to have traded with England, and to have obtained

tin from Cornwall ; they founded Carthage, whicli subsequently gave birth to the

adventurous explorer Planno^ who coasted the western shores of Africa to near the

Equator.

In those days the principal objects of exploration were commerce and conquest

there was no Roj'al Geographical Society, with a JNIurchisou as President, to support

the love of science and adventure ; but the report of tlie explorer, if successful, was,

as in the case of Cresar, Veni, vidi, vici !

The voyages of the ancients were generally confined to coasting or to crossing

narrow seas by the guidance of the stars, iu precisely the same manner as performed

at the present day by tjje Arabs in navigating the Persian Gulf and the lied Sea.

There can be little doubt that they were acquainted with India and Ceylon, as the

presents of peacocks to Solomon must have been brought from one of those coun-
tries, that species of bird being imkuown in Africa. The conquests of Alexander

extended geographical knowledge into the far interior of India; and the founding of

^Vlexandria added an important seaport to the Mediterranean.
   Although the enterprise of the Greeks and the Phoenicians had overcome the

difficidties of the Mediterranean, and had establislied trading-stations upon the east

--coast of Afi'ica, their explorations were boimded by that impassable barrier to the

west the mysterious Atlantic Ocean. They had visited Zanzibar, and doubtless

they had penetrated far into the interior of Eastern Africa, and had heard of the
existence of the great lakes which Ptoleni}' long afterwards placed upon his map,

from  the                 description  of native  merchants,  as  the  sources  of tiie Nile                                                   but from  the

beginning of the world up to the fifteenth centuiy, no human eye had pierced the

mystery of the Atlantic. At that time there were two great geographical questions

--to be solved the Nile and the Atlantic.

The fifteenth century was rich in geographical discovery. Marco Polo's travels in

Asia had brought renown to Venice ; and Vasco de Gama liad, by the circumnaviga-

tion of Africa, sustained the honour of Portugal, which enterprising coimtry assumed

the lead in exploration, imtil Columbus achieved the feat that completely

--that lie liad discoA-ered would be able to defy the Old ! that upou the waves

which rocked the frail canoes, irou-clads would fly the stars and stripes, that a vast
nation of Christian men should spring from the new soil and people the desolate
wastes, that the wilderness should become a garden and the swamps luxuriant
cotton-tields, that great cities should arise upon the margin of her riAcrs, that the
slave should be rendered free, and that the electric spark should speak in the pro-

--foimd depths of the Atlantic and hold communication each minute with the West
    that weary distant West, to which for weeks and weeks he had struggled on
towards unknown shores, lost on a boundless ocean, but trusting in a Divine Guide

who watched over the human instrument that steered onwards on the grand path to

 civilization.

    In the short period of 380 years, a small fractional portion of the interval assigned

to the existence of man upon our earth, what vast changes have occiu'red, not only

in geographical discovery, but by its results ! America has become a giant, an
irresistible power upon her own soil, separated from Europe by an ocean that renders

her secure from hostile aggression. With every -^'ariety of climate, from the frigid

to the torrid zone, with fertile soil, boundless forests, navigable rivers of prodigious

extent, and commodious ports, the future of that wonderfid comitry may be pro-
gnosticated by a comparison with the past. The first steps of a young colony are

slow and fidl of difficulty but if in 380 years America has attained her present high
                                                                                                                                           ;

position from an utterly savage state, what part will that vast continent assume in
the futm-e history of the world ?

    If possible, more wonderful in rapid advancement than America is that extraor-

dinary country beneath our very feet. Australia is an instance affording a practical

result of that wide theory, that temperature and geographical position are the chan-

nels of civilization, and that according to the conditions of climate and the advan-

tages of a locality will be its degree in the scale of progress. Within the memory
of many who are here present, the now important cities of Australia were mere buds
upon the family tree of colonies. Blessed with the favourable conditions of tem-
perature and geographical position, they have burst suddenly into bloom. Not only
have we that vast pyramid of gold exposed in the Paris Exhibition as proof of the
value of Australia, l^ut we possess a more lasting testimony of the importance of

that fifth section of the globe in the imports of tcool of the finest quality. This is

the most oomplete proof of success, as the locality most favouraljle to the fine-wool-
bearing species of sheep is that most specially adapted for the European races of

mankind.

  We haAe thus two grand examples before us of the energy and vitality of the

Anglo-Saxon race. Great Britain, that at the time of the lioman conquest was an
island of half-naked savages, whose explorations were confined to coasting their
own shores in hide and wicker-work canoes, has in the com'se of ages fullilled her
great destiny, and is become the parent of the East and West. Australia and
^\merica are the two huge children of the old mother, grand offsprings from which
must flow the soiu'ces of civilization.

   But in the moment of triumph, when Ave regard these mighty results of geogra-

phical enterprise with pride and satisfaction, geography, that all-important

--science which Ave have now the honom- to represent, whispers this warning in our

ears '' That as aa-c have peopled distant lands, and nursed these infants imtil they
have become great, the mother should no longer hold them in the leading-strings
of childhood, but that, as stahvart sons groAvn into manhood launch independently
upon the Avorld, so should our great offsprin:-s, Canada and Australia, regard the old
mother with affection, but assume their position of independence." Geographj^ is
the base of diplomacy. There are things difhcult, but possible but there are ob-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

stacles of Xature that are impossible to overcome. The Atlantic declares the inde-
pendence of Canada, as no support could be afforded by Great Britain in a contest

Avith America.
   It is natural to our insular position that geographical science should be more

deeply appreciated in Eno-land than in other coimtries. Our strength lies in our
commercial enterprise. Our commerce depends upon our colonies ; these encircle
the Avorid. Thus geographical knoAvledge must be an important element in Eng-
lish education, as hardly a family exists in the United Kingdoni that is not repre-
sented by one or more of its members either in India or the colonies.
108 REPORT--1867.

   There are at the present day important questions connected with our Indian pos-
sessions that demand the vigorous attention of English geogTajjhers. It is a curious

fact that all the great nautical discoveries of tlie -world were achieved before the

power of steam had rendered the sailor independent of wind and tide : hut with the

peculiar aid of rapid locomotion the mind of man is not content -u-ith ancient beaten

paths, but seeks to lessen the distance of remote countries by adopting new and
direct means of communication. It appears to many of us as the aftair of yesterday

that the overland route to India was established by the indefatigable Waghoni

(whose name should ever be held in honour) ; but in the short space of about fifteen
years the camel has ceased to be the " ship of the desert " upon the Isthmus of
Suez ; a railroad connects the Eed Sea with the Mediterranean, a canal already

conveys the sweet waters of the Nile through deserts of arid sand to Suez, and a

fleet of superb transports upon the lied Sea conveys our troops direct to India.

Who can predict the future ? who can declare the great French work to be im-

possible, and deny that within the next half-century the fleets of the Mediterrauean

will sail through the Isthmus of Suez upon the Lesseps Canal ?

England has been the first to direct to general use the power of steam. Our vessels

were the first to cross the Atlantic, and to round the stormy Cape to India. The

name of Stephenson will live for ever as the in^·entor of the railway, and that of

Wheatstone as the adaptor of electricity to the telegraph ; but, proud as we may be

of these great inventions which by the reduction of space bring distant countries
into close communication and tend to civilization, have we not thus destroyed the

spell that kept our shores inviolate ? Not only ourselves, but the French also

Wepossess a magnificent line of transports upon the Red Sea.    can no longer

match the dexterity of our sailors against o^erwhelming odds. Steam breaks the

chann ! ^^'ars are the aftair of weeks or days ; there are no longer the slow marches

that rendered inaccessible far-distant points ; the railwa}' alters the former conditions

of all countries.

   Without yielding to exaggerated alarm, we must watch with intense attention

the advances of Russia upon the Indian frontier ; and beyond all geogTaphical enter-

prises we should devote extreme interest to a new and direct route to India by the

Euphrates Valley and the Persian Gulf, thus to be independent of complications

that might arise with Egypt  Thanks to the devotion and zeal ot the dis-

tinguished President, Sh Roderick Murchison, the Roj'al Geographical Society has

of late years received so great an impulse that it comprises at this moment 2130

Members ; there is no exploration of any importance that can be undertaken through-

out the world without the knowledge and the attention of this Society. Thus not

only are we forewarned of the encroachments of neighbouring powers, should their
expeditions be pushed beyond the limits of necessity, but we form a nucleus for all

geographical information, shovdd the Government resort to us in an emergency.

Free from all jealousy and above suspicion, we have this year awarded to the

Russian Admiral, Boutakoflj the Founder's Gold Medal, for having been the first to

launch a steanun- on the Sea of ^Vi-al, and to conduct his vessel upwards of 1000

miles along the course of the river Jaxartcs.

   The Victoria Gold Jledal has been conferred upon that eminent Arctic A'oyager,
Dr. Isaac Hayes, who bj- reaching the highest northern latitude hitherto attained

(81° 35'), in his arduous voyage towards the open Polar Sea, has nobly sustained the

honour of America. Thus the year 1807 aflbrds au interesting proof of the unpre-

iudiced patronage of the Society, as botli the Foiuuler's aiul the Patron's Medals

have been bestowed upon these distinguished foreigners.

myIt is not  intention to enter into the details of the geographical explorations

of the past year, that have been so ably enlarged upon by Sir Roderick Murchison

in the exhaustive review contained in his annual address of May 27th ; but it is
my duty to bring to your notice those most important geographical facts which,

from their recent occurrence, claim our present attention. lu Africa, we have to
record the noble expedition of Mr. Gerhard Rohlf, who has safely returned from his

remarkable journey across the Sahara from Tripoli, via Cthadames and Murzuk, to

Kuka, on the shores of Lake Tchad ; thence south to Benue, down that stream to

its junction with the Niger, and then acro.^s by Innd to Lagos in the Bight of Benin.

In Abyssinia we fire about to commence a military expedition, to which we trust

Her Majesty's Government will attach a staff" of men of science that may return

mth valuable results. The importance of exploratious was never more fundblv

exemplified than in the present instance, when a war is about to commence in a
wild country of which the military authorities are utterly ignorant, and solelv de-
pendent upon the accounts of private travellers. In Asia, we have to remark 'uidou

the extraordinary progress by the Russians in geograpliical enterprize, who by their
settlements in Manchm-ia and explorations of the Khiuka Lake, and the navio-able

rivers Usuri and Anioor, are laying the foundations for the future development of

that hitherto neglected portion of the world. When we regard the vigorous steps

that have been adopted by Eussia in Northern iVsia, we turn with increased atten-

tion to the energetic appeal of General Sir Arthur Cotton for an exploration of that

unknown land between the Burhampooter and the Yang-tze, with a view to open

a free communication between India, with its 200 millions, and China, with its 400

millions of inhabitants. In America we devote increased attention to inter-oceanic

communication across the Isthmus, upon which interesting subject papers will be

read before this Association by Lieutenant Oliver, on a recent exploration of a new

route across Nicaragua, under the direction of that well-known and enero-etic ex-
plorer, Captain Bedford Pirn.

No striking geographical feat has been performed by England during the present

year ; but the anxiety not only of geographers but of Englishmen of^'all classes is

--painfully keen upon a subject of uni-^ersal interest the reported death of Dr.
Livingstone. It is well known that this eminent traveller was engaged in an

important exploration, with the intention of determining the watershed of Eastern

equatorial Africa. His object was to prove by actual inspection whether the

Nj'assa, from which the Shire flows to the Zambesi, was fed by a river from the

north                              he was then to  reach  the Tanganika Lake of Burton and Speke, and prove

northern extremity, and prove whether it was fed by a river fronAhe north, or

whether it communicated with the Albert N'yanza. With this gTeat iournev

before him. Dr. Livingstone had reached and crossed over the northern portion of

the Nyassa, which appears to have been so shallow that the canoes were poled

across a sandy bed ; this would suggest the existence of some tributary of the

northern extremity of the lake that in annual floods had brouo-ht down the

deposit.

   Upon arrival on the western shore, he found himself in the hostile country of
the Mazite, and during the march, a few days later, the party was suddenly

attacked and overpowered.

By the report of nine Johanna men and their leader, Moosa, who, after great diffi-

culties, returned to Zanzibar, it appears that Livingstone killed two of his'^issailants

but was himself struck down by the blow of an axe on the back of the neck!
Moosa and the Johanna men had concealed themselves in a thicket, but after dark

they ventured to the scene of the recent conflict, and discovered the body of Liv-
ingstone with those of several of their own party and two of the enemy. They
scraped a hole in the earth and buried the body of our lamented traveller.

This happened in about August 1866; we have therefore been twelve montlis

without further tidings. There are some persons (among others, my hio-hly

honoured and much-loved friend Sir Roderick Murchison) who still cling tortile

hope that Livingstone is alive, and that the story of the Johanna men is false and
merely a lame excuse for the desertion of tiieir master.                                                                              '

  The fate of Livinostoue, our common friend, of whom we are all justly proud, is
so intensely interesting, that I may be excused for expressing my gloomy opinion :

I believe him to be dead.

   Those who still hope, cling to the fact that the Johanna men are renowned as

liars, and that they have trumped up a story to excuse their return. It is this very

fact of their power of consummate lying that convinces me of the substantial truth

of their statement. Natives are scientific liars ; they do not lie absurdly, like Euro-
peans, but they concoct their falsehoods with such forethought, that the lie itself is

an example of profound skill. No native, that I have ever seen, would commit him-

self to so inartistic a lie as to declare to be dead a man who is still alive, who would

become a witness at a future time against him. Shoidd natives intend to desert
                                                                                                            :;

their master, they invariably plead excuses that cannot he proved to be false, such as

sickness, or pretended lameness, that incapacitates them from mra-ching ; but the
hardihood of the Johanna men in committing themselves, by the confession of their

cowardice, is a surprising instance of veracity that could only have been prompted
by the urgency of the calamity. To confess the death of the master is the
extreme of moral courage, as a native woidd di-ead the suspicion that might fall
upon him as the murderer ; therefore the story of poor Livingstone's murder,
although diifering in details, as described to various people by ^Mooc-a, I thoroughly

believe to be substantially correct ; and this belief, I regret to say, is shared by

Dr. Kirk, our Vice-Consul at Zanzibar, who was Livingstone's former companion on

the expedition to the Nyassa.

   With, this sad conviction that Livingstone has passed away for ever, and that
his bones now lie beneath that fatal soil of Africa that has been his glorious stage,

--I can only, as a fellow traveller in the rough path of African research, exclaim

· " Peace to his memory ! honour to those remains that moulder in the dust, a
sacrifice to philanthropy in that distant and hopeless field, where the hand of

friendship is s]uirned, and where a min-derous stab is the reward for Christian
enterprise ! " There is no stone to mark the spot where the gi-eat traveller lies

but as a gallant sailor's corpse is given to the waves, and rests in death within the

element with which in life he struggled, so rests the body of our tired pilgrim,
covered with the soil of jVfiica, as with a flag that enfolded him in victory. His

name will never die, but, deeply gra^·en on the hearts of all mankind, it will descend

in history.

   Awl now, before I close this address, I must refer with pride and satisfaction to the

vigour aud alacritj' that has been exhibited, not only by the Eoyal Geographical

Society, at the earnest instance of our sterling President, Sir Eoderick Murchison,

but also by Her Majesty's Government, in despatchiug, without a moment's unne-

cessary delay, an expedition to Eastern Africa to investigate the fate of Living-

stone. Should he be no more, the arrival of an armed expedition in his search

will be a lesson to the savage tribes that no Englishman can disappear without an

inquiry into  the  cause                             and  good service will be done  to  geography bj' the  party
                                                  ;

under Mr. Young, who, provided with a steel boat, vrill be able to decide whether

the Nj-assa is fed by a river from the north.

   The most interesting African proldem yet remains to be solved. Within the
last few years we have determined the great reservoirs of the Nile, and we have

proved that the river, hitherto so mysterious, is the oft'spriug of two great

--causes the vast equatorial reservoirs the Victoria and Albert Lakes, and the

sudden rains of Abyssinia that in July, August, and September cause the

inundation in Lower Egypt : that jiortion of the question I shall shortly pub-

lish as tlie ' Nile Tributaries of Abyssinia.' But although the mystery of ages is

Wesolved, much remains to be explored.                    Imow but a portion of those immense

reservoirs ; and geogTaphers will not remain content with the bare fact that the

Nile issues from those  lalces                            but England,  that has  untied the knot, must gather
                                                      ;

in the extremity of the line. The death of Livingstone is a fearful drag upon the

wheel of African exploration. There are many as brave, many as adventiu-ous ; but

there are few who conrbine the qiualifications of patience and endurance that are

so sorel}' needed in that most difficult of all thorny paths, " African research."

Still we must not despair : we have of late years acquired an ally that is the grand

supporter of geographical exploration, a svipporter that assists us through paths

that were closed before the providential aid appeared ; and in those swamps whose

fat.al malaria slew with infernal certainty the brave aud daring explorers of former

times, quinine is the guard and faithful escort of the traveller. Anned with this
cuirass, we can penetrate through countiies hitherto impassable. The advancement

of science has so far practically augmented the power to civilize, that, with drugs

hitherto unknown, conveniences that preserve the traveller from the vicissitudes of

climate, such as waterproofs &c. &c., fire-arms of deadly precision, astronomical

instruments, steel and india-rubber boats of infinite variety, not only can we push
through obstacles that were formerly insurmountable, but we can return with

scientific results, and leave behind us in those savage countries a path and intro-

duction for future travellers.

   But even wlieu these facilities are absent, there is one great quality that, if life
remains, may overcome all difficulties, a quality for -^vhich, I trust, Great Britain
·will ever be' renowned " determination.'' "When we met Speke and Grant (the
Englishman and the Scotchman) at Gondokoro, they had nothing except guns,
ammunition, beds, and quinine ; and still they Jiad overcome all difficulties.

When my wife and I returned two years later to the same spot, we had had

no quinine for eighteen months, our steel boat had been our large sponging-

batli, our india-rubber floats had been infated goafsJn'ns ; and nevertheless we

are here now, thanks to the guidance of a Divine Providence
   But, next to Providence, there is a support to which an English traveller clings

when far, far away from civilization, in countries unkno-^^ni and trackless. He may
be in misery and "helpless, he may have lost all hope of return, and sickness may

have stricken him to the margin of his grave ; but as his last thoughts wander

--towards all those left behind, and he weighs the fatal end against the residts of his

mission, of one thing he feels certain : His Government may ignore him, friends

may forget him, but the Royal Geographical Society, with Murchison at the head,
will never forsake him ; if dead, he will be sought for ; and should he retiu-n alive,

their approbation of his labours will be his great reward.

    Confident in this support, the hardy pioneers of Great Britain will floclf to the

thinned ranlcs of the explorers. Speke lies buried in his native village-church

Li^-ingstone, we fear, lies far away ; but the monument we raise to these brave
men will be the starting-]3oint for others, who may equal their great deeds. And

should the traveller fall in the noble task, and die in a lonely and distant land, if

no friendh' voice be near to bid farewell, he still will have a consolation : in the

last hour, a spirit will whisper these words of comfort to his soid, *' England

expects that every man will do his duty ! "

Notes of a Hecomiatssance of some Portions of Palestine ynade in 1865-66 /or

          the Palestine Exploration Fund. By Lieut. Andeesok, R.E.

The reconnaissance survey commenced at Baneas, near the source of the most

important tributary of the Jordan. The Latitude was carefully fixed, the position

of the junction of the Jordan and Baneas streams determined, and the places con-

Anected by compass-bearings.  base was thus obtained on which to frame the

triangulation to the mountains on both sides of the valley. From Baneas an azi-

muth line was observed to a prominent peak about ten miles distant on the west

side of the valley, and the latitvide of the survey camp at the village of Hunin,

near the peak, determined. From Hunin the watershed was followed, which for

topographical reconnaissance afforded great facilities, as a clear view was always

obtained to great distances east and west, and all impoi-tant places visible within

eight or ten miles were fixed by triangulation. The next camp was fixed at Kedes,

and connected with that of Hunin by an azimuth line. The suney then removed

to the village of ^ilma, overlooking the lake of Huleh, eighteen miles distant

from Baneas, and the line of azimuths connected hence with the watershed of

Kefr Birim. Explorations were made to the north, twelve or fifteen miles, and all

mountain-tops and villages vs-ithin access visited and surveyed. To the south of

Kefr Birim the culminating highlands of Upper Galilee, which had never been

previously examined, were thoroughly explored. From Jebel Jurmuk, about 4000

feet above the sea-level. Cape Carmel could be distinctly seen. The next camp

was pitched at Safed. Safed Castle has a most extensive view in eveiy direction,

Aexcept nortli-east, where a hill 200 feet higher intervenes.  triangidation and

siuTcy of the whole of the Sea of Galilee and adjoiningmountains was ne.xtmade.

The reconnaissance was extended about eight miles to the westward to the village

of Ailahoon, and proceeding southward, embraced tlie country over which the

Crusaders made their disastrous march from Sepphoris to Kurn Hattin. From

Nazareth Wely a \-iew was obtained over the beautiful plain of Esdraelon, and ob-

servations made to many points, including others to Mount Ebal, thirty-five miles

further south. As far south as Jeuin the watershed was explored and mapped out

to the bend of the Leontes, about sixty miles distant in a straight line. The

watershed to the eastward of Nablus had not yet been explored by any traveller.

112 KEPORT--1867.

The survey of the vratershed was commeuced agahi a little north of Mount Ebal,
and explored continuousl}- as far as Jerusalem, which is situated itself on the
main watershed of the country. The reconnaissance was extended through the
Bedouin country to the Jordan, and the much-disputed position of Jisr Damieh
connected with the sites previously fixed. The country to the eastward of Nablus
was visited and mapped ; Jehel Azur, Mount Gerizim, Mount Ebal, and Ivurn Tur-
tabeh were also connected with the survey; and it was finally protracted to Jatla,
thus establishing a connexion between this place and Baueas.

0)1 the Lar/oons of Corsica. Bt/ Prof. D. T. Ansted, F.R.S.

The eastern coast of Corsica is the most malarious district in the Mediterranean

but this has only been the case within the historic period. 2000 years ago there

was a defensible town on the coast called Aleria, and V20 years later a Roman

colony was established there, the seat of a large trade. This continued and the
coast was inhabited till the [Middle Ages, when the pirates of the Mediterranean

forced the inhabitants back into the hills. In the early part of the sixteenth cen-

tury the plains ceased to be habitable, and they have never since been without

deadly malaria in the summer. Mariana, another ancient and mediajval colony

near the lagoon of Biguglia, had also been deserted. To the north of the sites of

both these ancient towns extends a lagoon, formerly, in all probability, an open

bay. The fine sand and mud of the rivers and watercourses are carried towards

the north, and form a bar or wall of sand in advance of the coast. Behind this bar,

--wherever there are torrents between the rivers, a pool or lagoon is formed these

ton-ents not being able to keep open a channel to the sea. But a communication
must be kept up, partly to enable the surplus waters to escape to the ocean dui-ing

winter, and partly to admit the sea to the pool when, during summer, the contents

are evaporated. Meanwhile all the organic matter brought down by the torrents

is retamed in the lagoon, decomposes there, and is converted into miasmatic

vapour. So long as there is free communication to the sea there is no malaria
but when the lagoon is formed malaria sets in. The lagoon of Biguglia extends

8 miles towards the north : its greatest width is about lA mile. The wall or bank

separating the lagoon from the sea is from 900 to 400 yards wide, and its height

is about 9 feet above the level of the Mediterranean. There are two cuts, which

are now filled up. The deepest part of the lagoon is 10 feet, and much of it
is not more than -3 feet. The water is nearly fresh in winter, and everywhere
brackish in sunmier. The lagoon receives the di-ainagc of 45,000 acres, and con-
tains itself 4800 acres. The quantity of rain averages 24 inches per annum, of
which 6 inches fall in November and 4 inches in October. More tlmn 2 inches

has fallen in 24 hours, nearly 4 inches in a week, and about 12 inches in 4 weeks.

From a consideration of these measurements, it is evident that the lagoon might
rise (3 inches in 24 hours, and as much as 3 feet in a month, if it were not for the

outlet to the sea : a channel will thus always be kept open. 2000 years ago the

mud and sand of the Golo had not formed a bar in front of the bay, the shore of

which was within the inner shore of the lagoon. There was no effectual barrier

preventing the waters of the torrents reaching the sea until three centuries ago.

Thus within 1700 years there has been commenced and completed a bank of sand

--7 miles in length, a quarter of a mile wide, and about lo feet high the result of

two rivers, the Golo and the Be^inco. The deposit is equivalent to about 75

grains of solid matter deposited on an average by each gallon of water. There is

no evidence of any elevation of land within the recent or historic period that can

explain the change that has taken place. It is evident that the lagoon has been

formed by the accumulated sands and mud, and that the malaria is due to the

closing of the lagoon. It is in the highest degree desirable that these lagoons

should be got rid of or rendered innocuous. This can be done, in the lagoon of

Biguglia, by separating the area into two unequal parts. The larger area might be

drained by pumping, at a moderate cost, and kept dry by the same machinery

occasionally used                                                                   part of the  smaller  area  might be  converted  into the  channel
                                                                                 ;

of the Bevmco, and the rest drained by inexpensive machinery. The redeemed

lands would be of great value; but the' principal result would "be felt in the im-

provement of the sanitary state of the adjoining districts. The experience of Mr.
J3ateman in Minorca seems to prove that malaria may be removed by the drainage
of lagoons, and the surrounding population raised thereby from their present state
of apathy and stagnation.

               On Walvisch Bay and the Ports of South- West Africa.

                                   B)j Thomas Baines, F.E.G.S.

   The importance of Walvisch Bay is due to its being the best harbour on this part

of the Afiican coast, and to the existence of mines of copper in the neighbouring
interior. It lies in lat. 22° 27' S., and comprises the estuary of the Kiusip river,
where there is well-sheltered anchorage for vessels of almost any size. So arid
and sandy is the climate, that the river contains water only during a few weeks of
the rainy season, and fresh water for consumption is obtained bj' rolling casks from
Sand Fountain, four miles distant. The country in the vicinity is peopled by

Namaqua Hottentots and Damaras. The value of British imports one year
amounted to £2oO,(X)0, and the author advocated the establishment of a com-

missioner in the port, authorized to hoist the British flag, regulate the commerce
of the place, and settle questions that arise between the traders and the nati^'es.
The country abounds with cattle, which might become objects of a large export
trade. The copper found is a rich heavy ore, greenish or dark pm-ple ; but some-
times bolts of pure native copper are met with. 6285 tons of copper were shipped

during the month of May 1867.

Exploration of Beloochistan and Western Scinde, with a vieiv to eaxcimninff the

             Subterranean Supjyly of Water. By J. W. Baenes.

The author commenced his operations at a place about eight miles north-east of

Kuri'achee, where, after some weeks' laboiu", he succeeded in piercing the first
water-bearing strata, when the water rushed up and overflowed the smface, con-

tiniung, without intermission, to the present time. Water was obtained at other

places in the arid country, and springs were visited which are from 00 to 300 feet

above the valleys. With this evidence of subterranean water, we are boimd to

inquire where is the source. Originally, of course, it is derived from rain or snow.

The desert country of Scinde is often spoken of as destitute of rain. The rainfall

averages, indeed, only 4 inches per annum                                                                                                                                                                                                 but if we glance at a map of Asia, we

observe, between the eastern borders of Persia and the western boundary of the

Scinde and Punjab valleys, a tract of country 8-30,000 square miles in extent, with

a mountainous and humid area, from 3000 to 12,000 feet above the sea-level, from

which a considerable subterraneous supply of water must be derived. Granting an

average annual rainfall of 3-7o inches over this area, and as we know that in every

coxmtry a portion of the rainfall, estimated from one-third to one-twelfth, perco-
lates and is absorbed by the permeable strata, there is room for a strong inference

that a vast body of water is available over the whole of the region, between the

thirtieth parallel of latitude and the Indian Ocean. It is recorded by navigators

that large springs of fresh water burst up through the sea in the neighbourhood of

Cape Ormuz.  The    formation of this part is, undoubtedly, tertiary                                                                                                                                                                                                                  and the  stra-

He also entered particularly into the characteristics of the native population, their

occupation, characters, and general economy.

On the Coasts of Vancouver's Island, British Columbia, and Russian America.
                                   By P. N. CoMPTON.

   The author described the physical outlines of the coast-region of these countries,
visited by him during eight years' service in the Hudson's Bay Company, at Van-
couver's Island. The most marked featiu-e, between the straits of De Fuca and the

fifty-ninth parallel of latitude, is the numerous long inlets in the rocky precipitous
coasts. They run generally in a north-easterly direction, and vaiy in length from
thirty to seventy miles. The sceneiy in most of these inlets is grand in the ex-
treme : evei-y few miles cascades of water leap down the lofty, rocky sides, pro-
ceeding from the melting snows of the peaks that tower up a short distance in the

interior. An enumeration of these inlets was given, together with a more detailed

description of several of them. It is a cm-ious feature that none of the large
rivers of these countries discharge themselves into these deep inlets. Lynn's

canal, in Russian America, has large glaciers in its valleys, extending to the sea-

shore, from which they are separated sometimes only by a belt of trees. The
climate here is very severe ; and the author has seen, in the month of May, 4 feet
of snow close to the sea-level. This inlet is one of the longest on the coast, ex-
tending inland about seventy miles ; but it averages only about two miles in width.
The cl.mate of Russian America is extremely severe ; it is doubtful if any crop
but potatoes could be raised on its poor soil, and the amoimt of available land is

very limited.  ______^^

   Considerations were adduced by the author of this paper in support of the view
 hat the period embraced by architectural and other records of the most ancient
nations forms but a small portion of the time that has elapsed since man's lirst
appearance on the earth. From the time in which he acquired the skill to frame

such records, we have to trace him back, over the manj' stages he had to pass

through, up to the discovery of his remains in caves, and even of those of his
handiwork in the most recent geological formation, the " drift." The localities,
moreover, wliich were favourable to the development of a people sufficiently ad-
vanced to produce enduring records of their existence are few in number. To trace

man's existence up to its earliest date, according to the author's view, we must go
beyond this, to the time wlien he was without speech, ignorant of every art, and,

like the lower animals, chiefly guided by instinct.

   Arabia, from one extremity to another, is inhabited by a single race of man,

--apparently its aborigines. The physical geogi-aphy of their country must have eaily

divided the Arabs into two usually distinct classes the nomadic shepherds fori he

desert, and the fixed agriculturists for the less sterile part of the country. Had the
people of Arabia been African negroes, or Malays, or even Hindoos, we may safely

 believe that in their inhospitable land they would never have attained even the
modest measure of advancement they have exhibited, but, on the contrary, would
have remained in the savage condition of some Africans, or Red Indians, whose
condition was far more auspicious. But the Arab is of higher intellectual quality
than any other race of Asia, in many respects not being surpassed even by the
 Chinese ; and this superiority is evinced by the predominance they exercise when
they come into contact with any of the other races of Asia. At some very remote
and unknown time, a settlement of Arabs took place in the neighbouring country
of Syria, the evidence of whch is the existence in Hebrew of many Arabic words.
With this obscure exception, the long isolation of the Arabs continued down to
the time of Mohammed. Under the inspiration of the religion of their prophet,
they left their own country, and at once commenced a career of conquest which,

for rapidity, durability, and extent has no parallel. Transplanted to better lands
than their own, the Arabs appear to have improved or fallen oft", chiefly in propor-
tion to the quality of the race with which they commingled. They became deterio-

rated amongst the Syrians and Egyptians, and their greatest social advancement

was, probably, when they came into contact with a European people in the
Spanish peninsula. It was in foreign countries only that they made advance in

civilization. Their literature and their architecture all sprang up in foreign coun-
tries. They were not themselves discoverers or inventors, and the benefit they
conferred on mankind consisted only in their being the agents through which the

discoveries and improvements of other nations were widely disseminated. It was,

for example, through their active mediation that the arts of distillation and paper-
making (Chinese inventions) reached Europe ; and the western world owes to them

the introduction of many useful plants, as rice, cotton, the sugar-cane, the opium-
Sioppy, the orange, and the melon. The number of Arabic words introduced into
 breign languages varies with the influence exercised by the religion of the Arabs,
and the capacity of the people to comprehend it. The language has nowhere but in
Syria, Egypt, and Barbary made any approach to the supercession of the native

idioms of countries conquered by the Arabs. The great disparity which existed

between the manners, habits, and pronunciation of a European and an Asiatic
people made the number of Arabic words introduced into the Spanish language

comparatively inconsiderable, and their corruption great, although the power of
the Arabs in the Spanish peninsula endured, from first to last, 778 years.

On the Character of the Negro, chiefly in relation to Industrial Habits.
                          By Dr. John Davy, F.B.S.

In this paper the chief object of its author was the vindication of the Negro,

who, he believes, has been unjustly considered a sluggard and inveterately idle.

The argument used is  of two kinds                                                    one is  founded on the organization of the
                                                                                   ;

African, excellently fitted for work, indeed the very cause, under a mistaken

hum.anity, of his first importation into the West Indies, with the vain hope of

preserving the feebler and cruelly worked natives.

The other (resting on experience), a very extensive experience, proving that

with equal motives to be industrious, the negro is not inferior to the white man

in industry.

The author adduces instances of conduct on the part of negro labourers that

would be highly creditable to Eui-opeans in the same condition of life.

  He concludes with the expression of belief that such peculiarities as belong to

the negi'o, as colour of skin, quality of hair, kc, are of a kind suitable to him

in his native climate, and beneficial under a tropical sun and in a malarious

atmosphere, and not of a natm-e to allow of his being considered either as a

distinct or inferior variety of the great human family. And further, that he is as

capable as the white man, under continued education, in favourable circumstances,

and freed from the cm-se of slavery, of becoming civilized, and of making pro-

gress in the liberal arts and sciences. One fact is dwelt on as of a very promising

kind, viz. that those tribes in the far interior, mountainous regions of Africa,

most advanced, probably as much so in civilization and the useful arts, such as

the working of iron &c., as were the ancient Britons about the time of the first

Roman invasion.

            On Exploration in Palestine. By Cybil Gkaham, F.R.G.S.

An Association was formed two years ago for the purpose of exhaustively ex-

ploring the Holy Land. The first announcement of its object was met by surprise,
that such a work had still to be executed. Had not the scores of travellers, it was
asked, who annually traverse Palestine, brought all the information that could be

desired ? But ninety -nine out of every hundred of these rigidly follow the same

track, and huiTy home without adding an atom to our knowledge.

   What is proposed, in the first place, is a trigonometrical sm-vey on a large scale,
in which every village and every mound which marks the site of what once was a

village, eveiy glen, eveiy scar, every spring, every feature, be it ever so small, of

presumptive importance shall be delineated.

  'i'hen we wish to know the materials of which old Hermon and the Lebanon are

composed ; the fossil remains of ancient creatures imbedded in their sides ; the na-
ture of the soils; all the trees of the mountains; all the flowers of the plains which

cover the land as a carpet in the spring of the year ; all the fishes of the Sea of

WeTiberias
                                       ;
            all the phenomena of that most remarkable of basins the Dead Sea.

--want, too, a catalogue of the bea.sts and reptiles, in which the crocodile will appear,
   of the birds, of the butterflies, of the beetles, and the smaller entities of creation,

in all their varieties. In short, we want that book rewritten, which has not been

ti-ansmitted to this day, composed by a master of science 3000 years ago, which

treated of plants, from the hyssop that is on the housetop to the cedar that is upon

Lebanon, and of the birds, and the beasts, and the creeping things, and the fishes of

that land.

   Again, if we turn towards the East, to the other side of Jordan, there is seen a

--spacious field for future labour, Moab, barren and wild ; Gilead, with its forests,

and Bashan, with its cities walled and unwalled, from which the Children of Israel,

by divine help, expelled the Eephaim. Edrei and Salcah were the limits of Og's

kingdom.- Edrei, entrenched in a labyrinth of rocks, is a stronghold which would

stiU task the unaided arm of man to conquer ; the castle of Salcah on the southern-

most spm- of tlie diills of Bashan commands to this day the approach to the old

kingdom from the east, and the descendants of the Oaks, which excited the admira-

tion of the sacred writers, have never ceased to cling to the range which their

ancestors adorned.

In the heai't of Bashan lies Argob, that curiosity of geology, a mass of once

molten matter, tossed and torn and twisted and upheaved, resembling more nearly

the appearance of the moon, as revealed to us by Lord Rosse's telescope, than a

condition of things on the earth.

Beyond the mountains winch form the barrier of Bashan, a duplicate occurs of

this woj'k of the convulsion of nature, and gToups of towns, scattered over the plain,

these many ages desert and desolate, remain as monuments of the proficiency in

more than one art of a very early period.

   The author in conclusion said, " I feel that this great congress, which has met to
consider the modes in which human research may be best conducted, will hardly
require of me an apology for introducing to it, and begging for it the right hand of

fellowship, an Association which proposes to confer, and which, if the means be

granted, will confer such a benefit on so many branches of knowledge.

  We" have no section for archseology, no section for history, no section for theo-

--object that we have in view a light will be throv.-n upon the birthplace of our

faith, upon the configuration and the products of the ctiuntiy, and the way of living

of a people far dift'erent from ourselves, enabling us to read with a more vivid in-

terest, and a more real intelligence, the scenes so gi-aphically depicted in the Scrip-

tures."

            On some Changes of Surface affecting Ancient Ethnography*.
                                By H. H. HowoRTH.

    In this paper the author claimed to prove that the accounts given by Pliny and

 the other Koman geographers, of the physical conformation of Scandinavia, namely,

 that it was then an archipelago of large islands, has been abundantly sustained by
 the evidence collected by Swedish observers since the seventeenth century, by the
minute inspection madeiu 1833 by Sir Charles Lyell, and by subsequent investiga-
 tions, which evidence is to the effect that the whole of the land north and north-
 east of Stockholm is rising rapidly, and that the Baltic is becoming more limited

in area every day. This area of elevation has been extended by many observers

into Central Asia, where the Caspian within the historic period has receded enor-
mously, the former conjunction with it of the sea of Aral being only a very limited

index "of this depletion. From these facts the author deduced the conclusions,

    First, that the rhetorical expression of '' the northern hive " is more than ever

an exaggeration, and that we must look elsewhere for the cradle of the great ma-
jority of invading peoples who overturned the Roman empire.

    Secondly, that the tilling up of a large area in Southern and Centi-al Asia with
sea and marsh in ancient times must affect the positions of its races as given in
orthodox geographies, and oflers a suggestive field for those who, like himself, are
interested in the causes of the continuity and the idicsyncracies of the Indo-

European family.

            On the Origines of the Norsemen. By H. H. HowoRTHf.

   The author held the view of Hallam and others to be imtenable, namely, that
the sudden eruption of Norsemen into western Europe, and their ferocity, were
due to the Saxon wars of Charlemagne, which sent many of the chieis of that race
beyond the limits of Germany, and in revenge of which they afterwards returned
to be the scourge of all Europe. The only explanation of the many peculiarities of
the Norsemen is to be found in the fact of their having been but late immigrants
into the area whence they emerged so powerfully and so suddenly. Their own
traditions, their epics and war-songs contain no allusions to such a tempting and
suggestive subject as the wars of Charlemagne. After passing in review all that
could be found in classical wi-iters bearing on the subject, the author believed that
the balance of e%'idence was in favour of identifying the Norsemen with the Rox-
elani, literally " red-haired men," and that these were the same as the Sarmati,
who have been erroneously considered to be a Sclavonic nation.

 The Ethnography of the French Exhibition, as represented by National Arts.

                                  By Mrs. Lynn Linton.

   The author considered that, apart from all question of commercial value or
social gain, the Exhibition had at least one feature of undoubted importance,
namely, its ethnological material, which is singularly rich both in amount and
suggestiveness. Every variety of art is to be seen, from the rude works of the
savage, whose finest ideas are embodied in a necklace of shells, a mask of tattoo,
or a temple of skulls, through the intermediate grades of the semicivilized making
their first efforts, up to the latest productions of European skiU. The archaeo-
logical gallery of the Exhibition leads us by successive stages from the primitive

conditions of the lake-dwellers to the complex life of modem times. The work of

each nation, even in the department of jewellery, has a distinctive character of its
own, evidencing the peculiar habit of thought and intellectual status of the race.
The European, with all his science, cannot come near the exquisite grace of the
unlearned Hindu or the wandering Kurd. There is a strongly marked dissimi-
larity of intention in Eastern and Western work. There is no national life, no
public meaning in anything that comes from the East. It is all small and indi-

people. The West, on the contrary, shows its mechanical improvements and

grand scientific discoveries, planned to lessen the toil of labour and multiply its

this view in a very small and quite unimportant matter, valuable only as an indi-

--cation. Both West and East send models of their fruits, costimies, trades, &c.;

but the East sends them as toys mere playthings, which are made to amuse and

not to instruct ; while the models of the West are in aid of horticultural or

ethnographical science, the final cause of which is public good, not private

pleasure.

      On the Origin of Civilization and the Early Con'Jition of Man.
         By Sir John Lubbock, Bart., F.R.S., Pres. Ent. Soe. Sfc.

Side by side with the different opinions whether man constitutes one or many

species, there are two opposite views as to the primitive condition of the first men,

or first beings worthy to be so called. Many writers have considered that man was

at first a mere savage, and that our history has on the whole been a steady progress
towards civilization, though at times, and sometimes for centuries, some races

have been stationary, or even have retrograded. Other authors of no less eminence

have taken a diametrically opposite view. According to them, man was from the
commencement pretty much what he is at present. If possible, even more ignorant

of the arts and sciences than now, but with mental qualities not inferior to our own.

Savages they consider to be the degenerate descendants of far superior ancestors.

Of the recent supporters of this theory, the late Archbishop of Dublin was amongst

the most eminent. In the present memoir I propose briefly to examine the reasons

which led Dr. Whately to this conclusion, and still more briefly to notice some of

--the facts which seem to me to render it imtenable. Dr. Whately enunciates his

opinions in the following words : " That we have no reason to believe that any

community ever did, or ever can emerge, unassisted by external helps, from a state

of utter barbarism, into anj'thiug that can be called civilization  Man has not

emerged from the savage state ; the progress of any community in civilization, by its

own internal means, must .always have begim from a condition removed from that
of complete barbarism, out of which it does not appe.ar that men ever did or can

raise themselves." One might at first feel disposed to answer that fifty cases could

be cited which altogether discredit this assertion ; and vritbout going beyond the
limits of our own island, we might regard the history of England itself as a sufficient

answer to such a statement. Ai-chbishop Whately, however, was far too skilful a
debater not to have foreseen such an argument. " The ancient Germans," he says,

" who cultivated com, though their agriculture was probably in a vei-y rude state,

who not only had numerous herds of cattle, but emploj-ed the labour of brutes, and

even made use of cavalry in their wars, , . . these cannot with propriety be

reckoned savages, or if they are to be so called (for it is not worth while to dispute

about a word ), then I would admit that in this sense man may advance, and in
fact have advanced, by their own imassisted efforts, from the savage to the civi-

lized state." This limitation of the term " savage " to the very lowest repre-

sentatives of the human race no doubt rendered Dr. Whately 's theory more tenable

by increasing the difficulty of bringing forward conclusive evidence against it.

The Archbishop, indeed, expresses himself throughout his argument as if it would

be easy tn produce the required evidence in opposition to his theory, supposing that

any race of savages ever had raised themselves to a state of civilization. The

manner in which he has treated the case of the Mandaus, a tribe of North Ameri-

can Indians, however, effictually disposes of this hypothesis. This unfortunate

tribe is described as having been decidedly more civilized than those by which they

were sm-rounded. Having, then, no neighbom-s more advanced than themselves,

they were quoted as furnishing an instance of savages who had civilized them-

--selves without external aid. In answer to this, Ai-chbishop Whately asks " First,

How do we know that these Mandans were of the same race as their neighbours ?

HowSecondly,  do we know that theirs is not the original level from which the

other tribes have [alien ? Thirdly and lastly, supposing that the Mandans did
                                                                   --;

emerge from tte savage state, liow do we know that this may not have heen through

--the aid of some strangers coming among them like the Manco-Capac of Pern

from some more civilized country, perhaps long hefore the days of Colimihus ? "

Supposing, however, for a moment, and for the sake of argument, that the Man-

dans, or anj^ other race, were originally savages and had civilized themselves, it

would still be manifestly, from the very nature of the case, impossible to bring

forward the kind of evidence demanded by Dr. Whately. No doubt he " may con-

fidently aifirm that we find no one recorded instance of a tribe of savages, properly

so styled, rising into a civilized state without instruction and assistance from people

already civilized." Starting vsdth the proviso that savages, properly so styled, are

ignorant of letters, and laying it down as a condition that no ci^dlized example

should be placed before them, the existence of any such record is an impossibility

its very existence woidd destroy its value. In another passage Archbishop Whately

says, indeed, " If man generally, or some particular race, be capable of self-civi-

lization, in either case it may be expected that some record, or tradition, or monu-

ment, of the actual occurrence of such an event should be found." So far from

this, the existence of any such record would, according to the very hypothesis

Aitself, be impossible. Traditions are shortlived and untrustworthy. " monument"

which could prove the actual occuiTence of a race capable of self-civilization, I

confess myself unable to imagine. What kind of a monument would the Arch-

bishop accept as proving that the people which made it had been originally savage P

that they had raised themselves, and had never been influenced by strangers of a

superior race ? Evidently the word " monument " in the above passage was used

"Weonly to round ofi" the sentence. But, says Archbishop Whately,  have ac-

counts of various savage tribes, in different parts of the globe, who have been

visited from time to time at considerable inters^als, but have had no settled inter-

course with civilized people, and who appear to continue, as far as can be ascer-

tained, in the same uncultivated condition;" and he adduces one case, that of the

New Zealanders, who " seem to have been in quite as advanced a state when Tasman

discovered the country in 1642, as they were when Cook visited it 127 years after."

We have been accustomed to see around us an improvement so rapid that we

forget how short a period a centm-y is in the history of the human race. Even

taking the ordinary chronology, it is evident that if in 6000 years a given race has

only progressed from a state of utter savagery to the condition of the Australian,

we could not expect to find much change in one more century. Many a fishing

village, even on our own coast, is in veiy neai'lj- the same condition as it was 127

years ago. Moreover, I might fairly answer that according to Whately's own de-

finition of a savage state the New Zealanders woidd certainly be excluded. They

cultivated the ground, they had domestic animals, they constructed elaborate for-

tifications, and made excellent canoes, and were certainly not in a state of utter

barbarism. Or I might argue that a short visit, like that of Tasman, could give little

insight into the true condition of a people. I am, however, the less disposed to

question the statement made by Archbishop Whately, because the fact that many
races are now practically stationary is in reality an argument against the theory of

degradation and not against that of progress. Civilized races, say we, are the de-

scendants of races which have risen from a state of barbarism. On the contrarv,

argue our opponents, savages are the descendants of civilized races, and have sunk

to their present condition. But Archbishop Whately admits that the civilized
races are still rising, while the savages are now stationary ; and, oddly enough,

seems to regard this as an argument in support of the very untenable proposition,

that the difference between the two is due not to the progress of the one set of

races, a progress which every one admits, but to the degradation of those whom he

himself maintains to be stationaiy. The delusion is natural, and like that which

every one must have sometimes experienced in looking out of a train in motion,

when the woods and fields seem to be flying from us, whereas we know that in
reality we are moving and they are stationary. But it is argued, " If man,

when first created, was left, like the brutes, to the unaided exercise of those

natural powers of body and mind which are common to the European and to the

New Hollander, how comes it that the European is not now in the condition of
the New Hollander? " I am indeed stii-prised at such an argument. In the first place,

Australia possesses neither cereals nor any animals which can be domesticated with
120 REPORT--1867.

--advantage ; and in the second, we find, even in the same family, among' children of

the same parents, the most opposite dispositions in the same nation there are

families of high character, and others in which every member is more or less

criminal. But in this case, as in the last, the Archbishop's argument, if good at

all, is good against h)is own view. It is like an Australian boomerang, which

recoils upon its owner. The Archbishop believed in the unity of the human race,

"Howarguing that man was originally civilized (in a certain sense).  comes it,

then," I might ask him, "that the New Hollander is not now in the condition of

the European ? " In another passage, Archbishop Whately quotes with approba-

tion a passage from President Smith, of the College of New Jersey, who says,

that man, " cast out an orphan of nature, naked and helpless, into the savage forest,

must have perished before he could have learned how to supply his most imme-

diate and urgent wants. Suppose him to have been created, or to have started

into being, one knows not how, in the full strength of his bodily powers, how long

must it have been before he could have known the proper use of his limbs, or
how to apply them to climb the tree ? " &c. Exactly the same, however, might

be said of the goriUa or the chimpanzee, which certainly are not the degraded

descendants of civilized ancestors. Having thus very briefly considered the argu-

ments brought forward by Archbishop Whately, I will proceed to state, also veiy

briefly, some facts which seem to militate against the view advocated by him.

First, I will endeavour to show that there are indications of progress even

among savages. Secondly, that among the most civilized nations there are traces

of original barbarism. The Archbishop supposes that men were from the beginning

Weherdsmen and cultivators.  know, however, that the Australians, Tasmanians,

North and South Americans, and several other more or less savage races, living in

countries eminently suited to our domestic animals, and to the cultivation of cereals,

were yet entirely ignorant both of the one and the other. It is, I think, impro-

bable that any race of men, who had once been agriculturists and herdsmen, should

entirely abandon pursuits so easy and so advantageous, and it is still more impro-

bable that if we accept Usher's very limited chronology, all tradition of such a

change should be lost. Moreover, even if the present colonists of (say) America

or Australia were to fall into such a state of barbarism, we shoidd still find in

those countries herds of wild cattle descended from those imported ; and, even if

these were exterminated, still we should find their remains, whereas we know that

no single bone of the ox, or, with one doubtful exception, the domestic sheep, has

been found either in Australia or in the whole extent of America. Moreover the

same argument applies to the horse, as the fossil horse of South America does

Wenot belong to the domestic race. So, again, in the case of plants.  do not

know that any of our cultivated cereals woidd survive in a wild state, though it

is highly probable that in a modified form they would do so. But there are many

other plants which follow in the train of man, and by which the botany of South

America, Australia, and New Zealand has been almost as profoundly modified,

as their ethnology has been, by the arrival of the white man. The Maoris have

a melancholy pro\'erb, that the Maoris disappear before the white man, just as

the white man's rat destroys the native rat ; the European fly drives away the

AMaori fly ; and the clover kills the New Zealand fern.  very interesting paper

--on this subject, by Dr. Hooker, whose authority no one will question, is contained

in the Natural History Eeview for 1864: "In Australia and New Zealand,"

he says, " for instance, the noisy train of English emigration is not more surely

doing its work than the stealthy tide of English weeds, which are creeping over the

surface of the waste, cultivated, and virgin soil, in annually increasing numbers

of genera, species, and indiA-iduals. Apropos of this subject, a coiTespondent,

W. T. Locke Travers, Esq., F.L.S., a most active New Zealand botanist, wi-iting from

Canterbury, says, ' You would be surprised at the rapid spread of European and

foreign plants in this country. All along the sides of the main lines of road through

the plains, a Polyr/omim, called cow-grass, grows most luxuriantly, the roots some-

times two feet in depth, and the plants spreading over an area from four to five feet

in diameter. The dock {Rnmex ohtusifullus or Tt. crisptis) is to be found in every

river-bed extending into the valleys of the mountain-rivers, until these become

mere torrents. The Sow-thistle is spread all over the country, growing luxuriantly

nearly up to 6000 feet. The water-cress increases in our still rivers to such an

extent as to threaten to choke them altogether.' " The Cardoon of the Argentine

WeRepublics is another remarkable instance of the same fact.  may therefore

safely assume that if Australia, New Zealand, or South America had ever been

tries woidd almost inevitably have given evidence of the fact, and differed much

Wefrom the condition in which they were discovered.  may also assert on a

general proposition that no weapons or instruments of metal have ever been found

Ain any coimtry inhabited by savages wholly ignorant of metallurgy.  still

stronger case is afforded by pottery. Pottery is not easily destroyed ; when kno-mi

at all it is always abundant, and it possesses two qualities ; namely, those of being

easy to break, and yet difScult to destroy, which render it very valuable in an

archfeological point of ^dew. Moreover, it is in most cases associated with burials.

It is, therefore, a veiy significant fact, that no fragment of pottery has ever been

found in Australia, New Zealand, or the Polynesian Islands. It seems to me ex-

tremely improbable that an art so easy and so useful should ever have been lost by

any race of men. Again, this argument applies to several other arts and instru-

ments. I will mention only two, though several others might be brought foi-ward.

The art of spinning and the use of the bow are quite unknown to many races

of savages, and yet would hardly be likely to have been abandoned when once

known. The absence of architectural remains in these countries is another argu-

ment. Archbishop Whately, indeed, claims this as being in his favour, but the

absence of monuments in a counti-y is surely indicative of barbarism and not of

civilization. The mental condition of savages seems also to me to speak strongly

against the "degrading" theory. Not only do the religions of the lower races

appear to be indigenous, but I have elsewhere pointed out that, according to

--almost imiversal testimony of all writers on savages merchants, philosophers,
--naval men, and missionaries alike there are many races of men who are alto-

getlier destitute of a religion. The cases are perhaps less numerous than they are

asserted to be, but some of them rest on good evidence. Yet I feel it difficult to,

believe that any people which had once possessed a religion would ever entirely

--lose it. Religion appeals so strongly to the hopes and fears of men it takes so
--deep a hold on most minds it is so great a consolation in times of sorrow and sick-
--ness that I can hardly think any nation would ever abandon it altogether. Where,

therefore, we find a race which is now ignorant of religion, I cannot but assume

that it has always been so. I will now proceed to mention a few cases in which

some improvement does appear to have taken place. According to M'Gillivray,

the Australians of Port Essington, who, like all their fellow-countrymen, had

formerly bark canoes only, have now completely abandoned them for others hol-

lowed out of the trunk of a tree, which they buy from the Malays. It is said

that the inhabitants of the Andaman Islands have recently introduced outriggers.
The Bachapins, when visited by Burchell, had just commenced working iron.

According to Burton, the Wajiji negroes have recently learned to make brass. In

Tahiti, when visited by Captain Cook, the largest moral, or burial-place, was that

erected for the then reigning Queen. The Talaitians, also, had then very recently

abandoned the habit of cannibalism. Moreover there are certain facts which

speak for themselves. Some of the North American tribes cultivated the maize.

Now the maize is a North American plant ; and we have here, therefore, clear evi-

dence of a step in advance made by these tribes. Again, the Peruvians had do-
mesticated the llama. Those who believe in the diversity of species of men may

endeavour to maintain that the Peruvians had domestic llamas from the beginning.

Archbishop Whately, however, would not take this line. He would, I am sure,

admit that the first settlers in Peru had no llamas, nor, indeed, any other domestic

animal, excepting probably the dog. The bark cloth of the Polynesians is another

case in point. Another very strong case is the boomerang of the Australians.

WeWith one doubtful exception this weapon is known to no other race of men.

cannot look on it as a relic of primeval civilization, or it would not now be confined

to one race only. The Australian cannot have learned it from any civilized visitors

for the same reason. It is therefore, as it seems to me, exactly the case we want,

--and a clear proof of a step in advance^a small one if you like but still a step made

by a people whom Archbishop Whately would certainly admit to be true savages.

North American Indians, the picture-writing and Quippu of Central America, must

be regarded as of native origin. In the case of the system of letters invented by

Mohammed Doalu, a negro of the Vei country, in West Africa, the idea was no doubt

borrowed from the missionaries, although it was worked out independently. In

other cases, however, this cannot, I think, be maintained. Take that of the Mexicans.

Even if we suppose that they are descended from a primitively civilized race, and

-- myhad gi-adually and completely lost both the use and tradition of letters to

mind, by the way, a most improbable hypothesis^still we must look on their

system of picture-wi-iting as being of American origin. Even if a system of

-- --writing by letters coidd ever be altogether lost which I doubt it certainly could

not be abandoned for that of picture-writing, which is inferior in every point of
view. If the Mexicans had owed their civilization, not to their own gradual im-

provement, but to the influence of some European visitors, driven by stress of

weather or the pursuit of adventure to their coasts, we should have found in

their system of writing, and in other respects, unmistakeable proofs of such an in-

fluence. Although, therefore, we have no historical proof that the civilization of

America was indigenous, we have in its very character evidence, perhaps, more

satisfactoiy than any historical statements would be. The same argument may be

derived from the names used for numbers by savages. I feel great difliculty in

supposing that any race which had leamt to count up to ten would ever unlearn a

piece of knowledge so easy and yet so useful. Yet we know that few, perhaps none,

of those whom Archbishop Whately would call savages, can count so lar. No

Australian language contained numerals for any number beyond four ; the Dam-

maras and Abipones use none beyond    three                        some of the Brazilian                           tribes        cannot

go beyond two. In many cases where the system of numeration is at present some-
what more advanced, it bears on it the stamp of native and recent origin. Among

civilized nations, the derivations of the numerals have long since been obscured by

the gi-adual modification which time  effects  in                  all  words                                 especially those   in  fre-

quent use, and before the invention of printing. And if the numerals of savages

were relics of a former ci\-ilization, the waifs and strays saved out of the general

wreck, though we could not expect to trace them up to that original language,

which in such a case must have existed, yet we certainly should not find them such

as they really are. I cannot, of course, here give to this argument all the deve-

lopment of which it is capable, or bring forward all the cases in point ; but I will

quote a short passage from a very interesting lecture delivered before the Royal

Institution by my friend Mr. Tylor, in which some of the facts are clearly stated.

" Among many tribes of North and South America and West Africa are found

--such expressions aa for 5, * a whole hand ; ' and for 6, ' one to the other hand ;

10, ' both hands ; ' and 11, ' one to the foot ; ' 20, ' one Indian ; ' and 21, ' one to

the hands of the other Indian ; '  or for II,  ' foot                           ;  for                        12,  ' foot 2 ; '  for 20, ' a

                                                                        1'

person is finished ; ' while among the miserable natives of Van Diemen's Land the

reckoning of a single hand, -viz. 5, is called puganna, 'a man.'" For displaying

to us the picture of the savage counting on his fingers, a being struck with the idea

that, if he desciibes in words his gestures of reckoning, these words will become a

numeral, perhaps no language approaches the Zulu. Counting on his fingers, he

begins always with the little finger of his left hand, and thus reaching 5, he calls

it " a whole hand ; " for 6, he translates the appropriate gesture, calling it tafisitupa,

" take the thumb ; " while 7, being shown in gesture by the forefinger, and this

fino-er being used to point with, the verb komba, " to point," comes to serve as a

nrmieral expression, denoting 7. Here, then, surely we have just the e\idence

which Archbishop Whately required. These numerals are recent, because they

are uncorrupted, and they are indigenous, because they have an evident meaning

in the language of the tribes by whom they are used. Again, we know that

many savage languages are entirely deficient in such words as " colour," " tone,"

" tree," &c., having names for each kind of colour, every species of tree, but not

for the general idea. I can hardly imagine a nation losing such words if it had

once possessed them. Other similar evidence might be extracted from the lan-

guage of savages ; and arguments of this nature are entitled to more weight than

statements of travellers, as to the objects foimd in use among savages. Suppose,

for instance, that an early traveller mentioned the absence of some art or know-

ledge among a race visited by him, and that later ones foimd the natives in pos-

session of it. Most people would hesitate to receive this as a clear evidence of

progress, and rather he disposed to suspect that later travellers, with perhaps bet-
ter opportunities, had seen what their predecessors had overlooked. This is no

hj'pothetical case. The early Spanish writers assert that the inhabitants of the

Ladrone Islands were ignorant ot the use of fire. Later travellers, on the con-

trary, find them perfectly well acquainted with it. They have, therefore, almost

unanimously assumed, not that the natives had made a step in advance, but that

the Spaniards had made a mistake ; and I have not brought this case forward in oppo-

sition to the assertions of Whately, because I am inclined to be of the same opinion
myself. I refer to it here, however, as showing how dilficult it would be to obtain

satisfactory e\-idence of material progi-ess among savages, even admitting that such

exists. The arguments derived from language, however, are liable to no such
suspicions ; but tell their own tale, and leave us at liberty to draw our conclusions.

   1 will now very briefly refer to certain considerations which seem to show that

even the most ci%-ilized races were once in a state of barbarism. Not only

throughout Europe, not only in Italy and Greece, but even in the so-called cradle

-- -- --of civilization itself in Palestine and Syria in Egypt and in India the traces of

the stone age have been discovered. It may, indeed, be said that these were only

the fragments of those stone knives &c. which we know were used in religious

ceremonies long after metal was in general use for secular purposes. This indeed

reminds one of the attempt to account for the presence of elephants' bones in

England, by supposing that they were the remains of elephants which might have

been brought over by the Romans. But why were stone knives used by the

Egyptian and Jewish priests ? E-\-idently because they had been at one time in
general use, and there was a feeUng of respect which made them reluctant to use

the new substance in religious ceremonies. There are, moreover, other considera-

tions which point vei-y decidedly to the same conclusion. It is well known that
among various savage tribes female ^-irtue is looked on with a very indifferent eye.

-- --Some savages have not I will not say have not arrived .at the idea of marriage.

I cannot here bring forwai-d the evidence in support of this statement, but every

one who has taken any interest in the lower races of men will admit that a savao-e's
wives are essentially a part of his property, as much so as his dog or his other slaves
and hence, when a man dies, his brother takes possession of the widow, together
with the rest of the property. In those cases where women are treated with rather
more justice, the first results are, according to our ideas, of doubtful advantage.
Among the Andaman Islanders, for instance, the man and woman remain together
only until the child is born and weaned, when they are free to separate and pair
with others. In other cases, maniage may be terminated at the wish either of

the husband or the wife. In others, again, the tie is of such a nature that it affords

not even a presumption as to parentage. The result of this is that many savao-es

have no idea of any relationship by paternity ; they recognize kinship through the

female line only. This is the case with the Australians, the Fijians, and indeed
the South Sea Islanders generally ; the ancient Celts, Greeks, the Kasias, Nairs,

and other tribes in Hindostan ; some of the Cossack hordes, many negro tribes,

 &c., and traces of it occur all over the world. For the same reason a man's

heirs are not his own children, but those of his sisters ; while, probably again for
the same reason, the Wanyamwezi have the (at first sight) inexplicable custom

that a man's property goes to his illegitimate children, and not to his lawful off-

spring. Thus, then, by tracing up the gradual construction of the idea of marriage,

--we can account for the two extraordinary customs which we find in every part of

the world that a man is regarded as no relation to his own children, and that his

property goes not to them, but to those of his sisters. As things improved, and
 the probability of parentage became greater, kinship through females only would
gradually be abandoned. Many savages have not yet advanced so far, others have
recently made the change--as, for instance, the Ait-Iraten, who did so less than a
century ago, and erected a stone pillar in memory of the event. Even, however
among the most civilized nations, we find in early history traces of this progi-es-
 sion. Thus among the early Jews, Abraham married his half-si*ster. Nahor mar-

ried his brother's daughter, and Amram mamed his father's sister. Here we see the
system of kinship through females only. These women were not at that time re-
--134 REPORT 1867.

garded as relatives, tliougli at a later period in Jewish history they would have been

so. The custom that when a man died childless his brother mamed the widow is

another case in point, as also is the touching story of Ruth and Boaz, and the sad

history of Tamar. Similar considerations, as Mr. M'Lennan points out in his ex-

cellent book on Primitive Maniage, prove that the Romans were " at one time in

pari passu as regards the administration of justice with many races, which we find

ignorant of legal proceedings, and dependent for the settlement of their disputes on

force of arms or the good offices of friends ; " while, as regards marriage, we find

customs both among the Greeks and Romans which point back to the time when

those polished peoples were themselves mere savages. Even among ourselves a

man is, in the eye of the law, no relation to his own children unless they are born

in wedlock. He is related to his own offspring not hj blood, but through his mar-

riage with the mother. If marriage has not taken place they have no right to his

name and should he leave them any of his property, the State steps in and claims
                           ;

one-tenth, as in cases where money is left to those who are no relations. Thus,

then, we can trace up among races in diflterent stages of civilization every step,

from the treatment of woman as a mere chattel to the sacred idea of matrimony as

it exists among ourselves, and we find clear evidence that the gradual change has

been one of progress and not of degradation. Civilized nations long retain traces

of their ancient barbarism ; barbarous ones, no relics of pre-^dous chivalry. As the
valves in the veins indicate the direction of the circulation, so can we trace the

gradual progress of respect for women, which is one of the noblest features of our

modern civilization. Before quitting this interesting subject, I may add that

many nations have traditions of the origin of marriage. Among the Egyptians

it is attributed to Menes, among the Chinese to Folhi, the Greeks to Cecrops, the

Hindoos to Svetaketu. If the idea of marriage had been coeval with our race,

if marriage had always appeared as natm-al, I might say as necessary, as it does

to us, such traditions could scarcely have arisen. In the publications of the Nova

Scotian Institute of Natural Science is an interesting paper by Mr. Haliburton

on " The Unity of the Human Race, proved by the universality of certain super-

stitions connected with sneezing." " Once establish," he says, " that a large num-

ber of arbitrary customs, such as could not have naturally suggested themselves

to all men at all times, are universally observed, and we arrive at the conclusion

that they are primitive customs, which have been inherited from a common

source ; and, if inherited, that they owe their origin to an era anterior to the dis-

persion of the human race." To justify such a conclusion, the custom must be

demonstrably arbitrary. The belief that two and two make four, the division of

the year into twelve months, and similar coincidences, of course, proves nothing,

and I very much doubt the existence of any universal, or even general, custom of

a clearly arbitrary character. The fact is that many things appear to us arbitrary

and absurd because we live in a condition so difterent from that in which they

originated. Many things seem natm'al to a savage which to us are unaccountable.

Mr. Haliburton brings forward as his strongest case the habit of saying " God

bless you," or some equivalent expression, when a person sneezes. He shows

that this custom, which I admit appears to us at first sight both odd and arbitraiy,

is ancient and widely extended. It is mentioned by Homer, Aristotle, Apuleius,

Pliny, and the Jewish rabbis, and has been observed in Florida, in Otaheite, and

in the Tonga Islands. That it is not arbitrary, however, jNIr. Haliburton himself

Ashows, and it does not therefore come under his rule.  belief in invisible beings

is very general among savages, and while they think it imnecessary to account

for blessings, they attribute any misfortime to the iU-will of these mj^sterious

beings. Many savages regard disease as a case of possession. In cases of illness

they do not suppose that the organs are themselves affected, but that they are

being devoured by a god. Hence their medicine men do not try to ciu-e the dis-

ease, but to extract the demon. Some tribes have a distinct deity for everj^ ail-

ment. The Australians do not believe in natural death. ^Mien a man dies they

take for granted that he has been destroyed by witchcraft, and onlj^ doubt who is

--the culprit. Nolv a people in this state of mind and we know that almost every
--race of men is passing or has passed through this stage of development seeing a

.man sneeze, would naturally and almost inevitably suppose that he was attacked

iand shaken by some invisible being ; equally natural is the impulse to appeal for

aid to some other invisible being more powerful than the first. Mr. Haliburton

--admits that a sneeze is " an omen of impending evil ; " but it is more it is evi-

dence vrhich, to the savage mind, would seem conclusive that the sneezer was

possessed by some evil-disposed spirit. Evidently, therefore, this case, on which

Mr. Halibui'ton so muck relies, is by no means an " arbitrary custom," and does
not therefore fulfil the conditions which he himself laid down. He has inciden-

tally brought forward some other instances, most of which labour under the disad-

"^antage of proving too much. Thus he instances the existence of a festival in

honour of the dead, "at or near the beginning of November." Such a feast is
very general, and as there are many more races holding such a festival than there

are months in the year, it is evident that in several cases they must be held to-

gether. But Mr. Haliburton goes on to say, " The Spaniards were very natm-ally

surprised at finding that, while they were celebrating a solemn mass for All Souls

on the 2nd of November, the heathen Peruvians were also holding their annual

commemoration of the dead." This curious coincidence would, however, not

only prove the existence of such a festival "before the dispersion" (which Mr.

Haliburton evidently looks on as a definite event, instead of a gi-adual process),

but also that men were at that epoch sufficiently advanced to form a calendar and
keep it unchanged down to the present time. This, however, we know was not

the case. Mr. Haliburton again says, " The belief in Scotland and Equatorial Africa

is found to be ahnost precisely identical respecting there being ghosts even of the

living, who are exceedinglv troublesome and pugnacious, and can be sometimes
killed by a silver bullet." -Here we certainly have what seems to be an arbitrary

belief, but if it proves that there was a belief in ghosts of the living before the

dispersion, it also proves that silver bullets were then in use. This illustration is,

I think, a very interesting one, because it shows that similar ideas in distant

coimtries owe their origin, not " to an era before the dispersion of the human race,"
but to the original identity of the human mind. While I do not believe that

similar customs in difierent nations are " inherited from a common source," or are
necessarily primitive, 1 certainly do see in them an argument for the unity of the
human race, which, however, be it remarked in parenthesis, is not necessarily the

same thing as the descent from a single pair.

. In conclusion, then, while I do not deny that there are cases in which nations

have retrograded, I regard these as exceptional instances. The facts and argu-

ments which I have here very briefly indicated might have been supported by many

other illustrations which I could not bring before you without unduly extending a

--communication already somewhat too long. They, however, I think, afford strong

grounds for the following conclusions namely, that existing savages are not de-

scendants of civilized ancestors ; that the primitive condition of man was one of

utter barbarism ; that from this condition several races have independently raised

themselves. These views follow, I think, from strictly scientific considerations.

We shall not, however, be the less inclined to adopt them on account of the cheer-

ing prospects which they hold out for the future. If the past history of man has
been one of deterioration, we have but a groundless expectation of future improve-

ment                             but,  on the other hand, if  the past has been one of progress, we  may fairly
                              ;

hope that the future will be so too ; that the blessings of civilization will not only

be extended to other countries and other nations, but that even in our own land
they wiU be rendered more general and more equable, so that we shall not see before
us always, as now, multitudes of our own fellow-countrymen living the life of

savages in our very midst ; neither possessing the rough advantages and real, though

coarse, pleasures of savage life, nor yet availing themselves of the far higher and
more noble opportunities which lie within the reach of civilized man.

--mini, which is an affair of winds and currents. Panama has the advantage in

shortness of land transit ; Nicaragua in winds, terminal ports, and climate. As a

rule, the prevailing winds, in the belt of ocean between 35° N. and 35° S., are from
the eastward, except the belt of equatorial calms, which extends across the Pa-

cific. Looking westward, therefore, towards Australia or Eastern Asia, Panama
is to windward ; the commercial routes from thence westward are thus to leeward,
whilst the return voyages are to windward. By making a detour, the return
voyage would not be so difficult, but other physical difficulties stand in the way of
navigation. Panama lies in the equatorial belt of calm, which is greatly widened

on the Pacific coast, and sailing-vessels are often detained for weeks by it.
II.M.S. 'Herald'was once obliged to be towed by a steamer for 700 miles outof this
calm-belt before she could find a breeze. Vessels, therefore, to get clear of the

calms in the season in which they prevail, even when their destination is south-
ward, are obliged to move up the coast towards Costa Rica, and then get north-
ward until they reach the N.E. trade-winds, on which they depend for getting out

to sea, clear of the calms. This peculiar feature decides the question of the most
desirable route across the Isthmus, which would be in a latitude where the calms
would not suiTOund the port of the Pacific terminus, and so cause no obstacle to
the approach and departure of sailing-vessels throughout the year. Several routes
have been proposed across the northern portions of the Isthmus, lying out of the

reoion of calms. On an examination of the physical conditions of each, and espe-

cially the winds at the ports of each terminus, the author gives the preference to
a route which would cross Nicaragua near to the north-west end of the Lake of
Nicaragua, and terminate at the Port of Realejo. Healejo is on the northern
verge of the tedious calms of Panama, and the point where they neaily cease to be
vexatious to the navigator at any season.

               International Pre-historic and Anthropological Conf/ress.

                 By Sir R. I. Muechison, Bart., K.C.B., F.R.S.

   Sir R. I. Murchison read a letter from M. Lartet announcing that at the sitting
of the International Congress of Pre-historic Ai'chseology and Anthropology, held
at Paris on the 29th of August, it was resolved to hold the Meeting of 1868 in
England, and that Sir R. I. Murchison had been elected President thereof Upon
this, Sir Roderick explained to the Section that he had replied to M. Lartet, stat-
ing that he was under the necessity of declining the honourable post assigned to
him, as he had already made arrangements, on account of the state of his health,

to be absent from England during the ensuing summer. He therefore suggested

that Sir Charles Lyell, Sir J. Lubbock, Prof. Busk, Mr. J. Evans, Mr. Prestwich,
and Mr. A. Franks should he a Committee, with which he would gladly cooperate
to organize the arrangements and fix the place and date of meeting*.

        Observations on the Livhigstone Search Expedition now in progress.

             Bg Sir R. I. Murchison, Bart., K.C.B., LL.D., F.R.S.

   Sir R. Mm-ehisou explained at some length the various reasons which had led
him to disbelieve the story of Dr. Livingstone's death, as narrated to the Consul
at Zanzibar and T)r. Kirk by Moussa, tlie Johana man, the sole witness of the
catastrophe. Having given several proofs of the mendacity of this Moussa, he
specially dwelt upon his gi-oss prevarication in having given to one of the sepoys
of the expedition an account of the death of Li^dngstone entii-ely differing from
that which he gave to the Consul at Zanzibar. Under these circimistances
Sir R. Mm-chison had felt it to be his duty as President of the Royal Geographical
Society, to induce the Coimcil of that body to appeal to Her Majesty's Govern-
ment to fit out, at small cost, a searching-boat expedition, which, to their gi-eat

credit, the Admiralty had efi'ectively carried out. He described the pieced struc-
ture of the steel boat which had reached the Cape of Good Hope, to be thence
ti-ansmitted to the mouth of the Zambesi river. He then explained how it was to

be there put together and manned by natives under the command of Mr. Young, of
the Royal Navy, the zealous wan-ant officer who had during upwards of two years
commanded the ' Pioneer ' under Dr. Livingstone himself. With two other accli-
matized British seamen, and accompanied by a volunteer, Mr. Falkner, Mr. Young
was directed to ascend the Zambesi to the mouth of its great affluent the Shire.

There the boat woidd be taken to pieces and canied up on the sides of those great
and long rapids to which Li-\dngstone had attached the name of the Mm-chison Falls,
at the head of which it would be reconsti-ucted in order to ascend the Shire, to the
most western end of the Great Lake Nyassa, near to which is the spot where, as
reported, the great traveller was killed. Having ascertained the true facts, it was
estimated that the expedition woidd on its return reach the mouth of the Zambesi
at the end of November, and hence it is hoped that in January of 1868 the painful

suspense of the public will be set at rest*.

   " If," Sir Roderick added, " we can only ascertain that my valued friend was

not killed at that spot, but passed on towards the interior accompanied by a few-

obstacles that not a man in a million can face, and who traversed and retraversed
South Afiica with black men only, having been also reported to be dead, may emerge

the vast lake Tanganyika is or is not a gi-eat southern water-basin of the Nile."

Description of Tivo Routes through Nicararjiia. By Lietit. S. P. Olivek, R.A.

   The author described a journey he had made, between the months of February
and July of the present year, up the river San Juan in Nicaragua, and across the
new line overland, between the Lake and the Gulf of Mexico, which has just been
cleared through ihe forest in prepai-ation for a railroad projected by Capt. Bedford
Pirn. The tract of coimtiy traversed was, until the present expedition, a terra
incognita, occupied by vast impenetrable forests of gigantic trees, dense under-
wood, and entangled woody creepers. The line commences on the Lake of Nica-

ragua, at San Miguelito, and ends at the Rama river, in the Gulf of Mexico. At

San Miguelito, the variation of the compass was ascertained to be 4° 30' east.

On the Mining District of Chontales, Nicaragua. By Capt. Bedford Pim, B.N,

 --In its phyiscal aspect, Nicaragua may be divided into three longitudinal sec-

tions : 1. T^he Atlantic side, which is, for the most part, low and alluvial, inter-
sected by numerous rivei-s, having bars at their mouths, with lagoons inside afford-

ing an almost uninten-upted water navigation. The land is everywhere rich, and

well adapted to the production of Sea-Island cotton. 2. The Pacific side, having

precipitous shores, and no river worthy of the name. The region is eminently
Avolcanic, and destitute of minerals.
                                       curious feature is the number and extent

of the lakes spread over its surface, including Lake Nicaragua, ninety miles wide

by forty broad. The small lake Nijapa presents some marked pecidiarities ; the

specific gravity of its water is 1-8, and it is hot to the taste, acrid, and smelling of

sulphuretted hydrogen. It is of a light greenish -yellow colour, very thick and

turbid, and on being kept some time deposits a black precipitate, consisting chiefly

of iron. Some of the lalces are fathomless, and pure as ciystal. 3. The last sec-
tion consists of the dividing ridge between the other two, attaining a maximum

elevation of 5C(X) feet. In this district gold and silver are foimd, and in its
Asouthern part lie the mines of Chontales.
                                            dense, imbroken primajval forest

covers the greater part of this region, containing a profusion of valuable timber

trees, such as cedar, mahogany, sapota, leopard wood for cabinet work, canilla (an

--easily worked wood), venaca (a light sort of boxwood), &c. The Atlantic side is

very humid indeed, white residents jocularly remark that it rains thirteen months
in the year ; but it is not unhealthy, and the strong north-east trade-winds temper

the heat of the climate. The Pacific coast region is contrasted with the opposite

Bide by the sharp distinction between the wet and dry seasons, and the stunted
gi-owth of the trees. Gold was first discovered in 1850, and was worked in a rude

manner near San Juan. It was not, however, till 1864 that political and other

circumstances permitted of an accurate examination of the mining distiict by a

party sent out from England, including Mr. W. C. Paul, a mining engineer. The

exploration of the forest-clad district commenced at San Miguelito, near the
Awestern extremity of Lake Nicaragua.
                                            narrow tract leads hence, via Acoyapa,

Lovogo and Libertad, to the mining district, which lies a little to the east of the

watershed between the lakes and the Atlantic, and near the Eiver Mico, a branch

of the Blewfields. The San Juan mine, close to the Mico, was examined, and

found to be of rich promise, but the method of working it was very inefficient.

Holes 25 feet deep were dug, and adits driven on each side of them until water

was met with, which caused the abandonment of the excavation, although the lode

becomes richer as depth is increased. Various excursions were made in the vicinity

of Libertad, and the existence of valuable lodes of gold and silver satisfactorily

established. The Indian village of Kinalala, at the head of the navigable waters

of the Blewfields river, is the nearest point of embarkation direct for the Atlantic.

The absence of a certain, speedy, and secure means of communication with the sea-

coast is the only serious difficulty which mining enterprise will have to encounter

in the development of these newly discovered mineral resources of Nicaragua.

     On the Colony of New Scotland, in Southern Africa. By J. J. Peatt.

   This was a description of an elevated district on the eastern slopes of the
Drakensburgh mountains, north of Natal, which has lately been opened for Euro-
pean immigration by the Government of the Trans- Vaal Republic. The climate
was described to be good, and the land suitable for pastoral pui-poses.

Exploration of the Isthmus of Barien, with a view to discovering a xyractical

                line for a Ship 'Canal. By M. Ltjcien de Puydt.

This paper communicated the scientific results of two explorations of the Isth-

mus of Darien, made by the author in the years 1861 and 1865, with the object

of discovering a practicable line for a ship canal to connect the two oceans. His

researches in the first expedition were directed towards the line proposed some

seventeen years ago by Dr. CuUen, between the Gulf of St. Miguel and Caledonia

Bay, which had been insufficiently explored by the international expedition sent

out about that time. The result of this first journey was to confirm the con-

clusion arrived at by Mr. Gisborn in 1851, namely, that no practicable line exists

for an interoceauic canal in this direction. The expedition led by M. de Piiydt

thereupon returned to France, and in 1864 he was charged by the French Govern-

ment to organize another party, for the pui-pose of thoroughly examining the low

rauge of the Andes about sixty miles to the south of the former line, where several

small streams discharge themselves into the Atlantic, near the northern arms of

the river Atrato. The expedition was formed in New Granada, and, after a toil-

some exploration of several months, in 1865 the author succeeded in discovering

a break in the Andes, at the upper course of the river Talela, which renders

possible the long desired object. One of the chief obstacles anticipated was the

opposition of the  suspicious  and warlike  Indian tribes                                                              but M. de Puydt, by judi-

cious management, contrived to enlist their goodwill so far as not to oppose his

designs, although they refused to afford him any assistance or information.

Having landed his party and materiel, he ascended the Tanela as far as practi-

cable, and tlien proceeded to clear a pathway tlirough the dense forest towards the

Cordillera. The laborious task occupied about a month. The author then (Au-

gust 25), with six companions, left the track, and threaded the f^orest to the Sierra

de Mali, and in the course of a few days came upon a break in the ridge, ele-

vated only from 100 to 140 feet above the sea-level. The gap was traversed, and

from it an iminterrupted view was obtained over the level plains of Darieu towards

tlie Pacific Ocean. Tlie Tanela was found winding- through the pass, and the
stream was tracked down towards the level country, and observations taken of the

velocity of its cm-rent, so as to obtain data for a calculation of the height of the

pass. The paper entered into ample details on the physical geography of the At-
lantic side of the Isthmus, on the soundings in the Gulf of Uraba, into which the
Atlantic end of the future ship canal will disembogue, and on the climate and
natives. The expedition returned to Carthagena on the 3rd of September, 186-5.

Accomit of the Wild Indians inJiahitinr/ the Forests of Himnta, Peru.

                                  Bij Professor A. IIaimondy.

These Indians belong to the tiibe of Campos, or Antis, and are found scattered

through the forests of Chunchamayo, Jauja, Pangos, Huanta, and the valley of

Santa Ana, near Cuzco. They occupy the country along the shores of the rivers

Santa Ana and Tambo, to the point at which they unite to form the TJcayali, where

the territory of the Chontaqiiinros commences. The Campos are of medium stature,

although some few are tall : one man measured six feet (Spanish) in height. The

head is dolichocephalic.  They have prominent cheek-bones                                                                                                                                                              nose  of Roman type,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

but slightly turned up, and with thick septum ; eyes lively and expressi^e, not well-

opened, and rather oblique. The females have white teeth ; but in the men the

teeth are dark, caused by their continually chewing the bark of a species of Bigno-

pia. The men have little or no beard. The hair is black. The colour of the face

is reddish or olive-coloured ; but in children it is nearly white. The Campos clothe

themselves with a wide and sack-like garment of cotton, neatly woven by the

women, sometimes having stripes of a reddish colour. It reaches down to the

ankles, and has sometimes attached to it a kind of hood for the head, made of the

same material. Wherever they go they cany with them, slung over the back,

a large cotton bag, the chaqui, which contains' all their worldly treasures, and is

sometimes ornamented with the gay-coloured feathers of birds. I'lie bag invariably

contains a bamboo box filled with anatto paste, with which they besmear their

faces from time to time, so that the natm-al colour of the face is seldom seen, the con-

tinual painting of the skin with stripes and various patterns of red imparting a per-

manent red tinge to the countenance. Their dwellings are small and reduced to a

mere thatch, some five or six yards in length by four in width, supported on poles

--fixed in the ground. Under these is the sleeping apartment, a conical hut, made

of a matting of palm-leaves, and looking like a hen-coop. In this confined space,
which is almost hermetically closed, they sleep, five or six together, apparently

piled one on the top of another, to protect themselves, as they say, from the bites

of bats. When the nights are clear, and the Campos are near the shores of a river,

they leave their huts and sleep in the open air by the side of a fire, lying naked on

the gi-oimd, and wi'apping their feet in their bags. Whenever the author arrived
at a hut, the Campo husband would always make a sign to his wife, who then

brought pine-apples or cooked yucas for the guest. Their main food is boiled and
roasted yuca (the root of Manihot utilissima), and fish or beasts of the chase, as
peccaries, and monkeys of various species. Their language is soft to the ear, being

full of vowels, and nearly all the words ending in i, u, or o. Their mode of speak-

ing is gentle, often in a sinning tone, as if supplicating. There are times when their
manner of talking is very difterent, and in a loud tone of voice. This happens when

they have not seen one another for a long time. Descending the Apurimac, on his

joirrney to ascertain its point of junction with the Mantaro, the author anived one

night at a Campo 's hut. His party had hardly landed, when the Campos who ac-
companied him commenced a loud parly with the owner of the establishment.

The conversation was long, and sustained at a high pitch of voice, lasting till day-
break the next morning. The subject of conversation was a recital, even to the

most trifling matters, of everything that had occun-ed to the parties since they last
met. The Campos count only up to four; when they want to express larger

numbers, they hold up their hands, feet, and pieces of stone. As to their religion,

no idols or ceremonies were observed. They do not take any care of their dead

stones are tied to the corpse, and it is then thrown into the river. If, when eating

of the food will fall ill. They no not show the humility of demeauoui- which is seen

in Indians of the Quichua race ; they are more manly, looking you sti-aight in the
face when speaking. The author paid some attention to the form of the cra-
nium in these Indian tribes. AVheu studying skuUs of ancient Peruvians, taken from
the Hiiacas, or tombs on the coast, his attention was drawn to the position of the
orifice of the ear, which, far from being situated more towards the posterior pai-t
of the cranium, as in Em-opean nations, appeal's to be earned forward towards the

fr-ont. Applying this same observation to the crania of the wild Indians now ex-
isting, he noticed a gxeat resemblance to those of the ancient race ; both show a

gi-eater development of the posterior part of the brain than of the anterior. His
mode of measurement was by striking three perpendicular lines, with the skull in

--profile one passing by the most salient part of the forehead, another by the orifice

of the ear, and the thii'd by the most projecting pai't of the back of the skull. In
a Campo skuU, the breadth of the ante-auriculax part was 76 millimetres, and that

of the post-amicular part 92 mUlimetres.

                                On the Vlal-hs of Mount P'mdus.

                     By Major Eobi;rt Stuart, C.B., F.E.G.S.

    There are fair gi-ounds for believing that the Piudic Vlakhs ai-e descendants
of one or more of those tribes which, in the fifth and succeeding centmies, were
driven from then- homes on the Lower Danube by the incm-siou of overpoweiing
hordes from the north and east. Then- language, although corrupt and debased,

with alloys of Sclavic, Greek, and Turkish, still retains the essential chai-acteristics
of a Larin dialect ; and the syntax and inflections of the verbs still conform in a

remarkable degi-ee to the ancient model. Heads and faces of unquestionably Roman

type are foimd amongst them. Sixty years ago there were about 500 \lakhiote
viUag-es, none veiy small, dispersed throughout the moimtains of Epirus, Thessaly,

and Macedonia. At present it would be difficult to reckon up half that number,

and the population has dwindled to about 45,000 souls. Originally a pastoral

people, they have gradually become traders, and most of their chief towns are now
centi-es of commerce and industry. These are Makho-Livadhi, near- Mount OljTnpus,

"S'oskopolis of the Dessai-ets, Metzovo, Syraku, and Calabrites. In the beginning

of the present century, Calabrites counted neaiiy 600 families, and it became known

throughout the Levant for the indusfry, enterprise, and literary cirltm-e of its in-
habitants. They Avere self-governed, and fi-ee of all Tm-ldsh imposts by paying a
fixed and moderate annual tribute. This state of things became changed a few
years later, by the tyrannous intervention of Ali Pasha Tepeleni, under whose rapa-
cious exactions the conununity rapidly simk into poverty and ruin. The stoiy of
 Calabrites is, with slight variation, that of most of the chief towns of the western
Vlakhs. Metzovo was founded by a Vlakh colony as early as the tenth centmy.

It now contains 770 houses, and is the chief town of the Piudic Makhs. For

 several centuries the Vlakhs have been staunch in their adherence to the Eastern

 Chmch. In evei-y central village a school is maintained at the expense of the
 comniimity, the c'oiu-se of instruction embracing modern Greek, reading, writing,
 and the first rules of arithmetic. But education is confined to the male sex. The
 Vlalih woman is treated as an inferior being, and from early years is habituated to

 di-udgery and toil: she is natui-ally robust and handsome. Numbers of Makh
 women come every autumn to Jauina, where they contend with the Jews as street-

 porters. Like all other pastoral tribes, the "Slakhs have their music ; and their
 favoiuite instrument is a pipe (x^Xoyepa), made from the wing-bone of a vultru-e,
 open at both ends, and pierced with six holes, all on the same side. The player

 inserts one end into the side of the mouth, and produces notes which may be varied
 from sharp and shrill to soft and pleasing. The nomade Scythians of old used to
 play on a similar insti-ument. The Vlakhs are superior to the Greeks in foresight,
 perseverance, and application. The lineaments of the old race are not yet lost.
 Though quiet and inofieusivc; when roused to action they give proofs of great

 daring and enterprise.

           A Penivian Expedition up the Rivers Ucayali and Pachitea.

                               By Messrs. Waxlace and Matije.

      lu June 1866 the Peniviau Government sent a steamer from tlieir establish-
   ment at Iquitos, on the Upper Amazons, to ascend the Pachitea, an affluent of the
   Ucayali, with a view to ascertaining -whether a free conunimication could he dis-
   covered by water to the town of Maj'ro, in Soiithern Peru, at the foot of the

   Andes, east of Lima. Two of the officers, Tavira and West, were killed and de-

   voiu'ed on the banks of the Pachitea, by the savage cannibal Indians of the Cashibo
   tribe ; and in November of the same j-ear a second expedition in three steamers
   was sent, with the double pm-pose of avenging the death of the officers and com-
   pleting the exploration. The expedition was successfid ; the Indians were severely
   punished, by an armed party landing in the forest and burning their villages ; and
   the steamers continued up the Pachitea and Palcazu imtil they reached Mayro,
   thus settling the practicability of a route by water between Mayro and the mouth

   --of the Amazons a distance of 3G23 miles. Mayro is said to be 325 miles from

   Lima, and the Government have ordered a road to be made between the two

   places. Mr. Wallace, one of the authors of the paper, is an English engineer in

   the seiTice of Peru. The lowest depth of water found on the journey was two
   fathoms, and the river in its narrowest parts was 80 feet broad.

      This paper gave a detailed description of the examination made by Lieut. War-
   ren of the inclosure Ilaram esh Sliarilf, which contains within its walls the site of
   the Jewish Temple, and, as some hold, also that of the Holy Sepidchre. With the

   exception of a deep hollow in front of the Golden Gate, a slight rise towards the
   north-west corner, and the raised platform in the centre, the sm-face of the area is
   almost level, and has an elevation of 2419 feet abo-se the sea-level. During the

   progress of the survey a large arch, connecting the Haram area with the causeway,
   was discovered north of the AVailing Place. The arch is one of the most perfect
   and magnificent remains in the city. Much information was also obtained con-
   cerning the ancient water-supply, which ^vas admirably arranged. The water was

   brought by an aqueduct from the Pools of Solomon, and stored in rock-hewn cis-
   terns, with connecting channels and arrangements for overflotv. Several of the
   cisterns were found to be of great size, varying from twenty-live to fifty feet iti

   height.

    Bepjort of the Palestine Exploration Fund. By Capt. C. W. Wilson, R.E.

      This Report was confined to a statement of the manner in which the sxmi of £100,
   gi-anted last year to the Fund hj the British Association, had been expended.
   Half of it had been applied towards paying the expenses of Lieut. Wan-en, R.E.,

   who had charge of the second expedition sent out by the Society. The results

   might be stated as follows : the construction of a map, on a scale of one inch to a
   mile, of the highland districts of Judea, to the north-east and south-west of Jeru-
   salem ; of the Jordan valley for about sixteen miles north of the Dead Sea ; and of
   a large portion of the plains of Philistia. These surveys, combined vAih those

   made in 18G5-66 bj^ Wilson and Anderson, gave, for the first time, materials for a
   coiTect map of more than three-fourths of the Holy Land, and do much towards
   removing the reproach that no trustworthy map existed of this most interesting-
   country. The second half of the gi'ant, applied to the piu-chase of meteorological
   instriuuents, had been expended under the superintendence of Mr.Glaisher, and four
   sets of instruments had been sent to different cities in Palestine. The observations

   taken at these places will, combined with those taken at Jerusalem, form the basis

   of an accurate knowledge of the climate of the Holy Land, so remarkable in many

   respects,

ECONOMIC SCIENCE AND STATISTICS.

Address hy M. E. Grant Ditff, M.P., President of the Section.

--Ladies and Gentlemen, It has been the custom to open tlio proceedings of this

Section by an address, and it has been the custom that that address should be a

brief one. I propose, with your permission, to follow both these good customs.

This department of the British Association differs from the others. Tliey are oc-
Wecupied exclusively with the study of external natiu-e.
                                                          are occupied, as has been

truly said, with external nature only in so far as it exerts an influence on the

human mind. They treat of physical sciences. Our Section throws its roots, so

to speak, deep down among the physical sciences, but is itself devoted to moral

science. Looked at in another light, our pursuits form the debateable land between

the men of thought and the men of action. In theorj^, of course, we are given up

exclusively to the examination of thin(/s as they are to science. But do Ave not

continually stray over the border line, and wander into the consideration of things

as they should he into the domain of the art of legislation and Government ? Those

who are familiar with the proceedings of this Section will not, I think, say No ; and

this intermediate character of our department accounts, I suppose, for the fact that

it is from time to time presided over by Members of Parliament, who, votaries of

practical politics, cannot pretend to be teachers of the sciences with which this

Section is concerned ; cannot even pretend to be the fellow-labourers of some

whom I see around me, but are content be in this field their disciples and fol-

lowers. The British Association, founded in 1831, was one of the results of that

great upheaval of the national mind, of which the political change which makes

the year 1832 so famous was perhaps the most conspicuous symptom. The founda-

tion of the Statistical Society, and of our own Section, both of which I trust have

done something to help on the forward movement of the time, came shortly after-

wards, and the latter of these events must have very nearly sjaichronized with the

commencement of that remarkable reactionary movement, which, taking its rise in

the common room of Oriel, has since so widely and variously influenced English life.

An eminent living writer might find perhaps in this fact another illustration of the

operation of Systole and Diastole in human aftairs. Up to 1856, this Section was

exclusively occupied with statistics. In that year, the centenary of the publica-

tion of Quesnay's Ma.vimes Generales, and 80 years after the appearance of Adam

Smith's great work, the kindred subject of Economic Science was wisely added

to our programme. Now, then, we are the Section of Economic Science and

Statistics. What do these terms mean, and with what sort of subjects will chance

visitors who stray into these regions from more popular Sections find iis dealing

during the next" few days ? They will find us, in our character of students of

Economic Science, dealing with all the phenomena which attend upon, and the

principles which regulate the production, the distribution, and the exchange of

wealth. If they are qTiite unfamiliar with those inquiries, they may come preju-
Wediced against us as cold, and liard, and selfish.
                                                     deserve, gentlemen, no such

character. The considerations to which we call attention, the laws which we

point out, must be taken account of by the most humane and by the most imagina-

tive, if their attempts at world-bettering are not to shiver against the realities of

life. All human society, as has been well'said, rests on a material foundation, "and

beneath all systems of Government, and all schemes of public morality, there lies

the science of the wealth of nations." The laws which wo enunciate "are no more

and no less hard or imperative than unj of the laws with which other Sections

have to do. " What," asked Mr. Mill in the House of Commons last year, "is

more unfeeling than the attraction of gravitation ? " If, however, gentlemen, we

claim for Economic Science a very high place, we do not exaggerate its importance.

No wise economist ever pretended to explain more than a A'ery limited number of

the complicated problems of society and life?. No wise economist ever laid himself

open to the denunciations levelled by M. Edgar Quinet in his recent brilliant work

on the Ereuch Revolution against those who fondly fancy that they can account on

economical principles alone for that great moral and political earthquake. There

surely never was a time in which it was more plainly necessary to popularize this

Wescience.  are told by alarmists that cue of tLe results of Reform will be,

that many matters which were considered settled will be reopened, that Protec-

tion will again raise her head, and that the ghosts of old fallacies vnU come back

to gibber in the House of Commons. I am one of those who think such fears

wildly exaggerated ; but siu'ely the mere possibility of oiu* people lapsing into

heresies such as those which have seduced men of our race in America and Aus-

tralia should warn us to dift'use far and wide the broad results of Economic Science.

It is to be feared that, even in circles where we might expect better things, there

is a very considerable misconception about the real teachings of economists. AVho

can forget the opposition that was excited by Mr. Cobden's negotiations in France,

as if, forsooth, he of all men was going to be false to the principles by the advo-

cacy of which he had piut himself in the first rank of contemporary statesmen ? Is it

sm'prising that there should be so much hesitation about the acceptance, I do not

say of the mere fact of free trade, but of some of its consequences ? Count up the

schools in which an attempt is made at giving even a glimpse into Economic

Science. There are distinguished professors at both Oxford and Cambridge, but

how many men are there who leave the gi'eat English Universities with any

knowledge of it ? The Scottish Universities do very little for this peculiarly Scot-

tish science. I do not thinlc I am wrong in belieA'ing that no lectures on political

economy are ever delivered even in the most laborious and distinguished of Oxford

Colleges, the college of Adam Smith. Of the two economical questions to which

your President alluded last }ear, as to those which were, for the moment, chiefly

occupying the minds of men--the question of our coal supply, and the state of the

--money market the first will, no doubt, slumber till the report of the lioyal Com-

mission is given to the world. The other still attracts attention, but the " wheel

has come full circle," the periodical reaction has set in, and the vast pile of gold

mounts dailj' higher, waiting for the spirit of confidence to retm'u. Another econo-

mical question has, however, come in these last few months into great and painful

prominence. I allude, of course, to the question of Trades Unions, and to the rela-

tions of capital and labour. The unhappy contests between these natural allies is

not the only joint in our armour. Many eminent men have been declaring that

England is falhng behind other nations in the industrial race, and that a better

and more extended technical education has become a necessity. All attempts,

however, to give a good technical education will break down if we do not imitate

Switzerland and Germany in creating a really good system of elementary and

middle-class education. That is the soil in which technical education must grow,

and at present that soil is woefully thin in many places. Fortunately, however, the

public mind is becoming familiarized with the idea of an educational rate ; and

if we have an educational rate to assist the poorest, why not a system of gi'aded

schools to which all classes may repair if they see fit, and through which a ladder

may be built by which merit may climb to the high places of society. How long

will English farmers go on paying that the children of their labourers may be

educated better than their own ? Amongst the measures of the late session, in

which this Section may be supposed to take peculiar interest, was the extension

--to all trades of the principle of the Factory Acts these Acts which for more than

one generation wore so stoutly resisted in the name of Political Economy, but

which enlightened theory approves and which experience has justified. The

comparative ease with which the bills of last Session passed was creditable to the

Government, creditable to the interests affected, and, above all, creditable to Mr.

Henry Bruce, the Vice-President of the Council in the late Administration, whose

abnegation of self in the willing support which he ga\e to Bills with which his

own name will not be associated, was as remarkable as it is, I fear, rare amongst

politicians of any party. If it is ea.sy to give a definition of our work as students

of Economic Science, which, although, of course, liable to be pulled to pieces by

critics, may be taken as fairly correct, how different is the case with our work as

WhoStatisticians ?  can define Statistics ? " Quicquid agunt homines " in so far

as it is susceptible of being recorded and expressed numerically. That definition

might, perhaps, be accepted by some, but there would be many gainsayers. Two

sets of men long disputed as to which of them was most entitled to the name of

Statisticians, There were those who considered Statistics to be equivalent to what

used to he called " Political Arithmetic/' There -n-ere those who, appealing to the

etymology of the word Statistics, and recalling the history of the science, thought

that they", and they alone, were entitled to represent themseh-es as the successors

of the great Gottingen professors who first gave a systematic form to this kind of

inquiry. The victory has, for all practical pm-poses, remained -v^ath the first of these

two bodies of disputants ; that is to say, the science naturally tends to become
more definite and precise, to restrict itself more and more within the circle of those
facts which can be recorded and tabulated. The statistician has scarcely, perhaps,
had so many hard words thrown at him as his cousin the economist ; but he has
all along been coupled with that unpopular character in public disfavour. Those

who know nothing else of Mr. Bm'ke know his sentence about " sophists, econo-

mists, and calculators." I even remember seeing it quoted in a letter from an

innkeeper who had been remonstrated with on accoimt of an extortionate bill.

The statistician, however, no less than the economist, can say something in his
ovni justification. Have not vital statistics done much to diminish the uncertainty

in providing for families which used so mucli to increase the anxieties of the

trading and professional classes ? Have not sanitary statistics, even within the

last few years, added very much to the length and comfort both of civilian and

military life ? Have not judicial statistics done their part in leading the public to

?.ccept the doctrine at which the most enlightened criminalists had already arrived

--by other paths that crime is best repressed, not Ijy severe, but by rapid and certain

punishment ? Are not educational statistics at this very moment convincing all

intelligent persons in Great Britain that we must at length make "a long pull, a

strong pull, and a pull altogether," to get at least a modicum of education con-

veyed to the whole people ? And while I speak of educational statistics, it may

not be amiss to recall one curious instance of the want of them which was lately

Apressed on the attention of Parliament.  highlj^ intelligent witness from Oxford,

examined before the Committee which lately sat to inquire into the educational

system pursued at the two great English Universities, admitted that there was

not at this moment any official document in existence from which the public

--could arrive at an idea, even approximately correct, of the vast revenues of

Oxford and her colleges revenues which only required to be used in the spirit of
her worthier sons to make her incomparably the most efficient, as she is mcom-

parably the wealthiest, university in the world. Surelj' it is monstrous that wc

can v^-ith the greatest ease find the revenue and the expenditure of the University

of Berlin down to the last dollar, and are rmable to arrive at even a tolerable guess
as to the revenue and expenditure of a similar institution in our own island.

The importance of military and naval statistics need not be iirged. ^^'ould that

the most striking result of inquiries into them could be brought home to all minds !
Woultl that every one realized the fearful loss which the vast armaments now kept

up are entailing upon Europe ! Would that the people of this quarter of the glolv.j

would awake to the danger of being surpassed in all the arts of peace by the great

nation on the other side of the xitlantic ! .Vn American politician came back

last autumn fi'om Prussia, declaring that it was impossible to walk ten j'ards in a

Prussian town without meeting a soldier. An English politician came back at tlie

same time from the United States, declaring that he had traversed the country

from end to end without seeing even a single soldier. When will monarchs and

cabinets and popular assemblies learn that old wisdom of William III., that that

nation T^-ill hold the balance of power which, in proportion to its strength, " has

economized its material resom'ces to the highest point, and acquired the highest

degree of moral a.scendancy by an honest and consistent allegiance to the laws of

moralitj" in its domestic policy and in its foreign relations? " It woidd not be diffi-

cult to point out the obvious and palpable advaiUages that arise to the community          1

from other branches of statistical inquiry ; but, in ti-uth, there is no need, for cavil-

lers woidd be silent, if not convinced, were it not that our own friends sometimes

give an occasion to the enemy. To attempt to draw from staristical facts inferences

--which they will not bear to resolve the whole play of social forces into a mere
--question of numbers and averages to pretend that figures governed the world, in-

stead of merely helping us to understand how it is governed, is simply to iujiu-e the
cause which we profess to defend. Those who act in this way are almost as mis-

phievous as those whose reckless abuses of statistical methods have given point to

--the sueer that nothing is «o false as figures except facts the Rigbys of political

life, -who manipulate their figures with a view not to arrive at truth, but to obtain

a couti'oversial success. There is no poorer tiiimiph than such a one as this, for
there is none easier ; unless, indeed, it be the triumpli attained by fifth-rate theo-

logians when they quote isolated texts against each other, and each remains, in the

opinion of bis followers, the master of the unhonoured and improfitable field of

strife. It is, however, vain to argue against anything because it may be abused.
Of com-se, a man who deals with statistics, in the spirit of the saying, " Taut pis
pour les faits," can make them prove anything ; but surely no saying can be further
from being the expression of tlie temper of any man who has a right to call himself

a statistician. Perfect openness of mind, a determination to receive every fact ^^^th

equal favom-, a determination to restrain not only all the ordinary disturbing preju-

dices, but even that love of hasty generalization which is charactenstic of many fine

--intellects, a spirit resigned to collect, one by one, the stones of the temple which

a successor may build up, these are the marks of a true student of this science. I

have said something about popularizing economic science. Argninients not less

strong, though difterent, might be alleged in favour of popularizing statistics. It

is in this department that we shall find the real value of those men whose habits
of mind lead them to take what I may caU the old view of the science, the view
which foimd favour with Schlozer, when he said, " Statistics are history in repose

history is statistics in motion." The more the science, properly so called, Avith-
draws itself up the heights of knowledge, the more necessary will it be to have

messengers constantly passing to the plains below. It is satisfactory to see useful

manuals of statistics bemg gxadually multiplied and getting dovm into general cir-
culation. The historical ' Almanach de Gotha' has been mother of a numerous pro-
geny, amongst which not the least useful is the Belgian 'Annuaire' of Scheler, and
its younger sister in om- own coimtiy, the ' Statesman's Year Book.' It is strange

that, while France has in a kindred class of literature her excellent ' Aimuaire

des Deux Mondes,' and Germany her ' Europaischer Gelchichtskaleuder,' we have
nothing more cosmopolitan than our verj' parochial Annual Register. An idea
which was some years ago put forward in the ' Saturday Re^dew,' that it would
be expedient to bring out a series of politico-historical Companmns to Mr. Murray's

hand-books, has not yet been acted upon, but the realization of so reasonable a

project is surely only deferred. One of the greatest attractions of this science is
undoubtedly its" international character. The first impulse of a statistician who

has arrived'at what appear to him satisfactory results with regard to a group of
facts and tigm-es in his own country, is to see how his conclusions are affected by

similar groups of facts and figures in other coimtries. In so doing, he is necessarily

brought into connexion, not only ^vith foreigTi knowledge, but with foreign men of

activity and intelligence, and so becomes one more link in the chain that is binding

into om' great confederation the progressive nations of the globe. But I am for-

getting that I promised to adhere to the good custom of being brief. During the

next week we shall listen to many papers upon most important subjects, both in
our character of economists and statisticians. I trust we shall not only bring to
all an open and unprejudiced mind, but recollect the precept of the PjTrhonists, "Be
sober, and remember to doubt." Working in this spuit, we may perhaps square
a stone or shape a rafter which some future " master of those who know " may
use in building up a system of politics which may do as much honour to the nine-

 teenth century after, as did that of Ai'istotle to the fourth century before the

 Christian era.

0)1 Productive Labour in Prisons as associated with the Reformation of Cri-

                  minals. By Sir John Bowring, LL.D., F.li.S.

   The author read a paper, accompanied by the statistics of twenty-one prisons in
Great Britain, with the pui-pose of showing that profit-giving labour in gaols was

an all-important auxiliary for producing refoi-matiou among criminals. He stated

that the Act of Parliament in 186-3, which was intended to regidate all the prisons
of England, had left incredible incongruities, discrepancies, and contradictions in
                                                                  --

various localities, and under tlie difi'erent opinions and practices of visiting magis-

trates. He showed that the character of tlie law was far less influential than the

--mode of administration that the statistics of prisons have no uniform character,
--no common sj'stem of accountancy that the returns, when accessible, are fre-
--quently unintelligible that the amount of infliction and the mode of punishment

depend much more on the practice of the local magistracy than on the award of

the judges, and that parliamentary requirements are utterly inoperative where the

inefiiciency or resistance of prison ofliciaLs are associated with indiflerence, routine

Ahabits, or erroneous notions on the part of the justices.  committee, of which Sir

John was chairman, was established by order of the Coui-t of Quarter Sessions in

Devon, to ascertain whether, under the conditions of the existing Acts of Parlia-

ments, prison labour could be made remuneratory, and at the same time reforming.

The Devon County Prison presents one of the most remarkable instances of the

--utter waste of labour of the repudiation of labour as a means of instructing and
--moralizing the convict of the indiscriminating application of what is called the

deten-ent system iu aU its bitterness and severity groimded on the theory that the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

--criminal ought never to be the subject of pity, but only of pimishment that the

prison is to be no school where hope is to enter, but a solitude where trades are

-- --to be taught where industry is not to be encouraged where there is to be nothing

but isolation, profitless labour, and suffering. Coimtry justices have not been

remarljable for extreme sensitiveness ; but it might be expected that the desire to

lessen the county rates, by getting something out of the sweat of the misdemean-

ant, would luive some influence upon prison administration.

The committee circulated two series of questions, one general the other special.

The first was intended to elicit the opinions of those who had most attended to

questions of prison discipline as to the connexion between labour and reformation

--the action of the cellular system the use of the treadmill, and, generally, the prac-

ticability of making labour profitable under present parliamentary reqiuremeuts.

The second question was intended to elicit from various independent sources the

results exhibited by the different practices of different gaols.

The various returns attached to the Ileport of the De^on Committee invite com-

parisons and present contrasts which would seemimpossible (as they are incredible)

in a country subject to the same legislation, to the same inspectoral system, a country

of inquiry, and in which the topic of prison discipline lias been frequently discussed.

The simple truth is that the amount of independent action allowed to the county

--magistracy the inability of the central authority to cope with local influences
--the "independence" and "irresponsibility" of justices of the peace habits of
-- -- --routine love of power " esprit de corps " fear of innovation and other sinister

influences and interests have resisted reforms and maintained abuses to an extent

beyond tlie power of calculation. Take one illustrative fact as regards cost. In

the convict prisons of Scotland the annual expenses per head are £7 less than in

the convict prisons of England. Another as regards principle. In the sixty prisons

in Scotland there is not a single treadmill ; there is a unanimity of opinion uu-

friendlj' to its use. In the county of De\"on at this moment a treadmill is being

erected at an enormous cost, and with the declaration of the visiting justices, that

it is not believed any profit can be made fi-om it.

The cost of crime in prisons is considerably more than a million sterling per

annum ; the cost of crime out of prison is tenfold greater. The number of the

crimiual classes at large is thrice as great as that of the criminal classes in confine-

ment. In England the yearly net expense of the prisoner is more than double that

of France, more than treble that in the United States and in many of the best re-

gulated European prisons.

Prison discipline comes under two special heads, the vindictive and the refor-

matory                                      in other words, the instruments of pain and pleasure, of fears and hopes to
                                         ;

be applied to the eradication or diminution of crime. In some men the desire to

punish is stronger than the desire to reform ; in some the desire to reform is

stronger than the desire to punish. Sound policy would connect the employment

of both with a ^iew to maximiziug good and minimizing evil ; and labour is or

ought to be the instrument for accomplishing each of these praiseworthy objects.

Now, by the almost unanimous and emphatic consent of the highest authorities.

productive and profitable labovir is more reformatory than wasted labour. Sir
John Bowring brought overwhelming evidence of thi:i fact, derived from a variety
of sources, and from many parts of the world. It seems an almost universally
recognized principle that for short sentences labom- of the severest and least remu-
nerative character should be allowed ; that species of laboiu- should be only intro-
ductory to labour less irksome and more profitable. But however inviting, the field
of investigation is too wide, and the materials for judgment too multitudinous, to

allow of anything like an exhaustive exploration.

On the ShipbuUdhuj of Dundee. By Heney Gouelat.

   Shipbuilding has long been an important branch of industry in Dundee, and
even at the beginning of the present century the number of vessels built for
coasting and over-sea trade was considerable. All these vessels were, of course,

built of timber, and about the year 182-3 were all propelled by sails. The num-
ber and size of the vessels gradually increased, imtil about the year 185G, when
wooden shipbuilding in Dundee may be said to have reached its maximum. In
that year Messrs. Alexander Stephen and Son built the ' Eastern Monarch.' This

Avessel measured 1848 tons, b.m., was classed 14 years 1 in Lloyd's Begister,

and at the time was one of the largest, if not the largest, vessel afloat of this
high class. It is now nearly thirty years since iron shipbuilding was introduced
in Dundee. In the j-ear 1838 Messrs. James Cai-michael and Co. built an iron
paddle-steamer named the 'Caledonia,' intended for the river trafiic between Dun-
dee and Perth. The same firm also built a small iron schooner. These vessels

attracted considerable attention at the time, there being very few iron vessels
then afloat. After building these two vessels, Messrs. Camiichael discontinued

iron shipbuilding, but it was again taken up in 1840 by Mr. Peter Borrie, who

built several iron paddle-steamers. Between the years 1842 and 1854, no iron ships
were built in Dundee, and during this interval other j)orts had commenced, and
were carrying on the trade with vigour, so that, although Dundee was early in the
field, this advantage was lost. In 18o4,Messrs. Gom-lay Brothers and Co. commenced
to build vessels of iron, and since that time the trade has steadily increased, there

being now two firms which build entirely with iron, and one which uses iron for
the framework. The following Table will show the tonnage of the various kinds of
vessels that have been laimched in Dundee since the year 1861, and also the tonnage

138 REPOET 1867.

The value of the vessels represented by tliis tonnage is about £627,000 sterling, or

£104,500 anuuall}', exclusive of the machinery fitted on hoard the steamers. The

average number of men and boys employed iii the shipbuilding yards is about 910.

The materials of which the vessels are constructed are generally brought from a

distance. The iron comes from the north of England and Glasgow; the wood

(except the oak, which is grown in the neighbourliood) from the Baltic, America,

and India. The chains and anchors are generally manufactiu-ed in Newcastle,_but

the sailcloth and cordage are produced in Dundee. The cost of the carriage of iron

and coal is a disadvantage that the Dundee shipbuilder labours under ; but it is not

a very serious obstacle, as these materials can be carried at a cheap rateby water,

and there are advantages to compensate, so that there is no reason why shipbuilding

may not be largely carried on in Dimdee. Iron as a material for shipbuilding is

here, as elsewhere, to a  large extent talring the place  of wood for we find that in
                                                                                                       ;

185.3 there were no iron ships building in Dundee, but for the last six years the

tonnage of the iron vessels has not been far short of the wooden ones, whilst there

is nearly double the tonnage of iron vessels on hand that there is of wooden ones.

--On tJie various MetJiods in which our coinage may he Decimalized the Advan-

      tages and Disadvantages of each. Bg F. P. Fellows, F.S.A., F.S.S.

This paper, after discussing the general principles that should guide us in choosing

for adoption any methods of decimalizing our coinage, described at length the

various plans that had been proposed.

WeFirst.  could at once decimalize our money by adopting the American plan

of coining apiece eqiml to 100 haltiDence, or or4>.'. 2f/., a dollar; the halfpenny

being equal to an American cent, and the 100 halfpence the dollar.

   This would be a very simple method, but the objections to it were, that the
halfpenny was too high for our lowest coin (the lartliing being much used by our

poorer classes), and the doUar of As. 2d. was not sufficiently high for our largest

coin.

 --Secondly. There was what was commonly called the penny, tenpenny, and

hundredpt'nuy scheme 1 penny being the unit or smallest coin, and lOOrZ. or
8s. id. the largest. The same objections applied to this as to the halfpenny and

dollar scheme, and if we are to express farthings and halfpence, we still retain

vulgar fractions. It had been suggested that the penny might be divided into ten
parts, and also that by a slight ch.mge in value, this would bring our system into

accord with French francs and centimes ; the centime being equal to nearly the
-^Lth of a penny, and the lOd. to a franc. The evils and difficulties of this
scheme were entered upon, and it was maintained tliat tlio tenth of a penny was
too low for our lowest coin, and would cause an imnecessary number of figures

to be written down.

   The third scheme discussed, proposed to commence at the half sovereign ; the
shilling being the tenth, the shilling being again divided into ten parts, and the

tenth of a shilling again decimally subdivided ; the lowest unit being the ||ths

of the half farthing.

   The difiiculties of the introduction of this scheme were stated to be the same
as those of the poimd and mil scheme, -which was next discussed.

   The fourth plan, viz. the pound and mil scheme, proposed to retain the present
sovereign, and to consider that, as now, the liighest coin of account. Thus wo

should have the present pound, the fiorin as the tenth of the pound, a coin of
the value of the tenth of a fiorin (between 2\d. and 2hJ.), and the lOOOth of a

pound, being ffths of the present farthing.

    This system woidd disarrange and throw out all our present copper coinage,
and the burden of the change would consequently be thrown mainly upon the poorer
and least educated classes, and therefore the least able to understand the new

system, or to accommodate themselves to it. Eespecting the ti-ansition period, it

was shown that the change wovdd be nearly as diihcidt as to inti'oduce an enth-ely
new coinage ; for that out of the 960 sums that could be paid from one farthing
to a pound, only forty, or about 4 per cent , could possibly oe paid with the new

coinage ; and out of the 1000 sums from one mil to one pound in the new system,
only 40, or 4 per cent., could be paid with our present coins. The only sums that
could possibly be paid with both the old and new money, woidd be Gd., Is., Is. 6(7.,

and so on, by sixpences to a pound ; none of the intermediate sums, from ^d. to

5|f?., from (5jf/. to lljf/., could be paid with new coins; and the same difficulties

would occur in paying new coinage sums with old money, the present 6f/. being
25 new mils, and 24 present farthings. This difficulty was of great moment and

aiFected most of the Government departments, as, for instance, the Customs,

Excise, and Postage duties based on our copper coinage, that is, on the ^d., \d.

or \d. Thus the Post-office would have to alter its charge for letters, and if

(taking its gross receipts at £5,000,000) it decided to charge 4 mils instead of Id.

as now, it must consent to lose £200,000 yearly, the circidatiou remaining the

same or                     if it  charged 5 mils, then this would be equivalent to an additional tax
                         ;

on the people of £1,000,000 yearly.

The same difficulties applied to bill stamps, receipt stamps, to railway, road,

canal, and other tolls, and many Acts of Parliament relating to railway, canal,

and other companies would have to be modified. It was shown that all the

manufacturer's price lists, both for paying their workmen, and for selling from their

books of engravings with printed prices attached, would have to be reprinted, that

litigation and strikes with the men would probably ensue, and that it would be

a veiy heavy tax on the manufactiu-ers of this countr3% It was urged that it was

unwise to import all these difficulties in addition to those that were inherent on

the mere change itself to a decimiil system.

The author then pointed out that it was antagonistic to true decimalization to

begin at the highest coin, and to call that the unit. The imit, like our numeration,

should be the commencement of the system, and like it should begin with units,

go on to tens, then to hundreds, and on to thousands.

The author then went on to say, "I now proceed to describe a system which I

think overcomes the objections and difficulties I have mentioned as affecting the

various schemes under consideration.

   " In the first place, by the plan I advocate" we get rid of vulgar fractions, \d., \d.,

%d. The unit begins at the proper point, viz. the lowest necessary coin, the

Wefarthing.                        can retain in use during the transition period all the coins we now

Wehave.                     could use and write down either the present, or the proposed new

coinage, in pounds, shillings, and pence, as we do now, or decimally. No change

need be made in trading or in Government transactions. Those who chose could

keep their accoimts as now, even if thej' received the new coinage ; and those
who chose to keep their accounts decimaUy, could do so, and coidd still enter

decimally the old coinage amounts they received.
   " It begins at the farthing. It has been before suggested to begin at the farthing,

but the system proposed has some novelties. I would then boldly at once call

things by their right names, especially when these names will correctly denote the

relation each coin bears to the rest, and when these designations wiU greatly

facilitate the introduction of the decimal system.

" I would make a coin of the value of

                                 1 Farthing, and caU it                   1 imit.

cent. 7. That the number of persons committed for trial for indictable offences in
Scotland is greater in proportion than in England and Ireland ; and though she
shows less propensity to offences against property, she stands in an unfavourable

--position as to offences against the person. In ten years, 1857-6G, the average

number of persons committed vras, in England 09.38 per 1000, in Scotland I'll per
1000; and in L-eland 0-990 per 1000 of the population. The offences against the

--person were, in England 12-10 per cent., in Scotland 29-4-3 per cent., and in Ire-
--laud .37-31 per cent. The offences against property without violence were, in

England 74 per cent., in Scotland 48 per cent., and in Ireland 34 per cent. 8.

That the common assimiption that Scotland consumes more spirits than England
is unfounded, when the quantity of spirits in all spirituous beverages consumod is
taken into account ; and though we may congi-atulate ourselves on the diminished

consimiption of gin and whiskjs there is reason for warning in the fact that such
diminution is more than counterbalanced by the greater quantity of spirits con-
sumed in the other beverages, principallj- ale and wine. In 1866 the total quantity
of spirits consumed in gin and whisky, brandy, beer, wine, cider, &c., was in the pro-
portion of 4-437 gallons per head in England, 2-984 gallons per head in Scotland,

--and 1-631 gallon per head in Ireland. Of British and foreign spirits there were

consimied, in England 0-864 gallon, in Scotland 1-847 gallon, and in Ireland
0-857 gallon per head. Of spirits in beer, 3-.393 gallons per head in England,
1-050 gallon per head in Scotland, and 0-710 gallon per head in Ireland. Between
1857 and 1866 there was an increase in the consumption of spirits thus calculated
of 12i per cent, in England, 23 per cent, in Scotland, and 8 per cent, in Ireland.

capital deposited in the Sa^vings' Banks, the amount per head in Scotland was

ger traffic on the British railways in 1865 was in the proportion of 23,400 per mile

--in England, 10,000 in Scotland, and 7200 in Ireland the proportion travelling by

third-class being 76-41 per cent, in Scotland, 58-66 per cent, in England, and 56-86
per cent, in Ireland. 12. That the number of letters delivered by the Post-office
was in the proportion of 28 per head in England, 21 per head in Scotland, and
10 per head in Ireland ; or in the proportion of 47, 36, and 17 per cent, respectively.

13. That, as a whole, Scotland appears to be advancing rapidly, her position in the

United Kingdom being of considerable importance ; whilst, if we add that in pro-
portion to the number of her people she has contributed, and does contribute, a large
share of eminent statesmen, lawyers, military officers, men of science, and merchant
princes, we cannot resist the conclusion that the Scotch possess in a high deoree

that energy of character, persistency of will, and boldness in action which have
rendered Britain supreme among the nations of the world.

               On the Ohstacles to the Utilization of New-Zealand Max.

                   By W. Latidee Lindsay, M.D., F.E.S.E., F.L.S.

   The atithor's propositions are based on
   1. The residts of obseiTations made during a tour in New-Zealand in 1861-62.

2i That in Eni-ope alone there is practically an w«limited demand for this class of

fibre.

   8. That in order to such fibre as New-Zealand flax becoming marketable,

          A. The supply must be both regular and large.
         B. The quality must equal that of the fibres which at present command

                   the market.

          C. The cost of production must be such as to leave a considerable niargin of
                  profit on its market price.

   4. That hence any candidate for preference in the fibre market must submit to be
rigorously tested by the following standards :

         A. Amount and regularity of supply.

B. Quality.

          C. Market price.
   Theutilizationof New-Zealandflaxhasbeen stimulated in evei-y conceivable way.

by the self-interest of colonists and colonial governments ; by the attraction of sub-
stantial government rewards ; by the high prices offered in the British market for

good samples of dressed fibre ; by industrial exhibitions throughout the world, includ-

Newing Zealand itself ; by the perennial encoiu'agements of the local press. So
long ago as 1856, the general government of New Zealand offered premiimis to the

extent of £4000 for the production of a marketable fibre ; the provincial government
of Canterbury subsequently offered a bonus of £1000 with the same object ; and
still more recently, that of Otago has promised a honorariimi of £500 for the pro-
duction of a marketable paper from New-Zealand flax, or other indigenous fibre.

None of these premiums has yet been gained. Infinite have been the experiments
instituted, the patents talcen out, the efforts made to produce a marketable fibre

while at least one special book, printed moreover appropriately on New -Zealand flax-

made paper, has been devoted to the subject. Nevertheless no prooress has been
made beyond the products of the crude art and hand-labom- of the Maori with his
simple mussel or cockle shell ; if, indeed, his results have been rivalled by the best
specimens of colonial art. The endeavour to give New-Zealand flax a permanent
and satisfactory place in Em-opean commerce has hitherto been a signal failure.

  --The authors object is to discuss the causes of this failm'e to indicate the combi-

nation of circumstances that has hitherto operated in preventing the practical appli-

cation in the textile arts of a fibre acknowledged by all authorities to possess a high

value.

   The author's main propositions are the following :
   I. Ajnoimt and regularity of supply.

          A. There cannot be a sufficiently large or regular supply to meet the require-
                  ments, either of the local or European market, till

             1. The plant is systcmaticalh/ cultivated.
             2. Labour is more abimdant and cheaper.

          B. It remains to be determined by experiment on the large scale :

       --1. What are the most suitable forms and circumstances of cultivation in

                      reference especially to such practical and important points as («) the
                      kind of soil, and (J) the artificial aids to growth.

           2. What are the methods of cultivation most suitable to those Botanical

                     species or varieties which possess the finest quality of fibre.

           3. What is the best time for cutting down and preparing the leaf.

li. Quality of the fibre.

      A. ^^aries in different s;jec2Vs oi Phonnium and different varieties of P. tenax.
             But it has yet to be detei-mined what species or varieties yield the finest
                 qualities of fibre, whether in the

a. Cultivated, or                                                                 ,  ,
                                                                               |

B. Is improved by cultivation.

This has long been recognized by the Maoiies, who cultivate, solely for

its fibre, the New-Zealand flax plant as carefully as they do their

maize or potato as food-plants.

III. Cost of production and market value.

The present scarcity and high value of labour in New Zealand render the cost

midof collecting tlie  flax plant, of preparing the fibre, and of transporting it

to seaports too great to enable the colonist to offer dressed liax in the European

market at a price nearly equal to that of Russian tlax and other similar fibres,

with which it must compete.
   The cost of proper cultivation of the plant and proper preparation of the fibre

imder present circimistances would be still greater.

IV. Suitable processes, chemical and mechanical, hare yet to be devised for

dressing, bleaching, and dyeing the fibre.

  It has been obviously a common error of experimentalists to conclude that the

processes and machineiy, which have proved successful in preparing other fibres,

should be equally suitable and successful here.

   V. Not only has New-Zealand ilax to compete with many fibres of established

reputation, which are easily and cheaply produced in countries where laboiu' is

abimdant ; not only, as regards paper-making, must it enter the market against
rags and other waste products of ciAdlization, which are necessarily greatly cheaper

than a di-essed fibre : but it will have to compete with himclreds of fibres of equal,
or nearly equal, value, which abotmd in all our warmer colonies, and occui- gene-

rally throughout temperate and warm parts of the world, whose applications will be

developed in proportion as colonization progresses, and as chemistry and mechanics

are brought to bear on processes suitable for their preparation*.

  W. Labour is likely to become cheaper and more abundant in other colonies
than New Zealand, which are quite as rich in fibre-producing plants, whUe the difii-

culties attending the separation and dressing of the fibre will probably be more

speedily overcome in the case of these other plants and fibres.

\TI. Thereis therefore no good ground for the toosanguine anticipations of colonists

and colonial governments as to the future high value of New-Zealand flax as an

article of colonial exjiort. Present data merely afford encouraging grounds for ex-

periment.

yni. One of the most hopeful directions of experiment is the Acclimatizatioti of

the New-Zealand flax plant in countries suited for its gTowth, where labour is

cheaper and the advantages of chemical and mechanical skill are more readily

obtained.

--Employer and Employed Capital and Lc(bour, By Pateick Maithew;

                On tJie Confectionery and Marmcdade Trade of Dundee,

                                By Charles C. Maxwell.

   It is between sixty and seventy years since Dxmdee marmalade was first manu-
factured as an article of commerce by the late Mr. James Keiller, and then merely
to supply the local and district demand. Gradually, however, the area of its sale
extended, not only throughout Scotland, but into England and Ireland, imtU now,
when it may be said that the whole British Isles, a considerable portion of the Con-
tinent, and even our most distant colonies, are supplied with it. To give an idea
of the extent of this trade, the author stated that the quantity of marmalade made
in Dundee at the present time amounts to above 1000 tons annually, for the pro-
duction of which more than 3000 chests, equivalent to 6000 boxes, of the finest
bitter oranges are used. These are imported from Seville, as it has been foimd
that the oranges grown in and around that city possess a peculiar and agreeable
aroma, which renders them better adapted for the pm-pose than those of any other
distiict either in Spain or Italy. "When the marmalade is prepared, a sufficient
quantity of sugar is added, to preserve it thoroughly, without in any degi'ee im-
pairing the flavour. The author stated that about fom- bundred persons are directly
employed at the Dundee confectionery works, and occupation is furnished to many
others in connexion will; them. For example, one of the Newcastle potteries is
to a large extent engaged in turning out the well-known printed jars for marma-

   * Investigations made in 1858 led the author to the conclusion that fibre-producing
plants abound throughout all parts of the world that support a phanogamic vegetation at
all rich or varied : Vide " Substitutes for Paper Material," Scottish Eeview, October 1858
and January 1859.
                                                                                         ;

lade. Of these there are about one and a lialf million required every year, costing
upwards of £6500. The marmalade season, as it may be called, that is the period
during which all that is required of this preserve for the year's supply must be
made, usually continues about four months, viz. from the beginning of December
to the end of March. The author mentioned that the word " marmalade," is
supposed to be derived from an Indian fruit not unlike the orange, called the

^ijle mannehs, or Indian Bael, from which, at one period, a similar consei-ve
seems to have been made. Besides orange marmalade, other preserves from

fruit are extensively manufactured in Dundee, considerable quantities of fruit
being grown in the neighbourhood, although far from sufficient to supply the de-
mand. The manufacture of confections is also carried on on a very large scale, and

embraces an immense variety of lozenges, comfits, candied peels, &c. The author

stated that, in most of the processes connected with the production of these, care-

fully-constructed steam-machinery is now successfully employed ; and the result

is a degree of finish, quality, and cheapness which hand-labour could never have
attained. The quantity of sugar, chietly refined, used for the confections, marma-

lade, and preserves, made in Dundee, it would be difficult to estimate ; but it pro-

bably amounts to 2000 tons annually.

   It may be asked whether this is a healthful occupation to the persons engaged in

it ; and that question can, it is believed, be confidently answered in the affirmative.
It has been ascertained that working among sugar and fruit is not injurious

to health, but the reverse, especially when care is taken that the], temperature in

the work-rooms is duly equalized and cleanliness and ventilation constantly at-

tended to.

   The author enumerated the firms engaged in the production of steam-engines,
general millwiight work, and spinning, weaving and cloth-finishing machinery.
The invention of the fan blast or blowing machine, for heating and melting
iron, by Messrs. James Carmichael and Co., of Ward Foundry, was described at
length, and the invention of a marine reversing gear by the same firm was also

referred to.

  A photogi-aph of the first locomotive, made in 183.0 for the Dundee and New-

   The author next described the invention of the air-engine by the Messrs.

Stirling, and concluded his paper with an account of the early engineering and

millwright work in Dundee, and statistics of mill-machinery.

On the Prevalence of " Spedalske," or Leprosy, in the Kinr/dom of Norway. By
   HENRi' J. Ker Porter, M.B.I.A., Member of the Philosopihical Society of
   New South Wales.

During a tour in Norway last year (1866), the author visited the Leper Hospitals

at Molde and Eergin, and learned that the disease is incurable. Although the

disease is neither infectious or contagious, one naturally shrinks from contact with

these poor sufferers. Many of the patients whom the author saw were similarly

affected to those seen by him at Calcutta and around the outer walls of Jerusalem.

Some, whose  fingers  were  contracted, were  quite  devoid  of  feeling in their hands
                                                                                                                                                                       ;

others were suffering from tubercular leprosj'. lie was assured by the resident

Governor at INIolde that there were many truly religious persons amongst those

patient sufferers. Those who had the use of their hands were occupied in making

fishing-nets, or preparing fine cord for that purpose. The disease is hereditary

and though it will occasionally pass over one or two generations, it will appear in

a second or third one. Few will be prepared to learn that in Norway there are

above 2000 lepers, as will be seen from the following abstract from the official

returns furnished to the Government.

   This report contains in detail the statistics and past progress of every department
under the Government, and gives a perspicuous and authoritative statement of the
French Empire up to February 1867, in all its political, commercial, and social rela-
tions, everywhere testifying to progress, and to a gradual relaxation of the old cen-
tralizing system, and to opening up in a liberal spirit commercial intercourse with

foreign countries ; the prosecution of geographical research in different parts of the

world, and the patronage of literary and scientific objects at the public expense, is
very marked.

On the Popidation and Mortalitg of Calcutta. BgF.M. Tait, F.S.S., F.R. G.S.

   After describing Calcutta, the metropolis of British India, the author gave some
interesting statistics, chiefly taken from a report in the census of Calcutta for the
year 1866, and signed by A. M. Dowbans, Vice-Chairman of the Justices of the
Peace for the town of Calcutta. The population of Calcutta is estimated at 377,924,
and in 1850 the population was estimated, from a survey made at the time, at
353,567. Great difiiculty was experienced in getting up the last census, in conse-
quence of the prejudices of the natives, but these were eventually overcome and a
pretty correct approximation was got. There were 58,892 houses in Calcutta when
the census was taken. The population of Calcutta is distributed as follows :

Europeans, 11,224; Mussulmans, 113,059 ; Hindus, 2.39,190 ; the remaining popu-

lation is made up of Eurasian Greeks, Armenians, Asiatics, Jews, Parsees, Africans,
and Chinese. The suburbs of Calcutta are estimated at 250,000, making the grand
population of Calcutta not imder 629,924. The highest age attained in reference
to each class was Eiu-opeans, 87; Em-asians, 104; Armenians, 84; Jews, 88;
Musulmans, 100; and the Hindus, 116. The mortalit}^ of Calcutta, according to
creeds, is Christians, 5-19 ; Hindus, 6'41; Mussulmans, 5-83. From a report by

the health officer of the Census Committee, it appears that there were in 1865, 304
deaths amongst an aggregate European population of 11,224, the mortality being

thus at the rate of 2- /I per cent, But these figures should be taken with reserve,

as few Eiu-opeaus remain to die in Calcutta. That which materially swells the

mortality of Calcutta is the death-rate prevailing amongst common soldiers and

sailors who go ashore into Lall Bazaar and other places of resort, and drinldng

arrack and other vile compouuds, staggering out and remaining in the open air all
night, thus briug on almost certain death. In conclusion, the following is the

death-rate per cent, per annum amongst various classes in India according to dif-
ferent authorities :--Bengal military, from 1800 to 1847 (Nelson), 2-40 ; Madras

militarv, from 1808 to 1840 (Davies), 3-28 ; jMadi-as militaiy, from 1808 to 18.57

(Brown), 3'11; European soldiers, from 1800 to 18.56 (Farr), 6-68; Eurasians,
from 1837 to 1851 (Tait), 2-47. In estimating a comparison of European mor-

tality in India, an essential element is the period of time embraced in the obser-

\'alions. Thus the death-rate dming the first quarter, or even half, of the present
Acentury, is no just criterion for future guidance.
                                                     great change for the better

has taken place within the last ten years, and Englishmen may now settle in India

with much less cause for apprehension than prior to the era of railways and the

establishment of the overland route.

           On the Linen Manufacture in Dundee and its Neighhourhood.
                                    By Alexandee J. Waedex.

   In Dundee the linen manufacture now embraces cloth made of jute, as well as of
flax, and both fabrics are called " linen." Linen was made in Egypt at a very

remote period, and the manufactiu-e descended from that wondrous land through
Greece, Rome, and Flanders to Britain. In Scotland the linen manufacture was

for many ages of an entirely domestic character, and it extended over the length
and breadth of the country. Dundee engaged in the linen manufacture "a long

time ago ;" and since the iutroduction of mill -spinning, about 1790, if not before,
it has been the great seat and centre of the linen trade of Scotland. Until about a
centmy ago the material chiefly spun was flax of native gTO-ni;h ; but foreign flax

then began to be imported into Dundee, principally from Russia, and now almost

the whole of the flax consumed hi that town and neighbourhood is from that
country. About 18,30, a new fibre, of Indian gi'owth (jute), began to be used, and

though it made little way for a time, it rose in favour as it became better known,
and now it is the great staple of the town. The rapid increase in the consump-
tion of this fibre is remarkable. In 183G it was 300 tons ; in 1846, 0200 ; in 1856,

31,000; in 1866, 62,000; and this year (1867) it will exceed 65,000 tons, or about

·500,000 bales. The consumption of flax in Dundee has not varied much for the past
few years, it being about 24,000 tons, and of hemp 1000 tons, making a total of

90,000 tons per annum. lu the district around Dundee, about 37,000 tons of flax,
2000 of hemp, and 1000 of jute, in all 40,000 tons, are consumed annually. The

total consumption of flax, jute, and hemp in and around Dundee is now, therefore,
about 130,000 tons yearlv. " The cost of the raw material used in Dundee is about

£2,.500,000, and in' the "district around £1,750,000; together, £4,250,000._ This
material is spun into yarn, and the gi'eater part of the yarn is woven into linen in

the district. The total annual value of these commodities exported from the town
and district is estimated at £8,000,000. The nominal horse-power, number of spin-

dles and power-looms, and the number of persons employed in the spinning-mills
and power-loom factories in Dundee and in the district around, and also in the

other parts of Scotland, at 1st September 1867, were as follows, viz.

In addition to the persons employed in the mills and factories^ there are about

20,000 people engaged in hand-loom weaving, &c., and in the auxiliary branches

of the linen trade in Dundee, and perhaps 10,000 in the other districts, making the

total number of persons engaged in the linen manufacture of Scotland considerably

to exceed 100,000. The capital invested in the mills and factories, and in the bleach-

works, calenders, and other auxiliary branches of the linen manufacture of Dundee

and district around, buildings, and machinery, is about £6,000,000, and in the other

parts of Scotland £1,000,000 ; together, £7,000,000. The average value of the

stock in trade in the bauds of importers, manufacturers, and exporters is estimated

at £5,000,000. The total capital required to carry on the linen manufactiu'e of Scot-
land is therefore £12,000,000. The linens made comprise many fabrics, from the

finest shirtiugs, sheetings, and damask, through all qualities of dowlas, osnabm'gs,

spriggs, padding,- ducks, sailcloth, hessians, sacking, bags, bagging, cai'peting, iloor-

cloth, &e., to tlie coarsest mending and nail bagging. The mills and factories,

especially those erected in Dundee within the past few j-ears, are palatial structures,

unsurpassed in extent or solidity by any which have j'etbeen constructed elsewhere,

and the machinery is as perfect as human ingenuity and money can make it. The

various floors are lofty and thoroughly ventilated, and every modern appliance is

taken advantage of to render the works salubrious and healthy, and to lessen the

Alabour and increase the comfort of those employed.  visit to one of these works

On the Measure and Value of Oafs. By A. Stephen "Wilsok,

Seasons why the Office of Warden of the Standards should include Standard
    Weujhts and Measures of the Metric Si/stem in addition to those of the

   Imperial Weights and Measures. By James Yates, F.E.S.

   The office of Warden of the Standards was created by an Act of Pai'liament passed
in August 1860, called the " Standards of Weights, Measm'es, and Coinage Act."
Its provisions were in accordance with the previous recommendations of the Com-

mission for the Restoration of the Standards (1841), of the Astronomer Royal (1859),

and of the Select Committee of the House of Commons (1862). Its main pm-port

was, that a distinct department of Weights and Measm-es should be established in

connexion with the Board of Trade, and that it shoidd be imder the control of a

warden, or chief officer, whose business shoidd be to compare standards brought for
verification, to watch the legislation and practice in our own country, and the
course followed in other countries, to provide the standards and other apparatus

required for scientific pm'poses, and, when necessarj', to memorialize the Treasury
on the steps which ought to be taken. First Heport of Warden of the Standards, 1807,
p. 15. But, although at the time when this Act was passed the measures and
weights of the Metric System were legaUzed, no provision was made for its use.

Hereupon the author of this paper observes :

   "The gradual extension of the use of the Metric System in this country, leading
on to its general adoption, as anticipated by the Committee of the House of Com-

mons, shows the necessity of making the same provision for it as for the Imperial

Weights and Measiu-es. Metric weights and measures are now made in consider-

able quantities by English manufacturers, especially in London, Birmingham, and

Sheffield. Many of these articles are exported to countries in which the Metric
System has been long and exclusively established. With increasing facilities for
the manufacture of them, it may be expected that they will form an important
branch of our foreign trade. London tradesmen are greatly disappointed to find
that the IMetric Weights and Measures Act does not protect them iu using Metric
weights and measures. The manufacturers of such weights and measures apply in
vain at the proper offices to have them tested. There is consequently great uncer-

tainty and liability to fraud in their use, even although "the length of a metre

and its subdivisions should be marked upon the same bar T\ath the standard yard."
                                                                                                         10*
--148 REPORT 1867.

This does not make a provision by wliicli all persons may test the accuracy of

their linear measures, and it leaves "the weights and the measures of capacity out of

the question.
   After further insisting on the necessity for additional pro\-isions for the use of

the Metiic System, he says, that if the neAvly appointed Standard Commissioners
" will pursue' the task, which they hare well begun, in an enlightened, patriotic,
and generous spirit, striving to carry out the recommendations of the Committee

of the House of Commons, and thus to insh-uct the people in the principles of the
svstem, and gradually to introduce it into the various departments of Government,

--if they persevere in this course, it will be foimd that the change will be gladly
and thankfully accepted from any Administration which shall have the wisdom and

the happiness to introduce it."

   The author says that the Committee of the House of Commons " studied the

subject under every important aspect, and after a long, laborious, and most intelli-
gent inquiry, decided unanimously to recommend the introduction of the Metric
System in the Post-office, in levying the Custom duties, in Government contracts,
ill the examinations for the Civil Service, in all schools receiving gi-ants of public
money, and in all statistical documents ; and they foresaw that, by adopting these
prelirninary measures, and by instructing the people in its principles and practice,
the Government would prepare for its universal acceptance. Although the Govern-
ment has not yet taken action in this direction, yet the system has been constantly

making progress by the action of the people themselves."

The author then shows that England is lamentably behind other countries in

promoting this great reform, which must, nevertheless, proceed even in this

country.

"my"It "is," says he,  sincere desire that the recently appointed Standard Com-

missioners may be the honoured instruments of introducing and expediting this

Mygreat change. "  reason is, that I do not think the Government could have made

a better appointment." He mentions their names and qualifications, and concludes

by expressing his opinion that they were chosen on account of their past services,

their eminence as men of science, and their official and social distinction. He trusts

that they would not decline the honom-able labour, to which the present proposal
would invite them, and hopes that the British Association for the Advancement

of Science and the International Decimal Association would continue their assis-
tance, and that this popular agency would combine with that of a more official
character to accomplish the scheme recommended by the Committee of the House

of Commons.

Notes on Seal- and Whale-FisJdngs as prosecuted hy the North-Sea Fleet,

                     Jutilinf/ from Dundee. By J.^mes Yeamax.

   This paper was devoted to the description of an important branch of industry pro-
secuted at Dundee, to provide a necessary ingredient to render jute applicable or

workable into its varied appliances.
   "Whale fishing has been prosecuted in Britain since the beginning of the sixteenth

century. Acts of the Legislature were passed for its encouragement, and bounties
were paid by the Government to the adventurers, both on the tonnage of the ships
and for the tons of oil and bone landed in British ports. During the reign of James
YI. of Scotland and of England Acts were passed by the Imperial Parliament to
encourage the trade. Its seamen were exempt from impressment for naval service,

and bomities on the produce were granted. From the year 1733 to the end of 1785
these bounties amounted for England to £-1,064,000, "and for Scotland £202,000;
the officially declared value of the whale-fisheries imported into England in the

forty-one years included between 1760 and 1800 being £2,144,387.
    Fish-oit was at that time applied to various purposes, but the chief object was oil

for illumination.

   The discovery of coal-gas had the effect of lessening the demand for fish-oil, and
consequently of the nmnber of ships employed in the North-Sea fisheries ; and al-
though never wholly abandoned, the trade dwindled for many j-ears, and only re-
vived when the use of jute, a fibre manipulated mider the action of fish-oil, created
a new era in the manufacture and production of many useful and ornamental fabrics.

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  149

   Dundee first engaged in the whale-fislieiy towards the close of the last century,
and had eight vessels employed in it in 1814, varying in size from 270 to upwards of
300 tons burden. The pursuit had proved profitable, as in the year 1839 ten ships
were engaged, but from that date for nineteen years the success appears to have

varied, the number employed then being reduced to four.
   In 1858 the late Mr. William Clark had the full-rigged ship, the 'Tay,'_of

above 600 tons register, converted into an auxiliary steam-screw whaler, being
the first successful introduction of steam power into the piu'suit from the port

of Dundee.

   Next year two new auxiliary screw-steamers, the ' Dundee ' and ' Narwhal,'

were built expressly for the seal- and whale-fishing. These tine vessels proved
the superiority of steam over sail-ships for prosecuting the North-Sea seal and

whale fisheries ; and since then, through local enterprise and energy, several new

powerful steam-whalers have been built, and several sail-ship whalers have been

converted into screw-steamers, and added to the Arctic fleet, there being now

twelve full-rigged auxiliary screw-steamers of from 400 to 600 tons register em-
ployed at the Greenland Seal and Davis Straits Whale fisheries, and no sailing-
sliip in the trade from Dundee, Dimdee ranking foremost in her steam-whale fleet
of the ports of Em-ope or America. The value of this fleet, with full equipments

for a season's fishing, with the requisite boiling &c. premises at port on shore, may

be roundly estimated at £200,000, and the gToss worth of a successful seal- and
whale-fishing at £120,000. Fishing by steam is more costly than by sail-ships
but as two voyages can be made in one year by steam, one to the sealing at Green-
land and a second to whaling at Davis Straits, with greater facilities, the extra

expense is more than counterbalanced.
   To accomplish the double voyages, vessels must leave Dimdee for the seal-

fishing in Greenland waters about the 1st of March, returning to port to dis-

charge their cargoes about the 25th of May ; and again sail for whaling at Davis
Sti-aits, after being from six to ten days in harbour, as may be required, to dis-

charge the produce of the sealing voyage, and to recoal.

    Each ship is equipped with eight fishing row-boats about twenty-five feet
long, and is manned with sixty-five to eighty hands for the seal-captures, and

fifty to sixty for whaling.

   The capture of 3000 seals is considered good work of a ship's crew in a day,
but stormy weather renders the numljer which may bo secured very uncertain.

   The whale-fishing at Greenland and Spitzbergen is now seldom prosecuted by

Dimdee ships, that at Davis Straits being prefon-ed.

It is well known that the most important part of the proceedings at the Annual

Meetings of the British Association consists in receiving reports of scientific re-

searches made dm-ing the previous year, and planning those to be made diu-ing
the ensuing year, whether by observation and experiment, or by collecting and
arranging existing information. The proposals for such researches originate in the
Committees of the several Sections, are then considered by the Committee of Re-
commendations, and are finally sanctioned by the General Committee ; and the re-

ports of them are read to the Sections with whom the proposals originated. I think
it may be useful on the present occasion to lay before the Meeting a brief summary

of the researches which have been made or recorded at the instance of the Mecha-
nical Section since 1850. As that was the year in which 1 became a member of the
Association, I will refrain fi'om extending the summary to earlier years, because
that duty would be better performed by some member who took part in the pro-

 ceedings of those years.

150 REPORT--1867.

--Strength of Materials. This subject lias obtained, as its importance deserves, a

large share of the attention of the Section. The following are the reports which

--the Section has received, and the dates of the meetings at which they were read :

1. Mechanical Properties of Metals as derived from frequent Meltings, 1853.

2. Tensile Sti-ength of Wrought Iron at different Temperatures, 1856. 6. Resis-

tance of Iron Tubes to Collapse, 1857, 1858. 4. Eesistauce of Glass Globes and

Cylinders to Collapse, 1858. 5. Eflect of Vibratory Action and Long-continued

Changes of Load on Wrought-Irou Gu-ders, 1860," 1861. Those five reports are

the work of Dr. Fairbairn                                                                                                                         and they contain solutions  of questions of the highest
                                                                                                                                               ;

importance, practical as well as scientific. The third of them, in particular, con-

--tains the discovery of a new law in the strength of materials that which connects

the resistance of a flue to coUapse with its thickness, diameter, and length, and the

correct application of which is essential to the safety of steam-boilers : it is this

that the intensity of the pressure on the outside of a tube required in order to make

it collapse, varies directly as the square of the thickness nearly, inversely as

the diauieter, and inversely as the length. The fact of the resistance to collapse

vaiyiug inversely as the length had never even been suspected until it was brought

to light by Dr. Fairbairn's researches ; and he also pointed out the remedy for that

cause of wealmess in the use of stifi'ening rings for dividing the length of the tube

into intervals of a length consistent with safety. The fifth of those reports con-

tains the first detennination, with any approach to precision, of fha factor of safety

in engineering sti-uctures of wi'ought iron. (The corresponding factor for cast

iron had been determined by the Parliamentary Commissioners on the Application

of Iron to Railway Sti-uctm-es.) It had long been well known that the load which

   Motive Pou-er. The obtaining of motive power by means of steam has to a great

extent been considered by committees of the British Association in connexion with

whicli appeared in detail in the Philosopliical Trausactious ; but the importance

of the results contained in them makes it necessary to refer to them now. Those
results constitute the first direct determination of the density of steam ; and besides

their practical value, they furnish a most remarkable confirmation of the djiiamical
theoiy of heat, because they agree very nearly with the densities of steam which

had been deduced from the laws of its pressure and latent heat four or five years
before, by calculation according- to the principles of thermodynamics. 4. Steam-
Boiler Explosions, 1863, by the Astronomer Koyal, showing the great explosive

energy possessed by a mass of liquid water at a high temperature.
    It has been established beyond the possibility of doubt, according to the second

law of thermodynamics, that the utmost quantity of work which can be got by the

expenditure of a given quantity of heat depends solely on the limits of temperatm-e

between which the engine works, and is independent of the nature of the fluid to
which the heat is applied, such as water, ether, air, ammonia, &c. The means
of improving the economy of heat in thermodynamic engines are of three
kinds : first, working expansively, so as to obtain from the lieat applied to the
fluid all the work that is possible between given limits of temperature,---this has

probably been already earned to the utmost extent practicable ; secondly, increasing

--the range between those limits of temperature, to this there are bouud.s set in

practice by the conditions of durability and safety ; and thirdly, dimiuishiug the
quantity of heat which goes to waste from the furnace. The last is probalily the
means which at present holds out the greatest probability of improvement upon the
economy of the most economical steam-engines of the present time. It is probable

that the use of rock-oil as fuel may contribute towards that result ; and something
may perhaps be hoped from the direct use of the products of combustion to drive

the engine. 5. Gun-cotton, 1863-05. In these reports by a Committee, it is

ferring more especially to this last-mentioned series of reports (and also to the

archives of the British Association contain, perhaps, the greatest mass of data of

experiment and practice ever brought together for the pui-pose of improving the
science of the designing and propiilsion of vessels. The bulk of that mass of in-
formation is so great that it was resolved last year to appoint a committee for the

purpose of condensing it ; and a report by that committee will be laid before this

On ilie Difficultij of ohtaininr/ Local Information after reaching tJie Summits

  of Eminences from which extensive Vieivs are obtained. By J. Van-Nokden

   Bazalgette.

To supply trustworthy topographical information, the author proposed that local

indicators should be placed upon summits which are periodically visited by tourists.
The Local TopogTaphical Indicator would consist of a circular table of stone or metal,

engraved with radial lines pointing in the direction of any object of interest.

LTpon the line would be engraved the name of the object, its distance from the

point of view, and, in the case of mountains, giving their coiTect height above the
Asea.
                         _  table of three feet in diameter would be sufliciently large to embrace a

district of thirty miles- in radius, which would generally be found sufficient. To

facilitate reference, concentric lines, at distances of fi-\-e luiles, would be engraved

upon the table, v\-itliin which circles the names of places at such distances would
appear. Upon an outer circle, the names, directions and distances of large cities,

cathedrals, dockyards, headlands, and other objects of interest beyond the thirty-

mile circle would be shown. In the centre of the table may be placed a telescope,

mwith an indicating hand, arranged so that on placing the hand the direction of

any object, the object itself, if within the range of sight, would be brought within

the field of the telescope. Arrangements are now being made by the author for

the erection of a local indicator, with a telescope and light ornamental shelter,                     1

upon the summit of the Malvern Beacon Hill, in Worcestershire. The form of
the local indicator may be varied according to circumstances. It may be cheapiv

constructed in cast iron, and with or without the telescope and building. The

local indicator would aflbrd to the tourist much of the interest and information

whicli is frequently lost in consequence of fogs enveloping the summit which with

difficulty he has reached, and would at once point out the direction for returning
-- Aa want which the author has frequently experienced.

plicated form of indicator would be useful in open places in large towns, the
direction and distances to clim-ches, railway stations, tlieatres, &c. being given.
The tops of letter pillar-boxes being provided with such information, would assist

On the Methods for Testing the Speed of Vessels over the Measured Mile.

                     By Admiral Sir E. Beichee, K.C.B.

The author pointed out that the trial of a vessel over one mile could not be

considered  any test of    her  real  speed  or  capabilities                                                      besides which, he thought
                                                                                                                ;

the taking the speed should not be entnisted to those on board. He considered

that the force and action of the tides had not been duly ascertained, inasmuch as

experience had shown him that, while the surface-tide appeared by the buoys to

be running a strong ebb, an undercmTent was running flood, and exercising a con-

siderable influence on the body of the vessel immersed. This underneath cm-rent

he thought would vitiate any results obtained by the course generally pursued for

testing the speed of vessels. He would suggest a series of experiments similar to

those can-ied out by himself at Kingston in 1835 to test the strength of this under-

cm-rent. He proposed further that the speed should be tested on terra firma,

where umpires should decide, by a pair of fixed theodolites, the times of transit.

Taking away from those on board any control over the starting moment, he would

cause them to indicate by intersections, every ten minutes, the exact course the

vessel had pursued. As regards the mode of "trial, the run should be for twenty-

four hours at least. She should have a supply of coal for thirty hours. At the

end of the run, her remaining coal should be carefully measured, the general tem-

perature of the engine-room should be carefully noted, the condition of the paint

on her funnel examined, to ascertain whether the firing has been excessive, and a

fidl report should be made as to how she had behaved against a head sea, her

easiness of steering, &c.

                  On Beaping-Machinery. By the Eev. P. Bell.

   After giving an account of the modes of reaping corn in use from the earliest

times, pointing out how little alteration had been made in them down to modern

days, the author narrated the cii-cumstances under which he had been led to give
his attentioji to the subject, and ultimately to succeed in constructing, in the year
1828, a reaping machine, which, although it did not tlien come into general use,
was efficient for the purpose, and which, in fact, was, with scarcely any alteration,
the reaping machine of the present day.

             On the Birmingham Wire Gauge. By Latimer Clark.

--various gauges in use made serious differences in contracts in one instance in

which the author was concerned a money difference of £8000 in one contract.

     The Results of E.vperiments on the Rigidity of Glass, Brass, and Steel.

                                  By Dr. J. D. Everett.

   The author described the ingenious arrangements by which the experiments
were carried on, and the minute deflections measured.' Cylindrical rods, about
one-third of an inch in diameter, of flint-glass, dr&vra brass and steel, were alter-
nately bent and twisted by known couples, so applied that the couple (whether
of flexure or tension) was always uniform through the whole length of the rod.
The amounts of bending and twisting thus produced in a given portion of the
                                                               --

 rod were measured by the aid of two mirrors clamped to tlie rod. In tlie earlier
 experiments, these mirrors were made to reflect a dark line placed in front of a
 lamp-flame, and the displacements of the images were measured on a screen. In
 the later experiments, two telescopes were placed almost vertically over the two
 mirrors, so as to look down into them, and a sheet of paper (cross-ruled) was
 fixed in a horizontal position overhead. The displacements of the lines on this

 sheet as seen in the telescopes were then observed. From the measurements of

 flexure and tension thus obtained, the coeiHcients of elasticity and rigidity for
 the substances operated on were calculated.

    On the Iron and Steel sJioivn at tlic Paris Exhibition. By Jo5N Feknle.

    The author stated that a great deal had been said about the advance the French
had made in this department, but he thought this was erroneous. Coal was sent
into France free of duty, and English raw iron -^-ith a veiy small duty. When,
 however, the English came to send their finished iron into France, it was practi-
 cally prohibited by the duty imposed. The only iron in the Exhibition from

England was from the best Yorkshire houses, and a very few others. He first

 called attention to the large girders. There were several specimens of these
 exhibited in the French department, which were larger than any ever rolled in
this coimtry. These girders were 3 feet 7 inches in depth, but only 12 feet long
a length wholly inadequate in proportion to their depth. The length for all prac-
tical purposes should be at least fifteen times the depth. These were mere tours

cle force. He believed that the process of building up snch masses of iron, and

the frequent reheatings and coolings necessary for the purpose, would not produce

--a girder anything like equal to a girder made in the ordinary way of boiler-plates

riveted together. These girders, in the opinion of the author, had been made for
the purpose of going beyond the English people, and not so much for their prac-
tical value--in short, to excel the English in this respect. Another process of
the manufacture was that of stamping, lately introduced, and which has been very
largely carried out by the French. This process was to make a complicated forg-
ing in small pieces, then fix them together, put it in the furnace, and raise to a
welding heat, bring it under an immense die or hammer, and thus complete the
process of forging. This process had not come into general use in this countrj^
but one English house had shown several specimens quite equal in manufacture
to those exhibited bj^ the French. The manufacture of steel in large masses, ex-
hibited by Krupp and the Bocuni Company, far exceeded in size anything as yet
manufactured in England. The specimens from the Bocum Company were, in the
opinion of the author, deserving of special mention. Twenty-two railway-wheels
of" cast steel, in one casting, were, he believed, the finest ever exhibited. So far as
France is concerned, England had not been excelled in any department in the ma-

nufacture of iron or steel.

An Account of Berv/stroenis Boring MacJune, used at the Perseherg Mines,

                           Siueden. Bij Dr. C. Le Neve Foster.
   The author described a small machine for boring holes for blasting. The ma-
chine had taken the place of human labom\applied to the maUet and ordinarj'

borer or drill. It weighed only 122 lbs., cost £22 10«., and was worked by com-
pressed air. The air-compressor, pipes for conveying the air, and other details,
were described ; and the author then proceeded to an account of tlie general
results which had been arrived at by careful experiment, showing that it liad
been found that the driving of a level was done twice as quickly by using the
machine as it could be done by hand labour, and with a saving of 20 to 25 per
cent, in money.

           On the Application of Machinery to Boring and Tunnelling.

                                    By General Haupt.

   The autlior gave an account of the circiunstanees under which he had been led
to consider the possibility of applying steam to tunnelling, an application which
engineers had universally pronounced impracticable, but which he had demonstrated
to be not only possible, but, under certain circumstances, highly advantageous.
The author then explained the construction of his driUing-engine, the mode of
mounting, the appliances for erecting and removing tlie machines, the power to
drive them, the questions of ventilation, lighting, blasting by electricity, and the
application of the system to Cornish mining. Tlie construction of the' machines
was explained by means of diagrams, without which it would be hopeless to attempt
a description. On the subject of power, the author discussed the question of com-
pressed air, the loss of power in compression and transmission, the possibility of
using steam by the aid of a vacuum-pipe, the superiority of the ventilation, &c.
From experiments made by the author at the Franklin tunnel, the enormous loss
of power by passage of air through pipes has been practically measured. As an
instance of the advantage of using large pipes, it was stated' by General Haupt
that with 110 square inches of cross-section, 550 horse-power would be required
to pass 3674 cubic feet of air per minute through a pipe four miles long, whereas
less than ten horse-power would suffice if the pipe had a cross-section of ten square

feet. In the course of the reading of the paper. General Haupt alluded to the mili-
tary railway bridges constructed during the civil war in America, and he explained
the system by diagrams on the blackboard, and showed how a bridge had been
constructed in four days and a half, chiefly by the aid of negroes, which was 600

feet long, and nearly 100 feet high, the timber being cut from the stump.

    On the Iron and Steel at the Paris Exhibition. By Ferdinand Kohn,

   The collection of iron and steel in the Paris Exhibition was one of the most com-
plete and instructive representations of the present state of iron metallurgy in
aU its branches which could have been brought together at any one spot under any
circumstances. The wi-iter then spoke of the main cause of the gi-eat industrial

--revolution now witnessed an invention with which the British Association had an
--historical connexion the Bessemer process, which process had been most suc-

cessfid dm-ing the eleven years of its existence. He next referred to those much-
admired steel castings of Khenish Prussia, which had caused st) much interest and

curiosity by their extraordinary sizes and qualities, and he referred to the secrecy
and mystiti'cation which surrounded their manufacture, arising, in his opinion, from
the want of an effective patent lawiu Prussia. In conclusion, he remarked that

the vague notion now existing in Britain that the superiority and predominance of

British iron manufacture had ceased to exist, or was threatened to be overthrown
by continental competitors, had no fomidation, judging by tlie state of things in

the Palis Exhibition.

   This boiler is constructed with a series of undulating flues, instead of the or-

experiments made with marine boilers of this construction show a very considerable
economy in the quantity of fuel rec[uired, and also the evaporation of a given C|uan-
tity of water in a given time. This boiler occupies the same space, and is ex-
teiTially of the same form, as the ordinary tubular boiler.

On the Theory of Diagrams of Forces as applied to Boofs and Bnclges.

                By J. Cleek Max^a-ell, F.R.SS. L. 4- E.

A Aroof is made up of a series of vertical frames.  diagram of forces is a figure

consisting of straight lines, which represent, both in magnitude and direction, the

tensions and pressures in the different pieces between the joints of the frame. The

pieces of the frame and the weights acting on it are denoted by capital letters, and

the corresponding lines of the diagram by small letters. The diagram is constructed

--by the following ride, which is sufficient for the purpose : The frame, including the

vertical lines representing the weights, and the diagrams of forces, are reciprocal

mfigures, such that every line in the one is parallel to the corresponding line the

other, and every set of lines which meet in a point in the one figure foi-m a closed

figure in the other. It follows from this that the weights, which are all vertical
forces, are represented by the parts of one vertical line. The first extension of the
principle of the diagram of forces was made by Dr. Eankine in his 'Applied

Mechanics.' The theory was generalized by the author in the Philosophical
Mao-azine in April 1864. In the present paper it is shown to be connected with

the'^theoiy of reciprocal polars in solid geometry, and rules for the construction of

diaorams are o-iven. The advantage of the method is that its construction requires

only a parallel ruler, and that every force is represented to the eye at once by a

separate line, which may be measured with sufficient accm-acj' for all purposes with

less trouble than the forces can be found by calcidation. It also affords secuiity

ao'ainst error, as, if any mistake is made, the diagram cannot be completed.

On Covered Life-Boats. By George Maav, F.S.A., F.G.S., Sj-c.

In advocating the employment of closely-covered boats for shipwreck service

from vessels at sea, the author pointed out the different requirements from those

eno-ao-ed in coast service. In rescuing from the land the crews of coast-wrecked

vessels, the power of navigation and locomotion was of paramount necessity,

whilst in the case of vessels foundering at sea, the means of locomotion was alto-

gether of secondary iniportance to such qualities as would provide for the cer-

tainty of floatation. To ensure this, the author proposed a light boat-shaped iron

caisson, perfectly covered, except a man-hole for access, which woidd be water-
Atight when closed, and two openings for ventilation.
                                                         self-acting valvular

an'angement was described, by which water would be perfectly excluded during

the occasional breaking of a wave, whilst allowing a free passage of air when

not submerged.

On the Use of Moveable Seats for Slide- Valves. By James 11. jSTapier, F.B.S.,

    Murine Engineer, and W.' J. Macquoen Eakkine, C.E., LL.B., F.R.S.

   The great practical convenience of the slide-valve and link-motion as_ means of

varying the rate of expansion in steam-engines is well known. An objection to

their use, however, arises from the fact, that the points of admission, cut-off,
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                     157

release, and compression are related to each other in such a manner that, in
designing a slide-valve motion, the fixing of any three of those points for a given
position of the link fixes the fourth point also. For example, suppose that in a
certain position of the link, the positions of the eccentrics and the lap or cover at
the eduction-edge of the cylinder-port are so adjusted as to give a certain rate of
expansion: then the only element remaining capable of adjustment is the cover
at the eduction-edge of the port ; and that element, when it is fixed, fixes at once
the release and the compression ; and it often happens that the best positions of
the points of release and of compression are inconsistent with each other ; so that
a compromise has to be made. That objection, in some examples of slide-valve
motions, has been overcome by the use of double-slides; but in all the double

slide-valve motions hitherto introduced, there exists the defect of complexity in
construction and working; for in addition to the ordinary handle of the link-

motion, a second handle has to be used in varjang the rate of expansion. The
authors of this paper propose to accomplish the same residt in a very simple way,
by giving a small sliding motion to that part of the valve-seat which contains the
induction-edges of the cylinder-ports, so as alternately to contract and enlarge
those ports at each stroke of the engine. The only mechanism required, in addi-
tion to the ordinary slide-valve gear, consists in the moveable seat, with a rod
and a third eccentric to give it motion : the rate of expansion is varied, when
required, by shifting the link in the ordinary way by the use of the ordinary handle
alone yet the effect is the same as if the admission and the exhaust of the steam

                       ;

were regulated by two different slide-valves, each with its own link-motion and

pau" of eccentrics. Hence, in designing the valve-motion, the points of release and
compression can be adjusted to the best positions, independentlj^ of the points of
admission and cut-off. The authors consider that the moveable seat which they
propose ought to be used together with a kind of slide-valve on which the pres-
sure of the steam is balanced, such as that introduced by Mr. Thomas xA.dams, in
order that the different rates of travel of the slide-valve over the fixed and

moveable parts of the valve-seat may not produce unequal wear.

               The Relation of the Upper and Lower Crags in Norfolk.

                 By JoHJf E. Taylor, Hon. Sec. Norwich Oeol. Soc.

   The object of this paper was to prove that the present classification of shells in
the Norwich Crag is ^imperfect on account of an upper bed being included in the
Crag. The mean percentage of the shells from the two crags makes the relation
of the Red and Norwich Crags very dissimilar, whereas there is really a near con-
nexion between them. By separating the shells of the upper bed, the underlying
Norwich Crag approaches the Red, whilst the upper bed itself forms a graduating
link between the three Crags and the overlying Drift beds.

   After giving the established percentages of recent and extinct shells in the three
Crags, as well as the proportion of arctic shells foimd in them, the author men-

tioned several places in ^lOrfolk where the Upper Crag may be seen overlying the

Norwich Crag, as at Coltishall, Horstead, Trowse, Thorpe, Whitlingham, and
Bramerton. The height of the upper bed ranges above the lower from 3 to 15 feet.
It is marked by the total absence of freshwater shells, by the paucity of littoral
species, and by the abundance of deeper sea-shells. It is also distinguished by
the greater abundance of arctic species, as at Bramerton and Thorpe, where several
species of Astarte, Cyprina ishtncUca^ Cardium groenlandicum, Lucina borealis, and
others abound.

158 REPORT--1867.

   The author also showed that the shells of the Eed and Norwich Crags separated
them into distinct beds, whilst the same method would also separate the Upper
from the Lower Crag- in Norfolk. He therefore contended for the existence of
four Crags instead ol' the present classification of them into three. This arrange-
ment established a complete and beautiful sequence between the oldest Coralline

Crag and the latest Drift deposits.

     On tlie Internal Heat of the Earth. By Dr. Julius Schvaecz, F.G.S.

   The author reviewed the evidence upon which is founded the doctrine of central
heat as applied to the earth. It is based on three arguments : one, gathered from

--volcanic phenomena phenomena which may be explained by the chemical and

electro-chemical schools of geologists at least as satisfactorily as by the supporters
of central fire ; the second argument is deduced from the nebular hypothesis, an
h-^'pothesis ha-\'ing now-a-days no other foundation than what is involved in it from
the central-fire hypothesis ; and the third is deduced from the supposed uniform

increase of temperature down to the centre of our planet, in every part of the earth,

--an argument which, again, is a mere hypothesis.

   Having carefully studied the literatm-e of the subject, Dr. Schvarcz criticised the
observations upon which the hypothesis of central fire is supported, and showed

how imperfect and conflicting is the evidence to prove that the increase of imder-

ground temperature is reallj^ general and uniform.

   Before generalizing, we must accuuudate a greater number of facts, jirecisely re-
corded, than are at present at command ; and he therefore urged geologists to com-

bine all their efforts in order to multiply geothermometrical observations, especially

in countries now unexplored.
   He was of opinion that solar impressions, in all the climates on our earth's sur-

face, taken collectively, and local reservoirs of lava, not exceeding considerably the
depth of thirty-fi-^e geographical miles, and manifesting themselves through volcanic
cones from local processes of oxidation, mast be taken for those secondary causes
which remain indispensable elements of any tetiology of underground temperatures,
even for theories to come. Electricity, as connected with cosmical magnetism and

planetary rotation, may have been an important agent, besides the secondary causes

j ust alluded to.

heureuse idee pour rtltablir co parallelisme de comparer le membre superieur droit

an membre inferieur gauche et rice versa ; mais alors le ponce de la main est en

dehors, et le gros  orteil du pied, qui est son analogue,  en dedans                                                 ce qui viole la loi

assiiiiile le radius an tibia et le cubitus an peron^, sans expliquer pourquoi la rotule
analogue de I'olecrane estfix(5e an tibia, tandis qu'elle devrait faire partie du perone.

En 1832 Bourgery,pour r(5soudre cette difficulte, pretendait que la partie superieure

du tibia avec la rotule representait le cubitus surmonte de I'oli^crane, tandis que la

partie inferieure du meme os correspondait an radius : de meme selou lui la partie

superieure du perone etait le radius, sa partie infdrieure le cubitus. Cette hypothese,

connue en France sous le nom d'h;/potJiese du croisemerd, fut adoptee en 1843 par M.

Cruveilhier, qui la formula nettement ; mais dans cette maniere de voir, I'avant-bras

6tant en pronation, le cubitus et le radius se croismt tandis que le perone et le tibia

sont paralleles entre enx. De plus, il est conti-aire a toutes les lois connues des

coalescences de supposer qu'un os long pent etre forme par la soudure bout a bout

--celle que je propose.
   Explication de rauteur. L'liumerus, cbez THoranie et les iSIammiferes terrestres oU

aquatiques, est un os tordu sur son axe de 180 degres, ou d'une demi-circonferenee :

le femur est un os droit sans torsion. L'bumerus etaut uu femur tordu, si I'on

veut comparer ces deux os il faut avant tout clc'tordre l'bumerus ; le resultat de cette
operation est de placer Tepitrocblee en dehors et I'epicoudyle en dedans. Cela fait,

la comparaison des niembres u'oflVe plus aucune difficult^ : en eflet le col de l'bume-

rus est dirige en dedans comnie celui du femur. La partie convexe ou tricipitale

de I'os du bras se trouve en avant comnie la partie convexe ou tricipitale de I'os de

la cuisse. Les deux os sont done semblables ; leurs condjies articidaires se contour-

nent en arriere ; I'olecrane est en avant, comnie la rotule ; de plus elle est attacbtJe
a la portion auterieiire et externe de la tete du tibia, qui represeute (comme je le

prouverai plusbas) la portion olecranienne de la tete du cubitus, qui s'est soudee et

confondue avec celle du radius. Pour se convaincre de la r^alite de la torsion de

I'bimierus, il suffit de suivre sur un humerus d'bonime ou de quadrupede la ligne

apre qui part de I'epicondyle, se dirige obliquement vers la face posterieure, la con-

tourue en longeaiit la gouttiere de torsion du iierf radial, et vient aboutir a la partie

--la plus marquee du col au-dessous de la tete de riiumerus. Cette torsion a ete reiiiar-

quee par la plupart des autbropotomistes Bertin, Lecat, Winslow, Sabatier, Soem-

mering, Bicbat, Boyer, Barclay, Meckel, J. Cloquet, H. Cloquet, Lauth, O. Ward, Blan-

din, Estor, Cruveilhier, Ilolmes-Coote, Janiiii, Sappey, Henle, G. M. Humphry, et L.

Holden. C'est la torsion qui transforme le sens de la flexion, puisque I'avant-bras

se flecbit en avant, tandis que le jambe se fli5chit en arriere. Mr. Holnies-Coote est,

a nia connaissance, le seul anatomiste qui ait yu cette consequence de la torsion.

   Elle est toujours de 180°; mais les rapports des axes du col etde la troclilee ne
sont pas les memes dans toute la s^rie. Chez FHomnie et les Singes anthropomoi-pbes

(Orang, Cbimpanse, Gorille et Gibbon) les axes du col du femur et de riiumerus

sont dirig(?s tons deux vers la colonne vertebrale, savoir de dehors en dedans et Ae bas

en haut. Cette direction des axes est la condition mdcanique des niouvemens de

circumduction du bras, qui decrit un cone autour de cet axe id^al. Dans les qua-

drupedes terrestres et ampliibies, I'axe du col de Ihumerus est dirige d'avant en

arriere. La consequence de cette derniere disposition c'est que dans les quadrupedea

le membre auterieur se meut dans uu plan et n'execute plus les niouvemens de cir-

cumduction qui caracterisent THomme et les Singes antliroponiorphes.

Merianee. Surle Cameleon, au conteaire, rhumerus est tordu de 180° ; car le Ca-
meleon est im reptile qui ne rampe pas ; il marclie, comme un quadi'umane, en
fleehissaiit son avant-bras en a\ant. Son ventre ni sa queue ue trainent par terre.

Comme les Singes, il saisit les branches avec ses quati-e mains, et enroule sa queue

prenante autour des branches qui lui servent de support. Dans les Cli6loniens la
torsion n'est visible que sur les grandes Tortues terrestres et fluviatiles et dans les
Bateaciens, sur les Crapauds et les grosses GrenouiUes. Cette torsion de
rhumerus de 90^, commune aux Eeptiles et aux Oiseaux, est un trait de plus a
aj outer aux nombreuses ressemblances organiques qui rapprochent ces deux classes

d'animaux.

  --Origine de la Torsion. Je dois aborder maintenant ime question d'autant plus

delicate qu'elle est du domaine de la metaphysique, et touche aux lois les plus
intimes du developpement des etres organises. Quand on examine des squelettes
de fcetus humains depuis deux mois jusqu'a neuf, le corps de Thumerus se presente
sous la forme d'une palette aplatie et identique, sauf la grandeur, a celle du femur.

On n'y remarque pas la plus 16gere trace de torsion. Cette torsion n'est meme

visible que siu- un enfant d'lm an, et ce n'est qu'a deux ans qu'elle est parfaitement
caracterisee. Cependant du jour ou les membres se montrent sur le fcetus la
torsion existe, puisque la flexion du bras se fait en avant. La torsion de I'humerus
n'est done point une torsion mecanique qui s'opere a une certaine epoque de la vie,
c'est une torsion virtuelle qui ne s'est jamais op^ree niecaniquement ; mais cette
torsion \-irtuelle a eu toutes les consequences d'une torsion reelle. Tout dans le
bras est dispose comme si elle s'etait physiquement elfectuee : les muscles, les
arteres, les nerfs ont suivi le mouvement de rotation de I'extremitiS inferieure de
I'humerus. Les autres dissemblances enti-e le bras et la cuisse sont de simples
consequences de cette torsion. J'ose esperer que le lecteur partagera cette convic-
tion ; car je demontrerai que la disposition de toutes les parties moUes du membre
thoracique comparee a celle des parties correspondantes du membre abdominal ne
s'explique que par la torsion de I'humerus : il est le seal as long dont le corps soit
ainsi coutom-ne en heUce : en lui imprimant cette forme la nature nous d^voile le

procede simple et rationnel par lequel le sens de la flexion devient anterieui" ou

externe de posti^rieur qu'il (5tait.

   Nous trouvons dans I'histoire naturelle d'autres exemples de ces efiets virtuels.
La queue unique des poissons doubles figures par M. Coste n'a qu'une coloime
vertebrale : ^irtuellement cependant les deux colonnes existent dans la queue du
poisson double ; mais la colonne centrale ne s'est pas developpee. Dans les vege-
taux, memes faits ; dans toutes les Labiees la levre superieure de la corolle est a
un ou deux lobes, et elle contient les ^tamines, qui sont conve.ves en dessus. Mais

dans la tiibu des Ocimoiddes (Oci'wH«H, Orthosiphon, Plcctranthus, Colcus, &c.) la
levre sup(5riem"e est a 4 lobes; I'inferieure, h un seul, coiTespond aux (5tamines, qui

sont concaves en dessus. II est admis par tons les botanistes que dans cette tiibu
la corolle est renversee ; et cependant jamais aucun d'eux n'a vu ce renversement

s'operer : la fleur nait renversee, comme I'humerus nait tordu; je m'en suis assure sur

des boutons de fleurs de VOcimian carnosum, qui n'avaient pas plus d'un millimetre
de long. Dans toute cette tribu de vegetaux il y a douc un renversement virtuel

--analogue a la torsion virtuelle de I'humerus des vertebres.
    Composition de la tete fe'morale du tibia. Nous avous a demontrer actuelle-
ment que le chapiteau du tibia chez I'llomme et la plupart des Marimiferes
est form(§ par la coalescence, la soudure des tetes du cubitus et du radius
reunis. Tons les anatomistes ont ^te frappes de la disproportion du tibia et

du perone ; le premier formant ime colonne massive, terminee sup^rieuremeut
par un i^norme chapiteau ; le second, long, grele, amiuci, dvidemment atrophia

et souveut reduit, comme chez le cheval et les ruminans, a une simple apophyse

styloide. II semble qu'en se transformant en tibia le radius se soit developp^

aux depens du cubitus, ou plutot I'ait incorpore a lui. C'est ce qui a lieu en
realite, puisqvie le chapiteau du tibia est forme par la coalescence des tetes du

cubitus et du radius. En effet on remarque sm- le tibia deux faces articulaires
comme celles du cubitus et du radius. L'epine qui separe les deux svu-faces articu-
laires ne correspond pas, comme on le dit generalement, a la crete qiu va du sommet

de I'olecrane a I'apophyse coronoide, mais a I'intervalle qui separe la tete du cubitus

de la cupule articulaire du radius. Si Ton place a cote I'lin de Taiitre im coude et

ixn genou de sc[uelette humain, et qu'on les regarde de profil, il est impossiLle de

meconnaitre la ressemblauce prodigieuse de la Crete auterieiire du tibia a partir de

I'insertiou du ligament rotulien jusqu'au dessous du tiers superieur de I'os, avec la

Crete posterieure du cubitus, qui part de I'olecraue et se prolonge (5galement jus-

qu'au dessous du tiers superieur de I'os. Toutes deux sont tranchantes, toutes deux

offrent a leur partie moyenne une incurvation daus le ineiue sens. Qu'on admette

done ime coalescence des deux tetes du radius et du culjitus, ou qu'on dise simple-

nient que le radius s'est developpe aux depens du cubitus pour former la tete du tibia,

toujours est-il qu'on ue saurait nier le caractcve cubital de la portion anteriem'e du

Atiers superiem' du tibia.      partir de I'incurvation de la crete, la coalescence cesse,

et la partie inferieure du perone correspond a celle du cubitus seul, tandis que la

partie infeiieiu-e du tibia represente imiquement celle du radius.

L'analogie de la rotule et de I'olecrane a ete reconuue par Winslow, Vicq-d'AzjT,

Sabatier, Soemmering, Boyer, Meckel, Gerdy, J. Cloquet, Bourgery, Blandiu, O.

Ward, Cruveilhier, Henle, CI. M. Humphry, &c. L'anatomie comparee confirme

cette analogie. Dans les Pteropus, la Chauve-souiis vampire, et le Pingoiiin, I'ole-

crane est separe du cubitus comnie la rotule du tibia. Daus les Reptiles et les Oiseaiix

les deux os manquent a la fois.

   Une continuation de ce que nous avous dit sur la composition du cliapiteau du

tibia se trouve dans les Marsupiaux, tels que Phaxcolomys, Phalaitgkta, Dasi/i/rus et

Opossum. Dans le Phascolomjis wombat le tibia et le perone sont de meme gros-
sem-, le perone s'articule avec le femiu- comme le cubitus avec I'humerus, et il porte
une rotule dont la forme est la meme que celle de I'olecraue de I'animal. La crete

du tibia manque. Dans cet animal le perone avec sa rotule represente exactement
le cubitus, et le tibia correspond au radius seid. On trouve une conformation

analogue dans le Dasi/unis macrouru^, le Didelphys Azairc, Phahuu/ista ndpiiia,

P. C'ookii et auti-es. Dans I'Ornithorliynque le tibia et le perone sont surmoutes, le

premier d'lme rotule, le second d'uue apopliyse olecranienne. L'appareil rotulien

du genou etant double, l'appareil olecrauieu du coude Test egalemeut, et I'olecrane

est bifurque et se termine par deux crochets. En resume, dans les Phascolomes,

les Phalangers, les Dasyures et les Opossum, ou le tibia ue represente que le radius,

le peroue, au contraire, le cubitus tout entier, la rotide s'insere au perone comme

I'olecrane est imi au cubitus.

Si I'on compare le coude et le genou dans les Mammiferes ordinaires, et en par-

ticulier dans les Inaectivores, les Rongeurs, les Ruminans, et les Solipedes, on

--arrive aux conclusions suivantes : 1. La tete du cubitus, c'est-a-dire I'olecrane,

et la crete qui lui fait suite dans le tiers superieur de I'os, existent dans tous les

Mammiferes terrestres et amphibies. Les parties correspondantes du genou, savoir,

la rotule et la crete anterieure de I'os jusqu'au dessous de son tiers superieure, sont

Au^galenient constautes. 2.     contraire, le corps du cubitus, ou plus exactement,

cet OS, moins I'olecrane et la crete qui lui fait suite, n'est pas constant, il s'atro-

phie ou se confond avec le radius. Le perone, qui correspond 2»'ecisement a cette

portion du corps cubital, non seulement s'atrophie et diniinue de longuem* en

s'amincissant, mais disparait meme completement dans le Dromadaire.

   La comparaison du pied avec la main par "N'icq-d'Azyr a ete admise par tous les
anatomistes; il en est de meme de I'epaide et du bassin; mais il ne faut pas, comme

lui, comparer I'ileura droit a I'epaule gauche : il faut placer uu petit niiroir sous

Tangle inferieure de I'omoplate d'un squelette : en regardant I'image de cette omo-

plate dans le niiroir, on reconnait, pour ainsi dire, I'ileum place au dessous, et Ton

constate que la clavicule coiTespond a la branche horizontale du pubis, I'apophyse

coracoide a I'ischion, le bord spinal de I'omoplate a la crete de I'os des iles, Tangle

infeiieur de I'omoplate a Tepine anterieure et superievu'e de Tileum, la fosse sus-

epineuse a la fosse iliaque externe, la crete de I'omoplate et Tacromiou a la crete

qui separe le petit du moyen fessier. Dans I'Ornithorj-nque et YEchidna le bassin

et I'epaule se ressemblent completement.

L'auteur a presente a la Section une preparation osteologique qui realise ses idees.

L'humerus est detordu et le radius transforme en tibia par Taddition de la partie

olecranienne du cubitus : I'olecrane, separe par la scie, represente la rotule j et le

corps du cubitus^ aminci dans sons tiers superieur, simule parfaitement le perone.

cbez rHomme.                                           la partie superieure du bras I'ai-tere Israchiale est placee, comme

la crurale, en dedans et en arant de la tete de I'humerus ; mais la crurale contoiime
le femur vers le quart inferieur de I'os, et passe derri'ere liii pour se placer entre ses

condyles, oii elle pi-end le uoni de poplit^e. L'hunierus etant un femur tnrclu, son
mouvement de rotation a eu pour efiet de ramener les condyles en avant et d'en-
trainerrartere,qui, conservant les memes relations avec les parties ossenses, se trouve
placee en avant dans le pli du bras. La radiale con-espond a la tibiale post(5rieure

la cubitale a la peronierc ; les interosseuses de la jambe a celles du bras.

   Comme les systemcs musculaires et art^riels, le systeme neiTeux demontre la

realite de la torsion de Thum^rus. Un des troncs uen'eux, le sciatique, a la cuisse

le UK^dian, et le cubital au bras, sont dans le plan de la flexion. Les deux autres

nerfs, le crural anterieur, a la cuisse, le radial, au bras, dans le plan de I'extension.

Mais a la cuisse tons les nerfs principaux restent dans le plan oil ils so trouraient

Aua leur origine.                                      bras, au contraire, le median et le cubital obeissent a cette loi,

tandis que le nerf radial quitte le plan interne des le quart superieur du mcmbre, se

dirige eu arriere, coutourne I'os en helice, suivaut sa lignc de torsion, y laisse

I'empreinte de son passage et ressort sur la face exteme de I'os pour se distribuer

aux muscles qui s'y inserent. Tons les anatomir-tes out ete frappes de la singrdarite

de ce trajet, qui ne s'explique ni par des conditions de sym(?trie, ni par des adapta-

tions  fonctionnellcs                                                                 car  pour  gagner  les  muscles de la partie exteme du bras                                                                                                                                                                           le

chcmin le plus coiut etait de passer entre le biceps et le liracliial ant(5rieur. Senle,

la torsion de rhumerus rend compte des difterences qui existent cnti-e les systemes

nerveux du bras et de la cuisse. Je suis parvenu a realiser mecaniquement la

transformation de I'appareil nerveux de la ciusse en appareil nerveux du bras.

Yoici comment. Je iixe le chef d'lm cordon noir denicre un femur du c6t(5 droit

entre les deux trocbanteiirs. Ce cordon represeute le tronc sciatique. Je fixe son

autre extr^mite, qui figm-e le nerf sciatique poplite interne, entre les deiix condyles

femoraiix. Du milieu de ce cordon en part un second, qui s'attaclie an condyle
externe ou peroneal et simule le nerf poplite externe. Un autre cordon noir,

attache en dedans du condyle interne ou tibial, represente le nerf crural. Je place

ensuite ce femur sur une table. Sa convexite est toiu-nse en baut; le nerf sciatique

Unet ses deux branches sont deniere I'os, dans leur position naturelle.  aide tient

lacbement I'extremite libre du cordon, qui represente le nerf crural, au-dessus de

la tete du femur. Les cboses ainsi disposees, je fais tournervers moi le femiu- et le

cordon representant le nerf sciatique, de 180°. Le sciatique, suivant le mouvement

de rotation, se trouve place devant I'os au lieu de rester deniere, et I'extremite

inferieure du nerf crural, entrainee par le mouvement du condyle interne devenu

externe, contourne le coi-ps du femm* conmie le nerf radial contoiu-ne le corps de

I'bumerus. Par ce mouvement de rotation de 180° j'ai simule la torsion qiu trans-

forme le femur en humerus, et par cela seul j "ai transforme le sj-steme nerveux de
la cuisse en systenie nerveux du bras.

Sur les Hacines aeriferes ou Yessies ncdatoires, la synonymie et la distribution

   geograpliique de quelcpies esjyeces aquatiqiies du genre Jussisea. Par Chakles

   Maetins, Professeur et Directew du Jardin des Plantes de Montj^ellier.

   Le genre Jussicea de la Famille des Onagraires se compose actuellement d'envi-

ron 80 especes, les unes terrestres, les autres aquatiques, vegetant dans les eaux
douces et tranquilles de I'Asie, de I'Afrique, de 1' Amerique et de I'Australie. Rheede
le premier (' Hortus malabaricus,' t. ii. p. 99 et tab. 51 ; 1679) figui-a sm- les rameaux
du Jussicea rcpens du Malabar des racines blanches, spongieiises et flottantes dans
I'eau. Ces organes fm-ent re^iis par Humboldt et Bonpland sur le J. nutans de la
NouveUe Grenade, par John Sims sur le J. (/randijtora au Jardin de Kew, et par

Delile sur la meme plante, comme le prouve une note mauuscrite de sa main dans
I'herbier du Jardin de Montpellier. Plus tard de Martius donnait le nom de J.

Jielminthorhiza a une plante de Baliia, et Hasskarl decrivit avec plus de detail les
racines du J. repens de Java. Ayant reyu des gTaines du Jussicea rcpens decouvert
pres de Bone, en Algerie, et la plante vegetant tres-bieu dans le Jardin, je resolus
de I'etudier simultauement avec le J. r/ramlijtora, qui non seulement se maintient
dans un canal de I'ecole botanique depuis 1823, mais encore s'est naturalise depuis
18.30, dans la petite riviere du Lez pres Montpellier et les canaux d'imgation qui
en dependent.

  --Hacines aeriferes des JussifEa repens et J. grandiflora. Quand on ^tudie ces

deux plantes on trouve qu'eUes ont quatre sortes de racines naissant sur les lenfle-
mens des rameaux immerges qui portent egalemeut des feuilles et des fleurs. 1°.
des racines filiformes flottantes, non ramifiees, situees vers I'extremite des rameaux.
2°. des racines rameuses ou plutot pectinifoi'mes egalemeut flottantes. 3°. Des
racines egalemeut pectiniformes mais dont I'axe est devenu plus epais, blanchatre
et spongieux ; celles-ci flottantes ou s'enfonfaut dans la vase. 4°. Enfin des
racines d'un aspect different completement de celui des precedentes, simples, cylin-
driques, ou coniques, moUes, spongieuses, blanchatres ou rosees, toujours flottantes

et remplies d'une gi'ande quantite d'air, ce sont les racines aeriferes, veritables

vessies natatoires de la plante qu'eUes soutiennent a la surface de I'eau. L'examen

microscopique prouve qu'eUes se coniposent d'un faisceau vasculaiie central, puis
d'rm tissu cellulaire a gTandes mailles lacvmaires remplies d'air, qui sont en con-
tact avec I'eau sans I'intei-positiou d'lme couche epidermique. Cette structure,
comparee a celle d'une racine ordinaire ramiflee, montro que la raeine aerifere
n'est qu'une modification de la racine absorbante. Celle-ci se compose en eftet
1. d'un faisceau vasculaire central, identique a celui de la racine spongieuse
2. d'lm tissu^ cellulaire forme de rangees de cellules prismatiques juxtaposees au
 centre mais separees vers la circonference par des lacimes intercellulaires remplies

les Jussicat aquatiques jouent le role de vessies natatoires. II en est de meme dans
les animaux oii la vessie natatoire des Poissous est I'analogue du poumon des Manx-

miferes, tandis que dans les Nautiles ce sont les cbanibres de la coquille, dans cer-

tains Siphonopliores des A'esicules aeriennes ou des boucliers aeriferes, comnie dans

les Velelles, qui soutiennent I'animal a la surface ou dans une zone determinee

au-dessous de la surface de I'eau. Ainsi dans le regne animal comme dans le regne

vegetal les memes foactions sont remplies par des organes ditlerens, qui n'ont jamais
